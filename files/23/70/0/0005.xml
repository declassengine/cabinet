REPARATIONS 1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and WAR DEBTS.reported, that the situation in the matter of the(Previous Lausanne Conference had developed considerablyReference:Cabinet 4 within the last twentv-four hours .   He recalled(32), Con-clusion 1.) that on the previous day the Cabinet were stillfx. waiting to hear whether Germany would consent to a&apos; continuation of the moratorium on Hoover conditions.Since then, information had been received that theGermans would not accept.In the meanwhile the French Government wasshowing an increasing desire to appear to the world as working hand-in-hand with the British Government.For example, on the previous evening he had receiveda proposal that a joint communique should be issuedby the two Governments on the postponement of the lausanne Conference.   The Foreign Secretary had replied that we were already issuing our owncommunique.The French Debate was to be resumed in theChamber the same afternoon.M. Laval had sent a message stating.that hewould like to announce that the British and french governments were agreed in the necessity for postponing the Lausanne Conference and were suffi-ciently in accord for the British Prime Ministerto pay him a visit to Paris during the coming week-end .Meanwhile Lord Tyrrell, who had shown greatingenuity, had obtained the following revisedformula, which the French Government would be willing to accept and which he had transmitted forconsideration here:-
&quot;The British and French Governments,having taken note of the conclusionof the Basle Committee    declare thatthey are in agreement (l) to accept,so far as they are concerned, the prolongation from July 1st next andfor one year, of the moratorium nowin force;    (2) to summon for the monthof June next an International Confer-ence the task of which will &quot;be toexamine the means of finding a lasting,remedy for the economic, financial andcurrency difficulties which areresponsible for and might result inprolonging the crisis from which theworld is suffering.   Under these condi-tions they do not, so far as they areconcerned, see the necessity of theassembly at Lausanne of the conference proposed for the end of this month.&quot;The Foreign Secretary pointed out that theformula had the advantage of committing the french to the Report of the Basle Committee- and to accept-anee of a Conference in June.    In certain respects,however, the formula was ambiguous:    for instance,item (l) would at once provoke from Germany thequestion as to whether they would have to continuethe German Railway payments to the Bank for international Settlements during the moratorium.Item (2) was also ambiguous, no doubt deliberatelyso, as the French desire was to obtain the presenceof a representative of the United. States, although this was not in our interest in discussions on reparations .   Nevertheless, the Foreign Secretaryemphasised the importance, from the point of viewof the present economic situation, of reaching some agreement as to the Lausanne Conference, and this formula was undoubtedly an improvement.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Prime Minister, at the present justice and having regard to his heavypreoccupations in London, could not accept an invitation to go to Paris.But for the delays in France thepresent situation might have beenreached earlier, when a visit by thePrime Minister would not have been impossible:
(b) That in the circumstances a cordialinvitation should be sent to M. Lavalto visit London, with an indication that an invitation for a return visit to Paris would be accepted:(e) That while His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare anxious to reach complete agree-ment with Prance, nevertheless in all those matters on which German agreement is also essential they consider it important to obtain the presence of&apos;a German representative:(d) That, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should immediatelysend a telegram to Paris based onthe above decisions.

SECRET. SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION ON THE BALANCEOF TRADE Am THE CABINET  ON THURSDAYJANUARY 81.   1932.  BEGINNING AT 11 aim.AND CONTINUED AT  3 p.m.The Cabinet decided to approach the question bya review of the general situation presented by theReports before them (C.P.-25 (32), C.P.-31 (.32), andC..P.-32 (32)), and the Prime Minister first invitedmembers of the Cabinet who had not been members of theCommittee to express their views .The President of the Board of Education expressed general concurrence in the criticisms of the Reportcontained in the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s Memorandum (CP.-31(32)) and considered that the alternative proposalsof the Home Secretary were worthy of close consideration.The Secretary of State for India was prepared toaccept the Report of the Committee, with the additionalobservation that a clear decision must be reachedbefore the day on which the House of Commons meets.He&apos;thought the plan would be acceptable to the Houseof Commons if announced at the outset of the Session,but if the various proposals were dragged out stageby stage, or watered down, he thought the Governmentwould be in a difficult position in six weeks1  time.The Secretary of State for War took the same view.The Minister of Labour drew attention to thesuggestion contained in the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s Memo-randum fCP.-31 (32), foot of p.3) that the proposalsof the Committee might involve an increase of probably not less than 15 per cent, in the cost of living, andthat this was bound to cause wage troubles at a timewhen it is vital not to add to the difficulties of the
manufacturers by increasing the wage item in the costof production.   The Ministry of labour&apos;s estimate,made to the best of their ability in the time available,was that the cost of living should not exceed from5 to 5i5 points, and the probable ri.se should not bemore than 3^ to 3-f points.    Approximately, then, therise in the cost of living would be from the present figure of 47 to a little over 50.   He developed thesefigures, and the result of the discussion on this point was the Conclusion recorded in ^Cabinet 5 (32), 2.The lord Chancellor reminded the Cabinet, as hehad reminded the two previous Cabinets, that he was alawyer and not a politician.    In expressing his viewshe reserved, his right, after hearing the arguments on either side, to vary his opinion.   There were two points in the Report of the Committee (CP.-25 (32)) on whichhe laid, emphasis.   The first was page 13 &quot;(o) immediate action is imperative&quot;.   He agreed that it was impossibleto procrastinate.   The second point was page 13 &quot;(m) TheMinister should have po?:er to refuse or to attach eondi-tJons  (e.g.t re-organisation of an industry) to his approval of a duty and afterwards to suspend or removea duty fe.g.. if it were misused) or to lower it inreturn for tariff concessions from other countries&quot; .The decision that the Cabinet had to take involved a choice of risks:    a possible break-up of the NationalCabinet, or doing nothing at all on these lines.   Hethought it would be almost a disaster if, at this early stage, resignations took place which brought the Cabinetto a two-Party basis.   He did not particularly likethese proposals, but he was overwhelmingly impressed by the risk.of having to say that the National Governmenthad broken up before the country had beer; put on its legs.
That was the greater- risk.    Science, he pointed out,only advanced by experiment.   He thought that theproposals of the Report were a risky experiment, but less risky than the other he had mentioned.    On thewhole,  therefore, and without having yet heard the fullarguments, he was prepared to try the experiment.    Ifit failed after due trial he would be prepared to go back.    That was why he drew attention to (m).    It was true that, strictly speaking,  (m) only applied to the selective surtaxes, but he thought it should apply tothe flat rate tariff.    He thought the proposals wouldinvolve some rise in the cost of living.    In some industries wages would automatically rise with the costof living increase, but some parts of the community would suffer, especially those not earning wages.He asked if, in these circumstances, it might not bepossible to make some concession in the UnemploymentBenefit.    If the proposals resulted in a benefit tothe well-to-do classes, such as a reduction in IncomeTax,  it would be most unfortunate politically, and theresxilt would be morally wrong.    Subject to that he was willing to try the proposals contained in the Report.The First Commissioner of Works agreed with theLord Chancellor that action was essential;    otherwise the result would be not/a mere breaking up of the Gabinetbut in the whole Cabinet being swept away by Parliamentif some scheme was not presented for dealing with thebalance of trade by tariffs of an experimental character.They could be justified in the House of Commons by the admission that they were an experiment.   The difficultpoint in dealing with the House of Commons was to explainandwhat was meant by the selective surtaxes,/where theywould be limited.   The public would concentrate on conclusion (m) on page 13 of C.P.-25 (32) and the-3-
selective surtaxes .   fhe first question to be raisedwould be as to whether they would raise the cost ofliving to the poorest of the community.   Meat andcereals were to be exempt from the 10 per cent, flat rate tariff, but not dairy products, which were animportant item in the budget of the poorer classes .Skimmed milk, however, in spite of the objections ofthe farmers, was to be exempt, and this was an especially of the poor.important item in the cost of living figured   Whenpolicy touched food, therefore, it was necessary, incarrying out Conclusion (m), to exercise the greatest care.    As regards manufactures, he pointed out thatthe House of Commons was greatly concerned in ironand steel, and he would, like to hear the conclusionof the President of the Board of Trade as to whether he proposed to deal with these two items under (m).He would also like to know whether there was any plan of action for negotiations with foreign countries.He had always argued on the line that tariff wallswere a real curse to the world and that a tariff wouldigive us  great advantages in dealing with them..   Anopportunity would arise in particular for dealingwith the Argentine and the Scandinavian countries.He had come to the general conclusion, having regardto what had happened at the Election,.to the natureof the present Parliament, and the position of theGovernment, that this was    a   Report which Protection-ists ought to accept.
The Secretary cf State for Scotland deprecated referenceto tho dilemma &quot;between immediate action on the lines of theReport and resignation. The action contemplated in theReport was not the only possibility. Moreover,  theCabinet must be sure that the action was right.     referring to the Lord Chancellor&quot;b suggestion that the experimentwas worth trying, he pointed out that the experiment hadbeon made by other ccuntries and had not succeeded.        Ithad bean tried here in Safeguarding Duties and had notresulted in an increase in exports, which all admittedwas necessary. He could not agree that it was easy toabandon proposals of this kind once they were applied.This was shown by the recent Tariff Conference.       Tariffshad bean deprecated, but nevertheless they had sinceincreasod. Our own experience in the case of theMcKenna Duties pointed to the difficulty of getting rid of tariffs even when a Government wl.th a majority was committed to their repoa]c       In paragraph 43 cf theCommittees report the difficulty was admitted of reducingthe protection afforded to one Industry because a fcroigncountry was ready to make tariff concessions in regard totho products of another. A point that had to be settledwas as to whether Protection was required aa a permanentsystem here or to be used as a weapon to reduce tariffs-abroad.       As the Lord Privy Seal had pointed out in his memorandum and tho Salfeur Committee in their Report on Tradeand Industryq    tho international efforts to get tariffslowered by retaliation had only led to higher tariffs.    if all were in accord on the subject, the best way to accomplisha lowering of tariffs might be to threaten an extension ofthe Abnormal Importations (Customs Duties) Act,  and, if thenegotiations failed, to carry it out as an emergency measure for dealing with the balance of trade.      He felt hesitation in
accepting the estimates that had been given ?f the probablerise in the cost of living.        In any case the effects of theWheat Quota must be added to those estimates,,       He could netagree ts a taxation of feod, even on a low scale.     PoodDuties acted as an inverted super-tax.     At least 60 per Cent,cf the expenditure of the purest classes was on food - suchwas the allowance in the cost of living index of the Ministryof Labour.       He recalled the imputations of cowardice that hadbeen made against those members of the Labour party whe hadebjected to a decrease in the Unemployment Insurance payments by 10 per cent, hut had not objected to a 10 per cent,general tariff. If the present proposals were carried outthe National Government would have adopted both. he recalled that many supporters of the National Governmentwere pledged against fov^d taxes, and this was apart f rcmthe Prime Minister&apos;s own general pledges. He quotedalso pledgee made by certain members of the conservative party during the Election not to tax food.     Consequently he held that all food taxes were indefensible on merits andcontrary to pledges.      They involved an extra imposition ?tithe life i*f the people.     He hoped, therefore., that a safeand more effective policy, consistent with the Governmentspledges, might be found in the Home Secretary1 s proposals.The Secretary of State for Air wished to hear what theChancellor of the Exchequer had to say on tha Memorandum of theLord Privy Seal.       He felt that quotations from speeches at general Elections were not particularly helpful.     He agreed with the Lord Chancellor that it was vital not tq break up theNational Cabinet,     He also agreed that it was essentialthat something must be done. He would like to knew what had been the result of the protection afforded by thodepreciation of the  . He imagined that the relative position of the country was rather better.
He was neither a Protectionist nor a FreeTrader, but he wanted to see tariff walls reduced.Formerly we had been a Free Trade country,  andwe ought to have been able to use our position inthe past to control tariffs, but we had failed to doso.,     If America could be induced to lower tariffs,that would have an effect on the world..     The Committee&apos;splan Involved a tariff wall, and if this was to resultin lowering tariffs it would be all, to the. good.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that; whatimpressed and alarmed him was the question of dates.It was now January 2lst.     Several members of the cabinet would be leaving for Geneva on January 30th. Discussionsmight take some time.    If nothing were done the Houseof Commons would take matters into their own, hands.He thought, however, that the Government could carry the Report if presented as an agreed policy. Otherwisehe feared that the advocates of moderation would beswept away and that a very different Government would come into office, which nobody desired.    He did not say this in order to get what he himself would like, buthe wanted to emphasise that the present House of Commonswas not an easy one to deal with.-The Chancellor of the Exchequer deprecated the dilemma that had been presented between doing nothingand resignation,    No-one had spoken of resignation,,and he did not want the problem approached from that point of view,     He emphasised, however, the FirstLord&apos;s point that immediate action was imperative.The Committee had examined these questions and triedhonestly and sincerely to face them from a national and Imperial point of view.     They had taken the facts,so far as they could ascertain them, and considered the
method of dealing- with the ^ balance of trade.   Theyhad differed to some extent.   The proposals of themajority, however, he pointed out, were not proposals that had previously been put before the country.    Theywere distinctively the Committee&apos;s own proposals andnot pre-determined ideas.      Those who in the past hadadvocated a Protectionist doctrine had given up a gooddeal, and the proposals put forward would not be popularwith all their friends.     They would be accused of weakness.     Prom this point of view he recognised that both sides to the discussion were in a difficult position.He pointed out that the Lord Privy Seal, in his memorandum, had rather suggested that there was noadverse balance of trade.    He had suggested that theMajority Report assumed that the excess of imports was being met either by obtaining them on &quot;tick&quot; orby the drain of capital from this country, and thatthere was no sign of either taking place, and hadquestioned this.     There were signs that Britishcapital abroad was diminishing.      In the end the effects of the transfer of payments abroad must fall on capital.If the   was not  lower it was only fceqa^se we, were&quot;living oh Our fat&quot;.     This only postponed the date ofa serious situation.    If the adverse balance of tradecontinued there must eventually be a depreciation ofthe  ,      In his argument that imports and exportsheld together he thought that the Lord Privy Seal badoverlooked the invisible exports.   His comparison withthe figures of 1929 was fallacious, since the figures were not identical.   The questions of price and volumehad both to be considered.    If reference were made toTable V in CP.-25(32)    where the prices were reducedto the same level, it would be found that exports weredown by about one-third in volume, whereas imports were
practically stationary.      So it was not the case that imports and exports ran exactly together, and there was a bigdifference made up by invisible exports.   The ratio of exports of British produce to retained imports in 1913was 80 per cent, in 1929, 65 per cent, and in the last3 months of 1931, 43 per cent..As regards the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s argument thatthe balance of trade with the Dominions was worse than with foreign countries, he pointed out that this was atemporary difficulty due to the troubles in India and australia.    He pleaded guilty to the Lord Privy Seal&apos;spoint that the same weapon was being used for twoopposite things, e.g. to reduce imports and to induceother1 countries to lower their tariff by lowering our own.The weapon had to be used, however., according to the balanceof advantage, and that was not a reason for rejecting theproposal.     The Lord Privy Seal&apos;s Memorandum, he pointedout.,  involved a period of inaction, and in his view action was essential.     He had been asked as to whether Conclusion(m) was to be used in respect of iron and steel.    it certainly was his Idea that the tariff should be used as a means of securing the re-organisation of the iron and steelIndustry.   The proposals of the Report would providethe means of putting on the necessary pressure.     the argument was &quot;You want Government help, but you must first put your house in order&quot;.    In reply to thequestion as to whether it was the intention of theReport that negotiations should be cerried on withother countries, the answer was &quot;Yes&quot;.    He thought theSecretary of State for Scotland was unduly pessimisticas to the results of such negotiations.     several countries already were anxious to discuss the matter with us,   Denmark, for instance, who was dependent onour market and only bought a small part of her
requirements of manufactured articles here, was an example.    He saw no difficulty in securing agreementwith them by a lowering of the tariff in their favour.It did not mean a lowering of their own tariff wall,but a private entrance for ours elves.    He regarded theproposals in paragraph 7 for a flat rate revenue tariffand selective surtaxes as a single whole, not to be separated.   The Home Secretary, he pointed out, wishedto separate them and trust only to the selectivesurtaxes .      He had known of many general statements ofpolicy in the House of Commons which had collapsedbecause they contained nothing solid.    To go to theHouse of Commons with vague ideas would be to courtdisaster.    Referring to the Home Secretary&apos;s suggestionthat economists  ought to have been consulted, he pointedout that the result of the Home Secretary&apos;s enquiriesseemed to be that they did not agree among themselves .As regards the flat rate of 10 per cent, he pointedout that this was very much in line with one school of thought in Europe.    The suggestion had been made thatit would facilitate out getting into line with holland and Scandinavia and some other countries.   The idea was somewhat vague, but it would help us to link up with countries on the basis of a common idea on generaltariffs,   ^he basis of the proposition was not to reduceimports by attacking particular commodities, but byspreading them over a wide field.   Although certain items had been excluded in the Committee&apos;s Report,they were not intended to be an exhaustive list, and ifthe plan was accepted as a whole the possible extensionWould be examined.   He agreed that the cumulative effectof the Government&apos;s measures on the cost of livingmust be carefully watched.   He had not before heard ofthe Ministry of Labour figures, but an independent
examination in the Treasury had indicated&quot;the R.T.-noising -in these proposals would bring us near to the dangerpoint.   Referring to the selective surtaxes, he gathered that the Lord Privy Seal disliked them butthat the Home Secretary did not object to them so much.They would give us a strong lever for negotiating withforeign Powers and with the Dominions, the possibilityof assistance to Colonies, and a means of enforcingre-organisation on industry.The Home Secretary said that there were tvno points on which all were agreed.     First, that immediate action was necessary.     When they met the House of Commonsthey must present them not with vague statements but with specific proposals, to be followed immediately by the introduction of Bills.   Consequently his own proposals, if brought to the House of Commons, shouldnot be vague, but would have to be worked out in detail.If the Cabinet approved them the next point would be toconsider how to apply them.   He did not wish tQ engage inthe discussion in terms of resignation.   That was why he himself had put forward proposals, which he hoped wouldbe acceptable.     He recalled that not so long ago theChancellor of the Exchequer himself had rejected a 10 percent, tariff.   As regards the attitude of the House ofCommons he recalled that a very large number of Members werepledged to support the National Government whose duty was tobe to consider economic policy and to adopt what was beston the merits of the case.     The country looked to theNational Government to exercise their judgment and toproduce the best result.      The Minister of labour&apos;a remarkson the cost of living had introduced a new factor, but he urged that the Minister of Labour should take into accountalso the effect of a wheat quota and, in addition, the10 per- cent, increase in    /
the cost -of imports allowed for in paragraph 18 of-25 (32).    One aspect of the economic effect ofthe proposals of the majority of the Committee, onwhich nothing had yet been said, was their effect onthe cost of material and. manufacture.    Even though theprincipal raw materials were exempt from the 10 percent, ad valorem Duty, there would remain the partly-manufactured articles,-which formed the raw material ofmany industries,which would not be exempt.   The costof manufacture was hardly less important than the costof living.    A great part of our manufactures ,would behandicapped by this new tariff of 10 per cent.    Hethought that that would be impossible to defend, inthe country.(At, this point- the Cabinet adjourned for lunch, resuming ,at 3 p.m.)mhe Home Secretary resumed by repeating the pointhe had made just before the adjournment as to the serious effect of a 10 per cent, tariff on partially manufacturedraw materials.   When the question was asked as to whythese materials must be taxed the answer was that itwas necessary for the balance of trade to cut off 50,000,000 of   imports. -He submitted, however,that the facts were not as stated in the Report.    Inthis connection he called attention to the following extract from his Memorandum (CP.-32 (32)).:-&quot;In paragraph 18 an assumption is made that the depreciation of sterling will-raise the cost of our imports this yearby 10 per cent.    For this reason the adverse balance of trade is estimated to be increased by  72,000,000.    ButI cannot find any allowance is made forthe effect, of this increase in a reduc-tion in the volume of imports.    Inparagraph 36 it is estimated that if anall-round tariff of 10 per cent, were tobe imposed it would reduce imports by 46,000,000; but for the effect of anall-round increase of the prices ofimports by the same amount no allowancewhatever is made.&quot;
on making this discovery he had telephoned to theChancellor of the Exchequer, and some alight modifica-tions had been made in paragraph 18 of the Report,but they did not meeV the situation.    The Report statedthat there was an adverse balance of trade of 150,000,000 which was to be met by  100,000,000increase of exports and  50,000,000 reduction in imports.     He submitted, however, that the properfigure for the adverse balance of trade on the basis ofthe Committeetb calculations was  100,000,000.The Homo Secretary drew attention to the point raised in the postscript to his memorandum.   In paragraph18 of the Report it was found necessary to assume that our imports this year would be increased in price by 10 percent, on account of the depreciation of sterling.   Becauseof this, an addition was made to the Committee&apos;s estimateof the adverse balance of trade of  72,000,000.     But therewas no deduction made in respect of the decrease in thequantity of imports that would follow upon their increase .in price by 10 per cent.     The Committee estimated that ifa tariff of 10 per cent, were to be imposed all round(less on   third preference for the Dominions) imports wouldbe reduced by  46,000,000 (page 21, Assumption B).     If no allowance was made for Dominion preference, this would be equivalent to about  50,000,000.     But when an equalincrease of 10 per cent, in price was assumed to take place,not through a tariff but through the depreciation of sterling, no corresponding deduction was made.    Table 4 on.
- J3page 5 showed that it was anticipated that if certainrestrictions were placed on the imports of this year,  theycould be reduced from  774,000,000,  last year&apos;s figure,  to 722,000,000.      The whole of this  52,000,000 of reduction is accounted for by the effect of the restriction,  and no allowance is made for the effect of sterling depreciation.Again in paragraph 18 the Committee say &quot;Having regard tothe optimistic assumption we have used in our calculationsof export trade expansion, we are of opinion that any restriction of imports that may be caused by &quot;sterlingdepreciation&quot; should be regarded as off-setting the probablefailure to realise to the full the estimated expansion of exports&quot;.      If any allowance in the statistics had been madefor contraction from this cause-, why should the oppositebe stated here?There will be three effects following upon the depreciation of sterling,  according to the Committee&apos;sreport - an increase in the cost of imports;    a consequent reduction in the quantity of importsj    an increase of exports.      The first will add to the unfavourable balanceof trade,  the other two will reduce it.      The Committeeinclude  72,000,000 under the first head on the one sideof the account,  but nothing under the second and thirdheads on the other side of the account.      Either the 72,000,000 ought to be omitted on the one side,  or atleast  50,000,000 ought to be deducted on the other.      Ifthe latter were done,  the Committee&apos;s calculations would show an adverse balance, not of about  150,000,000, but ofabout  -100,000,000;    and almost the whole amount of thedeductions aimed at by the process of import restrictions would have been achieved without them.-if-
If in the House of Commons it was shown thatthe adverse balance was not  150,000,000 but  180,000,000the whole basis of the policy would fall to the ground.There would be no adequate statistical foundation.    the answer might perhaps be given that we could not evenmake up an adverse balance of  100,000,000 by expandingexports.      That might be so, but it was a different basis of argument, and the basis could not be changedowing to a statistical error in the Report.     Therewere four factors that had to be taken into considera-tion:- (l)    The rise in the cost of imports by10 per cent.(2)    A consequential restriction ofimports.(3)    The increased sterling price of exports.(4)    An expansion in the quantity of exportsdue to the depreciation of the  .In the case of (l) the Committee had allowed anadditional  72,000,000:    for (2) no allowance hadbeen included, but it should have been  50,000,000.(3) and (4) were so uncertain that the Committee had made no allowance for them.     The Report allowed for the  72,000,000 and not for the other three factors.     Consequently the figure of  150,000,000could not be accepted.      He submitted that on the merits of the balance of trade the case for the policycontained in the Report was not proved.      If he were told that the policy was necessary for purposes ofrevenue he would have to ask what was the Budgetposition?     Would there be a deficit?     Was this thebest way to meet it?     Or were there not other ways?
If this was the line to be taken, the Cabinet should approach it as though they were discussing a Budget,Referring to the suggestion that the   -experimentshould be tried, he agreed with those who claimed that it would not be a new experiment.     Further, itwould not be possible to withdraw the tariffs, onceimposed:    they must be permanent.     They would becomelinked up with the Budget and could not be withdrawnunless replaced by other taxation  - a most difficult matter.     Though not avowedly imposed as a protectivesystem, the tariff would act in the same manner.      Itwould protect agriculture and manufactures, and politi-cally it would be most difficult to get rid of it.Furthermore, it would be tied up with bargains   withthe Dominions.      Consequently the 10 per cent, flat rate tariff would, from its nature, become a permanenttax.     Those were the reasons why he could not accept thepresent proposal.     He agreed with those who said theGovernment should come forward without a definite policy.      He thought, however, that if they came forward with a national policy such as he had suggested andwithout a 10 per cent, flat rate tariff and explained the reasons, the House of Commons would accept.    Mostof its Members were pledged to support what theGovernment proposed.     Of course if the House of Commonsdefeated the proposals a new situation would arise.The President of the Board of Trade replied to the statistical point raised by the Home Secretary.He had at once referred it to Sir Sydney Chapman&apos;aCommittee-, of which Sir Horace Wilson, Sir HoraceHamilton and Mr. Flux were members.     He had asked for
their explanation and they had handed in the followingwritten reply, which the President of the Board ofTrade read to the Cabinet:-&quot;It is, of course, the case that anincrease in the prices of imports tends to reduce the volume of consumption ofthose imports.   This was not overlookedeither by the Chapman Committee or by theMain Report of the Balance of Trade Com-mittee.    In fact the figure of  214 m.,to which  72 m. were added in respect ofthe effect of depreciation in increasingimport prices had. already postulated areduction of imports resulting from either restrictions or depreciation.The effect of para.18 is to suggest thatan attempt should be made to effect thewhole reduction in imports, i.e.,  52 m.,involved in attaining the figure of 214 m. (or  286 m. allowing for theeffect of depreciation upon import prices)by restrictions and that no allowance should be made for any effect of higher prices due to depreciation.    If such afurther reduction in imports takes place,the gain thereby accruing should be offsetagainst the probable failure to increaseexports, by the desired figure.&quot;Paragraph 18 of the Committee^ Report had been amendedat their suggestion.    In these circumstances it mustbe assumed that the figures were correct and that theHome Secretary&apos;s statements v;ere not well founded,A further discussion took place on thesefigures, in which the Home Secretary and the Presidentof the Board of trade took part.The President of the Board of Trade explainedthat he was not sanguine about the suggested increaseof exports in 1932.The Prime Minister said that was the view of experts of the Economic Advisory Council with whom hehad discussed, it.mhe President of the Board, of Trade said if that were so the case was stronger for adopting themeasures in the Report to deal with the very difficult situation.    If it was not dealt with and if nothing was done to maintain the .  there would be greatgeneralfluctuations and the^tendency in comparison to the
Gold Dollar   would be downwards.    Supposing the.   fell to Dollars 2.50, it would double the price of food-stuffs and raw material and set going the whole vicious spiralof high prices, high wages,  issue of more papercurrency and all the well-known symptoms of inflation.The effect on such industries as cotton and wool wouldbe most serious.    Consequently the Government cannotlet things take their course.    He did not particularlylike to be the joint author of these proposals, but hewas bound to do what he could to co-operate in checkingthese evils. If he was told by the Home Secretary thatthe 10 per cent, flat rate tariff was going to increasethe cost of raw materials, his reply was that this was equally the case with the specific Duties which theHome Secretary supported, and this partial, criticismoverlooked the benefits of the tariff proposal.    Underpressure of events action had to be taken even if  itwas repugnant.    If the policy was adopted he would support it to his utmost in the House of Commons.    Thedifficulty would be to convince our own people of thenecessity without telling too much to the rest of theworld.    He had no doubt, however, that the balance oftrade would come right in the end, but we had not timeto wait and could not stand violent oscillations.   he agreed generally in the constructive proposals of theLord Privy Seal.   He pointed out that if Exchangesfell to the level he had suggested the cost of livingmight easily rise 40 or 50 points.   As regardsnegotiations with other countries, if the Cabinetdesired, he or some other member ought to get into
touch with them soon and not to lose thepresent opportunity while the atmospherewas favourable.    He thought the 10 per cent,basis would be very useful.   He agreed inthe Lord Privy Seal1s suggestions as tothe desirability of stopping all Reparationsand War Debts payments.    In his view the cessation of these vras an essential stage in getting international trade going.    he agreed with him also as to the maldistribu-tion of gold.    He could not say whether a6 per cent. Bank Rate was necessary, buthe knew that commercial men had strongviews as to the burden of the high bank rate.    As regards the re-organisation ofIndustry he also agreed with the lord privy Seal, but he was not sanguine asto the prospects.    It was very difficultto get the trades working together, buthe thought a scheme on the lines of theMajority Report would be a great help.-19-
After some further discussion on the Home SecretaryYsdoubts as to the statistical basis of the Committee&apos;s report-The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that thereport did not depend on the exact accuracy of the figures.Even if the balance of trade could be shown to be levelthe position would be unsatisfactory as compared with the favourable balances of past years.      Even in such a casesteps ought to be taken to rectify the situation.The President ef the Board of Education pointed outthat all were agreed that, in order to rectify the balanceof trade,  it was vital to increase exports.     Ho couldnot understand how a tariff of 10fo on the greater part ofthe raw materials was going to cheapen exports.     He couldnot see how these proposals could benefit either the  sterling or the trade of the country.The Lord Privy Seal agreed with the Chancellor of theExchequer that the question would not be determined bythe exact accuracy of the figures.      There was inevitablya good deal of conjecture an the statistical side andthe subject of the balance of trade was wrapped inobscurity with many uncertain factors.     What the cabinet had to consider was whether the proposals would have afavourable effect on the trade situation.      His own view was that this was not proved.      It had never been contestedthat taxes on semi-raw material would affect exportsadversely.      Everyone agreed also that an expansion of exports was necessary, and the proposals of the committee did not produce that.      He did not share the Presidentof the Board of Trade&apos;s pessimism as to the future of the  sterling.      If a run on the   was likely it would already have taken place, whereas its value had become roughlystabilised at about 5  dollars.      This did not supportthe idea of a slump to 2^- dollars.      If that occurred it
would indicate that something was seriously wrong and wouldhave to be dealt with.     His own Memorandum had encountereda less effective criticism than he had expected.      Muchof it stood unchallenged.      He agreed with the Lord Chancellorthat, when the Government met Parliament,  it would have toput forward proposals.      The Conservative, members ofthe Cabinet were a better judge.than he as to whether theproposals in the majority report would prove satisfactory, buthe himself had doubts.     But for Conservative Members,  theseproposals at least involved no sacrifice of principle.      Forsome other Members of the Cabinet the position was very different.      He recognised the difficulties of his Conservativecolleagues, who had to meet a strong demand for tariffs.      he expressed doubts as to the Chancellor of the Exchequerfsapprehensions that capital was draining away from thiscountry and gave a recent instance when considerable capital movements back to this country had been reported.      One pointin his Memorandum which had not been answered was the correspondence between exports and imports, which could notbe gainsaid.      A fall of imports was invariably followed bya fall in exports.     Even the &quot;Buy British&quot;  campaign had probably had this effect.      The crux of the whole questiontwas whether the proposals would do good or not.     Hethought that they would not.      He looked forward with interestto the Minister of Labour&apos;s Memorandum, but his figuresappeared to be calculated on a very narrow basis of commodities.      He thought that the 10^5 tax on imports wouldhave become a 15^ increase on the cost of living after the&apos;goods had passed through the-various middlemen to thVconsumer.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs deprecatedattaching too much importance to the statistical basis ofthe report.      The arguments used in the report were basedrather on principle.     K.e himself was not unmindful of the
effect of an increase in the cost of living, but attachedeven more importance to the prospect of increased employment.All were agreed that the Government must meet parliament with definite proposals.     Everyone agreed with the lord privy Seal&apos;s proposals for settling debts and reparations,but, after the difficulties with the French over the relatively minor question of the Lausanne Conference, aGovernment that had nothing better to offer would be laughedout of court.      Everyone agreed also with the Home secretary that industry should be reorganised.      But the late government had worked at it for two years without very muchresult, and it was no easier to-day.      It was not onlya long job, but. when the Government tried to put pressure onan industry the first question would be &quot;How much protectionwill you give us?&quot;      In this matter the Committee&apos;s plan was the best.      He did not want to offend anyone&apos;sprinciples, but, judging from the recent election, publicopinion - to put it mildly - would not be shocked by theCommittee&apos;s proposals.      Experience had shown that it wasuseless to try and induce foreigners to reduce tariffsmerely by talking to them.     The only way was to persuade them that we meant business, as the Committee propose.     Hecould not agree that the report was not a compromise,although the subject had not been discussed in a bargainingspirit, but with a sincere desire to be fair to all and todo the best for the nation.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs confirmed the.latter statement.     On the general situation the cruxwas the Parliamentary position.     Admittedly this topic hadbeen raised in an urgent situation requiring concrete,immediate action.     He could understand the arguments infavour of long-range action, and he had a certain respect forthe theories behind them.     But the immediate need, was tomeet the Parliamentary situation by action..     Whatever plan
was produced must be a compromise solution.     The whole country expected a solution designed to keep the Governmenttogether.     As regards the Committee&apos;s proposals, he didnot claim the technical authority of the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer or President of the Board of Trade, but hehad recently given some study to the question, and some of -his preconceived ideas had received a shock.     He did notbelieve that the connection between imports and exports couldbe sustained on any close mathematical basis.      Were it so the logical deduction would be that the best way to increaseexports would be to increase imports.      The deep-seatedcauses of our troubles were difficult to discover, and he himself had reached his practical conclusions by processof excluding alternatives.      The Board of Trade believed thatin the past it had been possible to arrive at an approximatebasis of the figures of the balance of trade.     When thebalance had been favourable there had not been these currencytroubles.      When the balance of trade was unfavourable andthese other troubles did arise something had to be done.What could be done?      In the matter of invisible exportsnothing the Government could do could produce much effect.       jNeither could they be sure of increasing exports.      The onlystep open was to control imports.     When imports wereexceeding exports to the tune of over  2,000,000 a week theCabinet had to do something besides long-range action.Prohibition of imports had been suggested, but - though there were also difficulties from other points of view - from ;that of balance of trade prohibition was as bad as a tax.Did experience show that it was beyond the wit of man tocontrol imports without reducing exports?     The Germanscontrolled imports and yet had a favourable trade balance.(The Lord Privy Seal remarked that they had to export without ;payment.)     Even in our own case, although he had himself
criticised, the McKenna duties, he was impressed by the exports of motor cars.      It had been said that the case for the report had not been proved.     But the Government hadto consider some immediate treatment of the problem.If the proposed solution was a silly one he would not agree to it.     Referring to the long-term proposals he pointed out that there was nothing antagonistic to themin the Committee&apos;s report.      The Lord Privy Seal urged the economic importance of disarmament.     As one concernedin the international side of both disarmament andreparation, he could say that the difficulties of theformer were by far the greater.      So he did not believe it possible that the Cabinet could limit themselves to long-range proposals.     Had anyone, he asked, any alternative proposals for immediate action?The Home Secretary drew attention to paragraph 4. ofhis Memorandum (CP.  52 (?2))  in which he had suggestedlegislation to replace the Abnormal Importations .Act,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs took note of this.     He understood that apart from this the HomeSecretary limited himself to the second half of theCommittee&apos;s proposal, which was. much less than the whole.In conclusion he thought it would be a great disservice toproclain that a compromise could not.be reached.     TheCommittee^ plan was a compromise.     Wheat and meat hadbeen given up by those who advocated protection,  to he took the view that something on the lines of the majority report must be adopted and defended in Parliament.
The Minister of Health, referring to sugges-tions that the  . sterling should he left to look after itself, remarked that the present position wasnot without precedent.      Previous experience showed that in a large country with a highly developedeconomic organisation what was likely to happen withsuch an adverse balance as ours was not that the  .would balance exports and imports by slow movements,but that there would be a gradual fall to a dangerpoint, at which there would be a catastrophic fall,with far more serious consequences to the cost ofliving than those attending a tariff.      It had been said that the  . was now fairly stable.     He couldnot agree.      Three forces were maintaining it - first,,reputation, traditional confidence, which had evenmaintained the mark for a time.      Even this waglargely due to the belief that something was going tobe done.      Second, there were our foreign assets,which acted as a buffer against the pressure ofadverse balance.      These assets, be believed, were either wasting or being mortgaged.      The latter methodof diminution was difficult to detect.      Third, therewas the paralysis of international trade, whichrestricted purchases, and artificial restriction ofthe exchange market, which concealed its real state.When world trade revived, this would no longer operate.These three factors all tended to counteract theeffects of the adverse balance of trade, but were all
1 1 9-a- -a. twtemporary.     What would happen when their effect wasexhausted?     He shared the apprehensions of thePresident of the Board of Trade unless we could res-trict imports and increase exports.      The theory thatthere was an inseparable connection between the volumeof exports and imports might be true for long periodsand normal times.      It was not true under our presentconditions3 of an adverse balance of imports paid forout of capital.The Home Secretary hoped the Cabinet would notassume that the critics of the majority report were infavour only of long-range policies.    In paragraph 4 ofhis Memorandum he had proposed immediate legislationalong lines similar to those of the Abnormal Importa-tions Act.     He had put that forward as a compromise.As regards the proposed flat rate tariff of 10%, he pointed out that the proposal would impose taxationtipon  1682000,000 of foodstuffs in order to lessen our imports by  11,000,000, and upon  177,000,000 of&quot;Articles wholly or Mainly Manufactured&quot; in order to exclude  20,000,000.     There might in addition bearguments from the point of view of revenue, but inthat event this was not the right way to present the&quot;proposal.The Lord President of the Council said thatall the arguments for and against tariffs had beenfamiliar to most of his colleagues for thirty years,so he would confine himself to a few observations as leader of the largest political/
party in the House of Commons.      The suggestion that therehad been &quot;no sacrifice&quot; came from Members of other political parties.      History v/ould say that the Conservative party had contributed in sacrifice in the formation of theNational Party.      He had been struck by the growth of ateam spirit in the House of Commons, which had been wellillustrated by the Debate on the results of the IndiaRound Table Conference.      The Lord Privy Seal hadhinted that the reception of the Committee&apos;s proposals bythe House of Commons might not be too favourable.      Butseven out of nine Members of the Committee had supportedthem.      If the Cabinet advocated them in the House ofCommons they would be adopted.      He thought that thearguments of the President of the Board of Trade and theMinister of Health on the position of the   sterling wereunanswerable.      He recalled that in the time of the firstNational Government the Home Secretary had said &quot;Let ushold together until the fate of the   is settled&quot;.      now the settlement of its fate was likely to take a long time,but he thought they should try and hold together.      Thetariff was the only question which divided the Cabinet.In thinking this difficulty over in the Christmas vacationit had occurred to him,  though he had always desired acomplete tariff system,  that it might be possible to uniteon a level duty.      Such a general duty had in the past been less repugnant to those who held free trade principles the duty and/need not be too high.      It had interested him when heheard that the Committee was turning in that direction.He was interested also in the importance attached by theCommittee to improvement of industry.   - In two or threeindustries he believed that progress could only be made bythe method proposed.     The taking of power to remove orreduce a tariff also appealed to him.     For bargaining with
Foreign Countries and for dealing-with raw materials a TariffCommission or Advisory Committee would, he thought, benecessary.     Raw materials might be difficult to define,but, as he had once said in the House of Commons, &quot;theyare    like a gentleman, hard to describe, but you know himwhen you see him&quot;.     He differed from the Secretary ofState for Scotland&apos;s views in thinking that it was nouse bargaining with foreign countries on the basis ofa mere threat.     A low duty was, in his opinion, a tremendous weapon.      It would enable us to ally ourselves with other low tariff countries, and to show high tariffcountries that we could meet them.      In reply to aquestion interjected by the Lord Privy Seal, as to why,if the tariff weapon was a useful one, it had not been appliedsuccessfully by other countries, he made the observationthat our free trade system had been the buttress of highprotection abroad.     Turning to the situation in the house the General election of Commons,  it was necessary to do something.     /    had,as the Lord Privy Seal had prophesied, developed into a tariff election.      The whole country expected something tobe done.      The Cabinet would not survive inaction.      he believed the proposals of the majority report would beaccepted, and he himself was prepared to support and defendthem in the country and in Parliament.      He had neverpretended to like coalitions, but he had believed theNational Government to be a national necessity, and had entered it with the intention of giving it all support.He would regret its collapse as keenly as that of a conservative Government,The Prime Minister said that his position was thathe had been drawn to reconsideration of a policy which he believed to be sound under normal international conditions.At present the country was faced with an emergency situation,and the Governments action had to be adapted accordingly.
All agreed that something had to be done.      It was not sufficient to talk of tendencies that were favourable,nor to say that the Government were working away atthe question of reparations and war debts - though no government could say it with greater force.     He wouldnot go over the features of the problem, as he believedall were agreed on that.      There was also agreement asto what would happen if some Government did mot find some means of protecting the   sterlings     The present proposal was for a flat rate tariff and a selectivetariff.     He did not much like the first.     There was great force in the Home Secretary&apos;s criticisms.     a flat rate tariff was bound to become permanent.     Butthe competition we had to face was different, andconducted with different weapons from those of thelatter half of the last century.      The War had changednot only the map, but also the economic mentality ofEurope.     So he was prepared in these exceptional circumstances to face a tariff;    but on conditions.First it must not affect the cost of living so. far asto bring it within the vicious spiral.      Second itmust do as little damage as possible to the cost ofproduction.      There must be vigilance to see that it did not make producers and manufacturers lazy.      Hehad formed unfavourable impressions of certainmanufacturers who had been unwilling to reorganise theirindustry, owing to their expectation that a generalelection would give them a tariff and enable them toavoid reorganisation.      It would be necessary to ensurethat efficiency went, with enjoyment of benefit.      ifsomething could also be done with labour it would bevery advantageous, though very difficult.      This should
be kept in mind. ,   Third, whatever was done in the wayof a tariff must not reduce efforts towards reducingtariffs generally.     A healthy nation might haveto reduce imports to balance trade, but the index ofhealth was its exports.On the whole,  the Report conformed to these threetests.      So he was willing to support it as a generalpolicy.      If adopted in principle by the Cabinet itwould be further examined as to whether modification in detail was required as a result of the discussion.Once the policy was announced legislation wouldhave to be passed straight away with protection against forestalling.      Secrecy would be vital.      Ifthe Minister of Labour&apos;s report on cost of livingrendered it necessary, modification could be made.The Home Secretary said he personally could not support the measure proposed.      It had not been shown to be necessary,  and was in some respects deleterious.It was not a compromise proposal, but carried out thefull protectionist programme, a Quota replacing a WheatDuty,      The policy included an all-round tariff anda fighting tariff, with high specific duties.     Hecould not find in this a beginning of a compromise.The Lord Privy Seal,  the President of the Board ofEducation and the Secretary of State for Scotlandsup &quot;ported the Home Secretary.The Prime Minister .said that all present wouldhave to face- what would be the result of a break-up ofthe National Government.      He then adjourned the meetinguntil 10.J0 a.m. on the following day.Whi teha 11 Gardens , S. W. 1.21 st January, 1932.
