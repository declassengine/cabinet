(jtflNA and japan.Events at shangai.[Previous&quot;Reference:Cabinet 14(52), Con-clusion 1.)1* In the absence of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, the Lord President of the Councilasked the Secretary of State for War if he had any information to communicate in connection withthe Shanghai affair.The Secretary of State for War said that he had  -received a telegram giving the latest militarypositions.    For the moment the Japanese appearedto be held up;    further reinforcements were expected.He called attention to telegrams that had been circulated containing various protests to theJapanese authorities .   He also read a telegram that-had been received from the China Association in shanghai, which contained a confidential passagecommenting adversely on the anti-Japanese sentimentas expressed in certain British newspapers and inthe communications of the Council of the League ofNations to Japan.    These, according to this communi-cation, tended to stiffen the Chinese and to prolongthe trouble, and indicated a misunderstanding ofthe situation.The attention of the Cabinet was called to thefrequent occasions on which the Japanese assurancesas to non-interference with the Settlement, thenumbers of troops to be despatched, and so forth,had been disregarded, and it was suggested that every possible effort should be made to preventshells from falling into the Settlement.    In thisconnection attention was drawn to a telegram fromthe British Ambassador at Tokyo (No ,127 of February24th) suggesting that a friendly talk between naval officers at Shanghai might result in the removaldownstream of the Japanese Flagship, which was a target for Chinese shells and was at present locatedclose to the British Consulate-General.

In the absence of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, who had asked that this question might be placed on the Agenda Paper of the Cabinet,no detailed discussion was possible.   The Gabinetwere given to understand, however, that the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs felt that beforeaccepting the invitation to participate in theInternational Conference proposed by the netherlands government, His Majesty&apos;s Government ought to reach some more definite decision as to their policy onthis question.The First Lord of the Admiralty informed theCabinet that he had received a very interestingreport on the subject from the Captain of a FisheriesProtection Vessel, which he would circulate.After a short discussion the Cabinet agreed  -That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows -The Minister of Health (in the Chair),The Home Secretary,The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The Secretary of State for Scotland,The First Lord of the Admiralty,The Minister of Agriculture andFisheries,The First Commissioner of Works -should examine the question andreport to the Cabinet.(NOTE:    It was arranged that themeeting should not takeplace until the return ofthe First Lord of theAdmiralty from Geneva.)
JUDGES&apos; 7.   The Cabinet took note of the followingSALARIES.Question to be put in the House of Commons,together with the answer, on thet of Judges&apos; salaries :-Question.    To ask the Prime minister whether the course taken under the economy Act and Order in Council in reference to the Judges has notimpaired the independence of the judges and the position they have occupied in the Constitution sincethe passing, of the Act of Settlement;and whether his attention has been called to the grave doubts which areentertained by eminent jurists as towhether the above Act and Order havelegally affected the Judges?Answer. The House is aware thatdoubts have been expressed byeminent jurists whether the EconomyAct, and the Order in Council madeunder it, were legally applicableto the Supreme Court Judges.   the judges themselves, while they were all of them ready to share the burdens that have been undertaken by the whole nation at the presenttime, were gravely concerned lest the Constitutional status of theiroffice should have been in any wayimpaired.I am glad to take this opportunity of repeating the assurance, already conveyed tothe Judges, that nothing has been further from the intention of theGovernment than to derogate in anyway from the special position inwhich His Majesty&apos;s Judges standby virtue of the Act of Settlement,the Act of I George III and laterStatutes,  or to effect, directly or indirectly, the independence, security or prestige of their high office.The Lord President of the Council paid a tribute to the assistance he had received fromthe Master of the Rolls, and the Lord Chancellorthanked the Lord President of the Council for hisgood offices, which had been largely instrumentalin the present settlement.(previous reference:Cabinet 14 subject(38), Con-clusion 3.)
rB WASK1N&amp;T0NQVRS COWVEW-ION.previous reference:Cabinet 22(29), Gon-clxision 5.)f R8. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Minister of Labour (CP.-79 (32)) on thesubject of the attitude to be adopted by theGovernment towards the Washington Hours Convention.After discussing the various alternatives theMinister of Labour recommended that the safest, &quot;most consistent and most straightforward course was to say, in the first place,  that we are notprepared to go on with the Hours Bill of 1930, and go on to say that in the Government&apos;s,opinion theWashington Convention itself is inadequate for thepurpose for which it was designed.   After recallingthe attitude of previous Governments and the reject-tion of their efforts by the International LabourOrganisation, it should be added that the UnitedKingdom now feels that the next move must comefrom some other quarter.   He would further statethat if any other Government or either of theindustrial groups have proposals to make forfurthering International regulation of hours ofwork in industry, they would naturally be consideredhere with close attention:    but in his view itshould be made clear to everyone concerned thatit is useless to expect the present Government,particularly at this stage, to embark once moreupon the thankless task of trying to secure anysubstantial amount of real agreement internationallyon this topic.The Minister of Labour read an extract from aletter he had received from the Prime Minister onthis question and asked that the subject might be adjourned for a week or two to enable him toconsider the matter further and submit a freshMemorandum in the light of the Prime Ministerssuggestions .
A short discussion took place, at the close ofwhich the lord President,  in adjourning the question as requested by the Minister of Labour, asked himto circulate a fuller Memorandum on the wholequestion, explaining for the information of theCabinet what the main difficulties were in theacceptance of the Washington Hours Convention and setting forth the heads of the United KingdomGovernment&apos;s case on the subject.
9.   The subject of the International convention on Hours of Work in Commerce and Offices, on whichthe Minister of Labour haffl circulated a Memorandum(C.P.-80 (32)) was adjourned, as it was consideredadvisable to deal with it at the same time as thequestion of the Washington Hours Convention.
AYM3NT 10.- The Chancellor of the Exchequer made a shortCREDITS.statement to the Cabinet on certain aspects of therevious credits that had been received from abroad in connectioneference:Cabinet Go with the effort to maintain the gold standard.    The(51), Appendix.)Chancellor&apos;s statement was commented on as disclosinga remarkably satisfactory position.      It was suggested to the Chancellor of the Exchequer that in anyannouncements on this subject he should try and remove the prevailing public impression that the  80 millioncredit obtained from New York and Paris representedexpenditure actually incurred and imposed on the taxpayer.. The Lord President thanked the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer for his statement.
