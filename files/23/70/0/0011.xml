1.   The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that the latest information as to the trouble between China and Japan was grave, whetherconsidered from the point of view of matters   , of fact or questions of opinion.    On matters     of facthe had received a telegram from Shanghai (No.19,of February 3rd) stating that Japanese Destroyers;passing Woosung forts were fired on by the latterand the fire had been returned, and that in conse-quence the Japanese -intended to occupy Woosung, atthe entrance to the Whangpoo River.    There was some evidence also that the Japanese were intending to move troops to China and probably to Shanghai.On the previous afternoon the First Secretary tothe Japanese Embassy had visited the Foreign Officeand informed him that, as the Japanese residents in shanghai were constantly being fired on, they wouldhave to move in troops for their protection.   he himself had replied by making strong representationsas to the inexpediency of this step,   , and had made it clear that the proper course was to allow the International Force to keep the peace in shanghai.Turning to matters of opinion, the foreign secretary said he had received a telegram from theBritish Ambassador at Tokio (No ,59) stating thatthe position was now so delicate that a singlefalse step might precipitate a catastrophe.   the ambassador trusted, therefore, that no further action would be taken at Geneva or elsewhere untilthe result of the recent representations was known, jOn receipt of this, the Foreign Secretary had telegraphed to the Ambassador asking him to explain
what the phrase &quot;precipitate a catastrophe&quot; implied.At the same time he had sent a message to theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs, in whichhe had associated the Prime Minister with himself,asking for his assistance In avoiding action atGeneva until he had further information from ^okio.The Secretary of State then drew attention to atelegram from Tokio (No.56) forwarding a request from the Japanese military authorities for british assistance in the evacuation of the Japanese Consulateand colony, numbering about 50 persons in all fromSuchow, a place on the Yangtse some sixty miles from shanghai.   He was strongly inclined to instruct the consul-General at Shanghai that we ought to do anything possible to help in this matter.The Foreign Secretary said he had spoken on the telephone on the previous evening to Mr Stimson,who had been much more cheerful, partly owing tothe announcement in the Press of certain changesin Japanese naval appointments,  including theappointment to command at Shanghai of Admiral Nomura,who was reported to be well known to, and trusted by,.American Naval Officers.    Mr Stimson had also expressed satisfaction at the appointment of PrinceFushimi as Chief of the Japanese Naval GeneralStaff.As regards the Five Points, the acceptance ofwhich had been pressed on the Chinese and Japanese-Governments (telegram No.5 to Nanking and No.35 toTokio, dated February 1st), a preliminary reply from Tokio indicated that the first four pointsappeared to the Foreign Minister personallyacceptable but he desired to consult his colleaguesbefore his final reply.   The fifth point was
unacceptable,  on the ground that it had nothing to do with the Shanghai incident and in any caseJapanesethe^Government adhered to their objections toobservers at negotiations (Tokio telegram No.55) .Mr Stimson was disposed to stand firm on the FivePoints, but saw considerable advantage in Japan&apos;acceptance of the first four.   The main difficulty that was likely to arise was in applying the first four points on the ground at Shanghai, wherefighting was frequent.The Prime Minister thought that.the meeting ofthe Council of the League at Geneva on the previous day had produced a good effect, more especially inmaking clear that the United Kingdom, France, Italyand the United States of America were pursuing thesame policy.    He informed the Cabinet that he had held frequent conferences during the last few dayswith the Lord President of the Council, the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs and the Ministers atthe head of the three Service Departments, to dealwith matters requiring immediate action.The Secretary of State for War read a SituationReport from Shanghai, timed 9 a.m., reporting thatafter the fighting on the previous day firing haddied down and that no progress had been made bythe Japanese.    The remainder of the perimeter wasquiet.    By Saturday the Commander, Shanghai Are*a^would have 10,000 international,troops under his control and considered that with this force thesecurity of the Settlement, other than (the Japanese)Sector A, would be assured.After some further discussion, the cabinet agreed
(a) To accept the report of theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs:(h) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should giveParliament as much informationas possible, but should make itclear that the uncertainty inthe situation, which had,rendereda Debate inadvisable on the pre-vious day, still persisted:(c) That the Secretary of State shouldhave full discretion to inform the speaker and. the Leader of theOpposition,  if he thought advisable,as to the actual facts of thesituation:(d) To take note that the ministers concerned would meet as necessaryto deal with any urgent situation&apos;.(e) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should have authority to take such action as he deemed advisable to co-operate in the withdrawal of theJapanese Consulate and colonyfrom Suchow,
IMPORT DUTIESBILL.Treatment ofthe Dominionsunder.(previous reference:Cabinet 10(32), Con-clusion 2 .)a.2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer raised as amatter of urgency the question of the manner inwhich Preference to the Dominions and India wasto be dealt with in the Import Duties Bill pendingthe Ottawa Conference.   Under the provisions of clause 4 of the Bill, as at present drafted, theDuty of 10 per cent, would be applied to theDominions pending the Ottawa Conference, but power would be taken to remit or reduce the rate chargeablein the event of some agreement being reached at ottawa.    This plan had been adopted in order toassist the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,who desired to be in a strong position at the ottawa Conference for the conduct of his negotia-tions..   The Chancellor of the Exchequer, who had always had some misgivings, as to the effect thisprovision was likely to have on the atmosphere ofthe Ottawa Conference, had recently consulted the .Lord President of the Council, who was acting forthe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs in theabsence of the latter at Geneva.    As a result hehad consulted the High Commissioner for Canada onthe question.    The latter, when he first saw him.,had confirmed his worst fears .   The High Commissionerwas being bombarded by Chambers of Commerce, etc..He had also received a telephone message fromthe Prime Minister of the Dominion, who was muchperturbed and had gone so far as to suggest thatif the Press reports were correct as to what was intended it would be no use to hold a Conferenceat Ottawa at all..   After consulting his cabinet mr Bennett had sent the High Commissioner a further communication emphasising the disastrous effect
that the course.at present proposed would have onthe Ottawa Conference, recalling that Canada hadrefrained from increasing the tariff on british goods last year and proposed to refrain again thisyear,    &quot;&quot;he Chancellor gathered that the course which commended itself to the Prime Minister ofCanada was that a tariff of general application,including the Dominions, should be announced but should not be applied to the Dominions until afterthe Ottawa Conference.   He was inclined to support this solution.The Cabinet felt the greatest reluctance atbeing obliged to discuss a question of this naturein the absence of the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs, more especially as he was knownto hold strong views \upon it&apos;    but, in view of theStatement to be made by the Chancellor of theExchequer in Parliament on the following, day, they felt that an early decision was required on thenew factors reported by the Chancellor of theExchequer.In the course of the discussion it was pointedout that the proposed solution wras itself open tosome objections.    Supposing, for example, no agreement were reached at Ottawa,  it would be extremely difficult to impose a tariff of 10 percent, on Dominions produce after&apos; it had been heldin abeyance.   An alternative course, which perhapswas more likely to be adopted in such a contin-geney, would be to allow a Dominions preference of one-third, as had been originally suggested bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer..The Cabinet were informed that some of their colleagues had learned by telephone from Geneva
that morning that if the proposal contained inthe Bill could not be adhered to, the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs would prefer that provision should be made in the Import DutiesBill for a Dominions Preference of one-third,pending the Ottawa Conference.,On the whole, the general opinion of the cabinet was that it was  essential to avoid anything calcu-lated to destroy the atmosphere of the ottawa conference, and that in the circumstances it wouldbe advisable to adopt the proposal which was understood, to commend itself to the Prime Ministerof Canada, that is to say, to announce the applica-tion of the tariff generally to all countries,including the Dominions, but,  pending the ottawa conference, to exempt the Dominions and India.The Chancellor of the Exchequer left the meeting to discuss the matter on the telephone with theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs at Geneva.On his return he reported that he had conveyed theview of the Cabinet to the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs,    The latter required further timeto consider whether:^&apos; he could accept the Cabinet&apos;opinion,   Ee had also thrown out a suggestion thathe might call together the representatives of theDominions at Geneva and inform them that,  in orderto create a favourable atmosphere for the ottawa conference, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom had agreed to make this concession.   TheSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs had under-taken to telephone his final decision the same evening to the Chancellor of the Exchequer..
agricultural and FISHERIESPOLICY.(previous reference:Cabinet 7(52)., Con-clusion 4.)3. The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to Agricultural and FisheriesPolicy:-The Report of the Cabinet Committee(CP.-21 (52)):A Memorandum by the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries (CP.-46(32)) directing attention to those questions of Agricultural Policywhich still require a decision ofthe Cabinet (Appendix):A Note by the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries (C.P .-60 (32)) covering a draft of the kind of Statement thatmight be made in the House of Commonseither by the Leader of the House orby the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries himself, setting forth the Governments Agricultural Policy.The discussion was focussed mainly on thedraft statement contained in fa e last-namedMemorandum.Attention was called to the statement in.para-graph 1 of CP.-60 (32) that the most effectiveimmediate action, which can be taken to help theindustry generally is the imposition of tariffs on imports.    It was suggested that this did. not represent the Cabinet&apos;s policy in true perspective.The Duties were beinp imposed mainly from the pointof view of the balance of trade, whereas this statement gave the impression that they were to beapplied for protective purposes.   As a matter of fact, however, meat and wool were excluded from theDuties, and \vheat was being dealt with by the QjuotaMoreover, a 10 per cent, tariff would not beregarded by farmers as adequate for protective purposes.    It was suggested, therefore, that thefirst sentence of the draft Statement should bere-arranged so as to bring into the forefront themain , l;/items of the Government&apos;s Agricultural Policy..
i5This might be done by inserting, after the first sentence of paragraph 1, a reference to Wheat asbeing the most depressed branch of agriculture,and introducing a reference to the Quota.    this might be. followed by. bringing into prominence a reference to such matters as Milk Production,the Re-organisation of Marketing, and Policy inthe matter of Bacon Production.   The tariff, whichwas a subsidiary part of the Policy, cottld bereferred to incidentally in the Statement as required,The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,though not dissenting from the suggestion that theStatement should be re-drafted on the above lines,pointed out that some of the items in the policy would cost money.   For example, the Committee, tobe set up on Milk Re-organisation might requirefrom  6,000 to  8,000 8-^9*.   He wished theCabinet to realise this in taking their decision.The Prime Minister said he had assumed that inaccordance with Cabinet procedure the Policy hadbeen discussed in its financial aspects with theTreasury before being brought to the Cabinet.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Statement on agricultural and Fisheries Policy attached toCVP.-60 (32) should be re-draftedon the lines of the Cabinet dis-cussion, and that the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries should,,in the first instance, forward itto the Lord President of the Council:(b) That, before forwarding the revised draft Statement to the Lord President,the Minister of Agriculture and.Fisheries should discuss its financial aspects with the Chancellor of theExchequer:(c) That the following recommendationof the Agricultural Policy Committeeshould be adopted:-
&quot;(n) The proposal to supplyhome-killed beef to HisMajesty&quot;s Forces shouldnot be adopted at thepresent time&quot; (CP ,-21(32), page 24, par a . 54 i.(d) To leave to the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries thedecision on the following recom-mendation in the Report of theAgricultural Policy Committee:-&quot;(o) If the Cabinet desire to reverse the decision notto make any government grant towards the scheme,providing unemployed allot-ment holders with seeds,fertilisers,  etc., at cheaprates, we recommend that theyshould consider the questionof assisting the Society ofFriends on a   for   basis,the Government interest beingwatched by a representative on the Committee administering the fund.&quot;(HOTE:    The Chancellor of the Exchequer, whohad left during the discussionsummarised in Minute 2, returnedat this point and made the reporton page 7 above, after which, thePrime Minister left the Cabinet.)
4. The Cabinet resumed discussion of aproposal by the President of the Board of Trade,contained in his Memorandum C.P.-50 (3S)  that aOlause should be inserted in the Import DutiesBill empowering the Board of Trade to issue orders imposing Customs Duties discriminatingagainst nations exercising discrimination againstUnited Kingdom exports .The President of the Board of Trade reportedthat the Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed withhim that his object could be attained by a clause in the Import Duties Bill.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that the Foreign Office rather welcomed the proposal.The President of the Board of Trade explained,in reply to a question,  that the Clause would only apply where there was no most-favoured-nationTreaty.    At present the Clause was directedmainly against France, but other nations were known to be closely watching French discrimination and it was possible that some nations mightdenounce their Most-FaVoured-Nation Treaties withours elves.The Secretary of State for the Colonies saidthat he had asked that the Clause might be made applicable to discrimination against the produce of a Colony.Subject to the above, the cabinet approved the proposal of thePresident of the Board of trade for the insertion in the ImportDuties Bill of a DiscriminationClaus e.
5.  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum, bythe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (CP.-56(38)) reporting, as requested by the Cabinet atthe Meeting referred to in the margin, upon asuggestion that the Home Wheat Quota Bill should contain a provision for appropriate reconsiderationand alteration by executive decision of the basic price from time to time.   As the result of hisenquiry the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesinclined to the view that it would be an advantagefor provision to be made in the Bill for a reviewof the situation after a suitable interval, andhe proposed to provide for an enquiry to take placethree years hence into the suitability of the basic price, having regard to the agricultural andgeneral economic conditions then prevailing.Some doubt was expressed as to whether,  insteadof providing for an enquiry three years hence, itwould not be better for the Wheat Commission tohold an enquiry every year before the ploughings eas on.After a short discussion the Cabinet agreed.  To authorise the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries to draft his Bill on the basis ofthe proposal in C.P.-56 (32).
EMPLOYMENT 6. The Cabinet had before them the Report ofPOLICY.a Committee presided over by the Financial(Previous Secretary to the Treasury, composed of Parlia-Reference:Gabinet 89 mentary Under-Secretaries of a number of Depart-(31), Con-elusion 7.) ments, on Employment Policy (C.P.-36 (32)), theE^.

9 o -fht fa j[.7.The Cabinet had before them the followingcuments on the subject of Export Credits:-A Note by the President of theBoard of Trade (CP.-54 (32))circulating a Memorandum on Export    ,&quot;Credits by the Secretary to theDepartment of Overseas Trade,recommending that the export credits Guarantee AdvisoryCommittee should be free, as.in the past, to consider pro-posals involving credits of morethan twelve months, subject,  in sofar as Russia is concerned, to any decision which the Cabinet may take on the recommendations of the CabinetCommittee on Trade with Russia:An Interim Report by the CabinetCommittee on Trade with Russia(CP.-61 (32)) stating that theCommittee had invited the ForeignOffice forthwith to enter into negotiations with the soviet ambassador in London, pointing outthe amount of the adverse balanceof trade with Russia;    asking whether the Soviet Government,   have any suggestion remedyingthis state of affairs;    drawing attention to the large Russiansterling balances available inthis country;   and warning him that His Majesty&apos;s Government feelthat they cannot for long acquiesce in the present state of affairs, andthat if it continues they will be forced to consider seriously thequestion of taking steps to attainthe end desired.

APPENDIX.SECRET.CP. 46(52).CABINET.Agricultural and Fisheries Policy,Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.1.    At the meeting of the Cabinet sin Friday 22nd January,.1932,  the proposal was made  (Cab. 7(32) Conclusion 4)  that theReport of the Agricultural Policy Committee (CP. 21(32))should be withdrawn until the Chancellor of the Exchequer had submitted to the Cabinet his proposals on the Balance ofTrade, when the Report could be re-examined in the light of theCabinet decision on general Balance of Trade policy.    This,memorandum directs attention to those questions or agricultural policy which still require a decision of the Cabinet.2.    The Report of the Agricultural Policy Committee(CP. 21(32)) is divided-Into two parts dealing respectivelywith short range and long range policy.    The committee recommend in regard to both agriculture and fisheries that theGovernment&apos;s short range policy should be one of tariffs on imports,  and they express the opinion that if there is to bea ^general tariff over a wide field the same principle as. is adopted for imports generally should be applied in like nannerto imported agricultural commodities,  and to fish of all kinds,,including canned fish (paras. 14 and 57).    The Committee alsosubmit a list of agricultural commodities and of certain kinds of fish which might be included in a selective tariff (paras. 25and 59 - 61).The Secretary of State for Scotland has made certainreservations to the recommendations of the Committee in anote appended to the report.3.    The decision of the Cabinet in connection with thebalance of trade disposes of the question of a general tariff on agricultural products and on fish,  so far as it is raised
1    2 2 *ilin this report.   The eventual rato of duty on certain of these imports Yd.ll, however, depend on the result of the negotiations at the Ottawa Conference, it being understood that tariff concessions to the Dominions at that   Conference will, in theinterests of hone agriculture9 take the form, in some cases,not of free entry Into the United Kingdom but at a rate of dutymore favourable than the rate charged on the products offoreign countries.4.   The question whether there should be any selectivesurtaxes on non-essential agricultural products and on fishwill presumably fall for the consideration of the AdvisoryCommittee which is to be set up to deal with that subject05.   There is, however, one commodity which calls forspecial mention in the Government^ statement of policy.    Thisis malting barley (page 13, paragraph 29),   The committee recommend that pending the preparation of a quota scheme, whichwill take time, the Cabinet should agree to the imposition ofa -selective customs duty on malting barley conditional on its being found by further investigation(l) that the cost of staining or kibbling importedbarley not intended for malting is not likelyto increase unduly the price of feeding barleysin this country; and(2) that the process of staining or kibbling will be effective for the purpose in view.In view of the fact that all barley (Le, feedingbarley as well as malting barley) will be included In thegeneral tariff of 10% there will be a strong demand from farmers for a surtax on malting barley only, and I suggest thatif the Cabinet agree with the committee s recommendations,the Government&apos;s announcement cf agricultural policy should include a statement that the administrative feasibility oflevying a Customs duty on malting barley is under consideration
uwith a view to the question of a surtax being referred to theadvisory Committee at the earliest possible date.6. The only other question in connection with agriculturaltariffs which requires a decision of the Cabinet is therecommendation of the Agricultural Policy Committee that the horticultural Products (Emergency Customs Duties) Act shouldbe continued (page 8, paragraph 31).7.    There are still to be considered the recommendations ofthe Committee on long range policy which, the Committee suggest,should be designed to facilitate economic development and re-organisation in those branches of the agricultural industry which, in the long run, are likely to be the most remunerative(paras.  34 et seq.).    In this connection decisions by theCabinet are required on the following recommendations of theCommittee;n?(a) Milk.  The Committee recommend that the Governmentannouncement should include a statement that theGovernment intend to pursue a comprehensive policyIn regard to milk and milk products involving tariffs- on Imports (which will now be imposed as part ofthe general tariff),  the reduction of disease amongdairy herds and the improvement of marketing.    TheCommittee recommend that ah approved scheme for reducing bovine tuberculosis should be:.put intooperation at the earliest possible date,    and i suggest that a small Committee of Officials ofthe Departments concerned with this question should&quot;fee appointed to consider the matter and report on what,in their opinion.? is the most suitable scheme.   Asregards marketing the National Farmers&apos; Union attheir annual meeting a few days ago passed aresolution by a small majority recommending that a
% 2 6re-organisation commission under the agricultural marketing Act, 1931, should he set up for the milk industry (pages 16 and 17).(D) Potatoes.    The Committee recommend that the government statement should include an undertaking to appoint are-organisation commission, if desired by potatogrowers, with instructions to prepare a scheme forthe organisation of the marketing of the home potatocrop and to consider such complementary actionconsistent with treaty obligations as may appear tobe necessary or desirable for the regulation ofimports of main crop potatoes (page 17, para. 40).(c) Bacon and Hams- The Committee do not suggest a tariff on bacon and hams. They recommend that the Governmentshould constitute an ad hoc committee charged withthe task of preparing a scheme for the organisationof the bacon industry, and that the government statement on agricultural policy should contain an assurance that, provided a satisfactory s cheme isevolved, the Government is prepared to adopt some form of quantitative regulation of imports consistent with treaty obligations (page 20, para. 46).(d) Agricultural Bforkers. The Committee recommend thatany announcement of the Government policy respectingagriculture should include a statement of thefacilities at present available for investigatingoomplaints that the requirements of the Orders madeunder the Agricultural Wages (Regulation) Act arenot being observed.    Some members of the committee consider that with a view to increasing the numberof test inspections, a specific undertaking should begiven to restore wholly or partially the specialtemporary inspectorate which was recently dispensed
