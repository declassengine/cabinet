1.    The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to Foreign Affairs.A Memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs,  (paper No. CP. 98 (32)),containing an account of a conversation he had held with M, Tardieu in Paris,covering a wide range of subjects which affect France and the United Kingdom, includingthe economic position in Central -Europe;A Memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs (Paper No, CP. 101  (32)),containing proposals with a view to theeconomic restoration of Central Europe.The two questions of policy on which theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs desired a rulingby the Cabinet were as follows:-(1) Am I authorised to press for a conference which will include the great Powers aswell as the Danubian States, with discretion to settle the questions ofprocedure as they arise?(2) Am I authorised to indicate in advance the readiness of His Majesty&apos;s Government,as an exceptional measure and withoutprejudice to any fundamental principle,not only to consider favourably but tofacilitate as far as they reasonablycan a scheme of preferential tariffsfor Central Europe, even though this involves the abandonment in specifiedcases of   our - most-^favoured-nation rights?The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsalso suggested that a Cabinet Committee should beset up to assist him in dealing as expeditiously aspossible with the various further, though subsidiary,questions of policy involved in this complicatedproblem that were bound to arise in the course ofthe negotiations.The main difficulty revealed by the discussion in the acceptance of these proposals arose inconnection with the abandonment,  in certain circum-stances, of our most-favoured-nation rights.
At present, it was explained, our exports to the danubian States are small,  owing to the badeconomic conditions and the difficulty of obtainingexchange for purposes of payment.     When prosperityreturned our trade must not be prejudiced, ascompared with other nations.     Prom this point ofview it was important first that any advantage thatmight be conceded to any countries outside the danubian States should also be granted to the UnitedKingdom;    and second,  that Czechoslovakia, whichis a formidable competitor with ourselves, shouldnot be left in a specially favoured position.In the course of the discussion various suggestions were made.     For example, it was proposedthat the arrangements between the Danubian states might be limited to agricultural produce, in which case the waiving of most-favouredr-nation rights couldbe made without injury to our trade,      It was statedthat there were precedents for proposals on theselines in other parts of Europe.Another suggestion was that Czechoslovakiacould hardly be included properly among distressedDanubian Statesr .   It was pointed out, however,that Czechoslovalia should not be excluded as she wasthe potential market for the produce of the distressedagricultural Danubian States and that.her quid pro quowould be an outlet for her manufactui   s.A third suggestion was that any suspension of most-favoured-nation rights should be temporaryonly, and it was generally agreed that this suggestion
ought to be borne in iaind.A fourth suggestion was that if and whenthe question of a loan to these States arose, asit certainly would at some stage in the negotiations,we might make the purchase of British manufacturedgoods a condition of the loan.A fifth suggestion was that action shouldnot be taken until the report of the Financial Committeenow meeting at Geneva was to hand.A sixth suggestion iwas that in the long run British interests would benefit more by averting collapse in thesecountries and enabling their prosperity to bere-established than by a strict insistence on most-rfavoured-nation rights.The question was raised as to which countries could properly be called Danubian States.      TheCabinet were informed that originally seven states had been mentioned, including Poland and Bulgaria,but it had been ascertained that Poland did not desire to take part.      The list was now confined to czechoslovakia, Yugoslovia, Austria, Hungary,Roumania.     The Cabinet were informed that one view was that if an arrangement could not be securedbetween the five States a beginning might be madeby two or three of them.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should be authorisedto press at once for a conference which will include the great Powers,as, well as the Danubian States, with discretion to settle questions ofprocedure as they arise;
(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should also beauthorised to indicate in advance the readiness of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, as an exceptionalmeasure, and without prejudice toany fundamental principle, toconsider a scheme of preferentialtariffs between the Danubian Stateseven if it may conflict in some respects with our most-favoured-nation rights;(c) That if, as the result of this conference, any advantage was conceded to any power outsidethe Danubian States, we should,if our interests were affected,insist on receiving not less favourable terms;(d) That before action was actuallytaken a communication should bemade to the Dominions and India;(e) That the question of government financial assistance to the danubian States did not arise atpresent and would require adecision of the Cabinet.(f) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should keep in touch, as required,with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the President of the Board of Trade andthe Secretary of State for DominionAffairs and arrange meetings if necessary.(The Prime Minister asked the Chancellorof the Exchequer,  the Secretary ofState for Foruign Affairs and the Presidentof the Board of Trade to examine theConclusions with special care).-k-
BUDGETARYLIMITATION0? ARMAMENTS(previous reference:Cabinet 2(32),  Con-elusion 2.)THE DISARMAMENTCONFERENCE,(previous reference:Cabinet 17(32),  Con-clusion 1.)2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer (C.P.-97 (32))giving reasons why he was satisfied that we ought not to support the policy of Budgetary Limitationof Armaments under present circumstances.    Itmight be that at some future date it would prove a valuable supplement to other methods of restriction of armaments, but as things were now he thoughtit would be more of a danger than a support,The Cabinet agreed --(a) That the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s Memorandum shouldbe referred.for considerationby the Cabinet Committee onpisarmament:.. (b) That the Cabinet Committeeshould meet at an early date to consider the presentposition and prospects pfthe Disarmament Conference,
S. The Prime Minister said that he had instructed the Secretary to place on the agenda paper the question of National Power and transport and the Government&apos;s policy towards these ques-tions .    He had, however, received, a communication from the Minister of Transport, who had asked that the . subject might be postponed, ashe had a number of questions relating to themain issue under consideration.
4. The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary (CP.-103 (32)) covering a list of bills which, in the opinion of the Ministers concerned,should be passed into law before the Summer RecessThe Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook toinform the Prime Minister as to the general scopeof item 7 on the list attached to CP .-102 (32),namely, the Bill dealing with the FinancialEmergency, and as to how much Parliamentary time was likely to be required.The Secretary of State for the Colonies saidthat item 10, namely, the Bill dealing with Malta,need not be introduced before Easter.The Minister of Health undertook to consider carefully the political issues involved in the postponement of the Rent Restrictions Bill and tocommunicate with the Prime Minister on the subject.The Home Secretary said that he was waiting to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary to theTreasury as to when time could be found for the sunday Performances Bill,   He said that the.Extradition Bill (item 18 on the list) was a verysmall Bill.The President of the Board of Trade was unableto state as yet whether two Coal Mines Bills or one would be reqxiired.    He undertook to inform thePrime Minister in due course.The Prime Minister said that his object in asking for this list of Bills was to enable theHouse to rise, if possible, within the firstfortnight of July, so as to free Ministers for the conferences at Lausanne, Ottawa and Geneva (Seefollowing Conclusion).

CHINA and japan,.Events at shangai.(previous reference:Cabinet 17(3B), Con-elusion 1 .)10. The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs informed the Cabinet that it was being suggested at Geneva, that the Delegation of the United kingdom had been responsible for keeping the representativeof South Africa off the Committee that had beenappointed by the Assembly to watch the Shanghaisituation during its adjournment.    It appeared that some States had voted for South Africa, whichhad failed to secure election to the Committee by only one vote,    ^he suggestion was that the reason why the United Kingdom Delegation had kept theSouth African Delegate off the Committee was a speech he had made in favour of a stronger attitudeby the Assembly towards Japan.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that he had consulted Dominions representa-tives as to whom they should vote for..   For example,Holland, with its large interests in the Far East,certainly ought to have been elected.   As therepresentatives of the United Kingdom, and the IrishFree State were already members of the Committeeowing to their membership of the Council of theLeague, it had not occurred to anyone to proposeanother Dominions representative.   He had not evenbeen aware that South Africa was standing as a candidate, but there had been no question of &quot;black-balling&quot; South Africa,The Cabinet congratulated the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs on the remarkable success which he had achieved at Geneva,
