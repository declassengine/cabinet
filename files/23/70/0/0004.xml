1.   The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs made a statement to the Cabinet on the presentposition of Reparations and War Debts,  to thefollowing effect:The position as regards the Lausanne conference is critical.   We are already on the eve of the suggested meeting next Monday, January 2 5th, andthat date is a week later than the one originally proposed for the Conference, via., Monday, January18th.    Nevertheless the French Government has notyet assented even to the 25th.   Consequently it looked as if the Lausanne meeting could not takeplace on the 25th.    The French had this muchexcuse, that they had been plunged into a politicalcrisis.   The latest news of M. Laval&apos;s attitude was not helpful, as he had adjourned his Debateuntil Thursday   probably owing to the excitementin the Chamber, involving the need for politicalconversations before it was resumed       and theFrench President of the Council was unable togive his decision until after he had receivedhis Vote of Confidence.More difficult than the question of date wasthat of substance.    Here the essential trouble was a difference of point of view not only betweenPrance and Germany, but a difference between theBritish and French standpoint vis-a-vis war debtsto the United States of America.    The French knewperfectly well that their ease for remission orreadjustment was worse than otirs. and that we hadthe better moral position.   They wished to approach the United States Government with us.   As theCabinet were aware from the telegrams circulated,the British Government had received the strongest
possible advice, both from the American Charge&quot;d&apos;Affaires here and from our own Ambassador in washington, that our interest was to deal withthe American Government in this matter independently.Another point of difficulty was that no final solution to the problem of Reparations could bereached at the present stage.    The only possibilitywas a short extension of the moratorium.    Prance,while not refusing a short suspension, insisted on what were called the &quot;Hoover G^e44rt4*3**e-&quot;, which included the payment by the German Railways ofMarks to the Bank for International Settlements,which re-lent them to the German S-ovornmefyt.During the previous night the first ray ofhope had appeared.   After the Germans had&apos;refusedthe first proposal for a moratorium on Hooverconditions, strong pressure had been put on germany by the British Government to accept.    It had been pointed out to them that we were taking risks, andthat they must do the same to help towards asettlement.   The British Ambassador had seen theGerman Chancellor again, and the latter had indicated a possibility that if the lausanne conference was adjourned to a date not later thanJune and that then a real effort would be made tosecure a permanent settlement, he might be able topersxiade his colleagues to ad^owrrt tho-Conferenaawould be that Dr. Pruning, under our pressure,would agree to continue the moratorium on theexisting conditions, with the additional stipulationthat the Lausanne Conference should meet withinmonths ..   An answer was expected during the morning.
six months and that, then the issue would be properly defined.    Then would come the real crux,namely, the settling of the terms of reference tothe Lausanne meeting.    Here, if Dr. Bruning acceptedour proposal, we should be in a strong tacticalposition vis-a-vis the French Government,   We could say that we had secured a concession from Germanyand that Germany was willing to continue themoratorium for six months, notwithstanding thatit increased the mortgage on the railways .In fixing the terms of reference Prance wanted a Conference &quot;To study the means of remedying in&quot;a lasting manner the economic and financial&quot;difficulties which were responsible for and&quot;might result in .      prolonging the present crisis&quot;.Their aim in this te^ms of reference was to securethe presence of an American representative.   Thatwould not only be against our Interests but would produce a rebuff from the United States.    If,however, we obtained the hoped-for acceptance byGermany of a moratorium on Hoover conditions, itmight be possible to negotiate some acceptableterms of reference with Prance:    possibly, forexample, a Conference to consider Reparations inthe first instance, and War Debts later.It was necessary to bear in mind that in any event Germany did not intend to pay any furtherreparations, though she wished to accomplish this without putting herself in the position of havingtorn up another &quot;scrap of paper&quot;.   Consequentlythere was no question of our being better off orworse off financially so far as German paymentswrere concerned.   In the circumstances he thought the proper course was to help Germany to obtain
a short adjournment of the Conference on theterms he had suggested, but not to get mixed up with the French in the matter of the War Debt to america.The Prime Minister reminded the Cabinet thathe and the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who hadbeen discussing this question until nearly mid-night on the previous evening, had also to bearin mind the question of our commercial credit.If nothing was done they had to ask what would bethe effect on our own banking situation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer added thatthe situation was slightly better in regard, tothe &quot;Standstill&quot; Agreement, owing to the widespreadbelief that, whatever Governments might say, thepayment o^ reparation had come to an end.   But solong as the question v/as not definitely settledthere remained an element of doubt which containedan element of danger to ourselves.The Cabinet took note of the reportby the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, and gave him full authority and discretion to issue, at such time as he deemed desirable, anannouncement based, (subject to such drafting alterations as might bedeemed advisable) on the following:-&quot;It has now become evident thatthe Conference of the Powerson the subject of German Repara-tions, which it was intended tohold, at Lausanne next Monday,cannot take place on the actualdate arranged.    The BritishGovernment&quot;feel bound to express their regret that this should beso.   They entertain the earnesthope that a-Conference for thispurpose should take place as soonas possible in the near future,and they will continue to workfor the earliest possible meeting.Conversations are continuing betweenthe Governments, and the BritishGovernment trust that the post-ponement will be brief&quot; .
&apos; 2. The Cabinet had before them the R.eport ofa Cabinet Committee (C,P.-27 (32)), presided overby the Prime Minister, on the proposal that a mediterranean Looarno Agreement should, if neces-sary, be put forward or agreed to by the delegation of the United Kingdom at the forthcoming Disarma-ment Conference as one of the inducements to theFrench Government to reduce its armaments.   Therecommendation of the Cabinet Committee, as setforth in the last paragraph, is as follows:-&quot;Our general conclusion is that thefailure of the Disarmament Confer-ence would be a disaster, theeffects of which can hardly be measured.   We have earnestlyconsidered a MediterraneanLocarno Agreement as ,one of themeasures that might be adopted to avert such a catastrophe., butwe cannot recommend the Cabinetto authorise the Delegation ofthe United Kingdom to put forwardor agree to the proposition.    Ouradvice   however, is withoutprejudice to the possibility ofa reopening of the question inconnection with any possiblereconsideration of the wholepolitical situation, which may benecessary in order to avert a breakdown of the DisarmamentConference.&quot;The Prime. Minister, in reply to a question,made it clear that the intention of the above recommendation was that the question of a Medi-terranean Locarno Agreement should not be putforward or agreed to by the United Kingdom Delega-tion at the Disarmament Conference, and that ifevents developed in such.a way as compelled themto face it, the Delegates should refer the matterback to the Cabinet.Subject to the above explanationthe Cabinet approved the Report ofthe Cabinet Committee (C.P.-27 (32)).

4. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by-the Minister of Labour (CP.-SO (32-)) askingauthority to introduce and pass through all its stages before the Easter Recess a Bill furtherextending the &quot;transitional period&quot; during whichpayments under the Transitional Payments scheme may be made to claimants who have not got the 30contributions qualification under the UnemploymentInsurance Scheme proper.   The Memorandum statedthat the Chancellor of the Exchequer concurred inthe proposed extension to June 30, 1933, subjectto any point which might arise on the draft Billwhen it is ready.The Minister of Labour said that while he would prefer the passage of the Bill before the easter recess, his requirements would be satisfied if itcould be passed before April 18th.The Cabinet authorised the Ministerof Labour to introduce and pass through all its Stages a Bill forthe above purposes, leaving thequestion of dates to be arranged by the Minister in consultation as necessary with the Prime Ministerand the Parliamentary Secretary tothe Treasury.
agricultural policy.The Home wheat quota.(previous reference:Cabinet 84(31), Con-elusion 6.)96^)6.5.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries(CP.-22 (32)) reporting to the Cabinet an agree-ment which he had. reached with&quot; the industries concerned as to the details of the Home wheat quota policy announced in the House of Commons onNovember 26, 1931.    Full details, with explana-tions as to the difference between the agreed plan and the original proposal, were attached to theMemorandum.The discussion of the scheme revealed doubt as to whether it was not wider in scope than theCabinet had contemplated, and as to whether itwould not involve a more perceptible increase of cost to the consumer.The Cabinet agreed  That a Committee, composed as follows -The Lord President of the Council(In the Chair)The Lord Privy seal the Secretary of State for theColonies,The Secretary of State for War,The Minister of Agriculture andFisheries,The Secretary of State for Scotland -should examine the proposals of theMinister of Agriculture and fisheries and report as to how far they con-sidered it to be the best scheme that could be produced in order toenable a system of a Wheat Quota tobe applied to British farming.The Committee was asked to invitethe presence of an Official of theBoard of Trade with knowledge offood prices and similar questions,and to consult the Treasury so faras might be found necessary.(NOTE:  It was arranged that the Committee should.  meet the same afternoon at 3 p.m.)
WATERLOO 6. The Cabinet had before them a MemorandumBRIDGE .by the Minister of Transport (CP.-30 (32)) reporting(Previous that he had conferred with the First Commissioner ofReference:Cabinet 1 Works on the subject of Waterloo Bridge, and that(32), Con- v  &apos;elusion 7.) the results of his interview with the Chairman ofthe Improvements Committee of the London County*o^3^^ Council were as follows(l) The London County Council are adverseto the plan of restoring waterloo bridge to a state of efficiency withoutaltering its design or dimensions andconstructing an additional bridge tothe east of Somerset House (the TempleBridge)., and had given him a writtenreport of the objections, which were attached in an Appendix to his memorandum.(2) That he had informed the Chairman ofthe Improvements Committee that theGovernment would not be able to makea grant of more than 60 per cent.; ofthe cost of any approved scheme fordealing with Waterloo Bridge.(3) He had added that, in accordance withthe practice of the Ministry, astipulation would be attached to thegrant that the Council should take effective steps to secure a properarchitectural design and should submit their proposals for approval from thetechnical and other points of view.(4) That the Chairman of the ImprovementsCommittee had given him an assurance that the Council would, for the purposeof advising them and carrying out thework, associate an eminent engineerand an architect of high standing andrepute.(5) The Chairman had also agreed that ata later stage it might be advisable forthe Council to give the Royal Commissionon Fine Arts an opportunity of commentingupon the design proposed for the new-bridge., but without any right of veto. ,The Minister of Transport added that he proposed to inform Sir Percy Simmons confidentiallythat he was unable to give him a formal decision as to the Government&apos;s attitude until the LondonCounty Council have themselves decided (as the responsible authority) what scheme to recommend,
on the merits of the ease, for adoption, hut that ifafter full consideration the Council are satisfiedthat the alternative of a new Temple Bridget, whichwould save Waterloo Bridge from, destruction, is notfeasible, and that the proper course is to constructon the site of the existing bridge a new one for sixlines of traffic, the Government will not oppose orobstruct their proposal.     This would be subject tothe Council giving an undertaking to act underproper architectural advice, and the grant from theRoad Fund would be 60 per cent, of the approved costof an approved scheme.As the London County Council meets onThursday, the Minister proposed to inform Sir PercySimmons to the foregoing effect on the afternoon ofWednesday, January 20th.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Minister of &quot;transport as set-forth above..
INDIA. 7, The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum bySituation in.    the Secretary of State for India (C.P,-18 (32))covering copies of telegraphic reports from the(previous reference: Local Governments in India on the Political SituationCabinet 1(32),  Con-       in India, circulated for information,elusion 6.)
INDIA. 8. The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum byRepayment of the Secretary of State for India (C.P.-23 (32))55 Per cent.Loan on january-        recording an announcement that the Secretary ofary 15, 1932.State for India will repay on Friday (15th January,1932) the outstanding balance ( 11,213,428) of the india &amp;jj per cent. Loan issued in two instalments( 10,000,000 and  12,500,000 respectively) inDecember 1921 and June 1922.    In a commentary onthis announcement the Secretary of State recalledthe financial crisis in India with which the firstNational Government were faced at the end ofSeptember,1931, and how, in the faoe of greatopposition and serious warnings, they had decided,firstly, that the Rupee should be tacked on to sterling, and, secondly, that whatever might bethe political reactions the Indian Budget must be balanced.    The above announcement justified those decisions, and was an illustration of the advantageof control from Whitehall at least upon this occasion.The Cabinet congratulated the Secretary ofState for India on what had been accomplished,and the Secretary of State paid a tribute to histechnical advisers.
JUDGES&apos; 9. The Lord Chancellor informer! the CabinetSALARIES.that difficulties had arisen with the Judges as(Previous to the cuts in their salaries.    He had receivedReference:Cabinet 79 deputations both before and after Christmas, and(31), Con-clusion 14.)    on the previous evening a deputation had visitedf  the Prime Minister.    Before Christmas theircontention had been that they had a contract fora salary of  5,000 a year, which was confirmed by statute.    Since Christmas, however,, they had dropped this approach to the question..   They nowadmitted that their salaries could be cut by statute, but claimed that this had not been done.Their case was that the Government had passed a statute enabling them to do certain things byOrder in Council.   This had been applied to the judges, on the ground that they were a branch ofHis Majesty&apos;s Service,    &quot;hey claimed that thiswas an illegality, and supported their contentionby citing an article in the &quot;Law Quarterly&quot; bySir William. Holdsworth.    Lawyers were not unanimouson this point, and there was grave doubt on thequestion.    In any event it would be difficult tofind any tribunal to decide it.   There were three possible courses open to the Government.   First,to do nothing.    The Lord Chancellor emphasised the serious consequences which might result fromthat course, indicating the probable attitude ofvarious Judges.    Second, to pass a Statute reducingthe salaries to  4,000 a year.    It was doubtful,however, whether both Houses of Parliament would pass the Bill.   Third, to try and come to some arrangement with the Judges and get them to say how much they would do voluntarily.   A point on
which he laid the greatest emphasis was that itshould be made perfectly clear that nothing hadbeen done to alter the status of the Judges, andthat this was not in the mind of the Government.The Prime Minister confirmed the LordChancellor&apos;s view as to the importance of maintain-ing the prestige of the Judges, who had explained to him how they owed their status to ConstitutionalLaw and occupied a statutory position.After considerable discussion, in the courseof which several members of the Cabinet who were also members of the legal profession undertook touse their good offices to the best of their means,the Cabinet agreed  That the Lord Chancellor should seethe Judges again:    that on theConstitutional point he should,indicate clearly the desire of theGovernment to give them every possible assurance;    that on thefinancial point he should ascertain whether the Judges could be induced,by.voluntary reduction to produce anamount in the aggregate approximatingto the 20 per cent, cut, at any rateduring the first year, pending further arrangements for later years;and should then report back to theCabinet.

The situation, as revealed by the discussion,may be summed up &quot;as follows.The Lausanne Conference was due to meet onMonday, January 25th, but the new French Governmenthad not accepted this date and could, not give a finaldecision until after they had received a vote ofconfidence by the Chamber.The debate in the French Chamber had begun onthe same day, and m. Laval had made a statement inwhich, according to Press information, he had saidthat France could not forfeit her right to reparations .The debate in the French Chamber had been adjourned until Thursday, January 21st.The British Ambassador in Paris had reported(telegram No.7 of January 17th) that M. Laval andM. Flandin were against the Conference taking place atthe moment, but they were quite ready to advise theFrench Government to concede an extra year&apos;s moratorium,on the same conditions as those on which the presentyear&apos;s moratorium had been granted:   that is to say,the &quot;Hoover Conditions&quot;.   M, Laval was reported inthe same telegram as ready to propose to the FrenchGovernment that a Conference of the Powers should be summoned in the near future, say in June or July, todiscuss not only reparations but also general economicand financial conditions.   This proposal was made withthe object of securing the presence of the UnitedStates, who, M&apos;, Flandin had said, are reported tohave declared their readiness to participate in anInternational Economic and Financial Conference,whereas a Conference on Reparations alone excludedAmerican participation.   M. Flandin&apos;s statement borean unofficial character.
The British Ambassador had informed M,Flandinprivately on the following day (telegram No,9, ofJanuary 18th)  of the strong preference of the BritishGovernment for a moratorium without the Hoovermechanism.   M. Flandin had repeated a statement, already made several times, that he afnd M. Laval consideredthe Hoover mechanism essential to maintain a majority in the Chamber.    In these circumstances he had been told that, in order to assist in common action, theBritish Government would accept a moratorium with theHoover mechanism, subject to agreement respecting a future Conference and German agreement respecting HooverBritish and.mechanism.   He had proposed that the/French governments should make a joint declaration during the latter partof this week,  (i) that after careful exploration ofthe situation they did not consider the meeting at lausanne necessary at the present juncture;    (ii)thatthey were willing to propose to the other Governmentsconcerned the grant to Germany of an additional year&apos;smoratorium from July 1, 19 32, under the same condi-tions as the Hoover moratorium;    (iii) that they intended to propose assembly at as early a date aspossible of a Conference &quot;To study the means ofremedying in a lasting manner the economic andfinancial difficulties which were responsible forand might result in prolonging the present crisis&quot;.M. Flandin had proposed that no reference should bemade to War Debts except as implied in the words&quot;under the same&apos;conditions as the Hoover moratorium&quot;.One of the conditions of that, moratorium had beenthe suspension of European war debts to America, andif America demanded those payments, during the year-/beginning July 1, 1932, the wording would- imply thatthe conditions of the Hoover moratorium had not beenfulfilled..;&apos;:--:V&apos;:. &apos; i  -2-
On January 18th the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs had informed the German Governmentthat His Majesty&apos;s Government, faced with the factthat a permament settlement of the reparations problemon the lines desired was impracticable at Lausannethis month, as also was a long-term moratorium, whichwas opposed by both the French and German governments for different reasons, had had to modify their policy.After describing the negotiations with the FrenchGovernment and referring to His Majesty&apos;s Governmentsdislike -of the French Railway Bonds Scheme;    theirpreference for a simple suspension of payments;    their desire to avoid attaching any condition to a moratorium,involving United States co-operation;   he had statedthat the French Government had replied in the sense(a) that the Conference, if held this month, would,owing to the probable attitude of the Germans, leadto an impasse;    (b) suggesting the summoning of aConference in June or July to deal not only withreparations but also with economic and financial problems, with, if possible, the participation ofthe United States of America;    (c) agreeing inprinciple to the grant of an extra year&apos;s moratoriumto Germany, but insisting on the same conditions asthe present moratorium.The German Ambassador had replied that theGerman Government could not agree to the continuation of the Hoover mechanism.    They would agree,  ifnecessary, to a week or ten days&apos; adjournment of theConference in order to suit the French.    If, as seemed possible, the Lausanne Conference had to be adjourned, the German Government hoped that it would meet again not later than June.    (This message was delivered by the German Ambassador, but is alsocontained in Sir H. Rumbold&apos;s telegram of January19th,  Mo.15.)   .-3- .
The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs had then sent a strong telegram to Eerlin (No,25 ofJanuary 19th, to Sir Horace Rumbold) pointing outthe effect on public opinion here of the unhelpfulattitude of the German Government, and impressing upon them that the position taken up would make it impossibleto help in securing the agreement which was so muchto be desired.In the course of the discussion emphasis was laid on the difficulty of accepting IVu Flandin&apos;sbasis   . for a Conference in June, owing to thedifference in the point of view of the two Governmentsyis-a-vis war debts to America,   The French government wished the European debtors to approach the Americansjointly as regards war debts and to make the settlementof reparations dependent on a settlement of war debts ,All information, however, pointed to the fact thatGreat Britain, as regards her debt to America, was now in a category different from that of any other country, and we should only lose by being associatedwith France.We had a good-will at Washington whichit was important to preserve, and the British ambassador at Washington had expressed the hope that at theConference or in Parliament it would be possible forHis Majesty&apos;s Government to make it unambiguouslyclear that what they really desired as a first step wasa settlement with Germany without any condition aboutwar debts (Washington telegram No.30, of January 18th).In these circumstances the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment was to make a settlement of the questionof reparations in Europe and to tru-&apos;it to making asettlement afterwards with the United States of america as regards war debts.The &quot;Standstill&quot; Agreement, which was&apos;being
negotiated by Bankers in Berlin, had not yet beenreached.    There were conflicting reports, but sir frederick Leith-Ross had heard that day that there wasa prospect of an Agreement being signed or initialledin Berlin next week.It was pointed out that if the Agreement wasinitialled it would mean that it was subject to anagreement between-Governments before signature.The discussion was devoted mainly to thequestion of whether the Lausanne Conference could beheld or not.There was general agreement that in any event,as the French decision was likely to be postponed untilThursday or Friday, it oould hardly be held on Monday next.    In these circumstances some declaration by theBritish Government would be necessary before the endof the present week, in order to explain why theConference was not being held on the 25th.One view was that progress could not be made through diplomatic channels and that it would be better,notwithstanding the risks of disagreement, thatat LausanneMinisters should meet/, if not on the 25th, at anyrate a few days later, in order to try and reach.atemporary agreement.Another suggestion was that the lausanne conference should be postponed;    that the diplomaticconversations should continue;    and that advantage  /should be taken of the presence at the DisarmamentConference at Geneva of representatives of thevarious nations to discuss the situation in. two orthree weeks&apos; time.   The objection to. this was that it-would be essential to summon the Finance ministers as well as the Ministers who would normally be atGeneva.
Another suggestion was that as the postpone-ment of the Lausanne Conference would render it verydifficult for British Ministers to absent themselves from London immediately before or during the meetingof Parliament, a meeting should be held in London.Another suggestion, which had just beenreceived from Lord Tyrrell, in Paris, was that, inview of the excited state of opinion in the FrenchChamber that day, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should pay a visit to Paris.   An alternative to this was suggested, that the Lausanne conference should be held and that the British Ministers should arrive in Paris a day or two before the Conference, todiscuss matters with the French Government.Sir Frederick Leith-Ross said that he had heard that day from an official just arrived from berlin, who was well informed, that Dr. Bruning was anxious for the Lausanne Conference to take place.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs read the draft of a statement by the British Govern-ment to explain the postponement of the lausanne conference on the 25th.   As finally modified thestatement was as follows:-.&quot;It has now become evident that theConference of the Powers on the subjectof German Reparations, which it was intended to hold at Lausanne next Monday,cannot take place on the date arranged.The British Government feel bound toexpress their regret that this shouldbe so.   They entertain the earnest hopethat a Conference for this purpose should,take place as soon as possible in thenear future, and they will continue towork for the earliest possible meeting.Conversations are continuing betweenthe Governments,  and the BritishGovernment trust that the postponement-will be brief.&quot;Sir Robert Vansittart suggested that this statement, if approved, should be telegraphed to the
various nations concerned in the Conference, with anotification that it would he announced on January21st .The Committee agreed  That xintil a reply was received .to the further representations made by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to Berlin,which was expected.on thefollowing day, it was impossibleto take a decision.The Committee adjourned at11.30 p.m..  . .2, Whitehall Gardens, S^W.l,January 20, 1932.
