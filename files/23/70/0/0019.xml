CENTRAL EUROPE.I The Danubianf; States ,EconomicRestorationof.(previous reference:Cabinet 18(32), Con-clas ion 1,)1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that he was pursuing the question of theeconomic restoration of the Danubian States onthe lines of the policy approved by the Cabinet atthe Meeting referred to in the margin.   He hadreceived a personal letter from M, Tardieu, whowas pressing for a definite answer whether theproposed Conference on Danubian Relations shouldbe inaugurated by a communication from the fourGreat Powers inviting the five Danubian States tomeet amongst themselves, or whether a Round-table conference of all nine Powers was in contemplation.-After discussing the matter with Sir frederick leith-Ross he had come to the conclusion that themost useful plan would be to suggest that the fourGreat Powers concerned should consult together inorder to discover what would be the best means ofsolving the Danubian difficulties, and he had sent a private letter to M. Tardieu to this effect.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs also indicated that M. Tardieu still had some idea of paying a visit to London after Easter.The Prime Minister thought this was an excellent-idea, provided that it could be arranged withoutexciting undue expectations.A little later in the Meeting the Cabinet took note of the following documents circulated by thePresident of the Board of Trade with CP.-103 (32):-(i) A Note on Commercial Agreementsexisting between the United States .of America and the Danubiancountries:(ii) Statistics of United Kingdom tradewith the Danubian countries:(iii) Statistics of the trade of Czecho-Slovakia with the other Danubiancountries.

The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to Imperial Defence Policy,more particularly with reference to the assumptiongoverning the Estimates of the Defence Servicesand the Imperial Defence situation in the Far East:-A Most Secret Report by.the Chiefsof Staff Sub-Committee of theCommittee of Imperial Defence(CP.-104 (32)&apos;  coveringCI.D. 1082-B):
Hongkong and Trincomali (CI.D.1084-P, included with CP.-104(32)):An Extract from the draft Minutesof the 255th Meeting of theCommittee of Imperial Defence(CP.-115 (32)) containing thefollowing Gonelusion:-&quot;Pending the Report of theCoast Defence Sub-Committee,the Committee of ImperialDefence reached no conclusion on the recommendations containedin the Report of the Chiefs ofStaff Sub-Committee on the measures for increasing the security of singapore,  Hongkong andTrincomali (C.I.P. 1084-B),but agreed that the report should at once be brought tothe notice of the Cabinet&quot;.No dissent was expressed from the acceptance by the Committee of Imperial Defence of therecommendation    of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committeein favour of the cancellation of the assumptionon which the Estimates of the Defence departments have been based in recent years .   The cabinet recognised, however, that this must not be takento justify an expanding expenditure by theDefence Services without regard to the veryserious financial and economic situation thatstill obtains.   The Cabinet felt, also, that thewhole subject, which was closely connected withthe question of Disarmament, required further exploration.
The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the whole of the aboveReports should be referred for early consideration bythe D is armament C onferenc eMinisterial Committee:(b) ^hat in considering the Reportsthe Committee   could assume theabandonment of the assumptiongoverning the Estimates of theDefence Services during the last few years, that at any given datethere will be no major- war forten years .(MOTE: The Prime Minister mentioned thathe might find it convenient toarrange during the Recess for aMeeting of those members of theDisarmament Conference ministerial committee who were within reach ofLondon.    If such a Meeting took place,a full report would be made to theCommittee, and he hoped that thiscourse would be agreeable to hiscolleagues .)
3.The Cabinet took note of a Most SecretReport of the Advisory Committee on trade questions in time of war,  (Committee ofImperial Defence), dealing with the effectof economic sanctions against Japan,  (Paper No.CP.  92 (32), covering C.I.D. IO85-B).
4. The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of Disarmament:-A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs,  containing ageneral summary on the position atthe Disarmament Conference,  (Paper No.CP.  110 (32)-;A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs on the questionof Disarmament and Sanctions,  (PaperNo.  CP.   95  (32)) ;A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Air* on Air Disarmament and theAbolition of Bombing Aircraft,  (PaperNo. CP. 82 (32)) .The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thatthis subject had been placed on the Agenda paper as it had been thought possible that the DisarmamentConference Ministerial Committee might, have areport to make.   The Committee.., however, had met and had adjourned until Monday, April 4th, whenmaterial for a Report would be laid before them.The various issues raised in the Memoranda beforethe Cabinet were on the Agenda Paper of the CabinetCommittee.
THE IMPORT 5.   The Secretary of State for the ColoniesDUTIES EILL.  who spoke on this question in the absence of thei ProposedPreference Lord Chancellor, said that the Cabinet Committeeto palestine was not in a position to report its recommenda-(Previous tions that day.   The Law Officers of the CrownReference:Cabinet 17 had confirmed the Opinion of their predecessors(32), Con-clusion 3.) an(j had advised that there was a substantial riskin granting Tariff Preferences to Palestine,since we might be brought before the Hague court and become liable in damages both in respect ofthe amount of the Duty actually obtained andthe loss of trade resulting from the Duty.    Inview of this Opinion the Committee had met and had come to the conclusion that it was impossible toproceed with the matter at present.   A suggestion had then been laid before them that instead of^ampoou-ng a deputy it might be well to approach theforeign countries principally concerned in theimport of oranges (Spain,  Italy and Brazil) andths-n take the matter to^ihe Hague Court for ssaais%44e4;pat*033y Judgment.   At this point the attentionOf the Committee had been drawn to a difficulty which had arisen in connection with the prepara-tions for the Ottawa Conference, namely, thatcertain foreign countries were reported to claim the right, under their Most-Favoured-NationAgreements, to any Preferences granted to theDominions owing to the status conferred on theDominions by the Statute of Westminster.   TheCommittee on Preferences to Palestine had thoughtit worth while to postpone their own recommendationuntil they were in a position to consider the
bearing thereon or&quot; a Report on this latter subject which was being compiled by an Inter-DepartmentalC ommittee.In the course of a short discussion thesuggestion was made to the Cabinet, and was supported by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,  that it might be a good plan to informthe French Government of our desire to give a preference to Palestine, since they might be interested in the same way from the point of viewof Syria .This latter suggestion commended itself tothe Cabinet, both from the point of view of goodneigh.bo.ur 1 iness and of a possible reference tothe Hague Court.    They did not feel able to pursue the general question further pending the Reportof the Cabinet Committee. The Cabinet, however,agreed that the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs should be added to the Committee onPreferences to Palestine, set up on February 17th(Cabinet 14 (32),  Conclusion 9).
POLICE. 6. The Cabinet had. before them a Memorandumby the Home Secretary,  (paper No. CP.  94 (32)),-onomiesin Pay of. on the subject of Economies in Police Expenditure,at the end of which he made the following(previous reference: proposals:-Cabinet if(J1), Con- (1) The deductions from police pay shouldelusion 3). remain at the present rates (apartfrom any minor adjustments which maybe recommended by the Police council when the matter comes up for review),and the reduced rates of pay for new entrants should also remain as atpresent pending the contemplatedreview of the whole question.    (Thereduction is to 55/&quot; a v,reek from JO/-a week on first appointment.)(2) Certain economies, already discussed withthe Police Council, should be secured by administrative measures.(3) I should bring before the police council, who have a statutory right tobe consulted on matters affecting policepay,  this proposal;    that instead of half the advantage of the presentdeductions from pay accruing to theExchequer and half to the LocalAuthorities, the proportion should be changed to three-quarters and one-quarter respectively.    (Even that quarterwill be in the nature of a windfall tothe Local Authorities;    and,  in almost all cases,  it will be above,  or on apar with, the saving they are effectingfrom deductions in the pay of theirown employees).(A) These steps will enable the Exchequer toreceive in full the annual savingpreviously estimated.      I would add thatin point of fact the Exchequer will be receiving in 1932-33 about  300,00Q more;as,  owing to a change arranged some time ago in the method of calculating the advances of police grants to the LocalAuthorities, there will be a lag ofthat amount.      But this will not recur,It was added in the Memorandum that unless-the above course was pursued the Police Force as awhole is likely to feel seriously grievedf withthe possibility of undesirable consequences.
In view of the possible reactions on the economies of other Government Departments whichare      involved in the HomeSecretaryfs proposals, the Cabinet felt that thesubject required detailed exploration and agreedThat the proposals contained in cp .-94 (52) should be referredto a Committee of the Cabinetcomposed as follows:-The Chancellor of the Exchequer(In the Chair),The Home Secretary,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for Scotland,The Minister of Health,The President of the Board ofEducation,The Minister of Labour -with instructions to report as soonas possible.
jtfDAY 7* Ine Cabinet had before them a Memorandum2BPORMANCE3 , ,    svjg,. by the Home Secretary,  (Paper No. CP. 100 (32))covering a draft of the Sunday PerformancespreviousReference: (Regulation) Bill, and asking the approval ofCabinet 92(31), Con- the Cabinet to the immediate introduction ofjclusion 9)Y.the Bill with a view to its being available for second Reading should an opportunity offer soon after the Easter Recess.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thathe had approved this question being brought beforethe Cabinet without first being examined by theCommittee of Home Affairs for the reason that thenew Bill, subject to a few drafting amendments of minor importance, was in identical terms withMr Clynes.&apos; Bill as amended in Committee of theHouse of Commons.    He recalled the followingConclusion that had been taken by the Cabinet atthe Meeting referred to in the margin:-&quot;(b) That the Bill should be introduced as a Grovernment measure but shouldnot be supported by the GovernmentWhip&quot;.It followed, in consequence, that.theordinary Ministerial obligations of unitedsupport did not apply.The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet thathe had arranged for the Bill to be introduced bythe Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for theHome Department, who would be in charge of it during its passage through Parliament.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To authorise the immediate introduction,by the Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State for the Home Department,of the Sunday Performances (Regulation)
Bill in the form attached to0.P..-1O0 (32), subject to any-minor drafting alterations  thatmight be found necessary or desirable:(b) To reaffirm their previous decision -&quot;That the Bill should be intro-duced as a Government measurebut should not be supported bythe Government Whip.&quot;

The Cabinet had before them a MemorandumAIR FORCE(ANNUAL) BILL.       by the Secretary of State for War, (Paper No.CP. 106 (j52)), covering a draft of the Army and *(previous reference; Air Force (Annual) Bill.

9.    The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to Indianisation of the indian army:-(i) A Note by the Chairman of theDefence of India Sub-Committeeof the Committee of ImperialDefence,  (C.I.D. 180-D);(ii) An extract from the draft Conclusionsof the 255th Meeting of.the Committeeof Imperial Defence;Both the above were included inc.p. 111 (32).The Cabinet approved therecommendation of the Committeeof Imperial Defence that HisMajesty&apos;s Government&apos;s responsi-bilities in India are, and willremain, such that they cannotconceive that they or their successors could spare any effort,in the event of grave emergency,to secure her safety.
10.    The Secretary of State for India recalled that the Prime Minister,  in his statement on behalfof the Government at the close of the last Sessionof the Indian Round Table Conference, had notconcealed his conviction that the communal problem was above all one for agreement among the Indiancommunities.      He had, however, made it clearthat His Majesty&apos;s Government were determined that failure on their part to reach a settlement wouldnot be permitted to be a bar to progress, and thatin that event His Majesty&apos;s Government would be compelled to apply a provisional scheme.      the consultative Committee of the Round Table Conferencein India had been unable to reach any agreementthemselves and had sent a request asking HisMajesty&apos;s Government to admit that the periodallowed to the Indian communities had come to anend,  that the Indian communities had failed toagree, and that they themselves must now announce a decision.      The Mohammedans had indicated thatif some statement were made they would not press the Government unduly as to the date of theirannouncement.      Last week, however, he had receivedpersonal and official telegrams from the viceroy to the effect that, unless an undertaking to issue a decision was made before the Mohammedan Conferenceat Lahore on March 21st,  the Mohammedan communitieswould probably not co-operate further in the workof the Round Table Conference Committees.      TheViceroy had asked for a declaration, which wentfurther than the Cabinet Committee on India were willing to accept.     Eventually the Cabinet
Committee had approved a more moderate declaration,which had been made by the Viceroy and published.At first the effect of this appeared to have been good, but to-day&apos;s press indicated that theMohammedan Conference had got into difficulties,which was not unusual at Indian Conferences.      Hewas satisfied, however,  that no more explicitstatement could have been issued at the presenttime.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsurged the importance of defining the scope ofany decision which might be issued, and the subjects to which it would extend.      Otherwise there was a danger of His Majesty&apos;s Government being accused of bad faith unless they agreed to settle all kinds of questions that the Indians ought to settle themselves the Secretary of State for India said hehad forwarded to the Prime Minister a draft of atelegram to the Viceroy on this subject, and, atthe request of the Prime Minister, he undertook tosend a copy of the draft also to the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs.The Secretary of State for India also stated that, in the course of the Debate on indian the House of Commons on the morrow, he proposedto emphasise that the Government still considered&quot;all-India federation&quot; as the most hopeful line of advance, that is to say., he would reiterate theprevious position of the Government.The Cabinet took note of and approved the above statement bythe Secretary of State for India.
INDIA. 11. The Cabinet took note of&apos; Reports by theLocal Governments on the Situation in India,Situation in.circulated by the Secretary of State for India(Previous with CP. 105 (32).Reference:Cabinet 18(32), Con-elusion 9) .
12. The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum bythe Secretary to the Department of OverseasTrade,  circulated by the President of the Boardof Trade with CP.  10J (j?2) , describing thedevelopment of Anglo-Danish Commercial Relations.
13*     The Cabinet had before them a. Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs(CP.-114 (32)) containing the text of a Memorandumcommunicated to him the previous afternoon by theHigh Commissioner for the Irish Free State, togetherwith the following statement that, subject to theapproval of the Cabinet, he proposed to make inthe House of Commons the same afternoon in replyto a Private Notice Question:-&quot;The High Commissioner for theIrish Free State in answer to myenquiries yesterday informed methat, in the opinion of hisGovernment,  the Oath of Allegianceis not mandatory in the Treaty andthat the Irish Free State have an absolute right to modify their constitution as the people desire.His MajestyTs Government in theUnited Kingdom have received this information with deep regret.    Intheir view the Oath is an integral part of the Treaty made ten yearsago between the two countries andhitherto honourably observed on both sides.    They are addressingto His Majesty&apos;s Government in theIrish Free State a communication which will make their standpointclear beyond a possibility of doubt.His MajestyTs Government in theUnited Kingdom further understand from a statement made by Mr de Valerain Dublin that the Irish Free StateGovernment propose to retain theLand Annuities.As to these,  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdomwish to make it clear that theyconsider that they have an entirelyvalid claim to payment.    Their answer on this point will be no less emphatic.&quot;The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs  .tiinformed the Cabinet that the Irish Free StateHigh Commissioner, before leaving for Dublin a fortnight ago to meet Mr. de Valera, had promised to report to him on his return.     When he had seen
him yesterday the High Commissioner had made quite clear that he was addressing him- as High Commissioner,) and speaking for the Irish Free State Government.He said that in case an answer was to be sent tothe document handed to him by Mr. Dulanty, he was having it drafted, in consultation with the LawOfficers of the Crown.      He thought it important,however, that the Cabinet Committee should beasked to approve the reply before it was sent.He mentioned the possibility that Mr. de Valeramight desire a change in the Governor-General,but this,  though it gave rise to serious difficulties,was not a matter in which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentcould intervene.The Cabinet directed its attention first to the second part of the draft statement inParliament,  contained in para. 8 of CP.  11 if (j52),dealing with the reported statement by Mr. de Valerain Dublin that the Irish Free State government proposed to retain the land annuities.The Chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs proposedamendmentsThe Cabinet then turned to the first partof the draft statement, dealing with the Oath of allegiance...    Some emphasis was placed on theimportance of the opening wordsj and discussion took place as to the precise circumstances inwhich the High Commissioner for the Irish FreeState had,  on the previous day,  come to hand tothe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs thestatement reproduced in para. 2 of CP. 11A (j?2).
The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Chancellor of theExchequer,  the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and the Secretaryof State for War should collaborate with the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs in settling the precise terms of the statement tobe made by the latter in the Houseof Commons the same afternoon, onthe questions of the Oath of allegiance and the Land Annuities.NOTE;    A copy of the private notice question and Answer, as approvedimmediately after the Meeting, by theabove Members of the Cabinet,  isattached in the Appendix to these minutes.(b) That the following should be addedto the Cabinet Committee set upon March 2nd,  (Cabinet Ab&quot; (^2),Conclusion y) *&quot;The Prime Minister,The Lord President of the Council,The Secretary of State forForeign Affairs,and that the terms of reference should be extended to empower theCommittee &quot;to consider the irish situation that has now arisen, andto report to the Cabinet&quot;.NOTE:-   The composition of theCommittee is now as follows.: -The Prime Minister,The Secretary of State forDominion Affairs,The Lord President of the Council,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Home Secretary,The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The Secretary of State for War,The President of the Board of trade the Lord Privy Seal.
12f.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed theCabinet that the Board of Inland Revenue were onthe point of paying to the Irish Free State a sumof about  200,000 under the Agreements for the relief of Double Taxation.      Strictly speaking this amountwas due to the executors of the late Lord Iveagh,who were, under decisions of the Irish Free Statelegal tribunals, liable to pay it to the IrishExchequer.      Under the normal practice the transferwould fall to be made direct between the two Exchequers.In the view of the Inland Revenue the decision ofthe Irish Free State courts, under which the Iveaghfamily&apos;s liability had been established, was wrong,but the Iveagh family had no remedy against the IrishFree State, and once they paid they had a legal claimagainst the British Exchequer for recoupment.Although it was clear that the Irish Free State hadacted in such a way that they would receive underthe strict letter of the Taxation Agreements a sumof about  200,000,  to which they had no moral claim,the Chancellor recommended that, having regard tothe importance of avoiding even the shadow of asuggestion that we had hesitated to fulfil anagreement with the Irish Free State,  the InlandRevenue should be authorised to pay.The Cabinet approved theChancellor&apos;s recommendation.
NATIONAL POWERlANp TRANSPORT.[The Relationsbetween theICabinet and; outside-Ministers.(previous reference;Cabinet 18(52), Con-clusion J) .15.    The Secretary of State for Air informed theCabinet that a difficult situation had arisen in theHouse of Lords on the previous day, when criticismhad been directed against the composition of aCommittee of representatives of railway and roadinterests set up by the Minister of Transport,  onthe ground that representatives of Local Authoritiesought also to have been included.      The matter hadnot, he believed,  ever been discussed at the Cabinet,and he had had to deal with it in Debate at very short notice, and without any real knowledge ofthe subject.      A Government defeat  in the House ofLords had been only narrowly averted.      He suggested,therefore, that some organisation was necessaryto enable the Cabinet to keep in touch with questionsof transport policy.The Cabinet were reminded that in someGovernments arrangements had been made for thePresident of the Board of Trade to keep in close touch with transport questions when the Minister wasnot a Member of the Cabinet.The Prime Minister said that the presentunderstanding was that the Ministers outside theCabinet should consult him on questions of policy.He undertook to discuss the matter with the Ministeralsoof Transport; and to consider/whether any more detailed arrangements should be made for establishing closercontact between the Cabinet and Ministers at the-headof Departments who were not Members of the Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.23rd March, 1952.
APPENDIX(PRIVATE NOTICE QUESTION - Wednesday , S5rd March),CAPTAIN PETER MACDONALD to ask the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs ( a question of whichI have given him private notice)  if he has hada communication from the Irish Free State Govern-ment regarding that Government&apos;s attitude tov,rardsLand Purchase Annuities due to this country andother Treaty obligations, and if so what was thenature of his reply.I was officially informed yesterday by the HighCommissioner for the Irish Free State that, in theopinion of his Government, the Oath of Allegiance isnot mandatory in the Treaty, and that the Irish FreeState have an absolute right to modify their constitution as the people desire.It is manifest that the Oath is an integral partof the Treaty made ten years ago between the two countries and hitherto honourably observed on both sides.     We areaddressing to His Majesty*s Government in the Irish FreeState a communication which will make our standpointclear beyond a possibility of doubt.With regard to the land annuities, we havereceived no official communication from the Irish FreeState Government, but from a statement reported to havebeen made yesterday by Mr. de Valera in the Free StateSenate we understand that the Free State government propose to retain the Irish land annuities.
These annuities are payments which the tenants of purchased estates make in order to repay the sums lent to them to &quot;buy their land.      The IrishFree State Government are bound by the most formaland explicit undertaking to continue to pay the land annuities to the National Debt Gpmmissisners,  and thefailure to do  so would be a manifest violation ofan engagement which is binding In law and in honouron the Irish Free State9 whatever administration maybe in power5  in exactly the same way as the Treatyitself is &quot;binding on &quot;both Countries.
