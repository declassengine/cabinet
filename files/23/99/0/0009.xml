THE INTER- 1.    At a special Meeting held to review theNATIONALSITUATION.    present   position of  the negotiations with SovietRussia.(previous reference:Cabinet 28(39), Con-clusion 1. )Russia, the Cabinet had before them the following documents:-(1) A Note by the Secretary (CP. 116(39))circulating in accordance with theConclusion referred to in the margin -(a) The draft telegrams to His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Moscow, which were under consideration at the 47th Meetingof the Committee on Foreign Policy:(b) The draft Conclusions of the above-mentioned Meeting;(c) An Aide-Memoire by the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee (attached to the draft conclusions of the 47th Meeting ofthe Committee on Foreign Policy as appendix II):(2) A further Note by the Secretary (CP.115(39))circulating, by direction of the PrimeMinister,  the draft Conclusions of the 48thMeeting of the Committee on Foreign Policy:(3) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs (CP. . 123(39)), circulatingcopies of communications he had receivedindicating the views of the Canadian, SouthAfrican, New Zealand and Australian Governments;(4) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs (CP. 124(39)) containing an account of the latest developments in theAnglo-Soviet negotiations,  outlining thepossible alternative forms of agreement withthe Soviet Government, and setting out inparticular the relative advantages and disadvantages of an Anglo-Soviet Pact.Annexed to the Memorandum were two telegrams from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsgiving an account of his discussions with french Ministers in Paris on 20th May andreproducing the text of a draft Triple Pact(known as draft &quot;E&quot;,.)Attention was also drawn.in the memorandum to the misgivings of the Polish and RoumanianGovernments which had accordingly been asked,by telegram, for their views regarding a closer association between Great Britain and Franceand the Soviet Union.
THE PRIME MINISTER invited the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs to inform the Cabinet of *h9outcome of his conversations in Paris and Geneva inregard to the Anglo-Russian negotiations.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that the Cabinet would have seen the records ofhis discussions in Paris and at Geneva.      While theFrench were insistent that the negotiations with russia should not be allowed to break down, they were a gooddeal less interested in the form that the agreement withRussia should take.He had shown various alternative formulae toM. Daladier and he had at one time thought of asking the French Ministers to put one of these formulae toRussia as a suggestion of their own.      When, however,U* Daladier had said that if he did this he wouldprobably touch it up somewhat, he (the Foreign Secretary^,thought that it would be wiser not to authoriseM. Daladier to act and it was in this way agreed thatthe next step would be for M. Bonnet and the foreign secretary to explore the situation further with M. Maiskyat Geneva,The Foreign Secretary said that in had discussions with M. Maisky he had felt that M. Maiskywas no longer fencing with him.     Although he had used anumber of arguments and alternative proposals withM. Maisky, he had made no impression on him.      It was clear that M, Maisky&apos;s Government were mainly concernedwith the two following points:   first, they were not pre-pared to he put in a position of inequality as comparedwith the British, French and Polish Governments, whichhad concluded agreements on a reciprocal basis;    secondly,Russia feared that Roumania and Poland might collapseand that, if this happened, the condition which we made
that these countries should resist German, aggression     w *would not he fulfilled.     Russia would thus he leftface to face with Germany without any assurance of support from us..M. Maisky had made it plain that a fundamentalcondition of reaching any agreement with Russia was thatwe should agree that some form of triple relationshipshould he established between Great Britain, Prance and russia.     M. Maisky had said that if we were prepared toaccept this fundamental condition, the Russians would not prove difficult on other matters.The Foreign Secretary said that at one pointin the discussions he had told M. Maisky that he thoughtthat the Russian Government had been very tiresome duringthe negotiations..    This had elicited the response thatthe Russian Government had originally put up eightproposals;    that they had dropped five, and were now onlystanding out for the three points to which they attachedmost importance.Proceeding, the Foreign Secretary said that hewas satisfied that we were now faced with a clear choice ofalternatives.     He did not think he need repeat theadvantages and disadvantages of entering into an Anglo-Soviet Pact, which had been fully and repeatedly discussed and which were summarised in the Memorandum which he had submitted to the Cabinet (CP. 12h (39)).     There was greatforce in the view that, having gone so far in thenegotiations, a breakdown now would have a definitelyunfavourable effect.     He thought it was also true to saythat the difference between the proposal which the RussianGovernment had made to us and the counter proposal which wehad put forward - important though it was from the point ofview of principle - was not substantial enough to prevent anarrangement with Russia being made use of for propaganda purposes.     So far as he had been able to sift the- 3 -
available information, he thought that the ideaof some rapprochement between Germany and russia was not one which could be altogether disregarded.The Foreign Secretary said that it wasalso evident that the conclusion of an agreementbetween this country and Russia would facilitateour long-term arrangements with Turkey, whichmight otherwise give rise to certain difficulties.The replies which had been received from our ambassador at Warsaw and our Minister at Bucharest(Telegrams No. 173 from Warsaw and NoQ 223 fromBucharest) in response to the enquiries we had made (Telegram No. 105 to Warsaw and No. 232 toBucharest), showed that the Governments of thosecountries did not appear to see any great difficultyin the conclusion of an arrangement between thiscountry and Russia on the lines proposed by thelatter, provided that such an arrangement was concluded without those Governments respectivelybeing consulted or mentioned in the agreement,.The Foreign Secretary said that he had had interesting talks, while at Geneva, withM. Munters,  the Latvian Minister for ForeignAffairs, and with M. Holsti, the Finnish Ministerfor Foreign Affairs.     Mo Munters had suggestedmm
that the position of the Baltic countries might be eased if any arrangements reached betweenGreat Britain, Prance and Russia, whichcovered the Baltic States, took the form ofsome kind of guarantee of the neutrality of theBaltic States (see Telegram No0 11 L.N. from geneva).The Foreign Secretary said that hehad asked Mo Maisky whether the SovietGovernment would be prepared to agree that suchan arrangement as they were pressing should cover not only Eastern European States, but alsothe smaller Western European States (TelegramNo. 10 L.N. from Geneva).     M. Maisky had replied that he had no instructions from hisGovernment on this matter, but he did not anticipate that the answer to this question would give rise to any difficulty.Summing up the matter, the foreign secretary said that he had never disguised fromhis colleagues his own views on the subject ofa close association with the Russian Government.In present circumstances, however, he felt thatit was not possible to contemplate a breakdown of the negotiations, and that it was therefore necessary that we should be prepared to enterinto a direct mutual guarantee agreementwith the Soviet Government.
The question of presentation was, however,  ofgreat importance.    The Foreign Secretary then referred to asuggestion which had,  in the first instance, been madeby the Home Secretary at the Foreign Policy Committeeand which had since been considered by the Prime Ministerand by himself.    This was to link up the proposed arrange-ment with Russia with the Covenant of the League ofNations.The Foreign Secretary then read out a first draft indicating the form which the Agreement might take.After a declaration that France and Great Britain desiredto give effect to the obligations devolving on them underparagraphs 1 and 2 of Article XVI of the Covenant of theLeague of Nations,  it might be stated as follows:-&quot;if France and Great Britain are engaged in hostilities with a European Power,  in consequenceeither of aggression by that Power against another european State which has requested their assistance,  orof aggression by that Power against either of them, theU.S.S.R. will consider that the obligations devolvingon her under paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article XVI of theCovenant of the League of Nations have come into play,and will forthwith give France and Great Britain allthe support and assistance in her power, without waiting for the recommendations of the Council ofthe League.&quot;It might be objected that this invocation ofArticle XVI was somewhat unreal and that it would belikely to cause some irritation to Italy.
On the more general issue, the Foreign secretary said, in reply to a question, that he did not think thatthe difference between an arrangement on the lines nowproposed and an arrangement such as we had suggested tothe Russian Government was likely to &quot;be sufficient totip the balance and to provoke herr hitler into startinga war.   He thought that Herr Hitler   was  more likely tobe provoked into starting a war if we failed, as a resultof a breakdown with Russia, to oppose him with a solidbloc of States pledged to resist aggression.Some discussion ensued as to the obligations which russia should undertake in regard to a war starting in western Europe.    It was pointed out that the originalRussian proposal (Telegram No0 69 from Moscow of the18th April) contemplated a mutual agreement between england, France and Russia to render all manner ofassistance to each other in the event of aggression inEurope against any one of the contracting Powers.    Therewas, therefore, no provision in the original Russianagreement to cover the case of a German attack onSwitzerland or Holland as the result of which France, andthis country became involved in war with Germany.It was explained that we had never taken up thispoint in discussion with the Russian Government because we had not favoured an agreement on the lines of their proposal 0    The point was one which should be borne in mind.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, as his colleagues would be aware from the attitude which he had hithertoadopted in this matter, he viewed anything in thenature of an alliance with Russia with considerablemisgivings   He had some distrust of Russia&apos;s reliabilityand some doubt of her capacity to help   us in the event
of war.    Further, an alliance with Russia would arouseconsiderable opposition and objection in many quartersboth here and in the Dominions and in certain othercountries.He thought, however, that it must be recognised,after the statement made by the Foreign Secretary,that -unless we were prepared to agree substantially to proposals on the lines put forward by the RussianGovernment, we should have to fcog a breakdown in thenegotiations.    This would have a bad effect on publicopinion in Europe and it would be exploited by theTotalitarian Powers and would have a discouragingeffect on France and Turkey.     Moreover, the effectof a breakdown would be especially unfortunate comingso soon after the conclusion of the German-ItalianPact.In these circumstances, the Prime minister thought it was impossible to stand out againstthe conclusion of an agreement on the lines proposed.The question of presentation, however, was of theutmost importance and his (the Prime Minister&apos;s)difficulties would be greatly decreased if thesuggestion made by the Home Secretary could beadopted and the arrangement could be presented asan interpretation, in this particular instance, ofthe principles of the Covenant, rather on thelines of a regional Pact on the Locarno model underthe League of Nations.
The conclusion of an arrangement onthese lines would make matters much easier for those who saw strong opposition to an association between this country and Russia, but who would not feel the same objection to an arrangement withRussia under the Covenant of the League.The Prime Minister said that he did notthink that the conclusion of an arrangement on theselines was a mere facade.    Indeed, there was a realpoint of substance involved.    He referred to aletter in &quot;The Times&quot; that morning from Sir HenryPage Croft, in which the writer expressed hisdislike of a naked military alliance with Russiawhich might put a millstone round our necks for yearsand might result in our sons being called upon tofight for Russian interests.Again,  the Prime Minister said that roman catholic opinion all over the world was strongly opposed to an alliance with Russia.    roman catholic opinion would find it much easier toaccept an arrangement which took the form of a development of the Covenant of the League ratherthan of a military alliance.    Further, thearrangement suggested had far less of theappearance of a lining up of the Powers in anideological bloc than had the military allianceplan.
The Prime Minister saw no reason to suppose that an arrangement on the lines suggested would not he accepted by the RussianGovernment.     The Foreign Secretary in a speech at Geneva had referred to the Covenant of theLeague in terms which&quot;gave    a   lead in thedirection indicated.The Prime Minister also referred to a leading article in the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; that morning under the heading &quot;The Right Thing inthe Right Way&quot; which advocated the conclusion ofan agreement with Russia as a development of theCovenant of the League of Rations.In conclusion, the Prime Minister said thathe now favoured, in substance, the conclusion ofan agreement with Russia on the lines of her -proposals, but presented in the form which hadbeen outlined that morning.THE LORD CHANCELLOR asked whether thearrangement proposed should be for a fixed periodof,say, five years.THE PRIME MINISTER said that one reasonin favour of linking the arrangement with Russiawith Article XVT of the Covenant was that circumstances might arise in which that article of the Covenant might have to be revised.     Thisintroduced an element of a temporary characterinto the arrangement without specifically mentioninga time limit.     He was somevi/hat averse fromsuggesting a specific time limit.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS   :said that the Soviet proposal for a Triple Pacthad been for a period of from five to ten years
and that he anticipated no particular difficultyin obtaining-the insertion, of a time limit.     TheGerman-Italian Pact was for a period of ten years.THE HOME SECRETARY said that there was morerisk of an intrigue between Russia, and Germany ifa time limit were inserted.     On the general issuehe was convinced that, having gone so far, it wasimpossible to face a breakdown in the negotiations.He suggested that not only the Russian Agreementbut the other Agreements should be brought withinthe framework of the League of Nations.      otherwise there was a risk that Russia would think we were making some difference between her and the othercountries concerned.The Home Secretary said that he was notmoved by the argument that our attitude to article XVX of the Covenant was different from what it had been a year ago.     The whole circumstances had changed and we were now engaged in. organisinga peace bloc against aggression.     He thought thatthere was every argument for doing this under the auspices of the League of Nations.     Further, hethought that this procedure would be more likelyto commend the arrangement with Russia to publicopinion in Canada and South Africa.THE SECRETARY OP S TATE FOR AIR concurred in this view and also favoured the conclusion ofan agreement for a specified period of years.     he hoped, however, that undue importance would notbe attached to the military value of Russia.Mr. Arthur Greenwood, M.P. had recently published a pamphlet entitled &quot;The Soviet&apos;s Fighting Forces&quot;and he had obtained the comments of the Air Staffon this pamphlet.      In the Air Staffs view, although
numerically, the Soviet air force may well he.the largest air force in the world, it was unlikely to play a decisive part in a war in the near future,although it would constitute a considerable deterrent to any country contemplating aggression.   Again,reliable information showed that the russian aircraft industry had. failed, almost completely tokeep pace with foreign developments, so that theSoviet were now relying almost entirely uponAmerican productioxi for the replacing of theirfighter and. general purposes aircraft and flying boats.     As regards the Soviet army, the equipmentwas more noteworthy for quantity than for quality.THE SECRETARY OP STATE EOR DOMINI OH affairs said that he had. seen the High Commissioners ofthe Dominions on the previous day, and. had e^lainedto thein the present position in the negotiations.The High Commissioners for South Africa and canada had both said that if we were faced with a choice between a breakdov/n in negotiations and conclusion of an agreement on the terms proposedby the Russian Government they had. no    doubtthat their Governments would take the view that weshould conclude an agreement.     Broadly speaking,apart from New Zealand, all the Dominions appearedto dislike the idea of an agreement with Russiabut recognised,nevertheless, that having goneso far ir would be right to make an agreementrather than risk a complete breakdown.
THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCE saidthat he recognised that in this matter political considerations must over-ride military considerations,hut he thought it was clear that from &quot;both points ofview it was better to make an agreement with Russia onthe terms proposed, rather than to allow the negotiations to break downc     It was important, however, that weshould obtain full military benefit from the agreement and get complete reciprocity from the RussianGovernment.     The Minister referred to the statement inparagraph 13 of the paper circulated by the foreign secretary (C .P.124(39)) that Germany was irunable at themoment to embark on a war on two fronts&quot;0    He thoughtthat while Germany would be most unwilling to undertakesuch a    task, it was not correct to say that she was unable to do soBThe Minister then gave the Cabinet certainparticulars as to the progress of the staff conversations in regard to a war on two fronts0      (These particularsand the discussion thereon, are recorded in theSecretaryTs standard file of Cabinet Conclusions).The Minister, also referred to the importanceof making arrangements for1 adequate consultation before any Power to which we had given military undertakingscould take action which might involve us in war.       TheMinister suggested that when our Staff representatives had finished their conversations with the French Staffs,and when the staff conversations now proceeding in Warsawhad Come to an   end, it would be desirable that a
comprehensive Report on this question should he submitted to the Defence Plans (policy) Committee,After further discussion, the PRIMS ministers aid that he thought it was clear that theCabinet were prepared to approve action on thelines suggestedo     He asked the Foreign Secretaryto outline what procedure should now be followedto implement that policy,,Statement to THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSbe made in theHouse of said that he thought the Prime Minister would wishCommons.to make some statement in the House of commons that afternoono     We were not, of course in aposition to say that we had reached an agreementwith the Russian government      It might, however*be possible to use some words to the effect thatthe Prime Minister, after hearing a report fromthe Foreign Secretary, thought that no greatdifficulty need now be anticipated in thenegotiations with RussiaeIt was pointed out that if an announcement was made^Jun^ge^wsradr^ to be pressure for further details0      THE PRIME MINISTERhoped that an announcement could be made in such away as to obviate demands for further details.Perhaps the Foreign Secretary would be preparedto see the Leader of the Opposition on the matter.THE PRESIDENT OF THE B0A3D OF TRADE suggestedthat it would be desirable that our statement
should emphasise that we were not just accepting the proposals of the Russian Government in the formput to us, hut that we were putting up alternative proposals of our own.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs said that the next step would he to communicate with Sir William Seeds *     M. Maisky would he atGeneva for another two days, and he had left matterson the footing that the next step would he for a communication   to he made from London to Moscow,THE PRIME MINISTER asked whether it wouldhe necessary to consult with the French Governmentagain before communicating with the RussianGovernment.       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS thought this was hardly necessary as theonly point to which the French had attached supreme importance was that there should be no break-downin the negotiations.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs suggested that he should try for an arrangement for five years, with the alternative of ten years, if theRussian Government so preferred.THE PRC ME MINISTER said that he saw noobjection to a five-year period, but he would prefernot to be committed to a period of ten years.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIESsaw some advantage in the conclusion of an agreement for a different period to that embodied in the German-Italian Pactfr
Conclusionsof RegionalPacts underthe Leagueof Nations.Position ofthe baltic states.Arrangementsfor con-sultation.limitation to Europe.THE SECRETARY OF STATE POR FOREIGN affairs said that he proposed to endeavour to ensure that our arrangements with Poland and Turkey and the similar arrangement with Russia were concluded as developments of the Covenant of the League,    This might causesome difficulty with Poland,^^^gLK^of NatirThe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsattached considerable importance to consulting theBaltic States before saying anything as to theposition of these States to Russia0The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that he would endeavour to ensure the inclusion ofa Clause to cover the point raised by the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence, namely,  that there shouldbe adequate consultation before any Power took actionwhich might commit to war the other Powers partici-pating in the arrangements the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs referred to the provisions in the draft agreement that assistance should only be given if the victim of aggression resisted with all her forces,  and,  then only if it was desired,  and. in the most convenient form.He thought that the first of these provisions might give rise to some difficulty in the case of Holland,since even if Holland did not resist invasion, we should regard the invasion of Holland as an act whichwould involve us in war.In reply to a question by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, the Foreign Secretary said that nothing had.been specifically said as to whether theproposed arrangement should extend to the Far East.   .Hehad, however, on a previous occasion shown.M. Maisky
Sir Robert Vansittart&apos;s draft which had confinedthe proposed arrangement to Europe and M. Maisky had made no comment.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND emphasised the desirability of ensuring that we were properlyconsulted before any action was taken which might involve us in war.    This was even more important inregard to Russia than it was in the case of Poland.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEstressed in this connection the importance of a definition of what was meant by the phrase &quot;involvedin hostilities&quot;.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought a numberof these points were points which would prove to bemore relevant to the final Agreement than to thedeclaration which would be made at the outset.THE CABINET agreed:-(i) To authorise the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to proceed with thenegotiations with the Russian Govern-ment on the lines indicated in thediscussion, viz., the conclusion of anarrangement of mutual guarantee between france, Great Britain and Russia against aggression by Germany, the arrangementbeing expressed as a particular instanceof the implementing of our obligations under Article XVI of the Covenant ofthe League of Nations.(ii) To authorise an announcement being made inthe House of Commons that afternoon ingeneral terms, indicating that it was hoped to reach an agreement with   Russiaon the above lines.(iii) To authorise the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, in consultation&apos; withthe Prime Minister, to settle the terms and arrange for the despatch of a telegram with.M. Ambassador at Moscow offering to con-elude, an   arrangement with Russia on thelines indicated.    In the preparation of thedespatch regard should be had to thepoints brought out in the Cabinet discussion,
INTERNATIONAL 2.        THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRSSITUATION (Contd.)mentioned a suggestion which had emerged in theAngl o -Ge rmanRelations.(previous reference:Cabinet 26 (39)Conclusion 2)course of discussion with the High Commissionerson the previous day.      It had a good deal in common with the suggestion which the foreign secretary had recently made to the german ambassador.      The suggestion was that, when we hadstrengthened our position by making an agreementwith the Russian Government, we should take theinitiative in a renewal of the.search forappeasement.     When we had so strengthened ourposition as to have constituted the greatestpracticable deterrent against aggression, weshould be in a position to make such an approachfrom strength, and there was more likelihood thatGermany would, be willing to listen to us in such circumstances.      Our approach might take theform of indicating that we had no intention toencircle Germany economically and that we werereads&apos;- at any time to discuss any matters in dispute,An approach on these lines might be rejected, butif it was accepted it would constitute animportant step towards appeasement.     The foreign secretary in speaking to the German ambassador had suggested that Herr Hitler should take theinitiative, but he (the Dominions Secretary)doubted-Wbeihe^Herr-4RL^ so.     once we were in a sufficiently strong position, wecould afford to take the initiative ourselves.
THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OF TRADE said thatone difficulty was that many of the outstanding matters in which Germany was concerned involved concessions not by us hut by other countries.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, while he did notreject the suggestion put forward by the dominions secretary, he thought that it was premature to adopt it.It was necessary not merely that we should he strong,but that others should realise the fact.      Further,public opinion in this country was not ready for such a move at this juncture.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he had told the German Ambassador (though he had not recorded it in his Note) that he wasconscious that at present our policy might seem toresemble putting a notice on a plot of grass warningothers from treading on it and of the results if thiswas done.      He had added that there was, however, alsoa positive side to our policy.The Foreign Secretary said that he had under-taken to make a speech at Chatham House towards the endof June, and he suggested that this might be a suitable occasion on which to try to state the positive side ofour policy.The Cabinet took note of these statements.
UTTER-national situation.(Confd)Danz ig.(previous reference:Cabinet 27 (39)Conclusion 2. )I3.      THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that while at Geneva he had had some discussions with Herr Burckhardt.     There had also been a meetingof the League Committee of Three on Danzig of which he,as the United Kingdom Representative, was rapporteur.M.    Sandier who was also a member of the Committeehad at first adopted a somewhat difficult attitude,and had wished the League to wash its hands of danzig.     He had however been persuaded that Danzigwas a matter of considerable European importance and had changed his point of view.     It had beenagreed that Herr Burckhardt should be authorised toreturn to Danzig from which he had been absent for two or three months and that he should spend two orthree days at Warsaw en route.     After spending afew days at Danzig he should then proceed to Berlinin his private capacity.     It seemed likely thatthere was a good prospect that Herr Burckhardt mightbe able to achieve some useful work during thesevisits.     He was then due to return to Switzerlandto attend a function and it had been arranged for anofficial of the Foreign Office to go to Switzerland tomeet him.Herr Burckhardt had informed the foreign secretary that three days earlier he had received a communication from the German Consul General atGeneva who, speaking quite clearly on instructions from the German Government, had said that the GermanGovernment would be glad if Herr Burckhardt would return to Danzig.     Words had also been used by theGerman Consul General to imply that it was unlikelythat Herr Burckhardt would find the situation inDanzig embarrassing to him.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY thought that.this wasencouraging.
THE HOME SECRETARY thought that the Cabinet ought notto exclude the possibility of the situation in Danzigdeteriorating.    The most likely possibility, was a violentoutbreak in the town as the result of gunmen having been brought in from outside.    An obscure situation might well result, andhe thought the Cabinet ought to consider what action they shouldtake in such a contingency.     Would it not be well towork outalternative plans to deal with such an event, as, for example,whether the Fleet should be mobilised, or economic sanctionsapplied?In the discussion which ensued it was suggested that iftrouble arose at Danzig the matter was one primarily for theCouncil of the League.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that herr Burckhardt had been very insistent that, if any opportunity arose for negotiation, it was essential that direstnegotiations should take place between Germany and Poland,THE HOME SECRETARY said that he was anxious thata decision should be reached as to what military steps should be taken if a sudden emergency arose, in order tohold the situation,THE MINISTER FOR GO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE referred inthis^connection to_a.jieci-si.on__announced at the 555th Meetingof the Committee of Imperial Defence, that if it was proposed at any time to take emergency measures,   the question of whataotion should be taken by the three Services should beconsidered at a meeting of the Defence Ministers, and theForeign&apos; Secretary or a representative of the Foreign Officeand \he &quot;Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, presided overby the PjVime Minister, or the Minister for Co-ordinationOf Defends.    There was also the. question of consultation withthe French as to the action which should be taken.    Events inDanzig might, move very quickly, and the necessary consultationsand discussions might take so long that we might well find
ourselves faced with a fait accompli.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought the essentialpoint at issue was a political problem, namely, if troubleflared up in Danzig, what steps could be taken to hold thesituation politically.   While the Foreign Secretary hadbeen at Geneva, he had had some discussion with the ForeignOffice as to enlisting the aid of the Scandinavian countriesin this matter.    He understood that a telegram had been dispatched to Warsaw to enquire if the Polish Governmentwould see any objection to the Scandinavian countries beingsounded in regard to it.   He thought that attention shouldbe directed to political activities to secure a breathing-space, rather than to military measures.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thathe was afraid that the Scandinavian countries would be unwilling to take any steps in this matter.    He had spoken to the French Ministers on the subject.   .M. Daladier had expressed the view that Signor Mussolini was alreadyexercising a restraining influence, and that the influence of the Vatican might also be of assistance.The Foreign Secretary also reported the results of aomeremarks which Herr Hitler was stated to have made quiterecently which indicated that Herr Hitler was not intending anysudden action in regard to Danzig.    It was perhaps worthremembering that Herr Hitler was an Austrian, and that therelations between the Austrians and the Poles were traditionallymuch better than relations between the North Germans and thePoles.The Foreign Secretary said that he would consider, inconsultation with the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence andthe Service Ministers, whether there were any precautionary measures   which could be taken to meet the contingency of somesudden emergency in Danzig.The Cabinet took note of this statement.- 22 -
much alarmed at the position and strongly pressed,on political grounds, that our troops should bemore in eviolence.     Mohammed Mahmoud Pashawas willing that a Brigade of Infantry should besent from India, and he (the Foreign Secretary) had asked the Secretary of State for War and theSecretary of State for India to consider thissuggestion.     He was informed that the cost ofthis move would be some  20,000, and the suggestion had been made that Egypt should be asked to paythis sum.     As, however, it was fortunate from our point of view that the Egyptian Governmentshould press us to keep more troops in thatcountry than were allowed under the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, he hoped that the financial aspect of the matter would not be pressed.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that themost convenient and economical method of reinforcingEgypt would be to move the Middle East ReserveBrigade from Palestine to Egypt.     If this v/eredone there would remain 12 Infantry Battalions inPalestine - a number which was adequate in theGeneral Staffs view.     He emphasised that,EGYPT. 4.

TheBritish military authorities in Egypt were urgentlyinsistent that action should be taken in this matter.This statement was supported by the Secretaryof State for Air.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES saidthat he would not object to the move of the middle east Brigade from Palestine to Egypt if the HighCommissioner for Palestine and General Hainingagreed to this course.     He thought it was somewhatdoubtful whether they would be prepared to&apos; agreeat this moment, or whether they would be willingto give an assurance that they would not againrequire the services of this Brigade in the nearfuture.     He suggested that no decision should betaken until the High Commissioner and General Haininghad been consulted.The Cabinet took note of the statement made by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, and invited theSecretary of State for the colonies to enquire whether the High Commissionerfor Palestine and General Haining wereprepared to agree to the move of theMiddle.,East Reserve Brigade from palestine to Egypt.
THE CABINET. 5.      THE PRIME MINISTER said that,  subjectto any unforeseen happening, there would be noMeeting of the Cabinet on Wednesday, the31st May.     The present intention was that thenext Meeting of the Cabinet should be held onWednesday, the 7th June, at 10.30 a.m.The Cabinet took note of this statement.Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1.2kth May, 1939.
NO CIRCULATION.MOST SECRET. CABINET 50(59),  ITEM (l).THE INTER-   . THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE saidNATIONALSITUATION,   that in the course of the Anglo-French Staff Conversa-tions held on the 3rd. May there had been discussionsRUSSIA.as to what action should be taken if Germany stoodstrictly on the defensive in the West while attackingPoland in the East.    According to the French representatives at the Conversations,  the intention of the French wasthat they would stand on the defensive on the maginot line,  and would aim at building up a concentration whichcould take the offensive against Italy.    But what would the position be if Italy were neutral?    The french delegation had said that,  if Belgium were in the war,the French would probably be prepared to undertake an offensive through that country:    but that, if Belgiumstayed out of the war,  there was nothing to be doneagainst the Siegfried Line.    The Delegation emphasised,however,  that they had received no express instructions on this particular contingency, and had undertaken to consult their Higher Authorities and communicate with us again.    Meanwhile the Chiefs of Staff were considerablydisturbed at the prospect of complete inaction on thepart of the French against Germany, and the consequentfailure to exploit the two-front war: and they werein process of preparing a report on the subject.    Ifthe French were going to do nothing to draw off the weight of the German attack on Poland, the assistanceof Russia would be of great value to the latter.The Minister said that he had in mind, theclassic example of 1914.    In that case Russia invaded east prussia, with the result that Germany withdrew two army corps from her Western to her Eastern Front and therebylost the Battle of Marne.    It was important that the strategy to be employed in a two-front war should be
further considered in the Staff Conversations with theFrench.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said that,  inview of the remarks of the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence, the strategical situation was somewhatdisquieting, and was unpleasantly reminiscent of thesituation last September.    If the French sat on theMaginot Line and did not carry out any offensive operations,  in what way should we be able to giveeffective help to our allies?THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE saidthat the discussions between the French and British Staffson the matter were still in a fluid state, and he was anxious that nothing should be said on the matter untilGeneral Gamelin had been further consulted by.the FrenchStaff representatives.    A suggestion had been made that,if the French remained on the defensive, it might conceivably be advisable for us to force a two-front war on Germany by attacking her in the air, &quot;with the gloves off&quot;.THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR AIR said that the apparent attitude of the French Government as thusrevealed was what he had always suspected.    He noted thatthe French aircraft figures showed that 85 per cent,of the present output were fighters, and 5 per cent,bombers,  the rest being training and such types.    it looked as though,  if there were an air offensive in theWest, we should have to carry it out almost single handed.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE askedwhether an offensive carried out by a weaker millitary power against a stronger military Power was likely to beprofitable.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE  saidthat we could certainly carry out an effectiveoffensive ifBelgium was involved in the war.
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs thought that the fact that this was the case meant thatGermany would, he less likely to attack Belgium if she was determined to stand on the defensive in the West.
