1.      THE SECRETARY OP STATS FOR FOREIGN affairs said that his colleagues would have seen the telegramfrom our Ambassador at Moscow (Noo 87)? giving an account of his interview with Mo Molotov on the8th May, when he had communicated the British Government &apos;reply to the Soviet government     The Foreign secretary thought that the tone of this interview did not soundtoo promising^The Foreign Secretary added that on theprevious afternoon he had seen M. Maisky, who had saidthat he had been instructed by his Government topoint out that the arrangement which we proposed wasnot a reciprocal one.      In the course of some friendlydiscussion on this point the Foreign Secretary had replied that if the Soviet Government felt any doubt on this point it might perhaps be as well that theyshould submit their doubts in writings      He had told M. Maisky that he had every confidence that he couldconvince the Soviet Government that there was some misunderstanding on the point, or that we could satisfytheir doubts in some other way       His impression ofthis interview had been that perhaps the SovietGovernment were, after all, prepared to accept theidea of a unilateral declaration^In the course of discussion reference wasmade to the statement which had been issued in moscow in regard to the negotiations, and which had appeared in the Press that morning.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs agreed that the issue of this statement .,would not make matters any easier.      He had the impression that therewas some element of mi sunder- standing between the two
parties.     Thus, the Russians thought that they were likely to he involved in war with Germany incircianstances in which we should not he involved.He (the Foreign Secretary) had tried to explain that,so far as concerned a war arising out of an attack on poland or Roumania, and in which Russia was involved,we should certainly also be involved.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said that,judging from the terms of the S-tigfcemantk tike-.-Russian .Government&apos;s contention was that, if they were to give an undertaking to the Baltic States they might become involved in war while we stood aside.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that his discussion with M. Maisky had beenspecifically directed to the case of war arising out of aggression against Poland and Roumania.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS suggestedthat it might be desirable that the Foreign secretary should invite M. Molotov to meet him at Geneva tocontinue the discussions.     He was more and moreimpressed by the serious consequences which would ensuefrom a breakdown of the negotiations.In reply to questions, the FOREIGN secretary said that he had no information bearing on the likelihood of some secret agreement &quot;being concluded between herr hitler and M, Stalin.     He found it difficult to attachmuch credence to these reports, which might be spreadby persons who desired to drive us into making a pactwith Russia,As regards Staff Conversations, he had giventhe matter some consideration. While he thought thata position might be reached in which we should have to start Staff Conversations with Russia, he would prefer
to postpone this as long as possible,      He did not,however, in any way exclude the possibility of staff conversations,In reply to THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE,who asked whether there was not some danger in trying toget Russia to make an arrangement too much on our ownterms, THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he agreed as to the importance of avoiding a breakdown in the negotiations.      He thought it right that our policyin this matter should be guided by the circumstances which arose from day to day.     He reminded his colleagues ofthe importance of maintaining good relations with Spain.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE saidthat he had asked the Chiefs of Staff to reportoh thebalance of strategical value to us in war of having Spainas an enemy or Russia as an ally.     He had received an advance copy of this Report,      Broadly, the view of theChiefs of Staff was as followso     The active enmity of spain would greatly weaken our position in the western mediterranean and would threaten our Atlantic communications.On the other hand, Spain was suffering from war-weariness,and a blockade of her coasts would, in the long run, bringher to a stand-stilloIf Russia were an active and whole-hearted ally,she would be of great assistance, particularly incontaining substantial enemy forces and in supplying warmaterial to our other allies in Eastern Europe.      But, onthe assumption that if Russia was not with us, she was atleast neutral, the Chiefs of Staff thought that theadvantages of an alliance with Russia would not offset the disadvantages of the open hostility of Spain.      Onthe other hand, the greatest danger- we had to face would bea combination of Russia and the Axis Powers.
THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that this Report,when completed, should he circulated to the Cabinet.In the course of discussion THE SECRETARY of state POR THE COLONIES and THE MINISTER without portfolio also favoured the suggestion that M. Molotovor M. Potemkin should be invited to Geneva to continuethe negotiations there.The Cabinet -(1)    took note of the statement by theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs as to the course of the negotiationswith Soviet Russia:(2)    requested the Prime Minister and theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs to consider further the question whetherM. Molotov or Mo Potemkin should beinvited to Geneva to continue thenegotiations there:(3)    invited the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence to arrange for the circulation to the Cabinet of the Report by theChiefs of Staff on the balance ofstrategical value in war as between Spainas an enemy, and Russia as an ally.
THE INTER- 2.      THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGNNATIONALSITUATION       AFFAIRS said that a certain amount of information(Confd. )had  been received to the effect that the 10th toDanzig. the 24th May would constitute a danger period in(Previous regard to Danzig.    It had been stated that theReferenceCabinet 26     Prague racket had been started in Danzig, but it(39), Con-clusion 3.)   was well to bear in mind that circumstances inFR 30(39)3       Danzig were different from those in Czechoslovakia.The Foreign Secretary thought that the mostprobable   development v/ould be that we should hearone morning that the Danzig Senate had decreed anAnschluss with the Reich.    Accordingly, he had sent a telegram to Poland the previous day (TelegramNo. 151 to Warsaw) to ascertain what action colonel beck would take if this happened.    He had includedin this telegram a general suggestion that if this happened, Poland&apos;s reply might be to use theeconomic weapon by deflecting her trade from Danzigto Gydnia.    This v/ould give time for consideration before any irrevocable action v/as taken.If Germany sent armed forces into Danzigand interfered with the Polish customs and so forth,a more serious situation would arise.    A telegram had accordingly been sent to our Ambassador inBerlin (Telegram No.150) suggesting that he shouldtalk to General Keitel, the Commander-in-Chief,and/or to Vtne Chief of the German Staff and point out to them what this step v/ould involve.    A telegram in similar terms had been sent to our ambassador in Rome (Telegram No.239) suggesting that he shouldtalk in the same sense in Court and Army circlesin Rome.
M.Blum&apos;s THE LORD PRIVY SEAL referred to theConferenceswith Labour somewhat alarming reports of the situation whichOppositionLeaders.       he understood M. Blum had given to the Leaders ofthe Labour Opposition implying that a crisis was imminent...THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGNAFFAIRS said that he thought these rumours probablyrelated to the situation in Danzig.    There was, ofcourse, a good deal of information which pointed to the possibility of trouble arising out of Danzigin the near future.The Cabinet took note of the ForeignSecretary1s statement.
THE INTER -national situation(Cont&apos;d.)VaticanProposalfor aConference.R/?. 2* (3*7)1..3.      THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said -that the Pope had now made his demarche.    an interim reply to our enquiry had been received from our Ambassador at Warsaw, and it was understood thatthe Polish Government&apos;s reply would be made that day.The French Government were not at all infavour of the Vatican&apos;s proposal and it was understood that they wished to reject it.    TheFrench were also unwilling to accept our counterproposal to the effect that instead of a FivePower Conference, the Pope should offer his goodservices to each pair of countries concerned, thatis to France and Italy, and to Germany and Polandrespectively.The Foreign Secretary thought that theoutlook for the Pope&apos;s proposal was not hopeful,and he felt in some doubt as to what action wecould usefully take in the matter.The Cabinet took note of this statement.
is INTER- 4. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSElONALITUATION. said that negotiations with Turkey were proceedingioNTD.)1__ satisfactorily.     The Turkish Government had repliedinver sat ionsIth Turkey.       to our proposals a few days ago and we had sent themFR. 2.4     J2.. a further telegram (No. 161 to Angora) dealing mainly with drafting points hut covering two points of substances(l)   ?/e had been anxious that the c asus f oederisshould be an act of aggression leading to war in theMediterranean.     The Turkish Government had omitted thewords &quot;leading to war&quot; and we had asked them to agree.to these words being re-inserted.     It was important for us to be certain of turkey co-operation not only if an act of aggression were committed actually withinthe Mediterranean area but also if one were committedoutside that area which led to a general, conf ragrationinvolving H.M. Government in war with Italy.55(2)    The declaration in the form proposed by turkey had made no mention of the Balkans.     In our view,this omission would be regarded as a sign of weakness andwe had suggested adding the following words -The two Governments recognise that it isalso necessary to insure theestablishment of security in the balkans and they are consultingtogether with the object of achieving this purpose as speedily as possible&quot;.The Foreign Secretary said that he had just received a telegram from Turkey (No. 206 from Angora)to the effect that the Turkish Government agreed to thesetwo proposals and were anxious to make the declarationbetween two and four pemc that afternoon.       There was,h   Note:    A later telegram shows that theommision of the words in question was due to an error in cypheringonly.
however a further outstanding point viz. that theFrench were anxious to he included in the agreement which would thus become tripartite.     We, on theother hand, favoured a bilateral agreement betweenGreat Britain And Turkey and thought that theFrench and the Turks might conclude a similarbilateral agreement.     We had, therefore, told theTurkish Government that we could not agree to anannouncement being made that afternoon..     an endeavour would be made to ensure that theFrench Government made a separate bilateral agree-ment on the same lines as our agreement with theTurkish GovernmentoIn the course of discussion, generalagreement was expressed with the view that a bilateral agreement was preferable to the tripartite agreement proposed by the French Government,The view was also expressed that thedeclaration should be made in the course of thepresent week.      THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said he hoped that the declaration would be published onFriday next, 12th May.The Cabinet took note of this statement and agreed that anyfurther question arisingout of the Anglo-Turkishnegotiations should be remitted to the meeting of the ForeignPolicy Committee to be heldat too p.m. that afternoon.
elusion 4.)puzzling.     Thus, a few days previously M. Corbinhad informed him, in reply to a question, thatno steps were being taken with regard to the resump-tion of Franco-Italian negotiations.        A  telegramfrom Paris (No. 268), however, relating to the conference proposed by the Pope, (and in particular to our suggestiotsthat the Pope might make a separate approach to Franceand Italy in regard to Franco-Italian differences)contained a statement to the effect that, M. Bonnethad assured our Ambassador, that the Franco-Italian discussions would probably proceed satisfactorily.The Cabinet took note of this statement.INTER- 5 e THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSNATIONALSITUATION reminded his Colleagues that he was going to Geneva(CONTD.)on Saturday, 13th May, for the meeting of the CouncilItalianrelations of the League of Nations and would leave Geneva on the with France,night of Tuesday, 16th May.     He proposed to speak to(previous reference: M&apos;.,   Daladier on 13th May about Franco-ItalianCabinet (24(39), Con- relations,,     The present position was somewhat
INTER- 6. In reply to questions, the SECRETARY OF STATENATIONALSITUATION POR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that he had no more(CONTD.)information on this matter than had appeared in the Italo-Germanpact. Press.     He douhted whether the Pact made any realchange in the situation. We had always beeninformed by the Axis Powers that the Axis wasunbreakable. He had no confirmation of the reportthat Italy had pressed Germany not to take actionover Poland which would result in war, hut hethought it was quite likely that Italy had infact exercised some such pressure.The Cabinet took note of this statement.
PALESTINE.Draft white paper.(previous reference cabinet 26(39), Con-clusion 5).Position ofthe Mufti andof deportees.Date ofpublicationof theWhite Paper.7. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLO$f*^said that the Palestine Committee had now agreed on a revised text of the White Paper.    It hadnot been possible to circulate this revisedtext before the meeting of the Cabinet, butcopies would be circulated as soon as they wereavailable0The  Secretary of State for the colonies said that it would be necessary to answer questions in Parliament as to our attituderegarding the  return to Palestine:(a) of the Mufti.(b) of certain Arab deportees.The Colonial   Secretary read out the text of two draft replies which had been agreed with departmental representatives.    (Copies ofthese questions and answers are appended to these conclusions as   Appendix I.)The Cabinet agreed to the proposed draftreplies which would be given on the same dayas the White Paper was published.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR THE COLONIESreminded his colleagues of the main arguments onthis matter.    On the Arab side, the representativesof the neighbouring Arab States had now receivedour answers to the further points which they had raised.    They had not reacted strongly to theseanswers, and he had the impression that theEgyptian Prime Minister Mohammed Mahraoud wasfairly well reconciled to the position.    It seemed unlikely, however, that the representatives of anyof the neighbouring Arab States would come outpublieJy in support of our policy.
Turning to the other side of the picture,the Colonial Secretary said that the Prime Minister -.....   Iand himself had seen Mr. Attlee and Mr. Greenwoodthe previous day.   The Leaders of the labour opposition had urged postponement of the publicationof the White Paper until after Whitsuntide on theground that, from the Jewish side, our proposals would meet with strong and protracted opposition.Dr. Weizmann was returning to this country, andit had been arranged that he should see the PrimeMinister on Thursday, 11th May.    He would no doubtsay that our proposals would give rise to considerableoutbreak of Jewish violence in Palestine which he wouldnot be able to restrain.The Secretary of State for the Coloniesread out a telegram which he had received from our high Commissioner reporting on the situation. (Acopy of this telegram is annexed to these conclusions as Appendix II.)   He did not think this telegram could in any way be regarded as indicating that the High Commissioraer had altered his views as to the desirability of early publication of theWhite Paper, which he had consistently urged.The Secretary of State for the Colonies saidthat he had discussed the matter with the american ambassador, who had been in a somewhat gloomy mood,and had thought that the publication of the white paper would not make much difference to a situationwhich was already difficult.    The Jews, in his view,were unpopular in America, but he thought they mightbe able to work up a certain amount of anti-Britishagitation;    the results of which would not,however, last for very long.
It was necessary in considering the effects of publication of the White Paper on publicopinion in the United States to bear in mind theforthcoming visit of the King and Queen.     TheAmerican Ambassador had taken the view that publication in the near future would not have any effect on the King and Queen1s visit.     Hehad taken the view, however, that the applicationof conscription to Ulster might have resulted inthe working up of a considerable Irish agitation in the United States.On the other hand, if publication of theWhite Paper were now to be postponed, theSecretary of State thought it would probably benecessary that the postponement should be for aconsiderable time,  that is to say until after theconclusion of Their Majesties&apos; visit to theUnited States.There was also the consideration that ifpublication of the White Paper was to be furtherpostponed, the Arabs who knew that the Paper was ready for publication would become very suspiciousand would take the view that Jewish influenceswere at work to secure modification in their favour of our proposals.     The time-table whichhe had in mind was as follows:-Evening of Monday, .15th May.    Copies in the vote Office for Members of Parliament.Morning of Tuesday, 16th May.    Publication ofthe White Paper in the Press.Friday, 19th May.    Broadcast talk by theSecretary of State for the Colonies.Week beginning Monday, SSnd. May.    Debate inthe House of Commons.- Ik -
In discussion the view was expressed that this time-table allowed rather too longa period to elapse before there was any effective opportunity of answering the criticisms of our policy, especially fromthe Jewish side.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out thatthe whole of the ensuing week would be occupied with the Military Bills, and thatthe Opposition Leaders had made the point that they were anxious that a Debate on palestine policy should take place at theearliest date after publication of the white paper.     He suggested that it might bedesirable to postpone publication until, say,Wednesday, the 17th May.THE MINISTER OP HEALTH favoured some british Guiana: postponement of publication.     He pointed outRefugee settlement in. that we were now working on the proposalsfor settlement of refugees in British Guianaand that it was desirable to press forward asfar as possible with this scheme before theWhite Paper on Palestine was published.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE colonies said that the Report of the British GuianaRefugee Commission was to be published that afternoon and it was hoped that the government statement on the Report could be made onThursday, the 11th May.
THE HOME SECRETARY said that thismatter had been discussed in considerable detail at a meeting on the previous dayof the Committee on the Refugee problem.The main conclusions reached were as follows -First, that it was desirable that a government statement on the matter should be made as soonas possible.      Secondly, that this statement should show our strong interest in the scheme,and    should make it clear that we wereprepared to facilitate the scheme in every possible way.The Home Secretary added that he was satisfied that the Government should makea statement which definitely favoured thescheme and which made clear that the schemeincluded the possibilities of settlement on a really large scale.     He thought thatthe statement should also make it clearthat if the initial settlement was successfulwe were prepared to make available a largerarea for settlement and to accord aconsiderable measure of autonomy in localgovernment to the area to be settled.
It was true that the Royal Commission on the west indies thought that the Report was rather over optimisticand this view was shared in certain other quarters.    TheHome Secretary thought, however, that the Report was avery competent document, and that an experiment insettlement should now be made both on an industrial andon an agricultural basis.From the point of view of this country, it was important that this experiment should be made.    Largenumbers of young refugees were now coming into thiscountry on the basis that they only entered as trans-migrants.    It was in our interests to press forward withthis scheme.,THE PRIME MINISTER thought that it was important that the Government statement on the British GuianaRefugees Commission&apos;s Report should be published well inadvance of the publication of the White paper.    This wasagreed to.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES gave an outline of the points which virould be included in theGovernment statement.    First9 the work of the commission would be commended,,    Second, we should state that HisMajesty&apos;s Government welcomed the experimental settlement and that we hoped a beginning could be made in Octoberof the present year.    Third, we would provide facilitiesfor a survey to test the possibilities of industrialdevelopment in other parts of British Guiana.    Fourth, ifthe scheme was a success, we should be prepared to make available for the pattlcm^nl of refugees a much larger

Second, we should state that HisMajesty&apos;s Government welcomed the experimental settlement and that we hoped a beginning could be made in Octoberof the present year.    Third, we would provide facilitiesfor a survey to test the possibilities of industrialdevelopment in other parts of British Guiana.    Fourth, ifthe scheme was a success, we should be prepared to make available for the settlement of refugees a much larger
part of British Guiana.    In effect we should probablybe prepared to make available practically the wholecolony except the coastal belt.    Fifth, if the scheme of settlement proved a success, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould accept financial responsibility for arterialcommunications to the coast.THE CHANCELLOR OR THE EXCHEQUER said that he thought the Report must be regarded as holding out prospects of settlement of refugees on a really large scale.   At thesame time, the possibilities of the scheme must first be tested by an experimental scheme.    Pie thought it was right, however* that we should say now that, if large-scale settlement proved to be practicable, we would makeourselves responsible for the cost of the arterialcommunications to the coast.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH said that the scheme depended on co-operation with interests in the United States, andit was most important that the scheme should not be started off in an atmosphere of bitterness on the part ofthe Jewish leaders against this country.    He thoughtthat the British Guiana scheme would also commend itself tothe Arabs, since, unless some other area was made availablefor Jewish settlement the Jews would inevitably find their way into Palestine.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thatif this argument was brought forward as favouringpostponement of the publication of the White Paper, it wasalso necessary to bear in mind the bad effect of any suchpostponement on the ArabsP
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES said that^/opinion in the United States would be favourably impressed by the British Guiana schemep and that it was desirablethat this scheme should be made known a day or two before publication of the Palestine White Paper.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he entirely agreed with the view expressed by the Colonial Secretary,, thatthe Arabss who were an intensely suspicious people, would lose faith in us if we help d up publication of the. white paper.After further discussion, the Cabinet, agreed -(l) That the Government Statement on british guiana should be published, if possible.,on Thursday, 11th May.    This statement should include the main points outlined by the Colonial Secretary, and should emphasise the large possibilities of thescheme:(2) That the following time-table shouldprovisionally be adopted for publicationof the White Paper on Palestine :-Evening of Wednesday. 17th May:    Copiesin the Vote Office for Members ofParliament.Morning; of Thursday. 18th May:    Publicationof the White Paper in the Press.Friday. 19th May:    Broadcast talk by theSecretary of State for the Colonies.Week beginning Monday. 22nd May:    debate in the House of Commons.(3) That the Secretary of State for the colonies should have discretion to bring forward by24 hours the programme in (2) if he foundthat publication of the White paper on aThursday presented serious difficultiesin Palestine.

The draftBill had been referred to the various Associations ofLocal Authorities, and to the Government departments and other bodies concerned, and a number of minor amendments had been made to meet their views.     Ifpassed, the Bill would effect a considerablesimplification of the law and would be of great value to statutory water undertakers, to local authorities,and to the general public.
