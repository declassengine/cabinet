DEATH OF THE 1. THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was the R.T.. HON. sir philip SASSOON. practice on the death of any member of theCabinet, for a letter of condolence to besent from the Cabinet to his relatives.Sir Philip Sassoon, while not a member of theCabinet, had held a very exceptional positionand, moreover, had been a close personal friend of many members of the Cabinet.     The PrimeMinister thought that the Cabinet Would wish thathe should send a letter, on behalf of the Cabinet,to Sir Philip&apos;s sister.The Cabinet expressed approvalof this course.
THE international situation:Russia.(previous reference:-Cab. 30(39),Conclusion 1. )2. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS said that the Cabinet would have seen the reply sent by the Soviet Government to our proposals (Telegram No.l 14 from Moscow).     this telegram, and the possible lines of reply to it,had been discussed at a meeting of the ForeignPolicy Committee on Mondays 5th June.     Themost important point was. perhaps3 the soviet governments desire to deal with the outstanding questions in regard to guarantees by setting outby name the countries to whom our guaranteesshould extend.      This proposal involved twodifficulties.     First, that a number of theStates concerned did not wish to be named insuch a list.      Secondly, that the catalogue of states given by the Soviet Government did not include Holland or Switzerland.      The upshot ofthe proposal was therefore9 that, while we were called upon to guarantee all Russia&apos;s westernneighbours j Russia would not guarantee all thecountries neighbouring upon us.      In regard toreciprocity,, therefore, the original position had become reversed.The fact remained, however, that theSoviet Government felt that they were liable tobe threatened, as a result of one of the neighbouring -Baltic States opening its backdoor
to Germany;    and he thought that we should endeavour to meet this point of view withoutforcing our guarantee upon States unwilling toreceive it.     He had little doubt that theproblem was one which could be solved withgoodwill on both sides.The Foreign Policy Committee had also been impressed by the undesirability of continuing todeal with the matter by an interchange of telegrams.The course which had met with the greatest measureof approval had been that Sir William Malkin, theLegal Adviser to the Foreign Office,, should goto Moscow to explain the draft and to answer any counter arguments put up by the Soviet represen-tatives.     He, the Foreign Secretary, had expressed certain reserves about this proposal.We v/ere in the middle of difficult negotiationswith Poland and the final agreement with Turkeyremained to be drafted.     If Sir William Malkinwent to Moscow he might be absent for two orthree weeks and his chief legal assistant was ill.In the circumstances9 he had felt obliged to tell the Prime Minister that he did not think that sir William could be spared from London, and hehad asked the Prime Minister*s approval to sir william Seeds being recalled to London toreceive further instructions.     On the PrimeMinister&apos;s consent he had sent a telegram on theprevious day to Sir William Seeds in this sense.
It was also proposed that Sir Eric Phippe shouldhe invited to come over for consultation at thesame time in order to avoid a delay in regard to negotiations with the French Government.   Theforeign Secretary concluded by referring to telegram No. 221 from Paris, reporting the viewsof the United&apos; States -Ambassador in Paris as tothe Russian negotiations.   This was that an.agreement with us was necessary for the Russianstout that we should not reach it if we gave them the impression that we were running after them.In the course of discussion, the foreign secretary explained that the point of view advanced by Mr. Bullitt was, he thought, a good reasonagainst sending a Minister to Russia.   He d.id notthink the recall of Sir William Seeds would giverise to delay.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that there wasno certainty that the despatch of a further telegram would be more successful than our previousendeavovirs to reach an agreement with Russia, unless we made further efforts to ensure that the position was very thoroughly explained to the Russians bysomeone fully conversant with recent developments of our policy.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he proposed toinform the House of Commons of the action takenin regard to the recall of Sir William Seedsin the course of the afternoon.The Cabinet took note of these statements and approved the action taken.
THE INTER -national situation(Confd. )Franco-TurkishNegotiations.(previous reference:Cabinet 28(39), Con-clusion 2).3.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he understood from French sources that negotiations with Turkey over Hatay were likelyto be concluded in the course of a few days.    Itwas true that, from the Turkish side, we hadbeen informed not long ago that negotiations had reached a deadlock largely as a result of theFrench having demanded a cession of certainArmenian villages.    It was now understood, however,that these demands were not likely to be pressed.The Cabinet took note of this statement.
THE INTERNATIONAL 4. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSSITUATION. (Confd.)said. that, there was still no progress to report in italian Rela-tions with france.(previous reference:Cabinet 28(39)? Con-conclusion ion 3 *)regard to discussions between France and Italy.It was anomalous that, at a time when the French and ourselves were constantly saying that we were preparedto settle matters by negotiation rather than by force,the French       Government should refuse to take any action in regard to the discussion of Italian claims.He understood that the Prirae Minister was considering whether he should send, a personal letter to M. Da.la.dierurging him strongly to agree to discussions with italy.    There was every good, reason why France should agree to discuss outstanding differences with Italy,and. it were.1 eise-ea? that Ita.ly would respond tp&amp;gsjfavourably to any overtures from France,The Cabinet took note of the above statement.
kg INTERNATIONALgelations withtaly.previous reference:Cabinet 19(39), Con-elusion 1,)5. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs referred to the reply which had been sent to signor Mussolini1s question whether the Anglo-Italian Agrement possessed any further value(Telegram No. 434 to Rome),The Foreign Secretary said that on theprevious day he had had a talk with Count Grandi,whom he had informed of Signor Mussolini&apos;question and the answer to it which had been sent,Signor Grandi being until then unaware of what had passed in this connection.The Foreign Secretary said that he had also made some reference to Count Grandi1s recentspeech at the Italian Embassy, and had gained theimpression that Count Grandi had received definite instructions to make a speech on these lines.In the circumstances he (the Foreign Secretary)had said that he did not intend to utterunnecessary reproaches on this matter,     A reportof the interview would be circulated in due course.The Cabinet took note of this statement.
HE INTERNATTONAL 6. THE PRIME MINISTER said that, he had. recentlyITU AT TON (Oont*d)  received a letter from a person in contact withelations betweenranee and. Spain,    influential circles in Paris, painting a veryfr.(jrq^b.      gloomy picture of the relations between France and spain.   Under the Eerard-Jordana Agreement the&apos;French Government had undertaken to return to Spainvarious stocks of gold, munitions, warships, etc.,which had been removed to France by the RepublicanGovernment.    According to his informant, they were now refusing to return some       the warships, on theground that, if returned, they might be used bythe Spanish Government to fight against France.They were also refusing to return the gold, as a bargaining, counter in connection with the return of refugees from France to Spain.   All this was having, the worst possible effect on Spanish opinior.,and his informant said that unless the French took ear3yaction to modify their attitude it was likely thatthe Spa.nia.rds would withdraw their Ambassador fromPs.ris and would, join the Berlin-Rome Axis .    TheBritish Government had a. strong interest in seeing that relations between France an^ Spain did notdeteriorate.    It seemer* that  certain influences inthe Quai d&apos;Orsay were blocking every effort toimprove relations between the two countries,   Hewas glad that Sir Erie Phipps was shortly coming tothis country, as he thought that  the matter shouldbe discussed with him very frankly, and pressurebrought to bear on the French Government. jTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that, according to the French account, acertain number of warships had. been restored, andthe Spanish gold was the subject of a case in theCourts,
THE PRIME MINISTER also referred to a speechby General Franco, reported, in that morning&apos;snewspapers, in which he had denounced the attitudeof this country as well as that of France.   ThePrime Minister had no idea what case General Francomight have against this  country in regard to thereturn of property to Spain, but he asked theChancellor of the Exchequer to examine the matter.TH1? CHANCELLOR OF ^HE EXCHEQUER undertook todo this. -^he Cabinet took note of the above.
JTHE INTER- 7. THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRSNATIONAL1 siTUATIONOcaifd.)    referred to Despatches Nos. 323 and 335 from Rome(of the 1st and 4th April, 1939), relating to theWithdrawal of italian War withdrawal of Italian war material from Spain.Material from spain. From these Despatches it appeared that the ItalianGovernment had ma.de reserves in regard to warmaterial ultimately sold or given to General Franco.This matter had been referred to in a Parlia-mentary Question on the 24th May, when the PrimeMinister had stated that he wa.s satisfied that italian armaments would now be withdrawn from Spain.A number of statements had. now appeared in the press to the effect that a. quantity of Italian arms wereto he le^t behind in Spain, and the matter was onewhich was likely to give rise to difficulties inthe House of Commons.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the question was one which might, no doubt, give rise to some difficulties, but that the issue which the opposition were likely to raise wa.s wholly unreal.    There was nothing to prevent Italy withdrawing her war material from Spain and subsequently selling it or giving itto the Spanish Government.   Further, he thoughtthat it was better, fT,om our point of view, thatthis war material should remain in Spain rather thanbe returned to Italy.The Cabinet took note of the above.
THE JHTBRNAT-TONALSITUATION.(previous reference:Cabinet 30(39) Con-elusion 3 0)8. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR enquire whether the Foreign Secretary had any recent newsIn regard to Danzig.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs referred to ^telegram No. 50 from Danzig, in which mr. Shepherd had reported that Dr. Burckhardt*the League of Nations Commissioner, had had an hour&apos;sconversation with Herr von Ribbentrop, and that thelatter had said that, provided there were no furtherincidents and that the Polish Press exercised&quot;restraint, the German Government, for their part,would take steps to reduce the tension.The Foreign Secretary saitf that this telegramcorresponded, with his own appreciation of theposition.The Cabinet took note of the above.
THE INTERNATIONAL 9* THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSSITUATION.    (CONTD.)  referred to the telegrams in regard to theRelations with japan.Position at tientsin.,FTfc. 32,.(3q)2..position at Tientsin where the Japanese Authoritiesthatwere asking/certain Chinese now in the British Concessionat Tientsin, whom- they accused of political of fences,should he handed over to them,  Basing himself on &quot;the reports from our Consul-General at Tientsin, he, the foreign secretary at first favoured the handing over of six of these men to the Japanese Authorities^,On the other hand the view of the Foreign office was that there was no evidence against four of themen concerned, and that there was no justification for handing them over to what would be certaindeath at the hands of the Japanese *     It appearedas though the Japanese were getting into seriousdiffieulties in China and that they were thereforetrying to stir up as much trouble for us aspossible.     There was also some evidence that aroundabout attempt was being : ade by the JapaneseAuthorities to persuade the United StatesGovernment to embark on some form of mediation butit was too early to say how this would develop.His own view was that it was unlikely that there could be any serious development of the situation.In reply to questions by the Lord Chancellor,the Foreign Secretary explained that some time agowe had asked the Japanese Authorities for evidenceagainst four of the men concerned and &quot;chat theyhad not responded.     It was proposed that two
men against whom, there was evidence of complicityin terrorist acts should he handed over.     proposals were also to he made for dealing with the positionin future.     He thought that there was areasonable chance that the matter could be satisfactorily settled on these lines,.     Atthe same time he would not conceal from hiscolleagues that the position at Tientsin was an uncomfortable one, and that there v/as apossibility that force would be used either by the Japanese Army to arrest the four doubtfulcases   or by the mob in order to rescue them.In the latter event orders would be given to fire on the mob.The Cabinet took note of this statement.
10o      THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY gave an account of the salvage operations in connection with .M.S. ThetiSo     2% was hoped that with favourablecondrV&apos; ions the preliminary lifting of the submarinemight be effected within the next 2k-36 hours.The vessel would then be towed into shallow water.It was not proposed to open the vessel until she hadbeen brought into dry dock at Liverpool^The First Lord of the Admiralty explainedhow the disaster had occurred, and referred to thedifficulties   of rescue work owing to the strongtides and to the tilting of the submarine,.     Thesecircumstances had made the work of rescue verydifficultTHE PRIME MINISTER referred to the announce ^ment of a Public Inquiry which had already been made, acourse which he felt sure his colleagues would approve.After consulting with the Lord Chancellor he had asked Sir Alfred Bucknill - Judge of the High Court(Admiralty Division) - who had an unrivalledknowledge of marine matters, to see him that afternoon0He proposed to invite Sir Alfred to act, either alonewith two technical assessors, or as Chairman of a tribunal of three.     A further statement as to thePublic Inquiry would be made as soon as possible.In the course of discussion THE PRESIDENT OFTHE BOARD OF TRADE said that the disaster to the Thetishad been made a subject of the whispering campaign against the Government, and that it was desirable thatthe Public Inquiry should be opened as early aspossible.      It was agreed that this was desirable, andthat the opening of the Public Inquiry should not be delayed until the Naval Inquiry which would deal mainly with technical aspects had been concluded.-14-
MILITARY TRAINING-ACT AND reserve and auxiliary forces ACT.ConsequentialMatters to &quot;bedealt with by-Order in Council.Report of cabinet committee.(previous reference.Cabinet 28(59), Con-clusion 10).11.       The Cabinet had before them the Report ofthe Committee on Consequential Matters to be dealtwith by Order in Council under the MilitaryTraining Act and the Reserve and Auxiliary forces act (CP. 129(39)), in which recommendations weremade regarding the following principal matters:-(i) The civilian liabilities of theman during his period of training(Paragraphs 8 - 16),(ii) Superannuation rights (paragraphs 17 -IS).(iii) The enactments that will require modification by reason of thepassing of the Military TrainingAct (Paragraph 19)..(iv) A number of miscellaneous matters for which provision may have tobe made by Order in Council(Paragraphs 20 - 25).Right todetermineTenancies..(Paras. and 9.)THE MINISTER OF LABOUR said that of the227,000 militia men enrolled on the previousSaturday (5th June), 5,875 were married.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTERexplained the main points in the Committee^ Report.The following are the main points raised in thecourse of discussion.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE raised the point that any provision enabling a Militiamanto give notice to his landlord to determine histenancy should not be made use of by other persons to get rid of onerous tenancies.It was agreed that the possibility of thisshould be borne in mind and guarded against.
Considerable discussion ensured on the questionwhether it was necessary that the provision enablinga Militiaman called up for training to determinehis tenancy on not less than 14 days1 notice, shouldnot be limited to tenancies entered into before a fixed date,THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER thought thatit was undesirable to make an exceptional provision on these lines except to the extent that it mightbe necessary to safeguard the position of personswho were unable to make their arrangements in advance,because they did not know beforehand the positionthey would be in when they were called up for militarytraining.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he felt a gooddeal of difficulty in regard to the proposal giving powerto determine tenancies by short notice.     It was clear that the introduction of compulsory militarytraining would cause a good deal of inconvenience and dislocation:   but he doubted whether it was right that the land-lord should be called upon to bear the loss involved.     He thought the more logicalcourse would be to say that, as a temporary measure,help would be provided, where necessary, to tenantswho were taken by surprise by the imposition of theobligation of compulsory military training.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he felt difficultiesin regard to this provision from another point ofview, namely, that he thought that, in law, an &quot;infant&quot;,could not enter upon a binding lease or tenancyagreement, although he could lawfully contract fornecessaries.     He doubted whether this point had been adequately taken into account in framing these proposals,
It was explained that the Committee of &quot;Ministers had. heen informed that in point of factleases and tenancy agreements were frequently enteredinto by infants,     Further, the Committee had in mindcases where, for example, the tenant died and left a Widow with a son under 21, and a fresh lease was granted to the mother and to the son jointly.After further discussion it was generally agreed that the right to determine a lease or tenancyshould be limited to leases or tenancies enteredinto before a given date.Other provisions THE  CHANCELLOR OP THE DUCHY OP LANCASTER then in regard toRents, explained the remaining provisions in regard to(paragraphs and 9), rents.     Particular importance had been attached bythe Committee to securing that a Militiaman wouldhave the right to resume his tenancy on the terminationof his period of military training.It was pointed out in discussion that an obligation had been placed upon a man&apos;s employer totake him back into his employment at the end of hisperiod of training, but that this might often benullified in practice if the Militiaman was then unableto resume Ms tenancy at the end of his period ofservice.     It was for this reason that it was proposedthat the arrangements set out in the latter half ofparagraph 8 should apply not to tenancies entered intobefore a fixed date but for a period of one or twoyears.In the course of discussion THE CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said that the normal case would be that^ of an unmarried Militiaman, occupying a room at aweek&apos;s notice.     He thought that it was clearly
undesirable to attempt to make a provision which would preserve the Militiaman&apos;s tenancy throughout theperiod of six months&apos; training.      If the room was tobe kept empty, this would mean that the Governmentwould have to pay the rent for a period of six months.It was also pointed out that difficulties wouldairse in regard to landlords or landladies whoderived most of their profits, not from the lettingof rooms, but from the sale of meals to their&apos;lodgers.THE PRIME MINISTER said that looking at thematter on.practical lines, the solution in.such cases should be that the landlord should, have the right to let the room in the Militiaman&apos;s absence, but shouldbe under an obligation to let the Militiaman have it back on the termination of his training.It was pointed out that if the room was on a weekly tenancy there was nothing to prevent the landlord giving notice a week after the Militiamanreturned from his training, or giving him notice aweek or fortnight before he started on his training.But it was felt that an arrangement on the lines suggested by the Prime Minister was the best which couldbe devised to meet a somewhat difficult problem.It was also pointed out that in the case of aMilitiaman with dependants, it would be necessary for the tenancy to be kept alive throughout the Militiaman&apos;speriod of training.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE DUCHY OP LANCASTER saidthat the Committee would see whether arrangements couldbe made on the linos proposed by the Prime Minister.In most cases he felt sure that the matter would workout fairly easily, but there would, no doubt, beexceptional cases.
Mortgage Interestand Loan on House&quot;Property.  (Para. 12).Hitfe FurchaseAgreements (Para. 14),InsurancePremiums (Para. 15).The question in regard to the legal position of minors was again referred to andit was agreed that this point and the positionof contracts entered into jointly by a minor and some other person should he examined.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF trade said that this matter had now been discussed with representatives of the Hire Purchaseinterests.    The latter were strongly opposedto the arrangement tentatively suggested inthis paragraph, and it was now proposed thatthe   question of hire purchase arrangementsentered into before a given date, say 1st July,should be assimilated to that proposed inparagraph 13 for other civil liabilities,namely, that obligations under these agree-ments should be saved from execution, withoutleave of the Court, during the period of training and for six months thereafter.   In fact, theresult would be that it would not be worth thewhile of any of the hire purchase firms to incur expenditure on County Court proceedings,save in very exceptioiial cases.   The main reason why the representatives of the hire purchase business pressed for this arrangement was that they felt that it was wholly unjust to postpone payments under hire purchase agree-ments in respect of articles which would often be used, and would suffer depreciation, duringthe period of military training.The President of the Board of Trade saidthat there had been discussions with therepresentatives of the Insurance Companies.
They took the view that any concession made should he limited to premiums not exceeding 25 a year.    Further, they thought thatarrangements should he made for the policyholder to make up the amount of premiums inrespect of the period of military training overa period of yearsoTHE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER pointed,out that the proposal to deduct unpaidpremiums without interest from the amountsecured by the policy was not actuariallysound.It was agreed that this matter should befurther examined.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR questionedthe proposal that any loss resulting from non-payment of contributions in respect of theperiod of military training should fall onthe scheme rather than on the State.    this meant that the loss would fall on the othercontributors to the scheme.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR said that itwould not be right to assume that any part ofthe lor;.-, to which the Secretary of State forAir had referred should necessarily fall onthe State:    under the arrangements proposed,some loss would fall to be borne by other classes of the community e.g. landlords and employers.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTERexplained that the amount involved would inany case be very small and would be much less important from the point of view of superannuation schemes than considerations such- 20 -
as variations in interest rates, etc.THE MINISTER OP HEALTH said that thepoint was of some importance from the pointof view of local authorities.    The arrangementproposed in regard to local authority serviceswas that the period of training should countas continuing service, but that there shouldbe no obligation on the employers or workers to pay contributions in respect of theperiod of training.    If contributions were paidin full, the period would count in full for pension,    If contributions were not paid theperiod would reckon, as to one-half, for pension.    The Ministry of Health would feelconsiderable difficulty in agreeing to anOrder-in-Council which imposed a definiteobligation on Local Authorities to pay contributions;.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR SCOTLANDsaid that the imposition of an obligation tomake contributions would result in a demand forState assistance,THE MINISTER OF HEALTH agreed, but thought that such a demand should be resisted.the PRIME MINISTER said that he thoughtparagraph 18 was on the right lines.It was agreed that this matter mightbe further examined.
Agricultural &quot;Tith reference to the last sentencecottages(Para. 21),.      of this paragraph, the SECRETARY OP STATE FORSCOTLAND explained that the rate fixed by theAgricultural Wages Committees in these cases would be the normal assessment made bjr these committees.THE MINISTER OP AGRT.CULTURE AND.FISHERIES thought that there were cases inEngland in which no rent was paid.It was agreed that this point shouldbe further considered.Teachers and THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOxI.AwDStudents(Para.32) suggested that some care would be required in framing an order which made it obligatory on education Authorities or olfeer bodies to extend the period of bursaries or scholarships.      Theperiod, would not always loe exactly six months,and the circumstances of pa-particular studentsmight change 0Local THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  TARGovernmentEmployees suggested that it would be desirable to make(Para. 23)it obligatory on Local Authorities to pay to their employees called up as Reservists the differencebetween civil and military pay.       He thoughtthat in the absence of compulsion some few LocalAuthorities   would refuse to do so.After discussion, it was agreed thatthe best plan was to leave this matter for thepresent on the basis proposed in the Committee&apos;sReport, namely that Local Authorities should beempowered to make payments on. the basis proposed.If this procedure proved   unsatisfactory, thematter could be further considered..
C ornpensat i on for death orinjury (Para.24).Applicationof theseprovisionsto men called up for service under theReserve and auxiliary forces act (Para.26).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME affairs said that he felt some difficulty about thesuggestion in this paragraph, which  lookedlike taking away from, for example, policemena right which they already possessed to compensation on a given scale in the event of death or injury. -&quot;;THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY of lancaster said that certain  classes   of public servants were entitled to specially favourablerates of compensation in view of the specialrisks to which they were exposed by the nature oftheir services      The view of the Committee,was however that all persons, while undergoingmilitary training, should be entitled to receivethe same scale of compensation in respect ofinjuries incurred while undergoing militarytraining.THE PRIME MINISTER said  he thoughtthat this view was one which the Cabinet must accept.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER   saidthat this matter had been discussed departmentally.He was prepared to agree to the extension of thearrangements proposed in the case of men calledunder the Military Training Act, to men called up under the Reserve and Auxiliary Forces Actfor two months, but not to those called up for a shorter period.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said he did not regard this question as one whichdepended on the period of time for which theman was called up.    He saw the issue as one ofprinciple.The Government had taken powers- 23 -
under the Acts in question, tc interfere withthe private arrangements of Reservists and Territorialsand of men called up for military training.     TheGovernment had imposed an obligation on employers to keep these men&apos;s jobs open for them, and it wasonly fit and proper that their other rights should be preserved.     Further, Territorials and Reservistswere older men and would have greater responsibilities.In the course of further discussion theCHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that if itwas a question of giving Territorials andReservists called up for service access to the hardship tribunals, he would not raise objection,but he did not see why men called up for amonth should have conferred upon them thevarious rights which were dealt with in theC ommi 11 e e1s Memorandum.It was agreed that this matter shouldbe further considered by the ministerial committee.Procedure. THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was atpresent contemplated that the Orders in council should he released on the evening of Monday, 12th June.If this was done, it appeared that the first availabledate for discussion would be Friday, 16th June.     TheChief Whip thought it would be necessary that theOrders in Council should be accompanied by the presentation of a White Paper.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTERundertook to let the Prime Minister know in the courseof the day whether it would be possible for this time-table to be adhered to.
The Cabinet agreed -(i) to refer the matters dealt with in cp. 129(39) to the ministerial committee under the chairmanship of the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster for further examination in the light of the points raised at the Cabinet discussion.(2) to authorise the Ministerial Committeeto give the necessary instructions for printing and publication of theOrders in Council without further reference to the Cabinet.(During the discussion of this item thePirst Lord of the Admiralty,  the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence, the Secretaryof State for the Colonies and the Ministerof Labour left the meeting),
MINISTRY OP 12.     The Cabinet had under considerationINFORMATION.a Memorandum by the Home Secretary (CP.187(39)),fT/?. .32.(3^r) ^ -     in ^ich he submitted, with the approval of theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, proposalsfor an immediate announcement of the Government&apos;policy with regard to publicity measures, both inpeace and war.In his Memorandum the Home Secretarystated that, by the desire of the Prime Minister,a Ministerial Committee, consisting of theForeign Secretary, the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence and himself, had for some weeks been considering what steps should be taken duringpeace to counteract anti-British propaganda andto institute a more active policy of Britishpublicity overseas.    With this object in view it was proposed, with the approval of theChancellor of the Exchequer:-(i) to strengthen and expand the NewsDepartment of the Foreign Office bythe addition of staff whose duty itwould be to watch foreign press andbroadcasts, to supply material fortelegrams and articles, and to prepare(or cause to be written by outsideexperts) press articles presenting the antidote to anti-british propaganda: and(ii) to explore and give effect to other means of giving publicity abroad tothe British case and attitude throug hall the channels available.For these purposes it would be necessary to ask parliament in July to vote additional funds inthe form of Supplementary Estimates for theForeign Office and for Diplomatic and consular services.With reference to publicity in time ofwar, plans were being made for the organisation
of a Ministry of Information to &quot;be brought into being in a time of crisis,  if the Government of the day should so decide.    The small body of Civil servants and others engaged on these plans had found themselvesseriously hampered by the obligation of secrecy andthe lack of funds, and the Home Secretary had reachedthe conclusion that if the Ministry was to be madeready to function at an optimum efficiency immediately on the outbreak of war, it was essential that those responsible for its planning should be provided Withthe funds necessary for their task.    He suggestedthat the proper course would be to abandon the present policy of secrecy and to ask Parliament openly to vote the necessary supply by means of a supplementary estimate for the Home Office, as the parentDepartment of the Ministry.    The Earl of Perth hasconsented to become Director-General-Designate of thaMinistry, and to be available for that purpose.untilthe work of planning was complete.    Lord Perth had also agreed to undertake a general supervision Oy^jpthe main lines of policy in regard to the overseaspublicity work in the Foreign Office from 19th June,with a view to ensuring continuity between thepeace-time activities of the Foreign Office in relationto publicity abroad and the work that would fall uponthe Ministry of Information in war.    The HomeSecretary therefore recommended that a statement(of which he attached a draft approved by theForeign Secretary) should be made in Parliament bythe Prime Minister on or about the 12th June.
THE HOME SECRETARY explained that the essence of his proposal was to find means of dealingat one and the same time with (a) the problem of more active publicity overseas in time of peace - a matter which must remain a Foreign Office responsibility, and(to) machinery for enabling a Ministry of Information to toe set up in the event of war.    He was satisfied thatit would toe very difficult to set up in time of peacea Department which would have functions in relationto home propaganda.    Such a course would toe strongly opposed toy the Latoour Party.Continuing, the Home Secretary said that hethought that a transition from peace to war arrangements would toe greatly eased toy the appointment of Lord Pertfein the dual capacity of first, assisting the ForeignOffice in overseas publicity and, secondly, acting as director-General-Designate of the war-time Ministry ofInformation.The Home Secretary said that, while he asked for general approval of an announcement on thelines of the draft appended to his statement, hethought that the draft would require some amendment.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER and THESECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that they would have certain suggestions to make in regard to the termsof the proposed announcement.The Secretary of State for Air also said thathe assumed that the Home Secretary&apos;s proposals would not affect the work at present done toy, for example, theAir Ministry on propaganda overseas in regard to matters affecting that Department.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said that atthe present time the British case was toeing assailedall over the world toy extensive and vigorous propaganda.
He thought that the proposals in the Home Secretary&apos;sMemorandum would he criticised on the ground thatthey did not go far enough.    He also said that thepresent proposals did nothing to improve the positionin the Middle East in regard to propaganda.    He suggestedthat there was need for co-ordination of the activitiesof the Colonial Office, the Foreign Office and the three service Departments in the Middle East.If we were engaged in a shadow war, we must useevery weapon available to us as freely as possible.    Thepresent proposals were, broadly speaking, confined tothe dissemination of news.    If they were adopted, weshould lay ourselves open to accusations that we werefollowing the example of the Totalitarian States insetting up a propaganda organisation, but were not doing the job thoroughly.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE also thought that these proposals did not go far enough,that persons with special experience might be requiredfor these duties, and that the Home Secretary&apos;sproposals would be severely criticised.After some further discussion, it was agreed-That further discussion of these proposals should be adjourned until the next weekly meeting of the Cabinet.
corporal punishment.(previous reference .Cabinet 26 (39)Cooaclu&amp;ion 9)13.     THE HOME SECRETARY said that he had discussed this matter with the Chief Whip andhe had also had an opportunity of mentioningto the Prime Minister.     He thought that the right course was that this proposal should be left to thefree vote of the House.     He proposed to see thechief protagonists in the near future, and toindicate to them that, if they would drop certain other proposals, the Government would be preparedto leave the matter of corporal punishment to a free vote of the House.This course was approved.Some discussion ensued as to the actionwhich Ministers should take on this occasion.     Hodecision was reached, but the view generallyexpressed was that, while Ministers might abstain,it would be undesirable that they should vote against the proposals for the abolition of corporal punishment included in the Billy,  h uXz&quot; jL&amp;^f-
14.       The Cabinet had before them a joint memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland(CP. 128 (39)) on the subject of Milk Legislation.The Ministers recalled that the Milk Industry Bill,which had contained the GovernmentJs long-term proposals for the industry, had been withdrawn on 2nd February, 1939, as a result of the unfavourablereception accorded to a number of its more importantprovisions.     The whole position had since been reviewed, and, while they were not yet in a positionto introduce any revised long-term proposals, theMinisters put forward certain interim proposalswhich they summed up at the end of their memorandum as follows:&apos;-&quot;(1)   We seek our colleagues&apos; authority(a) to prepare interim milk legislation for early introdiiction and forpassage into law before the summer recess;    the provisions of this legislation to operate (in the caseof items (i) to (iii) below) forthe two years 1st October, 1938, to30th September, 1940, and to providefor(i) Exchequer contributions towardsquality milk premiums paid bymilk marketing boards on the scales contemplated under the milk Industry Bill;(ii) Exchequer contributions asproposed under the milk industry Bill towards the costof schemes for the supply of milk at reduced prices forconsumption by schoolchildrenand expectant and nursing mothers and young children;(iii) Exchequer assistance to milk marketing boards in respect of milk used, within the limits of the standard quantitiesspecified in the Milk industry bill, for the manufacture of butter or cheese in the eventof overage prices of imported
butter or cheese falling over six-monthly winter and summer periodsbelow certain standard levels;. &apos; these standard price levels to bethe same as those proposed underthe Milk Industry Bill in the caseof cheese, i0e, 67,;;,6d. per cwt.in winter and 62s*6d* per cwt, in summer, but to be 125s. per cwt.in winter and 11.5s. per cwt. in summer in the case of butter;!(iv)    certain minor matters of which themost important would be the provisionincluded in the Milk Industry Billrequiring a milk marketing board to consult the appropriate consumers1committee before prescribing prices;(b)    ,ito announce, on the introduction of theproposed interim milk legislation, thatrfhe attitude of the Government to further legislation next year will be as set outin paragraph 9 of CoPo 128 (39). and thatIn the meantime the Government propose toset up a committee to inquire into the costs of milk distribution and to ask parliament, in the autumn, to confer ontHat committee, by resolution, the powersavailable under the Tribunals of Inquiry(Evidence) Act, 1921;    and(2)   While recognising that pasteurisation proposals put forward by local authorities by means ofpriva.te: bills cannot now be opposed in principle^we repoWend that final acceptance of any such proposals should be made conditional on theinclusion of safeguards at least as effective asthose contained in Part VII of the Milk IndustryBille&quot;Discussion centred on the proposals in theMinisters&apos; paper dealing with costs of distribution.THE MINISTER OP, AGRICULTURE AND - FISHERS In -hisopening statement, explained that, while his specificproposal for legislation formed a short-term proposal,it would be necessary that he should give some indications in regard&apos;to the Governments attitude to long-term proposals, and that this involved the questionof costs of distribution.      He thought that there was acase for an enquiry and that there was a case for come degree of rationalisation, which would effect somesavings in costs*     The matter was one to which the
Treasury attached importance.     At the same time, thequestion was one which was hound to give rise to political difficulties and on which he was anxious for the guidanceof his colleagues.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that he was prepared-to support the Minister&apos;s proposals on the under-standing that the   three parts of the programme stoodtogether, and-that there would he an enquiry into the costs of milk distribution.     Unless this subject was tackled,we should he drifting into a position of permanentsubsidisation of the milk industry.In the course of discussion the view was expressed that the present time was not a suitable one in which toraise the question of costs of milk distribution-     In theWhite Paper of July, 1937* in which the policy enshrinedin the 1938 Milk Bill had been outlined, reference had beenmade to the need for improved organisation of the distributive services, and it had therefore been necessaryto include in that Bill provision to deal with this subject.The inclusion of these proposals had been partly responsible for the unpopularity of that Bill,It was agreed that further discussion of thismatter should be deferred till the next weekly meeting atthe Cabinet.THE MINISTER OP HEALTH also reserved his positionin regard to pasteurisation.
