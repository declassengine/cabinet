jhe inter-Jjationalsituation.lEussia.[(previous reference:Cabinet 31(39) , Con-clusion 2.)1. THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs reminded his colleagues that, at the last Meetingof the Cabinet, he had. informed them that sir William Seeds had been asked to return toLondon to receive further instructions.      Immedi-ately afterwards news had been received that sir William Seeds was suffering from influenza,and it had been decided instead that Mr. Strang,the Head of the Central Department of the ForeignOffice, should go to Moscow, where he was due toarrive that morningc     Before leaving for MoscowMr. Strang had attended a Meeting of the ForeignPolicy Committee held on Friday, 9th June.     Atthat Meeting a discussion had taken place as tothe general lines of our policy, and as to theprocedure to be followed.      It was not proposedthat the negotiations should, be resumed by the handing in of a revised draft agreement by our representatives.     The latter had been authorisedto submit various suggestions to meet the situationswhich might arise in their discussions with theSoviet representatives, and it was hoped that sir William Seeds would.be able, by means of these discussions, to build up an Agreement article by article.     Our Ambassador had been furnished witha very comprehensive memorandum setting out thepoints on which we were in agreement and thepoints of difficulty which still remained,and giving general instructions as to the lines on which the situation should be handled.
The Foreign secretary then read to hiscolleagues the following extract from theinstructions given to Sir William Seeds:-/   &quot;The draft treaty should he as short and simple in its terms as possible.It is better that agreement shouldbe quickly reached than that time should be spent in toying to coverevery contingency.     It is realised that this may leave loopholes in the text and possibly lead to differences of opinion as to the interpretation of the treaty at a later date;   but those disadvantages are preferable to a long&apos; delay in the conclusionof the treaty, and less serious thanthe elaboration of detailed provisions,which, if the treaty ever came to be executed, might be found, in practice,to bind His Majesty&apos;s Governmentmore effectively than the SovietGovernment.&quot;The Foreign Secretary added that he had seenM. Maisky, who had expressed a considerable degreeof confidence as to a successful outcome of theFrench, who were hopeful of the outcome of thenegotiations.negotiations.He had also been in touch with theThe Cabinet took note of theabove statement by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs.
THE INTER-national situation (Contd.)The position at Tientsin.(previous Reference:Cabinet 31 (39) ,Conclusion 9.)2. THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs said that two days ago the Japanese Vice-Ministerfor Foreign Affairs had suggested that theUnited States Government might be asked to lendtheir good offices towards a settlement of this dispute.     We had agreed to this course.About the same date, Sir A Clark Kerr, our ambassador in China, had suggested that anindependent Committee of Inquiry might b*e setup, consisting of a British and a Japanes^member, and a third member from some other\country.      It had been proposed that the thirdmember should be appointed by the United StatesGovernment, and the latter had agreed to thiscourse.      In the meantime, the Japanese authorities at Tientsin had rejected Sir A. Clark Kerr&apos;proposal;    but they had taken this action before they had been made aware of the fact that theUnited States Government were willing to nominate a member.     It was also possible that theJapanese authorities at Tokyo might take a somewhat different view on the matter from theJapanese authorities at Tientsin.The latest news on the situation was contained in a telegram from the War Office, which included a formal statement by the JapaneseMilitary Spokesman as to the action which theJapanese authorities intended to take that dayeThis action was as follows:-&quot;1.      Traffic in and out of British andFrench concessions will be permitted between0500 and 2100 concession time except onlyin case of international bridge which willnot be closed until 2300 hrs.2.     Luring these hours all persons exceptsoldiers in uniform and those in possessionof special Japanese permits will be subjectto searchc    All foreigners not in militaryuniform passing barriers must be in
possession of identity certificatesstamped by their consulate (specialstamp for purpose was sent to Britishconsulate 12th June).3.     All ships arriving at Tientsin willbe stopped and inspected.     Detains given above subject to confirmation later.&quot;The Foreign Secretary said that, in hisadvisers1 view, on the face of it these proposalsrepresented a &quot;damp squib&quot;.     With the exception of thethird measure, namely, the control of shipping, the steps threatened amounted to no more than the actionwhich had been tali en in the Spring.     The view ofhis Foreign Office advisers (including Mr. Howe, whohad recently served in China) was that theJapanese would soon find that the arrangements whichthey proposed to carry out would give them considerabletrouble, more particularly as there were several hundred United States citizens in the Concession... .It was felt that the Japanese action in this matter was in conformity with the methods which they were likely to adopt of making some attempt to &quot;save face&quot;.Generally, his advisers thought that after a time away but of the difficulty might be found.If this view proved to be mistaken, then theForeign Secretary thought we should consider thepossibility of talcing such retaliatory steps in theeconomic field as could easily be enforced andcancelled.     He asked whether the President of theBoard of Trade would be willing that examination shouldbe made into the possibilities of such action.     his department were disposed to take the view that certainaction could be taken which would cause considerableinconvenience to the Japanese, but which would have verylittle harmful effect on our own interests.    Generally,however, his impression was that it was unlikely thatthere would be any catastrophic events in Tientsin.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OF TRADE said thathe would be glad to carry out such an investigation,-4- &quot;       . I
but he thought it would be an advantage if an expert in international law were to be associated with the inquiry, since it was necessary to make certain what action we were in a position to take, in view of thefact that the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty was still in force.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that the only informa-tion he had received on the legal aspect of the case was contained in the telegrams from our Consul-general at Tientsin.    Mr. Jamieson had said that the localDistrict Court had issued a Warrant in regard to thefour men in question.    Mr. Jamieson contended that,according to the Foreign Concession documents, the concession authorities were hound to comply with thedemands of the District Court.    It was, of course,possible that the law had been carried out in adisgraceful manner by the District Court, but theLord Chancellor said that he felt apprehensive as tothe legal position.    He asked whether the foreign secretary would supply him with a statement as to thelegal aspect of the case.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said he would gladly do so.As regards the type of retaliatory actionwhich might be taken, he had in mind such steps as requiring Consular Certificates in regard to exports from North China.    He understood that this course wasfavoured in commercial circles, and had recently been  &apos;supported by Lord Blibank in the House of Lords.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he felt a consider-able measure of apprehension in regard to the position.We had acted in this matter in flat contradiction tothe advice given by our Consul-General at Tientsin.The Prime Minister quoted from Telegram No. 193 fromTienstin, in which Mr. Jamieson had reported that
in the case of the four men wq were definitely onunsound ground; not only were the men members of - 9,terrorist gang, but they had coinFessed to complicityin murder, and we were not in a position to prove that these confessions had been obtained &quot;by torture.The Prime Minister also referred to a telegramfrom Sir Eric Phipps, according to which a similar casein the French Concession had been settled by handing over a man to the District Court.    There was thefurther consideration that the situation in Europe wasnot such that it would be easy for us to send a fleet to the Far East.    Generally, Mr. Jamieson&apos;s advice wasthat if we were to find ourselves engaged in a dispute with Japan,  it would be advisable that we should do soon a matter on which we were on sure ground, which wasnot the case in the present instance.The Prime Minister noted that it was nowproposed to consider economic sanctions.    This weaponhad not been very successful in the past, and theReport (C.I.D. Paper No, 3365-b) of a Committee under theChairmanship of the Minister of Health as to theimposition of sanctions in the Far East was by no jneansencouraging.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he shared the Prime Minister&apos;s apprehensions.At the same time it must be remembered that if we wereto yield completely to the Japanese demand - a course1which he thought no-one would support - the result would be that we should be subjected to increasing pressure throughout the Far East.    It was difficultto hold the balance between action which might involve us in serious difficulties and action which wouldresult in our being subjected to further pressure fromthe Japanese.
Reference was made to Sir A.  Clark Kerr&apos;suggestion of a Tribunal.    It was felt that thissuggestion was a helpful onef but that it would havebeen more helpful if it had been made at a somewhatearlier date.The Cabinet -(l) Took note of the above statements;(2) Invited the President of the Boardof Trade to consider possibleretaliatory measures against japan in the economic field;(3) Invited the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to submit to theLord Chancellor a statement on thelegal aspect of the case.
m THE INTER-I MTIONALI SITHATIOU.I (Confd)Danzig,(previous reference:. cabinet 31 (39)1 conclusion 8.)31      THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that, on the previous evening, he had seen mr. Makins who had passed on to him Dr. Burckhardfsreport of the situation.     Dr. Burckhardt had statedthat all the parties in Danzig had welcomed his return and it seemed that both the Poles and germans in Danzig were anxious that he should return to Uanzigfor the time being at any rate.     The consent of theother two Governments on the Committee of three to Dr. Burckhardt&apos; s return had been Invited.     france had agreed and, provided Sweden would agree also,Dr. Burckhardt would return.Dr. Burckhardfs general impression of histalks in Berlin was that Germany did not intend totake any desperate action in regard to Danzig for thetime being.     Germany&apos;s policy seemed to rely onsqueezing Poland partly perhaps through financial difficulties,which it was thought would ensue from poland maintaining so large a proportion of her forcesih a state of mobilisation  There was also evidence of a desire on both sides to discuss matters, but so far this evidence had not taken any very definite shape.It was possible that Dr. Burckhardt, after his returnto Danzig, might be of assistance in getting theparties together.      Dr. Burckhardt thought that theconclusion of an agreement between thiscountry and Russia would have a steadying effect on german opinion.Dr. BurckhardtTs views as to the ultimate solution included a neutralisation of Danzig, by whichhe apparently meant demilitarisation.    He also thoughtthat the customs arrangements should he revised ab as iogive Poland a security for her position but to relieve
the Germans in Dan/.ig or arrangements which involvedPolish control of a German, city0      He agreed, however,that these suggestions were somewhat vague and were unlikely to result in a settlement unless the two sides were prepared to discuss matters amicably..Dr. Burckhardt intended to direct his energies to thisend.In reply to the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the Foreign Secretary said that he assumed that byneutralisation Dr. Burckhardt meant demilitarisationunder a German-Polish guarantee and that he had it inmind that, if Germany failed to honour the guarantee, ourguarantee with Poland would come into play.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought thatneutralisation was hardly compatible with incorporation of danzig in the Reich, and ho doubted whether Germany wouldbe prepared to conclude an agreement which did not providefC2* the incorporation of Danzig in the Reich,The Cabinet took note of this statement.
k.      THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that there seemed to he some support for the viewthat Germany intended to incorporate Slovakia in the reich on the 15th June.        He was, however, unableto say whether the rumours to this effect were well founded,       If Germany took this action, it would ofcourse be lamentable,   but he doubted whether there was any action in the matter which we could properly take*There were some indications to the effect that possible german action in Slovakia was less likely to be carriedout with the connivance of Hungary.   The PolishAmbassador had said to the Foreign Secretary that,owing to the geographical confjgmstion of the land, the incorporation of Slovakia in the Reich would not have much effect on Poland.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said thathe had recently had some conversation with a manufacturerin the iron industry in Slovakia who was himself aSlovak.     His informant had said that he hoped thatthis country would not take any action if Germanyincorporated Slovakia in the  Reichr and he added thatif this happened the Slovaks would give the Germans agreat deal of trouble.THE PRIME MINISTER said that we had given noundertaking that, in certain contingencies, we shouldafford help to Slovakiae-     Further, it seemed to him -that the formal incorporation of Slovakia in the Reichwould not make matters very different from what theywere at the present time.      In any case, he agreed withthe Foreign Secretary in thinking that there was no action which we could take about the matter.The Cabinet took note of this statement.
THE INTERNATIONAL-SITUATION ( Confa)Anglo-German( Naval Agreement.(previous reference:Cabinet 26 (39)Conclusion 2.)5.      THE SECRETARY OP STaTE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS informed the Cabinet that a araft notedealing with this matter had been submitted tothe Foreign Policy Committee,     He proposed that this note,as    redrafted in the light of the suggestions made at the Foreign Policy Committee, should besubmitted to the next weekly meeting of theCabinet.This course was agreed toc
THE INTER-national situation(CONT&apos;D.)Relationswith Spain.(previous reference:Cabinet 31(39), Con-clusion 6. )6c   . THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER reminded his colleagues that at the previous meeting of theCabinet the Prime Minister had referred to a speech by G-eneral Franco reported in that morning&apos;snewspapers - in which he had denounced the attitudeof this country as well as that of France in regardto the return of property.to Spain.    The Chancellorof the Exchequer said that he had enquired intothe matter, and it appeared that a considerable quantity of assets had been brought from Spain and handed over to a Swiss subject who had proceeded toset up a Trust whereby these assets   would be devotedto the relief of Spanish Refugees.    G-eneral Franco&apos;sGovernment were now trying to secure the return ofthese assets which had been lodged in a safe deposit,and the matter was now the subject of an action inthe Courts.    It was perfectly right that &quot;this matter shouldbe made the subject of an action by the SpanishGovernment, and he had no doubt that a decisions would be reached promptly.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had spoken about this matter to the Spanish Ambassador,who had said that he had no complaint against theBritish Government,   but had expressed the view  .that the Trust was a fraud.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he had made enquiries into the matter and was in generalagreement with the views expressed by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.    He thought there might, however,be some difficulty in securing that the case wasfinished before the long vacation, but he wouldmake some investigations into this point.
THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was perhapssomewhat ominous that General Franco should refer to the matter, since it looked as though he was seeking justification for making complaint against this country.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO mentioned that his firm were acting in this case, although he, of course, had no personal knowledge of thematter.The Cabinet took note of this statement.
THE INTER- 7.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND askedRATIONALSITUATION (O0NTD)the Foreign Secretary whether he had any news as to howRelationswith Italy.(previous reference cabinet 31(39), Con-clusion 5. )Signor Mussolini   had received our reply to his question whether the Anglo-Italian Agreementpossessed any further value.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he had not yet had an opportunity of seeingSir Percy Loraine, who had just arrived in thiscountry for a short period of leave, and he had nofurther news to report.- Ik -
POLISHFINANCIALMISSION.8.    THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that the Polish Financial Mission were arriving in this country that day.    It seemed only toolikely that we should have to disappoint the expectations of the Polish Government as to theextent of the assistance which we could give them.He hoped, therefore, that the discussions on financial matters could he started quickly and could he carried out in as helpful a spirit aspossible in order to minimise the Mission&apos;sdisappointment.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said thatthe Treasury would, of course, do whatever theycould to ease the negotiations, hut it was clear-that it was impossible to afford financial assistanceto Poland on anything like the scale proposed bythe Polish Government. .The Cabinet took note of this statement.
HmiSTRY OFINFORMATION.(previous previous reference:Cabinet 31(39), Con-clusion 12),9.    The Cabinet again had under consideration theproposals regarding publicity measures both in peace-time and in the event of war, contained in theMemorandum by the Home Secretary (CP. 127(39)), v/hichhad been before the   Cabinet at the previous Meeting,together with a revised draft Parliamentary question and Answer on this subject.THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR HOME AFFAIRS saidthat he was satisfied that it was necessary to movestep by step in this matter, and that the measures proposed represented the best means of making a start..If a full Ministry of Information were now to be setup* this would give rise to considerable criticism,.Further, it would mean taking away from the foreign secretary an important part of his responsibilities,and would make matters difficult for the foreign secretary.     He had made some study of the history ofthe Ministry of Information during the war, from whichit appeared that the side of the Ministry for which lord Northcliffe had been responsible had done a gooddeal less than many people imagined,.     A study of thewar history also showed that the Ministry of Information,as it existed in war, could not endure for a. singleday in time of peace.,     It was evident that it wouldbe a great- mistake to attempt to set up a full-blownMinistry of Information at the present time.   Mr. Attleeand Mr. Greenwood, with whom he had discussed thematter, had very strongly opposed the establishment ofa Ministry of Information in time of peace, but theyhad agreed that more comprehensive measures of publicitywere required at the present time under the aegis of theForeign Office.     Much of the criticism of Lord Perth&apos;s
appointment had been beside the mark.     He was not a minister in embryo hut he was being appointed as thePermanent Secretary designate of the war-time Depart-ment.     This, however, did not mean that the organisation should not and would not be strengthened by the additionof personnel with experience in publicity matters.THE PRIME MINISTER explained that Lord Perth wouldhave two functions,,     In addition to work on planning thewar-time Ministry of Information, he would be engaged onpeace-time publicity work under the Foreign Office.    Hewould have a room in the Foreign Office and he would bein charge of the staff engaged on publicity work whichhad already been increased from seven to twenty.     Itwas also proposed that special attention should be paidto publicity matters by the Parliamentary Under-secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Continuing, the Prime Minister said that he was satisfied that the establishment of a Ministry ofInformation in time of peace v/ould give rise to grave difficulties in this country.     Further, the establishmentof a Ministry of Information v/ould mean that the existing...publicity work of Departments would have to be brought within the scope of the Ministry of Information.     Thiswould be a mistake.     For the time being the work was better done in the Departments, subject to the work being co-ordinated from a central office and extended.
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR expressed agreement with this view.     He thought the achieve-men ts of the German Ministry of Propaganda wereexaggerated.     Much of their work was not well done and there was much force in the view that the lesspropaganda was under official control the more effective it was.     He thought it was important thatwe should take immediate steps to extend ourorganisation and he therefore supported the present proposal.      If the scheme now proposed was found by experience to require amendment? this could always be done.     He also attached importance to theDepartments continuing publicity work within theirown spheres.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR WAR said that itwas proposed to make a somewhat lengthy announcement,with the result that public opinion would ask what steps were to be taken in future which were not taken now.      He asked whether the steps proposed would, in fact, enable us to take effective actionto counteract the effective propaganda with whichwe were now facedo     He instanced the german propaganda carried out by German governesses in european countries, and the atrocity propagandacarried out against us in the Middle East.     would the new organisation have enough money to subsidisethe Press in the Middle East?   If our publicityactivities were to be confined to the dissemination of news, then the proposed announcement would giverise to expectations which would not be fulfilled.He would much prefer it if we could take steps toincrease our activities without making any public announcement.
THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that the terras ofthe proposed announcement might perhaps require tohe reviewed.     He emphasised, however, the difficultyof carrying on the arrangements in regard to planning for a war-time Ministry of Information in the presentatmosphere of secrecy which resulted from the arrangement whereby these measures were financed from the secret service vote.The Foreign Secretary referred to the criticismswhich had been made, to the effect that little or nothing was being done in regard to propaganda.     Hehad again, during the previous week, reviewed whatwas being done in such varied fields as the press;the B*B.C; films; tourists&apos; travel; the activitiesof the British Council, and so forth.     Taken together,these activities represented a considerable field of activity.     He gave figures showing the increase inthe grant in aid to the British Council, as follows:-1935 5,0001936 15,0001937 60,0001938 110,0001939 400,000In regard to the Middle East, the question had recently been examined by a Departmental Committee onwhich the War Office had been represented, and an agreedscheme had been put forward, which, in the view of theDepartments concerned, would be extremely valuable.The Foreign Secretary said that he disagreedemphatically with the view that the Press Departmentof the Foreign Office should not be charged withthese duties.     It was the function of the Foreign Officeto know what was going on all over the world, and he
would be greatly embarrassed if publicity functionsabroad were transferred to some department not under his control.     He welcomed the suggestion that the parliamentary under Secretary should be more closely and formallyassociated with publicity work.     While the scheme putforward might require amendment in the future, he was nevertheless strongly in favour of adopting it as animmediate step.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP EDUCATION enquire whether we were prepared to spend enough to make thescheme worth while.     All publicity work involvedexpenditure.     For example he was not satisfied thatwe always spent enough on our hospitality.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was a defectin the present organisation that there was no one personwhose duty it was to supervise publicity as a whole.This defect would be remedied by the measures nowproposed and he thought that results would come of themselves.     He was satisfied that we could usefullyspend more money on propaganda but, at the same time, hewould not be in favour of spending money on the lavishscale of the German Government.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR thought that weshould take a larger view of the expenditure on propaganda,but at the same time we must be careful to avoid recklessexpenditure.Continuing, THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was inevitable that a public statement should be made on thismatter.     A number of Questions had been put down in theHouse of Commons, and there had been discussion of thematter in the press.
THE HOME SECRETARY agreed that a statement was inevitable, both on these grounds, and also in order toput a stop to the rumours which had been started thatwe proposed to set up a press censorship and a propaganda organisation for internal purposes.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that our-    &apos; -methods were, he thought, more subtle and efficient than-Germany*s and that it was desirable that any announcement which we made should, if possible,  avoid creating theimpression that we were intending to substitute a Ministryof Propaganda for our present methods of quiet permeation.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR SCOTLAND agreed,  and thought that the announcement should stress that the stepsproposed were a natural development of the measures already taken rather than the adoption of some entirely new policy,Prom his previous experience he thought that the amountof work that was being done in this sphere was not adequately appreciated.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOAhD OP TRADE said that hewas afraid that the announcement proposed might have abad effect.     He would have preferred it if it had beenpossible not to deal with the matter by a parliamentary question and Answer, or by a Statement after Questionsbut simply by presenting a Supplementary Estimate to-make fuller financial provision.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the cabinet should approve the Home Secretary&apos;s scheme but that thedraft announcement should be reconsidered.     He thoughtthat the draft should be much shorter and that it shouldbe in the direction of indicating the lines on which we
*1   owere developing this work rather than of suggesting thata new propaganda organisation was being established.     he agreed with a suggestion made by the Secretary of statefor War that the statement might, perhaps, start with a negative statement that it was not intended to establish a Ministry of Information in peace-time.Some discussion ensued on the point whether itwas necessary to refer in the proposed announcement tothe war-time organisation,,      It was agreed that thiswas probably necessary.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP EDUCATION suggestedthat it would be desirable that the Cabinet should receive a survey of the work already being done in regard topublicity, and, at a later date, a statement indicatingLord Perth*s plans for the development of these activities.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs agreed to Circulate a survey of the work already carried out,CONCLUSIONS.The Cabinet:-(i)    Approved the proposals set out in theMemorandum by the Home Secretary C.P.12Y(37)including the appointment of Lord Perth.(ii)    Agreed that the draft announcement in.regard to these measures should be modified on the lines indicated by thePrime Minister,(iii)    Invited the Foreign Secretary to circulate to the Cabinet a survey of themeasures now being undertaken in regardto publicity and propaganda generally.qq-    C.C.    -
elusion 14.)margin,THE MINISTER OP AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES saidthat since the last Meeting of the Cabinet he had had some discussion with Mr. Baxter, Chairman of the milk marketing Board,     Mr. Baxter had informed him thatrationalisation of milk distribution was in fact takingplace rapidly.     The number of retailers (excludingproducer retailers), which had been 21,000 in 1933,was only 13,000 in 1939, and of this latter numbersome 357 distributors dealt with half the milk supplyof the country.     He had also discussed the matter withMr. Poster, the General Manager of the Milk MarketingBoard, who had informed him that the milk trade wasnot losing money through overlapping, but throughexcessive zeal in regard to the services given.     Forexample, Mr, Maggs, the Chairman of the United DairiesCompany, had said that if only one delivery a day were tobe made in pint bottles, 2d. a gallon would be saved in distribution costs.     The Milk Marketing Board thought that,if left to themselves, the number of distributors wouldgradually be reduced, and that this process would beimpeded rather than accelerated by any forcible attemptto deal with the matter.The Milk Marketing Board, however, attachedconsiderable importance to some attempt to limit thenumber of deliveries to one per diem.     At the presentXJS LSGIS-       10,      -The Cabinet again had before them a JointTION.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP.-128 (39))previous reference: on the subject of Milk Legislation, further considerationCabinet 31(39), Con-       of which had been deferred at the Meeting noted in the
moment there was only one delivery per day in London on sundays.    Birmingham had only one delivery a day9 withthe result that the cost of retail distribution was 6d. per gallon only as compared with the distributive margin ofabout llfd.  in the big towns.The Minister said that ho had given furtherconsideration to the matter since the last meeting of theCabinet3 and he felt that considerable difficulties were likely to ensue if we went as far as he had proposed inhis Memorandum in regard to establishing a Committee to enquire into the costs of milk distribution.    In view ofthe fact that it would be necessary to deal with our long-term milk policy next year at the latest, he thoughtthat it might be desirable to set up a Cabinet Committeeto deal with this difficult problem.In the course of the discussion which ensued3 theCHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER reminded his colleagues thatthe proposals contained in the Memorandum by the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland had included9 as part of a single scheme,the provision of Exchequer contributions under variousheads (the total of Exchequer assistance to the Industrybeing increased)9 together with an announcement that theGovernment proposed to establish an expert Inquiry intothe costs of milk distribution.    Unless this was done? hethought we were in danger of drifting into a position inwhich the milk industry was permanently subsidised.    TheChancellor referred to paragraphs 9 and 10 of theMinisters&apos; Memorandum (CP.-188 (39) )9 and Conclusion (b)on page 15.    Everything which the Minister had said onlywent to show that an Inquiry into distribution costs was entirely reasonable.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE pointed outthat the main facts in regard to the cost of distribution had been made known by the very careful
Tnquiry undertaken two years ago by the Food. Council,He also thought it was necessary to bear in mind the. political difficulties which had led to the withdrawal of the milk industry Bill last autumn.    He thought that the proposals foran Inquiry on the lines set out in CP,-128 (39.)) were likelyto arouse great opposition.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS was opposedto the proposal to confer on the Committee by Resolution thepowers available under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence)Act, 1921, unless this course was absolutely necessary.THS SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that when the milk Industry Bill had been introduced last autumn,  there hadbeen less opposition in Scotland than in England to the rationalisation proposals.    He had considered whether it wouldbe possible to introduce a separate Bill to rationalise theindustry in Scotland, but when he had enquired into the matterhe had found that there was considerable opposition to ameasure on the lines proposed.In regard to the suggestion to set up a CabinetCommittee, THE MINISTER OF HEALTH suggested that such aCommittee might consider the separation of the public healthaspect of distribution from the economic aspect,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thought thatit would not be impossible to find some means of reconciling the two opposing points of view which had been put before theCabinet,    He suggested that a statement might be made on thelines of paragraph 9 and of the two opening sentences ofparagraph 10. For the rest of   paragraph 10 afterthe socpnd sentence he would substitute a statement in which more general terms, to the effect that a good dealof information was already available as to the cost of
(* 1  0 udistribution, and that if it was found necessary toobtain further information the Government would takethe necessary steps to this eiidiTHE PRESIDENT OF TIIE BOARD OF EDUCATIONthought that some indication might be given that wewere anxious to help the trade to help themselves.He instanced distributors who were forced bycompetitors to give as many as three deliveriesdaily.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND fisheries said that he was anxious to get a cheap milk schemefor mothers and infants started on a national scale.As, however, the Milk Marketing Board had beendosing money on experimental schemes of this kindin the Special Areas- it would be necessary to bemore generous in the application of the formula for exchequer grants,THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE, referring to Conclusion (iv) on page 14 of the Memorandum(CP. 128(59)). said that before provisions couldbe included in the Milk Bill requiring the milk marketing Boards to consult the appropriate Consumers1Committee before prescribing prices, it would benecessary that the Chairmen of the Committees shouldbe consulted so as to make certain that they wereprepared to accept the new arrangements proposed.This was agreed to,THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIESreferred to the question of the future of theattested Herds Scheme which had been mentioned inparagraph 14 of his memorandum.      He-&quot; explained that
cr. .** -Tkthis matter had heen further discussed with theChancellor of the Exchequer and that agreement had now heen reached in regard to it.     He invited the authority of his colleagues to make an announce-ment on the subject o;i the Second Reading of the milk Bill, subject to the precise terms of theannouncement being settled with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer.This course was agreed tooAfter further discussion, in the course ofwhich the PRIME MINISTER said that he was opposedto the setting up of a Cabinet Committee at thisstage, the Cabinet agreed:-(l)    To authorise the preparation of interim milk legislation on thelines summarised in paragraph18(a) of CoP. 128 (39), subject tothe point raised by the Presidentof the Board of Trade on para-graph (iv).(2)    To invite the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries and theecretary of State for Scotland^to prepare and submit to theCabinet a redraft of the statement to be made on the introduction ofthe proposed milk legislation as tothe attitude of the Government tofurther legislation next year,including the question of milkdistribution costs, on the lines suggested by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.
o U *MACHINE TOOLS.Question ofCosting.(previous reference:Cabinet 29(59), Con-clusion 6. )11.      The Cabinet had. before them a Memorandumby the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster(CP.  152(39)) in which he sought his colleagues&apos;approval of an agreement reached with the machine tools Trades Association on the question of theapplication of the principle of costing in the caseof machine tools supplied for the purposes of there-armament programme,,    The main points in theagreement (which had already received the approvalof the Minister of Supply Designate and representatives of the Service&apos; Departments and theTreasury) were the following:-    (l) acceptance ofthe principle of costing for non-standard articles(he. j articles other than those included in the published price lists); (2) agreement to a discountof 5 per cent0  for one year on programme suppliespaid for by the tax-payer and delivered after the 5thDecember, 1958;    (3) reservation of the position incase of special legislation being passed which would affect this problem.    The amount of money involvedin the 5 per cent,  discount was estimated to be atleast of the order of half a million pounds.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE DUCHY OP LANCASTERinvited the attention of his colleagues to the main features of the agreement reached with the machine tool Trades Association.    One feature of theagreement   to which he felt bound to draw attention was set out in paragraph (f) of the letter of the22nd May which provided that, while the arrangementremained in force until the 5th December, 1939,  itmight be subject to review in the event oflegislation being passed in the near future.
In the course of discussion, it was explained that the legislation here contemplatedwas not legislation relating to the profits of armament manufacturers hut to powers to enforcecostings.    In effect, this paragraph meant that,if the compulsory powers in regard to costingsprovided in the Ministry of Supply Bill were passed into law, and if, at a later stage, the Ministry ofSupply decided to exercise those powers, then, fromthe date from which such powers were exercised, theAssociation would cease to allow a 5 per cent,discount.In discussion, some doubt was expressedwhether this paragraph made it quite clear that the5 per cent, rebate would in any event be securedup to the date when costing powers were imposed.      Inview, however, of the circumstances of the case, itwas felt that it was undesirable to make, a further communication to the Association in order to obtain a further assurance on this point.The Cabinet took note of the Memorandumby the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster and approved the arrangementarrived at.
BARTERNEGOTIATIONSWITH THEUNITED STATES.12.      THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADEinvited the attention of his colleagues to thepresent position in regard to the discussionsproceeding with the United States Embassy as tothe possibility of bartering raw cotton for rubberon condition that the stocks so exchanged could he held by the United Kingdom and the United states government respectively for use in the event of a major war emergency.that His Majesty&apos;s Government should acquire underthese arrangements was 500,000 bales (which was estimated to be equivalent to six months&apos;requirements of American cotton in time of war).The proposal which had been discussed with theUnited States Embassy was that in return for500,000 bales of cotton His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould supply the United States Government withrubber to an equivalent value (approximately70,000 tons).United Kingdom negotiators   had made it clear(a) that any agreement would have to provide forsuitable arrangements in regard to&quot;shipping and(b) that in the event of the United StatesGovernment subsidising exports of raw cotton before they had delivered the 500,000 bales to us weshould want compensation in the form of additionalcotton.With regard to (a) the United Statesnegotiators had   now suggested that each Government   ii should take delivery of the commodity to be supplied;!by the other at the port of exportation (i.e.,Singapore for rubber and New Orleans for cotton) and),!The amount of cotton which it was decided in the course of the discussions the
that it should make itself responsible for transportingthe commodity to its own country, on the understandingthat, so far as practicable, the tonnage required wouldbe divided equally between British and American vessels.This had been represented as a concession to the UnitedKingdom, but preliminary enquiries indicated that nearly half of the rubber shipped from the Par Bast to theUnited States, and rather more than half of the cottonshipped from the United States to the United kingdom was normally carried in British vessels.The United States Government had in effectaccepted condition (b), which they also represented asa concession on their part.     They were pressing strongly that in consideration of these two concessions the scopeof the transaction should be increased and had suggestedtentatively that we should take 750,000 bales of cotton.The President said that there was perhaps a risk that if we adhered to the figure of 500,000 balesthe negotiations might break down.     He thought that,while 500,000 bales, which represented six months wartime consumption, was a proper and prudent provision tomake, it was difficult to justify an increase above this figure.      His opinion was that the United StatesGovernment would probably make an agreement on the basisof 500,000 bales, and he &quot;could not recommend an increaseabove that figure.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he had recently had-a conversation on this matter witljthe United States Ambassadoro     The latter had said thatthe negotiations were proceeding satisfactorily.     TheUnited States had made two concessions to us and hestressed with some emphasis that it was necessary that weshould make some advance if the negotiations were to go
f* r* oreally well.     He (the Foreign Secretary) had said thathe was not familiar with the details of the negotiations and had asked the American-Ambassador what he had inmind.     Mr. Kennedy replied that the United StatesGovernment had started by asking for an arrangement todeal with a million bales.     He now thought that thefigure of 650,000 bales v/ould do the trick.In the course of discussion, THE CHANCELLOR OFTHE EXCHEQUER enquired whether an increase to 650,000 baleswould involve increased demands for foreign exchange.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said thatthis would depend on the arrangements made for thepurchase of rubber.     The amount might be anything fromnothing up to  h00,000 as a maximum.     Further, any demandfor foreign exchange would be spread over a considerable period of time.THE PRIMS MINISTER said that he rather doubted whether we should obtain a definite quid pro quo for any increase over 500,000 bales.     For example, he doubted whether there would be any modification of the neutralitylegislation in our favour.     At the same time, it would bevery unfortunate if there was a breakdown of negotiations,or negotiation in a grudging spirit particularly at thepresent time, and he favoured an increase of the figure to650,000 bales.After further discussion, the cabinet agreed:(1)   That the figure of 500,000 bales as representing the amount of cottonto be purchased under the BarterNegotiations with the United states should be increased to 600,000 bales:
(2)    That in conveying this information toMr. Kennedy, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should indicate that thiswas the utmost concession which he had been able to obtain, and it had. beenobtained in response to Mr. Kennedy&apos;personal interventio.not he PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said thathe wished to invite his colleagues&apos; attention to one other feature of the proposed agreement.     This was thatit was impossible for us to buy the rubber which was tobe supplied to the United States until the agreement had besn ratified by the United States Senate.     this involved a risk that the rubber interests woALd try toput up the price against us3The President said that he had endeavoured tomeet this point by not fixing a precise date for delivery.The provisions in the agreement dealing with deliverytook the form that the.total quantity of rubber should be delivered within six months of the date of the firstdelivery for which no date was specifiede     He was anxiousto be in a position to inform the United States Governmentthat the Cabinet had been exercised over this point andhad attached importance to the provision attached todelivery being used by the two Governments in consultation,in order to prevent the price being put up against us.The Cabinet agreed to this course.
MILITARYTRAININGACT and reserve ANDAUXILIARYFORCES ACT.Cons equentialMatters to bedealt with byOrder inCouncil.(previous reference:Cabinet 31(39), Con-clusion 11.)15. THE CHANCELLOR OP THE DUCHY OP LANCASTERreminded his colleagues that the Ministerial Committeeof which he was Chairman had been authorised, at thelast Meeting of the Cabinet, to give the necessary instructions for printing and publication of theOrders without further reference to the Cabinet.The Committee had held two further Meetings and haddisposed of a large number of matters.   There were,however,  two outstanding points relating to (a) lifeinsurance policies, and (b)  industrial insurancepolicies, which had not yet been settled.    Thesematters had. been further discussed at a. Meeting heldat 9C45 that, morning.   He hoped that the second matter would, be disposed of inter-Departmentally, butconsiderable difference of opinion still existed onthe first matter.    He invited instructions as  to how this matter should be disposed of, in view of the factthat it was necessary that, the Orders should be sent for final printing that evening.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought it was undesirable that the whole Cabinet should be troubledwith the somewhat technical issues involved, and. he accepted a suggestion that the matter should bedecided by himself after hearing the -views, of theMinisters concerned.This  course was agreed to.Richmond Terrace, S.vV.1,14th June, 19390
