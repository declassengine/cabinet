SECRETARY OP I,    THE S^CR^TARY OP STAT&quot;^. FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSSTATE FORFOREIGN said that, subject to the approval of His MajestyAFFAIRS&apos;DINNER TO the King, he proposed to Rive the customary DinnerTHE diplomatic corps. to members of the Diplomatic Corps on Thursday, 8thJune.   He hoped that, his colleagues would be ableto attend and would make a note of the date.The Cabinet took note o^ this statement,-1-
IllS. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs gave his impressions of Herr Hitler&apos;s speech on the28th April-   He thought that it betrayed anxiety to justify past policy, especially the action takenin regard to Czechoslovakia, as being dictated byhistory, tradition, and the interests of peace.He thought that the speech also showed an anxiety to reconcile two main purposes:    first, a rebuketo democracy, intended for internal consumption?and, secondly, on practical grounds, to leave the floor open to possible future negotiations.    It mightbe held that the tone of the speech shower1 that therecent alignment of Powers had had a sobering effect.The Foreign Secretary sai^ that he had had along discussion on the previous day with Count Grandfmhe latter had informed him that when he had firstread Herr T-Titler&apos;s speech in Rome he had former! theimpression that it was very bellicose.   Later, awell-informed German had said to Count. Grandi thatthe speech had been more restrained than any othermade by Herr 7-Titler. After a re-reading. Count Grand!had some-hat  changer&apos; his earlier impressions of the speech.    It was, perhaps, a. habit of Dictators to conceal their actions behind a smoke-screen, which,in the present speech, took the form of denunciation of two Treaties.The speech included a studied effort to conciliate British public opinion by rather clumsyflattery.    In denouncing the Naval AgreementHerr Hitler had been careful to add that he was ready to enter into discussions with Great Britain^Similarly, in denouncing the Polish Pact and demand-ing the return of Danzig to the Reich, Herr Hitler
-MO110had adopted a cautious attitude to Poland and had left the door open for direct negotiations on a new basis.It was possible that Herr Hitler&apos;s aim was to testBritish and French support for Poland.    It looked as though the proposed new basis on which Herr Hitleroffered to negotiate might involve Poland dropping herrecent Pact with Great Britain and her Alliance with france.    It was also significant that the speechcontained a very restrained reference to Italy, whilepractically no reference was made to Russia.The Anglo- The Foreign Secretary said that the mainGermanNaval  - question to be considered was what action we shouldAgreement.take as the result of Herr Hitler&apos;s speech, and withregard to the Note which had been received denouncingthe Anglo-German Naval Agreement.    He thought that oneof our main objects should be to prevent Herr Hitlerassuming a role of injured innocence in the eyes ofhis own people and attempting to persuade germany that if war should follow the fault would lie withthe Western Powers.The Foreign Secretary said that, on thewhole, he thought it would be preferable that any statement which was now to be made should be made in answer to the Note denouncing the A*iglo-German naval agreement, and not in answer to Herr hitler speech.He suggested that the proposed statement should include the following points:   First, Germany hadno right to denounce the Agreement without previous
discussion. Secondly, the denunciation was based on a misconception of British policy.    Thirdly,this country&apos;s policy was anti-aggression and notanti-German.    Some reference could be made in thisconnection to Herr Hitler&apos;s denunciation of war.Fourthly, Herr Hitler had spoken of his readiness for a clear and practical understanding.    It mightbe considered whether we should ask him whatproposals he had in mind.The next point was whether the answer should take the form of a public speech by thePrime Minister, or of a Memorandum to the GermanGovernment, which could be published and broadcast.On the whole, he preferred a Memorandum to what he might term house-top diplomacy,,    A memorandum would, on the whole, be more difficult to answer.It was clear, however, that the Memorandum wouldrequire very careful preparation.The Foreign Secretary thought that adecision to send a reply would commend itself to all those v/ho did not hold, either that the common front which we had established constituted anadequate deterrent against German aggression, or that,whatever action we took, war was inevitable.    he himself held neither of these views.
% ii 0In the course of discussion, generalagreement v/as. expressed with the view that someanswer should be made, to the Note denouncing theAnglo-German Naval Agreement.     Doubt was expressed asto the advisability of going so far as to ask herr hitler what proposals he had in mind.     The foreign secretary thought that Herr Hitler might say that,if we would allow him a free hand in Eastern Europe,he would not press his demand for the return ofGermany4s former Colonies.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed with this view.His main anxiety in this matter was lest Herr Hitlershould represent to his people that Great Britainwanted war with Germany, was refusing his generousoffers, and v/as aiming at a policy of encirclement.This would be very fertile matter for propagandainside Germany.Reference was made to a possible demand fora return of Germany1s Colonies.      It was pointed outthat proposals in regard to the Colonial question had been made to Germany over a year ago.     Theseproposals had been made on the 3rd March, 1938, onthe eve of the German invasion of Austria.     no reply had ever been received to these proposals,THE PRIME MINISTER said that in his view itwas quite impossible to discuss with Germany anyquestion of the return of her Colonies at thepresent time, and that nothing should be said whicllwould imply that v/e were prepared to do so.     he pointed out, however,  that British industrialists
had recently been engaged in promising trade negotiations with Germany which had been broken off at the time of the German occupation of Czechoslovakia.He thought that.within a reasonable time, if therewas no further disturbance in international affairs,these trade negotiations v/ith Germany might be resumed.     He agreed that Herr Hitler&apos;s heart was in eastern Europe and that lie was not really much concerned about the return to Germany of tho formerColonies.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER thought that our reply should be restricted to a rather narrow field.Herr Hitler had attempted to persuade the Germanpeople that he had justification for his actionin breaking the Anglo-German Naval Agreement,     Thehistory of this matter was not well-known and shouldbe made quite clear.     This might lead on to a definition of our aims.     Pie thought, therefore, thatwe should confine ourselves to ground covered by herr Hitler&apos;s speech and by the Note denouncing theAnglo-German Naval Agreement, and. that our answer should make it clear that we had in no way modified our policy   of supporting peace and endeavouring to stopaggression,THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that atthe present time Germany v/as building warships as fast as she could but that she would not be able to exceed the 35 per cent.- ratio before 1942 or 1943.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF defence said that Herr Hitler was ;:ow taking the view., or
had perhaps persuaded himself, that when he had made &quot;the Anglo-German Naval Agreement he had expected us to allow him a free hand in eastern europe.     The Agreement had thus, in lierr Hitler1 view, &quot;been made on an implied assumption which wecould not accept.In discussion it was pointed out that no indication had ever been given at the time whenthe Naval Agreement was signed that it was basedon any such assumption.     Indeed, the Naval Agreementbelonged to the period when discussions were takingplace as to limitations on Germans&apos;-1 s army and airforce as well as on Germany1s navy.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the first timethe idea of a free hand in Eastern Europe had been mentioned was, he thought, at his interview with herr Hitler at Berchtesgaden.     He did not thinkthat any useful purpose would be served by reachinganother Naval Agreement with Herr 531 tier.     In thefirst place, there was no assurance that the agreement would be kept, and secondly it was certain that herr hitler would not sign any Agreement unless it provided for some much higher ratio than 35 per cent.He thought, however, that without going so far assigning a fresh Naval treaty, it might be useful tohave some understanding with Germany in regard toa Naval qualitative limitation agreement.      Suchan undertaking might well affect other Pov/ers, aswell as Germany.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR SCOTLAND thoughtthat, for propaganda purposes, it would be undesirable
1 n&apos; 11 fj fcito ignore altogether Herr Eitier.&apos;s offer of negotiations made in the concluding section of theHote denouncing the Anglo-German naval- Agreement.-It was felt however that this point required further?considernation as there was a risk that if the point was stressed, it would have a discouraging effect on public opinion in this country.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY summed up thediscussion as follows:-(1) The answer/er should take the form ofa Note.(2) The contents of the Note should herestricted as suggested by theChancellor of the Exchequer at (A)above, that is to say, it shouldbe confined to clearing up theposition in regard to the denunciation of the Anglo-G-erman Naval Agreementwith a statement of our positive policy.The Note should not end on a note of interrogation but consideration should be given to the point mentioned by the Secretary of State for Scotland*TJ.3D PRIME MINISTER expressed agreement withthis view.     What we required was a clear expositionof our own policy.     While he agreed that our reply should take the form of a Note, he pointed outthat he was due to make a speech in the Albert Hallon Thursday,  the 11th May and that he could include some reference to the matter on that occasion.The Cabinet agreed:(1) To invite the Foreign Secretary to draft a Note on the lines indicated above in reply to the German Note ofdenunciation of the Anglo-german naval Agreement:(2) That a draft of the Note should thenbe    submitted to the Committee onForeign Policy.
JL ij &apos;Ji3. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he was somewhat anxious over the positionof Danzig, which he regarded as a danger point.Colonel Beck was to make a speech on Friday.     TheForeign Secretary said that he had sent a member ofthe Foreign Office to Geneva to meet Herr Burckhardt,the High Commissioner for Danzig.     He had alsoinvited the Counsellor at our Embassy in Warsaw toreturn to London for consultation.It was, of course, clear that ColonelBeolc was not anxious for war, and that if warresulted over Danzig, Poland would have to bear the brunt of it.      Colonel Beck was believed to be somewhatpro-German.     On the other hand, public opinion in Poland was now aroused and there were all themakings of trouble.     It was also rather disquietingthat Colonel Beck, when he had visited this country,had not given us details of the German offer overDanzig, though he had since done so.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY thought that itwould be dangerous to allow ourselves to get intoa position in which the issues of peace and wardepended solely on the judgment of the PolishGovernment.     The undertaking which we had given to poland had been qualified by two conditions, firstthat Polish independence was clearly threatened; and secondly that Poland resisted the threat with hernational forces.     The first of these conditionsgave us some right to exercise our own judgment on thematter.
On the other hand, it was of the utmost importance that no action or words of ours should suggest that we were trying to whittle away theundertaking which we had given.       He therefore proposed to telegraph to Warsaw on the following lines:He would say that public opinion here was concerned over the situation, and that therewas a measure of anxiety lest the Polish attitudemight he intransigent.     At the same time, he wouldmake it clear that we adhered to our guarantee.We held, the view, however, that the mere fact thatwe had given the guarantee gave us the right to hekept informed as to any situation which arose,  just aswe should regard ourselves hound to give information to Poland if we were likely to he attacked in circumstances which would bring into effect the undertaking which Poland had given, to us.     Thestatement v/ould, of course, require very carefuldrafting.The Foreign Secretary said that Lord Perthhad told him that Herr Hitler&apos;s offer, if correctlyreported, was one which, if it had been made 10years ago, would willingly have been accepted byPoland.In reply to questions the Foreign secretary said that the fact that he was rapporteuron the Danzig question to the Council of the League,was a point which was also of value.      It was his intention that his telegram should reach colonel beck before Friday, and should make it clear thathis speech should not include any irrevocable decisionsbefore we had been consulted.
THE PRIME MINISTER said that lie had &quot;been much &apos;concerned to hear of   a    statement broadcast by theB,B,C, on Sunday night to the effect that thiscountry left it entirely to Poland to determine what attitude she should adopt in regard toDanzig and the Corridor.     Such a statement was,of coux&quot;se, entirely incorrect.     It was verydifficult to be sure whether the inclusion of danzig in the Reich would constitute a threat toPolish independence.      The answer to that questionreally depended on Germany1 s intentions.       Hethought that public opinion would be shocked ifGerman demands in regard to Danzig were completelyconceded without any attempt at proper negotiation.Squally, public opinion would be disturbed, andrightly so, if we left it entirely in Poland&apos;s power &quot;to Involve us in a major European war.     He thoughtthat a communication on the lines suggested by theForeign Secretary was desirable in order to make sure that Poland&apos;s attitude was not provocative.In the course of discussion, the question was raised whether a communication on ths lines proposed by the Foreign Secretary would import some new condition into the undertaking which we had given to Poland,      It was explained that this wasnot the case.      Suppose, for example, Poland became involved in a war as the result of some triflingfrontier incident, should we be bound to go to hei*assistance?    The answer to this was obviously in the negative.     This meant that we must have the rightto express an opinion whether Poland&apos;s claim on usto implement our guarantee in any given circumstanceswas, or was not, well-founded.     The same was, ofcourse, true of the other guarantees which we had given.
IllAt the same time, it was agreed that the telegram to Warsaw would, require very carefuldrafting, and it&apos; was suggested that the matter wasone which should, if possible, he considered by theForeign Policy Committee.     In view of the short time available, it was found difficult to arrange ameeting at a Convenient time, but it was agreed thatthe draft telegram should be circulated to the membersof the Foreign Policy Committee for their observations,and that a meeting should then be held if necessary.THE LORD CHANCELLOR asked&apos; whether theForeign Secretary could arrange for the circulation to the Cabinet of a Memorandum explaining what wouldbe the effect of the concession of Herr Hitler&apos;demands in regard to:(1) Danzig^(2) The Autostrada and other communicationsacross the corridorcon Polish independence.The Foreign Secretary undertook to arrangefor this to be done.The Cabinet agreed:-(l)   To approve the general lines of the telegram which the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs proposed to send to our Ambassador at Warsaw in regardto: p,anzig.(2)   That the draft telegram should be circulated to members of the ForeignPolicy Committee for their observations.(3)    To invite the Foreign Secretary toarrange for the circulation of aMemorandum explaining what effect the concession   of Herr Hitler&apos;s demands in regard to Danzig and the corridorwould have on Polish independence.
4. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that the Cabinet would have seen the telegram which had been sent to Paris (No, 186) replying to theFrench Government!s proposals and making counter-proposals.   We had received an interim reply from M,Bonnet to the effect that he was prepared to accept our proposals provided Russia would accept them(telegram No, 192 from Paris),   A formal reply fromthe French Government had been promised yesterday, but had not yet been received.   We had informed the Polish and Roumanian Governments of the general view we were taking in this matter.   While the Polish Government werein agreement with us, the Roumanian Government&apos;s reply had been somewhat hesitant, pending the return ofM.. Gafencu to BucharestThe Foreign Secretary reminded his colleagues that Russia&apos;s proposal was for a tri-partite pactbetween Great Britain, France and Russia,    Brieflyour view was that this scheme raised serious difficulties and we were asking Russia whether she would be preparedto make a unilateral declaration that she would givehelp, at such time and in such form as might be acceptable to Poland and Roumania, if circumstancesarose which brought into force the guarantees that wehad given to those countries^The Foreign Secretary said that he had had discussions on the matter the previous day with Mr*Winston Churchill who was entirely in favour of theproposed tri-part*Lte part.    The views which he had put to Mr, Churchill as to the effect on a number of othercountries of such a proposal had left him quiteunmoved.
Continuing, the Foreign Secretary said thathis own views had not changed.   He thought thata tri-partite pact on the lines proposed, would makewar inevitable.    On the other hand, he thought thatit was only fair to assume that if we rejected Russia1sproposal, Russia would sulk.    There was also always the hare possibility that a refusal of Russia&apos;s offermight even throw her into Germany 5s arms.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that Canada was strongly opposed to any alliance with Russia, and in South Africa General Hertzog hadvolunteered a statement on the same lines.   He had had no indication as yet of the views of the otherDominions.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that Japan was at present resisting the blandish*ments of the Axis, but if we made a pact which includedRussia this might well influence her attitude.    Theeffect on Portugal and Italy would also be unfortunate.It was weHtoremember that the feeling of large numbersof people in Europe, which had been nearer to Communismthan this country, were strongly hostile to Russia.He added that he had received&apos; a long letter fromCardinal Hinsley, expressing anxiety on this matter.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that although the idea might seem fantastic at the moment,the natural orientation suggested an arrangement between Germany and Russia.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that theconclusion by this country of a pact with Russia would create great difficulties for- us in Spain, a country which was of great strategical importance to us.
11&apos; umJ&amp;L- Jsa.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEconfirmed this view.     On the other hand, if Germany wereto make some form of military alliance with Russia^ Itwould decrease the risk that Japan would make amilitary pact with Germany.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES saidthat he was in general agreement with the foreign secretary&apos;s views.   At the same time, we did not wishto give offence to Russia, and weHiropefd^-^feha-t if war^ame^w^^sh^Q^?&quot;&apos;^^ .....on our&quot; oide-.   He therefore asked whether it would not he possible to keepnegotiations continuing for some further period.^THE PRIME MINISTER said that no decision was called for at the present time.   We were at presentawaiting a formal reply from the French Government.When that had been received, we should send a replyto the Russian Government, setting out our counterproposals.   He assumed that the Russian Governmentwould not thereupon break off negotiations, but would send a further communication.The Cabinet took note of the above statement.
11.PALESTINE       5. The Cabinet again had before them the following draft White   Memoranda by the Secretary of State for the Colonies:-Paper. -(l) CP.-79 (39)5 covering a draft(Previous White Paper on Policy in Palestine:Refsconce*Cabinet 25 (2) CP.-97 (39), covering a list of(39), Con- proposed amendments to the draftelusion 1(3)) White Paper .PR. 7--j(htj)&quot;] -   The further consideration of &apos; these papers and in particular of the proposed amendments dealing with our\ strategicalrequirements, had been deferred at the Meeting mentioned inthe margin.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES referred tothe three points on which the representatives of the neighbouring Arab States had asked for further concessions.He had informed the Cabinet at their last Meeting of the answers which had been given in regard to these points.These answers had been accepted by the representatives cbfthe neighbouring Arab States, and at that time it had appeared that they would be prepared to issue a joint statement in support of the White Paper, inviting the palestinian Arabs to accept its terms.    At this stage,however, the representatives of the neighbouring arab states had5 contrary to our wishes, invited representativesOf the Palestinian Arabs to Cairo.    This had resulted in astiffening of their attitude.    As a consequence a telegram had been received from Cairo (No.303) to the effect thatthe representatives of the neighbouring Arab States wereprepared to advise the Palestinian Arabs to co-operate inthe establishment of an independent Palestine State,subject to four further points which are set out below.&quot;(l) Immediately after the restorationof peace and security a Ministry
for us to undertake that agreement could be reached^Arab and Jewish W^h^k^^^^j^^^s^ Sj-&quot;/^a  kd&amp;^*&amp;- ^H^.oZ^^&quot;(4)    The Arab States hope that within thenext three years, after peace andorder have been established, a constituentassembly will be formed for the purposeo  drawing up a Constitution.&quot;Our intention had been that after five years thereshould be an inquiry by experts, whose findingswould be put to a Constituent Assembly.Summarising the matter, the Colonial Secretaryanticipated no serious difficulty in points (2),(3) and (4), but felt it was essential to stand- 17 -should he formed of Palestinianswith British advisers to co-operate in the administration of the country.,&quot;This was quite contrary to the arrangement previouslycontemplated^ which was that, after peace had been restored, a limited number of Departments would be placed under Palestinians who would act in an advisory capacity,&quot;(2)jSfumber of Jewish immigrants withinthe next five years should notexceed 75,000 and proportion of theJewish population in Palestine should in no way exceed one third of the whole population.&quot;This point did not present any serious difficulties., The number of 75,00P had already been accepted as our wj^Im^u^ogprmflMulm11 aii^       The Egyptian Prime Minister had,however, explained that the Palestinian Arabs were anxious that a census should be held at once.     It was clear,however, that an accurate census could not be carried out at the present time, and the suggestion would be refused.&quot;(3)    The question of sale of lands shouldbe settled by mutual understanding between the High Commissioner and the palestinian Ministers.&quot;We had always had it in mind that full consultationshould take place on this matter.     It must, however,be made clear that by &quot;full consultation&quot; we did notnecessarily mean &quot;agreement&quot;.     It was indeed impossible
firm on point (l)0     This might mean that the neighbouring Arab States would now cease to regard themselves as bound by their informal agreement, andwould no longer make a declaration in the terms proposed.The likelihood of this happening would be increased if we now made a statement saying that the Mufti would beindefinitely excluded from Palestine,      On the other hand,it was possible that these fresh points might have been raised in an endeavour to secure better terms by haggling.The Colonial Secretary said that he would not regard the failure of the representatives of the neighbouring Arab States to make a declaration as a veryserious matter.      It was clear that they were all anxious that a settlement of the Palestinian problem should bereached.     For example, the Prime Minister of Egypt was anxious that the troops on loan from Egypt to palestine should return to Egypt as soon as possible.     Again,the vast majority of the Arabs in Palestine would recognise that the proposals in the White Paper hadremoved their main fears.     They were clearly anxious tocall off the rebellion, and would be strengthened inthis view if we took a firm decision about the Mufti.It seemed that the rebellion, which had already slackenedcould   not be kept going without support from outside.The Colonial Secretary therefore favoured the publicationof the White Paper, subject to the settlement of further details, at an early date      Looking at the matter fromthe point of view of Palestine only, he regarded everyday&apos;s delay as unfortunate.     His first idea had,therefore, been publication on Wednesday, 10th May.      Onthe other hand, the Report of the Commission which had visited British Guiana had just been received, and the
Report, which was in somewhat general terms, was, onthe whole, more favourable than had been anticipated.While the members of the Commission did not commit themselves definitely, they thought that there were goodpossibilities of agricultural and industrial development in the areas which they had visited.     They suggestedthat a trial settlement of 3,000 to 5,000 people shouldbe carried out in the next year or so, at a costestimated at three million dollars.     This matter wasbeing discussed in the Colonial Office,     If a statement could be made early in the week after, at the same time as the publication of the White Paper on Palestine, itwould be helpful.     He therefore proposed that theWhite Paper should be published on Monday, the 15th May,THE PRIME MINISTER said that, looking at thematter from the House of Commons point of view, he would prefer Monday, 15th May,Reference was again made to the question of Britishstrategical requirements in Palestine,      It was agreedthat this matter should be further discussed by theCabinet Committee,The Cabinet -(l) took note of the statement made bythe Secretary of State for theColonies:(S) agreed that, subject to further developments, the White Paper ohPolicy in Palestine should bepublished on Monday, the 15th May;(5) remitted to the Palestine Committee -(a) consideration of further amendments to the draft White Paper, and inparticular(b) consideration of any amendmentsnecessary to safeguard ourstrategical interests.
.6.      THE PRIME MINISTER reminded his colleagues that at the meeting of the Cabinet referred to in the margin, it had been decided that Clause 15 of the Bill,which gave power to extend the Bill to Northern Ireland,should stand as drafted, and the Home Secretary hadbeen asked to invite Lord Craigavon to come over tothis country for consultation.The previous morning the Home Secretary had seen Lord Craigavon and he had heard from Mr. Dulanty,who had informed him that he had been instructed to fly over to Dublin, to see Mr. de Valera, and toreturn with a personal message to the Prime Minister,to be delivered at 10 p.m. on the same night.The Home Secretary, after having seen lord craigavon, had reported to the Prime Minister that lord craigavon had been prepared to agree to leave a decisionon this matter to His Majesty&apos;s Government.     At thesame time, he had expressed a strong hope that theNorthern Irish Horse should be revived as a mechanisedunit, as this action would appeal strongly to NorthernIrish sentiment.     His colleagues were much indebted tothe Home Secretary for the way in which he had handledthe matter.The Prime Minister said that later in the day he had seen Lord Craigavon who had appeared ratherreluctant to adhere to his decision to leave the questiorwhether the Act should apply to Northern Ireland to besettled by His Majesty&apos;s Government.     The draft statement for publication which Lord Craigavon had shown him had merely referred to his offer to place theresources of Ulster at the disposal of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, and to enquiries as to how Ulster could

Eventually, however, the Prime Minister hadpersuaded him to add words to the statement to the effectthat he would leave a   decision on the matter to HisMajesty&apos;s Government.     He thought that Lord Craigavon&apos;strue attitude was that, while he was prepared to acquiesce in a decision to exclude Northern Ireland fromthe scope of the Bill, he was not prepared to say so inadvance.Lord Craigavon had later seen the UlsterMembers of Parliament, who, as might be expected, wouldbe opposed to the exclusion of Ulster from the scope ofthe Bill.While Lord Oraigavon was with him, he (thePrime Minister) had consulted the War Office on the telephone, and the War Office had agreed to there constitution of the Northern Irish Horse as a mechanisedRegiment.     This speedy decision had been a great help to him in his discussions with Lord Craigavon.     Thelatter had also mentioned the possibility that ifcompuls%cn was enforced on irishmen in this country alarge number of them would go across to Northern Ireland,where they would obtain relief of some kind.     lord craigavon thought that consideration should be given to measures to prevent this happening.The Prime Minister said that he had thoughtit best not to see Mr. Dulanty the previous evening, ashe wished to be in a position to announce a cabinet decision when he saw the High Commissioner for Eire.
He had &quot;been in consultation with the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs and the Home Secretary on thewhole matter, and had reached the conclusion that the&quot;best plan would be to exclude Northern Ireland from theoperation of the Bill.     He thought that a decision tothis effect, if agreed upon, could best be made in his. opening speech in the Second Reading of the Bill onThursday, where he could introduce this matter in proper perspective.If it was decided to exclude Northern Irelandfrom the operation of the Act, the next question was whether the powers of Clause 15 to extend the Bill inIreland by Order-in-Council should stand or be deleted.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER explainedthat he thought an amendment would also be necessaryin Clause 1 (l) which referred to &quot;every male british subject in the United Kingdom&quot;.THE HOME SECRETARY said that on the whole he thoughtthat, the best plan would be to delete, from 1he Bill the provision to enable it to be extended to Northern Ireland.. Otherwise, therewas a danger lest we should get the worst of both worlds cand not obtain the benefit of voluntary recruitment from NorthernIreland which might well give.us as much as we could have obtained by means of compulsion.The Cabinet agreed:(1)   That the Military Training Billshould not extend to NorthernIreland.(2)   That the provisions of the bill which gave power to extend theI Act to Northern Ireland shouldbe deleted.
(3)   That a decision on this matter should he announced by thePrime Minister in his opening speech on the Second Reading ofthe Bill on Thursday, the hth May,. (U)   To invite the Home Secretary, inconsultation with the other ministers concerned, to consider what means should he adopted toprevent Irishmen resident in thiscountry, who became liable to theoperation of the Bill fromproceeding to Northern Ireland to escape their obligations.Conscientious THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said thatObjectors.Lord Salisbury, who had occupied the position of chairman of the Central Tribunal in the last war, had represented to him that it was desirable that theChairman of the Appellate Tribunal set up under part IJof the Schedule, and possibly also the Chairmen of theLocal Tribunals, should be lay persons who would appreciate at their true value the objections to military service on moral grounds felt by conscientious objectors.     Lord Salisbury thought that this was moreimportant than any- legal qualifications.It was agreed:That this point should be further considered, with a view to suitableamendments to Part II of the Schedulebeing introduced when the Bill was in committee.
COMPULSORY 7.      The Cabinet had under consideration theMILITARYTRAINING. question of the pay and conditions of service of  persons to be enlisted under the Military TrainingPay and Bill, which had already been discussed at the MeetingConditionsof Service, referred to in the margin, in connection with the(Previous       draft of the Financial and Explanatory MemorandumReference:Cabinet 25   (CP.  102-A (39)) to accompany the Military Training(39), Con-elusion 4. ) Bill, but had been reserved for further considerationER..Z*&amp;l$ ))&apos;,o. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said thatthis matter had been the subject of further discussion and he now put forward the following proposals.    These proposals represented a comprehensive plan which he hoped would prove acceptable:(l) The pay of the conscript to be 1/- a daythroughout his initial continuous periodof training of six months.    No additionfor acting ranks or trades.(2) The weekly stoppages for barrack damages,games and health insurance to be found from Army Votes and not from the conscripts&apos;pay.(3) For the subsequent period of 3-g- years inthe Auxiliary Service, his pay to be thesame as that for the volunteer, except thathe would not be entitled to the specialadditions by way of proficiency pay, bounty,etc., which the volunteer at present enjoys.(4) The wives of conscripts to be treatea asdependants.    Dependants to be eligiblefor grants of 17/- a week for total dependancyor 12/- for partial dependency, subject to therules which govern the issue of dependants&apos;allowances in the draft Y7ar Warrant.(5) All entrants for continuous training in thethree respective Services to be treated onthe same footing in the matter of pay andconditions of service.    If the Air force or the Navy decide to take men before theage of 20, thus escaping their liabilityat the age of 20, this must be regarded asan anticipation of the statutory liability,not qualifying for exceptional treatment inthe matter of pay, etc.(6) The age of entitlement in the Regular and auxiliary Services to family allowance tobe reduced to 20.
The following are the main points dealtwith in discussion:1* The pay of a conscript to he l/- a day throughouthis initial continuous period of training for six months.While one or two members of the Cabinetexpressed some regret, the general view was thatthis rate was one v/hich could properly be defendedin all the circumstances.    As regards any difficulties with Trade Unions,  it was not thoughtthat the difference between 1/- and 2/- a day wouldbe material,2. Weekly stoppages.This proposal was accepted.3&quot; Payment during the subsequent period of 5-g years&apos;service.THE SECRETARY OP STATS POR WAR said thatlogically there was, no doubt, a good case for theChancellor&apos;s proposals that persons enlisted underthe Military Training Act should not reeeivespecial additions by way of proficiency pay, bounty,etc.    These were in a sense an inducement tovolunteers to render themselves proficient or tocomply with certain conditions during the training.At the same time, the Chancellor&apos;s proposals wouldresult in creating two different classes, a resultwhich he strongly deprecated.THE MINISTER OP AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIESpointed out that attendance at a fortnight&apos;s camp,while serving as a Territorial, often resulted in financial hardship which it was desirable to alleviate.It was agreed that this matter should befurther discussed by the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Ministers in charge ofthe Service Departments.
lu   Allowances for wives and mechanics.6.   Reduction to 20 of age of entitlement to family allowances. &quot;THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said thathe was not clear why the Chancellor should give theRegular soldier an entitlement to receive marriage allowance at the age of 20.    Prom the public,pointsAof view, he thought that it would he better thatallowances at this age should only be payable incase of need.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR said that he thoughtthat, in the case of persons called up under theMilitary Training Bill for six months&apos;  continuousservice, these allowances would be payable in asmall number of cases.    He doubted whether any advantage would ensue from making such cases subjectto investigation of need.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that&apos;,   .while payment of marriage allowance might be madedependent upon investigation of need in the case ofpersons called up under the Military Training Bill,he did not think this position could be maintained inregard to the Regular Services.In the course of further discussion, theview was taken that, while there might bejustification for dispensing with investigation of need with regard to marriage allowances payable to persons called up for six months&apos;  continuous training under the Military Training Bill, and to members of theRegular Forces, it was necessary to insist uponinvestigation of need in the case of allowances forother dependants.    In this connection, it was pointedout that allowances were not payable to Regulars fordependants other than wives and children.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs referred to the suggestion which he had made at theprevious meeting of the Cabinet that, while marriageallowances should he paid to persons called up underthe Military Training Act and married on the date of theAct coming into force, it should he announced that nosuch allowance would he paid to persons married thereafter.A considerable measure of sympathy was expressed withthis suggestion, but it was not felt that it was the onewhich could be adopted in practice.5. All entrants for oontinuous training in thethree Services to be treated on the same footing,in the matter of pay and conditions of service.&quot;THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that theannual intake required by his Department under the Actwould not be more than 4,000 or 5,000 men.     The speciaX.position of the R.A.F. under any system of compulsory service had always been recognised.     To continue to givepay and allowances at existing rates to all the men con-cerned would involve a sum not exceeding  65,000 a year.The matter, however, was one of special importance, havingregard to the position of the Air Force in regard to any system of conscription.     Every member of the Air Force,except members of the Balloon Defences, had a liability to go into the air.     This obligation rendered it essentialespecially in the case of pilots and members of aircrews, that they should be volunteers, and that the specialrisk attaching to their duties should be recognised inrelation to pay.     Experience had shown that, in orderto attract the personnel required, relatively high ratesof pay had to be offered, e.g. sergeants received 10/6a day and sergeant-pilots 12/6 a day.
It was most important to recognise that theRoyal Air Force was a Volunteer Force and thatcompulsion played no part in it.      In Germany, the AirForce was a volunteer one.    In France and Poland,inducements were offered to men   to volunteer for airservice before they reached conscription age, and suchvolunteers received financial inducements which theyretained when they reached the age of conscription.In conclusion, the Secretary of State for Airsaid that it was most essential that the normal ratesat present prevailing should continue to he paid torecruits for the Auxiliary Air Force and to the RoyalAir Force Volunteer Reserve, and that such rates shouldnot be reduced to l/- a day during the period of con-tinuous training which recruits to these Services wouldundergo under the new arrangements.     Above all, it wasnecessary not to jeopardise the volunteer character ofthe Force.In the discussion which ensued, the CHANCELLOROF THE EXCHEQUER raised the question whether all the personnel engaged in ground maintenance,  etc. in the AirForces to which reference   had been made were, in fact,liable to go into the air and were all, in fact, treatedas volunteers.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR referred to theimportance of mechanics who were liable to be called to fly going up in the aeroplanes for whose maintenancethey were responsible.The question whether it was necessary that theRoyal Air Force should recruit for the Auxiliary Forceand the Volunteer Reserve any persons who were liableto the obligations imposed by the Act was also raised.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that theposition of a man who entered the Territorial Force androse to he a sergeant, and was then liable to, undergo a period Of six months&apos;  compulsory training under theBill, was similar  o that put forward by the Secretaryof State for Air, although the financial sacrificemight not be so large.It was agreed that this matter should befurther discussed.The Cabinet agreed:-That the proposals made by the Chancellorof the Exchequer   set out above shouldbe further discussed departmentally,with a view to settlement being reached on all outstanding points of importance,before the Second Reading of the Billon Thursday,  the 4th May.
$FENCEREPARATIONS:.GRICULTURE.ixpansion of&apos;oodreductionn Time of&apos;ar.previous reference:Cabinet 13 (39),Conclusion 3).8. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries(CP.-103(39)) in which it was stated that, at aMeeting on 18th April of the Committee of ImperialDefence Sub-Committee on Food Supply in Time of War,it had been agreed in principle (F.S.9th Meeting,Conclusion (I)(e)), that certain further steps shouldbe taken to improve the food position of thiscountry in time of war0      The details of the measuresto be taken had subsequently been examined by an inter-Departmental Committee, and in the light of thatexamination the Minister had drafted a Statement (acopy of which was attached to his Memorandum) which he proposed, with the concurrence of his colleagues, tomake that day in the House of Commons, as a matter of urgency, in order that action on the lines suggestedmight be taken this summer.The draft Statement included an announcement that the Government proposed to ask Parliament toauthorise the payment of contributions of  2 per acrein respect of permanent grassland ploughed up afterthe announcement and before the 30th September 1939,and brought into a state of cleanliness and fertilityby fallowing, re-seeding or sowing to an approved crop.It was pointed out that the terms of theStatement had been approved by the Treasury, but thatthe Secretary of State for Scotland had reserved hisposition as he was not yet satisfied that in all respects the proposals were suited to conditions inScotland,
THE MINISTER OP AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES saidthat there had been considerable pressure for astatement on the lines proposed.     He hoped that thestatement would serve a double purpose.     First, itwould show that plans were ready to be put intoforce if war should break out.     Secondly, it would give an indication to farmers that there was useful work whichthey could do in advance of an outbreak of war.     Themain feature of his proposals was the payment of  2 anacre in respect of permanent grass-land ploughed up before the 30th September,1939.     His proposals had beenaccepted by the Treasury and the Committee of ImperialDefence.     He asked for authority to make theannouncement that afternoon, subject to certain detaileddrafting amendments.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he had accepted the plan on the assurance that the arrangementasked for would only apply to the current summer, and thata repetition of it would not be asked for in the ensuing year unless, of course, war broke out in themeantime.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES agreedthat this was so.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that,owing to the different climatic conditions in Scotland,he felt some doubt whether the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries&apos; scheme would be of much assistance to scotland without some adjustment of dates.     He raised noobjection to the statement but he hoped that theChancellor of the Exchequer would agree to leave open for consideration, before the introduction of legislation the question of some small adjustment of dates to suitScottish conditions.
The Cabinet -(l) authorised the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries to make an announcement that afternoon, on the lines proposedin CP. 103 (39)o(2) noted that the Secretary of State forScotland reserved his position,as he was not yet satisfied that theproposals were in all respects suited to conditions in Scotland.
fORPORALfuNISHMENT.previous reference:Cabinet 291 Conclusion 8).9o     The Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Home Secretary (CoP.-98 (39)), in which it was recalled that, in accordance with the Conclusion noted inthe margin, the Criminal Justice Bill contained a Clauseproposing to abolish corporal punishment as a Court^31^39) )3.    penalty,,      In Standing Committee the Clause had beencarried by 32 votes to 17, the majority consisting mainly of members of the Opposition Parties.     Since the bill had been reported by the Standing Committee, however, theHome Secretary had been supplied confidentially with alist of some 203 members of the Conservative   Party whointended, during the Report Stage, to support an amendment to delete the Clause in question, and he understood thata considerable number of other members desired theretention of corporal punishment.      The Home Secretaryasked for the advice of his colleagues as to the line heshould pursue when the Clause came up for discussion onthe floor of the House.      His own view was that theprinciple of abolition must be maintained.      To meet the critics of the Government^ proposal, however, hesuggested that abolition should, in the first instance, beintroduced for an experimental period of, say, five years.At the end of that time it would be for Parliament todecide, in the light of the experience gained and of thepublic feeling then prevailing, whether or not it shouldbe made permanent.      The Home Secretary accordinglyattached to his Memorandum a draft amendment to the Clause,the effect of which would be to suspend for a period offive years the existing power of the Cour&apos;s to passsentences of corporal punishment.      If the Cabinet agreedto make some concession on the lines of the proposed
amendment, he suggested that the hest means of dealingwith the matter would be for a Private Member to putdown an amendment to the Clause., which could beaccepted by him, if the debate showed that the House wasin favour of corporal punishment being suspended for aperiod.THE HOME SECRETARY asked the Cabinet to give him liberty of action to deal with the matter on thelines proposed, after discussion with the Chief Whip.In the course of discussion, doubt was expressed whether the proposal set out in the HomeSecretary&apos;s Memorandum (viz., a draft amendment to suspend for five years the existing power of the courts to pass sentences of corporal punishment) would beaccepted.     It was therefore suggested that it mightbe better to leave the matter to a free vote of theHouse.The Cabinet invited the Home Secretary tocontinue discussions on this matter withthe Chief Whip and to make a further report,to the Cabinet.- 3k -

He thoughtthat at present the only Departments,  in addition tothose which had a Resident Cleric or an equivalentarrangement, who should be required to have an officersleeping on the premises were the Home Office and the offices of the Cabinet and Committee of Imperial Defence.In regard to the other Departments concerned, he thoughtthat it would suffice if Departments adopted, what wascommonly known as a &quot;Duty Officer&quot; arrangement.      Underthis plan a Duty Officer was appointed for each periodof 24 hours.      This Duty Officer must be available atall times on the telephone, and was required to sleepwithin a reasonable distance of the office,  say, a distance which could be covered within half an hour.The Cabinet agreed to the Minister1sproposal, and authorised the Secretaryto issue the necessary instructions tothe Departments concerned,Ri richmond Te rrace, s.
