0 0o 9PALESTINE. 1. In continuation of the Conclusion noted inDraft White Paper, the margin, the Cabinet had before them the following memoranda by the Secretary of State for theColonies:-(previous reference:Cabinet 24 (39),Conclusion 6.)(l)   CP.-79 (39), covering a draft white paper on Policy in Palestine:(2)   CP.-97 (39), covering a list of proposed amendments to the draft White Paper:together with(3)   A Memorandum by the Minister of Health(cp-lOO (39) in which it was suggestedthat the whole problem should be reviewedafresh in the light of the existing situation and not merely on the basis ofthe proposals as they had recentlydeveloped.     His suggestions were:-(a) that we should declare that it wasnot possible at the present timeto proceed further with theconsideration of far-reachingconstitutional changes;(b) that we should strengthen our forces in Palestine, byadvancing in date such measures as v/e should have in any case to take if Italian pressurecontinued to develop;(c) that we should meanwhile work inpractice towards a federalsolution, the essential features of which must be the segregation&amp;&amp; far as possible of Jews and arabs;(d) that we should neither take norannounce any steps which would lead to an administrativeposition in which either ofthese races would have to be governed by the other.
o0THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the cabinet should deal first with the Minister of Health&apos;s paper which raised the issue whether an announceraent of HisMajesty&apos;s Government&apos;s policy in regard to palestine should be made in the near future,THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR THE COLONIES said that further telegrams had just been received that morningfrom our Ambassador at Cairo (Telegrams Nos. 299, 300,302 and 303).    The Poreign Secretary and he had not yet had time to consider these telegrams and he therefore thought that consideration of the draft White Paper andthe amendments propos ed thereto might  be post-poned until the next meeting of the Cabinet.    He hoped,however that his colleagues would be prepared to reach a decision on the issues of principle raised by theMinister of Health.At the previous meeting of the Cabinet he hadsummarised the main arguments for and against an early announcement of our policy, and he need not repeat thosearguments.In paragraph 4 of his Memorandum,the Minister ofHealth said that it had become clear that the Moslemworld was much more influenced by evidence of strengthand vigour than by anything else.    He (the colonial secretary) agreed generally with this view, but he felt sure that a decision to postpone an announcement of our policy would be regarded as a sign of weakness.   Whenthe recent London Conference had been summoned, we had announced that if no agreement were readied, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would undertake the duty of deciding themselveswhat the policy in regard to Palestine should be.    Afterthe Conference we had reaffirmed that view.
so the Colonial  Secretary said that the policy which,we had put forward at the London Conference had been apolicy which we regarded as providing a just and fairsolution as between Arabs and Jews.    To some small extentwe had modified that policy, but the differences were,he thought, slight.    He was clear that any further postponement would be regarded by the Arab world as showing that v/e were unable to settle the palestine problem, and that the results of postponement on publicopinion both here and in Palestine would be unfavourable.Further, the Arabs would become suspicious thatwe were proposing to modify our policy in favour of theJews,    The Colonial Secretary referred to previous occasions on which this had happened,    Por example, in1955 certain proposals for establishing a LegislativeCoimcil had been announced.    These proposals had beennot unacceptable to the Arabs,    The Jews, however, had started an agitation against these proposals, which hadbeen rejected by the House of Commons,   He was, therefore,afraid that any postponement would not merely be regardedas weakness on our part, but would also give rise to the suspicion that Jewish influence was at work to get us tomodify our policy.It was true that the Arab opinion was nowsomewhat more favourable to us as a result of theoccupation of Albania by Italy, but he was afraid that unless we acted quickly, we should lose the benefit ofthat advantage.
As regards the policy itself, he had admittedfrankly that certain points had been insertedto meet Arab pressure and which, perhaps, wouldhave been omitted if the matter were looked aton strict merits.     He thought, however, that hehad somewhat over emphasised this aspect ofthe matter.The Colonial Secretary referred to thethree points on which the presentatives of the neighbouring Arab States had asked for further concessions.The first point was that, in paragraph10 (4) of the draft White Paper a statement had originally been included to the effect thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government anticipated that the palestinian representatives could be placed incharge of certain Departments within two years ofthe restoration of peace and order.     The present proposal was to agree that in certain cases thisshould be done at once     These Palestinianswould, of course, be working with British advisers and&apos;would be under the High Commissioner.     he did not think that this concession amounted tovery much.The second point was whether a reference should be made in the White Paper to a possiblefederal solution.     We had agreed to omit this reference on the clear understanding that we proposed to make a reference in the House of Commons
to a federal solution, as a possible solutionof the problem.     This was well understood bythe Prime Minister of Egypt and by therepresentatives of the other neighbouring arab states.     He regarded this change as an advantage,since any reference to the federal solution inthe White paper would be likely at the present stage to arouse prejudice against it.This third point was that the representativesof the neighbouring Arab States had pressed us tosay that an independent Palestine State should come into existence after 10 yearse     We had refused to agree to this, and had adhered to theview that circumstances might make thisimpracticableo     We had settled a formula in regardto consultation in this event,While he agreed that there were strong arguments which could be brought against theproposed statement of policy, more particularly fromthe Jewish point of view, there was also a very strong case indeed in favour of our proposed policy.       He was satisfied that support would beobtained for that policy, in the/ge&amp;tm&amp;p and alsoin the press both here and in the United States.
&quot; She Secretary of State for the Colonies hoped thatthe Cabinet would agree to an announcement without further postponement.      He agreed, however, that the parliamentary situation probably necessitated some alteration in thetime-table and it might not be desirable to make anannouncement of policy until the Military Training bill had passed through its early stages.     He hoped, however,that it might be possible to announce our policy on tuesday 9th or Wednesday 10th May.As regards the Mufti, he agreed that a statement should be made to the effect that the Mufti should beindefinitely excluded from Palestine.      This view wasshared by the High Commissioner and by General Haining, andthe Colonial Office took the view that the Mufti&apos;s returnwould make government impossible and would preventreconciliation in Palestine.The effect of such an announcement in regard to the mufti would be unfavourable to us in Egypt,      On the otherhand, representatives of Saudi Arabia and Trans Jordan were hostile to the Muftio      The announcement of the exclusion of the Mufti from Palestine might mean that we should not obtain the hoped-for declaration from the neighbouring arab States, but this declaration was, in any, case, soitw-what doubtful now,    ,He thought it was doubt fu.l, moreover, te^importance/should be attached to this declaration.The representatives of the neighbouring Arab States had agreed tacitly to our revised proposals.    , The effect of,their doing so publicly jaa4rfgl %&quot;4a^4&quot;^^...............other ^were already signs that our proposals were generally regarded as going a long way to meet the Arabs, and thatthe Rebellion in Palestine was coming to an end.
TEE SECRET. RY OF STATE TOR- FOREIGN affairs thought that the Colonial Secretary might legitimatelytake a somewhat more optimistic view of the situation.As he read the recent telegrams from Egypt, they represented an attempt to try and obtain rather better terms by bargaining, together with a desire to secure some little further advantage as part of the process of clearing up outstanding points.     He thought, however,that the Arab representatives were animated by a strong desire to reach a settlement, and would not insist upon their new suggestions.     He thought, too, that it hadbeen remarkable that the Arabs had not insisted onautomatic self-government after ten years.      He agreedthat the Mufti should be kept out of Palestine, but saidthat he attached importance to the form of words in whichthe announcement was made, and asked that his Departmentmight be consulted on this point.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR T7T3 COLONIES agreed.In speaking of the Mufti being excluded indefinitelyfrom Palestine, he had not suggested that these should/beAthe actual words to be used.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH pointed out that we were now dealing with proposals put forward as the resultof discussions in Cairo which went somewhat further than had been agreed upon in London.     What was more,the Arabs had got the impression that we were preparedto go still further.     He referred to the statements in regard to the negotiations in Cairo which had been published in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;.     notwithstanding that a strong telegram had been despatched to Sir miles lampson as to the leakage which had occurred, furtherstatements purporting to report the course of the informal negotiations had been published.     He thought- 7 -
-our main clanger was that we should make concessions from weakness and not from strengths      Further, hethought that the policy on which we were embarking wasone which could not be carried through to a successful conclusion.      It was proposed to put Palestinians incharge of certain Departments,     This would be asdifficult as putting South Irishmen in charge of NorthIrishmen, and would not work.      He thought that we were now departing from the policy which the Secretary ofState for the Colonies had himself outlined on the18th January, namely,, that we should work for an eventual return to some form of federal ism in Palestine,The attempt to carry out a unitary policy in palestine would, he felt sure, prove unworkable in practice, anda solution could only be found on federal lines.      Thematter could not be dealt with by a policy of one-sidedconcessions to.the Arabs.     He therefore asked theCabinet to consider the whole matter very carefullybefore our policy was announced.THE SECRETARY OF STATE TOR INDIA said that adecision on this matter would have considerable effect on the Moslem world, and he hoped that anannouncement would be made as early as possible.Moslem opinion had been much shocked by the Italianoccupation of Albanian     The present was the psycholo-psychological  moment for getting Moslem opinion on our side.The present position was embarrassing to us in many ways.Recently the Legislative Assembly in India had rejected the Anglo-Indian Trade Agreement, which had representedmany months of work.     They had taken this action,notwithstanding that most of the Moslem community werein favour of the Trade Agreement,  on the ground of. thelong delay in settling the Palestine question.
THE&quot;SECRETARY OF STATS FOE INDIA gave furtherinformation showing the suspicions of the Moslem worIdregarding our policsr, and concluded by emphasisingthat now was the right moment to take action whichwould restore the Moslems to their old allegiance,THE PRIME MINISTER said that the view advanced bythe Minister of Health went beyond asking that an announce-raent of our policy should be postponed.      In effect,he was asking that the policy itself should be reviewed.      The arguments adduced had been consideredby the Palestine Committee, who had reached theconclusion that we should proceed with our policy as outlined.     He thought that the changes made inthe proposals which had been submitted to the London .Conference were changes of expediency rather than ofprinciple, -    In any case there-would be grave difficultyin going back on our policy at the present time.Further,  even if we were to delay the announcement ofour policy, he saw no reason to suppose that theposition would be any easier to deal with in six months&apos;time.     He had seen Mr, Attlee and Mr, Greenwood that morning, who had asked that the announcement of our policy should be postponed.     He thought that they had urged this view on the ground that our hands were nowsomewhat freer and that we could reasonably contemplatesome delay.     He had told the Leaders of the labour opposition that their arguments would be fully consideredby the Cabinet, but that there were arguments on theother side.     He had, of course, expressed no view as to what the Cabinet conclusion would be.The Prime Minister said that his own conclusion was that there was nothing to be gained by
delaying for an indefinite period the announcementof our policy.     He did not, however, favour anannouncement in the next few days,,     He noted fromtelegram No. 299 from Sir Miles Lampson, that the PrimeMinister of Egypt did not expect an immediate announcement.Some postponement would also be helpful until some progress had been made with the Military Training Bill.Some discussion then ensued as to how long the postponement should be.THE SECRETARY OP STATS FOR THE COLONIES saidthat every day&apos;s delay made the situation more difficult and increased the likelihood that the representativesof the neighbouring Arab States would cease to be bound by the informal agreement which they had made.     At thesame time he agreed that a short postponement would notnecessarily have serious results.After further discussion, the Cabinet agreedthat the announcement of our policy should be deferred until after the Second Reading of the Military TrainingBill, and that the matter should then be further considered.rategical THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said that theonsiderations.Chief of the Imperial General Staff was in generalagreement with paragraphs 1 to 9 of the Minister ofHealth&apos;s Memorandum, but thought that the policy outlined in paragraph 10 of that Memorandum should be considerablymodified,     Further, as had already been mentioned at theCabinet, the General Staff strongly criticised the absence from the White Paper of a more specific statement as tothe strategical safeguards which we required.
THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINaTION OP DEFENCE saidthat the Chiefs of Staff took the view that the strategic requirements which we had in mind would constitute so extreme a requirement from an independent state that, unless we made clear the extent of thoserequirements now, we might have difficulties in obtainingsatisfaction when we came to negotiate a Treaty withPalestine.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES pointedshould he made to paragraph 10 (6) of the White Paper,to meet this point.It was agreed that further consideration shouldhe given to this point when the draft White Paper wasconsidered.agreement was expressed with the view that it would hedisastrous to attempt to revise our policy at the presenttime, and that our policy, while it was a compromise, wasabout as fair a settlement as was likely to be reached.The Cabinet agreed:(l)   That no change should be made in our general policy in regard to Palestine,as laid down in previous cabinet decisions:(2)   That the announcement of our policy inregard to Palestine should be deferred until after the Second Reading of theMilitary Training Bill, when the dateof the proposed announcement should befurther considered:(3)    To defer until the next Meeting of theCabinet consideration of the proposed amendments to the draft White Paper,including in particular the proposed amendments dealing with our strategicalre requirement s:(h)    That the Foreign Office should be consulted in regard to the terms of any proposed announcement as to the exclusion of the mufti from. Palestine.out that it hratHai^^g^be--d that some amendment in the course of further discussion, general
8.   &apos; The Cabinet hud before them a revised draftof the Reserve and Auxiliary Forces Bill (CP,-101(39)), submitted to the Cabinet on the instructions of a Ministerial Committee presided over by theLord Chancellor, together with an Explanatory Note.The Cabinet went through the draft Bill Clauseby Clause.     The main points dealt with in discussion were as followsPreamble and Clause 1 (l).It was agreed to adopt the revised wordingrecommended by the Ministerial Committee - &quot;urgently required for ensuring preparedness for the defenceof the realm against any external danger&quot;.Clause 2.     Reinstatement in Civil Employment.It was explained that this Clause had beendiscussed at the. Meeting of the ministerial committee held at 9.30 a.m.-. that morning, when ithad been decided to accept the Clause, subject tothe addition of words empowering the Minister ofLabour to make regulations to prevent evasion ofthe Clause.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR explained that he had had discussions on this matter with the confederation-tion of Employers, who were anxious that this matter should be dealt with on a voluntary basis.     Inorder to go some way to meet this view, it had beensuggested that the Clause should be re-drafted, soas to give the Minister of Labour power to make regulations on the lines set out in the draftClause.     The Ministerial Committee, however, hadnot favoured this suggestion.The Cabinet agreed to this Clause as drafted,subject to the addition proposed by the ministerial committee.
Clause 3*,   Simplification of Procedure for obtaining possession of landtaken under the Defence ..cts.THE PRIME MINISTER explained that he thoughtthat the reference to the Sheriff in Clause 3 (2)required amendment.There was some discussion whether it was desirable to retain the present procedure whereby acertificate has to be obtained from the lord lieutenant.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIE said that incertain cases delay was experienced in obtainingthese certificates;   but the view generally held ,(in which the Secretary of State for Air concurred)was that it was undesirable to attempt to modifythis part of the procedure.The Cabinet approved the Clause, subject tothe point on 3 (2)&apos; referred to above.Clause 6.     Duration of Act.The question was raised whether it wasnecessary that the duration of the Act should belimited to a period of three years, unless prolongedfrom year to year by affirmative Resolution.THE PRIME MINISTER reminded his colleagues that it had been felt that it was undesirable, asa permanent arrangement, to impose on Territorialsan obligation in excess of the contract which theyhad entered into. Further, the long title of theBill spoke of &quot;further and temporary provision...It was.agreed that the Clause should standas drafted.The Cabinet approved the presentation of the Reserve and Auxiliary Forces Bill,subject to the points raised in thediscussion above and to such further detailed amendments as might be foundnecessary.
idMILITARYTRAININGJJILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 23 (39)Conclusion 1.)3.     The Cabinet had before them a draft of theMilitary Training Bill (CP. 102 (39))? to whichwas annexed an Explanatory Note..Clause 1:    Men ordinarily resident in an overseasDominion^THE LORD CHANCELLOR explained that therehad been considerable discussion at the meeting heldat 9*30 a.m. that morning, on a point of considerabledifficulty which arose on the first Clause of theBill.      In brief, the point was that Parliament inthis country has no jurisdiction to legislate for persons ordinarily resident in the Dominions whohappen to be in this country.     The Lord Chancellorthought, therefore, that it was not right that theBill should use language which could be taken as implying that the persons ordinarily resident inthe Dominions were prima facie liable to the provisionof the Bill, but were exempted by provisoes in theBill.In the course of discussion, it was generally agreed that it would be desirable to amend the relevant passages in Clauses 1 and 2 of the Billon the lines indicated.     Thus, it was suggestedthat in Clause 1 (1) after the words &quot;every maleBritish subject&quot; in line 2, words on the lines ofthe following draft should be inserted:-&quot;not ordinarily resident in some part of H.M.Dominions outside the United Kingdom, in aBritish protectorate,  in a mandated territory,or in some other country or territory being a country or territory under H,M. protection orsuzerainty.&quot;with the result that the proviso to Clause 1 (l)would be deleted.     Clause 2 (l)(a) would also be deleted since the words in it would now be transferredto Clause 1 (l) and a provision on the follov/ing
/i&apos; h &quot;)x c wlines would be inserted in Clause 12:-&apos;&apos;The Minister shall by regulations make provision&apos; as to the registry of persons liable to be registered who are ordinarily resident outsidethe United Kingdom, and such regulations may, sofar as may be necessary, provide for postponing the obligations of persons registered inaccordance with the regulations, to a period after they have attained 21 years.&quot;Subject to further consideration of draftingpoints, this was agreed to.plication THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTERNorthernreland. explained that Clause 15 was necessary if only on theground that, while the Ministry of Labour would carryout the duties of registration in this country, thecorresponding Department in Northern Ireland was part ofthe Northern Ireland Government,     Some delay would benecessary in order to make the necessary modifications,and this delay could be used to consider how the matter should be dealt with, having regard to the attitude adopted by Mr. de Valera.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the problem could not be confined to Northern Ireland.       There wasalso the question of   Irishmen who were resident for thetime being in this country.     He thought that, on everyground, it was undesirable that a special provision shouldbe made to deal with this matter, since this &quot;would giverise to resentment in Northern Ireland.     He had therefore considered whether it would be possible to deal with thematter under powers of general application.     be referred to Clause 2 (l) (d) of the draft Bill whichexempted members of any Naval or Military or Air Forceraised by the Government of any part of His Majesty&apos;sDominions outside the United Kingdom.     This provision would be applicable to Eire as well as to the other
1G3Dominions.     He also referred to the power of postponement of calling up contained in Clause 1 (3)of the Bill.     He thought it might he indicated toMr. de Valera that Irish Nationalists living inNorthern Ireland or in this country, who wished to doso could join any suitable Eire force, and that thepower of postponement would be utilised to tide over aperiod until necessary arrangements to this end could he made.      It was to be hoped that Mr. de Valera might accept this proposal.     If he raised difficulty, we might have to consider the matter again.     A thirdalternative was that he might ask that specificprovisions to this effect should be made in the Bill.He would much prefer to avoid any specific provisionshut, if need be, the Government could consider insertingsuch a provision during the Committee Stage.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the planproposed, although no doubt open to certain objections,was the only way which he could see of avoiding a head-on collision.     It was impossible to ggantHre^baireseeffip:t4oi*^4&apos;e* Irish Rationalists resident in NorthernIreland.     To do so would result in the resignation of-Lord Craigavon and of the Northern Ireland Government.Although the solution proposed would not be veryacceptable to Lord Craigavon, the Home Secretary was satisfied that it wes not worth while involvingourselves in serious difficulties on account of the verysmall number of persons who would otherwise be subjectto the provisions of the scheme, in such districts as,for example, the Counties of Fermanagh and Tyrone.
THE CHANCELLOR OR THE EXCHEQUER very much doubtedv/hether Ivir. de Valera would accept the scheme suggested.THE PRIME MINISTER read out a message which had he en handed, to him from Mr, Dulanty to the effect thatthe Cardinal Archbishop of Armagh and the she Northern IrishDiocesans had just issued a solemn declaration that theapplication of conscription to Northern Ireland v/ouldhe disastrous and had invited the prayers of their people that this calamity might he averted,TIRD SECRETARY OP STATS FOR THE COLONIES said thathe thought that this matter was likely to give rise tovery considerable difficulties.      In effect, theproposal meant that the persons concerned would hecompelled either to undergo training in this  country or to join the armed forces of Eire,     He thought itv/ould be difficult for Mr. de Valera to support sucha scheme, and he asked v/hether it was not possible to-reach some compromise.     The effect on opinion abroadof the introduction of military training would, be considerably diminished if serious troubles resulted inNorthern Ireland,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thoughtthat Mr. de valera&apos;s attitude might be that he would setup defence forces as and when he wanted them, and notat our suggestion.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER concurred in thisview, and thought that Mr. de Valera would be likely tobe actuated by whatever attitude would, in his view,promote the unity of Ireland as a whole.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS said thatit would be impossible to take action which was tanta-mount to. admitting a right on Mr. de Valera*s part toveto the application of the Bill to Northern Ireland.
THE SECRETARY OP STATE PGR FOREIGN AFFAIRS suggestedthat&apos; the right course was to make provision in the Billenabling the provisions of the Bill to be applied to northern Ireland by Order in Councils     At the same time*it should be made clear that we wanted consultation andexamination of the difficulties, before any action wasdecided upon, and we should make clear that we did not wish to make difficulties about this matter.In this connection, it was pointed out that Clause 15of the Bill was drafted in discretionary terms - &quot;HisMajesty may by Order in Council direct that this Actshall extend to Northern Ireland&quot;.      This wording was perhaps not altogether consistent with Clause 1 of theBill, which definitely imposed certain obligations onall male British subjects in the United Kingdom.      Itwas agreed, however,  that,  in the circumstances,  it was better not to alter the wording of Clause 15 of the Bill*THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS pointedout that as regards Irishmen resident in this country,we could take the view that, either the3r must servetheir period of military training, or return to Ireland.The view generally taken was that while Mr. de valera might not accept the scheme outlined by the PrimeMinister, the best course was to open up discussions withhim on the lines suggested.The Cabinet agreed -(1) That Clause 15 of the Bill should stand as drafted:(2) That a communication should be sent to theHigh. Commissioner for Eire to the effectthat, before the Bill can be brought   intooperation in Northern Ireland, certain administrative, arrangements are necessary-It would take some time to make these arrangements, and no doubt in the meantimediscussion will take place between the interested parties:(3 ) That the Home Secretary should inviteLord Craigavon to come over to thiscountry for consultations-
1 y &amp;Clause 2.    Exemption of certain classes of persons.,THE HOME SECRETARY said that he had been strongly pressed to obtain statutory exemption under the Bill forpolicemen.      He understood that strong objection was felt to making specific statutory exemptions for policemen,but he wished it to be set on record that he understoodthat policemen would,  in point of fact, be exempted by administrative action.    The position of firemen was oloseDyanalogous to that of police.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE DUCHY OP LANCASTERemphasised the undesirability of starting to makestatutory exemptions for specific classes of persons.He thought that the matter was one which could properly be dealt with by administrative action.Clause 3*    Conscientious Objectors.The question was raised whether there was workof national importance upon which these persons could beemployed without giving rise to labour difficulties.      Itwas thought that this could be arranged.The possibility was mooted that the conscientiousObjector Clause might conceivably be used to exempt fromtraining Irish Nationalists in Northern Ireland.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR DOMINION affairs saidthat he did not altogether like the number of differentcategories into which conscientious objectors were to be divided. No doubt the change was a large one and wouldinvolve difficulties; but he asked whether it would notbe possible for all conscientious objectors to be formedinto Labour Corps and given physical training.It was generally felt that, while there was muchto commend this scheme,  it involved too great difficulties for adoption at the present time.
Clause 6.    Reinstatement in civil employment.This Clause was agreed to,  subject to theamendment made in the corresponding Clause (Clause 2)of the Reserve and Auxiliary Forces Bill (c.f.  Conclusion 2).Clause 7.    Simplification of procedure for obtainingpossession of land taken under the DefenceActs.This Clause was likewise agreed to, subject to thepoint raised in discussion of the corresponding Clause(Clause 3) of the Reserve and Auxiliary Forces Bill(c.f.  Conclusion 2).Clause 8.    Power to raise Royal Naval Special Reserve.In reply to questions,  THE FIRST LORD OF THEADMIRALTY explained that it was the intention that men inthe mercantile marine called up for six months&apos; training should be given Naval training, probably in anti-aircraftwork.      Similarly, fishermen called up would be given Navaltraining, probably in trawling against mines.Schedule.    Part II.    Local and Appellate Tribunals.Discussion took place whether the words in square brackets, which provided that certain members of thesetribunals should be appointed after consultations withorganisations representative of workers,  should beincluded.After discussion it was decided to leave these words out,  on the understanding that if the Labour Partyasked for their inclusion,  this should be agreed to.It was suggested that the Prime Minister might make some reference to this matter in his speech on Thursday,moving the Second Reading of the Bill.
THE LORD CHANCELLOR also referred to theproposal that the Chairman of the Appellate tribunal should be a Judge of the High Court or a Judge of theCourt of Sessions,  or a person who had held either ofthose offices.      He referred to the difficulty ofsparing a Judge of the High Court, and suggested that aperson with suitable qualifications for this administrative work could be found without appointing a High court judge,      He asked whether the Schedule could provide tha^the Chairman should be appointedby the Lord Chancellor^ &quot;&apos;It was agreed that this matter should be;further considered.The Cabinet agreed:- &apos;&apos;To approve the presentation of theMilitary Training Bill,  subject tothe points raised above, and to such further detailed drafting amendments as might be found necessary.In this connection it was agreed thata further Meeting of the ministerial committee, under the chairmanship of the Lord Chancellor, should be heldat 3 p.m,  the same afternoon.
IJTARY 4. The Cabinet had before them a Draft FinancialFINING BILL-.    I^Uj^^&amp;^U*^. C? ,0-/02. -A  **J)a g^s^klaati&amp;ar/to accompany the Military Training Bill.AFT FINANCIAL Aft^^JQSt. - THE PRIME MINISTER directed the Cabinet&apos;attention to Paragraph 16, which contained a statement1 that &quot;during the initial period of continuous militarytraining the men will be clothed, fed and accommodatedfrom military sources and will receive pay at the rateof 1/- a day&quot;.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that hewas very anxious that persons enlisted under theMilitary Training scheme should be regarded as citizensoldiers.     Im was important that the scheme should begiven a good send-off.     He thought that the proposal that the persons enlisted under the Scheme should receive a different rate of pay from that of Regular soldiersinvolved making a distinction, and to some extent castinga slur on persons compulsorily enlisted under the new scheme.     He realised that the proposal that these men should receive the same rate of pay as the Regulars andTerritorials would involve considerable additionalexpense, but he was very anxious to see equalityestablished between those enlisted under the Scheme for compulsory military training and other persons in theDefence Forces.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR pointed out that atthe present time marriage allowanees were paid to Regularsoldiers, sailors and airmen at the age of 26, but it has nowbeen agreed to reduce this age to 23.      It was proposedthat persons compulsorily enlisted should receiveallowances during their period of continuous militarytraining in respect of their dependants, irrespective of
age.     The adoption of the Secretary of State forAir&apos;s proposal would thus mean that a Regular soldierof, say, 22, who was married, would he worse off thana conscript of 20 or 21.     Such a position could not he justified.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that there were grounds for treating persons enlisted under theMilitary Training Bill differently during the sixmonths of continuous training, from persons who hadtaken up a career in the Regular Army of their ownfree will.     He thought, however, that during the subsequent 3-g- years&apos;  service in the Reserve orTerritorial Forces the persons enlisted under theMilitary Training Bill should receive the same rateof pay as other members of those Forces.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER deprecatedthe suggestion that a settlement which had recentlybeen reached with regard to the reduction of the age at which marriage allowances were payable in the Regular forces should now be reopened. There was surely a great differencebetween persons who entered the Service of theirownfree will and persons who were compulsorilyenlisted.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that itwas necessary to make provision for dependants ofpersons compulsorily enlisted, and this involved thegrant of marriage allowances at the age of 20 or 31.It was this new fact which made it necessary to reconsider the age on which marriage allowances were paid to the wives of Regular soldiers, sailors and airmen.He thought that it was impossible to maintain a distinction in this matter.
&quot;/La^ir  /x**v*w  t^w &quot;/Lc  &amp;quJ-A4. P-zycLi-&amp;   &amp;6-c*j6.cL at^O-THE FIRST LORD OR THE ADMIRALTY agreed^4fe*Jfc^laier vioiWyuqltlie^t^-^ea^-mie^arte1 he thought that payment of a marriage allowance at 23 was a betterarrangement than payment of this allowance at theage of 20. HiTHE SECRETARY OR STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSfelt the difficulty of making a distinctionbetween men enlisted under the Military TrainingBill and other members of the Defence Forces.   he asked whether an announcement could not be made that marriage allowances would be paid todependants of persons enlisted under the provisionsOf the Act and who were now married, but that thepersons who married hereafter and were enlistedunder the Act would not receive marriage allowances.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said thatthe Bill was likely to be attacked by the LabourParty on the grounds that the scale of pay and allowances provided for the men called up under theBill were inadequate.   He thought it was clearlynecessary to pay marriage allowances to wives ofpersons enlisted under the Bill, and he was satisfied that it would be impossible to maintain a distinction, in regard to the age at whichmarriage allowances were payable, between personsenlisted under the Bill and those in. the RegularDefence Forces.    The cost of this concessionamounted to some  200^000 per year.   Provided this concession was made, he thought that it was possibleto defend the payment through six months&apos; contin-uous service of pay at the rate of l/- a day.To raise the rate to 2/- a day would cost  1,800,000a year.
In the course of further discussion, theCHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER pointed out that therewas also the consideration that men enlisted underthe scheme were liable for Home service only,whereas Regular Soldiers were liable to be sentto any part of the world.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that,while he agreed that a case could be made for maintaining the differential rate of pay, he would prefer to ensure a good start for the scheme byabolishing any differential rate of payment.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought thatit was undesirable that the Cabinet should attemptto reach a decision on this difficult matter at such short notice.    It must be remembered thatif a decision was reached to make payment at ahigher rate, we should be imposing charges whichwould endure for some years.The Prime Minister therefore proposed, andthe Cabinet agreed:-(l)   That the words &quot;at the rate of1/- a day&quot; should be deleted fromthe first sentence of paragraph 16of the Financial Memorandum whichit was proposed should be published that evening with the MilitaryTraining Bill.(2)   That the matter should be reservedfor further consideration beforethe Second Reading of the Billtook place on Thursday, the 4thMay.
