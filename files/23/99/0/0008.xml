i.THE PRIME MINISTER sald that, as hiscolleagues were aware, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs was attending the Council of theLeague at Geneva*     Certain other members of theCabinet had also been unavoidably prevented from attending the present meeting of theCabinetoHe was sure that all his colleagues would wish to give the Lord President of the council a warm welcome on his return from his voyage.
BRITISH AIRTRANSPORTbill.(previous references:Cabinet 54(38), con-conclusion 8,anfl Cabinet58 (38), Con-elusion 8.)2.        The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Air ( CP.-117 (39))  cover-ing a draft British Air Transport Bill.   The objectof the Bill, which was a hybrid measure, was to providefor the establishment and constitution of a public corporation to acquire and. operate the undertakings of Imperial Airvays, Limited, and British Airways .Agreement had been reached with the Boards of bothCompanies as to the price to be paid for the respectiveundertakings, details of which he had already announced in the House of Commons on the 12th May.    Afteroutlining the financial implications of the Dill* theSecretary of State added that it was essential thatthe Bill should become law before the end of theSess ion,The Cabinet also had before them the following recommendation to the Cabinet by the Committee ofHome Affairs, who had considered an earlier draft ofthe Bill (H./.C 11th Conclusions (39), Minute 1):-To approve the British Air transport bill in the form of the revised draftas settled by the Secretary of State&quot;f^or Air in consultation with the LordChancellor, the Attorney-General and parliamentary Counsel, an^ to authorisethe introduction in the House of commons of the Bill in the form as so approved,subject to any drafting or other minor amendments that may be found necessary or desirable.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that anumber of amendments had been made in the Bill, on therecommendation of the Home Affairs Committee, aiming at simplification.    He thought that the Home AffairsCommittee were now satisfied with the Bill as altered.In reply to a question by the Minister of Labour, he agreed that a further drafting amendment was requiredto deal with the question of wages.
In reply to a further question, the Secretary of -State for Air said that he was satisfied that the price tohe paid for the two undertakings could he justified.    Thenegotiations had been carried out by the Treasury with,he thought, considerable skill, and in his opinion the price which it had been agreed should be paid was fair and reasonable.    At the meeting of the shareholders ofImperial Airways on the previous day a number of the shareholders had been by no means satisfied with the price to be received from the Exchequer.The Secretary of State for Air referred to clause 27 of the Bill, which provided that the aggregateamount of grants payable under the Act, when added tothe aggregate amount of subsidies paid under agreementsmade before the commencement of the Act, should notexceed a specified limit.      The amount of this limithad been left blank.    He proposed that this limit ?should be  4 millions annually, which was  1 million in excess of the present limit on subsidies for air transport.This was agreed to.The Cabinet -Approved the British Air Transport Billin the form of the revised draft attachedto CP.  117(39) with the furtheralterations mentioned in the discussion,and authorised its introduction in theHouse of Commons, subject to any drafting or minor amendments that maybe found necessary.
CONTROL OP 3.     The Cabinet had before them a Most SecretEXPENDITURE.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(Previous       (CP.-118 (39)) entitled &quot;Control of Expenditure&quot;.Reference:Oabinet 22   The continuous flow of demands reaching the Treasury(39)3 Con-clusion 3.) from all quarters for approval to schemes involvingP/?.33^3^)^   heavy expenditure3 made it necessary for him to draw(h &quot;?)-&quot; 3&amp; (iq)2     attention to the seriousness of the situation and toask his colleagues to help to provide a remedy for it.The success which had been met with, hitherto in findingall the money required for defence purposes providedno assurance for the future, in view of the tremendousacceleration in expenditure.     Although we appeared tobe going on as comfortably as if we were paying our way,we were really reducing our resources at a rapid rate,and getting closer to the position, where the consequences would become alarmingly evident.      After outlining thepresent borrowing programme and referring to theadditional expenditure involved by. the doubling of theTerritorial Army3 conscription^ Air Force expansion^ andother defence schemes9 the Chancellor emphasised thatthere was a limit to the rate at which we could raisemoney9 and that that limit9  to the best of his judgmenthad already been reached.      He did not wish in any wayto slow up our programmess buts for the reasons advanced in his Memorandum9 it was clear that from now onwards wemust be more conservative in our expenditure.     National
safety must, of course, still dominate all other considerations, but our Defence schemes were well advanced., and it was therefore possible now to takeother factors into consideration.     Even in regard to defence proposals it should be possible to settlesome order of priority.      It was a question of deciding whether it was essential to expand particular activities and whether, in consequence, we should have to goslower in developing other activities.     What was needed, therefore, was some method for surveying new proposals in the light of the general financial situation.      The Chancellor of the Exchequer accordingly suggested that three or four members of the cabinet should be nominated who would be available, at his request, for the purpose of examining with him, moreparticularly from the expenditure point of view, freshproposals that might come forward involving substantialoutlay which appeared to require such examination.     Theobject of the examination would be to deal with the matter in broad   outline, and would not dispense with the needfor the present methods of detailed control when thegeneral authority had been given by the Treasury.     Heused the word &quot;expenditure&quot; in its widest sense, ascovering expenditure out of Votes, or out of Governmentborrowings, or capital expenditure by other authorities or persons, induced by Government subsidies or grants.
THE CHANCELLOR OR THE EXCHEQUER said that nosound judge would put the annual savings of the country at a figure much in excess of  450 millions.     normally,of course, that sum was used by civil requirements for building, engineering, and so forth.     There was no action which the Government could take which would increase the total volume of savings of the country asa whole.     It was argued by ivjr. Haynard Keynes andqer^ain other persons that expenditure created sayings,and that provided we were prepared to spend money on alarge scale, that would automatically create the savingsnecessary to finance the expenditure.     There was, of,course, an element of truth in this theory inasmuch asif heavy expenditure increased pz^osperity, that in turntended to increase the yield of taxation and national savings.     But the fact remained that, although theprofits which woula result from increased expenditure would be of assistance if we were now to go in for alarge programme of expenditure financed by borrowing,we should, when the programme came to an end, be worse off and not better off.It was with the knowledge that the annual savings of the country were in the neighbourhood of  450 millionsthat the decision had been taken,  at the time when theDefence Loan Bill was being passed through Parliament,that the Treasury could take the risk of borrowing 350 millions in the current financial year.      It was,of course, never thought that the whole of this sumcould be met by long-term borrowing:   much of itwould have to be met by Treasury Bills.The Chancellor said that since this figure of 350 millions had. been announced the total sum to beborrowed in the current year had increased.     Thus,
in his Budget Speech he had spoken of an expenditure of 380 millions in the current financial year to he met from borrowing.      There was no doubt that this figure had increased still further and was probably now inthe neighbourhood of  400 millions.It may be possible to meet this vast expenditure from borrowing in the current financial year for aspecial reason.      Owing to the drain of gold from thiscountry    in the past 12 months it has been possibleto pay off Treasury Bills with the sterling receivedfrom the sale of the gold.     The total volume of treasury Bills outstanding in the hands of themarket was now about  150 millions loss to-daythan the usual figure0 It was intended tomeet a large part of the borrowing incurred in thecurrent year by increasing the volume of Treasury Bills.But this process could not be repeated in the ensuingyear.The Chancellor saia that he thought it would be agreat help to him if two or three of his colleaguescould meet together at intervals and discuss theposition with him.     as statec in his Paper&apos;, his own responsibility was inescapable.     Nevertheless, he feltthat at the present time our arrangements for discussionof financial problems were not altogether satisfactory.Discussions took place between the Chancellor of theExchequer and the particular Minister responsiblefor the proposed expenditure, and there was no arrange-ment by which some of his colleagues could obtain abird&apos;s-eye-view of the whole position.      He would propose to make a start by arranging for the ministers concerned, who would be chosen by the Prime Minister,to meet the chief officials of the Treasury.
The Chancellor said that he was sure hiscolleagues would agree that the Treasury had not inany way opposed the re-armaraent programme.     There wasgrave danger, however, that in six or twelve monthswe might find ourselves in a very serious situation.The next year looked like being a year of the greatest difficulty, and he thought that he was entitled tothe help of a number of his colleagues in examining the position as a whole.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR AIR referred to theexisting procedure for approval of expenditure.     his experience was that, in addition to consideration bya number of Committees, all projects of expenditure were very carefully examined by the Treasxiry and were subject to a number of checks.     He hoped that theexisting procedure would not be made more cumbrous.He enquired whether it would be possible for every member of the Cabinet to be given an appreciation ofthe financial position.     With the exception of thereports made a year ago by the present Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs, he thought that theCabinet, as a whole, had never had a balanced state-ment of the financial position as it affected defence.He hoped that the Treasury would also be in aposition to give an appreciation of the financialposition in Germany, where for a number of years theexpenditure on defence had been far greater than inthis country.      In this way, all members of theCabinet would be able to share responsibility for thedecisions reached.
Continuing, the Secretary of State said thatany sign of hesitation at the present time would, inhis view, be disastrous, and he thought that theright course was to incur expenditure on defence evenabove the scale which might be dictated by a carefulfinancial estimate.     He was glad to note that theChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s suggestion related onlyto new proposals.THE SECRETARY OE STATE FOR WAR said that he was unwilling to oppose any scheme which might be ofassistance to the Chancellor of the Exchequer havingregard to the helpful attitude which the Chancelloralways adopted.     Nevertheless, he felt some difficultyin regard to the present proposal.     He thought therewas perhaps some difference between the proposal asset out in the Memorandum before the Cabinet and asdeveloped by the Chancellor that morning.     be referred to the existing procedure for dealing with proposals involving expenditure:    the principle ofany large proposals had to be approved by the Cabinet,often after lengthy examination by the Committee ofImperial Defence or by Sub-Committees of the Committeeof Imperial Defence.     Even when the proposals hadbeen approved in principle, the Minister responsiblefor carrying them out had to justify all the detailsof expenditure to the Treasury Inter-services committee.      The same officials were concerned, indealing with all these questions, and he feared that,if another Committee was set up^ the result would beto throw an increasing burden on the officials concerned.
THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY supported the view that it was undesirable to add anotherCommittee to those already in existence.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER explainedthat it was not his intention to add to themachinery for checking the expenditure of theDefence Departments.    He felt, however, that solohg as proposals for expenditure (whether on defence, by way of loans to foreign countries, oron Social Services) were dealt with in isolation,the Cabinet were not obtaining the comprehensivefinancial survey which was required..    It was hisaim that all his colleagues should be able to see what was involved in these requests, and whatthe results would be if we spent more than wecould afford.    It was important to realise that the traditional checks on expenditure, which existedso long as expenditure was met from revenue, nolonger operated.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF defence said that, at the time when the chancellors Memor-andum had been circulated, he had himself beenpreparing a Memorandum, drawing attention to thelarge number of outstanding claims, and expressing the view that it would be desirable for thesematters to be dealt with together and not piece-meal.   He drew attention to the somewhatdisturbing position in regard to our financial situation which had been mentioned by theTreasury representative at the fourth Meeting ofthe Strategical Appreciation Sub-Committee ofthe   Committee of Imperial Defence.    The Canmitfcee hai
then been told that our staying power in warcould no longer he relied upon, and that weshould start the war in a far less favourable position than in 1914 from the financial pointof view.   In the Minister1s view, there were three aspects of the matter which must be takeninto consideration:    first, the money which was available for immediate expenditure;    secondly,the financial reserves which we should use tomaintain ourselves in war, and, thirdly, theindustrial capacity with which we maintained our financial reserves.    What we really required wasa picture which would show us how much we couldspend after balancing all these three factors.Our present defence expenditure was far higherthan the rate which, we had been informed about a year ago, represented the maximum thatwe could safely afford.    He, for his part,hoped that it would be possible to provide information which would enable him and hiscolleagues on the Committee of Imperial defence to know whether or not an additional expenditureof say,  30 millions represented, in presentcircumstances, an intolerable burden on theExchequer.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR HOME affairs thought it would be helpful if the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer could arrange for a survey on thelines suggested to be made available to the wholeCabinet.    He was somewhat apprehensive ofestablishing a body which would operate as afurther check at the present juncture^*w^/Vj A64Ctft
THE PRIME MINISTER said that theChancellor of the Exchequer had mentionedthis matter to him some time ago, and he had felt that the Cabinet should agree to aproposal that the Chancellor should have somehelp from his colleagues in dealing with amore difficult situation than any of hispredecessors had had to face    There was one aspect of the matter, as he had visualised itwhen the Chancellor had discussed it with him,which perhaps had not been fully brought out, viit was a disadvantage in the present system,that when the Chancellor put financial problems before the Cabinet there was hardlyanyone who was in a position to consider these problems against a background of financialknowledge.    It was clear that it was impossiblefor the Government to continue the present rate of expenditure indefinitely0    Sooner or later some extraordinary measure would have tobe taken.    Even if the international situation were to clear up in the next few months and ameasure of disarmament should take place   weshould still be faced with a position wherebyit would be impossible to meet our annual expenditure from taxation.    He thought it wouldbe a great help to the Chancellor of theExchequer, and of benefit to the Cabinet as awhole, if a certain number of Cabinet ministers were to be associated with the Chancellor of theExchequer and were thus placed in a position - 1
to approach these problems with more informationthan was available to most of them at thepresent time.    It was clear that the issues werenot only concerned with defence expenditure.Civil expenditure and the cost of social services must also be brought into account.   Atime might arise when the Government would haveto consider whether expenditure, even on social services, could be continued at the present level.The Prime Minister said that he would liketo propose that the Ministers to be associated,with the Chancellor should not have every new proposal of expenditure submitted to them, butthat they should inform themselves in regard tothe position generally, so that when financial matters, came before the Cabinet there would beat least six members who would be informed of theposition.Referring to the discussion at the strategical Appreciation Committee of the Committeeof Imperial Defence in regard to our financialposition, the Prime Minister said that hethought the best plan would be to proceedwith the arrangement proposed by theChancellor, and for the Ministers concerned to decide ton the form of the document tobe circulated to the Cabinet as a whole.rs
In the discussion   hich ensued THEMINISTER OP LABOUR thought that the Committeewould have to take into account economic   aswell as financial matters.       He referredto the two systems of finance which were operating concurrently in Germany - the internal and the external system.       The problems inthis country were, however, quite difference.So far no serious difficulties had arisen inregard to wages since the re-armameentprogramme started.       Up till now it had beenfound possible to lift the level of wages tomeet any increase in prices.       On the lastoccasion   when trouble had threatened thedifficulty had been solved by the increase in wages &quot;which had been granted by the engineeringemployers, but this increase had only beengranted after considerable pressure had been applied to them.       A part of the difficultyarose from the fact that while the sectionof the engineering industry engaged on there-armament programme was doing well, therest of the industry was for the most partdoing badly.       The Minister added that, fromthe labour point of view, he would be subjected to pressure on the related issues ofprices and wages and profits.       He hoped thatthe Ministers concerned would pay regard tothese aspects pf the problem. u*u*3- lh -
THE MINISTER OP HEALTH thought that the surveyto he undertaken would he a difficult matter in anumber of ways.     He hoped that the Ministers concerned would take into account, not merely our obviousdisadvantages, as compared with the position in 1914,hut also those factors, not always easy to assess, Inwhich we were better off than in 1914*THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR referred to theimportance of the Cabinet having a picture of our financial position in order that we might know whether wewere able to face the prospect of a long war, and might make our plans accordingly.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO said that while no doubt we were largely without the foreign exchange resources which we had possessed in 1914, it was fair to remember that on this occasion we had provided for anumber of needs in advance of the outbreak of war.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND assumed thatthe arrangement whereby a number of Ministers were tobe associated with the Chancellor of the Exchequer wouldbe kept secret, having regard to the possible effect on public opinion if it were represented that we were takingcertain action because we were uneasy as to our financialposition.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the existence of thisarrangement like the terms of reference and membership of other Cabinet Committees, would have to be kept secret.This would be in accordance with the normal procedure.
THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL thought it ofthe utmost importance to ascertain how long we could continue to spend money at the present rate without our position deteriorating, and what form the deterioration of our position would be likely to take.He also thought that the methods which Germany had adopted should be seriously studied.THE PRIME MINISTER invited the following membersof the Cabinet to be associated with the Chancellorof the Exchequer for the purposes indicated in theChancellor of the Exchequers Memorandum:-The Lord President of the Council.The Lord Chancellor.The Secretary of State for Home Affairs.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.The President of the Board of Trade.The Cabinet agreed:-That the Lord President of the council the Lord chancellor the Secretary of State for Home Affairsthe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairsthe Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster the President of the Board of trade should be associated with the Chancellor of theExchequer in an examination of our economicand financial position, sen&amp; should be athis disposal from time to time to consider the bearing of the position upon proposals for  ,public expenditure. ^pk^^ei   ^jsi&amp;r h^*^/Xt this point the Secretary of Statefor Air left the meeting^7
LIMITATION   4. The Cabinet had vder consideration a MostOF ARMAMENTPROFITS.       Secret Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(C. P.-122 (39)),  in which he recommended for the(previous reference:    approval of his colleagues a scheme of taxation to beCabinet 23(39), Con- imposed on the excess profits of firms mainly engagedelusion 3. )on the re-armament programme, with a view to implementing the undertaking given by the Prime Minister on the 26thApril that further steps to that end would be taken.Briefly stated,  the proposals outlined in the scheme were as follows.       A standard definition v/ould be found for&quot;armaments&quot;, and thus for &quot;firms mainly engaged onre-armament work&quot;.        To the profits of the firms thusdefined he proposed to apply a new duty (which might be described as the &quot;Armaments Profits Duty&quot; or &quot;A.P.D. &quot;)in respect of the excess above a permitted maximum.When that excess profit had been ascertained,  it wouldbe necessary to divide it between the armament and thenon-armament work, since it was only the part applicableto armament work which should be specially taxed.      Theamount of tax proposed by the Chancellor was 50 or 60per cent.      It might well be that the scheme would not produce any substantial sum of money;    indeed, the more successful the Contracts Departments were in their efforts to prevent contractors from making high profits,the smaller should be the yield.       The Chancellor addedthat if his proposals were approved in principle bythe Cabinet, and if the consideration of the actual form of those proposals was sufficiently advanced,  itwould be possible to make a statement in general termson the Second Reading of the Finance Bill, which was due to take place on Thursday,  the 25th May.
In the course of a brief exposition of the main points in his Memorandum, the CHANCELLOR OF THEEXCHEQUER said that he was opposed to any scheme whereby the whole of the excess profits would be taken by theExchequer.      He thought that such a scheme would bemanifestly wrong, since it was only right that acontractor who did his work quickly and efficiently, and thereby earned a large profit, should receive bettertreatment than a contractor who carried out his workslowly and less efficiently.      In the later stages of thelast war, Excess Profits Duty had been levied at therate of 80%, and it had become evident that duty at this rate put a premium on the loose and extravagant conductof business.     He proposed, therefore, that the tax onexcess profits should be at the rate of 50-60$.The Chancellor added that he was not enamoured ofthe particular scheme proposed, and did not expect thatIt would result in any large accretion of revenue.It was essential, however, to carry out the undertaking which the Prime Minister had given with Cabinet approval and he thought that the scheme proposed was the best available.     He added that he did not propose to make public any estimate of the sum expected to be receivedfrom this duty.     He had shown the scheme in confidence to Lord Plender.     Lord Plender had made certaindetailed suggestions, but had thought that the schemewas satisfactory and would work.THE LORD CHANCELLOR thought it would bedesirable to consult a number of members of the accouting profession in confidence in regard to that part of the scheme which was set out at the top of page3 of the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s Memorandum.
The sort of point which he had in mind was that manyfirms making large excess profits would be doing so in factories which they had specially erected for the-purposes of the re-armament programme, and which wouldbecome useless when that programme came to an end.     Itwas necessary to ensure that the scheme dealt adequatelywith this type of case.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION affairs referred to industries such as optical glass and machine tools, in which extreme fluctuations in trade occurred.The initiation of the re-armament programme had been seriously hampered by the fact that a number of niachine-tool makers had gone out of business,  and that it hadbeen necessary to take steps to get their works re-started.A number of firms had survived only as a result of havingaccumulated large profits during the war years, whichthey had drawn on to maintain themselves during the slump.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that thescheme set out in the second paragraph on page 3 wasinserted to meet this type of case.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs thought there might be some danger of this tax operatingso as to slow down the re-armament programme, since firmswould tend to prefer commercial work, on the grounds that it was more profitable.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR said that the industrial relations Branch of the Ministry were somewhat perturbed-at the statement in the first sentence of paragraph 5 thatthe Minister without Portfolio was satisfied that no plancould be devised which in the case of future armamentscontracts would secure that the profits could not be above asuitable limits     He hoped that no piVblie announcement
would be made to this effect.      The matter was one onwhich there was strong feeling in the Trade Unioncircles and it might be necessary at a later stage to approach the matter from the point of view that itwas essential to revise the form of contract in sucha way as would effectively limit prices and profits.THE MINISTER WITHOUT PORTFOLIO wtid Lliul UlliSteers Hai&apos;!y of Qtato to-^y-g hafl wgt T/with a coMtpimfroge^ttoa-l&apos;......in&quot; -hits.....attempt-&apos; to1 &quot;smury*&quot;the*&quot;M o^in4K)^k-;-AgKPQ orao nt.- La thought that with fctei-s experience^ in front of him in regard to contracts for air frames and air engines,he would be very rash to assume that it would bepossible to devise a form of contract which would effectively limit profits in the varied field coveredby contracts for army supply.The Minister added that he was apprehensivelest the imposition of this tax should hold up supply.There was of course a power in the draft Ministry ofSupply Bill to compel manufacturers to accept orders.The question of identifying the firms which were engaged in re-armament work would be a somewhatdifficult and invidious one.     Pending the passing into law of the Ministry of Supply Bill,  this task woulddevolve on the three Defence Departments.In reply to a question, from the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs, the CHANCELLOR OF THEEXCHEQUER said that the scheme as devised would applyto sub-contractors.THE PRIME MINISTER said that if it was possible,to devise a  scheme  v/hich would prevent contractorsfrom earning Excessive profits,&quot; the result might wellbe that no-one would be willing to undertake Government
contracts.      The difficulty was not wholly solved by the conferring on Ministers of compulsory powers,since these powers would not enable the Governmentto get work done quickly and effectively.     Thearrangement now proposed was put forward largely inorder to meet the objection felt in Trade Union circlesto any conscription of labour without some correspondingconscription of wealth.      The proposal had the furtheradvantage that it applied a corrective to any errorswhich might occur under the present contract methodsin price fixing.The Prime Minister thought however that it wouldbe very desirable that the matter should be discussed with the Trade Union Leaders before an announcement wasmade, and he invited the Chancellor of the exchequer to consult with the Minister of Labour as to how suchconsultations could best take place.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER referring to the concluding paragraph of his Memorandum said that itwas not his intention to volunteer a statement on thismatter in the second reeding debate on the Finance Billon Thursday Hay 25th.      He wished, however, to be in aposition, if challenged on that day to make anannouncement in general terms.     No clause had. yet been drafted to give effect to the arrangements proposed.The Cabinet agreed -(1) To authorise the Chancellor of theExchequer to make a statement in very general terms on the secondreading of the Finance Bill onThursday, 25th May, on the lines set out in his Memorandum CP. 122 (39),if this should prove necessary.
To authorise the Chancellor of theExchequer in consultation with theMinister of Labour to consult with trade Union Leaders in regard tothe proposals set out in his memorandum, if possible   before any public announcement is made.
PALESTINE. 5.        THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES-said that there was little to report in regard to(previous reference: Palestine. He thought that progress was being made in cabinet 28(39), Con-    justifying the White Paper proposals in Parliament,elusion 5.)The position as to public opinion in the United &quot;A.3/rl3^)J-r.     States was also not unsatisfactory.The position when the Government1s proposals were   laid before the Permanent Mandates commission might be somewhat more difficult.    The Commission was somewhat pro-Zionist in opinion, and might well takethe   view that the proposals in the White Paperinvolved a breach of the Mandate, in the spirit ifnot.  in the letter.In regard to Palestine itself, the Arabopposition   was perhaps not very formidable.    TheJews, on the other hand, had adopted a very stiffattitude.    There was, however, nothing in thesituation which called for any immediate decision.The Cabinet took note of this statement.
6. The Cabinet had under consideration a Memo-randum by the Minister without Portfolio (CP.-121(39))  covering the draft Ministry of Supply Bill,together with explanatory notes on Clauses and a copyof a letter from the Prime Minister&apos;s Advisory panel of Industrialists.The functions proposed to be conferred on thenew Ministry were as follows:-(a) the functions of supply,  design, research,experiment and inspection exercised by theWar Office (except in regard, to certain.inQ,.M.G. and other services needing furtherconsideration, now in progress);(b) the function of the supply of such storesof general user as may be convenient, and(c) the function of provision of essential rawmaterials,In order that the draft Bill should, also confer thenecessary legal power to establish a Ministry ofSupply in the fullest sense, provision was made thatthe powers actually to be exercised by this Ministryat any stage should be such powers as might be trans-ferred, to it by Order in Council,The Cabinet also had before them the following conclusions reached by the Committee of Home Affairs,who had. had the draft Bill under examination ^H.A.C.12th Conclusions (39)):-&quot;I. To reserve for determination by the Cabinetthe questions of policy raised in CP.-121(39) and in the draft Bill?    and, subjectthereto,II. To recommend the Cabinet to approve the  &apos;Ministry of Supply Bill in the form of thedraft annexe^ to CP.-121 (39)^ subject tofurther consideration of the points referredto in.the discussion, and in particular -(l) to consideration of the desirabilityof adding a. specific proviso to exclude the possibility of the Bill beinginterpreted as authorising the dilutionor conscription of labour?&apos;(2) to the omission of Claase 11 and toany further amendments  consequentialupon that omission?- 2k -
(5) to the substitution of * three years1for &apos;two years1  in line 3 of Clause13 (1)1(4) to consideration of the desirabilityof amending the long title of theBill and of adding provisions to regularise the functions now beingperformed by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster as Minister incharge of Food (Defence Plans);and subject also to any further drafting or other minor alterations that may befound necessary or desirable.lit. To authorise the introduction of the Billforthwith in the Bouse of Commons, with aview to First   Rending and publication takingplace before the end of the present week, and second Reading at an early date after the whitsun recess.&quot;THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Committee ofHome Affairs had thought it right to deal with thequestion of policy raised by Clause 11 of the Billowing to the fact th&quot;t the President of the Board ofTrade would be unable to be present at the Meeting of theCabinet held that morning..     The main point raised bythe President had been that under Clause 3 of the bill the Minister had very wide powers of requisitioningon which he could rely to satisfy his own requirements.If the real object of Clause 11 was to enable economic sanctions to be imposed on certain countries, theClause must fail to effect that purpose, becauseunder our Commercial Treaties with foreign countriesdiscriminatory prohibition of exports was not permissi-ble so long as those Treaties remained in force.     Ifit was thought right to take powers to impose economic sanctions, that should be done in a Bill intended forthat purpose, and not incidentally in the Ministry ofSupply Bill..
The Home Secretary explained that the Clause hadbeen suggested by the Prime Ministers Advisory Panel,in order to deal with the question of exports of scrap metal.       The Chairman of the Supply Board had informed the Home Affairs Committee that the Clauseraised so many difficulties and objections that he&quot;-vas in favour of its deletion from the Bill.This course was agreed to.The Cabinet next considered Clause 13. dealingwith the duration of Part II of the Bill.It was agreed that the duration of Part II ofthe Bill should be for three years, namely, for thesame period as the Military Training Bill and theReserve and Auxiliary Forces Bill./kt this point the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs left the Meeting^THE MINISTER V/ITHOUT PORTFOLIO said that, inaccordance with the decision of the Cabinet on the19th April (Cabinet 21 (39), Conclusion ll), the bill had   been drafted so as to enable a Ministry of supply in the full sense to be set up.     The limitation of theMinistry&apos;s functions to Army Supply would be effected by administrative action.The Minister thenreferred to Clause 12 of theBill.     He explained that this Clause, as drafted, gaveeffect to a decision re ched by the Committee ofImperial Defence, at their 356th Meeting (Conclusion(5)).     His own vie?/ was that the Clause, as drafted,was rightly drawn, but he felt that it was his duty to call attention to the Clause, as the Prime Minister&apos;sAdvisory Panel had protested strongly against itand would probably make representations to the PrimeMinister on the matter.
After discussion, it was agreed that this Clauseshould stand as draftedeTHE LORD PRIVY SEAL suggested that in theExplanatory Memorandum which would he published withthe Bill, it was desirable to explain that the grant payable under Clause 12 (5) did not represent all thata contractor would receive in respect of works to beundertaken by him under this Clause, since he wouldbe entitled to charge the remainder of the cost tohis customers as part of the contract price;      and that,in so far as the Government was concerned, they would accept such a charge as an element in the contractprice..Reference was made to the question whether Clause2(1) ( c) and Clause 18 as drafted would empower theMinister to dilute or conscript labour0It was explained that this matter had been fur-ther considered, and it was agreed that these Clausesdid not give the power in question.Consideration was then given to the questionwhether the scope of the Bill should be widened so asto incorporate additional Clauses dealing with (a) thetransfer of Ministerial responsibility for the Pood(Defence Plans) Department to the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, and (b) certain additional powers which that Department was now seekingoTHE CHANCELLOR OP &apos;JHK DUCHY OP LANCASTER explainedthat at the outset it had been hoped to arrange for thenecessary Clauses to be included in the Civil DefenceBill, but this course had been found to be impracticableQAs one of the Ministers responsible for the Civil
Defence Bill he concurred in this conclusion.     Themost satisfactory course would he to have a separate bill, but it was obviously impracticable to passad hoc legislation before the Summer Recess.     The only hope of obtaining these powers before the summer recess was, therefore, for the necessary Glauses to beincluded in the Ministry of Supply Bill.It was evident that there might be some diffi-culty in incliiding these Clauses, and after discussion the Cabinet agreed that if, on further investigation,it was found possible to include the Clauses in the     ministry of Supply Bill, the Minister without Portfolioshould have authority to include them.     If, however,this course was found impracticable, the matter shouldbe left on the present footing for the time being.The Cabinet -(l) approved the Ministry of Supply Bill inthe form annexed to CP.  1S1 (39),subject to -(a) the points dealt with in the Conclu-sions of the Committee of Home affairs and(b) the points dealt with in the discussionabove.( S) authorised the introduction of the Billforthwith in the House of Commons with aview to First Reading &quot;.nd publicationtaking plr,ce before the end of the present week, and Second Rending at an early dateafter the Whit sun Rececs.
LANDLORD 7.    The Cabinet had under consideration a MemorandumAMD TENANT(WAR by the Lord Chancellor (CP. 119 (39)) in    ,DAMAGE)BILL. which approval was sought,  in principle, for a Bill(Previous     to implement the Report of the Departmental CommitteeReference:Cabinet 60    on the Responsibility for the Repair of Premises damaged(38), Con-olusionH). by Hostilities (Cmd. 5934 of 1939).   A copy of theReport was attached to the Memorandum.   The need forsuch a Bill arose from the fact that landlords andtenants could no longer insure against damage byhostilities, as such damage had been excepted by theInsurance Companies from the scope of their policies.The Lord Chancellor expected to have a draft Billready very soon for examination by the Committee ofHome Affairs, and it seemed to be desirable, in theinterest of the business community and of the country generally, that the proposals of the Governmentshould be made public in peace-time.    He therefore proposed, subject to the approval of the Cabinet andthe Committee of Home Affairs,  to introduce the Billin the House of Lords during the current session.After the Lord Chancellor had explained themain points in his Memorandum, THE CHANCELLOR OP THEEXCHEQUER said that, while he agreed that a Bill on thelines proposed should form part of our war legislation and that the Government should announce acceptance ofthe Committee&apos;s recommendations, he thought it was undesirable that the Bill should be published at thepresent time.     Publication would only afford encouragement to the persons who suggested that it was the duty of theGovernment to insure all property against war at thepresent time.      For reasons of which his colleagues were aware, this course was impracticable.
THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he would hesatisfied if a statement could he made on the lines proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and if arrangements could he made for the immediate introductionof the Bill after the outbreak of war.The Cabinet agreed:(l)   To authorise an announcement to theeffect that the Government acceptedthe recommendations in the Reportof the Committee on the Responsibilityfor the Repair of Premises damaged by Hostilities (cmnd 593k):(2)    To authorise the Lord Chancellor toarrange for the drafting of thenecessary legislation and for theBill to be examined by the Committeeof Home Affairs:(3)   That no steps should be taken to publish the terms of the draft bill at the present time or for its introduction in peace time   withoutfurther reference to the Cabinet,
landlord and TENANT(WAR DAMAGE)(SCOTLAND)BILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 60 (38)Conclusion 11)8.    With reference to the previous item, THESECRETARY OP STATE POR SCOTLAND said that a Bill todeal with the corresponding position in Scotland was ready and he asked authority to submit the Bill,which raised no fresh question of principle, to theHome Affairs Committee without reference to theCabinet.The Cabinet agreed:To authorise the Secretary of Statefor Scotland to submit the landlord and Tenant (War Damage) (Scotland)Bill to the Home Affairs Committee,it being understood that the bill would not be published or introduced in peace-time without furtherauthority from the Cabinet.
GOVERNMENT 9.      THE PRIME MINISTER said that in connectionBUSINESS.with the two previous items on the Agenda, it wouldLegislativeProgramme he appropriate for him to make a statement in regard1938-39.to the Government&apos;s Legislative Programme.     The(Previous introduction of the Military Training Bill, the reference:&amp;Cabinet 5$ (38) Reserve and Auxiliary Forces Bill and the Ministry of conclusion 5.)H.        Supply Bill had seriously disarranged the existing programme.      The position had been very carefully examined by the Parliamentary Secretary to theTreasury, who had reached the conclusion that, onthe most favourable assumptions as to the time required for each stage,  the time required to pass into law by the hth August the absolutely essentialBills and a number of important Bills which figuredprominently in the Government&apos;s legislative programme tras Ik days more than was estimated to be available.The Prime Minister said that he was proposing to consider the matter further with theParliamentary Secretary who had certain suggestions to make as to how this puzzling situation could bedealt with.      In the meantime, it was clear that therewas no prospect   of   any fresh projects for legislation being passed into law during the presentParliamentary Session, unless those Bills were ofsuch vital urgency that it was essential that theyshould take the place of other   essential orimportant Bills.The Prime Minister mentioned that only inthe last few days proposals had been put forward(a) by the Board of Trade for another Export credits guarantee Bill, and (b) by the Treasury fora    Czechoslovak Balances Bills
The Prime Minister said that the situation was clearly a very difficult one and it was evidentthat any proposals for further Bills would have to be examined in a very critical spirit.     The first essential at the present time was that parliamentary counsel should be enabled to devote their time to thenecessary drafting in connection with the followingsix Bills which were absolutely essential:-1.     Ministry of Supply*2.      Shipping.3.     Agriculture.. 3/^)iu- * Lj..     Milk Subsidy Continuation.5.      War Risks Insurance.6.      Imperial Airways Merger.In addition, Parliamentary Counsel would ofcourse have    work    to do in connection with the civil defence Bill, the Finance Bill and other Bills now inprogress.The Prime Minister mentioned in this connectionthat the burden of work which has been imposed on theParliamentary Counsel in recent months had been very heavy indeed, and it was essential to take action to relieve the situationc      It was essential that parliamentary Counsel should be able to concentrate on the six Bills referred to above.     He asked hiscolleagues to ensure that any necessary instructions inconnection with these Bills were given as quickly aspossible,otherwise there was grave risk that the bills would not be available when they were required whichwould lead to a loss of Parliamentary time.     For thetime being, at any rate, work on other Bills would haveto take second placeB
THE MINISTER OP LABOUR referred to the bill dealing with^Loan Facilities inSHE PRIME MINISTER said he was not certain what theposition was as to this Bill, hut he undertook toconsider the matter.The Cabinet took note of the Prime Minister&apos;sstatement.
THE MENTAL 10.        In connection with the previousDEFICIENCY(SCOTLAND)      conclusion, the SECRETARY OP STATE FOR SCOTLAND(AMENDMENT)BILL. said that he had been considering the questionwhether an Emergency Bill should be introduced todeal with the result of a recent court decision,in consequence of which five hundred mental defectiveswere now being detained without proper legalauthority.    In view, however, of what the PrimeMinister had said as to the legislative programme,he would not press this matter at the present timeunless trouble arose.The Cabinet took note of this statement.
FRUSTRATION 11.     The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by of CONTRACTS.--- the Lord Chancellor i(O.P.. ISO (39)). calling the   &apos;Proposed  .Bill. attention of his colleagues to the Seventh InterimReport of&apos;the Law Revision Committee (Cmd. 6009 of 1939),(previous reference which dealt with a *?ule of law incidental to theCabinet 60(38), Con- doctrine of frustration of contracts and known toelusion 17).lawyers as the rule in Chandler v. Webster.     This rule,which dated from 1904, was that after a frustratingevent the loss &quot;lies where it falls&quot;.,    In the opinionof the Gommittee this rule led to injustice, andconstituted a defect in the doctrine of frustrationwhich ought to be removed by legislation.    The LordChancellor recommended the adoption of the Report,and, as the doctrine of frustration was of special importance in war-time, he asked his collaagues for authority to give instructions for the drafting of aBill to carry out the Report0THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that it was generally agreed that the rule in Chandler v. Webster led toinjustice and drew attention to the fact that the rulewas of great importance in wartime.    He thought that theBill would be unopposed, and hoped that it would bepossible to give the Bill a chance of passing into law.THE PRIME MINISTER said that,  in view of theposition in regard to the legislative programme, hethought this matter would have to stand over for thetime being.After further discussion, the Cabinet agreed:-(l) To approve in principle the adoption ofthe Seventh Interim Report of the law revision Committee (cmnd 6009).
(2)    To approve the proposal that assoon as the present congestion in the preparation of legislative&quot;business was relaxed, the LordChancellor should make arrangementsfor the drafting of the Bill to giveeffect to the Committee&apos;srecommendations and for itssubmission to the Home AffairsCommittee.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.23rd May, 1939.
