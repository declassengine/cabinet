THE BUDGET.(previous reference:Cabinet St(38), Con-elusion 1.)2. THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUERcommunicated to the Cabinet full details ofhis financial proposals for the forthcoming budget, which were approved by the Cabinet.In view of the great importance of secrecy, the details, in accordance withprecedent, are not recorded in the cabinet minutes.
COMPULSORYMILITARYTRAINING.(previous reference cabinet 21(39) Con-clusion 7, )30 The Cabinet had before tham. a secret memorandum (CP. 91 (39)), circulated by directionof the Prime Minister, indicating the lines upOnwhich a measure   of Compulsory Military Trainingmight be arranged.It was pointed out by way of introductionthat the proposals contained in the Memorandum were intended &quot;both to be an earnest of our determination to resist aggression and also to provide a solution for certain urgent problems of defence preparednessduring prolonged periods of tension, and that, inaddition, they had been designed to avoid so far aspossible arousing the opposition of the labour movement.    Thus, it was not proposed either that thescheme for Compulsory Military Training shouldsupersede our traditional methods of voluntary service, or that it should become a permanent feature of our system.    The Memorandum also made it clearthat, unless and until war should break out,Compulsory Military Training would be confined topurposes of Home Defence *Under existing arrangements,  it wa.s,generally speaking, impossible to mobilise any ofthe Reserve or Auxiliary Forces without the declarationof a State of Emergency.    It was therefore proposedto introduce legislation to enable the King,byOrder in Council, to empower the Admiralty and the secretaries of State for War and Air to call outthe whole or any part of the members of the Reserveor Auxiliary Forces without a Royal Proclamation.Measures of partial mobilisation or demobilisationwould then be able to be taken in the light of changing circumstances without further powers from parliament. It was suggested that, as a
-4,corollary to this, the Emergency Powers (Defence) Bill(D.O.R.A.) should he passed into law forthwith onthe understanding that the Government would only usesuch of the powers conferred as were necessary.    Inorder to avoid public alarm, however,  it might headvisable for the title of the Bill to be changed to the Exceptional Powers (Defence) Bill.Powers would at the same time be taken, ina Military Training Bill,to call up for militarytraining all the men born in a particular1 year,e*g. , 1919, or those aged 20 years on a particulardate.    The number of men likely to be availableeach year under this scheme would be between200,000 and 250,000, of whom 80,000 would becalled up in batches and trained for service in theAir Defence of Great Britain, the remainder beingattached to Field Army units.    Attached to theMemorandum was ah Appendix containing the detailed proposals of the War Office in this regard.When the scheme was in full operation,it would enable a permanent nucleus of our air defences to be manned continuously.    During the intervening period, however,  it was suggested thatthese defences should be manned in the first instance by Territorial units and later by Regular Reservists,to be called up for this purpose.Finally, the Memorandum contained certaintentative proposals for meeting the criticism thatany form of conscription of labour should be accompanied by a measure of conscription of wealth.
8THE PRIME MINISTER explained the salient points inthe Memorandum.     The outstanding poin$ was theproposal to introduce a limited measure of compulsory-military service in a form which on the one hand wouldcommend itself to those who felt the need of such ascheme without on the other hand arousing irreconcilableopposition from the working-classes, which might havebeen raised by a wider scheme.     There was great pressure on this country to introduce some scheme of compulsory military training, not only from Prance butalso from the United States0The Prime Minister said that personally he had long been in favour in principle of a scheme of compul-sory military training, but until recently he had regarded,the introduction of such a scheme as impracticable byreason of the opposition which it would arouse in TradeUnion circles.     He thought, however, that the scheme now proposed would overcome some of the principal objec-tions which would be felt in these circles to theprinciple of compulsory military training.     He referredto the pledge which had been given by Lord Baldwin onthe 1st April, 1936, that he would not introduce ameasure of conscription so long as peace prevailed.     he himself had renewed that undertaking;   but he thoughtthat, while we were not actually at war, it was amockery to call the present conditions &quot;peace&quot;, and these undertakings did not therefore disturb him.The Prime Minister referred to the disadvantages in which we were placed by not being able to take themeasures essential to our safety without an amount of publicity calculated to create alarm.     Other countries,however, were in a position to carry out partial orselective measures of mobilisation, of which we couldoften only obtain full information from secret sources.
Our present arrangements were &quot;based on theassumption that before heing attacked we should receive a certain amount of warningo     We had had severalillustrations lately of the extreme embarrassment which resulted from having to decide whether or not weshould proclaim that a State of Emergency existed.He felt very strongly that it was right that we shouldchange our methods so as to be in a proper positionto meet a threat of su&amp;ilaa air attacks in the plan before the Cabinet the scheme for compulsory military training had been linked with arrangements to enable us to meet the continuous stateof emergency in which we in fact lived.     But, in orderto avoid exciting alarm, it was proposed to refer toTexceptional powers&apos; and to make arrangements designedto Improve our state of preparedness, rather than to declare a state of Emergency&apos;,,     The realapprehension of the Labour Party was that the GovernmentShould introduce conscription as part Qf our normal peace-time system0     It followed,, therefore, that thefact that the scheme for compulsory military trainingwas to be closely linked to the other exceptionalpowers *e be expressly authorised by Parliament,and would be limited in duration to the period during which those exceptional powers continued inforce, was likely to be regarded by Trade Unioncircles as a great safeguards     This limitation was, nodoubt, a disadvantage from the point of view of theSecretary of State for War, but there was no reason why,if on experience the scheme turned out to have advantagesnot appreciated at the outset, and was not attended by the risks and dangers apprehended in certaincircles, it should not be made permanent,
4 AA second point, which the Prime minister thought would appeal to Trade Union circles, wasthe fact that the scheme was not intended tosupersede our existing voluntary methods, but to supplement them.     Further, men enlisted underthe scheme would not be liable for service overseas unless and until war broke out.The conscription of wealth was a phrasewhich was frequently used but rarely defined.Nevertheless, he thought that it would he diffi-cult to put forward even the present limitedscheme for compulsory military training without some statement in general terras to the effect thatthere must be a sacrifice from those whosecontribution would necessarily take the f&amp;m, 0?contributing part of their wealth.      In regard tothe suggested control over the profits of firmsmainly engaged in the re-armament programme, thePrime Minister thought that it might be necessarythat certain of the firms in question should betaken over and asked to crrry out this work on an agency basis, receiving their expenses and costs,together with some return on the capital employed.There was no exact precedent for the step pro-posed, which was certainly drastic.     This matter was being investigated in the Treasury and he understood that it was thought that a practicablescheme of this kind could be devised.     unless some scheme of this kind was put into operation,the suspicion     would always persist that somemanufacturers were in fact making large profits,notwithstanding attempts to control such profitsby means of the terms of the contracts placed,or by subsequent taxation.       The last sentence
1 i1 of paragraph 4, was concerned with the ideal thatwe sh.-u.ld desire to see realised, namely that no person should he richer at the end of a war than he was at the. beginning of a war8     Something mightbe done by means of a register of the property of individuals at the beginning and at the end of awar.In regard to paragraph 7, THE FIRST LORD OFTHE ADMIRALTY and THE MINISTER OF LABOUR referredto the need for securing that men who were called up did not lose their jobs,.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that this was most desirable, and we should do all we could to ensureit, but thought it would probably be impossible tosecure this result by specific legislation.Dealing with the Exceptional Powers (Defence)Bill,&apos; the Prime Minister referred to the proposal in paragraph 10 of the Memorandum that parliament should be asked to pass the Bill into law forthwith,on the understanding that the Government would onlyexercise such of the powers as were necessary tomeet the situation immediately confronting us, orany changed situation that we might be called uponto meet.     He thought that a proposal on these linesmight be regarded as putting too much power in thehands of the Government, which would always be in aposition to represent that it was necessary toexercise cc. to. in of these powers.     He &apos; therefore proposed an alternative scheme, whereby thepowers under the Act would not be exercisable until a State of Emergency had been declared, except as provided for certain purposes to be enumerated in .a Schedule,     These latter powers would be those required for the purpose of adequate prepara&amp;eiiess?
1 9e.g., the requisitioning of land for the immediatepurposes of the armed forces.      If, later, it was found desirable to exercise other powers in theBill over and above those covered by the Schedule,those other powers would not be exercisable until after the House of Commons had approved a Regulationunder the Act by passing an affirmative Resolution.With regard to paragraph 16 of the Memorandum,the Prime Minister said that he thought that consider-ation should be given by the Ministers concerned tothe question whether the fact that men had undertakencertain A.R.P. Services should be taken as a ground for exemption from Compulsory Military Training.The Prime Minister then referred to the timetable for dealing with these proposals.     His present intention was to invite the General Council of theTrades Union Congress to meet him before any public announcement was made.     He proposed to explain thescheme to thern as a matter of courtesy, and he hopedthat he could persuade them that there was no ulteriormotive in the scheme.     But he did not propose toask for their specific approval to the scheme.     he hoped to meet the General Council of the Trades UnionCongress and the Leaders of the Opposition on Wednesdayand to announce the scheme in Parliament the same day.In reply to the Secretary of State for Air,tjie Prime Minister said that it was desirable thatthe scheme should be announced before Friday. Itwould be desirable for His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador inBerlin to communicate the decision to the GermanGovernment, before it was publicly announced;   and
4  STlthis was one of the reasons for which he had thoughtit desirable to expedite the Ambassador&apos;s return.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME affairs thought that all his colleagues were in favour ofthe scheme for Compulsory Military Training.     he pointed out, however, that the draft Emergency PowersBill contained some very formidable provisions, whichit might be difficult to get through the House ofCommons.     In 1914, the Government had merely askedin very general terms for power to make defence regulations, and some difficulty had been experienced in the Courts owing to the vagueness of the languageused.     The present Bill contained twelve Clauses and set out a number.of matters in great detail.     he doubted whether the prime Minister&apos;s revised proposal,namely, that the powers in the Act should not be exercisable until a state of emergency had beondeclared, would be regarded in Parliament as much ofa safeguard   since it was the Government of the daywhich decided whether to declare an emergency.     would it not be possible to take all the powers requiredto deal with requisitioning, etc.  in the proposedMilitary Training Bill, and to postpone legislation in regard to the other matters included in theEmergency Powers (Defence) Bill?THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he was concerned that the presentation of our proposals should not put undue emphasis on service on the Home Front, as this would be most
unfortunate from the point of view of opinion in the foreign countries.     He was also concernedlest considerable delay should ensue while thenecessary legislation was being passed.     Forexample, it appeared to him that the provisions dealing with exemption from military training might require a good deal of consideration.THE PRIME MINISTER explained that he had it inmind that the Bill should be passed under a guillotineresolution and without much delay.Continuing, ?HE FOREIGN SECRETARY said thathe was in general agreement with the views expressed&apos;by the Home Secretary.     He asked whether the PrimeMinister&apos;s scheme ruled out the possibility ofmaking arrangements forthwith to call out suchTerritorials and Army Reservists as it was desiredto call out by an immediate declaration of a stateof emergency.      It would, of course, be necessary toexplain very carefully the reasons why we were obliged to declare a state of emergency before itwas possible for us to call out these troops.THE PRIME MINISTER said that advice had beengiven to the effect that a declaration of a state ofemergency might have disastrous effects in the City,not necessarily on British but on foreign holders of sterling securities-THE HOME SECRETARY expressed doubts whetherit would be possible to get the Emergency Powers(Defence) Bill passed unless jjublic opinion was convinced that the situation was a very serious one.
15THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER expressed general agreement with the Home Secretary1^ views.He pointed out that Clause I (2) (a) of the pro-posed Bill amounted, in effect, to the suspension ofthe Habeas Corpus Act.     He did not think that itwould be much of an answer to say in the House ofCommons that these powers could not be exerciseduntil war started.     The atmosphere if the Bill wastaken now would be quite different from the atmosphere which would exist in war.     He did notthink that this Bill could be passed quickly and hewondered whether the powers needed at once could notbe included in the Military Training Bill.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR, while agreeing that there was force in these arguments, thought thatthe draft Emergency Powers Bill should be examinedto see whether certain parts of it should not be passed into law at once.     He referred in particular to the difficulties in regard to acquisition ofland, where the existing procedure ought to bespeeded up.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRSconsidered that, while the Emergency Powers (Defence)Bill might - require amendment, the right course wasto pass the Bill into law at the present time.     Hesuggested that the Bill should be divided into two parts, namely, first the powers which would be exercisable in peace, and secondly those which wouldbe exercisable in war.     He thought that if war broke out there would be urgent need of emergency powers,andthere might be difficulty in getting the Bill passed by,Parliament in the conditions which were likely to existat the outbreak of war.     If the matter was left tillwar broke out, the Government might find themselveswithout many essential powers.-12-
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR ratherdoubted whether the temper of the House of commons would be altogether favourable to passing a Bill,on the lines now i^proposed, under a guillotine reso- Ilution. He thought that Parliament would be generally -favourable to the ssheme set out in CP. 91 (39) as a Jwhole, hut that if strong objection was raised to anumber of clauses in the Emergency Powers Bill,&quot; v.&quot; Imatters might become somewhat difficult.THE MINISTER OP HEALTH suggested that the right fcourse would be to declare a state of emergency forth-with and to work backwards from that step.     Thus,all the Territorial anti-aircraft units would becalled out at once and a system of reliefs should bearranged afterwards.     He thought that the likelihood of a sudden air attack on this country would beincreased by introducing legislation on the lines proposed.     We ought not to be left defenceless in the interval before the legislation was passed.TEE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE expressed agreement with this view.     He added that he thoughtthat it would be useful if the Government spokesmanin the House of Commons, when introducing the pro-posed legislation, was in a position to explain that under the existing arrangements it had &quot;been necessaryto declare an emergency before we could call out theTerritorial personnel of our air defences.Discussion ensued whether8 if the procedure of declaring a state of emergency was followed, therewould be power to select the units or individuals who should be called out in lieu of embodying all theTerritorial anti-aircraft units.
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR thoughtthat this procedure was legal.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OFDEFENCE referred.to the difficulties inherent incalling out one-third of the personnel of theTerritorial anti-aircraft units.     He pointedout that, if an emergency subsequently arose,some of the units would not he at their properwar stations.     He thought that the betterprocedure would &quot;be to call out the whole force.THIS SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR pointedout that from the employers&apos; point   of view there was much to he said for calling out only one-third ofthe personnel of the Territorial anti-aircraft units at a time.     He proposed to make his selection bycalling out whole units, which would subsequently be relieved by other units.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLANDasked whether, if a Proclamation was madedeclaring a state of emergency, and we then limitedourselves to calling out the anti-aircraft defences,this would have a bad effect in countries abroadwhich took more interest in our Field Force.
0JL OTHE SECRETARY OP STATS FOR FOREIGN affairs said that his idea had &quot;been that we should explain that the declaration of an emergency was a purelytechnical matter, which happened to he the onlyprocedure which enabled us to mobilise our Reserveor Auxiliary Forces.     He thought that, in additionto calling out the Territorial personnel of the air defence of Great Britain, we should also call upArmy Reservists to fill up certain Regular units and to start training the personnel for the air defence of Great Britain.     The French would hesatisfied if they knew that we were also taking steps to strengthen units in our Field-Force.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was evidentthat the Cabinet could not reach a decision withoutfurther information.     He suggested accordingly thatthe question should he remitted to an ad hoc Committeeof the Cabinet.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH suggested that thequestion whether we should take steps to callout reservists before introducing the proposed legislation, or whether legislation should beintroduced before the reservists and auxiliary forces were called out, was a matter of principle which should be decided by the Cabinet.-15.
4 f\THE PRIME&quot; MINISTER asked, the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs what effect he thought theDeclaration of Emergency would have in Germany,,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thoughtthat our Ambassador in Berlin could explain the altua-tion to the Genii an Government.     At the same time he &apos;did not view the situation so seriously as to beperturbed by a delay of a few days or a week in the manning of our air defences.     After all, we had beenliving in a period of high tension for some weeltsBtthout our ground air defences being manned and he didnot think that the introduction of the proposed legis-lation was likely to make the threat of a sudden air attack a reality.     At the same time, he would be glad of time in which to reflect on the matter. -    He had asked sir Nevile Henderson what effect these proposals wouldhave on Herr Hitler, but Sir Nevile had not expressedany definite opinion.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH reminded the foreign secretary that at the last meeting of the Cabinet hehad suggested that it was likely that the international situation might become more difficult.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS repliedthat this had led him to the conclusion that the stepsproposed should be announced before Herr Hitlersspeech on the 28th April.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought thediscussion had served a very useful purpose in enabling the various points of view to be advanced.     He also thought that no final decision should be reached that evening, not even on the points put forward by the Ministerof Health.     He suggested that the question should beconsidered later that evening by- -awCommittee of iMini-s^rs.
He proposed that, when the quest lor had &quot;been examined in more detail^and further information obtained on        ^certain points, it should again be considered by theCabinet at a special meeting to be held at 6 p.m. on tuesday, 25th April, 1939.This course was agreed to.In the course of further discussion, the followingpoints were raised.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR said that he hoped thatthe exemptions would be as few as possible,     At the sametime he thotight that it would be necessary to arrange fora certain number of postponements.     He gave the followingparticulars of the numbers concerned in various age groups:-2Year.      j  Total Males in the . Total in Column 2 includedi Age Group. in Schedule of ReservedI Occupations.IS i 425,000 75,00019 I 450,000 90,000I     20 j 310,000 60,000He explained that most of the occupations in. the schedule of Reserved Occupations were not reserved in respectof persons under 25 years of age, and it followed that persons aged 18-20 who were in reserved occupations were all in occupations of the first importance, and that mostof them ware important from the point of view of the rearmament Programme.      If these persons were to be called up it would be necessary to arrange for others to take their places.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR aaid that the com-puleory military training proposals would have certainreactions on the Air Forces   50 per cent^.    of the regularentrants in which were under 21.     At least 17 per cent, ofthe non regular entrants were under 21.     He thought thataspect of the matter should be considered.
THE PRESIDENT OP THB BOARD OP TRADE enquiredwhat would he the effect on the Territorial Army,as a whole, of the present proposals.     He asked what the position would he if the scheme continued for five years,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said thatthe scheme was certainly likely to have some adverse effect on recruiting for the Territorial Army,     he proposed, however, to continue his campaign tar-obtaining volunteer recruits for the TerritorialArmy.     The men who had already enlisted had of courseengaged themselves and the adverse effect would onlybe felt in regard to future recruits.     He was glad to hear that the Minister of Labour favoured as fewexemptions as possible     He thought that one of the big points in favour of the scheme was that it wouldbe of universal application, without any favour to individuals.     Every man could fairly be asked toundertake six months training.     He thought, however^that It would be necessary to make some provision in respect of conscientious objectors.     As regardsthe age, he had suggested 20 because this was unlikely to interfere with recruitment for the RegularArmy, most of which took place before the age of 20.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP EDUCATIONsaid that six months at the age of 2*9 would outright into the middle of a University career.In reply to a question by the President ofthe Board of Trade whether consultation would take plaee
e$ 9with the Territorial Associations, THE SECRETARY of state FOR WAR said that when the Prime minister had announced the general principles of thescheme he proposed to discuss it withthe Central Council of the TerritorialAssociations.     The Territorial AssociationsAdvisory Committee had already expressed the viewthat there should he conscription.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY&apos;and THECHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER asked that consideration should he given to the suggestion that men enlisted under the new scheme shoulddescribed as belonging to the Militia,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR in reply said,that it was not proposed to form new units outof the men enlisted under the proposed scheme andthat he did not therefore see how this proposal could be accepted.The Cabinet agreed -To refer the proposals in CP. 91(39)for further consideration, in thelight of the discussion which hadtake place, to a committee composed as follows:-The Prime Minister,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Home Secretary,The Foreign Secretary,The Dominions Secretary,The Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence andThe Secretary of State for Warwith instructions to report to theCabinet at a Meeting to be held on tuesday, 25th April at 6.0 p.m* in thePrime minister&apos;s room in - Houseof Commons,
