THE international situation.CONVERSATIONS WITHTHE ROUMANIAN,FOREIGN MINISTER.(Previous reference;Cabinet 21(39),Conclusion 2).Relations with turkey.Relations with bulgaria.in.&quot; ev*&quot;s s&apos;ii1. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS said that a full account of the conversations with M. Gafencu would hecirculated later, and he would, therefore,content himself with a summary of the salient points.Mo Gafencu had begun by giving a reportof his recent contacts with Turkey, with whichhe was satisfied.     Both countries wereanimated by the desire to strengthen theB a. Ik an Entente,,While M. Gafencu did not exclude thepossibility of some territorial concession to Bulgaria, he thought that it was in thehighest degree unwise that the matter should beraised at the present time, and until we were satisfied that Bulgaria intended to he a loyalmember of the Entente.     Both Greece and turkey were convinced that for the moment theright course was to concentrate on drawingBulgaria into the Balkan Entente.     An invitationhad been sent to Bulgaria to attend a meetingof the Entente to deal with economic matters.The Foreign Secretary said tlvt he was convinced that this was the right course, andthat any rash promises of territorial concessions in the Dobrudja might start a conflagration inthe Balkans.
Relations with M. Gafencu was fairly well satisfied asPoland.to the results of his recent interview with colonel Beck.     He thought that Colonel Beckrecognised that the Roumanian-Polish Alliancecould he made one of general application, and,in particular, that it should apply to aggressionon the part of Germany as well as aggression by russia.     It had been agreed that to make the alliance effective for this purpose, staff conversations between the two countries were required and Colonel Beck had agreed that theseStaff Conversations should take place at an appropriate moment.     Broadly, nothing berydefinite had emerged from LI. Gafencu&apos;s interview with Colonel Beck, but the atmosphere between thetwo countries had improved.Relations M. Gafencu had also seen Herr Hitler andwith Germany.Herr con Ribbentrop on his way to London.     Nothreats had been uttered, and the atmosphere hadbeen quite satisfactory.     He thought that herr Hitler was &quot;prepared to be excited&quot; aboutDanzig and the colonies and that Herr Hitler&apos;sspeech on the 28th would contain a good dealabout the injustices from which Germany suffered,demands for fair treatment from the world, andabuse of President Roosevelt, together withreferences to Danzig and the return of the formerGerman Colonies.     He thought, however, that herr Hitler did not want war, and that no doorswould be banged in the speech on the 28th April.
Relations with The Foreign Secretary had been surprisedRussia.at the strength of Li. Gafencu&apos;s feelings aboutRussia?    M. Gafencu had expressed the view thatif war was certain he would wish to get into closer relations with Russia, but that if therewas even a small chance of avoiding war thiscourse would be undesirable, since closer relations between Russia and Roumania were likelyto make war certain.M. Gafencu was going to visit Rome andBelgrade on his return.     He had had a message from the Roumanian Minister at Belgrade withwhich he was fairly well satisfied.The Foreign Secretary said that M. Gafencu,who had created a favourable impression upon him,had testified to the valuable results of theFrench and British guarantee to Roumania, whichhad shown that Great Britain and France virerenot disinterested in South-Eastern Europe.The Cabinet took note of this statement.
THE IN^international TONAL 2. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGNSITUATION. (Confd)- AFFAIRS reminded his colleagues that on theTHE SOVIET UNION * ^14th April we had made a proposal to the Soviet(Previous Government.    Our suggestion had been that the reference.&apos;Cabinet 21 Soviet Government, basing themselves on Stalin&apos;s(39), Con-elusion 2,) speech, should make a. public declaration thatin the event of an act of aggression against any european neighbour of the Soviet Union which wasresisted, that Government would render assistance,if desired, in such manner as would be most convenient .On the 18th April^ the Soviet Government had made a counter proposal for a tripartite Agree-ment of Mutual Assistance in the event of aggression in Europe against any of the three parties - Great Britain, France and. Russia,    mheAgreement woul^ be to render military assistanceto Eastern European States.   Provisions were proposed, for a pledge not. to conclude a separate peace, for Staff conversations, and for a special agreement between the three Powers e.n* Turkey,On the 21st April^we had. sent to the FrenchGovernment the outline of our proposed reply to moscow, and had asked for their comments,    ^hemain point o* our proposed reply was that theSoviet Government&apos;? proposal took too littleaccount of practical difficulties.    In particular,Poland would object to a tripartite Agreementproviding for Soviet assistance to Poland whether&apos; v&quot; &apos; : .   . &apos;    .or not the latter wanted it.    There was also theIpoint that Pol an-1 would object to a tripartitejAgreement o^ Mutual Assistance between the three great Powers, since certain forms of Soviet-assistance could only be afforded to us through-4-/ Tel. No. 71 j6 Tel0 No. 69 as   Tel. No. 15k
Poland.    In our view, therefore, the time was notripe for so comprehensive a proposal, and we proposed to ask the Russian Government to give further consideration to our plan, which aimed atgiving early protection where it was most needed and did not ask the Soviet Government to do more than tocome in when we were already involved.The views of the French Government, whichwere set out in telegram No. 118 from. Paris, hadbeen received the previous day and hat? beendiscussed at a Meeting of the Foreign PolicyCommittee.    The French reply stated that theywere in agreement with our views, and they appre-clated that the Polish Government would object toan Agreement for Soviet assistance to Poland,whether direct or indirect, or to a unilateral declaration ^y the Soviet Government of direct or indirect assistance to Poland.    The French Govern-ment proposed a tripartite Agreement between GreatBritain, France and Russia, providing, first, thatif Great Britain and France were at war withGermany in consequence of fulfilling their obliga-tions to Eastern European countries, Russia would assist them:    secondly, that if, as a result ofgiving this assistance, Russia was at war withGermany, Great Britain and France would assist her.The Foreign Secretary pointed out that theFrench proposal ^or a tripartite Agreement must-involve at least indirect Soviet assistance to poland,, since ex hypothesi Great Britain and france would already be assisting Poland against Germany.mhe French Government proposal was therefore opento the objection which they had themselves urged.In other respects also the French proposal seemedto be somewhat  confused.-5-
The Cabinet were informed that at their meeting on April 25th (P.P. (36) hhth Conclusions)the Committee on Foreign Policy had in effect agreedthat, subject to the approval of the Cabinet, theForeign Secretary should be authorised to reply to paris Telegram No. 188 on the lines approved by theForeign Policy Committee, viz:    that our reply shouldembody inter alia the criticisms:(l)   that we found it difficult to understand how a close Mutual Assistance Pact between France, GreatBritain and Russia which the French desired in condition(b) would not, in the circumstances which we all had inmind at the present time, provoke the disastrousreactions from the Polish Government apprehended incondition (a), and(2)   that the meaning to be attached to the french proposals as given in the 5th and 6th paragraphs onpage 2 of Telegram No, 188 was not clear to us.     our reply might also embody the argument that our suggestion to Russia that she should offer help toStates victims of aggression who asked for it in whatever form seemed most desirable could in no circumstances involve the Soviet Government in a single-handed war with the Axis Powers.     Great Britain wouldex hypothesi be in the war already and be bound byprecise obligations.- 6The references are to Telegram No. 188from Paris.
The Foreign Secretary said that, the general conclusion which he had reached was that the valueof Russia as a potential Ally was by no means as high as seemed to ^e believed, by prominent membersof the Labour Party.   He referred, in this con-nection, to the Report from the Chiefs of Staff(CP.-95 (39)), which had. been circulated to theCabinet.    We should, of course, endeavour to orderour policy so that, if war broke out, Russia would,be either neutral or should come in on our side.At the same time it was essential to bear in mind the effects of our relations with Russia on Poland.Roumania and other countries, not excluding Germany.His conclusion, therefore, was as followsWe should, not act in such a way as to forgo the chance of Russian help in war:    we should not &quot;jeopardise the common front with Poland, and weshould not jeopardise the cause of peace.The Foreign Secretary concluded by sayingthat no &quot;doubt our policy in this matter would, beviolently attacked.   We had, however, a goodease to defend.    We had. given certain assurancesto Rourcania and Poland, and we had asked russia to give similar assurances.   If we were to go further we should run a serious risk of brea.kingthe common front which we were endeavouring toestablish.The Cabinet expressed general approvalof the policy vis-a-vis Soviet Russiaoutlined to him by the Foreign secretary as summarised above and agreed that theForeign Secretary should be authorised to despatch forthwith a telegram to H.M.Ambassador in Paris (in reply to telegram 188) on the lines of the replyproposed and approved by the ForeignPolicy Committee and explained to theCabinet by the Foreign Secretary (seepage 6 of these conclusions).
ALLEGEDITALIAN ANDGERMANACTIVITIESIN SPAIN.(previous reference:Cabinet 21 (39)Conclusion 5.)3*      THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS -said that no further alarming rumours had beenreceived in the previous week as to the activitiesof foreign troops in Spaliio     On the 22nd April,our Ambassador had reported that, according to theMinistry of Marine, the Madrid Victory Parade hadbeen indefinitely postponedo     A telegram had beensent asking for further information to which the embassy had replied that there, had been references in the Spanish Press on the 20th April to theMadrid Parade as taking place on the 15th May,adding that General Franco would fix the- exact date.Our Ambassador was making further enquiries.In the meantime, there ware no indications that the Italians had altered their decision towithdraw from Spain, and reports had been receivedshowing that withdrawals were already taking place.Thus, the Consul General in Naples had reported the arrival there of 2,000 troops on the 17th April.Our Consul at Palma had reported the departure of30 Italian air mechanics and aircraft gunners;that an official farewell to the German   and ItalianAir Force personnel would take place on the 22nd April:and that the programme provided for officials and men leaving in batches over the next few weeks.Certain Italian bombers and fighters had been paid for by the Spanish Government and would remain in spain.The Cabinet took note of thisstatemento
U tiITALY.Indexationswith Prance.[(previous reference;Cabinet 21 (39)Conclusion 8.)I Activities inI Libya.AIN.      THE SECRETAHY OP STaTE FOR FOREIGN affairs-tosaid that he had no further news on the suggestionthat the French Government should make an approach to Rome in order to settle the differences between france and Italy.     M. Bonnet was in favour of suchan approach but M. Daladier was opposed to it.     sir eric Phipps had used the argument with M. Daladierthat the announcement which was to be made that afternoon in the House of Commons as to the adoption by this country of Compulsory Military Training wouldenable France to make such an approach from strengthand not from weakness^ It remained to be seen whether this argument would prevail with M. Daladier.THE SECRETARY OF STaTE FOR INDIA asked theForeign Secretary if he had any further informationbearing on the telegrams from our Consul at Benghasireporting that schools had been closed and thatItalians were leaving for Italy,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said he had no further information bearing on these reports which were in a line with many similar reports received in the last three or four months.     He thoughtthat Italy was making preparations against thepossibility of war, but he did not believe that Italywanted war.     This view was, of course, liable to bedisproved at any moment.   . But he thought it was clearthat Herr Hitler had plans arranged for a number of possible eventualities and that this was part of atechnique designed to keep us in a state of constantalarm.
Return ofH.M. ambassador to Berlin.GERMANY.whether our Ambassador had seen Herr von Ribbentropsince his return to Berlin.5.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR SCOTLAND asked the SECRETARY OP STaTE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRS(previous reference;Cabinet 21 (39)Conclusion 3*)said that he had not seen him on the first day of his return, but he thought that there had been some validreason why this had not been possible.     Our ambassador had instructions to inform the German Government that morning of the announcement to be made that afternoon in the House of Commons in regard to compulsory military Training.He was not certain, however, whether SirHovile Henderson would make this communication toHepr von Ribbentrop or to Dr.  Weizsacker.
6. The Cabinet had. before them the following memoranda by the Secretary of State for the Colonies(1)    CP, - 79 (39), covering the draft ofa proposed White Paper on Policy inPalestine:(2)    CP.-89 (39), circulating for the informationof his colleagues the draft Conclusions ofthe 10th Meeting of the Cabinet Committeeon Palestine, which had been held toconsider the points raised at the Meeting&apos;&apos; of the Cabinet noted in the margin.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES said thatthere were a number of questions requiring decision, buthe was not sure whether the Cabinet would be able toreach conclusions on them that morning.The draft White Paper had been con.sid.ered at twoor three meetings of the Cabinet Committee on palestine and was now in a form in which it could be published at anearly date, subject to consideration of a few further amendments.The first point to be determined was whether theGovernment should forthwith announce their decision on policy and publish the White Paper, or whetherpublication should be postponed indefinitely.     TheCabinet Committee had decided in favour of an early announcement of our policy, subject to the proviso that the Palestine question must be determined in thelight of the general international situation, and thatit would be desirable to have time for furtherconsideration of our announcement after Herr Hitler&apos;sspeeoh on the 28th April.The main arguments for and against early publication might be summarised as follows:-In favour of postponement, the following considerations might be urged:-
(1)    An announcement would arouse the bitterhostilitjr of the Jews, who would chargeus with a breach of faith and cowardice.We had been warned Toy Dr0 Weizmann thatthe announcement of our policy might result in the Jews in Palestine havingrecourse to physical violence, which weshould have to put down by force.(3)    The Jews exercised a certain influence in the United States, and they would do their best to make the publicationof the White Paper the occasion to stirup agitation.      The view taken by theAmerican Ambassador was that, while theJews.would not be able to work up a strongpro-Jew agitation, they might be in aposition to work up an anti-British one.It was true that this agitation might onlylast for two or three months, but thosemight be vital months in which the full support of United States public opinion would be of immense value to us0(3)    The White Paper proposals would arouseconsiderable criticism in the House ofCommons.     The proposals cut acrossevery Party, but in the main the Labourand Liberal Opposition would oppose the scheme bitterly, and there wouldalso be strong opponents among theConservative Party.     This would be unfortunate at a time when we desired asmuch unity in Parliament as we could obtain,but he had no doubt that the Government    /could carry their policy through theHouse.(4)    Under strong pressure from the neighbouring arab States, we had introduced into ourscheme/^ riwMibci&quot; off points&apos;which we should have preferred to have omitted.      It mightbe argued (though he himself doubted the wisdom of this course) that if we couldpostpone the.announcement of policy, we might have an opportunity of revising the scheme so as to eliminate these weakpoints.The arguments in favour of animmediate decision were as follows:-(1)    So long as uncertainty as to our policycontinued, opinion in Palestine would beunsettled, and we should have troublefrom both Arabs and Jews.(S)    Protracted informal discussions were beingcarried on with the Egyptian Governmentand the other neighbouring Arab States.We had, in fact, virtually reached agreement v/ith them on the main lines ofour policy, and the representatives of these states were expecting an early announcement.&apos;
A good deal of suspicion would be caused w.p. an announcement wereindefinitely postponed.     While anearly announcement might embitterfeeling against us in the UnitedStates, it would go a long way to recover for us the sympathy of theArab and Moslem world in general.(3)    Finally, our policy, as a whole, was right and just, and we should have to announce it sooner or later.     why should, we not therefore obtain theadvantages which we might gain byan early announcement?The Colonial Secretary said that, tocomplete the picture, he should add two points.First that informal discussions were being carried on by telegraph with the representatives of Egypt andthe other neighbouring Arab States, who were preparedto agree in principle to our proposals.     We were no longer negotiating with the representativesof the Palestinian Arabs.     While it was proposedthat the White Paper should be issued as adeolaration of our policy without any formal agreementwith any other Parties, we hoped that, afterpublication, the representatives of the neighbouring arab States would issue a statement to the effectthat, while the policy did not give the Arabs allthat they had asked for, they jwopcuDQd fro&quot; advised the Palestinian Arabs to cease their violentcourses and to return to   constitutional methodsof procedure.     He felt bound to add, however,that if we. decided tg take some drastic actionneighbouring Arab States might not make thispronnouncement.
The second point to which he referredwas the importance of taking some action to easematters for the Jews.     Any drastic action whichwe decided to take against the Mufti would, ofcourse, help in this direction.     But the colonial secretary thought we ought to go further and tooffer to make available for Jewish immigration some british territory in.another part of the world.This matter had been under consideration for sometime past in the Colonial Office, and it wasagreed that British Guiana, where there was muchsuitable land, was by far the most hopefulpossibility.The Colonial Secretary said that he had discussed the matter with the Governor of british guiana wfee*iH%e&quot;iweH^^ The Governor&apos;view was that, if we were to hand over British Guianato Jewish sovereignty, there would be a great outcry.He (the Colonial SecretaryLthought that the first step would be to 4;4e%&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;--&apos; A^^ Commissionof Enquiry which had recently investigated the suitability of British Guiana for Jewish settlement.It was believed that the members of the commission were sceptical as to the practicability of large scale agricultural development in the colony.     TheCommission had, however, also considered thepossibility of industrial development in connection
with the forest areas of British Guiana.     Hethought that if the Commission favoured this typeof development, a course which was by no means certain, we should do all that we could to encourageit.     In this event the right course might he to divide the colony into two areas;    first, the coastal strip where the main hulk of the/inhabitantsand indLuotrioe were settled, and secondly territoryinland which might be made available, under thepresent colonial administration, to the Jews for development.     He anticipated that, from the outset, the Jewish community should be given thegreatest possible measure of self-government, andthat at a later date this part of the territorymight be handed.over to them in full sovereignty.It was clear, however, that no action could betaken pending the report of the Commission ofEnquiry.     He hoped that this might be received bythe week-end.THE HOME SECRETARY said that, while hehad an open mind on this matter, he thought that,on the face of it, the scheme for partitioningBritish Guiana and handing over part of the Colonyto the Jews was open to considerable criticism.
THE SECRETARY OR STATE FOR THE colonies said that this matter had, of course, only beendiscussed in a most informal and non-committalway.In reply to the Prime Minister, theColonial Secretary said that the tentative timetable which had been drawn up was as followsSaturday, 29th April,or Monday, 1st May.Afternoon, Monday,lat May.Afternoon, Tuesday,2nd May.Wednesday, 3rd May.A full draft ofGovernment decisions on policy to be sent tothe Egyptian PrimeMinister, and theGovernments of SaudiArabia and Iraq.Explanation of thedecisions to therepresentatives ofthe Press.Full text of the white paper to be communicatedto the representativesof the Jews and Arabs.Publication of theWhite Paper.Several Ministers suggested that itwas desirable that the proposals should again beconsidered by the Cabinet.
THE MINISTER &apos;0F HEALTH thought that further consideration by the Cabinet was desirable on this very important matter.     Hethought it was clear that opinion in the MoslemWorld was influenced by evidence of determination and by actions.     He instanced a recent telegramfrom Sir Miles Lampson, to the effect that publicopinion in Egypt had been influenced in f favour ofItaly by the Italian occupation of Albania.     he also thought that the policy about to be announcedcontained a number of concessions to a campaign of agitation and violence - concessions, moreover,which we should not have made but for thatcampaign.      Opinion in the East would not be slow to recognise this.     Further, he thought that weshould be pressed to make further concessions.In this connection he quoted a recent telegramfrom our Ambassador&quot; ia.v Cairo , which conveyedthe impression that we had now abandoned theidea of a Federal State.     He pointed out,however, that when&quot;we had agreed to delete the reference to a Federal solution from the white paper, we had at the same time stated that wemust be free to make clear our looint of view on a federal solution in the Parliamentary Debates.He thought that it was clear that the Arabsintended to press us further on this vital point.His own view was that it was only on Federallines that this problem, could ultimately be solved.
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRSfelt that every day that passed made it moredifficult for us to reach a settlement with egypt and the Arab Princes.     He was unwillingthat the matter should he postponed until thefollowing Wednesday (3rd May).After further discussion, it was agreedthat a special meeting of the Cabinet should beheld on Monday, 1st May at 11 a.m. to considerthe draft statement on policy circulated as c.P.79(39).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said thathe was hound to raise two points.The first was that in the view of theGeneral Staff our strategical interests werenot adequately safeguarded in the proposed white paper.     It was true that those interests were referred to in paragraph 10(l).     The view ofthe General Staff, however, was that those interests, which were of vital importance, oughtalso to he specifically mentioned inparagraphlO(S).He thought it should he made clear that we shouldhave the right for all time to keep as large forcesin Palestine as we required in our own interests.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF defence said that he had not failed to present the strategical issues to the Cabinet Committee on palestine.     The Committee had had before them aReport of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee(CP.7 (t^9))o He had also sent to the colonial secretary a letter, dated ISth April, enclosing anote on the strategical importance of Palestine,and on the safeguards which we should ensure in any future settlement in that country. He (Lord Chatfield)had more than once made it clear to the Cabinet Committee-18-
-1.9-that it was essential that our strategical requirements should he included in any permanent Treaty.     Thisview had been accepted by the Committee.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSconfirmed this statement.THE SECRETARY OF S TATE FOR THE colonies said that he had in mind a further amendment withthe object of including references to strategicalinterests in paragraph 10(6).The second point which THE SECRETARY OFSTATE FOR WAR raised concerned the question ofthe possible return of the Mufti to Palestine,the release of prisoners and the return ofdeportees. The Military Authorities held strongviews on this point which he would communicate to the Colonial Secretary.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE colonies said that he had been in communication with theauthorities in Palestine with regard to thisquestion and, in particular, with regard to thefurther treatment of the Mufti.      The action nowproposed in this matter was, he thought, in general.accord with the views put forward by General Hainingand the High Commissioner.It was agreed:-That a meeting of the cabinet should be held at 11 a.m. onMonday, 1st May, to consider thedraft statement on policy(CoP*79(59), when the points referred to in discussion shouldbe further considered.
THE GERMAN 7.      The Cabinet had before them a MemorandumAIRCRAFTINDUSTRY.      by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence(CP.  85 (39)) on the subject of the German(previous reference:   Aircraft Industry, covering a Memorandum preparedCabinet 53(38) Con- in collaboration between the Air Staff (intelligence)elusion 2.)and the Department of Overseas Trade (industrial intelligence Centre) and based upon information available up to the 1st February, 1939; togetherwith the relevant extract from the Draft Minutesof the 353rd Meeting of the Committee of ImperialDefence (Minute 4).After the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence had explained the main points in theMemorandum, a short discussion took place.The Cabinet took note of this Memorandum.
ADMINISTRATION 8. The Cabinet had under consideration aOP JUSTICE(EMERGENCY PRO- Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor (CP. 90 (39))VISIONS) BILL.circulating a draft Administration of Justice(Previous (Emergency Provisions) Bill, which had been preparedReference:Cabinet 39 in consultation with a representative Committee of(37), Con-elusion 18. )     Judges of the Supreme Court, together with the Lawf.r 2.k(-5t))io       Officers and a representative of the Law Society.The Bill contained such provisions as appeared tothe Lord Chancellor and the Home Secretary to benecessary to enable the Courts of Justice to function during a war.    After explaining the clauses of the draft Bill, the Memoranduminvited approval of the principle of the Bill and authority for its consideration by the Home AffairsCommittee on the understanding that it should beintroduced into Parliament and passed into law,if possible, in peace time, but should come intooperation only on the making of an Order inCouncil declaring that a State of Emergency existed.THE LORD CHANCELLOR,  in introducing theMemorandum, explained that the work of the Courtsinvolved very large numbers of people coming in to central London every day from outer London suburbs.For example, the attendance of large numbers ofpersons was required as witnesses or in othercapacities in the Courts.    The Departments under his control at the Law Courts included large staffs.He was satisfied that, in the conditions which were likely to prevail if London was heavily bombed,it would be impossible to carry on the administrationof justice in London,    It was also desirable that-SI-
certain Departments, such as the Office of the master in Lunacy and the Department of theOfficial Solicitor should he moved out of central london.Under the draft Bill, on the passinginto law of the Bill, he (the Lord Chancellor)would have power to take a number of steps whichwould result in distributing the Courts of Lawover the country.    Some of the more importantGourts would go to Oxford, which had the advantageof good law libraries.    Other Courts would go toother centres, e.g, the towns in which theAssizes were held.In order to allow time to get the new arrangements working, it would be necessaryto allow an interval of a fortnight during which time the staff would be given a holiday.The Lord Chancellor explained that hethought that ordinary litigation would fall offrapidly after the outbreak of war, but that therewould be much war litigation of a special character,e*g. under the Defence of the Realm Act.In reply to questions, he explained thatin war it would be necessary to retain juriesfor criminal cases, although perhaps the numbersof jurors empanelled might be reduced.    In civilcases jurors would be dispensed with.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR SCOTLANDsaid that a corresponding Bill for Scotland was atpresent being prepared.    He asked whether, if theprinciple of the English Bill were accepted, theScottish Bill might be submitted direct to theHome Affairs Committee without prior submission to the Cabinet, although such procedure wasexceptional., -pp-
Some reference was then made to the use ofthe term &quot;emergency&quot; in Clause 11 of the Bill.    TheLORD PRIVY SEAL pointed out that there was acorresponding Clause in the Civil Defence Bill inregard to the powers for requisitioning in circumstances similar to those on which it was contemplated the Lord Chancellor would require totake action.    It was agreed that the questionwhether the same language would he suitable in,both cases should be considered.The Cabinet agreed:-(l) To approve the principle of theAdministration of Justice(Emergency Provisions) Bill, andto authorise its considerationby the Home Affairs Committee onthe understanding that it shouldbe introduced into Parliament,and passed into law in peace-time,but should come into operationonly on the making of an Order inCouncil declaring that a State ofEmergency existed;(2) To authorise the submission ofthe corresponding Scottish Billdirect to the Home Affairs Committeewithout prior reference to theCabinet.
agricultural policy.PriceInsurancefor Sheep.(previous reference cabinet 59(38), Con-elusion 11).9.The Cabinet had before them the follow-ing Memoranda on the question of Price insurance for Sheep:-(l) by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries (CP.  88 (39)) stating thatthe Farmers&apos; Unions had asked for a guaranteed price of 1/- per lb.    TheMinister (and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland) supported a price insurancescheme based on an annual standard priceof lOd. per lb., which, in their view,would prevent sheep producers fromreducing their flocks through fear ofa recurrence of the heavy losses oflast year without causing undue burden on the Exchequer;(2) by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(CP.  92 (39)),  explaining the principles governing the determination of priceinsurance levels, and stating that inhis opinion a guaranteed price of 8-^d.would be reasonable.    The adoption ofa higher price would involve a policyof maintaining uneconomic agricultural production by means of permanentExchequer subsidies - a policy which itwas essential to avoid, whateverpolitical difficulties might have tobe faced.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE ANDFISHERIES explained to his colleagues that at a discussion of the Trade and Agriculture Committeeon the 14th March, the Committee had failed toreach a decision on the question of the standard price.    Subsequently, the Secretary of State forScotland and himself had seen the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer.    They had been able to reach anagreement on oats, but they had not been able toreach an agreement on the standard sheep prices.His view was that lOd. a lb. was the right figure,and that this figure was justified as anorthodox interpretation of price insurance.    Ifhe had been basing his proposal on costs of
production, he would have suggested a figureof l/- a lb.    The Chancellor of the exchequer had suggested 8-g-d. a lb.    This was less than theaverage annual price of 8^d. a lb. for 1938, ayear which involved the farmers in heavy losses.It was clear, therefore, that a figure of 8^d.would give no confidence.    In the years 1934-36,prices had averaged from lO^d.  to 10-g-d.    Theseprices had been insufficient to cause muchexpansion in sheep population.    Since thatdate, the general agriculture index, the minimumagriculture wage and the feeding stuff index hadall risen substantially.    Even the average priceof llfd.  in 1937 had not succeeded in bringing the sheep population up to the proposed &quot;ceiling&quot;of 27,000,000.    He was satisfied that lOd. wasthe minimum figure for the standard price, unlessthe sheep population was to be allowed to declinestill further.    This proposal had a bearing onthe land fertility scheme since, unless the landcould carry an adequate herd&apos;, of stock, theutility of the land fertility scheme would be largely destroyed.Continuing, the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries said that he was faced with the task of obtaining acceptance   of the proposals forbarley and oats.    Unless it was possible to givea fairly cheerful picture in regard to sheep pricesit would be difficult to obtain acceptance of theGovernments proposals as a whole.    He had also received a letter from the Chairman of the livestock Commission, who was apprehensive of afurther fall in beef prices.    If both beef and sheep prices were to drop, the effect on theGovernment&apos;s agricultural policy would be very serious-25-
THE SECRETARY OR STATE FOR SCOTLAND associatedhimself with the views of the Minister of Agricul-ture and Fisheriesv and emphasised the need fora speedy and early announcement in order to allayanxiety among the farmers in reg^ard to theGovernment&apos;s agricultural policyoTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER recapitulatedthe main points in his Memorandum.     He laid stress on the Report of the Departmental Committee on price Insurance, which was quoted in paragraph 10.He referred to the principles on which a priceinsurance level should be determined, and saidthat he did not see how the figures of the annual average prices in the last six years could possibly be held to justify a guaranteed price of lOd.     to promise as high a price as this would mean that farmers were to be guaranteed that they would neverreceive less than an average price, any deficitbelow that level being made good by the Exchequerand any excess going into the farmers&apos; pockets.To fix a guaranteed price of lOd. a lb. would hethought be altogether at variance with theprinciple applied in other cases,The Chancellor also mentioned the long-termtrend in the sheep population, in relation to theprices of the last six years, as indicating thata guaranteed price of 10do per lb  was too high,and was likely to lead to an increase in the sheep population,.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES,in reply, said that he was naturally unable toaccept the view chat sea increase in any form of
home agriculture production was to he deprecated.It did not follow that because lOd. a lb. was theaverage price of the last six years, that that price was a profitable price.    In the five years before 1932 the average price had been 1/- a lb.He did not believe that a figure of 10d. per lb.would afford any profit at all.     Any lower figure would result in a decrease in flocks, which he would regard as disastrous0THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that the Dominions recognised the right ofthe British farmer to first place in the home market.     They were, however, apprehensive of anyuneconomic expansion of agricultural products inthis country     If this happened, the result wouldbe an uneconomic expansion of industrial under-takings in the Dominions.     This was alreadyhappening in New Zealand.     Such a development was contrary to the best interests of this country andof the Dominions.     He could not pretend to saywhich was the right figure, but he was somewhatapprehensive lest a figure might be fixed whichwould result in an uneconomic increase in the sheep population of this country.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was clear thatthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofAgriculture had been unable to reach agreement, andhe doubted whether the Cabinet would feel competent to decide what the proper figure should be. he asked whether it would be an acceptable procedure
p 9that the two Ministers should refer the matter to him, and accept his decision.,     before reaching a decision he would consult with other ministers concerned, the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs and the President of the Boardof TradeoThis course was agreed to0THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE wished it tobe Pu&quot;k or- record that he was not prepared to subscribe to the views expressed by the variousrepresentatives on the Interdepartmental Committee,to which reference had been made in the Chancellorof the exchequers Memorandum.The Cabinet agreed -To invite the Prime Minister toreach a decision in regard to thedifference which had arisen betweenthe Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Minister of Agriculture andFisheries in the matter of thestandard price which should befixed, under the scheme of priceinsurance for sheepe
