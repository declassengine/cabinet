1. The Prime Minister pointed out that thenumber of documents now circulated to members ofthe Cabinet was assuming formidable proportions.Papers had been circulated during the present weekwithout his being consulted, which as a matter of fact he would have asked the Ministers concerned towithdraw.    In this connection he quoted the requesthe had made on January 27th, 1932, that his colleagues should make it a regular practice, before circulatingMemoranda&apos; to the Cabinet, to pass them through his hands (Cabinet 9 (.32), Conclusion 11),    The PrimeMinister added that he himself always took a lenient-view as to what should be circulated.   To illustrate the kind, of principles on which he acted, he suggestedthat it- was unnecessary for a Cabinet Minister to circulate a document merely to notify the Cabinetthat he agreed with the views of some colleague.On the other hand, a Memorandum setting forth theviews of a Government Department, containing essentialinformation and defining the point at issue, would always be of value.    His main point, however, wasto ask his colleagues to think twice before adding to the present number of Cabinet documents.In the course of a short discussion reference wasmade to Cabinet- Committee Papers, more especiallyin cases where the Prime Minister was Chairman of aCabinet Committee-, but no decision was taken.
2. In view of a Meeting arranged for the ministerial Committee on Disarmament the same evening, the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs thought it unnecessary to raise any question ofForeign Policy at the Cabinet.
INDUCTION and limitation of armaments.(previous reference:Cabinet IS(34), Con-elusion 1.)i33 .   The Cabinet took note of a Despatch from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador at Brussels (C.P.-91 (34)),circulated by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, containing the views of the Belgian Govern -ment on the British Memorandum on Disarmament.In view of the Meeting of the Ministerial Committeeon Disarmament, arranged for the same evening, thesubject was not discussed.
COMMERCIAL 4.  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byNEGOTIATIONSWITH FOREIGN the President of the Board of Trade (G.P.-88 (34))I COUNTRIES.Latvia,reporting the progress of the Anglo-Latviancommercial negotiations and asking the approval(Previous of his colleagues to the conclusion of an AgreementReference 1Cabinet 48 with Latvia on the lines indicated in the Memorandum.(33), Con-elusion 9.) An estimate made in the Board of Trade of thebenefits to United Kingdom trade which would result from such an Agreement was attached to the Memorandum.The Secretary of State for the Colonies saidthat he wished to raise one point connected withthe proposed. Agreement.The President of the Board of Trade Invited, himto make the communication to the parliamentary secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade assoon as possible, as the Agreement was nearing completion.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat the Foreign Office had one or two draftingpoints to raise, but these could be dealt withinter-Departmentally.The Cabinet approved the conclusionwith Latvia of a Trade Agreement onthe lines described by the Presidentof the Board of Trade in 0.P.-89 (34).
5. The Cabinet had before them a Note by theMinister of Labour (C .P*-90 (34)) covering a draftCotton Weaving Industry (Temporary Provisions) Bill,designed, to give effect to agreed rates of wages inthe Weaving Section of the Cotton Industry.   after explaining the main provisions of the Bill the Notepointed out that the Bill placed the minimum ofresponsibility for action on the Minister of Labourand. that he would in no way be responsible for thesettlement of the rates of wages to be enforced.The Prime &quot;Minister ashed, the Minister of Labour,if possible, to make it even more clear in the Billthan at present, that there was no intention of theGovernment intervening in negotiations &quot;between therepresentatives of employers and employed in theWeaving Section of the Cotton Industry, and. that the sole basis of the Bill was to ensure compliance with agreements freely entered into by the two parties.   He pointed out that once the Governmentintervened in negotiations the whole scheme would besmashed.The Minister of Labour undertook to look intothis point.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs pointed out that in the past the Government hadoften intervened to aid the settlement of disputes in the Cotton Trade.   If the present Bill was passedthey would be fettered in rendering good offices infuture disputes.   If they sent aq officer to assist in the settlement of disputes it would be contraryto the underlying basis of the Bill;    if they sentno&apos;officer there would often be no settlement.
The Minister of Labour pointed out that thealternative to the Bill was widespread trouble inthe industry.   He gave notice of one alteration he intended to make in the Bill,   As at present drawnit would last only twelve months.    It would be better to provide for some months&quot; notice of termination by either of the parties concerned.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked why, in clause 5, the fees of the three members of the Boardand any expenses Incurred by the Minister were to bepaid out of monies provided by Parliament.   Hesuggested that these costs should be borne by theindustry.The Minister of Labour undertook to look into thepoint.The question was raised as to whether the bill which provides compulsion to employers who do not carry out an agreement, contained, any correspondingprovisions applying to Trade Unions that broke anagreement by withholding labour.    The Cabinet were informed, that there was no such provision.A question was also raised as to whether the fineof  10, set forth in Clause 3 (?,) (b), applied to each person concerned, and the Cabinet were informedthat this was the intention.During the discussion the utmost stress was laid,on the importance of emphasising the fact that thiswas an experiment to deal with a particular emergency in a particular trade.The Cabinet agreed      &apos; - - -(a) To approve in principle the draftCotton Weaving Industry (temporaryProvis ions ) Bil 1 :(b) That the Bill should be brought before the Committee of Home Affairs:
(c) That the Minister of Labour shouldbe authorised, to announce that he proposed to get into communicationwith the representatives of employersand employed in the Cotton WeavingIndustry, and that if the result ofhis interview was satisfactory hewould introduce a Bill.    In making this announcement he should, armphasisethe experimental nature of the pro-posals, so as to make the point clear from the first.-7-
waterloo bridge.(previous reference:Cabinet 13(33), Con-conclusion 11.)6. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Transport (C.P.-86 (34)) on thesubject of Waterloo Bridge, in which he.gave an account of a visit from Mr Herbert Morrison.Notwithstanding that the opinion of the House ofCommons was adverse to the destruction of theexisting bridge, Mr Morris on had said that the newLondon County Council would take the same view asthe old Council and desire to demolish it, replacingit by a modern bridge adapted for six lines oftraffic.    He had urged the Minister of transport to give him informally some indication of theprobable attitude of the Government in the event ofthe Council inserting in their annual Money Billprovision for capital expenditure upon this subj-ect .In these circumstances the Minister recommended thathe should be axithorised, on behalf of the Government,,to inform Mr Morrison that while it was open to theCouncil to take any action which, in the exerciseof their discretion as the responsible highway and improvements.authority, they might think necessary or advisable, the Government would not be able tomake a grant to any scheme which ran contrary tothe expressed, opinion of Parliament, and would notbe prepared itself to take any steps with a view tourging Parliament to alter that opinion.The Minister of Transport reported that theonly new factor in the case since his memorandum was circulated was that Mr. Morrison, owing to pressure on his time, had not been to see him beforeobtaining an official resolution from the London       UCounty Council in support of the construction of anew bridge.      The resolution had been passed on theprevious day as the result of a division in the
London County Council almost entirely on party lines.The next stage would he the introduction in parliament on behalf of the London County Council of a Money Billcontaining details as to how the money would be spent.Provision would be made therein for a new bridge.If the London County Council were to provide their share(40 per cent,) of the cost out of the rates and not to borrow, they could demand 60 per cent,  from the Governmentand the Minister of Transport had powers to give itnotwithstanding the resolution of Parliament.      He himself had told Mr. Morrison that the Government would not givethe 60 per cent,  if it ran counter to any recentParliamentary resolution.      Tenders for the bridge wouldbe received in April and the London County CouncilBill would not come before Parliament until May.In the course of the discussion a suggestion wasmade that in his speech in the House of Commons theMinister of Transport might with advantage give a carefullyveiled hint that if traffic considerations alone werewould be desirable,discussion on the questionmainly in its political aspects, the Cabinet agreed:-(a)    To approve the communication to Mr. Morrisonproposed by the Minister of Transport in cp.  86 (-34) and summarised above.(b) That, in the debate in Parliament onthe Bill,  the Minister of Transport,while avoiding any impression that theGovernment wished the House of commons to change its mind, should repeat theadvice of his predecessor that from thepoint of view of purely traffic considera-tions a new bridge was preferable and thatthe decision was left to the House ofCommons.(c) That questions relating to the politicalmanagement of the Bill in Parliamentincluding matters such as speeches by and voting by Ministers should be discussed between the Prime Minister, the Ministerof Transport and the &quot;usual channels&quot;.involved some larger schemeAfter     considerable

He undertook to circulate the promisedMemorandum in the near future.
UNEMPLOYMENT.Special Areas.^Previous&quot;Reference:Cabinet 7  (34)Conclusion 12).iif in) i&apos;CtM.d14*    The Minister of Labour informed the Cabinet.that for some time he had had it in mind that hisMinistry ought to take steps to obtain closerknowledge of those special areas sometimes referredto as &quot;derelict&quot; areas as distinct from &quot;distressed&quot;areas, where the local industries had perished andthere was little prospect of providing employment for the inhabitants.      He had beentncouraged tofollow up this idea by a speech at Newcastle by theChancellor of the Exchequer from which he quoted.He thought, however, that it would not be right to await the setting up of the Unemployment assistance board before initiating these enquiries.      Some of theinformation required lay outside the scope of thatBoard and, in any event,  there must be a good deal of delay before the Board could get to work on thesubject.      First the Bill had to be passed and after that the Board had to be constituted and certainregulations drawn up, all of which would take time.He suggested,  therefore, in order to show these districts that they were not forgotten in london that some body comparable to (say)  the Transfer Board,should be set up to collect the information which would eventually be required by the Unemployment assistance board.      He gave an indication of the kind ofcomposition of the enquiry he had in mind as well as of the terms of reference.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed:-(a)    To approve in principle the idea of theMinister of Labour for instituting an enquiry into the special areas ofunemployment to which he had referred,but to suggest to him that the enquiry should be rather informal in character,and that he should make arrangements forinvestigations in four of the areasof the country (e.g. South Wales, South-East Coast, parts of Cumberland and partsof Lanarkshire) by perhaps two personsselected for each area.
(b)    That in making these arrangements,  theMinister of Labour should consult thePrime Minister and keep in touch withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, theMinister of Health and the Secretary ofState for Scotland, making arrangements with the two latter for appropriateco-operation by and information from local Authorities.2, Whitehall Gardens, S,W.1.,28th March, 1934.
