THE SECRETARY 1. The Prime Minister read a message he had justOP STATE FORTHE COLONIES,   received from Nairobi indicating that the illnessof the Secretary of State for the Colonies had taken a sudden and unexpected turn for the worse and asking that Lady Cunliffe-Lister should he requested to go out by the shortest route.The Cabinet expressed serious concern, and wereglad to learn that the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs had in hand arrangements to speedher journey and to ensure that the best medicalattendance and nursing skill were available.The Minister of Health offered any assistance that the experts in his Department could provide inthese matters,The Prime Minister said that on the previous evening, before receiving this information, he had sent a telegram of good wishes to the Secretary ofState for the Colonies, and would take any action that appeared appropriate and helpful.
Imperialdefencerolicy.potion forWednesday,February 7th.previous reference:Cabinet 621(33), Con-clusion 5. )2.    The attention of the Cabinet was called tothe following draft Motion down for February 7, 1934,on the subject of Imperial Defence:-&quot;Mr. Clarry, - To call attention tothe inadequate Defences of Great-Britain and the Empire from ForeignAttacks;    and to move,  -That this House, while appreciatingthe sincere efforts of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to secure world-widedisarmament, considers that the growing disparity in armaments ofthe United Kingdom in relation toother Powers has brought about a situation which seriously imperilsthe security and independence ofthe British Empire, and in conse--quence this House, though anxiousto promote a policy of peace and international disarmament, urgesHis Majesty&apos;s Government henceforthto pursue a course which willadequately safeguard our national life, trade, commerce and shipping from foreign aggression and therebyensure our existence as a sovereignpeople. &apos;&apos;The Cabinet agreed  That the question should be consideredby the Ministerial Committee on Disarmament.Note:-The following modified version of the abovemotion was subsequently issued in the Votes and proceedings of the House of Commons:-Notices given on Wednesday, 51st January, 1934.Mr.  Clarry, - Inadequate Defences of GreatBritain and the Empire from Foreign Attacks.- To call attention to the inadequateDefences of Great Britain and the Empire from foreign Attacks;    and to move,    That this house, while appreciating the sincere efforts of His Majesty&apos;s Government to secure world-wide disarmament, considers that the growingdisparity in armaments of the United kingdom in relation to other Powers has brought abouta situation whioh seriously imperils thesecurity and independence of the Britishcommonwealth and endangers peace;    in conse-quence,  this House, though anxious to co-operate in a universal policy of peace and disarment, either through the League ofNations or by direct international agreementsurges His Majesty&apos;s Government to pursue acourse which will adequately safeguard our industrial, political, and national existence
HOUSE OPLORDSREFORM.(previous reference:Cabinet 65(33), Con-clusion 11.)3. After ascertaining from the Leader of theHouse of Lords that Lord Salisbury&apos;s Bill on theTJouse of Lords would not come forward next week,the Prime Minister decided that the question neednot be considered until the next Meeting of theCabinet
AUSTRIA.Forms ofAssistanceto.(Pr evi previous reference:Cabinet 2(34), Con-clusion 1.)W.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs recalled that, at the Meeting of the Cabinet referredto in the margin,  certain suggestions had been madefor giving some indirect economic assistance to austria, but they had not been discussed in theabsence of the President of the Board of Trade.He - was still being pressed on the matter by Dr.Dollfuss and the Austrian Minister in London, andhe asked for a decision.    For one thing, he felt thatif Austria appealed to the League of Nations thesituation would be somewhat embarrassing, though hehad done nothing to discourage them from doing so.It might be that the assistance we could give wouldnot make much difference in the long run, but ifAustria should turn Nazi we ought to be in a positionto show that we had done all that was possible to avert it,    He recalled, in particular, the Chancellorof the Exchequer&apos;s suggestion that if Austria could make a favourable agreement with Poland or othercountries, we should not insist on our rights underthe most-favoured-nation clause in existing commercial treaties.    That, at least, would be a gesture of goodwill, and, he suspected, could not do us much harm.He had sent a communication to the Governments ofFrance and Italy asking what they felt able to do,and the tendency of their attitude had been to ask the same question of us, pointing out that they hadalready done what they could.   He gathered from thePresident of the Board of Trade that there was notariff concession that we could make.    He suggestedthat perhaps Canada might be willing to make some relaxation in the new Timber Agreement.The Cabinet were informed, however, that no concession in the matter of timber would be of any use
unless Austria was also given a preferential tariff,which could not he done without Canada&apos;s assent.The agreement with Canada had been reached withgreat difficulty, and had been accepted by Mr Bennettwith some reluctance.    It was doubtful if he could afford to make any concession to help Austriawithout asking for some further concession from usin return.   Moreover, Austrian timber was not of much use here, and the amount we could take would beso small as not to affect the question.The President of the Board of Trade said that,having been asked by the Austrian Minister to seeHerr schuller, the head   of the Commercial Departmerfcof the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whowas negotiating in Paris, he had for the third timeexamined the question of what could be done.   Theonly trade matter in which we could give help was invelour hats, which he mentioned to show how littlecould be done.    Our imports from Austria were downto a very low level.   The Austrian Minister was pressing him to see Herrsciuller, apparently not somuch in the expectation of achieving anything ueeful%but rather of showing that Austria could negotiate with a Great Power.   His own view was that it wouldprobably be better that Herr 3)huller should not come if the visit was to end in a failure.   The onlysuggestion of value that had been made was in thematter of the most-favoured-nation clause, referredto by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,   On that point he did not feel adamant, but it was a badmoment for making a concession, owing to our difficulties with France.   If a concession were allowed to Austria we should be charged with incon-sistency..
It was suggested that the question of whetherthe Austrians would derive some moral satisfactionand benefit from the visit of Herr Schuller (who wasunder no illusions as to the realities of the situa-tion) was really a matter for them to decide.      Ifwe decided to waive the application of our most-favoured-nation clause in the case of an Austro-PolishCommercial Agreement we should do it by agreement with france.The Chancellor of the Exchequer urged that weshould do anything we could.      We had a considerableamount of money in Austria.      Though he would not goso far as to say that this would be jeopardised ifthe Nazis came to power, he could not forget that the nazis had criticised these loans.      From a political point of view, however, he thought some actiondesirable.      Dr. Dollfuss&apos;s position was menaced owingto lack of economic support to Austria.      He had to admit that not much could be done.      It would be possible-for the President of the Board of Trade to reopenwith Mr. Bennett the question of some modificationof the Timber Agreement.      In that case, Mr. Bennettmight ask for compensation.      He thought,  on the whole,that the advantages would not balance the risks.He thought, however, that we should expressour willingness to waive our most-favoured-nationrights under any Treaty that Austria might makewith any other Power, and especially Poland.The fact that it would occasion for us difficulties with France wouldbe used to enhance the importanceof the concession in Austria&apos;s eyes.      As a matter of fact the British trade affected was of no importance.The over-riding consideration was that it would give
some rr.-.. .il help and set an example to Prance andItaly, who were in a position to do more, economically,than we could.   He hoped, therefore, that thePresident of the Board of Trade would allow this concession to he made, and that HerrSChuller wouldbe allowed to visit this country.The question was raised as to whether the conces-sions would be continued if Dr. Dollfuss should fall.In this connection the President of the Board ofTrade pointed out that it would be a serious matter to make our economic policy depend on what Party wasin office in a particular country in Central Europe.It was suggested, however, that this difficulty couldbe surmounted by limiting the period of any concessionwe might make.The President of the Board, of Trade recalled thatin the last Debate in Parliament on the subject ofAustria there had been rather strong feeling againstanything being done for her.The Cabinet were reminded, however, that that hadbeen a case of a loan, which was not now in question.It was suggested also that the German threat to austria had altered the whole situation.The President of the Board of Trade disliked doing what&quot; he felt sure was absolutely useless and likelyto complicate the situation, if only to a small extent.Nevertheless, he would not oppose the general opinion which appeared to exist in the Cabinet on the subject.The Prime Minister pointed, out that the proposaldid not amount to an offer to Austria that we ourselvesthought was particularly valuable, but that it wasthe Austrians themselves who asked for it.   We could say to Herr S&amp;uller &quot;We do not think this will be of very much use to you, but if you want it we are willing
to make the concession, and we hope that yon willmake the test of it&quot;.   He thanked the President ofthe Board of Trade for consenting to the course proposed.The Cabinet agreed  (a) that Herr Schuller should be encouraged to come to London:(b) That the President of the Board of trade should, be authorised to intimate that ifAustria could enter into a helpfulCommercial Agreement with Poland orother nciglxboitiiig countries, we shouldbe willing not to claim our- rights underthe most-favoured-nation clauses of treaties:    any such undertaking to befor a limited time.
REDUCTION and limitation of armaments,(previous reference:Cabinet 2(34), Con-elusion 2.)5. The Cabinet had before them the final version of the Memorandum on Disarmament (C.P.-10 (34)) as revised by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in accordance with the Cabinet Conclusion mentionedin the margin, and communicated to His Majesty&apos;representatives abroad.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that he proposed to publish the above document as a White Paper the same evening,so that it might appear in the newspapers on thefollowing morning.   Messages from Berlin, includingHerr Hitler&apos;s speech on the previous day, gave theimpression that the German Government recognisedthat we had made a great effort to understand their point of view,   He gathered, however, that questions would be raised very shortly about aeroplanes.S. Mussolini was eoing to make a statement in thecourse of the day, which would appear in tomorrow&apos;snewspapers,    S, Mussolini saw no objection to thetwo documents appearing simultaneously.   There was reason to suppose that the Italian document wasbeing re-cast and would now include an expression ofhope for some measure of disarmament,   News from paris indicated that the new Government was ratherweak in composition.    He felt it would be desirableto wait for a day or two in order to obtain more information as to foreign reaction to our documentbefore deciding on the next step.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the publication of theMemorandum in C.P.-10 (34):(b) That the question of the next step should be left for decision to -^he Prime Minister,^he Lord President of the Council^he Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs .
ANGLO-soviet negotiations(previous reference:Cabinet 2(54). Con-elusion 12).6.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe President of the Board of Trade (C.P..-26 (34))informing his colleagues of the progress of theAnglo-Soviet negotiations and indicating the lines on which he proposed a Trade Agreement should be concluded .After the President of the Board of trade had given explanations on some of the points coveredby the Agreement, the Cabinet agreed:-(a) That the President of the Board of trade should be authorised to conclude theAgreement:(b) To place on record their congratulations to the President of the Board of Trade,the Secretary of the Overseas trade department and their officialcollaborators on the success of their negotiations:(c) That the President of the Board of trade should consider whether he would take any action to invite a postponement of thediscussion in the House of Commons thesame afternoon.

The Presidentasked authority to make the announcement referredto in paragraph 10 (f) of CP.-279 (33).In the course of the discussion,  the Chancellorof the Exchequer pointed out that nothing was contained in the Bill to prevent the Government fromlevying excise duties on oil produced in the UnitedKingdom.      Nevertheless, he thought it would be aswell to mention at some appropriate stage that theGovernment possessed this right.The Prime Minister asked what would happen if the existing wells which are exempted from themain provisions of the proposed legislation were foundto be draining the oil off property at a distance.The President of the Board of Trade said thatin that event the licensing authorities beforeextending the area to which the licence applied wouldhave to get what evidence they could which, however,would not be easy.

point before the Bill was completed.The Secretary of State for War suggested thatit would be easier to get the Bill through the Houseof Lords if some reassurance were included thereinto owners that compensation would be paid for the compulsory acquisition of surface rights.This point met with some support, moreparticularly on the ground that oil wells with theirderricks and gushers and so forth would renderproperty in their vicinity uninhabitable.The Cabinet agreed(a)    That the question of compensationfor the compulsory acquisition of surface rights should be referred to aCabinet Committee composed as follows:-The President of the Board ofTrade&apos;(in the Chair),The Secretary of State for War,The Minister of Health,The Postmaster-General.(b) That at some point in the discussions on the Bill the President of the Boardof Trade should make clear that therewas nothing in the Bill to prevent theGovernment from levying excise on oilproduced in the United kingdom if parliament approved.(c) Subject to the above, to authorisethe President of the Board of Trade to circulate the Bill to the GovernmentDepartments concerned and to proceedwith the matter promptly.
