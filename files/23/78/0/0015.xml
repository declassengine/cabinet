HOUSE OP 1.   Arising out of an allegation by Mr WinstonCOMMONS.  Churchill, M.P., in the House of Commons the sameCommittee of^Privileges .     afternoon, which the Speaker had. rtiled should be&apos;i!S&quot;  x        referred for investigation by the Committee of Privi-leges, the Prime Minister brought before the cabinet as a matter of urgency a question relating to that committee, which consisted of the Prime Minister andten other members .Mr Churchill had visited the Prime Minister thesame afternoon and informed him that there would be atleast one absentee (Mr George lansbury), and perhaps two.He had suggested that, for consideration of so importanta matter, the House would, desire a full Committee, whichwould involve replacing the absentees.   Mr churchill had. further suggested that for the purpose of thisinvestigation additional members&apos;of great Parliamentaryexperience and unquestioned, impartiality ought to beadded, such as Mr Lloyd George, Sir Robert Home and captain Crookshank.   The Prime Minister had repliedthat the question of a substitute for Mr Lansbury andany other absentee might be considered, but the inclusionof additional members was another matter.   He had promised to consult and. to give Mr Churchill a reply at about 7 p.m.   He understood that the Speaker of theHouse of Commons had received Mr Churchill&apos;s proposalsrather favourably.    Prom such preliminary investigationsas he had had time to make, the Prime Minister gathered that, if additions were to be made to the Committeeother than the filling of vacancies    at any rate, itwould be necessary to discharge the existing Committeeand to appoint a new one.   The Committee appointed itsll own Chairman, who was usually, but not always, thePrime Minister.   The Leaders of Parties were included as members ,
In the discussion that followed it was pointedout that the constitutional position was that the Houseof Commons appointed, a Standing Committee of Memberstrusted by the whole House, which was intended to provide in advance a reliable and impartial body for the invest i-gation of any allegation of breach of privilege thatmight arise.   To add to its membership for the invest!-gation of some particular allegation, such as that madethe same afternoon, would be inconsistent, with theprinciple on which the Committee had been set up.This view was generally accepted.On the question of providing a substitute forabsentees there was general agreement that precedentshould, be followed, as closely as possible.    It was reported to the Cabinet during the Meeting, however,that no precedent had been found.   The Cabinet were informed that five members constituted a quorum andthat on one occasion the present Prime Minister hadbeen compelled by public business to absent himself from, the Committee without a substitute being provided.It was suggested that the provision for a quorum seemedto rule out the appointment of substitute members .This view, however, was not generally accepted, and itwas suggested, that those who had. originally nominatedthe absentee member (in this case the labour opposition party) might like to nominate a substitute.The Cabinet were informed that the allegation ofbreach of privilege concerned a member of the House ofLords besides a member of the Cabinet.   It was suggestedthat when opportunity arose to consult the regulationsit would probably be found that before responding to asummons to appear before a Committee of the house ofCommons a Peer would have to consult the House ofLords ,
The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Prime Minister should give nocountenance to Mr Churchill&apos;s suggestion for the appointment of additional members to the Committee of Privileges for thecase under consideration:(b) That there was no apparent objection tothe nomination of a substitute for anabsent member of the Committee, and thatthe matter should be left to the PrimeMinister, who was asked to followprecedent, if such could be found.-3-

The Chancellor of the Exchequer communicatedto the Cabinet full details of his financial proposalsfor the forthcoming Budget, which were approved by theCabinet,In view of the great importance of secrecy, thefinancial details, in accordance with precedent, arenot recorded in the Cabinet Minutes.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,April 16,  1934.
