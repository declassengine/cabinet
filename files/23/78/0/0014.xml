UNEMPLOYMENT .Special AreasLeakage ofInformation.(previous reference:Cabinet 13(34), Con-clusion 14.)FA1. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to information published in &quot;The Daily Express&quot; andsome other newspapers, which appeared to indicatesome leakage of the statement made by the Ministerof Labour at the Cabinet on the subject of SpecialAreas of Unemployment, as well as of the decis ionstaken by the Cabinet at the Meeting referred to inthe margin.   No explanation of these apparent leakageswas forthcoming.-1-
REDUCTION and limitation of armaments.(previous reference:Cabinet 13 (34)Conclusion 3.)2.    The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs drew attention to telegrams Nos.  16, 17 and 18 fromthe Lord Privy Seal (at Geneva) which he had already circulated.      He pointed out that the Lord privy seal had accomplished everything that had &quot;beensuggested to him by the Ministerial Committee, and thought that this should be a source of satisfaction to the Cabinet.This was generally agreed to.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsadded that the Lord Privy Seal, in his interview with Mr. Henderson on April 10th, had made it quite clear that the United Kingdom Government could not,as suggested by Mr. Henderson, undertake the revision of the Draft Convention.      &quot;The Times&quot;newspaper, in a despatch from Geneva, announced the exact opposite, namely, that the proposal had comefrom the Lord Privy Seal and had been rejected byMr. Henderson.       At the request of his colleagueshe undertook to draw the attention of &quot;The Times&quot;to this mistake through the usual channels.
GERMANY.He-armament of,(previous reference:Cabinet 12(54), Con-conclusion 1.)FA .3, The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs drew attention to the answer he had given in Parlia-ment to Mr Boothby&apos;s question on the increased Germanexpenditure on armaments .   The explanations which hadbeen furnished by the German Minister of ForeignAffairs provided an excuse for the naval and. airexpenditure which brought it within the terms of theTreaty of Versailles .    On the other hand, he hadfrankly admitted that the expenditure for the army was intended, to produce a short-service army, suchas would, result from a successful Disarmament convention-tion, which might not be achieved.The Secretary of State for War pointed, out thatthe Germans could say that in preparing their Budgetthey were not going to anticipate the failure of negotiations which had been carried on for some time.Such an explanation would provide them with a teehnic-ally satisfactory answer.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed.The question would arise, however, as to whetherGermany was claiming to make this transformationwithout regard to the reaching of an Arms agreement at alla   He had. already taken steps to ascertain the views of the French and Italian Governments onthe subject of the increase in the German Estimates,,and. he would have to make a further announcement onthe subject in the House of Commons before long.The Prime Minister asked, the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to advise the Cabinet before he made any further statement.   He anticipated, that inthe very near future the Cabinet would have to continue their consideration of the following connected group of questions:-
Disarmament:    on which, the Ministerial Committeewould probably furnish a Report,The Report of the Defence Requirements Committee(CP .-64 (34)),withThe Questionnaire submitted by the Prime Minister(CP.-70 (34) ) .The Memorandum by the Permanent Under-Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs(CP,-104 (34)) entitled &quot;TheFuture of Germany&quot;, circulatedby the Secretary of State.-3a-
INDIA. -proposed Legis-pardon to dealrfCh Communism..(previous reference :-Cabinet 4( 34)    C on-Clusion 22,)4,  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for India (CP .-98 (34))circulating for the information of his colleaguesa copy of correspondence which he had recently had with the Government of India on the subject of communist activity in India.   Although the situation was not of immediate gravity, there was generalagreement that    it might become so at any momentshould any particular ground for agitation presentitself.    In these circumstances the Government ofIndia had examined the question whether the powers.they possessed tinder the existing law were adequate to deal with it, and, after consultation with local governments, had reached the conclusion that theywere not.   The Government of India had thereforesubmitted for the approval of the Secretary of state draft Bill, the main provisions of which were summarised in his Memorandum.   He himself was inclined to agree with the Government of Indians plan to publish the Bill in order to test Indian opinion before theyfinally committed themselves to proceeding with it,but he was anxious to have the views of his colleaguesbefore sending any. definite instructions to theGovernment of India.The Secretary of State for India said that atfirst he had felt rather apprehensive lest theproposals of the Government of India went too farand that when responsible Governments had been setup in India they might, if carried into law, be usedhowever, he had come to the conclusion that theGovernment of India&apos;s proposal was acceptable, withthe exception that he inclined to the view that itwould be better not to publish the Bill until theParty Leaders in the Assembly had been consulted.On reconsideration,
The lease for the proposals was that the dominions had corresponding powers and in this country we hadpowers of a different kind.   At the present time themachinery for dealing with such matters in India wasvery antiquated and involved resort either to/Regula-tion^ of 18-5-6- or to a conspiracy trial, which had proved, most unsatisfactory.   He himself had proposedthat the Government of India should use their powersagainst terrorist organisations, but they did not want to adopt this course against communism, whichwas a different order of danger.    In fact, there was-a gap in the legal powers of the Government of India.He had also suggested that the matter might be dealtwith by legislation governing immigration and deportation-tion.   The reply of the Government of India was thatthey wanted, in addition, to be able to deal withcommunists among the people of India.   mhe recent increase in communism was due to the release/of theMeerut prisoners .    Only the previous day he had.received a telegram from the Governor of Bombayreporting serious communist agitation in thatPresidency, where the communists had obtained influence over the very weak trade unionist organisations, and asking for powers to deal with them.   There was evidence of the&apos;same kind, from other parts of India.At the present time there was a very reasonableAssembly in India, and the Government of India thoughtit a good opportunity to introduce this legislation.There was no proposal at present to certify thelegislation if it were not passed.   He emphasised that the special powers were restricted to the use of force and violence and could not be used for preventingpolitical and economic movements unaccompanied byviolent methods.   He admitted that there was a possi-bility that the proposals might leak out at the stage
of consultation with the Party Leaders in the Assembly, -but he had great confidence in the Home Memberrshandling of such questions.The President of the Board of Education supported the proposals, on the ground that the alternative methods open to the Government of India were sounsatisfactory.-  He thought that the Government ofIndia should have in mind the Secretary of Statefsview that it might be better not to publish the bill until the Party Leaders had been consulted.Some doubts were expressed as to whether the bill was not too drastic for dealing with some of themethods which the Government of India had reportedwere used by the communists, such as propaganda byspeeches, newspapers, articles, celebration of anni-versaries and &quot;days&quot; (C.P.-98 (34), page 4, para.3(5)(e)) .The Secretary of State for War, who had been consulted on the matter by the Secretary of State forIndia, pointed out that everything was governed bythe provision that the Governor-General or local governments are empowered to declare unlawrful an organisation &quot;which advocates or promotes or has as&quot;one of its objects the advocacy or promotion of any&quot;activities designed or calculated directly or indireet-&quot;ly to bring about by the use of force.or violence or&quot;threat of force or violence the overthrow of or any&quot;change in the existing industrial agrarian or economic&quot;structure or the overthrow of or any change in the&quot;existing form of government&quot; (0.P.-98 (34), Para.l(l).) He pointed out that the justification of the Billfor dealing with propaganda, and so forth, was thatcommunism did advocate the use of force.   Propaganda,for instance, would only be dealt with under the BillIf it was calculated to lead to the &quot;use of force or violence&quot;.
The Secretary of State for India said, he would inform the Government of India that this was the Cabinet*sinterpretation of the intention of the Bill.&quot;he Cabinet agreed -(a) To approve generally the proposals ofthe Secretary of State for India inC.P.-98 (34)&quot;, subject to the following(i) That the Secretary of State forIndia should suggest to theGovernment of India that it might-be better to withhold the Bill from,circulation until after consultationwith the Party Leaders in the Assembly,but should draw their attention tothe risk of the provisions of theBill leaking out (possibly withhostile intention) during thatconsultation:    and(ii) That he should emphasise that in accepting the proposals of theGovernment of India the CabinetTsinterpretation of the intention ofthe Bill was that it wotild only beused against the more innocent-forms of communist propaganda incases where these were likely to lead to &quot;the use of force orviolence&quot;.(b) That it was unnecessary for the Secretaryof State for India to bring the matterback to the Cabinet unless some new factor was introduced.
PALESTINE.(previous reference:... Cabinet IS11(34), Con-elusion 13.)37.(3*)?.5.     The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda by the Secretary of State for the Colonies,relating to Palestine:-CP.-2 (34), a Private and personal letter from the High Commissioner forPalestine, dated December IS, 1933,to the Secretary of State, which hadbeen taken note of at the Meetingheld on January 16th (Cabinet 1 (34),Conclusion 15):CP.-95 (34), containing a comprehensive review of the position in Palestine,circulated, in accordance with the promise made at the Meeting referredto in the margin.   Attached to thisMemorandum was a copy. of a ConfidentialLetter from the Prime Minister to dr. Weizmann, the President of theJewish Agency, dated February 13, 1931.The Secretaryof State for.the Colonies made astatement to supplement his Memorandum, CP. 95 (34).He paid a tribute to the helpful attitude ofMr. J.C MacDonald,  the League of Nations HighCommissioner of the organisation for the Jews coming from Germany, of which he gave a recent example.Referring to the Agricultural Boards in Palestinefrom which the Arab representatives had been withdrawnsome time ago, he mentioned that the Government had now set up a Harbour Board on which important membersboth of the Arabs and Jews in Palestine, with aleavening of Christians, had consented to serve.He mentioned that the Right Hon.  Sir   Herbert Samuelwas about to pay a visit to Palestine.      He reportedthat an arrangement had been reached in regard to the\7akf funds which had been aceepted by the Mufti, Thiswas important.      He paid a tribute to the helpfulattitude of the Treasury in this matter.      Illicitimmigration was still serieus.      Out of 400 touristsin recent months the Palestine police (who were doingadmirable work both on the executive and intelligenceside) had only been able to trace three.      It might
be necessary for the High Commissioner to cut downhis authorised quota of immigrants to compensate for illicit immigration.     He had receivedgreat assistance from the Chairman and Legal Chairmanof the Jewish Board of Deputies in London in thismatter.The Secretary of State for the Colonies thenturned to the questions on which he required adecision in paragraphs 8 to 11, continuing his statement on the lines of the Memorandum.After these matters had been dealt with asset forth in the Conclusions below,  the Secretary ofState for the Colonies raised the question of theLegislative Council.     At the end of the meeting he mentioned that he was working quietly to securethat in some way the Jews should be induced togive some employment to Arabs which was the only wayto get over the wide differences that existed betweenthe two peoples of Palestine.The Cabinet agreed:-(a)    To approve the following extractfrom paragraph 8 of the Memorandum:-&quot;The Government has always maintained and it is, I think, generally accepted,  that immigration must be governed by the absorptive capacityof the country.      In assessingabsorptive capacity,  the HighCommissioner must take a reasonablylong view.      Every Jew who entersPalestine enters it as his permanenthome;    and the High Commissionermust be reasonably satisfied that,in fixing limits of immigration,there is a reasonable prospect that palestine can permanently absorbthese men and their children.Moreover, he certainly cannotdisregard the normal increase of arab population, &quot;
(b) That as regards Arab unemployment, paragraph17 of the Prime Minister&apos;s letter of the13th February, 1931, should be interpreted as in paragraph 10 of CP.  95 (34):&apos;&apos;In all circumstances, and having regardto the terms of the Prime Minister&apos;s letter,Arab unemployment is a factor to whichthe High Commissioner must have regard;and he alone can be the judge of how far this unemployment has been or is likelyto be aggravated by Jewish immigration.&quot;(c) That in the matter of employment on publicworks, paragraph 16 of the Prime Minister&apos;sletter of the 13th February, 1931, should be interpreted as suggested in paragraph 11 of cp.  95 (34), namely:&quot;If there are both Jews and Arabsunemployed, and available and suitablefor the job, clearly the Jews areentitled to a fair proportion of the work.But if there are no Jews unemployed,  or if the Jewish unemployed are providedfor,  then it is surely unreasonable to saythat fresh Jewish immigrants must beadmitted to do work which&quot;the Arabunemployed can do,  thus leaving Arabunemployed to be kept on special reliefor relief works.&quot;(d) That in due course the Secretary of State forthe Colonies should produce proposals for setting up a Legislative Council in Palestine,and that he should report to the cabinet before taking action in the matter.
6. The Cabinet again had under consideration the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages(Scotland) Bill,  introduced in the House of commons by a Private Member and down for Report and third reading on Friday, April 20th.The Secretary of State for Scotland informed theCabinet that there was no objection to this Bill,which could, be allowed to proceed.

The only amendment of major importance had been the deletion of the provisiondealing with the death penalty for attempted murder,\
COMMERCIAL 11. The Cabinet took note, of a Memorandum by theNEGOTIATIONSWITH FOREIGN President of the Board of Trade (C.P.-97 (34)) divineCOUNTRIES.  an account of the commercial negotiations which hadFrance.been proceeding with the French Government.   Bifficul-(Previous ties had. been encountered, particularly relating to reference:. Cabinet 5 our inability to give any promise as to our silk and(34), C on-clusion 21.)    artificial silk duties, and the negotiations had beenf-fj. . suspended, although the position remained quite open.35(3^)3.In response to a request for information, thePresident of the Board of Trade said that the agrioul-tural side of the negotiations had been left entirely to the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.   He would always bear in mind the importance of the agricultural industry and the extent to which it was suffering from,hardships at the present time.
RUBBERRFSTRIC-TICNS.(previous reference:f Cabinet 9(34), Con-clusion 4.)ljB.The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of Rubber Restrictions:-A Memorandxan by the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs (C.P.-65(34)), of which note had been takenby the Cabinet at the Meeting referred,to in the margin:A Memorandum by the Secretary OfState for the Colonies (C.P.-102(34)), stating that he had now received from the Dutch government definite statement (attached as an annex to his Memorandum) of the way in which they proposed to operate the Rubber Restriction Scheme in theNetherlands East Indies,   The dutch government had accepted the Inter-national Scheme in the form agreed inthe recent negotiations.   The Secretaryof State proposed forthwith to informthe British Producers Committee of theDutch plan, and, if the British industry-endorsed it, to arrange with the otherGovernments concerned for signature andannouncement at the most convenient-moment .The Cabinet were reminded that when the matter had last been before them, at the Meeting on March14th referred, to in the margin, the prospects of achieving an Agreement had appeared somewhat remote.Satisfaction was expressed that M. Colijn had discovered,a way of making the Agreement effective in the. dutch east Indies.The principal point   raised in the diseiission onthese Memoranda was the attitude of the United Statesof America.    It was pointed out that the United. states would not be very easy to deal writh, as they weretreating the matter in rather an emotional mood andviewing the new proposals in the light of the earlierrubber restrictions, which had been much resented.If these proposals were carried through, however, weshould be treating the United States of America verymuch better than they had. treated, us in the matter ofcotton and copper.   For example, as pointed, out bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies, representationof consumers was provided for in the Scheme underconsideration   an advantage that had never been
sranted in the American control over cotton and copper.Moreover, the Americans, in the case of copper, had given a preferential price to American producers,but under the present Scheme nothing of the kind was contemplated.   There was general agreement that itwould be necessary to adopt a firm line towards theUnited States Government.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointedout that the American Ambassador had suggested to him that, as the Americans were the largest users of rubber, the United States Government ought to be consulted before agreement was reached.Discussion took place as to when would be thebest moment to make a communication to the UnitedStates Government.The Secretary of State for the Colonies reportedthat the further stages of the Scheme would be asfollows:-   first, the proposal would now be submittedto the Rubber Growers Committee:    second, the RubberGrowers Committee would sign their agreements request-ing the Governments to confirm the Agreement:   third,the Governments would sign the Agreement, which wouldthen be put into operation.   The United states Govern-ment were informed as to the general lines of theScheme, though they were not as yet aware of the Dutchproposals for implementing it.   He thought that theright moment to make a communication to the AmericanGovernment was between the second and third stages,but M, Colijn would first have to be informed.It was suggested that to make a communication atany earlier stage would start a wave of speculation,but the Secretary of State for the Colonies pointed, outthat there would probably be a certain amount of leakagewhen the matter came before the Rubber Growers Committee,which was a large body.
The Cabinet agreed; -(a) To approve the proposals of theSecretary of State for the colonies as set forth in CoP.-102 (34) and summarised above:(b) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should communicate with theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs when the stage had been reached tomake a communication to the UnitedStates Government, which wouldprobably be after the Scheme had.been approved by the Rubber GrowersCommittee.   He should, however, firstnotify M. Colijn.(c) That the President of the Board ofTrade should, prepare particulars asto the American control of cotton and copper, in comparison with theproposals now under consideration for the control of rubber, as partof the British case for any discus-sions with the United States Government.(d) To concur with the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies that special treatmentcould not be accorded to any particularfirm, such as was asked for by Dunlops.
THE BUDGET,13.The Cabinet agreed  (previous reference:Cabinet 68(33), Con-elus ion 6.)That a Special Meeting to considerthe Budget should be held on MONDAY,APRIL 16th, at 6 p.m.T in the PrimeMinister&apos;s Room at the Kotise ofC ommons.
LORD TYRRELL&apos;S 14,   The Cabinet approved a proposal by the retirement.Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that,in sending a cordial message to Lord Tyrrell on his retirementfrom the post of British Ambassador at Paris, heshould include some expression of His Majesty*sGovernment&quot;s appreciation of his services.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W,l,April 11, 1934.
