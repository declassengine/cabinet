THE CABINET. 1.      The Prime Minister on behalf of the Cabinetwelcomed the Postmaster-General who was present for the first time as a member, of the Cabinet.
!HE REDUCTION.ND LIMITATION!P ARMAMENTS.previous reference:Cabinet 70 (33)Conclusion 2.)2.      7/ith reference to the Conclusionsmentioned in the margin, the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs reported to t he Cabinet on the developments which had taken place in regard to thereduction and limitation of armaments since thelast meeting on the 20th December, 1933.There had been two matters of importance.In the first place, communications had taken place between the four great Powers, Great Britain, France,Germany and Italy.      The French note to Germany, whileconciliatory in form, showed little if any changein substance from the position which France had taken up in the autumn.      The German reply to the french would probably be despatched that day but it was not proposed to publish it.      Signor Mussolini, who was more likely to be acquainted with the nature of itscontents than anyone else, had recently indicated thatits general tenor would be unfavourable.      Inaccordance with the decision of the Cabinet certainenquiries had been addressed to Germany but up to thepresent no answer had been received and it seemed not improbable that the reply which Germany was sending to France would in fact be a reply both to the Frenchand the English enquiries.The Ministerial Committee on Disarmament hadattached very great importance to there being nopremature publication of the various proposals whichwere now passing between the four Powers.      This view had been communicated to Paris, Berlin and Rome and wehad received a reply from Rome to the effect that signor Mussolini did not contemplate any immediatepublication and that he seemed disposed to consult us
before taking any action in the direction of publication.The whole question was at present being debated in theFrench Chamber and His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Parishad impressed upon the French Government theimportance which we attached to the withholding of publication.      There was no reason to suppose thatthe German Government contemplated any premature disclosure of the communications in question.Secondly, the Ministerial Committee had agreed that it would be advantageous to have prepared a Manifesto setting out the British proposals in theirlatest form.      The document in question was to bedrawn up in such a way as might make it suitable for eventual publication, but it was. of course, to beheld in reserve until the moment arrived when, it mightbe desirable in the general interest to publish it.He, the Secretary of State, was at work on the draftdocument but it had not been possible to completeit in time to circulate it for the meeting of theCabinet that day.      He hoped,, however,  to be in aposition to circulate the draft document to the Cabineton the evening of Wednesday, January 17th, with a viewto its consideration at the next ordinary meeting ofthe Cabinet unless some unforeseen development made an earlier examination of its contents necessary.The Cabinet took note of the reportof the present position on thereduction and limitation of armamentsmade to them by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, and also that, aspromised, the Secretary of state proposed to circulate for early consideration a draft Manifestoembodying the British proposals intheir latest form.
3,   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinetthat on the previous evening the Permanent Under-secretary of State for India had told him of certainvery urgent and important proposals which had beensubmitted by the Government of India on the subjectof Terrorism in Bengal.   The Government of Indiaasked for approval of certain proposals of theGovernment of Bengal for strengthening the special legislation now in existence for dealing withterrorism.   Among the provisions of the proposed legislation the most important was a proposal thatthe Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1925 and act VI of 19 30 (both of which were at present on atemporary basis) should be made permanent.-   Theeffect of so doing would be to make permanent(l) the powers of preventive arrest of terroristsand their detention, or the restriction of theirmovements;    and (2) the trial of terrorist cases by special Commissioners.   As a supplementary measureit might also be necessary to make permanent Act viii of. 19 32, which was passed for a period of three years in April, 19 32, and which provided for the removalof terrorist prisoners outside the Province.Other very important provisions would enable the death sentence to be passed in certain arms cases.The offences for which the death sentence might be imposed under the Bill would be:-(1) Manufacture, sale or offer for saleof arms without licence.(2) Importation of arms without licence.(3)  &quot;Going armed&quot; without licence.(4) Possessing arms without licence.In all these cases &quot;arms&quot; isrestricted to pistols, revolversrifles or shot-guns. &apos;(5) Causing an explosion likely to endangerlife or property.-4-
1U $WicCiu ol(6) Attempting to-do so.(7) Makins or possessing explosivesunder&quot;suspicious circumstances .The Prime Minister added that on the previous evening he had been invited to give his approval,on behalf- of the Cabinet, to the proposals of theGovernment of India, but he had replied that thematter appeared to him to be one of such graveimportance that it should be considered by theCabinet before an ansver was given.   He had then been told that the Government of India ought toreceive the reply not later than January 18th, inorder to give the necessary time to enable thespecial legislation to be introdiieed in the BengalLegislature on January 21st,   As the Secretary ofState for War had been very mijch concerned with thesubject when it was before the Cabinet in September,19 33, he had asked Sir Pindlater Stewart to send to the Secretary of State for War a copy of thememorandum!! which he had handed to him.   He suggestedthat the best way of handling the matter would befor the Cabinet to appoint a small Committee, with power to take decisions.-a,-^It was pointed outthat if a reply must reach the Government of india by January 18th there would be very little time forthe Secretary of State to return to England, but itwas generally agreed that the question whether heshould return or not was one which should be leftto the Secretary of State.
In the course of the discussion the Cabinet were informed that the proposal to exact the death penalty for offences under the Arms Act was meant to be a deterrent, and that it was improbable thatsentences of death would be passed save in very exceptional circumstances.   The Government of Bengalconsidered that the Bill would have a fair chance ofsuccess in the Bengal Legislative Council, but thatif it was not passed, or if vital amendments wereinserted (e.g., a time limit once more imposed)the Government of India considered that it wouldhave to be certified.   But they would not consideromission of the death penalty for offences under the arms Act as justifying certification.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That a Committee composed ofThe Lord Chancellor,The Secretary of State for War,The President of the Board ofEducation -should be invited to confer forthwithwith the Permanent Under-Secretary ofState for India on the proposals ofthe Government of India for special legislation against terrorism in bengal, and that, in view.of the short time available, the Committeeshould be authorised to reach final decisions on the matter without further reference to the Cabinet:(b) That the Secretary of State for india should be informed at once of theaction taken by the Cabinet, and thatit should be left to him to decide whether, in all the circumstances, itwas necessary for him to return toEngland before any reply to theGovernment of India was despatched.
4. The Cabinet again had before them theMemorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs  (CP.-297 (33)) containing an account ofa conversation he had had with Sir John Cadman onthe subject of relations with Persia, furtherconsideration of which had been adjourned at theMeeting referred to in the margin.General agreement was expressed with the viewthat it would be undesirable to attempt to dealwith this question in the absence of the Secretaryof State for India.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that the Foreign Office was quite ready for a discussion with the Persianauthorities of the various questions to be coveredby the contemplated new Treaty, and that on thewhole it seemed probable that an improvement in ourrelations with Persia might be anticipated, particu-larly as the Shah had lately given evidence of amore friendly disposition.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the question of our relationswith Persia should be examined assoon as possible by the Middle East(Ministerial) Committee, whichshould meet for the purpose not later than Monday, January 22nd,with a view to a Report being submitted to the Cabinet for con-sideration at their Meetine onWednesday, January 24th:(b) That, in the absence of the Secretaryof State for the Colonies, theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs should act as the Chairmanof the Middle East (Ministerial)Committee.
5, The Cabinet were informed by the Presidentof the Board of Trade that he hoped in the nearfuture to be in a position to circulate to theCabinet a very important Memorandum on the subjectof Coal Policy, but that before doing so he wouldlike to confer informally with the Prime Minister,and with the Minister of Labour, who was very much concerned with certain of the proposals.The Cabinet took note -(a) That the President of the Board ofTrade proposed to circulate a Memo-randum on Coal Policy:    and(b) That before the Memorandum inquestion was circulated, an informal conference would beheld at No. 10, Downing Street,between the Prime Minister, thePresident of the Board, of Trade,the Minister of Labour, the Secretaryfor Mines, and the Chairman of theCoal Mines Re-organisation Commission.
THE IRISH FREESTATE AND OTHERDOMINIONS.Immigration.UnemploymentBenefit andPublic Assist-ance.(previous reference:Cabinet 61(33), Con-clusion 5(b) .)FR s  6. ^he Cabinet had before them a Joint Memo-randum by the Home Secretary, the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs, the Secretary of Statefor Scotland, the Minister of Health and theMinister of Labour (C.P.-5 (34)), prepared in response to the request of the Cabinet at theMeeting referred to in the margin, in whichstatistics were given of immigration from the IrishFree State and other Dominions,   The Memorandumstated that no data were available in England onwhich to frame an accurate estimate of the numberof Free State-born persons in receipt of Unemploy-ment Benefit or Public Assistance,    In Scotland,however, there were nearly 14,000 Irish-bornrate-aided persons, of whom about 6,200 were born in the Irish Free State,   The Memorandum also gave particulars of Irish-born convicted prisoners andpauper lunatic? in Scotland, and of the law in theUnited Kingdom and the Dominions as to admission and deportation.The Cabinet were reminded that the memorandum had been circulated for their information, and thatthe question of what action (if any) should betaken must depend on the way in which the situationin the Irish Free State developed.   Drastic actionin the direction of deporting undesirable persons of Irish Free State origin would require legislation,which would be hotly resented in the Irish Free State,and our policy had hitherto been to abstain from giving Mr de Valera&apos;s Government any excuse forresorting to extreme measures, such as the declarationof a republic ,In this connection the attention of the cabinet was drawn to a recent speech by Mr Aitken, an IrishFree State Minister, which showed clearly that the
policy of Mr de Valera&apos;s Government was directed towards the establishment of a de factq republic .The Cabinet were reminded of the very strong feelings which were excited in some parts of thecountry, particularly in the West of Scotland, by thepresonoe  of a large and growing Irish-born element,many of whom were destitute or unsatisfactory inother respects.   Moreover, the existence of this element gave rise to controversial questions relating to religious education, mixed marriages,etc., in regard to which the Government sooner or later would be forced to declare their policy, inview of the likelihood of the introduction inParliament; by Private Members, of legislation.In these conditions it was urged that the question should not be shelved, as circumstances might wellarise in which the Government would be forced totake powers, similar to those possessed by theDominions, of deporting to the Irish Free State,undess irable persons of Irish Free State origin,even if the Government of the Irish Free State didnot go so far as to declare a Republic.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To take note of the Memorandum(CP.-5 (34)) on Immigration fromthe Irish Free State and otherDominions, which had been circu-lated for their information:(b) That special aspects of the problemsuch as those which had been referredto xn the discussion, should   ifthought desirable, be brought before   &apos;the Cabinet in the form of Memoranda    -circulated by the Secretary of Statefor Scotland, the Minister of Health,   .the Home Secretary, the Minister of *Labour,   or  other Ministers concerned.
ROYAL COMMIS- 7&apos;     The Cabinet had before them the Report of theLOTTERIES AND Cabinet Committee (C.P.-1 (34)) set up at theBEATING. Meeting referred to in the margin to study the final report. Report of the Royal Commission on Lotteries andReport of Betting (C.P.-179 (3?)) and to make recommendations.mittS?onT&quot;        At the end ^ their RePort the Catinet Committeesubmitted the following recommendations, on which a(Previous .    .   . j-^j.Reference: Cabinet decision was required.-(!^neronI (D ^he law relating to lotteries, bettingelusion 8 ) and gaming is out of harmony with modern conditions and requires amendment.As pointed out in paragraph 3 of thisCri-i.\\if Report, two alternative courses arepv&quot;^&apos; open to the Cabinet, and it is for theCabinet to decide whether the proposed legislation should -(a) deal with the whole subject oflotteries, betting and gaming ona comprehensive basis, or(b) be restricted to the regulation ofbetting on greyhound tracks (includingthe use of the totalisator on thesetracks) and the measures to be takento deal with the sale in this country of tickets in large-scale lotteriesand particularly in the Irish sweep-stakes .(2)  If it is decided to proceed on the com-prehensive lines of (l)(a) above, werecommend the adoption of the various proposals contained in the sections ofthis Report headed (A) On-the-CourseBetting.  (B) Off-the-Course Betting, and(C) Lotteries and Competitions, andAppendices I, II and III respectively.(3) If it is decided to proceed on the more limited lines of (l)&apos;b) above, we recommendthat the provisions of the Bill should be confined to our proposals regardinglotteries (including competitions),&apos; bettingon-the-course (including the regulationof totalisator betting on greyhound tracks),and certain amendments of the racecourse betting Act, 1928, relating to the opera-tions of the Racecourse Betting control board,(4) In either case Cabinet authority is requested for the preparation of a draftBxll, embodying the Cabinet decisions,with a view to submission to the Cabinetin due c ours e.
The Cabinet were reminded by the Home secretary that the questions dealt with in the Report raisedproblems of very great difficulty and controversy.The main reasons for the appointment of the RoyalCommission had been the difficulties in connection withgreyhound racing and, in particular, the use of theTotalisator on greyhound tracks and the scandalsin connection with large lotteries.      whatever policy was decided upon there would be differences of opinion and it seemed impossible for the Government to escapecriticism on some of the questions upon which theRoyal Commission had reported.From the point of view of administration therewere considerable advantages in having a comprehensivemeasure covering all the topics dealt with in the Report.On the other hand, it must be recognised that publicopinion expected the Government to deal with theTotalisator on greyhound tracks and large lotteries.A comprehensive measure would deal with on and off-the-course betting, with betting inducements, with theamendment of the Racecourse Betting Act, 1928, withlotteries and competitions and with gaming.      On theother hand, a limited measure v^ould deal with on-the-course betting, with the amendment of the racecourse betting Act, 1928, and with lotteries.      Apart fromother considerations, it would seem that the small amount of Parliamentary time available was a factor in favour of the more limited proposal.In the course of discussion, reference was madeto the fact that legislation on this subject had been promised in the King&apos;s Speech, to the impossibility of getting any comprehensive measure through Parliamentthis session, and to the unlikelihood of time being-12-
available for legislation on the subject in the 1935session.      It was urged that the proposals containedin the Cabinet Committee&apos;s Report should be dividedand that those concerned with on-the-course betting,lotteries and the Raoecourse Betting Control board should be embodied in immediate legislation, whilethe remaining proposals should be left for future legislation if and when opportunities presentedthemselves.The Cabinet were informed that Non-Conformistopinion in England and Wales would favour a Bill on themost comprehensive lines possible,After considerable discussion, the cabinet agreed -(l)    To request the Home Secretary to arrangefor the preparation of a Bill restricted to the regulation of betting on greyhoundtracks (including the use of theTotalisator on these tracks);    the measuresto be taken to deal with the sale in thiscountry of tickets in large-scale lotteriesand particularly in the Irish sweepstake;and to certain amendments of the racecourse betting Act, 1928, relating to theoperations of the Racecourse Betting control board.(2)    That the Bill should be drafted and circulated to the Cabinet for consideration as soon as possible and that it should be accompanied by a Memorandum indicatingwhich of the various proposals containedin the Committee&apos;s Report (paper CP.  1 (34))were not covered by the draft Bill.(3)    To request the Minister of Health andthe Secretary of State for Scotland to confer with the Home Secretary in regard to theproposals for the licensing by LooalAuthorities of courses for betting underthe section of the Report dealing with the regulation of on-the-course betting

The Cabinet agreed -To take note of the recommendations contained in the first Report of theCommittee on Scientific Research of theEconomic Advisory Council (CP.  309 (33))hut to take no action on those recommendations.Note.The Prime Minister instructed the deputy secretary to invite the Treasury to submit their views on the recommendations to thePrime Minister in accordance with the usualprocedure in the case of reports of theEconomic Advisory Council.

ROAD TRAFFIC.   10-      The Cabinet had &quot;before them a Memorandum by theRoad&quot;ASci-        Minister of Transport (CP. 312 (33)) to which wasdentS* attached a preliminary Report on Fatal Road Accidents^Reflrence: occurring in the six months ended 50th June, 1933.Cabinet 70(33), Con- The Minister asked authority for the preparation of aelusion 1-.) ^^^^ which would contain the following provisions:-f,R, (1) Re-imposition of a general speed limitfl(3ij)/, for private motor cars and motor cycles(30 miles an hour?) in built-up areas.(2) (a)   Licensing authorities under the road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, to beempowered to license and test all newdrivers of heavy goods vehicles (over2^ tons).(b) Drivers of other mechanically-propelled vehicles who apply for a licence for thefirst time to be made subject to a prescribed test, the test to be applied by, and a certificate obtained from,authorised organisations such as theAutomobile Association and the RoyalAutomobile Club on payment of a prescribed fee,(c) The Courts to be empowered to require any person now holding a driving licencewho may be convicted of careless or dangerous driving to be prohibited fromdriving again even after his period of suspension is fulfilled except on production of a certificate showing thathe has passed such a test.(3) Permitting regulations to be madeprohibiting the sounding of motor hornsbetween specified hours, and applicableto defined areas.(4) All convictions for careless or dangerous driving or for exceeding a speed limit to be endorsed on thedriver&apos;s licence.    A short period of suspension to be permissible for a firstoffence of careless driving.(5) Power^to introduce a system of &quot;passagescloutes&quot;,-   (6) Power to prohibit the sale of inefficientreflectors and to require the rearmudguards of pedal cycles to be paintedwhite.In addition he proposed certain administrative measures as regards speed indicators and propaganda which were within his existing powers.
Some discussion took place on the proposal tore-impose a general speed-limit for private motorcars and motor cycles (30 miles an hour) in built-built-up areas, in the course of which the Cabinet were informed that in the opinion of the Police Authori-ties the only effective way o^ ensuring observance of the speed-limit was by means of an extensive useof the Police Motor Patrol system, which would, ofcourse, involve increased cost.   Doubts were also expressed as to \*-hether the proposed definition o* a&quot;built-up area&quot; was satisfactory, having regard tothe fact that in Durham and other parts of thecountry it was the practice to instal street lampson the highroads in rural areas .Attention was also drawn to the failure on thepart of many Benches of Magistrates to inflictadequate penalties for motoring offences .    ^heobjections to interference by the Executive withthe powers of Magistrates in this respect were,however, emphasised, and doubts were expressedwhether any action beyond that taken by the HomeSecretary in the form of the issue of an AdvisoryCircular was desirable.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed  To authorise the Minister of Transport-to arrange for the preparation of aBill to deal with road accidents, theBill to contain the provisions set outin the conclusion on page 6 of his memorandum (C.P.-312 (33)) and rep]duced above in this Conclusion:subject, in the case of (l) to further examination of the question of the definition of a &quot;built-up area&quot;, andr** *0 JHe draft Bill being circulatedto the Cabinet for consideration beforen Te^red in        ordinary way to&quot;the Committee of Rome Affairs.&quot;epro-
ROAD ACCIDENTS *       11. In the course of the discussion mentionedWeak Bridges,      in the preceding Conclusion the President of theetC* Board of Education drew attention to the policy ofthe Ministry of transport in regard to replacement of narrow hump-backed bridges       often of greatarchaeological and artistic interest - by modemconcrete structures, and the practice of doing away with bends and corners in highroads, which had theeffect not only of lessening the artistic amenities of the countryside but rendered the roads themselvesmore dangerous by encouraging speed.   He wished to protest most emphatically against the philosophyunderlying references to these matters in theMinister of Trans port&apos;s Memorandum.The Prime Minister sympathised with thePresident of the Board of Education, particularlyin regard to the straightening out of corners, andalso drew attention to the drastic way in whichtiroesfine old trees were some/ sacrificed unnecessarilyin the course of road construction operations.The Minister of Transport pointed out, withregard to weak bridges, that the reason for theirreconstruction was generally that they were notstrong enough to bear the traffic which they were called upon to carry.    In regard to the general question he assured the Cabinet that due regardwas always paid to aesthetic considerations in approving road and bridge schemes,    in the last resort the views of the Ministry of Transport couldbe made to prevail by the threat of stopping grantson a particular scheme.
ROAD- TRAFFIC.Third PartyRisks.The road traffic(Com-pensation forAcci dents)Bill.The road traffic(EmergencyTreatment)Bill.(previous reference:Sahinet 70(33),Con-clusion 12. )12.    The Cabinet had under consideration a further memorandum by the Minister of Transport (0.P.4(34))dealing with the following subjects:-(1)   Compulsory Insurance against Third PartyRisks in respect of Death   or personal injury.(2)   Road Traffic (Compensation for Accidents)Bill.(3) Road Traffic (Emergency Treatment) Bill.The Minister stated that there were certain casesof hardship in which claims by injured parties incases of death or personal injury resulting from a road accident could not be enforced against insurance companies under the existing law relating to compulsory insurance against third party risks.      he proposed to consult representatives of the insuranceinterests, and sought authority to approach them onthe basis that the Government desired to see certain amendments made in the law, as set out on page 5of the Memorandum.The Memorandum referred also to the two Billsmentioned above which had been introduced privatelyin     the House of Lords.      The Minister recommendedthat, whilst the passing of the Road Traffic(Compensation for Accidents) Bill would not be expedient in present circumstances,  it would be advisable to incorporate the proposals contained inthe Road Traffic (Emergency Treatment) BiJLl in thelegislation for the amendment of the Road traffic act for which he was now asking approval.
The Minister of Transport informed the Cabinetthat before taking action on the proposals in his memorandum (CP.-4 (34)) he desired to hear thegeneral views of the Cabinet on them.With regard to (a) on page 5, namely, that theright of action shall not abate on the death of the insured, the Cabinet were reminded that the general question was one of the matters which had been referred by the lord Chancellor to a Committee.The question was one of general application andshould be dealt with generally:    it would be quiteillogical to provide specially for the case of motoraccidents if the law remained unchanged in regard toother fatal accidents *The lord Chancellor informed the Cabinet that he hoped to receive a Report on this subject from his committee in a few weeks&apos; time and that it would bepossible to prepare and pass through Parliament ashort Bill dealing with the general question beforethe Easter Recess.The Cabinet agreed that it would be undesirable to attempt to deal specially with this question fromthe point of view of motor accidents, and that this aspect of the matter should be referred to the LordChancellor^ Committee, who should be invited to expedite their examination of the general question with a view to the early submission of their recom-mendations.The Cabinet approved the proposal of the Ministerof Transport that he should discuss the provisionsVb), (e),  (d) and (e), on page 5 of his Memorandum,with the Insurance Companies, on the understandingin the case of both (b) and (c) that the misrepresentations-tion or non-disclosure must be of a technical and not-21-
