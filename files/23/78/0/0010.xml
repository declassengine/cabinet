imperial[defencetPOLIVY.report of!Defence Re-fqui.rerr.ent sfCommittee.(previous reference:Cabinet 9(34), C on-clusion IS.)Relationswith. JapanFAProposedPact of non-Aggression *3. The Cabinet resumed their general discussionof the Most Secret Report of the Defence requirements committee &apos;C .P.-64 (34)), dealing, with a programme for meeting our worst deficiencies in ImperialDefence, and the Note by the Prime Minister (CP.-70(34)) covering a series of questions.In addition to the above the Cabinet had beforethem, the following. Papers:-A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs (C.P.-78(34)) circulating in connection withQuestion 25 in CP.-70 (34) an historical note, prepared in theDominions Office, on the Attitudeof the Dominions in regard to theTermination in 1921 of&quot;the Anglo-Japanese Alliance:A Memorandum, by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (CP.-80(34)) setting forth the pros andcons of an Anglo-Japanese non-aggression pact, which had beensuggested during the discussion at&quot;the previous MeetingIA Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (CP.-68 (34)) onthe Consequences of a Breakdown of. theDisarmament Conference, which, asdecided, at the previous Meeting(c ab in et 9 (34), 0 one lus i on 3),was to be brought up at the appro-priate stage of the discussion on imperial Defence Policy.The Cabinet turned first to Question 2 of the questionnaire that had been before them at the last meeting (C,P.-70 (34)), namely. Relations with Japan.The Prime Minister first raised the question of whether, after the discussion at the previous meeting, the Cabinet wished further to considerthe proposed non-aggress ion pact with. Japan:   andafter a short exchange of views it was decided thatthe proposal ought, to receive further consideration.The President of the Hoard of Trade had not beenable to attend the Meeting on this question, andconsequently there had. been no discussion on theeconomic aspects of the proposals then made for-a-
getting back to our old terms of cordiality and mutualrespect with Japan.In the course of the discussion attention was drawntea volume of Memoranda on many aspects of the situa-tion in the Par East, which had been circulated bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C.P.-77 (34))and a study of which several members of the Cabinetsuggested was essential to the question of Relationswith Japan.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat he had circulated these Memoranda rather forgeneral information than in connection with the Reportof the Defence Requirements Committee, but he did not dissent from the view that some of the Memoranda hadan important bearing on the question under considera-tion.The Prime Minister drew attention to the verycompendious nature of these Memoranda and asked, whethera precis could be eirculated .-The President of the Board of trade pointed outthat some of these documents did not lend themselvesto a precis :    for example. Memorandum Mo.4, on theeconomic position in Japan.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thoughta precis would be difficult, but undertook to make an attempt .The President of the Board of Trade undertook to circulate a Memorandum on the economic aspects of theproposals before the Cabinet.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs pointed out that no agreement with Japan could be signed on behalf of the Dominions, who would be ratherdivided.    Australia and New Zealand, for example,would be favourable to an agreement, and Canada wouldbe opposed.
The Cabinet agreed  (a) To postpone further consideration   of questions 2 and 3 of C.P.-70 (34)&apos; until a later Meeting, to give time for the study of C.P.-7? (34) and for the pre-paration of the further documentsmentioned below:(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should,  if possible,  circulate a precis of CP.-77 (34):(c) That the President of the Board of trade should, circulate a Memorandum on theeconomic aspects of the proposals beforethe Cabinet for closer relations with japan.
; IMPERIALfpopicy.Report ofDefence Re-qidrementsCommittee.Europe.3.   The Cabinet then turned to the 4th question in the Prime Minister&apos;s questionnaire (CP.-70 (34))viz.,&quot;Does the Cabinet approve the following:-&apos;Secondly we take Germany as theultimate potential enemy against whom our &apos;long-rangeDefencepolicy must be directed&quot;? (Para.12 of CP.-64 (34) )and the consequence (set forth in theSecond Assumption of the Report) that france, Italy and the United Statesof America should be excluded, from our basis of calculation, and. the remarks thereon in paragraph 13 of cp.-64 (34)&quot;.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs suggested, that the last words &quot;and. the remarks thereonin paragraph 13&quot; should be amended to read &quot;subjectto the remarks thereon in paragraph 13&quot;.The Prime Minister said he had intended this, thepoint being that, he had wished to draw attention to paragraphs IB and 13 in their relations to each other,which latter provided for a. y slightly extended interpretation of the assumption .that no expenditure was to be incurred on measuresof defence required to provide exclusively against attack by the United States of America, France orItaly .The Secretary of State for India suggested thata good deal turned on what was meant by the term&quot;the ultimate potential enemy&quot;.   The D.R.C. Reportappeared to suggest Germany as an immediate menace.From the documents circulated from time to time tothe Cabinet he doubted, whether the German menace was quite so acute as the Report appeared to assume.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat from the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s reports and other documents it was a fair inference that Hitler&apos;soutlook was not aggressive or threatening to us,
fcut that Hitler was preoccupied with the internal situation in Germany and. the development of her placein the world.   Moreover, the methods adopted byHitler and his friends were often menacing.   Hitlermaintained that the Nazis were not a military force.It might be that his intention was only further todiscipline an over-disciplined people:    but the fact remained that he had two and a half million peopleenrolled in these forces.   Moreover, his methods ofappealing to his own people might easily result in amenacing situation.   He thought, therefore, that theprobable intention of the document was not to indicatethat Germany was threatening us today, but that hermethods tended in a menacing direction.   For example,Germany was tearing up the Treaty of Versailles.The Committee probably assumed., - therefore, that danger was more likely to come from Germany than from anyother direction.   He himself inclined to the viewthat a German menace, if it developed, was more likelyto be to the east and south than to the west.   AustriaDanzig, Memel, appeared to be principally menaced.Although it had hitherto been assumed that germany could not do anything effective against her neighboursshe was rapidly increasing her force.The Secretary of State for India said that ifthe menace was as great as was suggested in thisReport the Cabinet were faced, with a very critical situation, comparable to that which existed, in 1906to 1914;.&apos;  That involved wider issues than could be faced, by an inter-Departmental Committee.   It wouldinvolve a series of Inquiries of a type that had occurred between the years mentioned, to which itmight be necessary, as then, to invite the Parlia-mentary Opposition.   When such great sums were
involved as the Report suggested, it would be absurdto try and reach decisions without relation to Prance,and we might have to be drawn into discussions with france.    He thought that before going into technical idetails these issues of broad, policy ought to beconsidered.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed with theSecretary of State for India that it would be wrong togo into ,this question without envisaging the possibilitof allies, as in that event the commitments might wellbe larger than we could face.   When confronted withan expenditure of over  70,000,000 in five years the Cabinet were bound to consider whether there wasno alternative.    Surely the whole lesson to be derivedfrom the disarmament discussions was that disarmamentcame second, and. security first.    If we could onlyget security by material guarantees it might be foundthat our share of some general scheme came to lessthan the figures suggested in this Report.   He thought,therefore,  that the Cabinet ought to go to a pointeven further back than that at which the Report began,and to reach their conclusions on the Report aftersettling their policy.The prime Minister said that his own conclusions as to the handling of the problem were rather similar.rry,e reason he had put down this question was that theCommittee appeared to hold so strongly to the idea that we must single out a particular State againstvrnich to measure our needs .   ^he question of whetherit was unavoidable to single out a particular country as a potential enemy had appeared to him to befundamental, and one to which the Cabinet, ought early to direct their attention.
The Secretary of State for the Colonies suggestedthat it was impossible to reach a decision on theselarger issues until the result of the Disarmamentnegotiations was known.    If any agreement were reachedwe should know what Germany&apos;s declared programme was over a term of five years.   He appreciated, however,that the Committee could not review the problem without making s ome assumptions .The Secretary of State for Air suggested that   itwas no use putting on one side the suggestion thatGermany was our only potential enemy in Europe. Therewas every evidence that Germany was going ahead with her armaments, especially in the air.   The Chiefs ofStaff and their colleagues had taken a practical viewof the German intentions.   They had assumed that germany might become a menace in five or six years.   within that time she might even make a demand on us for colonies.   He himself put the period at which germany might be a menace at four years .    In any event adecision ought to be reached quickly, as it would be highly dangerous if we had not corrected our worstdeficiencies when Germany had re-armed.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggestedthere were two assumptions implicit in paragraph 13:(1) that the Disarmament Conference wo\ild fail:(S) that there was no provision for security.The Secretary to the Cabinet did not think it wasthe intention of his Committee to assume the failureof the disarmament Conference.   He himself had assumed that even if the Disarmament Conference succeededit would involve so much re-armament by Germany thatwe should still have to make good most of our deficien-cies. and he did not think his colleagues woulddissent from this .
The Secretary of State for India said that evenif the Disarmament- Conference did fail, and even ifthis was followed by demonstrations, and so forth,in Germany, that would not take them far towards thehuge developments that would be necessary before theywere ready for war.   The anti-Government feeling inGermany, which existed in important sections of thepopulation, ought also not to be overlooked.   Hethought that if we decided on parity in the airit would be a tremendous risk to Germany to attackthis country.    She was surrounded by possible enemies  France, Poland, with Italy none too friendly toher   and would, not be likely to risk an attack.Air parity would, in his view, mitigate one of thegreat risks .The Lord Chancellor asked if we ought not toconsider our obligations under Locarno.The Prime Minister thought that the Cabinet wouldhave to try and. arrive at some statement of what was their foreign policy on the three points raised inthe Report:-(l) As regards paragraph 12 of C.P.-64 (34),a series of propositions designed tokeep the peace in the Par East:(2) As regards Germany:(3) As regards India.
The Secretary of State for Air pointed, out thatGermany was the one country in Europe with a definitegrievance.   We had constantly been making concessions to meet the German position.   As time went on herdemands increased.   The stronger she became the moreinsistent would, be her demands.    He did. not see how we could avoid considering her as a potential enemy.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries saidwe must either exclude the whole world, or most ofthe world,  from our basis of calculation.    If we couldnot exclude the whole world we might neverthelessexclude all but a very few.   We did not single outGermany as a count.?&apos;y against which we were going towar, but France,  Italy and. the United States ascountries against which we need not make preparations.The Prime Minister pointed, out. however   the definite words of   paragraph IS, &quot;Secondly we take&quot;Germany as the ultimate potential enemy against whom&quot;our &apos;long-range&apos;  defence policy must be directed&quot;.That indicated that both from a political and a defencepoint of view we must take Germany as a potential enemy.The Lord President of the Council asked how theCabinet could discuss the question without alsodiscussing the Disarmament Conference.    In thatconnection the question to which attention wasconstantly being directed was as to whether we wereprepared to undertake a guarantee.    It might even bea choice between a guarantee and losing the friendshipof France.The Secretary of State for War recalled the cireurn-stances in which the Defence Requirements Committeehad been appointed.   Until two years.ago every cabinet had assumed, as the basis of their Defence Estimates,that there would be no masjor war for ten years fromany given date.    On that assumption all the; defence departments had budgeted, and as a result great
deficiencies had accumulated.   ^0 years ago thatassumption had been abrogated,   me position thenwas that the Defence Departments were no longer ableto assume that there would be no war for ten years.He thought that all three Defence Departments had. thenfelt that they could not properly discharge their duty,in view of their accumulated deficiencies.    He had accepted that position for a time because he had hadto weigh the dangers of unpreparedness against the risks of financial catastrophe.   whe position, howevercould not continue indefinitely.   Consequently theCabinet had appointed the Defence Requirements CommitteeTheir Report disclosed an alarming situation.   Whenthey were asked to provide a programme for remedyingthe situation they had. to make some assumptions.What the Committee said in their Report, in effect,was that in making their calculations they excludedcertain nations, but did not exclude Germany.   Thatdid not mean that they assumed we were going to warwith Germany, but if there was a risk of war withGermany then these were the requirements that oughtto be made good to provide against it.   They were bound to assume some potential enemy or enemies,    Ifthe Cabinet were prepared to say that there was norisk of trouble with Germany, then much of the report would become unnecessary.   What the Committee had saidwas that they were not proposing that we should armagainst the whole world.   They excluded Prance, Italyand America&apos;:    but there were other people   with whom,we might be ^ovced into war.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thanked, theSecretary of State for War for expressing the positionin this way .   The Committee had been told to proceed on certain assumptions, and could do nothing else.
The situation in Europe appeared to him to beclearing to the extent that there were only two alternatives, namely, either (l) competition, withre-armament: or (S) the additional security thatsome nations were asking for.   Even this wouldprobably involve some expenditure on armaments .   he wanted to discuss that question first,    The more theD.R.C, Report was studied the more he thought it would.be seen how Important this was.The Secretary of State for India said he had noobjection to the Committee having some basis fordiscussion.   What he did object to was going backto the position of 1906 to 1914, namely, thateverybody was preparing for war with Germany.   we might eventually be driven to it, but we were not,in his opinion, yet at that point.The Prime Minister said that       that assumptionbutwas not being madeywe ought to work out every possible alternative, including that of some system of collective security.-IS-
The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries      290said much depended on who was going to threaten security.If it was Germany the provision of proper defencesmight he less than now proposed.The Poastmaster-General suggested that thedecision on Paragraph 4 should not he reached untilthe results of the Disarmament situation were known.For his part, he would not like to give an answer today.The Prime Minister agreed that that decision could not be taken today arid that it would benecessary to consider how far it would be possible toreduce our commitments by a security scheme.The President of the Board of Trade hojjed thatif alternatives were to be discussed the Cabinet wouldwasdecide on the pros and cons of what/termed securityby which was meant a new grouping of allies.      They oughtto probe what was the meaning of that proposal.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out that the question was raised in his memorandum (CP. 68  (34),      He drew attention to theterms of reference of the Defence Requirements committee as set forth in the first paragraph of the Reportwhere by decision of the Cabinet the United States,France and Italy were excluded from the basis of calculation.      In view of this it seemed to him that theDefence Requirements Committee had had no alternative but to proceed on the lines they had adopted.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs saidthat if Germany was to be looked upon as a potential enemy he could not imagine our being engaged with hersingle handed.      He asked that public opinion at homeshould be taken into consideration.      It would be a mistake for the Cabinet to make up their minds either on a huge expenditure on armaments and a new armamentsrace or to new commitments.The Prime Minister pointed out that the Report-13-
under consideration did not involve armaments &quot;beyondproved deficiencies. - He suggested thatfor the moment the decision on Paragraph 4 might &quot;bethat the Cabinet could not reach a decision pending(l) the result of the Disarmament Conference,  (2)other ways of   approaching our security.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs then read a draft decision which he had prepared duringthe meeting for consideration by his colleagues.After a good deal of discussion in detailthis &quot;was adopted in the form set out in theconclusion.While the Secretary of State was redraftingthe discussion continued.The President of the Board of Trade askedwhether in giving some security we should not perhapshe undertaking a large further commitment.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that somecommitments were unavoidable whatever our policyout we might find a security commitment trielessexpensive of the two.The Secretary of State for Air said we had reached apoint where it was necessary to take a verypractical view.      Excuses might &quot;be found for delaying the decision, indefinitely.        If there was much delay in taking decisions on our armaments policy he thoughta serious situation might arise in the country.He was being pressed very hard about our air position.The question he asked was when we should begin to lay the foundations of our future policy in air armaments.The Secretary of State for India agreed that along delay would be disastrous    from every point of view.The Prime Minister said there was no intentionto have a long delay.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed and thought that in any event there could not be much-14-
delay as the French Note would bring us to the brinkof the next stage of the Disarmament discussions, andthe Conference was to meet on April 10th5The Secretary of State for Air recalled thestatement made by the Lord President of the Councilin the House of Commons *The Prime Minister pointed out that the lord president of the Council had used very careful language.The Lord president of the Council agreed but pointed out that though for the moment the criticswere silent they would break out again uefore long.After some further discussion of the draftformula prepared by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,  the Cabinet decided to record the followingprovisional conclusion on Question 4 of CP.  70 (34):/ If the Disarmament discussions do notend in agreement - and even if there isan agreement involving substantialrearmament of Germany - Germany&apos;s powermay soon be great enough to make her a potential danger to others, and in thesecircumstances the Cabinet must withoutdelay consider the following courses(which may not be complete alternatives):(i) joining in arranging to provide further security against breach of the peace;(ii)    facing very heavy further expenditure on armaments.It is recognised that there may be otheralternatives to be considered in additionto those mentioned.
4,    The Prime Minister read Paragraph 5 ofC.P. 70 (34) as follows:-Does the Cabinet approve the Committee&apos;sassumption that we should aim in principleat a programme spread over a five-year period (para,  14, D.R0C.  14), in relationto -(i)    The Par East?(ii)    Germany?A short discussion on this question tendedshow that the question of a time limit was ratherclosely connected with the final decision on policyand the Cabinet agreed -To record no decision for thepresent.
5.    The Prime Minister read Question 6 of        29^CP.  70 (34) , viz:Is there any criticism of the general statement of our deficiencies in theevent of trouble in the Par East?(Paras,  18-21, D,Ft, C  14).The Secretary of State for India askedhow the deficiencies had been drawn up.    Had theymerely been provided by each of the Defence Servicesand adopted?      Had substitution been considered?Had there been any consideration of strategicalplans?The Secretary to the Cabinet, as Chairmanof the Defence Requirements Committee, asked theCabinet to remember that the enquiry by the defence requirements Committee had been preceded by anannual review by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, I(C.I.D, paper ,1133)  to which the Cabinet had drawnAthe attention of the Defence Requirements Committeein laying down their terms of reference.-       Thatannual review by the Chiefs of Staff Committee had beena particularly comprehensive one and had covered the whole of the general strategical considerations in every part of the world affecting Imperial Defence, ,and had been approved by the Cabinet to governfor the present the expenditure of the defence departments.        The Defence Requirements Committeehad not reopened that unanimous report.      Theirprocedure had been to invite each Department to submit a statement ot its worst cteficiencies.        these statements had been discussed in great detail andat a number of meetings in the light of the Cabinetfsdecisions and the reports referred to therein,every   single item in tables A, B,  C and D had been examined in detail.      Certain questions had been adjourned by the Committee in order that they might beconsidered in their strategical aspects by the Chiefsof Staff Committee, e,g.  the aircraft defence for-17-
Singapore and other ports.      It was only after this minute scrutiny of every item as a result of which many changes had been made, that a unanimous report had been reached.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed outthat if the Navy, for example, was to be in a positionto fulfil its responsibilities to the Far East    itcould hardly dispense with such items as modernisation of capital ships, anti-submarine equipment forauxiliary vessels, fleet fuelling reserves and other items of the kind.      There were, however, some items in the Report such as the defences of Colombo orPenang and perhaps Hong Kong (the importance of whiohhe did not overrate) where it might be possible to goslower if it were possible to reach an agreement with japan.        No one could say that these deficienciesought not to be made good, but the main question was thewhi chtime within/they could be provided.The Prime Minister said it would be necessaryto be careful how this decision was minuted.      TheCommittee had given&apos; a catalogue of requirements not      )or importance      iarranged in any particular order of priority/      TheCaoinet must not be taken as having passed the full      jprogramme as an order for execution.The Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to theAdmiralty asked even if the Cabinet could not give atime limit now they should give it later on.The Lord President of the Council said that thiswould have to be done a little later.The Prime Minister asked the Admiralty represen-tative to max;e a note to raise it at the appropriate time.
The Cabinet agreed:-(a) Subject to the Prime Minister&apos;s remarksrecorded on the previous pages, to approve the general statement of ourdeficiencies set forth in paragraphs18-21 of D.R.C  14.(b) That the question of a time limit shouldbe considered later.
