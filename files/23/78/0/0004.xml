THE OXFORD 2.    The Prime Minister consulted his colleaguesGROUP MOVE-WENT&apos;, as to whether he should accede to a request fromthe Oxford Group Movement to receive a Deputation.The Cabinet were unanimously-opposed to his doing so.(^he Minister of Agriculture andFisheries entered at this point,and the Prime Minister informed him of the desire of the Cabinet thathe should accept from them a tokenof good will and wishes for happi-ness on the occasion of his forth-coming wedding.   He invited him toconfer with the First commissioner of Works, who had the matter in handon behalf of the Cabinet.The Minister of Agriculture andFisheries replied in appropriateterms .)
FRANCE.disturbances in.French Dis-criminat oryMeasures .(pr previous reference:Cabinet 3(34), Con-elusion 7.)FA .3. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs made a short statement to the Cabinet about the disturbances in Paris, reported in the newspapers of even date.   He had spoken to the British Minister,who had reported that there had been a good, deal offiring on the previous evening, not apparentlymachine-guns, but probably mostly revolver shots,and that he had the impression that there might be some 30 killed and 100 wounded.   A reassuring feature of the situation was that the mob apparently had. noleader of a calibre likely to foctis the discontent.He had not received official information of troublesin the Provinces,   ^he British Minister reported thatthe disturbances had been directed against the Chamberbut as the Chamber was not meeting this evening the disturbances were not likely to reciir until the morrowM. Pal^.dier&apos;s Parliamentary victory on the previous evening was not very important, as the votes were only on points of procedure.    It seemed probable,however, that M, Daladier would again succeed whenthe division was on the real vote of confidence.mhe British Minister was extremely grateful forthe favourable response that had been given to hisappeal for a delay until Saturday morning&apos;s p-r-essin the issue of the Tariff Order in retaliation forthe French discrimination against British trade.mhe Prime Minister said he thoroughly agreed with the substance and the spirit of the messagenotifying the delay &apos;Telegram No.43, of February 6,1934. to Mr Campbell, Paris),
AUSTRIA.ProposedAppeal toLeague ofNations .(previous ousReferenc e:Cabinet 3(34), Con-clusion 4.)p./?.4.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,after alluding to the interest in Austria that hadbeen displayed during the Debate in the House ofCommons on the previous day, reported that he hadreceived a telegram, from Vienna to the effect that,as the result of the deliberations of the Councilof Ministers, a full dossier of material in the possession of the Austrian Government, showing theextent of German propaganda, accompanied by proofs,had been despatched by special courier to theAustrian representatives in London, Paris and Romefor communication to the Governments concerned.mhe Italian Government had suggested that this dossiershould be communicated so as to give the three great powers an opportunity of coming to an agreementamongst themselves as to the attitude to be taken up on the Austrian case.   The Secretary of Statesuggested that this rather resembled an approach toa member of a jury in a litigation.   He thought he ought to say, when the dossier was presented, thatwe were prepared, to do our duty as a Member of theLeague of Nations, but that we could not express any opinion after hearing only one side of the case.He did not propose, however, to reply to this effect until he had had an opportunity to study the dossier.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet mustleave the matter to the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, with whom he agreed that we must exercisegreat ca^eThe Secretary of State for Foreign affairs recalled that the.Cabinet had given him authority onJanuary 24th (Cabinet 2 (34), Conclusion 1) todiscuss the Austrian question at the ministerial committee on Disarmament, and if necessary he would
raise this question at that Committee.The Cabinet acceded to the proposalsof the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the Prime Minister.(See also Conclusion 5 below,)
AUSTRIA.Forms ofAss is tanceto.(previous reference e:Cabinet 3(34), Con-elusion 4.)f. K. -5.   With, reference to the discussion at theprevious Meeting on the subject of forms of assist-ance to Austria, the Cabinet had before them a Memo-randum by the President of the Board of Trade(C.P.-35 (34)) informing them of an interview hehad had with Baron Franckenstein and Dr. Schiiller,at which suggestions were put forward for obtainingan improvement in Austrian exports to the UnitedKingdom.   Their proposal was that the United kingdom should enter into an agreement under which a quota of Austrian goods, based on the figures for 1930,should be admitted into this country at half theexisting rate of duty.   The estimated cost to theExchequer would be some  175,000 a year, and new legislation would be required.    The President ofthe Board of Trade was of opinion that the objectionshe had already outlined to the Cabinet to the granting of preferences to Austrian manufactures remained asstrong as ever, but if the Cabinet decided that dis-cussions should be proceeded with on the above linesan endeavour should be made to obtain an adequatereturn for British trade as part of a Trade Agreement.Dr. Schuller had indicated that the austrian government would be prepared to consider proposalsfor increasing the quotas of United Kingdom goods which could be admitted into Austria.   A paper giving particulars of the rates of duty and of the volumeof trade in the goods to which it was suggested theAustrian proposal should apply was attached to theMemorandum.^he President of the Board of Trade made astatement to the Cabinet on his meeting with BaronFranckens tein and Dr. Schtfller, on the lines ofhis Memorandum.    He mentioned also that the Austrianrepresentatives had raised the question of our not
protesting against the grant of preference byneighbouring States, and had thanked him for not making any such protest in the/case of their agreementwith Poland.    The President had replied that hethought it unlikely that any difficulty would beraised so long as their agreements were confined toneighbouring States and were not world-wide in extent.They assured him that their request applied only toneighbouring States.    It had taken him some time tobring home to the representatives the impossibility of asking Parliament to accede to their tariffproposals, which involved in effect a grant from parliament to Austria to enable its manufacturers to compete with our own manufacturers and to beatthem out of our markets..   They then went away toconsider the matter further.The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed theCabinet that we might possibly be able to help the austrians by a conversion operation which would beof real benefit to them.   The question was being examined.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs referred to the proposal in C.P.-35 (34) for anagreement whereby some concession could be made toAustrian trade in return for a larger consumptionof British coal in Austria.^he President of the Board of Trade said thathe had had to warn the Austrian representatives thatit was very doubtful if anything could be done inthis direction on a basis favourable to them, andthey had replied that they would give him more information on the subject.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out thatthe coal proposal did not surmount the difficulty that other nations would, under most-favoured-nation-7-
clauses, insist on sharing in any trade advantageswe gave to Austria.The President of the Board of trade pointed out,however, that in any event any such arrangement couldonly he worked on the basis of consent by other Powershaving most-favoured-nation arrangements with us,and th-se other Powers, unfortunately, includedG ermany,The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs pointed out that the Government could not possiblysurvive a proposal to give discriminatory tradefacilities to Austria, and it would be a mistake togive the Austrian representatives the impression that anything could be done on these lines.The Prime Minister said that was clearly thePresident of the Board of &quot;&quot;rade/s own view.   Rethought that as negotiations were still continuingit would, suffice if the Cabinet took note of theMemorandum.The Cabinet took note of CP.-35 (34).
EGYPT .Resumption of treaty Nego-t tiations,Instructionsto HighCommiss practitioner.(previous reference:Cabinet 45( 33),  Con-clusion 3.)3Zti6 . ^he Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs  (CP.-32(34))  on the subject of instructions to the new HighCommissioner in Egypt regarding the  resumption of treaty negotiations.   After quoting the trend of theviews of the Cabinet at the Meeting referred to inthe margin, the Memorandum stated that unless theinstructions contained therein were varied, the HighCommissioner would be authorised, to say that wecontemplated entering upon Treaty negotiations withthe Egyptian Government some time in the course ofthe present year,   ^he Secretary of S^ate was ofopinion that it would not be advisable to say anything to the Egyptians to this effect, and asked the Cabinetto modify the instructions on two grounds, viz.,(i) that the present Egyptian Government was not asuitable Government with which to negotiate a Treaty:and (ii) that it would, be inexpedient to annouce our readiness to open Treaty negotiations until wehad. determined in our own minds where we stood onthe unsettled, but most important, point of the futurelocation of the British forces in Egypt,   The Secretaryof State then outlined in his Memorandum general considerations which the Cabinet might think it well to refer to the Egyptian Sub-Committee of the Committeeof Imperial Defence to whom the general question ofthe Treaty had been remitted (Cabinet 50 (32), Con-clusion 6(a)).In the course of a short discussion the Secretaryof State for Air, referring to paragraph 6 of C.P.-32(24), suggested that in replying to King FuadSir Miles Lamps on would be well advised not to mention any particular period within which he was tomake a further report on the situation in Egypt:e.g,, instead of &quot;in three or four months time&quot;
it might be better to use some vaguer term.^he Chancellor of the Fx chequer, referring to paragraph 7 of the Memorandum, suggested that therewas no need to order Sir Wiles Lamps on to send, his report promptly on the pro&apos;s and ccn&apos;s of moving thetroops.   He hoped, also, that Sir Miles Laropsonwould obtain the views of the British -Commander-in-Chief.   ,The Secretary of State for Air informed theCabinet that on the occasion of his recent visit to cairo he had obtained the impression that the Teatyhad rather sunk into the background, and he doubted if King Fuad really wanted it.^he Secretary of State for War said he had recently seen the British Commander-in-Chief, whohad given him the impression that King Fuad was practically an absolute monarch today .mhe Prime Minister suggested that in thesecircumstances Sir Miles Lamps on might find that thebest way of handling the question, if raised, wasto suggest that an agreement was not likely to bereached, which would increase King Fuad&apos;s prestige:for. example, as King Fuad knew, we could not concedeanything on the Sudan.   Would it not, therefore, beto King Fuadrs own advantage to let sleeping dogslie?   This idea would,  of course, have to be insinua-ted perhaps informally, but certainly only on a convenient opportunity and. in a tactful manner.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said he would draw Sir Miles Lamps on&apos;s attention to thissuggest, i on *Subject to the above, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That if King Fuad should raise thequestion o^ the An/no.-Egyptian Treaty,the British High Commissioner shouldbe instructed to reply that he had had some preliminary discussion? in London,
but. that the British government wished him to make a further reporton the situation within a reasonable time, as they felt that they couldnot decide how to proceed until theyhad the full benefit of his advicebased, on actual experience of theconditions of the country and other circumstances .    Sir Miles Lampsonshould, further be atithorised to use his own discretion as to whether ornot he should drop a hint that theprospects of Treaty negotiationsbeing entered upon were naturally -affected by considerations relative to the stability of the egyptian government:(b) &quot;&quot;hat Sir Miles Lamps on should, in due course, submit his own views, formedon the spot and after consultationwith the military Commander-in-chief in Egypt, as to the pro&apos;s and con&apos;sof moving the troops:(c) That the Papers before the cabinet and their comments thereon shouldbe remitted to the Sub-Committee ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence on egypt, to whom the proposals of theForeign Office for Egypt were remittedby the Cabinet on October 11,  1932(Cabinet 50 (32), Conclusion 6a).
THE Secretary Of STATE FORTHE COLONIES .(previous reference:Cabinet 3(34), Con-clusion 1.)107.   The Prime Minister read a telegram receivedfrom Kenya to the effect that the Secretary of-State for the Colonies was now well on the road torecovery and that no further bulletins or dailytelegrams would be necessary.   His passage had beenbooked provisionally.The Cabinet agreed  That the Prime Minister, on their behalf, should send an expression of their satisfaction at this news.
WAV AT. CON- Q* The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bySTRUCTION ,PROGRAMME the First Lord of the Admiralty (C.P.-311 (33))FOR 1934.asking approval to the following   programme of naval construction for 19 34:-(previous reference: 4 Cruisers (3 of MINOTAUR type, aboutCabinet 61 9,000, and 1 ARFTBUSA type,(33), Con- about 5,200 tons)conclusion 4 .)1 Leader and 8 Destroyers .i3*?(3*y)/ . 3 Submarines (l Minelayer Submarine and2 S, or Patrol type)1 Aircraft Carrier.5 Sloops (2 General Service type,2 Sloop Minesweepers and1 net layer)1 Surveying Ship7 small Vessels (namely, 2 Coastal Sloops,3 Gate and Boom DefenceVessels, a Submarine SchoolTender and a Trawler) .The First Lord hoped,  from the standpoint of unem-ployment, to be able to place the orders for two ofthe Cruisers and the Leader and Destroyers aboutChristmas, 19 34, and those for some of the smallervessels still earlier.   Attached to the memorandum was a financial statement showing the total estimatedcost of the Programme and the manner in which theexpenditure would normally be spread-over the yearsof building.The First Lord of the Admiralty informed theCabinet that he had decided to withdraw his proposal in paragraph 11 of C.P.-311 (33) to-place the ordersfor certain ships included in this programmesomewhere about Christmas, 1934, instead of at theend of the financial year.    This would involve aJ? l$0,000reduction in expenditure of S^Hry&amp;G-O in the present financial year,  and he only asked, for  50,000 to start the building programme.
The President of the Board of Trade urged thatin placing the orders the claims of the North east coast, where there was great unemployment, shouldbe taken into account.The First lord undertook not to overlook theclaims of the North East Coast, but emphasised thatthe Admiralty could not ignore the economic aspectand could therefore only work within narrow limitsin the acceptance of tenders.The Secretary of State for Air pointed out that. R.7(if)-3,        the proposed additional Air era &quot;fa Carrier would involvethe provision of a large number of (72) additionalaeroplanes.    If the Air Ministry were allowed toprovide these additional to their normal programmethere would be no difficulty.    Otherwise, however,they would have to be deducted from their normalprovision for home defence and other services;    andthis would create a great difficulty .   In addition,this increase in the number of aeroplanes for theFleet Air Arm would involve the Air Ministry inconsiderable expenditure for aerodromes, training facilities, and so forth.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out thathis Memorandum had been circulated before Christmas ,&quot;^here had been correspondence during the Recessbetween the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Statefor Air and himself (with communication of the letters to the Chancellor of the Exchequer)  on this subject.In the first, letter the Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State for Air had suggested that the question oughtto await the Report of the Defence requirements committee,    He had been informed that that Committee,which included the Chie:* of the Air Staff, wasfavoxirable to the provision of these facilities.-14-
The Secretary of State for Air said that he hadbeen given to understand that the Chief of the AirStaff was opposed to the acceptance of theseliabilities by the Air Ministry.^he Secretary to the Cabinet, as Chairman ofthe Defence Requirements Committee, explained thatthat Committee had not dealt with the Estimates ofthe Defence Services for the coming year as that matter had not fallen within their Terms of Refer-ence.    In examining the question of our worst-deficiencies, however, they had found it necessaryto go in some detail into the general question ofthe position of the Elect Air Arm.   They had foundthat in relation to the aerial development of theJapanese Navy the position was already unsatisfactory and would be very much worse within a few years,unless remedies were provided.   On this general question, of which the matter before the Cabinetformed a part, he was under the impression that every member of his Committee was agreed thatremedial measures would have to be taken.The Chancellor of the Exchequer confirmed thereport of the Secretary to the Cabinet by quotationsfrom a Minute he had received from the Secretary tothe Treasury.   He pointed out that these shipsappeared, according to the information at his disposal, absolutely essential to enable the fleet to do its work.    It appeared useless to have a Fleetif it was not provided, with its indispensable quota of aeroplanes.The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested thatthe commitment did. not appear an immediate one forthe Air Ministry, as the ship would not be completed before 1937.
The Secretary of State for Air pointed out,however, that arrangements would have to be taken up at an early date for staff and training.The Secretary of State for India reminded theCabinet that besides involving the provision ofadditional machines, training facilities, and so forth, by the Air Ministry, this proposal wouldmean that unless additional aircraft were provided72 less machines would be available for home defence.The Cabinet were also reminded that if aDisarmament Agreement were reached whereby the totalnumber of aircraft was limited, the provision of machines for the Fleet Air Arm would place the AirMinistry in a great difficulty.    It was suggested,however, that at the moment the prospects of suchinternational limitation had rather receded.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed thatthere might be questions of priority, which, however ,it was premature to decide at this moment.The Prime Minister pointed out that if a startwas made with the new Aircraft Carrier we shouldhave to begin very early to make arrangements for supplying the aircraft and the personnel.This was confirmed by the Secretary of Statefor Air .The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs suggested that the Cabinet should take theSecretary of State for Air&apos;s statement as a warning that the provision of the Aircraft Carrier involved an extra expense that would have to be met and whichwould fall on the Air Ministry !&apos;s Vote,^he suggestion was made that if the programmes of the Services could be considered together thiskind of difficulty would be avoided.-16-
The Prime Minister said that he had hopedthat all such co-ordination would have .been done before the question reached the Cabinet.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the Naval Programmesubmitted. inC .P.-311 ( 33), as summarised above, subject to thewithdrawal announced by the FirstLord of the Admiralty of theproposal to place the orders forcertain of the vessels earlier than usual:(b) ,f1o take note that the provisionof an additional Aircraft Carrierwould also involve additional future expenditure by the Air Ministry.(mhe Prime Minister, who had another officialengagement, withdrew at this point, and theLord. President of the Council took the Chair.)

APPENDIX.Note of observations of the Ministerof Health in reference to CP. 12(34).The Minister of Health said that he might usefully draw the attention of the Cabinet to the salient features of his proposals, which were in one respect at leastfar-re aching.The essence of the proposals was a direct attack upon the evil of overcrowding, on the same lines as the attack already launched upon the evil of slums.    Experienceshewed that a proper supply of houses for wage-earners couldnot be looked upon as a merely arithmetical question as tothe number of houses supplied.    The situation of the houseswas also of the essence of the problem.    Overcrowding wascharacteristically an evil associated with the centralareasof large towns.    New accommodation on the outskirts was no solution to the problem, involving as it did the uprooting of people from the neighbourhood they looked upon as their home, and moving them far from where they worked.    What was needed was more rehousing on the overcrowded and slum sites.In order that the rehousing in the central areas concerned might accommodate as large a population as possible, normallyredevelopment was necessary, in order to make the best ofthe land, and more housing in flats.    The redevelopment plansmust be also properly co-ordinated with the general plans forthe lay-out of the town.    This was work which could not beleft to private enterprise.    It was too expensive becauseof the greater cost of sites and of building flats, andmore unity of ownership was necessary for economic development.Subsidy or grant would be necessary for the work.
It was proposed that there should be a duty onthe local authorities, as time and means permitted, tomake schemes covering both slum clearance, reconditioningunder the powers suggested in the Paper, and, in particular,the work of dealing with overcrowding under the conditionsproposed.The Minister gave a further account of theproposals in the Paper relating to the management of publicly owned houses and to assistance for the work ofPublic Utility Societies.
