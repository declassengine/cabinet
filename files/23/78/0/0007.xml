SAL-B OFBRITISHAERO ENGINESTO GERMANY.(previous reference cabinet 49(S3), Con-clusion 4.)I. The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of the sale of anadditional 11* Armstrong Siddeley aero engines toGermany, and. a probable further order for 260engines:-A. Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (0.P.-59(34)) covering an historical summaryof the question and a statement of reasons for and against intervention by His Majesty&apos;s Government.   Havingregard to the extensive character ofthe new orders the Secretary of Statefelt great hesitation in signifying a purely departmental concurrence without giving his colleagues an opportunityof further considering the matter:A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Air (C.P.-60.(34)) suggesting that from the point of view of bringing 200,000 worth of work into the country the order for llft engines should be filled, and that if the decision regarding the further 260 engineswere held over until later it couldbe seen how the Germans actually usedthose now to be supplied.   He agreed with the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs that in present circumstances the German request for a small numberof pilots to be trained at Sir JohnSiddeley&apos;s school at Hamble should notbe allowed.The President of the Board of Trade informed the Cabinet that his Department had made enquiriesand that both the American and French industries were supplying aero engines to the German A.E.G.The question was raised as to what the positionwould be if the order were sanctioned and the matter was mentioned in a Debate on the Private armaments industry.    One suggestion was that the reply wouldbe that the engines were required for civilianaeroplanes.   In this connection it was suggestedthat the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should instruct the British Ambassador in Paris^formally to ask the French Government what theywere doing in the matter.   The comment on thiswas that the French would probably ask why the
question was raised and what we ourselves were doing.As the French did not work on a licensing system the Government could even plead, ignorance of what their manufacturers were doing.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forAir said there was no doubt that German civil aviation-tion was in a position to absorb 200 aeroplanes.When it came to any larger order this was moredoubtful.Another suggestion for meeting the criticism thatwould be raised in a Debate on the Private armaments industry was to say that legally we could not stop the provision of these machines for private industry.It was pointed out, however, that this would be seized upon by the critics to* prove that the privatearmaments industry was able, owing to laxity ofGovernment control and under the guise of supplyingengines to civilian aircraft, to arm a foreign country, and that the whole question of the contro-versy on the private armaments industry would beraised.In this connection it was admitted that the engines supplied for civilian machines could be usedin small fighter machines.On the other hand, the Cabinet were reminded that,if these orders were not accepted, our own skilled workers would be thrown out of work and othercountries would supply the engines required - amatter on which the President of the Board of trade said there was no doubt about the evidence.The Cabinet were also reminded that by acceptingorders of this kind we increased our own capacityof output, and any increase in capacity was ofImportance to Imperial Defence as a whole.
The Prime Minister, while admitting that theproposal was rather repugnant to him personally,said that if the Cabinet wished the order to beaccepted we ought to make sure of as large a proportionof the/ order as possible, and not place obstacles whichwould result in our obtaining only a small proportionof the orders.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To accept the proposal of the Secretaryof State for Air that Sir John Siddeleyshould be allowed to fill the order for118 engines, making 200 in all, to be delivered, in Germany.   The provision ofa further 260 engines should be made conditional upon a clearer statementlater on of the purposes for whichthey would be required:(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should communicate with theBritish Ambassador in Paris and inform him that His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldbe glad if he could learn discreetly theattitude of the French Government inthis matter.
THE PERSIANGULP.Oil Conees-g ions inQatar,ProposedGuaranteeof Protec-tion toSheikh.^previous reference:Cabinet 6(34), Con-clusion 3.)2. The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of the proposal to guaranteeprotection to the Sheikh of Qatar:-A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for India (.C.P.-49 (34)).covering a Report by the Chiefs- ofStaff Sub-Committee of the Committeeof Imperial Defence.    At the meeting referred to in the margin the ques-tions raised in this Memorandum were referred for consideration by theCommittee of Imperial Defence:A Note by the Secretary (CP.-58 (34))covering the following Conclusions ofa Meeting of Ministers held onFebruary 22nd immediately after theCommittee of Imperial Defence had met:-(i)(ii)(iii)(iv)(v)That it was desirable, in principle,that any oil (concessions granted inthe Sheikhdom of Qatar should beretained in British hands:That before the question of theopening of negotiations could beconsidered further it would benecessary to draw up a formula asto the basis of such negotiations:this formula to represent a middle course between the proposals of theSecretary of State for India for full and complete guarantees and therecommendations of the Chiefs ofStaff for a guarantee limited to protection against major aggression:To instruct the Standing OfficialSub-Committee for Questions Concerningthe Middle East to work out a formulaon the lines indicated in (ii) above as early as possible:That there should be included, in theformula document an indication ofthe geographical boundary which would limit the extent of any guarantee that might be contemplated:That a short Report to the Cabinet-should be drawn up for consideration at their next Meeting, which would include the formula to be suggestedby the Standing Official Subcommitteefor Questions concerning the middle east, together with a furtherrecommendation that if approvalwas given to open negotiations withthe Sheikh of Qatar on the linesof the formula to be prepared, theSecretary of State for India shouldbe asked to keep his colleagues intouch with the progress of thenegotiations, and that if theydeveloped unfavourably the basismight have to be reconsidered.
Attached to the Note was a copy of the formula pre-pared by the Standing Official Sub-Committee for questions Concerning the Middle East, referred, to inC onelus ion (i i) above.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the Conclusions of theMeeting of Ministers, held onFebruary 22nd, as set forth inC,P,-5* (34) and quoted above:(b) mo approve the formula suggestedby the Standing Official Sub-Committeefor Questions concerning the MiddleEas t. (Appendix ,)
3. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Air (0.P.-57 (34))acquainting his colleagues with developments since last November in regard to the Royal Air ForceProgramme for next year and the amount of the 1934Air Estimates.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer had now agreed to the Programme then under consideration,which the Secretary of State was able to implementwith an increase of only  135,000 in net Estimates.These would remain substantially lower than two yearsago, and approximately  1,000,000 lower than in 1931.He pointed out, however, that other Powers, almostwithout exception, were pursuing a far more activepolicy of air development;    in fact, both France and russia now had roughly twice the British first-line strength in the air.   The Secretary of State expressed his grave perturbation at this situation and feared that the very limited extent of next year&apos;s programme would arouse considerable criticism.    He felt,however, that with the fate of the disarmament convention still undecided it would, not be advisable to consider any more extensive measures in the coming year.The Cabinet approved the proposals contained, in CP.-57 (34) for theRoyal Air Force programme of new units,1934, vis;.:- -(a) The formation of two sqtiadronsfor Home Defence, which will still leave 8 squadrons of the 19S3s cheme out s t and ing:(b) mhe reconstltution on an effectivebasis of two Home Defence squadrons at present incorporated in one ofour experimental establishments:(c) The formation of one flying boatsquadron.In addition, two flights (or the equivalent of one squadron) to beadded to the Fleet Air Arm, making,with the units mentioned above, atotal of four new squadrons to be formed.
4. The Cabinet had before, them a Note by the PrimeMinister (C.P.-50 (34)) submitting for their approvala scheme (agreed to by the Chancellor of theExchequer, the First Lord of the Admiralty and theFirst Commissioner of Works) for the establishmentof a Maritime Museum on,National scale at the Queen&apos;house, Greenwich,   As the result of a public statement in 1927 to the effect that upon the removal of theRoyal Hospital School from Greenwich to Holbrookin about five years from that date the Q,ueen&apos;s house would be allocated for the purposes of the Museum,many valuable gifts had been made in anticipation ofits establishment:    in particular by Sir John Caird,who had also offered to make a Deed of Gift of hisremaining collections and to defray the cost ofadapting and equipping the buildings at Greenwich(estimated by the Office   of Works at  89,000) subjectto certain conditions.   The expenditure involved inthe scheme would be as follows:-(i) An annual charge (less saving of  1,200on Navy Votes)  of perhaps  15,000 perannum, including allied services, onthe maintenance of the Museum:    only a fraction of this would be required in1934, and it would probably be some time before the full figure was reached.(ii)A non-recurrent expenditure of  15,000to be incurred in 1954 and 1935 by theOffice of Works on the Queen&apos;a House asan Historic Building.   This expenditure would be coincident with, but notdependent on, the establishment of aMuseum.The first step would be the introduction of a Billfor the establishment of the Museum,   The bill would also contain a clause empowering the admiralty to make a free grant of the property to the Office
The President of the Board of Trade welcomed the proposal very warmly.    It was a deplorable factthat this country, which ought to take the lead inall maritime matters, possessed no Maritime Museumon a National scale.   The thanks to Sir John Oairdcould not be too cordial.The Prime Minister said that, generally speaking,he was disinclined to send, letters of thanks onbehalf of the Cabinet,    On this occasion he proposed to write himself and thank Sir John Caird,and he would go so far as to tell him how cordiallythe Cabinet had accepted his offer.The First Lord of the Admiralty said it was important to him to obtain a Bill indemnifying him for making a free grant of the property concerned to the Office of &apos;*-forks .&quot;lie Prime Minister asked the First Lord to speak to him about the form of the Bill.   He thought itmight be arranged so as to be taken by agreementafter 1.1 o7clock, but he would, like an opportunityin connection with the Bill to express pttblicly theGovernment*s thanks to Sir John Caird.The Cabinet agreed  -To approve the proposals in C.P.-50(34) for the establishment of aMaritime Museum on a National scaleat the Q,xieen&apos;s House, Greenwich, aswell as the introduction of a Billfor the establishment of the Museum,which would include a clause empowering the Admiralty to make a free grantof the property to the Office of Works .
^THE INC XT WENTm&apos;o SEDITIONBILL.Applicationto police force.&quot;previous reference:Cabinet 53(S3), Con-c Pus ion 6*)5. The Cabinet had before them a Most secret memorandum by the Home Secretary (C.P.-53 (34))asking authority to extend the provisions of thedraft Incitement to Sedition Bill (approved by theCabinet at the Meeting referred to in the margin)to cover the Police as well as the Defence Services .He thought it desirable to take the opportunity ofthis Bill to extend the powers which already existedunder the Police Act, 1919, and appropriate that any measure for extending the existing powers for dealingwith attempts to create disaffection among theDefence Services should also be applied to the Police.In the absence of the Home Secretary the Cabinetdid not feel able to deal finally with this question.No point was raised, about the extension of theprovisions of the draft Incitement to Sedition Billto the Defence Services, but the proposed extensionof Police powers was criticised as rather oonsider-able.The Cabinet asked, that the Home Secretary mightbe requested, before the next Meeting, to circulate(if possible in the form of a table) a Memorandumshowing the existing powers under the Police Act,1919, and the additions now proposed.
PETROLEUM INGREAT BRITAIN,MineralRightsin.The Petroleum(Production)Bill.(previous reference:Cabinet 6(34), Con-clusion 8a)6. The Cabinet had before them the Report of the petroleum (Production) Bill Committee (C.P.-41 (34)),appointed on January 31st (Cabinet 3 (34), conclusion) to consider the question of compensation for the compulsory acquisition of surface rights .   In orderto ensure the passage of the Bill through parliament the Committee felt it would be necessary to insertsome special provisions regarding compensation inthe event of interference under the compmlsory powersproposed to be granted.   A draft clause giving effectto their proposals was attached to the Report, and theCommittee recommended its incorporation in the Bill.The Cabinet approved, the Report ofthe Petroleum (Production) BillCommittee (0,P.-41*(34)), and invited the President of the Board of Tradeto proceed with the drafting of a Billon these lines.
4OTIMQNY 7. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byPOISONINGDUE- TO THE the Minister of Health (C .P.-55 (34)) on the use of use OFRHAMELLFD antimony in enamelled vessels, which had beenVESSELS 8proved to be deleterious to health.    Special investi-gations had been made, and a report by a technicalofficer of his Department showed that all enamelscontaining antimony gave up small amounts of metalto food.   The Minister of Health proposed to publishthis report and to proceed (in consultation with theBoard of Trade and the interests concerned) toprepare legislation to prohibit the importation,manufacture or sale in the United Kingdom of a defined, class of hollow-ware containing antimony inthe enamel.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Minister of Health as set-forth in CP,-55 (.34) and summarised above.
the  WORKMEN&apos; 3COMPENSATIONACT (1925)AMENDMENTSBILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 6(54),  Cen-clusion 13.) -The Cabinet again had under consideration theWorkmen&apos;s Compensation Act (1925) Amendments Bill,introduced in the House of Commons by a private member and down for Second Reading on Friday,March 2, 1934.The President of the Board, of Trade said thatthe intentions of the Bill were quite good.   Hethought the Government should support it generally,though it was necessary to provide some safeguardfor mutual insurance, which was a difficult matter.The Prime Minister said he thought it was the wish of the Cabinet that the Government spokesman should, say something helpful about the Bill without going so far as to promise&apos;1 time for the passage ofits later stages.The Cabinet instructed the Secretaryto inform the Home Secretary of theirviews .
THE REGULATIONOF IMPORTS(SWEATED GOODSAMD forced labour) BILL.(previous reference:Cat-inet 6(34), G on-clusion 14.)9. The Cabinet again had under consideration the regulation of Imports (Sweated Goods and forced labour) Bill, introduced in the House of Commons bya Private Member and down for Second Reading onFriday, March 2, 1934.The Cabinet were under the impression that theBill referred to in the preceding Conclusion wouldtake the time of the House of Commons and that the regulation of Imports (Sweated Goods and forced labour) Bill would not come to a Division, even if a discussion was opened.(NOTE:   The Secretary to the Cabinet hascommunicated with the Home secretary on the subject of the Billsmentioned in this and the precedingConclusion, sending a copy to theParliamentary Secretary to theTreasury.)
10. The Cabinet had tinder consideration theHouse of.lords Reform Pill, introduced in the Houseof Commons by a Private Member and down for SecondReading on Friday, March 3, 1^34.As this Bill was not likely to be taken, inview of the Bills referred to in the two precedingConclusions, it was not discussed.

APPENDIX.215TERMS OF GUARANTEE TO BE OFFERED TO THE SHEIKH ANDDHITS OF THE AREA TO 7/HIGH THAT GUARANTEE SHOULD APPLY.Formula agreed to by the Standing Official Sub-Committeefor Questions Concerning the Middle Eastc1- His MajestyTs Government are prepared to givethe Sheikh a guarantee in respect of unprovoked aggression by land in return for the grant by him ofan oil concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company(acting for the Iraq Petroleum Company), but are anxiousto confine it to major aggression, i.e. , to unprovokedattack by the ruler of a neighbouring State, and to major Bedouin raids..      They could not, withoutestablishing a regular defensive system on the frontier,which they cannot contemplate, give an assurance thatin no circumstances would any small hostile force beallowed to cross the Qatar boundary, and they cannot accept liability for meeting minor raids.      Moreover,here, as in Koweit, they would of course expect the sheikh to take reasonable steps for his own defence and for maintaining order within his own borders.If, as His Majesty&apos;s Government hope, a guarantee within these limits will satisfy the Sheikh, they suggestthat it might be in the following terms -&quot;That in theevent of any serious and unprovokedattack His Majesty&apos;s Government will come to his assistance and maintain the independence of hisState&quot;.2* His Majesty&apos;s Government have considered, as analternative, an assurance on the lines of the Koweitformula of 1914, i.e. , that Qatar shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.This seems unlikely to satisfy the Sheikh, since HisMajesty&apos;s Government are already in treaty relations
with him as an independent ruler, while the termprotection&apos;  thus us ed might alarm him by suggesting the idea of a Protectorate.      If, however, the Resident&apos;thinks that the Sheikh would prefer it, either alone or with addition of formula suggested above, he mayuse it so long as it is clearly understood by the sheikh that the assurance of protection does not go beyond the limits specified in paragraph 1 above.3. It would of course be essential to obtain fromthe Sheikh, in return for any guarantee given, thefacilities required by the Royal Air Force to enablethe guarantee to be implemented - i.e. , probably twolanding grounds and freedom of movement for thenecessary British personnel.      We assume that no diffi-culty will arise about this and that the sheikh would be willing to provide, on payment, guards for aerodromes.4. The question of - the precise boundary to beadopted is already under reference to you (see IndiaOffice telegram No. 440 uf 16th February, 1934).Subject to your further views hi;e Majesty&apos;s government consider that the area to which the above guarantee should apply should for the present not be regardedas extending to the south of a line drawn from a point at the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay passing south ofSalwa and of Sakak to the coast immediately north ofthe Khor-al-Odeid inlet.
