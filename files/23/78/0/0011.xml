Tj/pFRlALAir raids precautions .Statement inthe PrimeMinister&apos; sSpeech.(previous reference *.Cabinet- 6-6-64(33), Con-clusion 3.)/f/f.1.    The Prime Minister informed his ssolleagr.esthat he had. been advised that- it was desirable for him to say something on the subject of air raids precautions in his speech on Imperial Defence that afternoon.   As the Cabinet, at the Meeting referredto in the margin, had. decided that in the politicalsituation then existing it would, be inadvisable to.make a detailed statement   he wished to consult hiscolleagues,   He proposed to touch somewhat lightly onthe subject, and he read a draft of what he intendedt o s ay .Some doubts were expressed, as to whether it was really necessary to mention the subject.    In thisconnection the Cabinet, were informed that the arrange-ments had reached a stage at which it was necessaryto consult Local Authorities, and some further leakagewas liable to occur.    It was suggested that it appeared,better to make an announcement that we were proceedingquietly in accordance with a policy started ten years-before, rather than to run the risk of possiblyexaggerated statements in the Press.   A few suggestions were made as to the form, of the statement:    e.g., thatthe Prime Minister should, avoid using the term &quot;Thisis a panic measure&quot; and should rather point out thatit was a continuation of&apos;a policy pursued consistentlyby every Government since the years immediately following the War.^he Prime Minister accepted these suggestions and said that if pressed, to give details he would, make clear that it was not in the public interest to announce details of plans of this kind.
The Oani.net agreed -That the Prime Minister should makea judicious reference to the work ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence on air Raids Precautions in the courseof his speech on Imperial Defence thes ame a ft er no on,
BELGIUM.2, The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported to the Cabinetthat the Belgian ambassador had informed the Foreign Office that the French had made a request to send French Officers to make a reconnaissance of the Belgian Coast from the point ofview of its defence in time of war.   Permission hadbeen given, on the understanding that the reconnaissanceshould be carried out unostentatiously and that theOfficers should wear plain clothes.   This was quitein order, as the French Government had a military agreement with the Belgian Government.   The BelgianGovernment had thought it right to inform the BritishGovernment.    This was not an application for consult a-tion, but the Belgian Ambassador had intimated thathe hoped the Admiralty would be informed.    It seemed likely that he would, mention the matter again.In the course of a short discussion various suggestions were made, including one that if theBelgian Ambassador raised the question again theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs should endeavourto ascertain from him what was his precise intentionin mentioning the matter to the United Kingdom Govern-ment,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, atmatter, to temporize and adopt a strictly non-committalattitude.    In the meanwhile he would make informalthe conclusion oprop os ed.conclusion of the discussion, said that heif the Belgian -Ambassador reopened thheenquiries from:v,e Admiralty as to- what informationwe had on the s ub jiect.

In reply to enquiries, the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs said that the French comments onthe United Fingdom Memorandum on Disarmament, ofJanuary 39th, 1934 (Cmd.4512 (No.4)), which had been promised on the occasion of the Lord Privy Seal&apos;recent visit, had now arrived, and. the Note would bepublished by the French Government before the end ofthe week.    It had been translated and would be circu-lated at once, together with his own report of histalk with the French Ambassador.(See also, following Conclusion.)
IMPERIALoQixcr.(previous reference:Cabinet 10(34),  Con-cius ions2-5.)F-.R..PELGIUM.4. The question op Imperial Defence Policy, raised in the Report of the Defence Requirements Committee(CP.-64 (34)) and CP.-70 (34) was discussed only from the point    of view of procedure.    The particular question raised was as to whether sufficient material was available for a useful continuation of the diseus-sion on Defence Requirements on the following dayas already arranged.There was general agreement that, from the pointof view both of Disarmament and Defence Requirements,the Cabinet ought to take up the linked questions of security, Guarantees, and. Sanctions.    In this connectionattention was drawn to Reports on the subject ofEconomic Sanctions by the Advisory Sub-Committee ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence on Trade questions in Time of War,In reply to a question the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs said, that the Treaty of 1839 guarantee-ing Belgian neutrality was no longer valid.    We had no specific liability   to Belgium other than the generalliability of the Locarno Treaty.mhe Cabinet agreed  To meet, as previousIv arranged, on thefollowing day. THURSDAY, MARCH 22nd,at 11 a.m. at 10 Downing Street, whenthey would consider the questions of security and Sanctions,  for which thefollowing Papers would be available:-Consequences, of a Breakdown of the.

cabinet procedure .detention byfinis ters ofCabinet papers on leavingOffice .(previous reference:Cabinet 8(3?), Con-elusion 1.)ft/?.,and at  (3.0/o.5.    The Cabinet had before them a Most Secret Noteby the Secretary (CP.-69 (34))  covering a Memorandum,by the Deputy Secretary on the question of theretention by Ministers of their Cabinet Papers on leaving office.   Special attention was invited tothe following suggestions made in paragraph 18 ofSir Rupert Howorth&apos;s Memorandum:-(a) That it shall be the duty of all cabinet ministers on vacating office to returnforthwith all Cabinet Minutes and Papersissued to them while in office to theSecretary *-0 the Cabinet:    and it shallbe the duty of the Secretary to theCabinet to recover all such Papersaccordingly:(b) That the same procedure shall be followed in the case of Ministers outside theCabinet on vacating office:(c) That ex-Cabinet&apos; Ministers.- shall continueto have the right of access to all cabinet minutes and Papers issued to them, duringthe time that they were members of theCabinet:(d) That the Secretary to the Cabinet be instructed to invite the represents-tives of deceased ex-Cabinet ministers to return forthwith to the Cabinet Offices-   all post-war Cabinet Minutes and papers in their possession:(e) That the Secretary to the Cabinet be instructed to write to living ex-cabinet ministers inviting them to co-operateby returning their Cabinet Minutes andPapers to the Cabinet Offices, to bekept there in safe custody for them.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thatthe -^ing was in full agreement with CP,  69 (34),A suggestion was made that some difficultymight be encountered in recovering the older papers.It was explained that the Secretary to the cabinet had some experience in the matter as in the days of the War cabinet the rule had been that the secretariat should recover.Cabinet documents.    Thesamerule had applied to documents of the Committeeof Imperial Defence.        No doubt, however,
difficulties must be expected in carrying out thepresent proposals.      The moment, however, was consideredopportune for taking action owing to a recent casein the Law Courts,It was pointed out that the suggestionssummarised above did not appear to cover the caseof members of previous Cabinets who were also membersof the present Cabinet.        This could be met by thesubstitution in paragraph (c) of the words &quot;membersof previous Cabinets&apos;&apos; for &quot;ex-Cabinet Ministers.&apos;1This was agreed to.Subject to this minor alteration the cabinet agreed:-(a) To approve the suggestions summarised above.(b) To authorise the Secretary to put theproposals in operation in the spirit as wellas in the letter and endeavour to recoverall documents from the termination of theWar onwards, other than documents belongingto the present Government which Ministerswished to retain while in office.
I,PHE AHMY AMDIaTR FORCE&quot;&quot; ------ BILL.f(previous&apos; Reference:Cabinet SO(33), Con-elusion 1.)6.    The Cabinet had before their a Memorandum bythe Secretary of state for War (C.P.-79 (34))covering the Army and Air Force (Annual) Bill.Two amendments were proposed.   The first (Clause 4)simplified a detail of administration concerningthe convening of 0ourts-martial when necessary introop-ships:    and the second. (Clause 7) made provisionfor regulating the relations between members of thenew Indian Air Force and members of the militaryforces in India when serving together.   The Memorandumstated that the Bill must receive the Royal Assentby the end. of April and that it might be necessaryto take the Second Reading before Easter.   In thesecircumstances the Secretary of State asked theconcurrence of his colleagues to the immediatecirculation of the Bill.The Cabinet approved the.immediatecirculation of the Bill.-9-
previous reference :Oat-inet 58(25), Con-3ln.sion 3,)7.   The Cabinet, had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries (C.P.-75 (34))on the subject of limit Rentcharge, - a liability onthe owner of agricultural land and. not on the occupier.The considerable increase in the number of occupying-owners, however, had tended to make the matter more of a farmers&apos; problem than, was previously the case,and in certain areas there had been widespread resist-ance to payment of tithe rentcharge.   Re had receiveddeputations from tithe payers and tithe owners, andhad come to the conclusion that from the tithe-payers&apos;point of view there was a case for amending the lawin order to bring relief to hard cases, and. from thetithe owners&apos; point of view there was a case for introducing improved methods of recovery of titherent charge.   The Minister therefore asked authorityto introduce a Bill in the House of Lords to amend.the Tithe Act, 1891, in the following manner:-I     (1) To simplify the procedure under whichremission of tithe rentcharge can beobtained, in particular by saving thetithe payer the expense and troubleof attendance before the County Court.(2) To increase the amount of remissionwhich a tithe payer may obtain, basedon the rental value of the land for thepurpose of Schedule B Income Tax, byaltering the figure of two-thirds to(one-third)  (two-fifths).(3) To provide for automatic remission ofrates on tithe rentcharge proportionate to the remission,) To provide a more modern procedure forrecovering tithe rent charge.J
The Lord Chancellor informed the Cabinet thatthe present procedure in this matter was cumbrousand technical ana led to a failure of the Lav/.    Thenew proposals were a great improvement.The Minister of Agriculture and fisheries said that his proposals would not of course meet thewishes of extremists on either side but would providefor hard cases.      He thought the Government could count on moderate opinion and on Queen Anne&apos;s Bounty.      the farmers&apos; Union also, while not accepting the Bill, would wish to see it passed.        The objections of the titheowners were met to a considerable extent by theadvantage they would derive from the great increasein the legal liabilities of the tithe payers.      In replyto a suggestion that he should consider an alterationof the figure of six-fifteenths referred to in paragraph13 to one half in order to avoid hardships to some titheowners, he explained that the figures in his memorandum had been arrived at only after long enquiry and manyconsultations.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out thatthe effect of paragraph 16 would involve a transferof either  42,000 or  60,000 from the Exchequer tothe rates and this might be objected to by representatives of Local Autnorities.      The explanationsgiven on this point satisfied the Cabinet.The Cabinet agreed:-(a) To approve generally the proposals of theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheriesas set forth in Ce?*  75  (34).(b) That the question should be consideredby the Committee of Home Affairs but neednot be referred again to the cabinet before the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries took action.(c) That the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries should arrange with the Secretaryof State for War, as Leader of the Houseof Lords, whether it would be advisable to introduce the Bill in the House ofLords as he had proposed.
