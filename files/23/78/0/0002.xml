I 32iiuSTRIA. 1. The Cabinet had &quot;before them a Memorandum bylL _ the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(CP.  19 (34)) dealing with the most recent developmentsIberman ThreatIto Austrian of the political situation in Austria.      The Memorandumllndependence.stated that the Austrian Government had approachedIprevious His Majesty&apos;s Government with proposals for aniReference:cabinet 60 (33)    Anglo-Austrian trade agreement which would be both ofI Conclusion l).economic and political assistance to that Government,and that in addition Dr. Dollfuss was threatening to appeal to the League of Nations if German support to national-Socialist agitation in Austria were continued.In the matter of the proposed Trade Agreement theCabinet realised that our circumstances did not permit us to give direct economic assistance to austria.    It was suggested, however, that Italy andFrance might be induced to do more than at present.If Austria, could make a favourable economic arrange-ment with some other European country, such as Poland,the Chancellor of the Exchequer was willing to examinethe possibility of not insisting on our rights underthe most-favoured-nation clause of existing commercial treaties.    mhe Cabinet, however, did not pursue this aspect in the absence of the President of the Boardof Trade.On the political aspect of the question the cabinet took a grave view of the situation in Austria.    Onecomment was that German;/, by means of propaganda,sabotage, economic pressure and bullying was about to gain everything that she would have gained from a successful war.   Dr. Dollfuss&apos;?&apos;  forthcoming appealto the League of Nations might,  it was recognised,subject the League to a most dangerous.test in present
circumstances, particularly in view of uncertainty as to the attitude of Italy .   The Cabinet were reminded, however, that if Germany succeeded in a virtual absorption of Austria she might adopt towardsthe Italian Tyrol the s^me tactics as now in Austria,which would not be pleasant for Italy,    If Italy was found willing to co-operate with other Powers,therefore, there appeared a possibility of presentinga united front in Europe towards Germany on thisquestion.    One suggestion was that, in order toavoid subjecting the league to this strain, resortmight be had to the Pour-Power Pact if the UnitedKingdom, Prance and Italy were agreed that theindependence of Austria was essential to European peace;   but the Cabinet recognised that the Pactwas not yet ratified by all the countries concernedSome discussion took place as to the means avail-able for exerting pressure on Germany if a common front were achieved between the European Powers,and the Minister of Agricf-lture and Fisheries madea forecast of the draft Report on Economic pressure by the League of Nations now under consider-ation by the Advisory Committee on Trade questions in Time of war, of which he is Chairman.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State for Foreignewrhuutecdtfatkctjd \ g-a-as^-ng 2iasfe^the Governments of Francepressure on Austria:^hat if he felt that consultations with some of his Cabinet colleagues were desirable, he should ask thePrime Minister for a Meeting of the ministerial Committee on Disarmament.

REDUCTION and limitation OFARMAMENTS.(previous reference:Cabinet 1 (34)Conclusion 2).2.  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(CP.  10 (34))  covering-a draft despatch to France,Germany and Italy embodying the Disarmament proposalsof His Majesty&apos;s Government in their latest form,prepared in accordance with the Cabinet Conclusionat their last meeting.The Lord President of the Council informed theCabinet that &apos;a draft Despatch had been considered bythe Ministerial Committee on Disarmament for two hours on the previous afternoon.    On the whole,  the ministerial Committee had agreed that the proposal ofthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was thebest course open in the present difficult situation.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat he and. the Lord Privy Seal were hard, at workrevising the draft Despatch in order to introduce anumber of amendments that had been siiggested at theMeeting of the Ministerial Committee on Disarmament.Amonpr these he mentioned that at the end he was intro-ducing a paragraph indicating our understanding thatany agreement resulting from our Despatch would,inter alia, bring Germany back as a Member of theLeague of Nations.    This was a point to which, Mussolini attached great importance.^he Cabinet agreed  (a) That.the dra^t Despatch contained inC.P.-10 (34) should form the basis ofthe Despatch to be sent to Germany,France and. Italy, a? proposed by theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs in 0 .P .-10 (34):(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should have authority to re-draft,send and publish the Despatch at whatevermoment&apos;he deemed most appropriate:(c) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs sheiiid take eve^y possibleprecaution to ensure that none of theGovernments concerned could takeiimbrage at the publication of the
Despatch, bearing in mind theaction taken in order to restrain the French, German and italian governments from publishing theirown documents (F.0, Telegrams ofJanuary 12th, to Rome No.12, ParisNo.3 and Berlin No.5):That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should have authority to consult the membersof the Ministerial Committee on disarmament, separately orcollectively as he might think necessary .
PERSIA. 3.  The Cabinet had before them a Report on anglo-Persian relations by the Standing Ministerial(previous reference: Sub-Committee on questions concerning the Middle Easta, Cabinet 1 (34)^Conclusion 4).     (CP.  18 (34)) prepared a t the request of the cabinet at their last meeting.      The Committee consideredthat a treaty settlement with Persia necessitatedPersian acceptance of the following three points as our minimum requirements:-(a) a definite renunciation of Persia&apos;s claims on Behrein, Tamb, Nabiyu Tamb and Abu Musa;(b) the continuance for not less than 25 yearsof the facilities hitherto available to HisMajesty&apos;s ships at Henjam;(c) an article combining the recognition byPersia of the Arab Rulers of the persian gulf and of the right of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to conduct affairs with the PersianGovernment on behalf of these Rulers;    with anundertaking with regard to non-aggression asbetween Persia on the one hand and HisMajesty&apos;s Government and those Arab Rulerson the other.The Committee recommended that in return for theabove desiderata the following concessions should be offered:-(a) to remit the whole, if need be, of thePersian Governments debt to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment;(b) renunciation by His Majesty&apos;s Government ofany rights to Basidu;(c) to hand over to Persia the Zahedan railway,a line on Persian soil some 60 miles longconnecting with the Indian railway system;and an agreement to work the Indian sectionof the railway on certain specifiedconditions in correspondence with the Persiansection for not less than 5 years.The Committee recommended that His Majesty&apos;minister at Tehran should be instructed:-(a) at once to resume treaty negotiations withthe Persian Government on the lines embodiedfit, in the draft instructions attached to theCommittee&apos;s Report.(b) to report immediately if the negotiations are held up owing to negligence or obstruc-tion on the part of the Persian ministers or their fear of the Shah.The Cabinet approved the Report in cp. 18  (34) summarised above.-5-
INDIA.4.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for India (CP. 16 (34)) recordingPay of Indian that the authority for the present emergency cut of services, Questionof Continuance of Sf0 on the salaries of officers whose pay is protectedEmergency Cut.by statute would expire on the 31st March, 1934,      The(previous reference:Cabinet 6 (33)Conclusion 4).F.R.Government of India&apos;s General Budget estimates for1934-35 foreshadowed a deficit which would not be covered without the continuance of the emergency cutfor a further period.      Further, the Government ofIndia had urged that remission of the cut at thepresent time would arouse intense resentment in India.The Secretary of State had therefore reluctantly cometo the conclusion that the cut must be continued for another year until 31st March, 1935.      Subject to cabinet approval he proposed to introduce a short Billfor this purpose at an early date.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Secretary of State for indian CP. 16 (34) and summarised above,

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byNEGOTIATIONSWITH FOREIGN       the President of the Board of Trade (CP.  22 (34))-COUNTRIES.* which had been circulated as a matter of urgencyPrevious explaining the present situation as regards the FrenchReference:Cabinet 1 (34)    quotas, the latest French proposals having only beenConclusion 9).received on the 21st January.    The Memorandum explained  if(3^-7 that the latest proposals had substantially modifiedthe drastic reductions on import quotas imposed by theFrench authorities earlier in the month;    but the full100% had not been restored in every case , and apartfrom coal the value of our trade affected by thesefailures was estimated at  500,000 per annum.Moreover,  it appeared that the arrangements proposedresulted in serious discrimination actual or potentialagainst British trade in comparison with that ofother importing countries.        It was not quite clear what reduction in the coal quota was contemplated,but in any case a 10% cut had been made and was to bethe subject of negotiation;    this involved about 700,000 a year.The President of the Board of Trade recommendedthat we should inform the French Government that weshould take immediate retaliatory action unless thesituation were altered to our satisfaction withinten days from the date of the intimation.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the President of the Board ofTrade should have authority to takethe retaliatory action mentioned inParagraph 8 of CP.  22 (34) and summarised above;    and(b) That after consultation with the PrimeMinister, the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Secretary of State for So^t^^HAffairs, he should settle the terms of^an Order under Section 12 of the ImportDuties Act imposing special duties on a&apos;suitable range of French goods..-7-

It was amatter on which the Government would have to adopttheyan attitude of some reserve and/could not give thelegal matter and he thought the best plan would toto invite one of the Law Officers of the crown to watch it during the debate.The Lord Chancellor gave an explanation of the objections to the Bill.The Home Secretary informed the Cabinetthat the Bill was only second on the Order paper and that the earlier Bill on the Paper, which was an Electricity Bill, was likely to take some time.The Prime Minister suggested that if one ofthe Law Officers felt it necessary to make a speechit should be rather interrogative in characterasking how the promoters of the Bill proposed thatthe various clauses could be carried out.Tha Cabinet agreed -That the Home Secretary should arrange for one of the Law officers to deal with the Bill in the Houseof Commons on the lines he had proposed^The Home Secretary stated that the BillBill their blessing.The Bill was really a technical

SUDAN. 10*    The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. 14 (34))Italian Libyanand Anglo- on the difficult situation which had arisen withEgyptian Frontier.Italy over the determination of the frontier betweenSiih)^&apos; Italian Libya and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.    Duringthe last three years Italian forces had beenestablishing themselves at the Sarra Well and at ,thesouth-western Owenat Well ,(Ain Doua) in territoryregarded as part of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan? and recent conversations in Pome had revealed the factthat the Italian Government was seeking to makeextensive claims to territory in this region.    in face of these claims instructions had been given forthe occupation of Merga and the eastern Owenat Well(Khakhour Mourr), which are both east of longitudeS50j from the Sudan and Egypt respectively.     TheMemorandum stated that as soon as the limits ofmilitary occupation on each side were determined,the question of the future conduct of the discussionwith the Italians would be considered by theForeign Office.The Secretary of State for War reported thathis Department had received information indicating that an Italian force was on its way to thedistrict referred to above and might reach theOwenat region almost any day.The Cabinet agreed - &apos;(a) that the Standing Ministerial Sub-Committee for Questions concerningthe Middle East should have instruc-tions to keep a close watch on thisquestion.(b) that the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee&apos; of the Committee of Imperial Defence- should be invited at once to furnish a Report on the strategic importanceof the Owenat and Sarra Trianglereferred to in the Repop4^ %AtyuAaMduiu. .-12-

SIR JOHN SIMON said that he die not raisethe question for a decision at the moment but he wished the Cabinet to know that the Austrian situation had become acute.      He feared that Dr. Dollfuss&apos;prospects of surviving were likely to be disappointing.He had banked on the failure of the economic situationin Germany but this had not happened.      Nazi propaganda in Austria was no?/ very serious and it was not improbable that Austria might be the point where germany was going to break out.      The German Ambassador it was true had asked to see him and ha a. told him thatGermany intended no violence, but the Austrian minister had notified the Foreign Office that the austrian government had intercepted stacks of pamphlets and acertain amount of explosives entering Austria fromGermany.       There was, therefore, a prospect of Austriabecoming Nazi and of a union between the two States.The consequences of that might become worse and worse.Italy had not been too helpful over this affair.Some time ago we appealed to 8. Mussolini for joint action but he replied that he would do his best at berlin to restrain the Germans.     This had had no result.Austria was now asking us for a commercial treaty, buthe had had to tell the Austrian Minister that this wasnot much good when Austria was on the point of collapseand there were great difficulties in the way.      TheAustrian Minister had suggested that if it was notIn order to supplement the Cabinet conclusion on this subject, the following note has been prepared onthe discussion on Austria at the request of the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs,
practicable to give some specially favourable tarifftreatment to Austria we might keep the tariff but give it back in some other form. He had rather naivelysuggested that that was sometimes done but of coursehe himself wau^ Jtaj^T to tell the Minister that michthings were not done here. His object in raising the question was to warn the Cabinet.MR.  CHAMBERLAIN suggested it would have agood moral effect if Italy and other countries joinedin some protest to Germany. One suggestion he had heard of for assisting Austria was that we mightacquiesce silently in Poland giving specially favourable treatment to Austria without raising our rights underthe Most-Favoured-Nation Clause.      That might helpbut of course did not go far.MR. THOMAS thought that some comment shouldbe made on Italy&apos;s claim to be the only nation that hadhelped Austria. Would it not be a good thing, he asked, to get it on record that we had tried to getItaly&apos;s co-operation and that Italy had refused?SIR JOHN SIMON said he had received a message from Dr.  Dollfuss recognising the good willwe had shown towards Austria. The trouble was thatwe could do nothing concrete.ICR. THOMAS suggested that we ought to tryfor Italian co-operation now, pointing out :fcfcat  atthe same time that Italy&apos;s separate efforts had beena failure.       He asked if the French could not be induced to do something more.THE PRIME MINISTER said he had only just returned and had hardly had time to turn the matter over in his mind but he felt we ought to face Italyup to the situation.        Gould either she or we contemplate a Nazi Austria?
SIR JOHN SIMON pointed out that with a NaziAustria Germany would virtually become a neighbour ofItaly which had a German population across the borderin the Tyrol.THE PRIMS MINISTER pointed out that Germanystood to gain everything that she could get by means ofa successful war.SIR JOHN SIMON said she was getting it bysuccessful bullying.MR. CHAMBERLAIN asked whether the GermanAustria would repudiate their foreign debts.LORD HAILSHAij! said the Nazis always didand they used the money to pay for war material.MR.  ORMSBY-GORE asked what was  the position vis-a-vis the League of Nations.SIR JOHN SIMON said that the Austrian Governmenthad given formal notice to the German Government four days ago that she would have to consider an appeal tothe League if she got no satisfaction from Germany.If she appealed to the League, it would be a severetest as to what the League could or could not do.Italy would be a little halfhearted.       We should have toask her point blank what she was willing to do.       he did not know what her reply would be. The situation at the League would be very peculiar. Normally,as in the case of the Japanese affair for example,the country indicted was there to answer for itselfbut Hitler refused to come to the League.
Mr THOMAS said that they could only talk about&quot;sanctions&quot; at the League.SIR EINGSLEY WOOD asked whether a Declarationcould be obtained on the Austrian question?SIR JOHN SIMON said that no dotibt the League cculdmake a Declaration.   We ourselves stood for the indepnnd-eneo of Austria.   He himself had said so again and again.the PRIME MINISTER asked what would be the oostif the Austrian affair led to serious consequences?He did not want too much importance attached to hiswords, but it wa? a question to which the cabinet were bcxmd to turn their minds.   If political influencedid not prove sufficient, what would?Mr ORMSBY GORE suggested that our standing back from Prance during Mr Lloyd Georgefs Government had had the effect of weakening our influence.SIR JOHN SIMON thought that this was a case where,in her heart, Italy was opposed to Germany and thereforestood alongside Prance.    It was a case where we mightsecure a common front.Mr THOMAS said it was no use bluffing the Germans,but pxiblic opinion here would not stand a war withGermany .THE PRIMP: MINISTER asked what influence S.mussolini had with Hitler?SIR JOHN SIMON said that S, Mussolini coulddiscourage Hitler*s attitude but could not stop him from action,   Herr Hitler would say  &quot;It is not I, butthe Austriana themselves who are doing this&quot;.   TheAustrian Government at 1 a,m. in the morning had fotinda diplomatic member of the German Legation closetedwith the Nazi leader of the Heimwehr.    In reply toSir Kingsley Wood he recalled that S, Mussolini had said that Italian policy did not go all the way with
Germany, particularly on the Austrian question.   Hethought he had better consider what form of communi-cation should be made to France and Italy at once,in order to show otir interest in the maintenance ofthe independence of Austria.THE PRIME MINISTER said that if Herr Hitlerreplied &quot;&quot;^hese doings are not mine&quot; we might invokethe Four-Power Pact after the other three Powers had declared that the independence of Austria was essentialto the European system.  -SIR JOHN SIMON pointed out that the Four-PowerPact was not yet ratified.Mr CHAMBERLAIN said that if Italy and France wouldeach give something economically to Austria, Dr.DollfusBmight be bolstered up.   This would show Hitler that hewas not master of the situation.Mr ORMSBY GORE suggested that we ought not torefer to the Four-Power Pact when the matter was about to be referred to the Leagxie.THE PRIME MINISTER sai* that, put-ting all cards onthe table, ought the qviestion not really to be keptaway from the League?   We should have the same oldtrouble there with the small Powers as in the case ofthe Japanese difficulties.SIR JOHN GILMOUR said that if we were not gettingeither France or Italy to march, there was nothing elseto be done?    but could we not ask Pranee and Italyif they were willing to consider a boycott, or some action of that kind?Mr ELLIOT said that his Sub-Committee of theCommittee of Imperial Defence were Just finishingtheir Inquiry on the question of a League boycott of Germany,   ^heir conditions were that there wasgrave doiibt as to whether the boycott wotild be effective.
At any rate it would &quot;be very costly to this country.He agreed, however, that if the Powers were unwilling to take sterner measures it would be advisable toconsider action through trade.   His Committee hadtaken as its basis a boycott by all the League Powers,with the co-ftperation of America, but without Russia.Their conclusion was that the sanctions could not be effective without belligerent operations.   For example,at sea, if you did not shoot, a ship would go on tothe German port;    if you did shoot, it was war.&quot;&quot;RE PRIME MINISTER thought we should immediatelyget in touch with Italy and France.   Was it possibleto do more than express our own view of the seriousness of the situation?    Gr had we some proposal to make?If economic alleviation to Austria was sxxggested,could we help, say, with money or timber?Mr CHAMBERLAIN remarked that what we could saywas that if the Austrians could get an economic arrange-ment with other countries, though we had certain rights under most-favoured-nation clauses, we could waivethem for a time.   The Cabinet ought not, however, totake a decision on the subject in the absence of thePresident of the Board of Trade,SIR JOHN SIMON asked if it was possible further to encourage the tourist traffic to Austria?    It was avery pleasant place for a holiday.THE PRIME MINISTER said his information was thatthe attempt to stimulate the tourist industry had notbeen a success, owing to the volume of the normalGerman tourist traffic.Mr ELLIOT recalled the Stresa Conference.SIR JOHN SIMON said that the Austrian situation was a matter of days.
Mr Runciman&apos;s return,SIR JOHN SIMON asked if there was any value inconnecting this question with Disarmament?   He was inclined to think that in addition to the Disarmamentimanifesto there would have to he a private communication-tion to Herr Hitler on certain cognate matters.   we might suggest, for example, that our proposals weremade on the assumption that Germany was not going tomake trouble beyond her boundaries, so as to makeGermany feel that the whole suggestion was biased onthe assumption of German good-neighbourliness,   He i.soproposed to add an assumption that Germany would comeback to the League of Nations, which would meet withS.
