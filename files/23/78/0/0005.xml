AUSTRIA, l, The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs gave the Cabinet a summary of the latest information(Previous from Austria.    Sir Walford Selby had seen Dr DollfussReference:Cabinet 4       on the previous evening and had impressed upon him(34), Con-clusions 4     *he bad effect likely to be produced on Britishand 5.)opinion by the excesses against Socialists,    SuchFTI?.5&quot;o j )^ action as the use of artillery against Socialistdwellings was not likely to assist the AustrianChancellor,   Dr Dollfuss maintained that he wasdemonstrating to the German Nazis that he could keeporder in his own country.   The Italian attitude was still rather dubious,   S. Suvich had observed toSir Eric Drummond that up to the present he believedHis Majesty&apos;s Government were opposed to an appealto the League, and had suggested that if the question was considered at the League the result was likely tobe a German victory.   At the moment, however, theproposed appeal was falling into the background.He drew attention to the statement he had made inthe House of Commons on the previous day, aftercommunication with the Prime Minister and members ofthe Ministerial Committee on Disarmament.    In replyto the Prime Minister he expressed the fear that women and children had been killed by bombardment of workers&apos;dwellings in Vienna.   The &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;Correspondent, who was in touch with the Socialists inVienna, was convinced that the attack on the Rathaushad already been set in motion before the declarationof a general strike.   A statement on Sunday by MajorFey tended to confirm the suggestion that the austrian government had precipitated, the troubles.    there wasno doubt that the Socialists had machine-guns andother weapons,   ^e big difference which these events-1-
made in the situation was that hitherto Dr.Dollfuss had &quot;been considered as standing for anindependent Austria against German encroachment:out now he had become involved in civil strife.The suggestion was made that it would be advisable for the British Government and its representatives abroad to avoid any expressions of opinion about the internal situation.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out that in his statement in the Houseof Commons on the previous day he had made clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government had no intention whatever of interfering in theinternal affairs of another country.
Enquiries were made as to the attitude of Cseoho-Slovakia.The Prime Minister reported that Dr Benes, whom he had seen on the previous day, was terriblydisturbed, at the situation.   Czecho-Slovakia atpresent was harbouring refugees from Rus-s ia, --Germany,Austria and Italy, and wanted to keep them..   Now,however, that she was surrounded by States tinderdictatorships, her difficulties were very great.Added, to this there had been a Cabinet crisis overthe lowering of the value of the currency, and.Dr Benes had reported that the Cabinet had resignedon the previous day.   &quot;he Prime Minister had givenDr Benes a private hint that he attached-importance,in the interests of Europe,^ to the retention as Presitsdent of Dr Masaryk, who was report-ed to liave-a.-d.esireto resign.
PRANCE, 2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.in reply to a question, said he had been given tounderstand by the British Ambassador that the present(previous reference: French Government was likely to succeed in remainingCabinet 4(34), Con-   in office,elusion 3.)
AFGHANISTAN. 3. ^e Cabinet had before them the followingBritish Policy, documents on the subject of British Policy in afghanistan:-I previous reference: A Joint Memorandum by the SecretaryCabinet 50 of State for Foreign Affairs and the(32), Con- Secretary of State for India (0.P.-33elusion 7.) (34)) directing attention to certainimmediate questions addressed to Hisg. ^ Majesty&apos;s Minister at Kabul by theAfghan Government, relative to theattitude of the British Governmentin the event of Russian aggression against Afghanistan.    It was suggestedin the Memorandum that the Chiefs ofStaff Sub-Committee should firstconsider certain of the military aspects of the question as a prelim-inary to the consideration of someof the political problems involved by the Defence of India Sub-Committee:A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor War fC,P.-36 (34)) tracing thepast history of the Afghan problem and. urging his colleagues to reaffirmthe policy accepted by the Cabinet in1928 and. to instruct the Defence ofIndia Sub-Committee to consider, onthat basis and. with the least possible delay, the following specific questions:-(i) Are we going to give the AfghanGovernment an assurance that, inthe event of an unprovoked violation of their northern frontier by Russia,we will give them military assistance?(ii) Are we going to accede to the requestof the Afghan Government for militaryadvice regarding the defence of theirnorthern frontier in general, and. ofthe north road in particular?(iii) Are we going to accede to the Afghanrequest for arros and ammunition, andfor aircraft?A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor India (C,P,-40 (34)) covering a despatch -^rom the Government of india dated February 4th, adducing arguments in support of their recommendation thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government should most seriously consider the question whether, .if they reach the conclusion that military aggression by Russia on Afghan-istan would in the last resort inevitably lead to military support of Afghanistan,it would not be&quot; advisable to inform theAfghan Government accordingly,   ^heSecretary of State suggested that thisquestion also should be referred tothe Defence of India Sub-Committee.
The Secretary of State for India began by re-affirming the policy of successive British Govern-ments for a very long term of years that invasion of afghanistan by Russia would be for us a oasus belli.He recalled the long Inquiry of 1927, the results ofwhich had since been more than once reaffirmed.He had no desire to reopen the previous decision ofpolicy:    the only question that he did want settledwas, - on the assumption that our policy wasunaltered, what action were we to take with theAfghan Government?   Were we to tell them of our policy&apos;?    If so, should it be done publicly orprivately?   Difficult questions were raised by these issues.    If the Afghans were told, they might be stimulated to adopt an anti-Russian policy, and inaddition the pro-Russian elements in Afghanistanmight be stirred into activity.   The form of theannouncement also raised difficulties.   He did not wish to discuss these questions today, because hethought that before the Cabinet took a decision they ought to have the Defence of India Plan examined inthe light of the changes since 1927.   Among these changes he mentioned that the Plan of 1927 assumed that the field of operations would be in the south ,and not in the north of Afghanistan, for the reason that northern Afghanistan was cut off by lack of communications.   The operations would therefore all be south of the Hindu Kush.   Now Russia had developedher road and railway communications in the north, anda road, had been built over the Hindu Fush,   Thatseemed, to indicate the possibility of a field of operations north rather than south of the mountainrange.   That being so, he thoxight it essential that -the new factors in the problem should be examined
by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.   He did not anticipate that the result of such an Inquiry would affect the main policy, but if it was found that our commitment was north rather than south of the Hindu.Kush we might have to be very cautious as to whatwas said to the Afghan Government.    After the Chiefeof Staff Sub-Committee had reported, the cabinet could consider what was to be said to the AfghanGovernment.   He thought possibly the need for greathaste had been exaggerated.   There -was some reason tobelieve that anti-Russian feeling was stronger in afghanistan than we had thought .   The british minister believed that for the moment he couldconfine any discussions to the question of the roadnorth of the Hindu Kush, and if, in discussing that matter, wider issues were raised, he would ask for time.   There was also the question of supplying arms to the Afghans,   There was, however, a certain amountof time available for consideration.   His advice tothe Cabinet, therefore, would be to make no decision as to whether their policy should be announced, or asto the form of the announcement:    that the Chiefs ofStaff Sub-Committee should be asked to report as soonas possible:    and that, when their Report was received,the question should be considered as to whether adecision could be taken by the Cabinet or whether itshould go first to the Defence of India Sub-Committee,He read a draft Terms of Reference to the Chiefs ofStaff Sub-Committee.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs acceptedthe above proposals and asked how long the Inquiryby the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee would take.The Secretary of State for ,Wa.r said he was advised that it would take about a week.    It was only becausethe time required was so short that he could accept
the proposal.    He had. grave doubts as to whether wec,p\ild temporize much, longer with the Afghans withoutdriving them into the arms of Russia, and quoted theGovernment of India in support of that view.   Afterthe lapse of so many years without any announcementof our polio;/ the Afghan Government might well thinkthat we did not mean business.    If, by inaction, weencouraged the Afghans to take sides with Russia, weshould in effect be driving them to do exactly what we wanted, to avoid.   An early decision, therefore,was vital as to what answer was to be given to afghanistan.    He doubted whether the Report of theChiefs of Staff Committee would help much in that question, but if it could be furnished within a very short time he-would not raise objections.The Prime Minister said there need be but little delay.   As soon as he received the Report of theChiefs of Staff Sub-Committee he would again place the question on the Agenda of the Cabinet.     he deprecated the raising of the question of the defenceof the north road if It could be avoided, as it- wasimpossible to foresee what would be the effect of ourraising it on the Afghan mind.   He thought that ifpossible the matter should be allowed to rest for a.fortnight or three weeks, and that it would be betterbefore raising it, to decide the major questions ofpolicy,The Cabinet agreed.  (a) That the Prime Minister should beasked to refer the following question to the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee,with a request that they would submit a Report thereon at a very early date:-&quot;On the assumption that the policyof the Defence of India Committee*sReport of 1928 holds good (C,I.D,Paper No,l58-D   approved by theCommittee of Imperial Defence-at its 252nd Meeting, Conclusion 2),to consider and report&apos; whether any. -8-
new military factors have arisensince that date which would makeit impossible to implement that policy and would invalidate thePlan approved, in. principle, bythe Committee of Imperial defence in 1929 (C,I,D. Paper No.172-D  O.I.D. minute es, 242no&quot; Meet ing ,Conclusion 3.&quot;:(b) That as soon as the Report of theChiefs of Staff Sub-Committee is received, the question should again be placed on the Agenda of the cabinet with a view to an early decision as tothe instructions to be&apos; given to theBritish Minister at Kabul:(c). That in the meantime the british minister at Kabul should be informedthat the Government hoped to send himspecific instructions within a fort-night on the larger issues raised inthe Papers before the Cabinet:   that if,before the receipt of these instructions,the question of the defence of the hindu Kush road was raised, by the AfghanGovernment, he should have discretion to discuss the matter;   but that theGovernment would, prefer, if possible,that it was not raised before he received his general instructions.(d) That the Secretary of State for India-should send to the President of theBoard of Education the various telegramsreferred to in the Papers before theCabinet, and before the question was again discussed by the Cabinet heshould consider whether it was desirableto circulate any of these telegrams more generally.
REDUCTION AND 4, The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and LIMITATIONOF ARMAMENTS,   reported that, in accordance with recent announcementsIn Parliament, the Lord Privy Seal would visit Paris,(previous reference:       arriving the^e on Friday next, February 16th, with cabinet 4(34), Con-       the assent of the French Government,   After thatelusion 9.)he would proceed to Berlin, and he hoped to seeP Rb(3k)k Herr Hitler on Monday, February 19th.   He would then proceed to Rome, perhaps stopping in Paris en. route toLondon./ It was in connection with that programme thatMr Arthur Henderson had postponed the meeting of the bureau of the Disarmament Conference until April 9th.The prospects on disarmament were not good,   ^herewere four points on which the German Government wereopposing our suggestions, and four points onwhich the French opposed them.&quot;he Cabinet agreed.  That the Ministerial Committee on disarmament should meet on thefoil owing day, before the departure of the Lord Privy Seal.(NOTE:    A Meeting has been arranged for thursday, February 15th, at11,30 a&apos;.m.)
5. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe President of the Board of Education (C,P.-37(34)) on the subject of Future Educational Policy,in which he set forth certain problems, -which mightbe of political importance and likely to call forGovernment decision and possible action before long,andon which he sought the advice of his colleagues.L-Jo immediate decision was asked for, and thePresident, suggested that a few of his colleaguesmight be invited to consider the issues involved,with a view to reporting their conclusions to theCabinet at a later date.After hearing a statement by the President ofthe Board of Education, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows -The Lord President o^ the Council(In the Chair),The President of the Board ofEducation,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of state for War,The Secretary of State for Scotland,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Labour,:&quot;&apos;he Postmaster-Genei^al. -should consider Educational policy on the basis of CP,-37 (34) andreport in due course to the Cabinet:(b) That it should be understood that theCabinet Ministers mentioned in (a)could be represented by their Depart-mental Under-Secretaries if they were unable to be present themselves/:(c) That the President of the Board, ofEducation should, in addition, beallowed to invite the parliamentary under-Secretary of the Board toattend the meetings of the Committee.
THE COTTON 6. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by trade&quot; the Minister of Labour (CP.-30 (34)) in which he(Previous placed before his colleagues the desire of the CottonReference: ,Cabinet 3 Spinners&apos; and Manufacturers&apos; Association and theclusion0g60)     Weavers&apos; Amalgamation that legislative action shouldPA be taken to make agreed working conditions binding (314)1&apos;- throughout the Manufacturing Section of the CottonIndustry.    In the course of his Memorandum theMinister stated that if a simple method could befound of enabling agreed rates to be given effect byOrder in this section of the cotton industry, therewas a case for acceding to the request of the organ- .isations .     Although general legislation of this character had hitherto been opposed by employers&apos;and workers&apos;  organisations in the majority ofindustries, in this case he understood that neitherthe National Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisationsnor the ^rade Union Congress would o^fer opposition.In the course of a statement on the issues raised in his Memorandum, the Minister of Labourlaid, emphasis on the urgency of an early decision:otherwise there might be very serious trouble inLancashire in the near future.During the discussion reference was made to theprobable reactions on other industries of legislation passed in connection with the Cotton Trade.   TheCabinet were reminded also that Trade UnionCongresses had usually rejected similar proposals and that there was lack of unanimity inside theTrades Unions on the subject.   The agreementsaffected were not confined only to wages, but alsoto the organisation of the industry.   An analogous&amp;(s&apos;5)%       case was that of the Iron and Steel Trade, where anagreement with a majority of employers and employedwas probable, though some of the most progressive-12-
elements might stand out.,.   The question ofpenalties or sanctions was also likely to raisedifficulties.     If the Government undertook thatan agreement was to be enforced, it was suggestedthat they would be taking some responsibility forthe agreement itself.nhe Cabinot agreed -(a) That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows -Tlie Minister of Labour (in the Chair),The Secretary of State for- DominionAffairsThe Secretary of State for Air,The President of the Board of Trade,&quot;Tie Minister of Agriculture andFisheries,&quot;he First Commissioner of Works -should consider the questions raised in C.P.-30 (34) and report to theCabinet:(b) That the President of the Boardof Trade should, be authorised to invite the Secretary for Minesto meetings at which Coal questions were likely to be raised., or tosend, him as a substitute if he was unable to be present in person:(c) That Wiotiees of Meetings should besent to the Prime Minister, lesthe should wish to attend:(d) That meetings should begin at theear1iest possib1e date.
londonpassengertransport.Electrifica-tion of Sub-urban railway lines inBast London,and Extensionof central london TubeRailway.(previous reference:Cabinet 1 (33)Conclusion 1).7.    The cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of the electrification ofsuburban railway lines in East London and anextension of the Central London Tube Railway:-A Memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (CP.  38 (34)) reporting on a Memorandum he had received fromthe Standing Joint Committee of theLondon Passenger Transport Board andthe Main Line Railway Companies on thequestion of affording additional-  facilities in North and East London^While the three schemes/proposed by theJoint Committee were regarded by them as an indivisible whole,  two out ofthe three would not become fullyremunerative for a number of yearsafter completion.      Despite theadmitted urgency of providing additionaltravelling facilities in the area inquestion the Minister was satisfiedthat until the financial prospects ofthe London Pool showed signs of definite improvement neither the Boardnor the Main Line Companies were likelyto embark on capital expenditure not expected to be immediately remunerative.If, therefore,  the Government desiredto  press the parties to proceed withelectrification and aearly date they must,consider whether theyauthorise an offer ofnew tube at an increase his opinion,are prepared tosome financialassistance by the Government.A Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP. 42 (34)) pointing outthat, although he was in entire agree-ment as to the desirability or theseproposalss he was unable to find any grounds on which Exchequer assistance towards the cost of carrying out theworks could be justified.drifter considerable discussion the Cabinet(a)    That the Minister of Transport shouldbe authorised to inform the StandingJoint Committee of the london passenger Transport Board and the MainLine Railway Companies that theGovernment were deeply disappointedat the result of their examinationof the question of affording additional facilities in North and East London.He should make it quite clear that in no circumstances were the Governmentprepared to make a grant of financialassistance to these projects.      He
should also refer to the pledges toprovide necessary transport facilitiesgiven by the transport interests concernedwhen the London Passenger Transport bill had been before Parliament and which hadbeen an essential element in securingits passage through both Houses;To accept the proposal of the Minister ofTransport tnat he should discuss theterms of his letter with the Chancellorof the Exchequer.

Mr Colijn wished to reply to the effectthat Holland was prepared for three months to givethe United Kingdom the same quotas which had been allotted up to the present, during which timeHolland desired to negotiate with us a commercial agreement to cover a longer period, say a year,with the object of increasing the trade betweenthe two countries,   He had asked if this suggestion would be sympathetically received by the BritishGovernment,    ^he President had informed him that he must consult his colleagues before undertaking to embark on negotiations.    In his Memorandum thePresident pointed out that the proposal necessarilyimplied, pending the negotiations, the holding up ofthe recommendation of the Import Duties AdvisoryCommittee that the duty on cut flowers should beraised from 9d. per lb, to Is.3d, per lb.In the course of a short discussion theCabinet were reminded that the Dutch had behaved-very fairly to us in commercial matters.
