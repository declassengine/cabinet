THE KING OP 1.    The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thatTHE BELGIANS.___ a Memorial Service to the late King of the BelgiansMemorial would be held in Westminster Abbey on the morrowService to.at 12 Noon, at which the King and Queen would be present.      He said that the King had requested thatthe Cabinet should be there.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs wereexcused,  on the ground that they had important political engagements in the country which it was too late to postpone.      The former stated that hewould be present at the Memorial Service at WestminsterCathedral.      The Postmaster-General was also excusedattendance, as he had an official engagement in thecountry.In consequence of the above the Meeting of theCabinet Committee on Educational Policy, which hadbeen arranged for 11 a.m.  on Thursday, February 22nd,was postponed until Thursday, March 1st, at II.a.anat the Treasury Board Room.
COMMITTEE OFHOME AFFAIRS.Attendance ofMembers at.(previous reference:Cabinet 5(34),  C on-clusion 13.)S. The Prime Minister said he had been examining the Minutes of the Committee of Home Affairs andhad observed a great falling off in the attendance of its members as well as of other Cabinet Ministerswhose business was being considered at the CommitteeHe made an appeal to his colleagues to attend moreregularly, and pointed out that when the Minutes ofthe Committee came before the Cabinet they wereusually passed, under somewhat rapid review as it was assumed that the members of the Cabinet mainly concerned wot!Id have been present.-s-
fffl PERSIANGULP.Oil Conces-sions inQatar.proposed guarantee o:protection to Sheikh.(previous reference:Cabinet 50(53), Con-elusion 3,)7(34)2.3, The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for India (C.P.-49 (34))circulating for the information of his colleaguesa Report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee of theCommittee of Imperial Defence on the subject of aproposal to guarantee protection to the Sheikh ofQatar.   The conclusions reached by the Chiefs of StaTfwere as follows:-(l)(a) That the principle of endeavouring tosecure the Qatar oil concession for a company registered in Great Britain isin the best interests of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.(b). That as a preliminary to any guarantee of protection, the boundary of Qatarshould, be decided upon.(c) That aryt guarantee&apos; given should be framed in more general terms thanthose at present proposed.(d) That  it should be made clear that theguarantee applies only to unprovoked aggression, and that the Sheikh must take reasonable steps for his ownprotection and for the safety of Britishand foreign personnel.(e) That a landing ground, with the necessarystorage facilities, should be provided in Qatar, and that&apos;an adequate system of intelligence should be instituted.(S) We consider that, subject to the above safe-guards, the commitment can, if necessary,be fulfilled, and that there is no objec-tion to a suitably   qualified, assurance being given to the Sheikh.The secretary of State was in general agreement withthe above conclusions, save on two points:-(i) The terms of the guarantee to be givento the Sheikh, of Qatar (paragraph 5), and(ii) The caveat suggested by the Chiefs of staffin the event of oil not being found(paragraph 11), viz-,to the effect thatour guarantee of protection is dependentupon oil being found and the concessiontaken up and worked within some limitedt ime.After stating his reasons the Secretary of Statesubmitted the following course of action for theconsideration of his colleagues
(a) That instructions should immediately be sent to the Political Resident inthe Persian Gulf to initiate negotia-tions with the Sheikh of Qatar on lines which have already been agreedinterdepartmentallyi   that he should further be informed that His Malesty&apos;sGovernment accept the principle of-protection, but that the precise termsof the guarantee to be given are under examination, and that in these circurn-stances he should endeavour&apos; (as he has suggested) to lead the Sheikh to raisethe question of protection himself, and,if and when the Sheikh does, so, inform him that the issue raised is one of such importance that the instructions of HisMajesty&apos;s Government must he taken upon it.   This will give us time to reach agreement here interdepartmentally onthe terms and nature of our guarantee,while avoiding any delay in the initiative-tion of general discussions between the resident and the Sh e ikh,(b) That the precise terms of the guarantee to be given and the reference, if any,to be made to a caveat in the event of oil not being found should form thesubject of discussion between theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs and the Secretary of State for India,with a view to instructions being sentin svoh terms as they may, after furtherconsideration, consider suitable, theterms of any such instructions to be circulated in due course for information to the Committee of Imperial Defence.The Secretary of State for India gave the cabinet a summary of the question, in the course of which-he pointed out that the commitment involved was less serious than it seemed at first sight, since Ton Saudwas already committed, by his Treaties with us torecognise the special Treaty relations of His Majesty*salreadyGovernment with the Sheikh of Qatar4 and we/had aTreaty with the Sheikh guaranteeing him against attack by sea, with a&apos;promise of good, offices if he was attacked by land.   Referring to (b) above, he proposedthat the precise terms of the guarantee should bediscussed not only between the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and himself, as he had already suggested, but also with the Secretary of state forAir, and, if he so desired, the Secretary of Statefor War,
The Prime Minister said that he had studied notonly the Report&apos; of the Chiefs of Staff committee but the Minutes of their 118th Meeting, at which thesubject had been discussed.   Prom these he derivedthe impression that the commitment was rather larger than the Secretary of State for India had indicated.In the Minutes of the Committee, for example, he found the Chief of the Imperial General Staff speakingof it as &quot;a guarantee which might, have far-reachingreactions&quot;.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggestedthat the inference to be drawn from paragraphs 5 and10 of the Report of the Chiefs of Staff Committee wasthat for the first time we were proposing to give aguarantee to the Sheikh against the depredations ofIbn Saud,    He recalled, however, that by the Treatyof Jed da&apos;.   Ibn Saud bound, himself to recognise our special Treaty relations with Qatar and to maintaingood relations with the Sheikh.   He understood that between Ibn Saud&apos;s territory and that of Qatar therewas a &quot;no-man&apos;s-land&quot; inhabited by nomadic tribesand that it was primarily against these people thatthe Sheikh wanted a guarantee.   He pointed out alsothat by giving the guarantee we should justify the sheikh in awarding the oil concession to the Anglo-Persian Company on the ground that he would, beobtaining something from us that he could not obtain from anyone else, namely, protection.   That would bea much better reason to give to the Americans thansaying that the Sheikh had preferred the Anglo-persian oil Company.The Secretary of State for Air pointed out thatthe Royal Air Force was liable to be called in if the sheikh got into difficulties, and that was why they
wanted the agreement carefully arranged.   the arabian side of the Persian Gulf had now acquired amuch greater importance to us than formerly, owingto the development, of the air route there.The Prime Minister thought that the commitmentwas at present rather vague.   Referring again tothe Minutes of the Chiefs of Staff Committee he saidthat again and again he found it contemplated thatprotection might be necessary against Ton Saud.There seemed to be a possibility that in time l&apos;bnSaud might become much more formidable than atpresent .The Secretary of State for India pointed out that even if the Americans obtained the oil concessionwe should become involved in a commitment as itwould be very inconvenient to have the Americanstaking precautionary measures in this region.The President of the Board of Education pointedout that if at any time in the last five yearsIbn Saud had attacked any Sheikh we should have hadto intervene.The Prime Minister pointed out. that hitherto nopreparations had been necessary.   Now, however, theReport of the Chiefs of Staff Committee advised thata landing-ground and the necessary storage facilities should be provided in Qatar and that an adequatesystem of intelligence should be instituted.   Thisemphasised, his general impression that the Chiefsof Staff took the commitment rather more seriouslythan the Secretaries of State for India and ForeignAffairs.The Secretary of State for War said he could not agree that this was not an important commitment.In his original&apos;Paper the Secretary of State forIndia had referred to it as such.   The Jedda&quot;1  Treaty
with Ibn Sand, to which the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs had referred, did not place usunder any obligation to take action to assist the sheikh of Qatar.   The only definite obligation wehad had in the past was defence against attack by sea, and. good offices in case of attack by land.There were two kinds of obligation that had to beconsidered:    (l) the case where Ibn Saud broke theTreaty of Jeddaj , which would involve us all overthe Arabian Peninsula:    and. (2) raids by wanderingBedouins.   He quoted paragraph 7 of the Chiefs ofStaff Report:-&quot;It is obviously impracticable to guarantee protection, either tothe Sheikh&apos;s subjects or even tothe oilfields, against the sporadicraiding which we understand, isendemic in this region&quot;,after which the Report recommended that the Sheikhshould, be informed that he was responsible for lawand order and for providing the necessary means todefend the oil installations.   Consequently it seemed either that we were undertaking an obligationthat we could not fulfil or that It was a very important commitment.   He admitted that it might benecessary to undertake it, but we ought to considerthe question very carefully before landing ourselves with the possibility of a war extending throughoutthe Arabian Peninsula.The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attentionto paragraph 12 of the Chiefs of Staff Report, wherethey presumed that &quot;the proposed commitment willnot be entered into without prior consideration atthe Committee of Imperial Defence&quot;.   He thoughtthat course should be followed.The secretary of State for India deprecated anyfurther delay.    It was important to send instruc-tions to the Resident in order to forestall the americans.
The Secretary of State for Air pointed, out thatour commitments were there whether we wanted them ornot.    If Ibn Saud took action against any of theSheikhs we had got to take action.   Bahrein was animportant example.The suggestion was made that Ibn Saud was not likely to interfere actively on the Persian Gulfas he was more preoccupied with Western Arabia.The Prime Minister, referring again to theMinutes of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, said thatin the discussion the desirability of the question being considered by the Committee of Imperial defence had been strongly emphasised.   He thought that thiscourse ought to be followed and that there need notbe any serious delay. .The Cabinet agreed.  That the questions raised in C,P,-4Q(54) should be referred, to theCommittee of Imperial Defence, whichwould meet on Thursday, February 22nd,at the House of Commons, at 5*30 p.ra.
REDUCTION AND   &apos; 4. The question of Reduction and Limitation of limitation of armaments,     Armaments was not discussed.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said(previous reference: that he had just received a Despatch from Mr Eden,Cabinet  5 x(34), Con-   at Berlin,conclusion ion 4,)5 See Sir E, Phipps&apos; melegram No,77,dated February 21,  19 34,
5. i*h&apos;e Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of Slum Clearance andHous ing:-A. Memorandum bv the Minister ofHealth (C .P.-12 ( 34)):A Memorandum bv the Secretary ofState for Scotland &apos;0.P.-34 &quot;(34)):The Report of a Cabinet Committee(C.P.-46 (34)).The first two of the above documents had been before the Cabinet at the Meeting referred to inthe margin, and the recommendations submitted by theCabinet Committee then appointed are as follows(a) That, subject as stated in (b) below,general approval in principle should begiven to the various Housing Policyproposals set out in the Minister ofHealth&apos;s Memorandum (C.P.-12 (34)).(b) That as regards  &quot;overcrowding andredevelopment&quot; the offer of financialassistance from the Exoheouer should be strictly limited to cases where therehousing is effected on or near thecentral site by means of blocks of flatsand should not be given in cases wherethe rehousing is effected by means of ordinary small houses erected onundeveloped land on the outskirts ofthe area, of the local authority.(c) That as regards Scotland it should berecognised that some modification inthe Minister of Health&apos;s proposals willbe necessary to meet the special housingcircumstances in that country.(d) That the Minister of Health and theSecretary of State for Scotland shouldbe authorised to open negotiations forth-with with, the local authorities in Englandand Wales and Scotland respectively on thebasis of the proposals as approved by theCabinet.(e) That in order to ensure the most satis-factory outcome of the discussions withthe local authorities it is desirable thatas little publicity as possible should begiven to the Government&apos;s new proposalspending the results of those discussions.(f) That after the conclusion of the discussions with the local authorities the Minister ofHealth and the Secretary of state forScotland, in consultation with the Chan-cell or of the Exchequer, should prepare and circulate to the Committee (which shouldbe kept in being for the purpose) detailedfinal proposals with a view to the Committeesubmitting a report thereon to the Cabinet.
At an early stage of the discuss -on a-gr^eeHvertt &quot;wasreached on the following points(1) That no attempt should be made topass a Bill through parliament before the August Recess t    theearliest time for a Bill was theautumn.(2) nhat a Memorandum should be preparedby the Minister of Health setting forth in outline the intentions ofthe Government with a view to publication at the appropriate moment.Some discussion took place as to when theappropriate moment would arrive.It transpired that the first stage of the proceed-trigs in regard to the Bill Involved discussions withselected representatives of local authorities, duringwhich leakage was not likely to arise.   The second stage involved discussions with the Associations ofLocal Authorities, and it would be necessary toprepare a Memorandum for their use.   As leakage was likely to. occur at that stage (a somewhat prolongedstage) there appeared to be advantages in publishing the Memorandum then.    On the other hand it was pointedout that, after the general scheme was published,opposition would develop from one side against -details, and from the other side there would be ademand for the Bill to be produced.   Moreover, theBudge4- would have to be taken early in April, andthat would tend to draw public attention away fromthe Housing Memorandum.In favour of early publication the Cabinet were informed that a Motion on Housing was down for dis-cuss ion in the House of Lords on March 21st.   Owingto certain misunderstandings there had been in theautumn a rather bad Debate, from the Government*spoint of view, on the question of housing.    If theGovernment representatives had to get up and. say nothing on the occasion of the forthcoming Debatethey would be in a position of great embarrassment,
The Prime Minister thought that the precisetime for the publication of the statement might beleft over for the present.   He said there was agreat demand for the creation of a Housing Pepart-ment, and he was considering the possibility of creating some kind of Sub-Department, with aseparate Minister, comparable to the Secretary for mines.    If he were able to make that announcement in a week or two it might enable the Government to postpone the publication of their larger schemesfor a time.At the end of the discussion the First Commis-sloner of Works asked whether anything was being done by the Ministry of Health on the technical sideof the construction of new blocks of flats.   It hadbeen stated that some of the Borough Architects were rather old-fashioned and that these constructionswere consequently very expensive.   A new techniquewas involved.- mhe Minister of Health agreed.   His department was examining the questions and obtaining technicalmaterial on the subject.   He would welcome any assistance that the Office of Works could give him.At present a good deal of information was being obtained from abroad.The Prime Minister said there would be nopopularity for houses let at 10/- a week or above:they must be cheaper,The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the recommendations ofthe Cabinet Committee as stimmarisedabove:(b) That the Bill arising out of these recommendations should not be intro-duced before the August Recess:(e) That the decision as to the time   of publication of a Memorandum setting
forth the Government * s intentionsshould he postponed, for the moment,but that a Memorandum should beprepared:(d) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should be a memberof the Housing Policy Committee.
PRODUCE MARKETS     6.  The Cabinet had before them a Report by theSITUATION,Produce Markets Supply Committee on the If ilk and milk and Milk f    ^Products.        Milk Products Situation (C.P.-47 (34)), containing the following recommendations:-(l) A price-security arrangement to ensure,by means of repayable advances from theExchequer, minimum returns to the english and Scottish Milk Marketing Boards inrespect of milk manufactured in factoriessind into cheese on farms.(S) The provision from public funds of asrm not exceeding  750,000, spread, overthe next four years, for the purpose of launching an efficient campaign forsecuring a purer milk supply.    It willbe the responsibility of the Boards tocontinue the campaign as soon as theyare in a position to do so.(3) A contribution from the Exchequer on a  for   basis to a Milk Publicity fund for a period, of two years .    It is unlikelythat the contribution from, the exchequer would exceed       million in the first year, and it should be limited to  ifmillion in any year, according to theamount contributed by the Milk marketing boards:    the grant to be contingent onthe submission of an approved programmecontaining, inter alia, provision for thesupply of milk to schools at reducedrates .The Committee emphasised that these proposals weremade to meet the immediate needs of the situation,on the assumption that the Milk Marketing boards should be   or as quickly as possible should becomeself-supporting.   The Report stated that legislation would be necessary to give effect to the above reeom-mendations, and. suggested that the Cabinet should givauthority for a statement to be made on the subject by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries in theHouse of Commons on Thursday, February 32nd.(previous reference:Cabinet 70(33), Con-elusion 10.)
The Lord President of the Council,referring to his note covering CP.  47 (34), said that theSecretary of State for Scotland considered that theconsumption of milk was much lower than it would be after a campaign to increase milk consumption.Consequently, he wished to use rather cautious languageas to the possibility of controlling over-production.That is to say, in place of the following last sentence of paragraph 8 of CP. 47 (34):&quot;We also attach considerable importance to therecommendation in paragraph 21 of the Report&quot;(i. e,  on the possibility of controlling overproduction), he wished to state:&quot;We note the recommendation in paragraph 21of the Report that very careful considerationt5 &quot;t c * * * *The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries saidthat it was only a point of emphasis but otherwisewas one of relatively small importance.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought it was more than a point of emphasis.      If there was overproduction of milk more financial assistance would berequired for the industry.      On political grounds he wanted to avoid tne suggestion that all agriculturalschemes in their initial stages were not supposed to cost money, but in their later stages requiredfinancial assistance.      He agreed, however, that therewould be some time before we should use as much milkin this country as was likely to be produced.The Lord President of the Council said that noother member of the Committee had objected to paragraph the President of the Board of Education ,referrin,to paragraphs 16 and 17 of Sir Horace Wilson&apos;s report,suggested that if and when legislation was being drawnup it would be worth considering whether localauthorities should not be empowered to buy milk.-15-
At present such authorities had the option to do soitonly in cases where without/the    children wouldnot obtain sufficient benefit from their education.He thought powers might with advantage be given tolocal authorities to buy milk to be suppliedespecially to the children of parents who could not afford to buy it themselves.The Minister of agriculture and Fisheries saidthat this was a point that would arise if and whenlegislation was being drafted and he would keep it inmind.The same applied to points raised by the Ministerof Health as to the importance of consulting theMinistry in connection with the cleaning up of herds.The Cabinet were reminded that consultationwith other Departments was provided for in paragraph 11of the Cabinet Committee&apos;s Report,The President of the Board of Trade pointed outthat the milk industry was not the only industry that was suffering from depression.      He hoped that other depressed industries would be given facilitiesfor publicity at Government expense, and that theproposals now under consideration would become a precedent for considering the requirements of other trades.The Cabinet agreed: ;(a) To approve the Report of the ProduceMarkets Supply Committee on the milk and milk products situation (CP.47 (34)).(b) To authorise the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries to make a statementoutlining the proposals in the House ofCommons on Thursday, 22nd February.(c) To take note that the Minister ofagriculture and Fisheries would consult the Chancellor of the Exchequer andother colleagues about the terms of his statement.-16-
THE CENTRALELECTRICITYBOARD .ProposedAmendmentsto electricity(Supply) Aet1926.(previous reference:Cabinet 1(34), Con-elusion 13.)FA,l(34)H.7.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Transport (C.P.-45 (34)) pointing outthat, if the operations of the Central electricity board were not to be unduly hampered, certain araend-ments of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1926, were required.    He asked authority, in particular, to announce that the Government would introduce general legislation this Session to validate existing or futurespecial arrangements   now recognised to be ultravires   made with the undertakers owning, certaingenerating stations, for the control of the stations and the interchange of supplies between the systems ofsuch undertakers and the National Grid.   The Ministeralso desired, to include in the Bill provisions to legalise the action of the Board with regard to specialprices for exceptional supplies,    to give effect tothe recommendation in the Report of the Committee onMain Line Railway Electrification that the Board, shouldbe given power to afford direct supplies for railway .electrification schemes;    and to amend Section IS ofthe Act of 1926 to enable the Electricity Commissioners,in determining the prices to be charged for suppliesof electricity passed on in bulk from one authorisedundertaker to another, to pool the cost of the wholeor large part of the transmission systems of certainPower Companies and to divide it between the varioustakers of the supply.
Discussion turned mainly on the questionof whether it would he possible to carry legislation in the present session of Parliament in view of the congested programme of business,The Minister of Transport pointed out that aprivate Bill validating some special arrangementswas down for discussion the following week.      He wouldbe bound to speak on that Bill and if he were to saythat existing arrangements were ultra vireswithout announcing validating legislation, thesituation would be --very difficult.After a short discussion with the Minister ofTransport,  the Cabinet agreed:-(a) To approve the proposals in the Ministerof Transport&apos;s Memorandum, CP. 45 (34).(b) That the Bill amending the Electricity(Supply; Act, 1926, should be introduced in the House of Lords.(c) That the Minister of Transport should have authority to announce that the Governmentwould introduce general legislation this session to validate existing or futurespecial arrangements - now recognised tobe ultra vires - as mentioned above, but.that before doing so he should make all arrangements with the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury for the intro-duction of the Bill in the House of lords and its inclusion in the Governmentstime-table in the House of Commons.

His Lordship had thendrafted this Bill.
