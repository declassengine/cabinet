ROAD TRARFTCLad Acci-Bents*$previousj Reference:[cabinet 1I (34), Gon-elusion 10.)1. The Cabinet had before there a Memorandum bythe Minister of Trans port (CP.-71 (34)) on thesubject of Road Accidents, recalling that at theMeeting mentioned in the margin the Cabinet had authorised the preparation of a Bill on the linesOf his Memorandum C .P.-312 (33) subject to furtherconsideration of the definition of a &quot;built-up area&quot; (as one where a system of street lightingis provided) for the purpose of applying a speed limit to private cars and motor-cycles.   The Ministernow asked authority to include in the draft Billprovisions to empower highway authorities (and himself) to take out o^ the new speed restrictioncertain stretches of road in particular areas whichare lit by street lighting although not &quot;built-up&quot;:and to declare streets to be &quot;built-up&quot; althotighthere is no system of public street lighting, inorder to meet, the case of unlighted villages on important roads .The Minister of Transport mentioned that thePresident of the Board, of ^rade had agreed to theabove proposal.Some discussion took place as to whether- the definition would not be rather hard on motorists,and various suggestions were made, such as that the lighting-standards in &quot;built-up areas&quot; or on the borders of those areas might have some distinctivemarking or colouring to enable motorists to recognisethat a speed-limit was in force.   Generally speaking,however, the unanimous view of the Cabinet was thatthese measures were desirable in order to put acheck on reckless driving.
The Cabinet agreed  -(a) To approve the proposals of theMinister of Transport as set forthabovet(b) &quot;That the &quot;Bill should be submitted for examination by the Committeeof Home Affairs before coming backto the Cabinet.
REDUCTION AND 2*  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byLIMITATION OF .,ARMAMENTS. - the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C .P.-68m^e Disarmament &apos;    (54)) analysing some of the external and politicalConference.  consequences which might be expected to follow theConsequences0f a Break- probable breakdown of the Disarmament Conference,down.If his colleagues accepted his estimate of these(in para.7)(Previous results, the Secretary of State invited them/to reference:Cabinet 6 agree that the return to pre-war conditions of(34). Con-conclusion 4.) competitive re-armament involved consequences tothis country of so serious a character that it wasnecessary to examine the objections taken to therecent British Memorandum with a view to seeing whether, by further concession and by additionalundertakings, there was any means of bringing aboutagreement.    He did not conceal his own view thatthis could only be done by meeting, more fully than we had yet done, French demands for security.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairspreceded the discussion of his Memorandum byreporting that Prince Bismarck had informed theForeign Office on the previous evening that theGerman Government had decided to send at onoe a reply to the last French Note.   This had beenprecipitated, he had added, by the publication atGeneva of certain communications by the FrenchGovernment to Mr Henderson.   The German reply hadbeen sent to the French Government on the previous evening, but was not to be published, at present.It was stated, to be conciliatory in terms so far asthe British Government were concerned.   We wereexpecting the French reply to. the British proposals by the end of the present week, unless this newGerman Note should, cause further delay.   Uhfortu-nately the position was so nebulous that not muchcould be said in the Debate.in the House of commons the same afternoon.
The Prime Minister anticipated that the Debatemight not occupy the whole day, and. in ease that should  happen     he had made arrangements for theHouse of Commons to take other business.   He invited the particular attention of his colleagues to areoo^f of a conversation which the Belgian Ambassadors-dor in Berlin had held, with the German Chancellor(Sir E. Phipps&apos; telegram No.90, of Merch 12th)which was both interesting and important.Tn connection with his Memorandum the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs called attention inparticular to the statement in paragraph 7, whichis quoted in the summary at the head of this Minute.He was particularly anxious that the Cabinet should,not lose sight of this point, although he admitted that until the French reply came to hand, the cabinet had not all the material for- a decision on their-disarmament policv.Subject to this the Cabinet agreed  To postpone for the moment furtherconsideration of 0.P.-68 (34), which,it was suggested, might be considered at the appropriate stage of the dis-cuss ion on Imperial Defence Policy,unless circumstances necessitated, it being taken up earlier.

In addition to the documents on the subjectof British Policy in Afghanistan which were beforethe Cabinet at the Meeting, referred to in the margin,via.,A Joint Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for India (CP.-33(34)),A. Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for War (CP.-36 (34)): andA Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for India (CP.-40 (34)),the Cabinet had under consideration the following papers:-A Report by the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee of the Committee ofImperial Defence (CP.-54 (34))stating that in the light of their examination of the developments and changes which had occhirred since 1938they -were of the opinion that no military factors had arisen since that date which would, make it impos-sible to   implement the policy laiddown, or which would invalidate thePlan approved in principle by theCommittee of Imperial Defence in 1929(CCD. Paper No.172-D, and. CCD.Minutes, 242nd Me meeting, Conelus ion 3):A. Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor India (CP.-61 (34)) presentinghis reasons for suggesting that the assurance recommended by the government-p India      military support to Afghan-is tan against military aggression by soviet Russia, should not be given:that the British Minister should be instructed to agree to the Afghanrequest for the sale of munitionsif the Government of India agree andare able to supply them, and that heshould ascertain in a friendly talk with the Afghan Prime Minister whatthe latter had in mind in suggestingconsultation with the British GeneralStaff in connection with the defenceof the northern roar&apos;,It was clear from the discussion that the policyreaffirmed in 1928 was not in question, namely,that the independence, and integrity of Afghanistanis essential to the defence of India and theEmpire.
On the question of whether we ought to make anyfurther communication to the Afghan Government toprevent their drifting under Russian influence the Secretary of State for India recalled that wehad already given two assurances, namely, (i) inJuly, 1951, to the effect that we could not regardwith indifference unprovoked aggression againstAfghanistan, hut that the exact steps taken in theevent must depend on the circumstances of the moment;and (ii) in October, 1932, to the effect that anattack on Afghanistan would be regarded as an attackon British and Indian interests:   if diplomatic action failed we should, break off diplomatic and official commercial relations with the SovietGovernment, but any further action must depend onthe circumstances of the moment .   Any further communication would involve a definite promise ofmilitary support.   This would have the followingembarrassing and even dangerous results, viz *:-(1) Enquiries as to what kind of military support ^e could give   and as yetthere was no approved plan for thedefence of Northern Afghanistan:(2) Reactions on the Afghan Government.The promise might render them provo-cative and might tend to strengthen the enemies of the present regime:(3) Difficulties as to the form of the promise.   If it was a secret agreement it would be contrary to the Covenant.If it was public it would injure Zahir.If it was only a statement of the present policy of the existing Government andnot with binding force on future british governments it would probably do harmrather than good.These objections were so serious- that they couldonly be faced, if it was really necessary to preventthe Afghan Government from drifting under Russianinfluence.    In the view of the British Minister atKabul,, however, there was no such danger^, for he hadgivem evidence of the friendly attitude of Afghanistan tan.
towards Great Britain.   If the situation changed, itmight he necessary to give him further instructions,but for the time being there appeared to be no need to make such a communication, and the Afghan Govern-roent had not hinted at the need for any such declara-tion.   What they did want was (i) arms, (ii) adviceas to the defence of their northern road,   ^heSecretary of State advocated that the British minister should be instructed at once to take up these ques-tions with them and to report further for instructionsif, in the course of the talks, there emerged anyneed for a further declaration of policy.The Prime Minister pointed   out further objectionsto any secret agreement.   He recalled that questions were constantly being asked, in Parliament as towhether there existed any secret commitments.The Secretary of State for India admitted that theGovernment of India would prefer a declaration to bemade here and now.   this was the view of the GeneralStaff in India.    In the course of his correspondence with that Government he had asked, a number of qu.es-tions&apos;which as yet remained unanswered.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to paragraph 11 of the telegram from theBritish Minister at Kabul dated March 3rd (page 10of CP.-61 (34)) stating that the Afghan Governmentwere greatly impressed by constitutional developments in India as indicating an impending abdication ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government, as well as by Japan&apos;sfirmness of purpose and growing strength. Hesuggested that the Minister should be given authority to contradict these suggestions.-7-
The Secretary of State for India said that hehad formed the same opinion and. had full intentionof giving the necessary instructions.The President of the Board, of Education found himself in. general agreement with the conclusionsof the Secretary of State for India.   There were three possible policies in Afghanistan:- (1) Coercion,(2) Subsidy, (3) Common Interest.   The first twohad been tried, and. now we were working on the third.The Secretary of State for War expressed agreementwith the Secretary of State for India in the import-ance of an independent Afghanistan:    in the proposal that India should sell arms to Afghanistan at areasonable price:    and that we should intimate our willingness to advise on the defence of the northernroad.   There were two points, however, on which his military advisers thought that the Secretary ofState for India&apos;s advice might have adversereactions.   First, if we wished to keep Afghanistanout of the clutches of Russia it was essential toimprove the communications from Landi Ko-tal to Kabul.Moreover, the moment appeared favourable for taking up this question while we had a friendly Governmentto deal with.    A second point on which the GeneralStaff disagreed with the Secretary of State forIndia was his suggestion that if the Afghans asked us to help them it would be necessary to reopen thewhole question.   They agreed, that it would not bepossible for us to tell the Afghan Governmentexactly what we intended to do for their defence.The last thing was to divulge our plans.   TheGeneral Staff, however, had discussed with theGeneral Staff in India, and, he thought, the IndiaOffice, the kind of statement, which the british minister at Kabul might have authority to make if-8-
some statement should become--necessary in order to avert the danger of Afghanistan falling into thehands of Russia.   The general terms which theycontemplated were as follows I-&quot;We desire a strong independent Afghan-istan as ardently as you yourselves:to this extent our interests areidentical.   If, therefore, you shouldbe the victim of an unprovoked aggres-sion by Russia and should ask us tohelp you, we will do so by all themeans in our power.   The definiteform which our assistance will take,must depend, on the circumstances thatexist at the time, and must in any case be a matter of discussion between us.Put it is certain that we cannot cometo your assistance as quickly or as effectively as the eventuality will undoubtedly demand unless the oommu-nications between our countries areradically improved and certain other antece-dent measures taken before the crisisis upon us.   We have no intention ofannexing a square inoh of your soilor of remaining in your country a mount longer than is necessary&quot;.The Secretary of State for India thought therewas no difference in   principle between the Secretaryof State for War and himself.   In his view thequestion of road communications from Kabul to india was bound to arise in connection with the discuss ionson the road from Kabul over the TTindu Kush.   Rutat the same time he did not. wish to cress the mattertoo strongly at the outset.    As to the form of wordshe suggested, that the Departments concerned, mightdiscuss the matter and bring it up if the situation the Prime Minister pointed out that if too muchstress was laid on the Landi Kotal - Kabul road atthe outset it would give rise to suspicions.   Theright way to put the matter was that if they wantedus to help in the defence of the northern road.should render this course necessaryit was essential for us to be able to get to its omehow.
The Cabinet agreed -(a) To reaffirm the previous policy ofregarding the independence andintegrity of Afghanistan-tan as essentialto the defence of India and the Empire:(b) That the British Minister at Kabul,in answering the enquiries addressed tohim by the Afghan Government regarding(i)    the sale to them of arms at reasonable prices by the Governmentof India;    and(iij    advice as to the defence of theirnorthern roadshould he instructed to proceed on the linesof paragraph 14 or the Secretary of Statefor India&apos;s Memorandum and to report furtherfor instructions if,  in the course of the talks,  there emerged any need for a furtherdeclaration of policy:(c)    That the question of the improvement ofthe road from Landi Kotal to Kabul would naturally come up in connection with thediscussions on the defence of the roadover the Hindu Kush:(dj    That the Secretary of State for india should take up with the GovernmentDepartments concerned the form of thestatement to be made to the AfghanGovernment if,  contrary to presentindicationsj a further statement ofour intentions should become necessary:(e;    That the British Minister at Kabulshould be instructed to take appropriate action to remove the impression of theAfghan Government that developments inIndia indicate an impending abdicationof His Majesty&apos;s Government.

It had been thought necessary to bring matters to a head and at .a recent meeting it had been shown that the Dutch hadno scheme.      The proportion of native rubber was rapidly rising.      He intended to report the whole situation to the Secretary of State for the colonies on his return.The Prime Minister asked that the attitude of&apos;the United States of America should be kept in mind as otherwise they might become hostile.      It was also necessary to keep as friendly as possible withM. Colijn.The Cabinet took note of CP. 65 (34).

WATER SUPPLIESroposeciIgmergencyliii.(previous Reference:1 Cabinet 8I (14), Con-I elusion 17.)6.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Health (C.P.-13 (34)) advocatingthe Introduction, as a matter of special urgency,of an emergency Water Bill to deal with thesituation arising from the prolonged shortAge ofrain.   The Memorandum described the provisions ofthe proposed Bill and the powers the Ministers ought to t ahe .The Secretary of State&apos; for Scotland asked that the Bill might be made a United Kingdom bill as some parts of Scotland were also short of water.There was a strong desire on the part of the Cabinetto speed up the passage of the Bill notwithstanding the state of the Parliamentary programme.Some discussion took place as to whether theproposed powers should be taken permanently ortemporarily, for the present emergency.The Minister of Health.was contemplatingpermanent powers which could only be.put in operation on the decision of the Minister of Health inconsultation, if necessary, with other ministers concerned such as the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries.The Prime Minister pointed out that some ofthe powers to be taken in the Bill, and moreespecially those referring to compensation water,would prove v^ry controversial.      If the Bill wasto be passed, rapidly through all its stages hethought it essential that it should be a purelyemergency measure limited in time.A suggestion was made that there should be anemergency Bill to be followed by a Royal Commission
on the question of more permanent powers.The Minister of Health accepted the principleof a Bill of limited duration but wished to considerthe time for which it should provide.The Cabinet agreed:-(a) To approve the proposals of the Minister ofHealth in CP. 13 (34) for an emergencyV/ater Bill subject to the following:(b) That the Bill should be a United Kingdommeasure:(c) That the powers provided by the Bill should only continue for a limited period.(d) That the Minister of Health should complete the Bill as soon as possible and afterconsultation with the Secretary of Statefor Scotland and the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries, should send it to theCommittee of Home Affairs;.  . if necessary(e) That the Committee of Home Affairs should/hold an emergency meeting to deal with theBill in order to avoid delay.-14-
ME COTTONIrADF.Report of cabinet committee.(previous Reference:[Cabinet 6(34), Con-I elusion 11.)7.    The Cabinet had before them the Report of aCabinet Committee (C.P.-72 (34)) which had beenappointed on February 14th (Cabinet 5 (34), Con-clusion 6) to consider the questions raised in aMemorandum by the Minister of labour (CcPo-30 (34))relating to the regulation of wages in the manufacturing Section of the Cotton Industry,An Appendix to the Report contained an outline ofthe provisions of a Bill which, in the view of theMinister of Labour, would be appropriate if it were decided to legalise agreed rates of wages in thissection of the industry.   The recommendations madeby the Cabinet Committee were as follows:-(1) To accept, in principle, the proposal of the Minister of Labour that legis-lation should be introduced forthwith,as an experiment, to make agreed ratesof wages binding throughout . the rnanu-fact\jr*ing section of the cotton industryin the Lancashire area.   mhe legisla-tion to be strictly limited to thisparticular section of the industry andto be operative for a limited periodof, say, three years.(2) To approve, as a roiigh basis of theproposed legislation, the provisionsoutlined in&quot;the Appendix to thisReport.(3) &quot;&quot;o authorise the Minister of labour to arrange for. the preparation of adraft Bill on the lines approved bythe Cabinet, on the tmderstariding thatthe Minister of Labour will consult with the President of the Board ofTrade generally on the details ofthe Bill, and in particular in regardto certain outstanding matters,,e.g.,scope, sanctions, etc., which havebeen remitted to them for consldera-tion.(4) That the draft Bill should be circulatedto the Cabinet in order that the policyembodied in it may be considered and finally approved before the Bill is referred to the Home Affairs Committee.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attentionto the following extract from Paragraph 11 of theReport before the Cabinet::i7/e may, however, point out that bothsides agree that no responsibility should fall on the Government for the actualterms of the agreements reached by them......&quot;He attached great importance to this principle and hoped that it would be given prominence in any public discussions.The Minister of Labour agreed that this wasfundamental.    He emphasised the great importance ofthe utmost secrecy in this matter until the Bill wasproduced.The Cabinet agreed:-(a) To approve the recommendations of theCabinet Committee as set forth above.(b) That in any public announcements emphasis should be laid on the principle that no responsibility should fall on the Govern-ment for the actual terms of theagreements reached by the two sides.(c) That strict secrecy should be observedc

Unfortunatelyhowever the President did not arrive in time for thediscussion.The Cabinet began the discussion of the various questions set forth in CP. 70 (34).Question 1.    &quot;Is there any criticism of the suggestionthat our &quot;long-range&quot; Defenbe programme must take into account the permanentelements in the problem as well as theimmediate outlook?&quot;Doubts having been raised as to what was intended by the &quot;permanent elements in the problem&quot;the Secretary to the Cabinet, who had acted as chairman of the Committee,illustrated the Committee&apos;intention by reference to Paragraph 17 of the Reportwhere it was pointed out that:&apos;&apos;Por all three Defence Services there areCertain general requirements irrespective ofwhere they have to operate, e,g., for themaintenance of our sea communications, whichis the first principle of Imperial Defence,a main fleet to provide the shield benindwhidli our cruising forces are able to protectour merchant ships, as well as suitablydisposed and adequately defended bases:    for
our Army and Air Force, a nucleus of strength,sufficient to safeguard our responsibilities in any theatre of war until any necessaryexpansion can be carried out, as well assafe sea communications and ports of embarka-tion:    for all three Services, sufficient supplies, reserves and ancillary services ofall kinds.&quot;Subject to this explanation and on the   under-standing that there was no intention to incurexpenditure on measures of defence required to provideexclusively against attack by the United States,France or Italy, the Cabinet agreed -That our &quot;long-range&quot; defence programme must take into account the permanent elements in the problem as well as the immediateoutlook.lelations with   Question 2 (i)Japan.&quot;Does the Cabinet approve the general recommenda-tion that we should try to get back &quot;at least to our old terms of -cordiality and mutual&apos;respect with Japan?&quot;Question 2 (ii)&quot;What does it mean and how can it be done?e.g., next question.&quot;Question 2 (iii)&quot;Is this reconcilable with our commercial policy towards Japan?&quot;Question 2 (iv)&quot;What bearing has it on Anglo-American relations?&quot;In view of  Question (iii) above the Cabinet were reluctant to take up this question in the absence ofthe President of the Board of Trade, but after some discussion came to the conclusion that the subjectmight atU^ast be opened up in. its political aspects.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that he proposed to circulate acollection of Minutes prepared in the Far EasternDepartment of the Foreign Office.    They had norelation to the Report under consideration but consisted of a number of reports on various aspects of ourJapanese policy find their general result rather
strikingly confirmed the recommendation of theReport as to the desirability of good relationswith Japan.From these reports he gathered that if necessary be;    - ,we might/able to go so far even as denouncing thetrade treaty with Japan without upsetting the diplomatic situation unless we also worked up other nations against Japan.      The most serious difficultiesarose in connection with the forthcoming Naval Conference.v.s the Aia^ricaiiij were urging us to join with them in opposing the Japanese demand for parity.     We had comethrough the Manchurian difficulties with no greatdetriment to our relations with Japan but he didforesee great difficulties in connection with the Naval;(?Lt)lO.Conference.      He had been doing everything possibleto improve relations with the Japanese in detailthough there had been no opportunity for anythingspectacular in this direction.      As he had informed the House of Commons, States at Geneva had given eachother assurances that they would not recogniseManchukuo.      He had some suspicions that the UnitedStates were trying to obtain favours there and thatwas   a    situation that had to be watched.In reply to the Secretary of State for War hesaid there had been anticipations that Japan havingcompleted, her work in securing the nominal independence of Manchukuo under an Emperor would next start to put pressure on North China.        While the Chinese believedthis to be the aim of the Japanese they had alwaysmaintained that the absorption of China could not be accomplished .      China was too resistent.      There was something to be said for the view that if Japan was to expand such expansion was preferable on the continent of Asia rather than southward.
The Secretary of State for War pointed out thatan awkward situation would arise if Japan came south as far as the Yangtse.The Secretary of State for India pointed out thedifficulty that at present no nation had any influence.like germany with Japan who/was isolatea.        It would he a great advantage if we could recover our influence there.Even now vve probably had more than any other country.The difficulty he foresaw, however, was in reaching an accommodation on commercial lines.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed with theSecretary of State for India.        everyone must share the anxieties that had been expressed by the Secretary ofState for War on this possible new menace.      Thatanxiety would continue as long as Japan was isolatedbut that was an argument for the policy in the Reportwnich he warmly supported.        As to the difficultyof achieving good commercial relations, he believedthat the Japanese now realised that they were comingup against western standards of civilisation.      He didnot oelieve that there were any difficulties which frankdiscussion might not solve.    He recalled that theJapanese were a sensitive people and that thetermination of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance had been agreat blow to their amour X-^represent.      They had regarded the Alliance as a hallmark and its severance had beena great blow to them.        The very fact of our offering to have a fresh discussion and some kind of bilateralunderstanding would tend to restore their ruffledfeelings.        He referred to a letter he had seen from(Mr. Snow of the   Tokyo     Embassy recording certainapproaches from Ministers with an indication that theEmperor was behind them suggesting a strong desire forclose relations with this country.      Mr. Snow had-25-
considered that it was important to follow up theseapproaches. 271Turning to the Naval Conference, he gathered that the Americans, wanted us to line up with them in opposing any alteration in the Japanese proportion.He could think of nothing more likely to give offence to Japan than this, and he thought we should make clear to the Americans that we could not pull thechestnuts out of the fire for them.      While recognising that this question was affected hy all sorts of technical considerations he put as a basis  fordiscussion the opposite point of view:    we shoulddecline to align ourselves with 7/ashington;    indicatethat we were not prepared to submit ourselves to the limitations of a Treaty, and say that we did notmind what America chose to build.        This would freeus from the hampering restrictions of the treaty in matters of design and so forth and perhaps enable us to carry out more effectively our obligationsfor defence at home.      At the same time we might goto Japan and say that we had not linked ourselves with America.        If this were done Japan would hefree from the fear that we might be united with Americaagainst her.       Moreover, she ought to realise that if she was going to enter into a competition in armamentswith America she would reach breaking point financiallyand therefore that there must be some limit to herbuilding programme to which we could adjust ourselves.^osed Pact He therefore suggested that there should be a PactNon-Aggression.of Non-Aggression with Japan for a term of years.This might have to be subject to certain assurances,for example, as to Japan&apos;s attitude on China.      If wecould get a satisfactory bilateral Pact it might havea beneficial effect on our relations which would enable us to concentrate on the serious situation that was developing nearer home,-26-
The Lord. Chancellor strongly supported a policyof close friendship with Japan.    A hostile Japan    272meant a risk to our Possessions in the Par East,a menace to India and Australasia.    What we riskedby good relations with Japan was (l) trade,  (2) date-rioration of our relations with America.      As totrade, he thought the difficulties were not insur-mountable.    As to America, what were we going to lose?.     He doubted if the pursuit of friendly relations with Japan was inconsistent with good relations with the United States.The First Lord of the Admiralty strongly supported the Chancellor of the Exchequer.      Japan wantedequality in armaments, but she might not press this demand if she had a pact of mutual non-aggressionwith this country.    He had a good deal of information,however,  to show that in Japan the military partyoften v/worked quite independently of the diplomats,and this involved difficulties with which we wouldhave to reckon.      A non-aggression pact between japan and this country might actually please America,because it would show the Americans that we couldexert influence on Japan.The First Commissioner of Works presumed thatthere was no risk of our being drawn by a non-aggression pact into any troubles in the Far Eastbetween Japan and Russia.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat a non-aggression pact would be of advantage tous.      We never wished to attack Japan.      Our desirewas that they should not attack us.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries suggestedthat the pact would be treated in China as a signthat we should never interfere with Japan.The Prime Minister thought it would be regarded in America as an Alliance.The Secretary af State for Air asked what wouldbe the attitude of the Dominions?.-27-
&quot;lie Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs saidthat- Australia and New Zealand would welcome a non-aggression pact.   Canada would be pro-American inthe matter.   What wag troubling him was that if anything was to be done it must be accomplishedbefore 1935;   otherwise it would cause greatcomplications at the Conference.   Perhaps the non-aggression pact with Japan might be represented to america as a means to stop re-armament.  He referred tothe part played by Dominions m the former Japanese Alliance.The Prime Minister thought that all were agreedthat scmet.hin.ff would have to be done to improve relations with Japan and get on more confidentialterms,    it would, however,&apos; require very carefulconsideration.   There was first the question ofparity, which raised the whole question of navalpower in the Pacific    If Japan was not given some idea of our intentions before the Conference a veryserious.situation would arise.     The more quietlywe could improve our relations with Japan the better for the present....The Secretary of State for India thought that themost hopeful field was in naval matters.   He asked if the Admiralty could go into the possibility ofsome arrangement.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that itwas a wider question than one for the Admiralty.For example, the proportion of 10-10-7, which hadbeen mentioned in the discussion, would not reallvmeet Japanese views and was only a compromise betweenthe present position and what they desired.   Hethought this was a question for a small Committee.The Secretary of State for War asked whether itwould destroy the effect of a non-aggression pactwith Japan if we also had one with China.
Tjje Minister of Labour said the reaction onLancashire would be that they would insist onsomething being done at the same time with c ommerciaI r e1at 1ohs.mhe Prime Minister thought that the question hadbeen carried as far as it could be that day.The question had a trade side, which it had notbeen possible to dip cuss in detail, and a navalside.   The naval decision, however, was veryurgent and would prove fundamental.   He invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theFirst Lord of the Admiralty to prepare a proposal in the form of a definite recommendation for con-si deration by the Cabinet.   Owing to pressure onthe time of Ministers he thought it would benecessary for them to remit the matter in the firstInstance to their Officials.The Secretary of state for Foreign affairs undertook to do this, after consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and any other ministers concerned.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of state for. Foreign Affairs, in consultationwith the First Lord of the admiralty on the Naval side, and any -other ministers whom   he desired, and withthe assistance of the appropriateOfficials, should prepare for con-side-ration by the Cabinet a definiterecommendation for improving relationswith Japan.
