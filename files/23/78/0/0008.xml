supplementary estimates .precautionsby ministers in Charge.1. The Prime Minister asked that Ministers incharge of Supplementary Estimates should be careful,when not in the House of Commons themselves, to leave their Parliamentary Private Secretaries to watch the debate:    otherwise there was a risk of the Oppositionmoving to report progress while the Government Whipswere searching for the Minister in charge.
MEMEL. 2, The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsadvised, his colleagues to keep an eye on the tele-(previous reference: grams from Memel, which was a point where GermanCabinet 15(25), Con-        Nazi activity appeared to be breaking out at the elusion 5.)moment.    There seemed to be the possibility of aF Rds/ok)^       movement in Meroelland to seize this territory for germany.
imperial defence policy .Report ofDefenceRequirementsCommittee,(previous reference:Cabinet 62(33), Con-clusion 5(b) ,)3, The Cabinet had tinder preliminary considera-tion a Most Secret Report (C.P.-64 (34)) by theDefence Requirements Committee, which had beenappointed by the Cabinet Conclusion mentionedin the margin to prepare a programme for meetingour worst deficiencies In Imperial Defence,Consideration of this matter was confined tothe question of procedure,, and more particularlywhether it should be examined in the first instance by a Cabinet Committee or whether that stage shouldbe preceded by a general discussion at the Cabinet,Several members of the Cabinet gave warning that they would have important points to raise onthe Report,   Among those mentioned were:- thepolitical assumptions as regards the Far East andthe Continent of Europe:   the extent of the Locarnocommitment, on which the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs undertook to circulate a Memorandum,,if required:    the possibility of a commitment not mentioned in the Report, namely, at the DardanellesThe Cabinet were also reminded that the assump-tions on which the Report was based had been laidafterdown by the Cabinet/ponsideration of documents that had&quot;been before them at an earlier stage.In these circumstances the Cabinet agreed -(a) That the Cabinet Ministers who hadquestions on the Report which they wished to raise for examination should communicate them at once tothe Prime Minister:(b) That the Prime Minister should then consider how far these questionscovered the field of the Report andsettle what information should beprocured for the Cabinet:(c) That the Secretary to the cabinet should invite the Colonial Officeto examine the Report and informthe Prime Minister if there was anyparticular point which, in the absenceof the Secretary of State for theColonies, they thought out to beraised:
(d) That a Special Meeting of the cabinet should be held to consider the question,with the understanding that probably more than one Meeting would be required.
INDIA.Special Legis-lation againstTerrorism inBengalaExtension toParts of Assam,(previous reference:Cabinet 1(34), Con-clusion 3.)I tf IS It) 114. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for India (C.P.-51 (34))pointing out that the increase in the effectiveness of the measures taken in Bengal against the terroristshad had the result of driving some of them outsidethat Province into Assam.   The problem was a jointone, demanding full co-operation between theauthorities in both Provinces.    In order to renderthis co-operation effective the Government of Indiaconsidered it. necessary that certain of the special powers with which the authorities in Bengal werearmed under the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act,and other recent Acts, should be extended to Assam.The Government of Assam had accordingly drafted aBill which they desired to introduce in the AssamCouncil immediately. It was not proposed that theprovisions of the Bill should apply to the wholeProvince automatically, but that they should beextended by notification to those districts only where terrorism was active.   A summary of the main provisions of the Bill, the introduction of whichin the Assam Council the Secretary of State proposedto sanction, was attached to the Memorandum.In the course of the discussion on this question the Secretary of State for India said that if theAssam Legislature was unwilling to apply the death penalty agaj^tst tm^Lga^Arsm, in Assam to the extentproposed, he would report again to the Cabinet.It was necessary to take general powers for Assambut they would only be applied in districts adjacent to Bengal.    If the Assam Legislature was unwilling to grant permanent powers on the lines proposed,but were willing to grant them for five years, he proposed to report to the Cabinet.
The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Secretary of State for india as set forth in CP,-51 (34)).
99hi (-j5. The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumby the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland fC.P.-53 (34)) covering the draft betting and Lotteries Bill, dealing with betting on thecourse (including the legalisation, subject to restrictions, of totalisator betting on greyhoundtracks), lotteries (including competitions), andcertain amendments of the Racecourse Betting .Act,1938, affecting the operations of the racecourse betting Control Board.   The Memorandum pointed outthat, in pursuance of the Conclusion reached by theCabinet at the Meeting referred to in the margin,the Bill was a limited measure and did not cover the whole field dealt with in the Report of theRoyal Commission,   ^he Bill.was admittedly a compromise-mise, and the Memorandum indicated, briefly theimportant directions in which the Bill, on the onehand, relaxed the provisions of the existing law,and, on the other hand, imposed fresh restrictions.Authority was asked ^or the introduction of a Billon the lines of the draft.   Attached to the Memo-randum was an Appendix containing notes explaining the more important clauses of the Bill and callingspecial attention to the most important points ofprinciple on which specific directions of theCabinet were desired*The Bill was felt to expose the Government to agood deal of criticism from all sides of the betting and lotteries controversy, but as the subject hadalready been considered, by a Royal Commission andthe state of the law on the whole question was sochaotic as to make it difficult to administer, theCabinet considered it was necessary to introduce aBill in order to test Parliamentary and publicopinion.    It was recognised, however, that it might become necessary to make some modifications onCommittee Stage.
The Cabinet agreed  (a) approve the introduction of thedraft Betting and Lotteries Bill inthe House of &quot;Lords, on the understand-ing that after Second Reading in theHouse of Commons it would be sent toa Committee upstairs, and that,if circumstances rendered necessary, some sections of the Bill might be dropped:(b) adhere to their previous decision that the Bill should be a limited measure   as in the draft under con-sideration, and should not be extendedto cover the whole field dealt with inthe Report of the Royal Commission:(c) ^o approve the inclusion in Clause 3of a general prohibition of pari-imituelbetting (other than betting through alawful totalisator) although thatprohibition would extend to bothon-the-course and off-the-coursebett ing:(d) To approve the inclusion in Clause of a provision that the occupiers ofdog tracks should be required to allowbookmakers to carry on bookmaking ifa totalisator is in operation, butonly on the understanding that ifthis provision did not prove accept-able in Committee of the House ofCommons the decision as to whetherbookmakers were to be allowed tocar^y on bookmaking should be leftto the licensing authorities.In this connection the Home secretary was asked to give very carefulconsideration to the wording of clause 9 (S) of the Bill:(e) To approve the proposal that in Clause 14the power of revocation should be conferred on the licensing authority, in the firstinstance, with a right of&quot; appeal toQ/uart er Ses s ions :(f) mo approve Clause 18, which penalisesthe publication of matter (other thanadvertisements, drawings and. lists ofwinners, which are wholly prohibited)only if the matter is calculated to sotas an inducement to the public toparticipate in lotteries:    e.g., it-would not prohibit a newspaper from publishing as an item of news that aforeign Government had. decided topromote a lottery:(g) To approve the proposal that in Clause 9the sale of tickets in a bazaar lotteryshould be limited to persons attending the function:
(h) To approve the introduction inClauses 26, 2? and 28 of provisions to the following effect(i) To legalise the payment by theRacecourse Betting Control Boardof commissions to outsideagencies in connection withbets transmitted, to the Board&apos;stotalisators by such agencies:(ii)   ^0 amend certain provisions ofthe Racecourse Betting Act, 1928,for the purpose of removing doubt as to the legality of the Board&apos;present practice in conducting&quot;double event pools&quot; and &quot;pre-racepools&quot;:(iii) To provide that a totalisator onan approved horse race-courseshall be operated, only by theBoard itself or by the management of the race-course under a licencegranted by the Board:(i) To approve a provision in Clause SOthat the Court should, have power to order the confiscation of money and documents relating to an illegal lottery,and that the power should, be mandatoryon the 0 court:(j) mbat the Bill should, be printed and issued just before the Raster Recess.
TRE INCITEMENT1TO SEDITIONBILL.Applicationto police force *(previous reference:Cabinet 7(34), 6on-elusion 5.)6. The Cabinet had before them the followingMost Secret Memoranda by the Home Secretary on thesubject of the Incitement to Sedition Bill:-C.P.-53 (34)  , in which the cabinet were asked to authorise an extensionof the Pill so as to cover the Policeas well as the Defence Services.At the previous Meeting the proposed extension was criticised as beingrather considerable.CP.-63 (34), circulating for theinformation of his colleagues, inaccordance with their request atthe Meeting mentioned in the margin,details as to the nature of the additions to the existing law whichwould be involved in his proposal.In the course of the discussion the HomeSecretary explained that the object of the Bill wasto enable the authorities to deal with the instigatorsof incitement to sedition and not merely their tools,who could be dealt with under the existing law.If this gap was closed in the case of the defence services there would be an incentive to the instigat-ors of sedition to turn their attention to the Police,unless the latter were also covered.   There was noquestion of applying the Bill to the Civil Service.It was pointed out, however, that in applying themeasures proposed in the Bill to the Police theCabinet would be extending its provisions to a wide field, of conduct.   They would also be extendingconsiderably the field of search.   It might evenhappen that good citizens, with no evil intentions,might become open to very serious penalties.It was suggested that this extension would expose the Bill to a goodndeal of criticism and might eventend to jeopardize the pa-sage   of a measure whichwas much needed for the Defence Services.The Prime Minister made, an appeal to the Home &apos;Secretary not to press the matter at the momentunless he regarded it as absolutely essential.   .
The Verne. Secretary agreed to drop the applicationof the Pill to the Police Force, on the understandingthat, if events should render it necessary, he shouldhave the right, to reopen the question.^he Prime Minister thanked the Home Secretary,and said that if he did find it necessary to bringthe matter up it would be considered very sympathetic-ally .The Cabinet agreed  That the Home Secretary should have authority to proceed with theIncitement to Sedition Pill, but without the inclusion of the police force.(&quot;&quot;he Prime Minister left theMeeting at this point, andthe Lord President of theCouncil took the Chair.)

The Minister of Health recalled that at theMeeting referred to in the margin the decision as tothe time of publication of a Memorandum setting forth the Government&apos;s intentions in the matter of slum clearance and Housing had been postponed.   He had now started the first stage of the proceedings ofthe Bill, namely, discussions with selected repre-sentatives of local Authorities, and the next stage would involve formal discussions with the associations of local Authorities and the London County Council.He was advised that it would be very desirable for him to make a general statement of policy at theAnnual Meeting of the Associations of Local Authori-ties on March 15th, before he entered on the stage of formal discussions,   His idea was that on this occasion he would only give an outline of the scheme,without entering into the more controversial details.the he thought it would be useful if y Cabinet committee could assist him as to the form of his statement.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that hehad also started discussions, and a statement wouldbe useful to him also.The Cabinet agreed  To leave the question for decision to-  The Prime Minister,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,-^he Minister of Health,The Secretary of State*for Scotland.

The replyf-R. k        defining the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwas one of considerable importance, entailingdecisions on the following major points:-(l) Does His   Majesty&apos;s Government considerthat international regulations designedto reduce hours of work should be pro-ceeded. with forthwith?(2) If so, should they be on the basis of a4 0-hour week, or on the basis of someother number of hours?    and what shouldbe the nature and scope of these regula-t ions ?The Trade and Fmployment Committee had. suggested thatthe answer to the first question was in the negativeand,that the second, question did not therefore arise.On this basis the Minister of Labour had prepared adraft of a letter and a statement which he proposedto send, to the Director of the International LabourOffice,   These documents, for which he asked theapproval of the Cabinet, made clear that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment was opposed to the immediate formulation of international regulations concerning hours of work,but suggested, that the subject was one which could usefully be discussed only industry by industry., The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Minister.of Labour, subjectto the excision from the Statementattached to the draft letterof paragraph (IX), &amp;e,nd oo ourtn4rlemployment&quot;.
