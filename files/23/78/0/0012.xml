REDUCTION and limitation OF^RivlAMENTS.IMPERIALDEFENCEf, POLICY..---SECURITY ANDSANCTIONS.(previous reference:Cabinet 11 (34)Conclusion 4).?. R15(3^)3.1. In accordance with tne decision taken at theprevious Meeting, the Cabinet met to consider the -questions of Security and Sanctions, and for thispurpose had before them the following documents:-Consequences of a Breakdown of theDisarmament&quot; Conference.Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.     (CP. 68 (34)).Economic Pressure on Germany.Report of Committee of ImperialDefence Sub-Committee on trade questions in Time of War.

(CP.  82  (34)).Reply of the French Government to theBritish government&quot;s Memorandum ofJanuary&quot;29&quot;, 1934&quot;, TCrnd.  44-93).Despatch dated March 19, 1934, fromthe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to Lord Tyrrell (Paris) onhis conversation with the french ambassador,  covering a copy andtranslation of the French Note,(CP.  64  (34)).^he Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsaccompaniedopened with a statement setting out in full, and/bycitation of a number of passages both from thelatest French Note and. -from the report of his ownconversation with the French Ambassador, the problem at the en^which the Cabinet had to consider./of this staternenhe summarised the results of the recent negotiationsoil Disarmament to the following effect:-   germany is unwilling to remain disarmed below a certain minimum., and is not likely to be moved therefrom:France cannot agree to the German minimum unless shereceives some satisfaction on security:    consequent!if we still contemplate an agreement we must
Suggested consider whether we can find some way to meet theGuarantee.difficulty by means of a guarantee.   He was not^ thinking of a world guarantee extending    for examDieto the Par Past or South America, as that involved,great difficulties.   We ought to consider, however,whether we could arrive at some practical arrangement for a guarantee by the principal European States:that is to say, if a breach of the disarmament convention was made by any of them, the othersshould contemplate the exercise of certain restraints.Some such limited guarantee might have an advantage in meeting the difficulties of Dominion assent.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs warned, the Cabinet that the Dominions would give noassent to any arrangement involving a guarantee ontheir part.       ^ q*The Docroisary of State for Wew? -ad-&amp;e&amp; that theguarantee might include an arrangement under whichthe Great Powers should agree not to bomb one another.A comment *pao made--on-tfeisA-hat apparently theywere to be allowed to attack one another with artillerybut not with bombs IAn Alternative In the course of the discussion apprehensions wereSuggestion,expressed at the idea of entering into any new-commitments, economic or otherwise.    The reality ofthe situation was that Germany was re-arming and intended to re-arm whatever happened.   mhe real question was as to whether, for ten years, she was going to limit herself to Herr Hitler&apos;s proposals,which were not so very unreasonable, or whether there was to be the prospect of unlimited and muchgreater re-armament by Germany.    It was to prevent this latter prospect that the country was to beasked to pay the price of a guarantee.-2- s -
It was suggested in this connection that france would not be satisfied with any economic sanctions.As the Reports before the Cabinet showed, they wouldnot work unless America was a party to them __ a vervdubious assumption.    The/ would, not be effective without blockade,  involving hostilities .   France would only be satisfied if Great Britain was prepared togive a guarantee that would involve armed intervention in a war.   Given the conditions in France today, toally ourselves to France was a terrible responsibility.Our own interest in Europe was, first, the defence ofLondon against air attack, which many people wouldprobably prefer to provide by our own forces:    and,second, Belgium,   The French inclination would beto say that we need, not trouble about air defence as they had ample air forces:    in fact, the interestof France would be a larger British Army.   In any event some expenditure would have to be incurred inthis country on armaments, but in this latter formthe expenditure was less favourable to us than anyother.   An alternative suggestion was made, therefore,that we should re-examine Herr Hitler*s proposals and decide how fa.r we were prepared, to go towardsaccepting them.   That must be done in any event, since otherwise people would say the Government did not know their own mind, and France would raise thequestion&apos;of breaches of the Treaty of Versailles\whereas if we stated that we considered a certain measure of re-armament by Germany reasonable, weould not be called on for sanctions.   Moreover, this appeared, the only method to obtain a limitation ofGerman       armament.   Agreement with France, it wassuggested, was only possible on conditions of ac
guarantee which the nation would not accept.Consequently it was suggested that, in conjunctionwith Italy, we might agree substantially to HerrFitlerTs proposals, with such reductions as we could obtain, leaving it open to other countries to sign.At the present moment Herr Hitler would, probably beready to make a concession in order to legalise ameasure of re-armament.    In a few months that would   -no longer be the case,    A second, alternative proposal was to obtain a common declaration of programmes by Germany and other Powers spread overten years ,proposal wasmhe first alternative  /   found open to a numberof objections.   The French would become very embitteredand would accuse us of perfidy. We and the french were joint signatories of the Treaty of Versailles.It might be a reasonable thing to modify the Disarma-ment Clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, but thisasould not be done without the consent of our co-signatories .   For us to suggest unilaterally thatwe were going to release Germany from her obligationswould justify such accusations.   An embittered France,with her great strength in the air and in submarines,and immediatewould be a formidable/ risk to this country.    she would take measures which would, provoke countermeasures in Germany and would compel us also tore-arm.   The general rise in temperature might eventually result in war.   While it was generally recognised that France, by her provocative policy since the War, had done much to bring about thepresent situation, the Cabinet were reminded thatthe original fault lay at the doors of the UnitedStates, owing to their failure to ratify theAgreement of June 28,&apos; 1919, for assistance   to France
p334in the event of unprovoked aggression by Germany,    It-was felt also that Prance had a good deal 0* justificationin her present attitude towards the German proposals.It was suggested that if there were no Disarmament Agree-ment it was essential, from a political, strategical and&apos;probably economic point of view, that we should have close[feet on relations with France,   The Cabinet were reminded that\e, European[stem. since the War a diplomatic system had grown up in Europebased on Franco-British agreement and co-operation.Suddenly to change the whole plan would involve not onlyFrance, Germany and ourselves   but would upset everyfeet on nation in Europe,   Moreover, there was not the smallestmnany.reason to believe that Rerr Hitler would agree to standby his disarmament proposals if France was not a party tothe Convention,   ^here was a good deal of evidence to showthat the German Government meant to get back to thepossibility of using force, so that he might attain hisends, if possible, without fighting, but in the last resort by force.    Even while recognising and admittingGermany&apos;s grievances, there was plenty of reason to feeldoubts as to whether all Herr- Hitlerfs professions weregenuine1;    whether the Nazi religious, educational and propaganda movement was as innocent as was claimed, orwhether it led only to one issue;   whether the brown-shirtmovement had. in fact no military background.    Even whilegiving Germany her due    it was impossible to escapedoubts on these points.The suggestion that Herr Hitler&apos;s proposals werereasonable was contested.    If he was really reasonablehe ought to have carried out the Five-Power P*s* reached at Geneva, which had been signed by the German ForeignMi n i. s t e r, ^pb^^t-S^1^--^^r&apos;&quot;s......t-^ro 0* office-,
*ect on theDominions .suggestion to explore the Idea ofa, Guarantee.The Cabinet were reminded of the attitude of theDominions at the time of the Locarno Treaty.   since that time most of the Dominions had taken a strongline against becoming involved -in any commitments.It was suggested that to adopt a policy designedspecifically to keep us out of all war in Europe orthe Par East was to adopt too narrow a view,    If wecould secure the pacification of Europe and. the removalof all risk of aggression, it would be the greatest possible boon to this country, bringing with it a revival of confidence, the unfreezing of channels of trades which were more important to us as a greatexporter than to anyone else.    Our policy, it wassuggested, ought to be directed towards the restorationof international peace and confidence.   We could not do this by backing out of Europe and leaving others to take the consequences..  We should recognise thatPrance was justified in refusing to disarm withoutsatisfactory assurances of security.   At any rate, weshould, recognise that Prance would not disarm withoutsecurity; and in the present state of French politicsno Government could thwart the instincts of the french people in this matter.    It was suggested, that, on abroad, view, more attention ouftht to be given to security,which was really the crux of the whole situation *The fact that the French had Introduced the idea of sanctions was evidence of a realistic mood on their part and ought to be welcomed as raising an essential part of the problem to be solved.    It was suggestedthat this problem might be referred to the ministerial committee on Disarmament, for examination in the lightof the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.    This proposal met withgeneral support.
[guarantees&quot;jnd Sanctions .mhirdvppe^t ionGermanv andthe Leagueof Nations .Some discussion of a preliminary nature took placeon the form of a possible guarantee.    Economic sanctionsit was generally admitted, were not likely to be safe oreffective, for reasons already mentioned.    On the otherhand, it-was suggested that this plan, which appearedto commend itself to the French Government, need notnecessarily be rejected for that reason.    If the accept-ance of economic guarantees would have the effect of...inducing France to agree to a Convention, they might be worth considering, unless it was found on examination in detail that their effect on this country and theDominions would be serious.    In this connection theCabinet were reminded that economic ^sanctions  wouldinvolve a cessation of debt payments by Germany, andrequired, the co-operation of the Dominions .   Apart fromeconomic gua.ran.tees, a good deal of reluctance was expressed as to the desirability of accepting anymilitarycommitment that would, have the appearance of a / alliance with France.The question of what nations should be asked toco-operate in sanctions was left to the Ministerial0 ommittee.Yet another suggestion was that we should continuethe discussions with France, making if clear that anyunlimited, liability on our part was out of the question.The question was raised as to why Germany refusedto come back to the League of Nations,    It was suggestedthat the reason was that the Covenant rendered any-alteration o^ boundaries extremely difficult.   A singlenation at the Assembly could block the way even to consideration of boundaries.   Consequently, if Germanyreturned to the League she would be estopped fromopening the question of her boundaries with Polandor Austria, and would be compelled to desist from herambitions in Danzig and Memel. Italy&apos;s attitude towardsthe League of Nations was based on somewhat similar considerations. -7-
^he Cabinet agreed  fa) To refer the question of Security,including Guarantees and Sanctions,to the Ministerial Committee on disarmament, fo^ consideration inthe light of the above discuss ion:(b) That for the purposes of this refer-ence the following Ministers shouldbe invited to attend the ministerial committee:-The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Agriculture andFisheries:(c) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should prepare,for the consideration of the ministerial Committee, a Memorandumcontai ring proposals for Securitydesigned to induce France to acceptthe minimum German, terms, but without involving a military alliance with france, and providing for an adequatequid pro quo to this country:(d) ^hat the Ministerial Committeeshould meet on Monday next, March26th,  at 11 a.m.*NPTB.    &quot;The time o^ thip Meeting was laterchanged to 5.0 p.m.
THE FRENCH 3, The Cabinet were informed that the FrenchKfOT F note would be published on the morrow in the Frenchpublicity Ar-angements , morning papers .    it would appear in the Englishpapers either tomorrow morning or later in the day.It was felt to be very important that the british press should be deterred, so far as possible,  fromrush-ing into a hostile attitude towards the Note.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should make appro-priate arrangements for seeingrepresentatives of the Press either the same day or on the following day, according to the date of publication in this country:(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should use his discretion in giving such parti-circulars of the situation as hethought desirable:    should, intimatethat the French Note is under active consideration by *the Government,but raises large problems requiringmature consideration:    and should do his best to induce them to adopt for thepresent as neutral an attitude as possible.If he thought desirable, he shouldhave authority to utter a non-committal warning as to thedifficulties involved in economic sanctions .Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,March 22, 19 34.
