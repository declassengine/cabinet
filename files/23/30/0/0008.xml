(1) With reference to Cabinet 29 ( 28),. Conclusion 1,the Cabinet approved the announcement in the House ofCommons, the same day of the names of Sir Philip LloydGrease and Lieutenant-Consnan&amp;er Hilton Young as the BritishExpert Representatives on the International commission which is to meet at the Hague on June 15th, In accordancewith the recommendations of the Genoa Conference,
Ifipk&amp;H HRPA-        (2) With reference to Cabinet 89 (S3), Conclusions 2-4,the Cabinet agreed with the Prime Minister and the Lord.Privy Seal that, in view of the latent developments inregard to reparations (via., according to Press reports,the acceptance by Germany of the proposals of the flepara-tions Commission), and in view of an intimation from SirDonald Maclean that he did not wish to discuss the question on the Motion for the Adjournment of the Bouse of Commons,&apos;it was unnecessary that the Prime Minister should speak on the subject of German reparations and our relationswith France on the following day.
THE IRISH SITUATION.

(3) With reference to Cabinet 27 (22). Conclusion 3. the Secretary of State for the colonies made a statement  on the Secretary of State for the colonies made a statement on the present Irish situation. He said that up to ten days ago he was looking forward to a free Election when the issue of the Treaty would be put to the people. It was common ground to all parties, including extremists, that such an election would have resulted in an overwhelming majority for the Treaty. At the last moment, however, an Agreement had been reached between De Valera and Collins which prescribed that the existing prepartions? of Treaty and anti-Treaty representatives should be returned by at the Election on June 16th, and it should be followed by a Coalition Government in which would be included four Republican Ministers. This pact had been come to by a Government which was avowedly for the Treaty: it was an arrangement full of disaster; it prevented an expression of opinion on the Treaty; it gave the Provisional Government no further representative of strength or authority from the Irish people: it left the Government in its present weak and helpless position; it ruptured Article XVII of the Treaty. The British Government had not insisted, in the interim Parliament, on exacting an oath from the members, but had laid down that there must be a declaration by Ministers. It was believed to be their intention to make De Valera on of the four Ministers, and if he and the three others became Ministers of the Government the Treaty would be definitely violated. At that stage some strong measures might become necessary, such as the resumption of powers or occupation of southern areas.

The reasons given by Mr Griffith and Mr Collins for an action which caused great dismay to some of their own officers was force majeure. There could not have been, they said, a real Election. Small bands of armed men could


have seized and destroyed the ballot boxes, and in other ways prevented the free exercise of constitutional rights. A second and weightier reason which they gave was the state of disorder in the country, which would be aggravated by an Election.

When Mr Collins was asked asked why he did not afford protection to the R.I.C. and the Unionists, his answer was that he does in fact afford such protection and prevents many outrages.

Had the Elections proceeded, he said, the Republicans would have maddened England with a series of outrages.   Whereas there were fanatical Republicans who were pure is motive though violent In method, behind them had gathered all the desperate elements of the population, who pursued rapine for private gain. They  could not be he distinguished  from the others and over all of them was the glamour of the Republic. Hence the agreement to proceed with the Election, and the Provisional Government which resulted from it would be elected in acco? ance with the statutory forms which we had required. But it was equally the Third Republican Dail, and that was its only Sand? in the eyes of the Irish.

It was at this stage that the draft Irish Constitution was received which the Provisional Government had agreed should ? be published not later than June 6th, so as to give the electorate ten clear days in which to consider it. This was the pledge given to Ard?hels and De Valera. The British Signatories had examined the draft, and it had caused serious disappointment. Each Signatory saw it separately and reached the same conclusion, that it was a negation of the Treaty, though they were assured by Mr Griffith and Mr Collins that it was not intended to be so. Yesterday they gave the Irish representatives their observations upon it. The Irish leaders said they would make the Constitution conform to the Treaty.
$here waa nothing to complain of in their attitude in this regard,   $he practical atep new being taken was a die one a action of  the draft by the Lord Chief Justice and the Irish LegalAdviaer, Mr Thigh Kennedy, K,0,   They were meeting today tosee if they could together frame a Constitution which wouldgive fall effect to the treaty, but the diatance between their Constitution and the Treaty waa almost as great aaWhen the Prime Minister began his negotiations with Mr BeValera*TBR LOW PRIVY smz- said that M* Oolline had described the reply aa &quot;a pretty poor document&quot;.THE BVGVLV^Am OF STATR FOR TRT COLONIES, continuing, saidthat the Election would take place in the middle of Juno,It would not be right to say that it would be worthless,-for some Labour and Independent candidates might be elected,and Mr Collins had received assurances that after the.Flection semeof De Valera* s supporters would cross over,because they were convinced that england waj3 loyally carryingout her pledges.   The idea was to try and get a non-PartyGovernment, so as to secure trantjuility in Ireland, and ata later stage a proper Flection on the main issue.   the june Flection would not be one in which the Irish people could he regarded as arming the Parliament to carry out theTreaty,   If the four Republican Ministers did not take the oath, it was possible there might be a resort to some snbter-fuge which would conform to the&apos;letter of the Treaty and yetnot involve the Republicans -in a serious departure fromtheir principles.The Constitution had to be passed through this JuneParliament.   If an agreement was reached on the Constitutionit would be odious to the Republic and members of the J)ail,and an endless discussion would follow.   Had there been a
Parliament with a big pro-Treaty majority% the Constitutioncould probably have been quickly pushed through*   If they agreed on a Constitution it would be published?   if theydid not agree, then he supposed the Irish would stillpublish theirs am we should have to denounce it. He hardlyknew what would then happen.   During these inconclusive dis-eusoions we might find either (l) the deterioration of thecountry continuing:   if so, it would slide into completeanarchy, with more murders of Protestants, more eonficca-tion of property, and a larger stream of refugees:   or(s? if they isolated brigandage, there might be a socialgain which might enable us to pass to a quieter periodwithout tragic occurrences *
IllMr Churchill then turned to the position in Ulster.The two Governments were further apart from each otherthan ever, m d each hlamed the other.   Sir J&amp;bos Oraigblamed the supporters of Be Valera who had succeeded inupsetting the agreement, between Craig and Collins on the.31st March,, and Collins admitted this.   Since the breachthe boycott and other measures of the I.R.A, had become more effective.   Whether it was a ease of sis Jp&quot;*one and half a- dozen^m the other, he did not know.   He would besorry to try and arrive at any other ratio.   The borderwas in a dangerous si situation, and matters were worse in belfast than they had been.   We had 19 Battalions inSstibtafe Ulster,, and yesterday some artillery was sent over.In addition there were 48,000 WAW *B&quot; and *0n Specials, and orders had been given to accede to Sir James 0raig*s request for arms and munitions to equip these..Mr Churchill here continued as follows:-&apos;f &quot;I am bound to say that X think we could do no less,having regard to the gathering of the forces from theSouth and the ferocious steps used against Ulster.   Thecontinuance of disorder of a serious kind in Bister may-be looked for and at any moment patience nay fee rupturedand we shall find ourselves in an atmosphere where people*see red&apos;.   Ministers should read the Irish papers, such asthe &quot;Freeman&quot;.   These papers, published - in Dublin   andthey are pro-Treaty papers - describe only the murders ofCatholics and attribute these horrors to Sir James Craig*aGovernment and the Orangemen,   Every outrage on one sideis replied to by an outrage on the other In a crescendoof conflict, whieh may bring about an explosion which mayput an end to our watching the laboured processes (connectedwith the Constitution) * *  .Thes?e were thus, said Mr Churchill, three main factors:-(1) The Constitution adjusted to our view might proveinsuperable to them when they return to ireland-7-
(2)   Disorder in the Bmitlij(5)   The situation in Ulster *The Prim Minister interjected that If they made their Constitution conform to our view Do Valera wouldnot be able to accept it and the pact would be broken.On the other hand if the Constitution were not made to conform to the Treaty then we should be confronted with a larger issue of the Republic versus the Empire *!fr* Church! 11 ^ in reply to questionsf said therehad been endless conflict in regard to the Collins-Craig agreement of  &quot;arch 31st*     Both had resisted eachother on small points *    Sir James Craig had made agroat effort to help, but after -the Be Valera-Oollinspact he had gone over to this other side.     Sir JamesCr&amp;ig had been willing to go great lengths and while he could not stand for unity lie would resign ratherthan stand, in its way.     Had Collins taken strong stepsand turned gtaie Irregulars out of their Buhlin strong-holds the whole situation in Belfast would haveimproved, but having joined hands with avowed Republicanswe could la rdly wonder- that the forth had gone backto its extreme and violent position.     &quot;I think wehave to give thorn assurances of help..&quot;The Chancellor of the Fscliequer asked whether the conversations between the Prime Minister and theLord Privy Seal with Mr, Griffith and Kr. Collinsthat morning threw any light on the situation.
THE PRIME MINISTER: "Mr. Chamberlain and I had an interview lasting 1\\1//2 hours with Mr. Griffith and Mr. Collins. It bore out Mr. Churchill&apos;s account of the situation. They are mere anxious about the North-East than about anything also. They talked of the extermination of the Catholics. I retorted that that was a great exaggeration, 80 Catholics have been killed, end 1?8 wounded since December 6th, 1921. They are considerable figures, but they do not justify Mr. Collins descriptions. It just happens that 72 Protestants have bean killed and considerable numbers wounded. We could get Mr. Collins to talk of nothing else, and when we were at last able to point out that there had been 37 murders in the South, he replied that this was due to the excited state of feeling provoked by Belfast, and that unless something were done the whole of Ireland would get out of hand. I quoted to him Lord Randolph Churchill&apos;s remark to Mr. Gladstone, &apos;You call yourselves a Government, whom do you govern?&apos; and added &apos;You have handed over the Government of Ireland to an Englishman, to Erskine Childers&apos;. Their general answer was &apos;You must let us govern in our own way. The solution will depend on the maintenance of good feeling. We will get Ireland right.&apos; They want on to argue that we were paying for the police in Ulster, and, therefore, we had the responsibility there. They alleged that the murders were committed by "specials" in our pay. They urged that we had handed law and order over to Sir James Craig, and the responsibility, therefore rested with us.

 
us *     They recalled eases of investigation in Ireland by great Britain, ana suggested an impartial enquiry.     they asked, why did we not let British troops take charge antproclaim martial law,     There would he great confidence inBritish officers.     This was a most extraordinary suggestion,but It lea one to which Mr, Griffith, came hack repeatedly. *MB. CHURCHILL pointed out that the northern a over n-ment were against martial law*THE PRIME M1BISTER said the 48,000 &quot;speeials&quot; were infast an army,THE SEQH3TARY OP STATS FOB WAS pointed out that theywere not lunler military discipline,THE CHAHCELLOB OP THE said he had opposed the increase of the &quot;specials&quot; on the ground of their greatcost, but sir James Oraig had maintained that they were moreuseful than the ordinary. a my.THE PRIMS Mill IS TEE said Mr, Griffith had pointed outthat ordinary policeman were trained men whereas the &quot;specials&quot;were not,ME. CHMBSBLAXSt &quot;&quot;Mr, Griffth said &quot;you might as well goand aim the East End,&quot;&quot;THE PRIME MIII8TSB; &quot;The fascistl In Italy would bea more exact analogy.     The situation did seem to point tothe need for impartial investigation into, the facts,&quot;ME- CHURCHILL said that Sir James Oraig had repeatedlyrecognised our right to investigate as much as we liked.THE PRIME MINISTER said we certainly had the right aswe were maintaining an army of about 57,000.MB, CHURCHILL said that Mr, Collins had asserted thatthe murderers in the Uorth were known, and Sir James Craig had asked for the nataes, but none had been forthcoming,
Waa Prime Minister said the most significant feature ofthe interview was that two or three times Mr, Collins had indicated that he was willing &quot;to give Ireland hack&quot; to as&quot;as a present,&quot;The lord Privy Seal said that the Initiative for the interview had come from the Irish leaders, and it wasohvious that they were eager for it.     They had raised thequestion of Ulster at once, and the tone of the interviewthroughout ha$ been of great gravity and of a menacingcharacter - not that the language used was menacing, butthat the nature of the discussion was so serious as to toomenacing,   They alleged that the murders in Belfast werepart of a deliberate warfare on Catholics, and they hadremarked to the Prime Minister that he (the Prime Minister)and De Valera should share the government of Ireland betweenthem, as much as to say that &quot;ono was as impossible as theother.&quot;     The Lord Privy Seal, continuing, said he had put the following question to Mr. Collins:   &quot;Supposing we were togive you this Investigation, would you he prepared to disavowthe I.E,A, in the Sis Counties, to tell them and all personsaffiliated to them there that they were bound to obey thenorthern Government pending the results of the Boundary Com-mission?&quot;   His reply was that he was prepared to carry out theagreement of March 31st hut that he was not prepared to holdup the hands of the Ulster Government while Catholics werebeing murdered.   Mr. Collins had then handed him a dossier wit]particulars of the murders in Ulster.THE SEC PS TAP Y OP STATE PGR WAR suggested that Mr. Collins&apos;answer indicated that he was behind the 2g- Divisions of theI,E,A. who were   causing so much trouble in the North.The Lord Privy Seal said he did not think his replyamounted to a confession that he encouraged the I.R.A.but It did mean that he would not openly discourage them.
THE PRIME MINISTER: "He says, "I can&apos;t leave these people unprotected with 48,000 Specials out against them"."

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE C0LONIES said the I.R.A. were endeavouring to upset the Ulster Government.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL: "They are in rebellion against a Government which is a part of the Treaty."

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES Said that in the Agreement of March 31st Collins had given up nothing, whereas Craig had undertaken to revise 170 sentences, to set up dual police, and a Catholic Investigation Committee. 

(Copies of the Agreement were handed to the Cabinet.)

All kinds of difficulties had been put in the way of the execution of the Agreement.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said the only case he and the Prime Minister had not been able to argue in detail was why the Agreement had not been kept.  They had laid the main stress during the discussion on the fact that the I.R.A. was in rebellion against the Ulster Government.

THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS pointed out that the only way for the Ulster Government to maintain its frontier would be to cross it. What would be the situation when that happened?

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES described in some detail the military situation which would them arise. 

THE MINISTER OF HEALTH pointed out it there was to be civil war this county would join in.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR, in reply to a question, said it would not be easy for our troops both to hold the border indicated by Mr Churchill and to police Belfast.

THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION thought an Enquiry into the outrages in Belfast, partly administrative and partly judicial in character, would be valuable.


THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOB&apos;THE OOLOGIES pointed out thatthe temper in this country was high and rising, and theGovernment would be told that they had been cheated by theSouth, and that - when loyal Ulst ermen defended themselveswe proposed an Enquiry.   The public would ash, &quot;$hat about an Enquiry into the South? where there was no. provocation,whereas the Catholics in the ISorth were a part of a movementto shatter the Morthern Government.   Sir James Craig hadfour men under sentence of flogging;   in the South not one .person bad been brought to justice.k  THE LORD PRESIDENT OF rriHE GCUKCI1. thought it would not do to have cn Enquiry in the Worth without one alec in the South.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that one was a dominion and the other was not.   In the North we had accepted finane-ial responsibility for law and order.   The burden of main-taining the Police was almost exclusively cars, and wo thushad a special responsibility.   He was profoundly concernedwith the public presentation of the trouble when it came.He was , not sure that Collins was not manoeuvring us into aposition whore our case was weak.   He had challenged us onUlster*   The first murders were the murders of Catholics, -in the main, the murder of members of the minority.   Mo-one had been punished, we had made no enquiry, we had armed48,000 Protestants.   It would be a bad case.   Our appeal would be to an Empire which was Protestant and CatholicThere had been 80 Catholics and 49 Protestants murderedand nobody had been punished or arrested.   It was our busi-ness to maintain a stern impartiality between all races andcreeds.   We were not a Protestant,or a Catholic, or even,as some tried to make us believe, a Mohammedan Empire.We were bound to be sternly impartial.   It was very Import-ant to carry the Dominions with us, to carry America and tocarry the outside world.    We should not have a breach where
a great case could be made against us. If we broke on the issue of "Republic versus Monarchy" we could count on solid support; but if we broke on Ulster we should get into the same atmosphere of doubtful responsibility as  in the case of Reprisals. He warned the Cabinet solemnly that there would be a shout of approval tomorrow if immediate action ware taken, but that the shouters themselves would give the most trouble three months hence; their tenacity would ? out, and they would turn to criticise the Government&apos;s methods and charge them with being too gentle here or blundering there. The religious communities would be against them. Democratic  communities were sentimental communities, and that was why a policy of repression could not be carried through. He strongly urged that they should take such steps as would eliminate the Ulster issue end leave a clean issue of "Republic versus British Empire". Whoever took the job on, however much the shouting might be for the first few weeks, would find the shouters turn against them. He was in favour of a judicial Enquiry. He did not see why Sir James Craig should object. They had to find the money, and Sir James Craig came to them with a demand for £5,000,000 - a very considerable sum. During the Enquiry neither Side would care to create evidence against itself, and they might thus be able for a time to stop the outrages and give time for the other issue to develop.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR asked the Prime Minister if he would be in favour of asking collins to allow them to put troops on both sides of the border?

THE PRIME Minister replied that they might certainly do so.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES said that Sir James Craig ought to be seen, and that he proposed to ask him to come to England that evening.


THE PRTMR &amp;XHISTER thought the invitation should be accompanied by an assurance that the Government would support his efforts to maintain order.TUB LORD CHANCELLOR suggested that a Scottish Judge&apos;might be selected ,TKE HUMS JOTXSTER said there Should be a Catholic ant\aProtestant Judge.TEE SECRETARY CD STATE FOR THE GOLOHIKS stated that sir james Craig might argue that this was putting a stigma onthe Northern Government and upon their own Judges *   Itwould be a difficult case to defend in the house of Coramono,and pressure would be put for a similar Enquiry In the South.TEE PRIME MINISTER said that in the South there was no -dispute about the responsibility;   it was the X,R,A.   Therewas nothing to Investigate.   In such an inquiry as he pro-posed we should be following a precedent laid down by lord balfour and Lord Wiorley, who bad instituted Enquiries whichhad given complete satisfaction on the ground of impartiality.THE,LORD PBESID^KT OP WE 00OHCIL said they should be careful not to put Ulster in the dock and call the South asa witness,   The state of things in the South was bad, andrefugees were spreading all over the country,   tie was against an inquiry in the North, but the scenic effect should be so arranged as not to put Ulster alone in the wrong,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL pointed out that, on the other hand,the strength of the ease for an Enquiry was that the special constables were definitely charged with murder and thatthey were in our pay.
THE PRIME MINISTER said  he would have as enquiry into the disturbances in the North.

MR CHURCHILL said that it was alleged by the Northern Government that Catholics friendly, to that Government were murdered by other Catholics. The whole of Ulster had been knit together by the pact between De Valera and Collins. The arrival of Judicial Enquiry would be out of relation to what would be going on all around and he did not think any effective conclusions would he reached. Another suggestion would be to take a particular area of Belfast and place it under strict Martial Law under a British Governor.

THE PRIME MINISTER: "And the Border too?"

MR CHURCHILL: "You have not enough troops for that. The Border trouble starts in Belfast. You could take a square mile of Belfast I think the Catholics would be relieved ant Sir James Craig might be induced to agree to this; or, in lbs second place it might be possible to go back to the Agreement of the 31st March which, has not been torn up."

(At this point there was a discussion on the military dispositions contemplated in certain emergencies.)

LORD BALFOUR thought that both the Belfast area and the Border ought to be dealt with.

LORD BIRKENHEAD pointed out that to deal with the latter might involve a rupture with the Southern Government.

MR FISHER suggested that the Ulster Battalions ought at to be stronger and said that he was all for proclaiming Martial Law in Belfast.

After some further discussion as to the difficulties which had been experienced in carrying cut the previsions of the Agreement of March 31st, the Cabinet agreed; -

(i) That Sir James Craig should be invited by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to cross to London that night:


That the Prime Minister should put toSir James Craig the proposal for a judicial enquiry into the disturbances in Ulster.17
pkvvnm&amp;m IS TIUS       (4)     THE HXBX&amp;I2ER OF LABOUR called attention to themsSE OH THE(iRISH SITUATION,       debate on Ireland which was to take place before the adjournment on the following day and the apprehensionfelt on the question of four republican Ministersforming part of a Coalition Government recognised byus,EE. CHURCHILL said that in his statement he proposed to say quite definitely that we would not tolerate the presence of Ministers who did not makethe Declaration required by the Treaty,   He proposedto confront the House with the worst side of theposition but he would not indicate the differences which had arisen on the quest ion of the Constitution.Those would appear within a few days if no agreement were come to.     He proposed to say that we were givingUlster support in ships and anas and that that earrledwith it the responsibility for seeing how they were, used.     He weuld explain to the House the defence putuj* on behalf of the- Be Valera * Collins pact and would.  show the vice of the Agreement,THIS mim mmsnm. said he thought every effort should be made not to create the impression that the trouble was in Ulster,     We could not carry on a warwith a divided country,   Ho question of legislation by us x?ould arise on the Constitution until it hadbeen adopted in Ireland,
(5)     With reference to Cabinet 89 (38), Conclusion 5the Cabinet had under consideration a Draft despatch to Lord Hardinga (Paper O.P. 3993) circulated by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affaire, -and a *Iotethereon by the Secretary of State for Wai* (paper c*P* - 4000).

Howorth, Acting Secretary to the Committee.Mr. T. St. Quintin Hill, Principal.Sale of Tea Bill.1. With reference to H.A.C: 99, Conclusion 3, the Committeehad before them a Memorandum (CP. 3911) by the President ofthe Board of Trade, covering a draft Bill relating to the sale of tea.It was explained to the Committee that this Bill had beenprepared to implement a pledge by the Government that legislation would be introduced to make permanent the provisions of the Saleof Food Order (made under the Ministry of Food Continuance Act)relating to the sale of tea by net weight. The Bill accordinglyprovided for the retail sale of tea by net weight in ounces orpounds, or in multiples of ounces or pounds. This requirementwould be a protection to the consumer, was supported by repre-sentatives of the Co-operative movement and of labour, and was likely to raise little, if any, opposition in Parliament.[8375]
The Solicitor-General referred to ancient legislation regardingthe sale of tea, and expressed the opinion that so far as possible itwas desirable in any new Bill to codify existing legislation. he proposed to communicate to the draftsman a note on the subject.The Committee agreed  (1.) To take note of the opinion expressed by the Solicitor-General that when Bills were being drafted theopportunity should be taken to codify existing legislation.(2.) To approve, subject to the consent of the GovernmentWhips, the introduction into Parliament of the Sale ofTea Bill.Supply of Bread 2. With reference to H.A.G. 99, Conclusion 3, the Committeeand Flour Bill. had before them two Memoranda by the President of the Board ofTrade (CP. 3911 and CP. 3957), the former covering a draft Saleof Bread Bill and the latter covering a draft Supply of Bread and flour Bill, which it was proposed to substitute for the draft Sale of bread Bill. The scope of the Supply of Bread and Flour Bill was limited to two objects : (1.) The bringing of the provisions of the existing Bread Actsas to weight into conformity with modern require-ments ; and(2.) The removal of the anomalous prohibition on the use ofself-raising flour.It was explained that the Bill would make permanent the pro-visions of the existing Sale of Food Order, in accordance with a pledge given by the Government. The effect of the Bill would beto bring English law into line with Scottish law, which since 1892had required that in Scottish burghs bread (with the exception of rolls and fancy bread) should be sold by weight and that the weight&apos; .    should be stamped on the loaf.Attention was drawn to representations made by Scottish LocalAuthorities, who desired that either fancjr bread weighing over12 oz. should be covered by the Bill or that a definition of &quot; fancybread&quot; should be given in the Bill. The Scottish Local authorities had also asked that a deputation should be received by the Presidentof the Board of Trade and the Secretary for Scotland.Attention was called by the Solicitor-General to certain provi-sions of &quot; The London Bread Act, 1822,&quot; and the Bread Act of 18:J.6which required to be co-ordinated with the provisions of the presentmeasure.As regards Clauses -1 and 5 of the Bill, it was explained thatthese provisions were inserted to legalise the use of self-raising flour,which, under existing legislation, was illegal, although non-injurious to health.The Committee agreed (1.)
