 EMS TO BE OffEKED       2. With reference to Cabinet 15(22) Conclusion  12,D OfflCEBS ABBfffiEE RAJKKB Of THE the Cabinet had before them the Keport of the&apos;CGHTING SERVICESJBBLUS TO ESTABLISH-   Committee to consider the Terms to be offered toSHT.Officers and other Banks of the fighting Servicessurplus to Establishment iCiP.3951).The Cabinet were informed that the Committeehad reached unanimous conclusions except as regardsthe point specified in paragraph 7 of the Keport.The Committee&apos;s recommendations would,  if adopted,preserve the relative position of Officers and menin the navy, Army and Indian Army respectively, andat the same time, would give compensation which,andin all the circumstances, was fair-;/reasonable andwhich,  in the aggregate did not impose an undueburden upon the Exchequer.      The Committee were satisfied that their proposals respecting apartIcular Service would not give rise to unsatis-- fled claims from the other Services.With regard to paragraph 7, the financialSecretary to the War Office informed the Cabinetthat there were a few men in the Infantry whom itwas proposed should be given the option to transfer to other regiments, and in the event of theirrefusing such transfer, the compensation payable in their case should be limited to one-half of thenormal compensation under the  scheme.      The cabinet were reminded that infantry soldiers enlisted for service in a definite regiment and that there isno-   power to transfer them against their will toanother unit9    Such power did exist byi statuteduring the war, but was no longer available.    TheWar office estimated that the cost of the proposal would not exceed  20,000, and urged that the plan was
was really an economical one,  in as much as thetoalternative would he  fes discharge the mens payingthem full eompensation0On the other hand,  it was urged that men whodeclined the offer of an opportunity of completingwiththeir period of service iax the colours, should notbe entitled to receive any compensation at all.The Cabinet were reminded that the men inquestion probably possessed legal rights to corn-pen sat ion,  the amount of which would have to bedetermined by the Courts,The Cabinet agreed:-(i) To approve the War Office proposal that men who declined to accepttransfer to another unit and elected to take their discharge,  shouldreceive one*-half the benefits givento men who were compulsorilydischarged;(ii) To approve the remaining recommendations contained in the Committee&apos;s Eeport(CP.3951);(iii) To authorise the Departments concerned to taiie steps to publish the approvedcompensation terms.
ADE BOARDS.iport of Lord&amp;ve &apos; s Committee,3. The Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Minister of Labour (CP.3956 ) relative to theReport of Lord Cave &apos;s Committee of Enquiry into theTrade Boards System.The special attention of the Cabinet was directed to the three following major defects of the presentsystem:-(a) A general want of elasticity and adaptabilityin the working of the Boards as a resultof which rates cannot be altered with sufficient speed to suit changing circum-stancee;(b) A tendency on the part of the Boards to  &quot;depart from their original function of protecting workers against sweating and tobecome wage regulating authorities; and(c) a tendency on the part of the Board to ignorespecial local circumstances and local needsthrough the failure to establish localmachinery.With regard to (b) above,  the proposal was that infuture Trade Boards should only have the right to fixminimum rates of wages by a bare majority of the membersof the Board.    Rates, other than minimum rates,  should,only be determined by the Trade Boards In future ifagreed to by not less than three-quarters of themembers on each side of the Board present and votingand would only be enforceable by civil process.The question was raised whether Lord Cave1s Committeehad really gone far enough and the suggestion was made that it might be desirable under present circumstances to restrict the Trade Boards System strictly to those industries where there was a danger of sweated labourand where there was practically no proper organisation for the workers,a j. soIt was/suggested that the Minister of Labour shouldae regards the dissolution orX tee A     jJ U V! 6 i &apos; Bsuspension of Trade Boards in industries where for one reason
reason or another, the existence of a Trade Board wasno longer required.    In this connection reference wasmade to the Dundee Jute Industry, which it was suggestedcould only be continued provided lower wages were paidthan the Local Trade Board was prepared to authorise.On the other hand, it was urged tteat the depression inthe Jute Industry was attributable to circumstancesother than the action of the Trade Board in question.The Cabinet agreed:-(ij To authorise the Minister of Labour toprepare a Bill for consideration by theHome Affairs Committee on the lines suggested by him in C,1.3956; due regard being had in the preparation ofthe Bill to the desirability of avoiding the extension of Trade Boards tounsuitable industries;f il) That -arrangements should be made to invite the Secretary of State for theColonies to attend the particularmeeting of the home Affairs Committeewhen the draft Trade Boards Bill wasunder consideration.

TH&apos; &apos; I3XSH (5)     $he Cabinet were Informed by the Lord PrivySI-Pu ATI 01.Seal that a meeting of Members of Parliament, mainlyRelief for southern of the Unionists&apos; party, had recently listened toUnionists8accounts of the distressed condition of certainrefugees from Southern Ireland, -and that a Deputationfrora the Meeting had urged that some steps should hataken to relieve genuine cases requiring immediate assistance.   After consulting with certain of hiscolleagues, including the Secretary of State forthe Colonies, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, andthe Chief Secretary, it had been decided that whileevery effort should he made to discourage any general&apos;exodus of Southern Unionists - from Ireland, special assistance might be necessary in certain individual cases. .   Accordingly, a small 0Qsamitt.ee, under thechairmanship of Sir Samuel )-loare, M.P.-, had been set upto.investigate such cases and the sum of  10,000 hadbeen put at the disposal of the Committee for reliefpurposes.   The Committee would be given expertassistance, so as to ensure that consideration .was limited to genuine cases,   It was most 6 desirable that t3&amp;eexistence or this special relief should not be- advertised.   The measures taken were understood to be satisfactory to the Reputation of the Members ofParliament.The Cabinet agreed;-To approve the action taken by theLord Privy Seal and his .colleagues!in arranging for the relief ofdistressed refugees from southern ireland.
AMALGAMATION OF SERVICES COMMON TO THE NAVY, ARMY AND AIR FORCE.

(6) With reference to Cabinet 11 (22), Conclusion 4, under which the Cabinet agreed "that a Technical Committee should be set up at once to make definite proposals for amalgamating as far as possible the common services of the Navy, Army and Air Force ....", the Cabinet were informed by the Chairman of the Committee and(the Minister of Health)that while it seemed probable that very great difficulties stood in the way of amalgamation of the common services, a good deal might be done in the way of co-ordinating such services provided that the Committee&apos; s terms of reference were extended so as to cover such co-ordination.

The Cabinet agreed:-

That the terms of reference should be revised so as to read as follows:-

"That a Technical  Committee should be set up at once to make definite proposals foe the amalgamation, or,if this appeared: impossible of un-desirable, for the co-ordination, so far as possible, of the common services of the Navy, Army and Air Force, such as Intelligence, Supply, Transport, Education, Medical Chaplains and any other over-lapping Departments, in order to reduce- the cost of the present triplication. The Committee should consider each branch separately and submit interim reports to the Cabinet as soon as possible."
