&quot;THE PRATH OP 1- &quot;The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that Mr ArthurMr ARTHURGRIFFITH.       Griffith, who had been one of the signatories of the IrishTreaty on behalf of the Provisional Government of Ireland,had died suddenly of heart failure.The Prime Minister said that the King was waiting tobe informed whether it was expedient that he should send a message of regret to the Provisional Government.The Cabinet were reminded of the firm and loyalattitude towards the Treaty displayed throughout by Mr.Griffith.   Mr Griffith would probably have been a Ministerof the Grown if the Constitution had been passed, and hehad, at the moment of his death, been connected with aGovernment which was fighting a loyal battle, so far as theCrown was concerned.   At the time of his death, however, hehad been merely President of the Dail.The Cabinet agreed  -(a) That the Prime Minister should advise theKing to send a message to Mr Arthur Griffith&apos;swidow, on personal lines:(b) That the Prime Minister and the signatories of the Treaty should send a message of regretto Mr Michael Collins .
WlAK REPA-        8. With reference to Cabinet 44 (22), the Cabinet had&apos;   *        before them a copy of the proposals presented to the Alliesby the Prime Minister at his meeting with M. Poincare&apos;&apos; andM. Theunis, on the previous day (Paper C.P.-4157).The Prime Minister began by giving his colleagues an appreciation of the present position.   He had spent sevenhours with M. Poincare and M. Theunls on the previous day,M, Polneare&apos; was n&amp; longer pressing his original proposalsfor a Customs barrier on the line of the Rhine;   nor theeven more objectionable proposal for a Customs Service onthe exits of the Ruhr;   nor for 60 per cent, of the shares in certain factories on the left bank of the Rhine, includingthe poison gas factories.   He was, however, still pressing for the seizure of forests and mines.   The more he (the PrimeMinister) and his colleagues in these negotiations examined&apos;these proposals, the more they disliked them.   The forestswere the property of the States, and to ask Germany to handover these was as though, if the circumstances were reversed,Germany were to ask the British Government to hand over theforests of Ontario or Quebec.   M. Poincare&apos; also wished, to seize the fiscal mines of the Ruhr, which belonged to the reich.   His latest proposal had been to form a Company towork these mines, with an Allied Board of three Directorsand a French President.   One obvious objection to this wasthat the workmen would not work under such conditions.Eventually he had made&apos;a proposal that the same princeple as had been set forth in the British proposals as regardsthe Customs should be applied in the case of the mines andforests also;   that is to say, the revenues from the mines and forests would be paid into a special fund at the reichsbank, which would normally be used, by the GermanGovernment but which could be taken over by the Reparation .Commission in the event of defaxilt by the German Government.
One diffx culty in such an arrangement, would &quot;be that the forest &quot;revenue is a State revenue.   This had been, pointedout, and it was then suggested t?o&amp;t where the States werenot prepared to pay their quota the Central Governmentshould pay an equivalent amount into the account.   Thelatest French idea with regard to supervision of the mineswas something less strict than control, but still involving an objectionable degree of interference.   At the end of thediscussion, when M. Poincare declared himself unable toaccept the British, proposals regarding forests and mines,and when he (the Prime Minister) had reiterated the deei-sions of the British Cabinet, it was decided to refer theproposals to a Committee of Experts.   The Committee was meeting at that moment, and the latest news indicated noapproach to an agreement,   In effect, M. poinear6* s policy was. tantamount to an attempt to break tho Treaty by thesubstitution of French proposals before the ReparationCommission had declared Germany in default.THE LORD PRUT SEAL said he would like the Cabinet togive some latitude to the negotiators,   He was not convincedthat an offer of abatement of debt could be made at thepresent moment which would not weaken&apos;the position theCabinet had taken up vis-a-vis America;   nor, on the otherhand, could an offer be made of an amount sufficientlysubstantial to evoke the gratitude of the Allies.   Any offer which we could make now would neither strike the publicimagination nor&apos; please the Allies ,   He would suggest thatthe negotiators ought to be empowered to go so far as to saythat during the period of any moratorium granted to Germanyno attempt should be made to collect any back interest dueor -any interest falling to be paid during the currency ofthe moratorium.
TEE PRIME MINISTER said that any offer made had to he-regarded not only in its bearing on Prance but also in itsbearing on the negotiations with the United States of America.It might be the case that we should not obtain a penny from France or Italy, but if we made it clear to the United Statesthat the action of America was responsible for the continu-once of chaos in Europe, it would be a negotiating pawnwhen our representative went to Washington.   That, he believ-ed, was the view which the Cabinet had taken.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL, in reply to a question, said thatwhen he said &quot;should not collect the interest&quot; he had meant that it should be written off.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said that the difficulty was to find a plan which would carry out the Balfour Motein its bearing on the United States and yet afford a suitableopening for a bargain with the Allies.THE PRIME MINISTER said he assumed that it was the wishof the Cabinet that the British negotiators should stand firm in refusing to hand over the management of the Germanmines and forests.In reply to the Secretary of State for India, THE PRIMEMINISTER, continuing, said he had no objection to a modifiedform of supervision so long as it did not involve actualdirection.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL emphasized the importance of anexact definition being.assigned to the term &quot;supervision&quot;.There was no objection to our exercising the right ofinvestigating and verifying facts, in the same way as theGermane had agreed should be done in regard to their Budget.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed, but added that he doubted whether that alone would satisfy the French, who were pre-pared to contemplate with equanimity a rupture betweenPrussia and Bavax&quot;ia.-/Is.;;.- -
At this point THE PRIME MINISTER referred to a letterreceived by the Secretary from Major Gaccia, of the IndianForestry Service, which showed clearly that what the french had in mind was the control and exploitation of Germanforests.After further discussion, the Gabinet agreed -(a) That the British negotiators should adhere to the position already taken in regard to german mines and forests i(b) That the British negotiators should be free to deal as they thought best with the quas-tion of bach interest and interest accruingup to the end of the period of any moratoriumwhich, might be granted to the Gezmans .At a later stage the Chancellor of the Exchequer enteredand informed the Gabinet of the position which, had beenreached Tip to that time at the Committee of Experts.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER stated that the Frenchwished to establish immediately the control of German mines and forests, and wished to.empower the Reparation Commissionto expropriate the mines and forests if and when they shoulddeem such.action necessary.   He had pointed out that if theFrench proceeded by such policy to destroy all confidence in Germany, no reparations would be obtained.   The Italians,who were disappointed over their failure to obtain deliveries of coal, had sided with, the French on the question of estab-lishing control of mines and forests, and the Belgians had gone further and had approved also of expropriation.   TheJapanese had shared the British view.   He (the Chancellorof the Exchequer) had pointed out that he saw no chance ofthe British representative remaining on the ReparationCommission if the policy now proposed were persisted in.There was clearly ho chance of a meeting of Principals that day.   It would be better to allow the Experts to concludetheir work, and that the Principals should meet on Monday.
The Cabinet took note of the statement ofthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, and agreedthat the Report of the Experts should beawaited before calling a farther meetingof the principal negotiators.
TUAJlM       3. With reference to Cabinet 41 (22), conclusion 2,policy the cabinet had before them the Interim Report of theTrade Policy Committee containing a number ef recom-mendatione on which agreement had been reached (C .P.41S9)(Appendix) .Tlig SECRETARY Off ST ASS FOE tttt, who had acted asVice-Chairman of the Committee, summarised these recom-mendations which dealt with (a) Land Drainage and Improve-ment, (b) Local Authorities * Schemes, (e) training centres for Immigrants, (d) the Extension of the Trade FacilitiesAct, (e) the Enlargement of the Trade Commissioner andQommereial Diplematis Services.Attention was called to the reaaumendatioa under (d)for the extension of the Trade Facilities Act, and objection was taken in f^tlealsr to no definite period being assigned to the proposed obligation of the Government to meet forthe first few years the whole or part of the interest charges on loans.the Cabinet agreed: -That a period of three years should befixed for the operation of this offer.^Objection was also taken to the recommendation4(c) that power should be given to proceed not only byguarantee but by direct advance of capital.It was explained that there was a definite limitef the amount ef guarantees and loans, vis. a further 25,000,000. making  50,000,000 in all;    and it wascontended that the country * e credit was not mere seriouslyprejudiced by the limited advances proposed than by the guarantees already approved.The Chancellor of the Exchequer entered at thisstage and his attention wae directed in particular tathe objection felt in regard to 4(c).
After further discussion, the Cabinet agreed:-To approve the interim recommendations of theCommittee subject to the Chancellor of theExchequer expressing his concurrence thereinafter he had had an opportunity of examiningthem,(MOTE:   In view of the great urgency of putting in force some ofthe recommendations, especially those dealing with LocalAuthorities&apos; Schemes, thehope was expressed that theChancellor vmld he able togive hie decision on Monday.)C  O  O  O  0  o  o  0  o  o   o  s  a  o2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.12th August 1922 .

TRAPS POLICY COMMITTEE, f--------                             IINTERIM REPORT TO THE CABINET.1. Tho Committee was appointed By the Cabinet onJuly 24th 1922 (Cabinet 41 (22) Conclusion 2), to examinethe question of British trade in all its boarings, witha view to the alleviation of unemployment. various proposals have been made to the Committee for the directrelief of unemployment ass distinct from proposals forindirect relief by means of the stimulation of trade.As these proposals required immediate consideration ifthey were to have any effect in the forthcoming winter, andas they had already been before the Unemployment Committee,the Trade policy  Committee thought it desirable toconsider them.ITERIM 2.        The Committee have held three meetings and dssireS0OMM3NDA-tONS OF THE in this Interim Report to make certain recommendationsjJMMITTBE.to the Cabinet which will, in their opinion, help to alleviate the unemployment situation.   Those recommendations are as follows1.      Land Bra in age and Improyemont.The Committee have had before them the recommendationof the Unemployment Committee set forth in a Memorandum bytho Minister of Health da tod July 25th, 1922 (C.P.4126) thatthe scheme of land drainage and improvement which was undertaken in relief of unemployment last winter should becontinued through the next winter In excoss of present commitments for rihich provision has been made in the estimates and in the/
and in the Supplementary Estimates made on July 18th, and that financial provision should.he made for them by a supplementary estimate to be presented in the Autumn.    The Committeeunderstand that last winter the land drainage and improvementschemes were well administered, and produced most successful results.     They employed on the average 5,000 to 5,000 mena week (including Scotland) and nearly 90 per cant, of themoney used ( 355,000 which includes a Government contribution of  9,700 to Water supply  schemes) was expended in wages. Tbatotal of men-weeks aocounted for by tho schemes was 148,500.The schemes carried out during last winter were closed down at the end of May since it was considered that agricultural labour Would absorb rural employed&apos;.during the summer. Similar schemes should therefore be started at latest by this end of Goto tor to deal with rural unemployment which, is expected to be severe, during tho next winter.Schemes of this kind are particularly important since theyare practically the only measures for relieving rural unemploy-ment-. - . - . .,... The Committee therefore recommend.... . .;That. the Ministry of Agriculture and fisheries and the Scottish Office should be authorised by the Cabinet to carry out during the next winter schemes of&apos; land drainage end Improvementsimilar to those carried out during last winter,and that the following financial provision should&apos;.. bo made, for these schemes by a supplementary estimate to be presented in the Autumn :-England and vJalcs  300,000Scotland (llths of 41.25080       300,000.) 341r 250The Committee do not desire to recommend at presentthat financial provision should be made for the carryingout of/-    2    - &apos;
out of Forestry-schemes during the next winter, as suggestedby the Unomployment Committee.2. . -Local Authorities Schemes.By dirac tion. of the Uremployment Committee and with&quot;the approval-of.the Chancellor of the Exchequer, a circularwas Issued on the 1st June, 1922, to local AuthoritiesRequesting particulars of the public works which they wouldbe prepared to. carry out in relief of unemployment onoondition that, a ;Government contribution on the same terms as before were made towards interest -and sinking fund.    Schemesestimated &quot;to. cost  20,000,000 are likely to be submitted by december. 31st 1922, and it. is thought that the St, Pavid&apos;sCommittee .wi..ll approve -75$ of these.The Committee recommend :-That the Cabinet should approve therecommendation of the Unemployment Committee(C.E.4126 para:2 (a)  ) that provision shouldbe made for: continuing the scheme for assisting Local Authorities in carrying outworks of public utility in relief ofunemployment,- by a contribution towardsinterest and sinking fund, on the same terms as before, to the,extent of 75$of the number of applications received up toBeoember 31st, 1922.  .. It is estimated thatthis would involve an average annual chargeof approximately  420,000 for a period of16 years.     The total capital cost of thoworks would -be  1550Q0V0Q0, of which the state would bear 65$ of the interest and sinkingfund.for a period of not more than 15 years on non-revenue producing schemes, and 5C$ of theinterest only for a period of 5 years on revenue producing schemes.     Bo provision forthis expenditure is necessary in the present financial year, since oven &apos;if work bogins onthe sohemeS by October 1st, 1922, Governmentliability for interest and sinking fund will-not accrue until the next financial year.
3. Training Centres for Emigrants.

The Committee have discussed the question of emigration and have been informed that various emigration schemes are now being negotiated by the Oversea Settlement Office with Dominion Governments. Until these negotiations are complete further action by the British Government would be superfluous. It has, however, been suggested that Training Centres should be established both in this country and in the Dominions for the purpose of giving elementary instruction in agricultural work to emigrants. The Committee understand that the best training is that given in the Dominions, and a recommendation has been made by the Oversea Settlement Committee that Dominion Governments should be urged to establish farm training centres overseas.

The Committee recommend:-

That the Cabinet should authorise the Oversea Settlement Committee to urge Dominion Governments to establish farm training centres overseas, but should take no steps at present to establish training centres in Great Britain.



4. Trade Facilities Act.

The Committee have been furnished with full details of the operation of the Trade Facilities Act and the Work of the Advisory Committee nominated by the Treasury.

Section 1 of the Act which enables the Treasury, subject to a total limit of £25,000,000, to guarantee the payment of interest and/or principal of a loan, the


the application of which is calculated to promoteemployment in the United Zlngdom, has served a purpose of substantial utility.Up to June 30th,  1922, guarantees were approvedto the amount of  1? Million sterling and it isestimated that employment amounting to 879,000 men -months will be given on work set going under the Act*It appears, however, that owing to the change offinancial, conditions -which has taken place in thelast year the powers granted by the Act are not sufficient now to stimulate the carrying out ofworks likely, to produce employment-    The onlypower which the Act granted was to guarantee loans,the inducement held out being the saying of thedifference between the higher rate at whichcapital could be got On the unsupported credit of the undertaking and the lower rate at whichit could he got with &amp; Government guarantee.Money is now cheap and this inducement amountsto little.    The GomMttee accordingly appointed aSubcommittee to consider how the sdope of the Actshould be extended in order to deal With thepresent situation, and the relative sections ofthe Sub-Committee1s Report are appended hereto.It will be seen that the Bub-CommitteeTsrecommendations are as follows that
That tha I&apos;rade Facilities Act should he amendeden the following lines t-(a)   to enable the -G&amp;VQ&amp;WXSBft&apos; to meei forthe first few years of the career ofund^rt-axings the whole or part Of theinterest charges on hearts to be raisedby Statutory Authorities and Companies,in this country or by foreign andcalojiial governments;&apos;&quot;(h)   as regards undertsltings ef localAuthorities the form of assistaheasuggested in (a) should be treated asan alternative to the present schemefor &quot;desisting -the revenua^r^xioingworks of Local Authorities with partof interest charges; &apos;(c) pnwer should be given te proceed riot*nly by guarantee but by direct advance.    of capital required;(d) the administration of the Act sc* faras concerns public utility propositionsput forward by Statutory Authorities and companies and propositions for loans to- foreign and colonial Governments should&apos;. be transferred to the Departments..concerned, and each Department should accept responsibility for surveying its*wn part of the field, for stimulatingapplications,  and for reehmmending- them to the Treasury if approved.;(e) &quot;as to propositions from ordinal,competitive profit barning compahies.,ho change should be made in the existing powers of the Act or in &quot;the machineryby which these powers are exercised;(f) the limit of the amount for guaranteesadd loaus should be increased from  2-5 million sterling to  50 million sterling,and the time limit for the operationof -the Act should be extended by ibmonths;(g) power should be taken to create an insurance Pond &apos; to /compensate for possiblelosses by charging a premiumr*r otherwise.jThe -O^emmittee recommendt-. $hat the above- proposals,should be. sanctionedby the Cabinet.- f- -
5.    Enlargement of Trade Commissioner and CommercialDip 1 oma tic S e rvi c e s...In order to promote British exports.various proposals have been put forward,by .the secretary to the.Overseas trade department which willIf adopted,&apos;. strengthen the trade commissioner and the&apos;Commercial Diplomatic -Services.     Theseproposals are as followsProposal. ; Estimated Cost.Canada,.Establishment of a trade commissioner&apos;s Office at .Vancouver.   . ... -  3,700 per annum.Increase of travelling jiand office allowances of                        ;;  ;Canadian Trade Commissioners.  1,700 per annum.Publicity, mainly, in Canada,.    , ... -&apos; 1,500Despatch of Trade Experts to.     -Canada for one year  7,300Participation in Canadian -.&apos;  .&apos; .Agricultural Shows. -   1,000-                  ..j India; -Establishment of a Trade . ..Commissioner&apos;s Office atBombay. ,.     ... - - -&apos; 3&apos;; 900 per annum.Appointment of a Second Grade ;&quot; , &apos;Trade Commissioner at Calcutta.  1,800 per annum.British East ^Africa,Retention of Trade &quot; --        . .Commissioner1 a Office. ------ - :--    4,500. per annum.Australia-   - v* ;:&apos;:&apos;Increase in travelling and office allowances.....  250 per annum...Argentina.    - ; -Additional clericalassistance. :.   v-v ..      -t      -  630Brazil,Appointment of a.

Proposal.$Retention of CommercialSecretary at Tehran.Retention of CommercialSecretary.at Lisbon,Persia., Portugal.Estimated Cost. 2,570 per annum. 1,900 per annum,The Secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade alsostates that he Is considering what steps should be taken toincrease the absorption of British manufactures by tb.6 UnitedStates, and has informed the Committee that a sum of  3,000may be required either, for, strengthening the consxilar service in the United States, or for sending out a special Investigator,He also suggests that a Commercial Secretary may shortly haveto be appointed at Mexico City at an estimated cost of  3,100per annum with a non-recurring expenditure of  825.     He there-fore proposes the provisional inclusion of a sum of  2,000 in; the&quot;Supplementary Estimate for the current year.As regards Chili, it is suggested that as soon as traderevives the post of Commercial Secretary in Chili should be restored at a cost of  3,150 per annum, the non-recurringexpendlttxre of re-establishment being an additional  1,300.The Committee are Informed that the total &quot;cost of theproposals made by the Secretary to the Department ef OverseasTrade would in 1922-23 amount to  23,230 and in 1923-24 38,170.     The grounds for these proposals have been fully explained to the Committee, and they afe much impressed withthe relative smallness of the expenditure as compared withthe magnitude of the return which may be anticipated.They therefore recommend:-(1) That the Cabinet should approve as a temporary expedient for two years the. proposals made bythe Secretary to the Department of OverseasTrade for the increase of the Trade commissioner and Commercial Diplomatic Services:(2) That the proposals in question and their recom-mendation, should be brought to the notice ofthe Economy Committee presided over by theChancellor of the Exchequer.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.12th August,  1922.(Sgd).

Extract from Report of the Sub^ C-orrjr.it tee appointedto ccns-i&amp;er the operation of &quot;Section 1- of the TradeFacilities Act, 1921.xx xxx x x5.    The propositions put before the AdvisoryCommittee for assistance under the Act fall into three main divisions:- -  .(a) Public utility propositions put forward&apos;by  &apos;-Statutory Authorities and Companies (Transport,cower, light, water irrigation, drainage)..   : . .(b) Propositions froni ordinary ;competitive profitearning.Compani.es (typically manufacturingconcerns)&quot;. -  &apos; -(c) Propositions for loans to Foreign and ColonialGeverhment3.6,,    With class (b), the Advisory Committee hasexperienced cohsiderable.difficulty in dealing.     Thonumber of applications has been disappointing and forthe most part they have been for undesirable speculativeventures; &apos;    Inherent difficulties have also disclosedthemselves in including&apos;.such undertakings under the Act.The difficulty of securing continuous good managementgravely affects the security.     The guarantee of aconcern; the profits of which, are not limited, involvesin substance making a present to private interests.This provokes criticism and opposition from competitorsand the general public which has already made itselfheard In Parliament?7t On the other hand, assistance to classes.(a)and (c) is free from these disadvantages. Their profitsare often limited; their continuity is assuredj&quot;and thepublic benefits more directly from the help given. Withfew exceptions, it. is in&apos; these&apos;&apos; last- two classes- of under-taking that the&apos; larger propositions are to. be found whichwould be of most direct benefit to employment..    /It
8. -It seems therefore desirable that any greaterfacilities than those hitherto provided under the Act shouldbe confine1 to classes (a) and (c).       To give further helpsuch as that described below to class (b) would be criticised on the grounds tha t undue benefits were being conferred on private Interests.     Experience of the working of the Actsuggests that what is needed for classes (aV and (c) is thatthe Government should be prepared to meet whole or part ofthe interest charges on the loans to be raised for the first few years (say three, or at most five) of the career of theundertaking.     Conditions might be imposed requiring re-isa^rtftontof such interest out of profits in excess of some substantial amount.      Tt is usual, no doubt, to add such charges to capital end thus to spread their incidence.     But the contribution-of such interest charges,  which might amount tosay 10% or 15$ of fre   capital,  would nevertheless be a sub-stantial bonus, and might be expected to bring to the birtha considerable number of largo undertakings,  and especially of colonial undertakings.9.&quot;As regards undertakings of Local Authorities, theform of assistance suggested above should be treated as analternative to the present scheme for assisting the revenue-producing works of Local Authorities with part of interest charges.10. Further, the Act provides, e s said, for guaranteeonly.     This financial machinery has not been foundsufficiently elastic to fulfil the purposes of the Act.Further powers are need 3d to adapt the form of the help tobe given to the needs of the case.     In particular, some method/
method is required to meet the case of undertakings forwhich a public issue is unsuitable.     That could be netby giving power to proceed, not only by guarantee; butby a direct advance of the capital required,11.(b)    The work of the Advisory Committee, which is responsible for passing applications under the Act, hasbeen performed with the greatest ability and assiduitycBut it is proved to be more ai*duous and to require agreater sacrifice of time than any voluntary organisationcan fairly be expected to give.     Further, a voluntaryCommittee has neither the staff nor the authority necessaryto take the initiative in stimulating scheme s.is. For these reasons it appears desirable that theadministration of the Act, in so far as classes (a) and(c) are concerned, should be transferred to executivedepartments.      No single department is In a position tocover the whole field..    The most efficient method ofadministration would be as follows :-       That each of thefollowing Departments, the India Office, the ColonialOffice, the Board of Trade, the Papartment of OverseasTrade, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of transport should accept responsibility for surveying its own part ofthe field , for stimulating applications, and for recommend!them to the Treasury, if approved.     The function of theTreasury as regards the recommendations from the departments would be the same as that which it now exercises asregards recommendations from the Advisory Committee.     Inorder to facilitate applications by the public they mightbe made in the first case, as at present, to the Secretaryof the Advisory Committee.As/
13, As regards Class  (b), It-does not seem desirable to make any change either in the existing powers under the Acre or in tho machinery ^ which those powers are exercised,    . Both economically and politicallythere would be objections to extending to this class thenew facilities suggested above for classes (a) and (c);and the retention Of administration as regards this classin the hands of an outside b*dy with a semi-judicial positionis very desirable in order to prevent any suspicion ofpartiality..14o The Act confined the amount of the loans to be guaranteed to 25 million sterling and the time during whichguarantees might be given to 12 months (expiring 10th November1922),      If a fresh impetus is to be. given to the work inthe particulars suggested above^ it will be necessary to enlarge those limits.      It is suggested that the limit ofamount for guarantees and loans should be increased to50 million and the time extended for another year,I5o  It appears desirable that power should be taken(which does not at present exist),, by charging a -premium or&apos;&apos;otherwise, to create an Insurance Fund to compensate for possible lossese2S Whitehall Gardens,-,s.w.,9th August,  1922,
