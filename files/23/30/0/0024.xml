IffTjtOjrS.     (1) With reference to Cabinet 45(22), the Cabinetmet at short notice to consider further the positionresulting from the deadlock which had arisen at the Inter-Allied Conference on Reparations.THE PRIME MINISTER stated that he was sorry tohave to inform his colleagues that it had not been found possible to reach an agreement with the French delegation on the questions at issue.     On Saturday last the Expertshad examined the proposals under the chairmanship of theChancellor of the Exchequer and haa failed to reaehagreement;    indeed the longer the discussion, the greater the divergence of view.     Yesterday M. Sehanaer and otherpexAsons had attempted to arrive at a compromise on thebasis of an adjournment of the Conference until after theAllied delegates had returned from the United States ofAmerica, and were in possession of settled views on thequestion of European debts to America.     There was a gooddeal to be said for this suggestion which would have beencordially supported by the British delegates.    The only question was9 what was to happen as regards the monthlypayments due from Germany under the Cannes Agreement?   Thewhole of the Allied delegates, with the exception of theFrench were willing that there should be a temporarymoratorium until the return of the Allied delegates from america.     On M.Poincare*s rejection of this plan, it hadbeen suggested as an alternative, that the question of thetemporary moratorium should be left to the ReparationCommission, which it must be remembered was the machineryset up under the Treaty of Versailles to deal with thisquestion.   Had this latter proposal been adopted, theReparation Commission might have granted a moratoriumafter first hearing the Germans.
M.Poinsare had remained quite obdurate in spite ofvigorous pressure from the other delegations.   In faot,M.Poincare* would grant no unconditional moratorium.     It hadbeen pointed out that if the Conference was, as suggested,adjourned until November, Germany would, under the Cannesarrangements have to make three monthly payments totalling150 millions of gold marks and approximately a further150 millions of gold marks In respect of private debts,making 300 millions of gold marks altogether.     If, as -seemednot unlikely, Germany proved unable to make these payments,then the Allies would be in the difficult situation of having to enforce sanctions prior to the holding of theadjourned Conference.        M.Poincard*s obduracy was, no doubt,due to the fact that the French Press relied on him to carryout the policy which he had consistently urged prior to taking office and many important French newspapers were nowexhorting him to stand firm.   He probably was doubtful as tothe best course to adopt. In the end the british delegates had offered the following four propositions:-(1)   That the Conference should adjourn until November.(2)   That the Reparation Commission should be entrusted with the question of the monthly payments to be made in the interval before the holding of the adjourned Conferences(3)   That all the guarantees decided upon by theCommittee of Guarantees should be put into(4)    That until the adjourned Conference had met and come to a decision, Great Britain wouldnot press her European debtors for principalor interest on their debts.The Allies Delegations, with the exception of the French,had accepted these propositions.     M.Theunis had pointed outthat the refusal of the French to accept them meant a rupture, but M.PoinoarC had represented that a meredifference/
difference of opinion did not necessarily involve a rupture.He had intimated that the French Cabinet had not yetdeliberated on the position and certainly that no decisionhad yet been taken by the French Government which would necessitate any breakdown of the Alliance.     The truth wasthat M&apos;.poincare* himself was undecided as to his future lineof action and had oome to the conclusion that, on the whole,it would be better for Mm to return to France without anagreement than with an agreement which did not give Mmeverything he asked for.   . In these circumstances, theBritish Delegates felt that no useful purpose would be served by continuing the conversations. On the subject of inter-Allied indebtedness, S.Sohanaer had been sounded onthe proposal to reduce very substantially Italy&apos;s debt toGreat Britain, but he had shorn no enthusiasm for this Ideaand was clearly looking for a total cancellation of Italy&apos;sindebtedness.        If Great Britain was to fall in withM.Poincare&apos; It was clear that, on Germany3s default, Braneewould insist on the fulfilment of the most stringentconditions and,, in every respect, Great Britain would beplaced In a highly embarrassing and unsatisfactory position.the full Council, MePoineard having intimated thatdisagreement at a full meeting would invest the breakdownFrench Government had decided to take separate action asa result of the breakdown.Commission had decided to postpone consideration ofGermany1s request for a moratorium pending the conclusionIt was not proposed to hold a further meeting ofShe Cabinet were reminded that the ReparationM.Polncar^ hadabsolutely/
absolutely rejected the proposal that the question of themoratorium and the conditions, if any, to he imposed upon germany should he left to the Reparation Commission,In a discussion at the Commission it was not improbable thatFranee and Belgium would take one side and Croat Britainand Italy the other.   In as much as the Chairman of theCommission was a Frenchman and possessed the easting vote,the decision might be given against us.   On the other hand,it was pointed out that the Belgian Delegate would not favour extreme courses in as much as Belgium was as opposed as ever to the taking of military measures inGermany.tier-Allied The Cabinet were invited to consider the question^elatedness.of Inter-Allied indebtedness, in relation to the presentsituation regarding the question of reparations.   It was urged that while no doubt at the moment neither France norItaly would entertain any proposals which Great britain could offer as regards the cancellation of debt, yet therewas much to be said for Great Britain making at the&apos; presenttime a fair&apos; and reasonable offer so that it could not be urged against her that she had taken no step in this direction and had allowed the collapse of Germany and the deterioration of the European situation without making any concreteproposals to her debtors.   The question should be considered from both the external and the internal points of view.As regards the external situation it was vital that thereshould be a financial and economic settlement of Europe andthe only possible way in which this could be effected was by raising a substantial sum of money equivalent to thecapitalisation of Germany1s capacity to pay.   The chiefobstacle in the way was that in the present state of uncertainty no financial interests would advance money even to a privileged and priority reparations creditor.   The totalreparations
reparations figures were far too excessive and the Committeeof Bankers had made it clear that the Reparation Committeewould have some day or other to reduce the aggregate figure to about 2,500 millions sterling.    It was certain that Francecould not agree to any such reduction unless it was accompanied by a corresponding reduction of Inter-Alliedindebtedness,   There was much to be said for the view that thebest course for Great Britain to adopt would he to surrenderher advances to the Allies in exchange for some small cashpayments.   As regards the internal situation Great britain was faced with a substantial deficit next year; in spite of theefforts of the Economy Committees there was little doubt thata substantial deficit would remain.   On this ground alone,it would be important if Great Britain could participate inthe funds to be raised by loan.    The Balfour lots had indicated the general line of policy Adopted by the British Government andthe question was whether we had really examined as fully andas carefully as we might do the whole question of Inter-Allied debts so that we could say sincerely that there was noproposition which we could ne-ke to our Allies which if adoptedwould help to ease the situation.    Should franee take any extremestep it was most undesirable that she should lay the blame of having had to do so on Great britain&apos;s failure to make a reason-able proposition regarding Inter-Allied debts.     In these   \circumstances it might be desirable to inform the Allieddelegates that proposals were under consideration; which would besubmitted to them on their return home.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the UnitedStates of America were pressing Great Britain for the paymentof debt and accumulated interest amounting in all to about 1,050 millions and that the considered view of the Cabinet hadbeen that if Great Britain was to be pressed for payment ofthis sum,  she in turn must in her own interests press faer debtor
Allies.   The-essence of the Balfour Mote which represented the considered view of the Cabinet was that it should be brought home to the United States of America that the delay in thereconstruction of Barope and the chaotic financial and economic condition of the world, was attributable in the main to america&apos;s debt policy.   The relief to Prance and the other allies would be at Great Britain&apos;s sole expense and theopportunity would be lost of utilising the debt due to GreatBritain^ia our forthcoming negotiations with the United Statesof America.    It was also pointed out that it would not he right and proper for the Government to take any far-reaching decisionon the question in the absence of Ministers who had taken avery prominent and leading part in the policy mmbodied in the balfour Sole.Secondly, it was quite dear that no proposition that Great Britain could now make would he entertained for a mount by her debtor Allies.     Neither MoSchanzer nor M.poincare dared go back to Italy or Prance after having acceptedany kind of settlement of Inter-Allied indebtedness based onpayments.     Participation by Great Britain in a loan would ineffect mean that Prance and Italy had began to make payments inrespect of their debt.     These countries had no intentionwhatever of ever paying anything to Ireat Britain or America,and this being so they would regard themselves as in a worse position if they undertook, directly or indirectly, an obligation to liquidate any of their debt.    It would not bepossible later on to make a higher offer, and this being so,Great Britain would have made her best offer for nothing, andwould have failed to impress Europe and Briti sh public opinion which might represent that the British Government had brokenwith France on a beggarly minimum, while, no doubt, theGovernment would be criticised   by another section of public6. opinion
opinion for surrendering tho main portion of the debt.   Inany case any offer made now would be taken as a starting-point by our debtors later on.Thirdly, it was not perhaps altogether regrettable thatthere should be a breach at the moment.   During the last three years the Allies had avoided open zuptures by meansof concessions and compromises which had been mainly illusory.The time had come to endeavour to get a final settlement.It would be a good thing for France to face realities, andthe &quot;Temps&quot; had that morning warned Prance that she could notquarrel with Germany and Great Britain at the same time.The British proposals would be published, and were simple ,proposals which all could readily understand.   Public opinioncould not comprehend proposals involving complicated calcu-^-lations respecting inter-Allied debts.   There was no doubt/the British Government had adopted the right course, and france must now face the situation and take responsibilityfor failure upon herself.   Up to now she had always beenable to blame her Allies, particularly for the reductions which had been made in the claims on Germany.   Prance would undoubtedly shrink from -responsibility, and in any ease wouldbe unable to smash up Germany before November,   It would bea mistake from every point, of view to depart in any respectfrom the position previously taken %ip by the Cabinet, or tofritter away the policy embodied in the Balfour Note.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the policy proposed regarding inter-Allied debts was based on that con-tained in the Balfour Note, and particularly on the proposi-tion that Great Britain&apos;s claim against Prance could only bereduced if the United States made at the same time a similarconcession respecting her debt. This policy would also castupon America the responsibility for the European situatL on.
If the propos-al only amounted to  100/ Great Britain shovildsharo in it, and there was much to he said for an arrangement under which the debt of France and Italy to Great britain should only be paid out of reparation receipts.The Cabinet were reminded that at the first meeting ofthe Conference M. Poincare had said that he had a plan which dealt with reparations and also with inter-Allied indebted-ness, under which a very substantial reduction of repara-tions would be possible and the Committee of Bankers couldbe summoned to resume the consideration-tion of the reparationloan.   Nothing more had been beard of this plan, but inthe event of a rupture the British Government might be criticised for not having examined it, and the question was whether it would not be possible for the plan to be pub-lished with the British comments upon it.The Cabinet were informed that the plan in question \?asa ridiculous and insulting one, and that it was clear thatM* Poincare, after reading the Bad four Mote, realised thatit was useless to produce it.   Under the plan, France andItaly were to liquidate their debt to Great Britain by pay-ment in HGn bonds, a quite worthless security.   On the otterhand, Great Britain was to pay the United States and give upall claims for reparation.   As things had turned out, itmight have bean a good tactical move to have asked to seeMf poincare*8 plan early in the Conference, but the british delegates had looked only to secure a settlement and had notwished to pl&amp;ee M. Pcincare in difficulties.The suggestion was made that public opinion might takethe vie?/ that the Conference had broken down owing to thedesire of the British Government to let Germany off.   On theother hand, it was pointed out that throughout the proceed-ings the British delegates had taken the view that it was forthe Reparation Commission to judge of what Germany could pay and when she was in default?   that this was a machinery setup byrthe Treaty?   and that Great Britain had constantlyappealed to the Treaty.   In short, France was breaking withGreat Britain because Great Britain refused to violate theTreaty.
The importance was represented of theBritish point of view heing fully and carefully statedin the Press.    In particular, it was urged that thereshould he published the British, proposals and thereasons why the British Delegates had stood by theTreaty and the public should be informed that, after having failed to reach agreement in all other directions. Great Britain had offered to abide bythe decision of the Separation Commission or theLeague of Hations.     It should also be made clearthat the present Conference was an extra TreatyConference summoned at the express request ofMoPoincare&quot; notwithstanding that the views of theBritish Government were in favour of the Conferencebeing held at a later date.    It was also represented that the public should, be informed as to the personnel and functions of the Reparation Commission.     TheCabinet agreed:-To request the Prime Minister to arrangefor the publication of the British caseon the lines indicated in the discussion.After some further discussion, in the courseof which it was pointed out that if the ReparationCommission decided that Germany was in defaulta very serious situation would arise and the allies would have to consider the question of the impositionof further sanctions, the   Cabinet agreed:-To take note of and approve the actionRespecting reparations taken by the-British Belegates at the meetings with the Allied Delegates.
0TEB-ALLIEBBritish mission to United Statesof America.2. With reference to 0ahinet4.2( 22) tconclusion3 , and arising out of the foregoingdiscussion on Inter-Allied indebtedness and thereparation question, the Cabinet agreed:-That the Chancellor of the exchequer should be the chief British Delegateat the forthcoming washington conference on Inter-Allied indebtednessand that he should have full discretion to deal with the question -on the general lines indicated inthe Cabinet discussions on the subject./
&apos;wk COHDITIOH   3.    With reference to Cabinet 37 (ZZ) Conclusion 5,01&quot; AUSTRIA.the Cabinet were informed it had been agreed to considerthe question of Austria at a meeting of the Inter-allied conference that afternoon.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that altogetlf-er Great Britain had advanced between  10,000,000 to 15,000,000 to Austria since the Armistice without any satisfactory results.    Austria was in a very disturbed&apos;condition.     Wages were -very high and the army was full of Communists which indeed was the chief cause of the unrest in the country.       A proposition had been made that Great Britain should undertake the conduct of thecountry which would be a very costly arrangement fromthe financial point of view.     Reference was made to thelarge claims made by franco in respect of Austria and themeagre -contributions made by her in response to Austriafsclaims for. financial assistance,,     Owing to the fact thatthe United States of America had only recently agreedto release her share of the lien on Austria5s assets, theopportunity offered. 18 months ago had been lost- of effect-ing any settlement of the financial.situation.The view of the Governor of the Bank of England,which was shared by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,&quot;wasthat nothing possible remained to he done and that itwould be necessary to leave Austria to her fate.The all ine t agr eed: -That the Prime Minister should have full discretion fo deal as he thought bestwith the Austrian situation at the meetingof the Inter-Allied Conference to be.heldat 5.0 p.m. that day.
