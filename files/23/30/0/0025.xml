Empire.After further discussion, the Cabinet agreed -(a) That 4 (a) should read:-&quot;To enable the Government to meet, forthe first three years of the career of undertakings, tho whole or part of theinterest charges on loans to be raisedby statutory authorities and companies in this country or by Colonial government-ments&quot;.(b) That 4 (c) should be omitted,and that theremaining reeenmsendatiens under 4 shouldbe adopted:(c) That the recommendation for advancingcapital should be dropped tor the present,on the understanding that,&apos; should it laterbe thought necessary to assist special schemes by advances of capital, the matter should be reconsidered by the Cabinet.
Land Drainage and Improvement.



The Chancellor of the Exchequer expressed doubt as to the advisability of spending further money on land drainage and improvement, as recommended by the Trade Policy Committee.

The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, and the Secretary for Scotland, reminded the Cabinet of the psychological importance of doing something to help unemployed agricultural labourers who were outside insurance schemes and were apt to feel that they were overlooked in favour of the urban unemployed.

Statistics were given of the work already done in rendering waterlogged areas productive.

It was explained that the Committee had made no recommendation in regard to forestry, in as much as the immediate benefits to the unemployed were greater from land drainage schemes.

After further discussion --

The Cabinet approved the recommendation of the Trade Policy Committee which provided for an expenditure in England and Wales of £300,000 and in Scotland of £41,250.

Local Authorities&apos; Schemes.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer, having called attention to the serious financial outlook of the country, took strong objection to the proposal of the Trade Policy Committee that provision should be made for a further capital expenditure of £15,000,000 on Local Authorities&apos; schemes, under Lord St. Davids&apos; Committee. He had already agreed to a sum of £20,000,000, which he had been assured would cover the schemes in hand. If Local Authorities were being stimulated to produce further schemes, it would be impossible to continue assistance from the Treasury, and it was unfair to use the irritation and disappointment felt by Local Authorities as a means of exercising pressure on the Treasury.

 


In reply te the Prime Minister it. waa explained that theschemes- iiwol^ed work on roads, tramways, waterworks, and similar municipal undertakings*The Prime Minister expressed Ms apprehension that thenature of the schemes waa highly artificial, temporary andintend.ad rather as a sop to the unemployed than as a per-manent addition to the productive power of the State*   he feared that the misnlcipalities were missing a very good opportunity ef improving the amenities ef the country.The Secretary of state for War, the Minister of Labour,and the Secretary for Scotland, laid great emphasis on thefact that a number of towns were.either in the position ofBarrow ex&quot; approximating to it, whare tha Local authorities were refusing to grant farther out-door relief, and that ifthe schemes before Lord St. Pavida* Committee were stopped,&quot;an epidemic of Barrows* would be certain to fellow.It was felt Impossible to carry the discussion to a final conclusion in the absence of the Minister of Health.The Cabinet agreed -Ca) That the Treasury should authorise a.. further capital - sum of  10,000,000instead of the  15,000,OCC recommendedby the Committeesf:b) fhat Lord St. Bavids&apos; Committee shouldbe instructed te select the best peasi-ble schemes, and postpone tho consider-at ion of the reminder, endeavouring atthe Same time to avoid more 4l0*ppeint-ment among the Local Authorities than was inevitable&apos;.(c) That Lord St. Davids&apos; Committee shouldbe requested to furnish the Trade PolicyCommittee with a precise description ofthe main types ef &quot;municipal work whichwere being approved by them,(d) That the whole position should be reviewedon October 1st.
