(1) The Lord Privy Seal brought before the Cabinet a petition laid before him by certain Members of Parliamentdealing with the refusal of the Speaker to allow questions to be asked and. the Adjournment moved on matters relatingto the lives and property of &quot;British subjects in Ireland,and asking for the matter to be dealt with by a new Stand-ing Order or otherwise (Paper C.P.-5982).   mhe Lord privy seal read the draft of a reasoned reply to the Petitioners,explaining the inability of the Government to interfere in the Speaker&apos;s ruling in the manner suggested.The view was expressed that some concession oughtto be made in the matter to Members of Parliament, many ofv/hom were being heavily pressed on the subject by people in Ireland who were suffering under the present State of disorder.    In support of this view it was pointed out thatthe British Government still held troops in Dublin,&apos; while in the Northern&apos;area the British Government, by payingpart of the cost of the police forces, had definite responsibility-responibilities there.    Further, it was urged that parliamentary discussion and Questions had a salutary effect both inSJorth and South Ireland.    The Government in Dublin, it waspointed out, was still a provisional one and without pro-cedsnt in our history, and it was suggested that it wouldbfdsefu.1 to write to the Speaker and draw attention tothe fact that Southern Ireland had not yet reached thefull status of a Self-governing Dominion.It was explained that where Crown servants inBritish pay were employed in the Southern area, the Speakerwould allow Questions in relation to them, but where thematter was one of the general maintenance of law and order the Speaker contended that that duty had been transferredto the Provisional Government, and he had to bear in mind
the position of the British Dominions generally in suchmatters.   Tho Cabinet were reminded of the attempt, forexample, to raise certain recent South African Labourtroubles.    In regard to Northern Ireland, the Speaker hadmodified his ruling ttten his attention had been drawn tothe fact that we were paying for police, for whom a Votehad been presented to the &quot;ouse.    In the South we were under no such pecuniary burden or responsibility.After some discussion as to the extent to whichsimilar questions and discussions were permissible in thecase of the Self-governing Dominions and foreign countries,the Cabinet agreed  That the lord Privy Seal should reply tothe Members of Parliament who had sub-scribed to the Petition, on the lines ofthe draft letter read by him to theCabinet, giving the reasons why the Gov-ernment could not intervene in the matter;but he was asked, in addition, to call attention to the number of occasions onwhich Irish questions had b^en freelyventilated in Parliament, and to statethat there was no desire to curtail theseopportunities.-2
fa) With reference to Cabinet SS (32), the Cabinet had before there a draft, circulated on the previous day and published in the morning newspapers, of the Constitutionof the Irish Pree State (Paper G.P.-40S4).The Secretary of State for the Colonies gave hiscolleagues a full account of the rapid development ofevents since the Cabinet had last considered the question.The Irish representatives had conceded the six points whichthe Cabinet had regarded as essential.   He then summarised the changes which had been introduced in the draft Consti-button, and called. pax*ticular attention to those which had resulted from the Conferences with the Southern Unionists,^e also stated that the draft had been approved by the LordChancellor and hj the Solicitor-General (in the absenceof the Attorney-General).After some discussion the Cabinet agreed (a) To approve&apos;the Draft Constitution:(b) To place on record their congratulationsand. thanks to the Ministers who had been engaged in these negotiations, and moreparticularly the Secretary of State forthe Colonies:((c) ^o request the Secretary to convey thethanks of the Cabinet to the Lord chief justice for his assistance:(d) To request the Secretary of State for theColonies to express the Cabinet&apos;s apprecia-tion of the services rendered by sir frederick Liddell, Sir Francis Greer andthe other officials who had been concernedin the negotiations.
$GUARDING- (??) With reference to Gabinet 34 (32), Conclusion 2,industries the Cabinet agreed  That a Cabinet Committee, composed asfollows:-The President of the Board of Trade .(in the Chair),The Minister of Health,The Minister of Rdueati on,The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,The First Commissioner of Works,The Paymaster-General,The Parliamentary Secretary to theBoard of Trade,Fir T. St. Q,. Hill (Secretary) -should meet to investigate the working ofthe Safeguarding of Industries Act, and,in addition, to consider the presentation to the public of the case in favour of the-powers conferred hy this Act, not merely asregards tMsfcrvalue at present and in theimmediate future, but also in the more dis-tant future.
$ALT? (4) With reference to Cabinet 11 (92), Conclusions 1 and  2, the Cabinet had before them Memoranda by the First Lordposed Wages&apos; jtiona.     of the Admiralty (Paper G .P.-3980), the Minister of Labour(Paper C.P.-3994) aftd the Chancellor of the Exchequer (paper c.P.-3999)oThese Memoranda dealt with the difficult situationwhich, had arisen in the Naval Dockyards and similar estab-lishments owing to the fact that wages had been reduced byagreement in the shipbuilding industry but not in the engin-eering industry.    The special difficulty at present arose from the fact that there has never been, in Royal Dockyardsand Admiralty establishments, any differentiation as betweenworkmen according to the industries to which they might bedeemed to belong, and it was important to maintain the equitable assessment of wages afptaed according to therelative values of the workpeople in the same establish-ments.    If the Admiralty followed the outside arrangements in regard to shipbuilders and reduced wages by 16s.6d.,there would be a saving of  13,000 per week.    If theyapplied the reduction to the shipbuilders and engineers,by the admiralty the reduction would be  44,000 a week.    It was proposed/toput forward an interim all-round reduction of 12s .6d. perweek, which would secure a saving of  33,750 per week.This, ff&apos; was believed, would cause less trouble and securegreater economy than differentiation, and the men were thought to prefer equal reductions all over to sectionalreductions.Against this proposal it was urged (l) that theproposed reduction was 4/- a week less than that arranged with the shipbuilders, and (8)  that to insist on a reduc-tion of 12s.6&amp;. per week for the&apos;engineers, in advance ofthe conclusion of any such arrangement outside by theA.E.U., woxtld be certain to create widespread criticism
of the Government, who would be denounced as being in leaguewith the employers in bringing about a fall in wages.    Itwas therefore suggested that the best way out &apos;of the diffi-culty was to lay the position frankly before the joint industrial Council and attempt to secure an amicable settlement as rapidly as possible in the interests of economy.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Admiralty should at once open negotiations with the Joint IndustrialCouncil:fb) T^hat the Minister of Labour should beinvited to attend and take part in thene^otiati one:Co) That the First Lord of the Admiralty andthe Minister of Labour should keep in the closest possible touch with the Chancellorof the Exchequer throughout the negotiations.-6-
I POPLAR (5)    The Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum&quot;[$TRY *by the Minister of Health (Paper G.P.-3970) covering theReport of the Enquiry recently held into the administration-   of the Poplar Borough Council.   The Cabinet were informedthat the letter indicated in Paper 0.P.-S970 had beensent by the Ministry of Health to the Borough Council andthat it was not improbable that certain difficult andtroublesome questions might come up for decision.The Cabinet agreed  that the Minister of Health should have discretion to deal with the Poplar case.-7-
(6) The Cabinet had under consideration a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C.P.4020) relative to the question of the policy to be adopted in dealing with the request of the United States Government that Great Britain should put forward ? proposals for funding the debt by the British Government to the United States Government.

The Cabinet were reminded that Great Britain was under a definite obligation to convert the existing debt into long term bonds "if required by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States of America". The United States Government had appointed a World War Foreign Debt Commission and this Commission had on the 18th April 1922 adopted the  following resolutions :-

"Resolved that the Secretary of State be requested to inform each of the Governments whose obligations arising out of the World War are held by the United States, including obligations held by the United States Grain Corporation, the War Department, the Navy Department or the American Relief Administration, of the organisation of the World War Foreign Debt Commission, pursuant to Act of Congress approved the 9th February 1922, and that the Commission desires to receive any proposals or representations which the said Government may wish to make for the settlement or refunding of its obligations under the provisions of the Act."

It was the universal opinion of those best qualified to know that whatever attitude the United States Government might adopt towards France, Italy, Belgium and its other European debtors it would grant no relaxation to Great Britain in the matter of repayment of debt. There was no hope of any modification of this attitude in the near future and public opinion in America had tended recently to harden on the subject. The Debt Commission had only been given very limited powers, and its principal duty would be to settle
the problem of exchanging the existing payment obligations by which the British debt is represented into bonds or other obligations maturing on or before 15th June 1927.

It was represented to the Cabinet that there was nothing to be gained by delaying the opening of negotiations with the United States Government as proposed in the memorandum. On the other hand any delay would be likely to create fresh difficulties. Great Britain was mainly interested in reaching a settlement in Europe, and this settlement could not be effected until the Reparation question had been settled. France, however, would not settle the Reparation question until she knew definitely what the position would be as to her debt to Great Britain and the United States. There was no chance of the United States assisting in the settlement of the European problem until they had made definite arrangements with Great Britain which they rightly regarded as their only solvent debtor. In these circumstances it was argued that any delay in dealing with the matter meant further postponement of European reconstruction.

Any proposal involving the policy of requiring France, Italy and Great Britain&apos;s other European debtors to fund their debts would simply mean increased reluctance on the part of France to make any Reparation concessions to Germany with the result that the latter country would go bankrupt and European revival would be indefinitely postponed. It must, however, be realised that if the British debt to the United States Government was at once funded it would be most difficult, if not impossible, to prevent the funded debt being placed on the market and once this was done Great Britain would most certainly be required to pay up the whole of the debt.
In this connection, however, it was urged that while,no doubt, the British Government had agreed to the fundingof the debt and to the payment to the United States G-overn-ment or its assigns, it was still open to the British Gov-ernment to negotiate with a view to preventing, if possible,the funded debt being placed on the market.    On the general question it was urged that, however unconscionable we thought the attitude of the United States Government tobe, yet it -would be incompatible with our national horararand credit to refuse to pay, and that it was inconceivablethat Great Britain would ever place herself in the humiliat-Ing position of being in fact a defaulter to America.On the other hand, it was urged that Great Britain shouldtake up the position that in no circumstances ought she tobe given a less favourable treatment than that accorded bythe United States Government to her other European debtors.Tn particular, it was most desirable that in this matterEurope should present to America a united front, and thatthe latter should not be allowed to settle with her debtorsindividually.   Even if the United States would not relaxher demands upon Great Britain, she might possibly be persuaded, as the result of a general settlement, to give/move lenient treatment to her other debtors.    Prom this/point-of view it would be most unfortunate if negotiationswfth the French Delegation were opened in Washington beforethe arrival of the British Delegates.The suggestion was then made that there should be drafted, with a view to publication, a despatch from GreatBritain to France, Italy, Belgium and the other Europeandebtors of Great Britain, setting out. the nature of the
demand made by the United States, the seriousness of thectfilt,-i)f- Briti-si1J taxation compared with that of other Fowerseconomic and financial situation in Great Britain,^ and the &apos;necessity, in these circumstances, of Great Britain exaet-ing from her European debtors repayment on the lines ofthe American demand.    The despatch, which would require tobe very carefully worded, would indicate the British viewthat the policy of the United States Government in thematter was a wrong policy, and that, further, it was un-reasonabl^ and inequitable for the United States to attewptto treat separately with her various European debtors.The despatch would also emphasise the fact that,, much as great Britain regretted having to demand payment -from her allies, no other course was open to her, having regard tothe action of her American creditor.   A despatch shouldalso be drafted for transmission to the United States Gov-ernment, which, while fully admitting Great Britain&apos;sliability and acknowledging her intention to fulfil theobligations Into which she had entered, should at the sametime state that Great Britain would not be in a position tomake definite proposals regarding the furd ing of the debtuntil she had completed certain conversations which she wasconducting with her Allies on the kindred subject of theAllied debt to Great Britain.In support of the policy indicated above, the cabinet were reminded that public opinion in Great Britain wouldseverely criticise any proposals which wotild have theeffect of compelling the British taxpayer to satisfy theAmerican debt while at the same time obtaining very little,if any, satisfaction out of the European debtors.    Taxationin Great Britain was about twice &quot;as heavy as in France,and unemployment, which, was most severe here, was practic-ally absent in our debtor countries.   It was most mortifyingfor dreat Britain to have to forego her European debts
and at the same time to be &quot;lectured&quot; by M. Poincara, whohad had the temerity to suggest that our unemployment problem was mainly attributable to a mistaken monetary policy and to the way in which we had handled the questionof the export of raw materials,,After some further discussion, in the course of whichthe view was expressed that public opinion in the UnitedStates of America had had little or no opportunity oflearning the strength of the British case and that it was most important that the United States should realise that by insisting on the payment of debt she would be makingherself in effect the tax-gatherer and rent-collector ofthe civilised world, the Cabinet agreed  To request the Acting Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to arrange for the circulation to the Cabinet of a draft despatch, to be ad-dressed to the Governments of France, Italy,Belgium and other British-debtor countries,referring to the demand made upon Great Britainby the United States Government, recognising the obligation of the British Government in thematter, and stating in full the reasons which made it necessary for Great Britain to take similar measures against her European debtors.The draft despatch should fully set forth theBritish position in this matter, and in parti-cular should emphasize the necessity for simi-lar treatment being accorded by the UnitedStates to all her European debtors:Tnati a aianar ara i u uespa&amp;uji buuuj.u ub px-apsaxtsuand circulated to the Cabinet,addressed to theUnited States Government, acknowledging GreatBritain&apos;s obligations and informing that Gov-ernment that Great Britain was not in a positionto make proposals for the funding of her debtuntil certain conversations with her Allies onthe kindred question of her European debts hadbeen completed:That the draft despatches should be consideredby the Cabinet on a subsequent occasion, andthat, if oosslble, no reference should be madeto the question of Inter-Allied indebtedness inany discussions taking place during the forth-coming visit of M. Poincare&apos; to London.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs warned the Cabinet that, owing to great pressure of business during the forthcoming week, he would not be able to circulate the drafts for some little time.(a)Acting Secr^-1of State forign Affairs(?)
&apos; 99 1JL(7) The Cabinet were informed, in connection with therecent meeting of Bankers in Paris, that Mr Pierpont Morganto germany had expressed the view that an International Loan/would bean entire failure in America unless the American investorcould be completely satisfied that the Entente was securelyestablished, that the interest of the debt would take pre-cedence of any reparation payments, and   this b^ing themost important consideration -- that the obligations ofGermany were finally and definitely fixed.   Mr Morganfully realised that the difficulty of getting any repara-tion settlement was due to the fact that the French couldnot make up their minds whether they wanted a strong Genanywhich could pay reparations, or a weak Germany which wasbankrupt.The Cabinet took note of this communication./

2Trade Boards. 1. With reference to Cabinet 26 (22), Conclusion 3, the HomeAffairs Committee had under consideration a Memorandum by theMinister of Labour (CP. 3990) covering the draft of a trade boards Bill.The Chairman reminded the Committee of the circumstancesunder which the Bill had been prepared, and pointed out that themain issue before the Committee related to the question of graderates dealt with on pp. 5-8 inclusive of the Minister of LaboursMemorandum.The Minister of Labour reminded the Committee that the bill was one which would arouse acute political controversy, and it was inevitable that its introduction would revive considerable criticism,both inside and outside Parliament, of the whole Trade Board policyof the Government.    The original A.ct passed in 1909, while interms applicable to four sweated trades, had in fact empowered theMinister to extend the Trade Boards system to other trades.    The1918 Act had given the Minister much more extensive powers, andunder that Act the Trade board&apos;d procedure  had  been applied totrades the labour in which could not be said to need the protectionof the State in the same way as labour in the sweated tradesundoubtedly needed   that protection.    In  particular, the trade board system had been applied to the distributive trades, and verygreat difficulties had at once arisen.    The agitation  against thewhole Trade Board policy had grown in volume, and at one time it looked as though the whole policy would have to be abandoned.As  this would   have   meant  very unfortunate   consequences, hehad   arranged   for  a   strong   Committee   under   Lord   Cave   to enquire into the whole Trade Board system.   That Committee had now issued a unanimous report, and the provisions of the present bill were, in the main, directed to carrying out the Cave Committee&apos;srecommendations.    With regard to the question of grade rates, itwas true that the Trade Boards had, under the  guise of fixingminimum rates, almost succeeded in fixing standard rates in manycases.  The proposals of the Cave Committee, if adopted, would meet this difficulty, and in future the Trade Boards woiild only be able to fix minimum rates, while rates in excess of the minimum could onlybe fixed as a result of the agreement by a 75 per cent, majority ofeach of the two sides of the Board.   With regard to the expense,the cost of the existing system was about 120,000Z. per annum.Adopting the Cave Committee&apos;s proposals for district Boards, and assuming that there would be no reduction of the present number ofTrade Beards, the cost might rise to 240,000L in the near future,and ultimately to a maximum of 5O0,OO0L per annum.    It seemedout of the question to ask employers to bear this extra cost, and theTrade Unions would certainly not agree to pay for the whole cost ofthe Trade Boards.    There seemed no alternative but for the State toundertake the financial responsibility, every possible effort beingmade to restrict expenditure to a minimum.The Chairman enquired whether it was really necessary tointroduce a Bill of the character indicated during the present session.It seemed to him that any measure on this subject would be open tovery great criticism and misrepresentation by representatives oflabour and of the employers. The Government, by introducing sucha Bill, would incur much gratuitous unpopularity. Unless very strong reasons were adduced, he felt doubtful about proceeding withsuch a Bill at the present time.The Minister of Lab&apos;n,r- in reply, pointed out that unless fresh legislation was obtained, it wculd be most difficult, if not impossible,to continue the administration of the Trade Boards system: Underthe existing law he would be obliged to proceed with cases whichhad been suspended pending the Cave Committee:s Report and itwas very difficult to see how any satisfactory solution of these
outstanding- cases could be reached in the absence of legislation suchas was now proposed.Mr. Wolfe informed the Committee that, in his view, thedifficulties to which tlie Chairman had referred would certainly arise if nothing was done. On the other hand, he doubted whether therewould he very serious objections to the hroad acceptance of therecommendations of the Cave Committee. At present, theadministration of the Trade Board system was most difficult; forexample, the case of the Grocery Trade Board had been hung upfor eighteen months, and if no fresh legislation was obtained, itwould either be necessary for the Minister of Labour to confirm anational rate for this trade, which the Cave Committee had depre-cated, or endeavour to divide the Board into District Boards whichwould be most difficult. Mr. Wolfe also reminded the Committee ofthe delays in bringing into force new and lower rates, and of theneed for setting up district committees so as to enable differentialrates to be paid in different parts of the country.At this point the Secretary of State for the Colonies entered the room and the Chairman briefly informed him of the nature of theprevious discussion.The Secretary of Stale for the Colonies said that, in his opinion,there was much to be said for the original Trade Boards Act of 1909,and for the view that if trades like match making and chain makingcould only be carried on in this country by means of sweated labour,it was better that such trades should not be carried on at all. TheAct of 1909 had, however, been vastly extended and the trade boards system was now being applied, to the.staple trades of thecountry, of which the Dundee jute trade was one. While there was little doubt that this particular industry had been built up on cheapworn an&apos;s labour, it was undoubtedly a most important industry, andthe view taken in Dundee was that its present distressed conditionwas largely attributable to the action of the Trade Board in fixingwages in excess of those which the industry could bear. No doubt the extreme Labour Party would object to any modification of theexisting law, but it was, in Mr. Churchill&apos;s view, essential that verydrastic changes should be brought about. In effect, under em ploy-&apos; ment was every bit as objectionable as sweated labour. TheGovernment would have to decide whether or not a particular tradewas to be allowed to die, and if it decided that the trade should live,it had no right to place such limitations and restrictions upon it as would prevent its being conducted on proper economic lines.The Solicitor-General endorsed the views of the Secretary ofState for the Colonies, and said that public opinion in Liverpool washostile to the extension of the Trade Boards system. He instancedin particular the cases of the grocery and fruit trades.The Minister of Agriculture reminded the Committee that theview was very widely held that the Trade Boards system was responsible for much of the present unemployment.The Minister of Health pointed out that in the events whichhad happened, highly organised trades, such as mining and engineering trades, were subject to great industrial disputes in orderto settle rates of wages, whereas the wholly unorganised trades wereprotected by a State-fixed wage, often much in excess of the wagepayable to comparable employees in the organised trades. Therewas a serious danger that labour in the latter trades would insist onthe State fixing the rates of wages.Mr Wolfe pointed out that the Cave Committee had rejected the theory, which was undoubtedly widely held, that Trade Boardshad caused unemployment. As regards the case of Dundee, thecircumstances were undoubtedly  very tragic, but he could give[8449] b 2
instances of other trades where unemployment was equally severe,and where no Trade Board existed. There were special circura-stances in Dundee which explained the high rate of unemployment.Under the proposed Bill it would be necessary, in effect, to have apublic- enquiry before any trade was brought into the system or was taken out of the system. Such an enquiry would be a greatsafeguard. As regards rates of wages, the jjroposal that in future the Trade Boards should only fix minimum rates, and that anythingabove should only be settled by a 75 per cent, majority, reallyimposed very severe restrictions on the powers of the Boards.With regard to expense, Mr. Wolfe remarked that if no more trade boards were added to the existing list, and if it were decided tobreakup the existing Distributive Trade Boards into District Boards,he estimated that the proposed legislation would not involve an addition of more than 30,000L or 40,000Z. per annum to the vote.The Minister of Agriculture pointed out that, in the case of thesixty-one Agricultural Conciliation Committees, it had been agreedthat the expense should be shared by the two sides.The Minister of Labour pointed out that these committees were voluntary bodies, and did not include members appointed bythe Government. He did not reject the principle of the trade boards bearing the expense.After various members of the Committee had expressed them-selves as strongly opposed to the recent extensions of the trade boards system, the Chairman suggested that there were three questions for the Committee : (l.) Whether it was desirable to introduce legislation during thepresent session;(2.) If the answer was in the affirmative, whether such legislation should be on the lines of the draft Bill, or,(3.) In the alternative, a shorter Bill mainly directed to the exclusion of trades which, for one reason or another,should never have been subjected to the Trade Boardsprocedure.The Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General advised theCommittee that under the existing Act there was no power for theMinister of Labour to take a particular trade out of the systemunless there had been a material change in the conditions since thetime when the particular Trade Board was instituted. In thisconnection a mere change of public opinion was not, of course,sufficient.After some further discussion, the Committee came to thefollowing conclusions: (i.) That in all the circumstances it was desirable to introduce legislation on the Trade Boards system during thecurrent session.(ii.) That the following Sub-Committee should be requested toexamine the question and report to the Committee asto the form which such legislation should take : The Home Secretary (Chairman),The Minister of Health,The Minister of Labour,The Secretary of State for the Colonies,The Secretary for Scotland,The Attorney-General or the Solicitor-General,A Treasury Representative, withMr. Pembroke Wicks as Secretary.
Government ofNorthern Ireland(Loan Guarantee)Bill.2. The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum bythe Financial Secretary to the Treasury (CP. 3995), covering thedraft Government of Northern Ireland (Loan Guarantee) Bill.The Committee were informed that the Bill was required to implement an undertaking given by the Chancellor of the exchequer to the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland to guarantee the principaland interest of loans up to 3,500,0001. to be raised by the NorthernIrish Government for certain public works, unemployment insurance and other purposes.Tb - Committee agreed (1.) To approve the draft Bill.(2.) That, subject to the assent of the Government Whips being obtained, steps should be taken to introduce the draftBill in the House of Commons.Telegraph (Money) 3. The Committee had under consideration the draft TelegraphBill 1922. (Money) Bill, 1922 (CP. 4002), the object of which was to authorisethe Treasury to issue from the Consolidated Fund a sum notexceeding 15,0O0,0O0Z. as may be required by the Postmaster-General for the purpose of developing the telephonic system inGreat Britain and Northern Ireland. The Committee were informedthat the existing financial powers were on the point of exhaustion.The Committee agreed -That, subject to the assent of the Government Whips, steps should be taken to introduce the draft Telegraph (Money)Bill, 1922, in the House of Commons in the form givenin CP. 4002.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,May 29, 1922.
