(1) With reference to Cabinet SI (22), THE PRIME MINISTERread to the Cabinet the letter he had addressed to Mr ArthurGriffith dated June 1, 1922, dealing with the draft IrishConstitution (Paper S.F.B.-62).    THE PRIMS MINISTER explainedthat this letter had been handed to the Irish ministers at about 6 o*clock on the previous evening, with a x5eguostthat they should meet the British Signatories at 6-30.   Theformer complained that this gave them very little time inwhich to consider the document, and it had then been arranged that Mr Collins and Mr Griffith should see the Prime Ministerand that the formal reply of the Irish Ministers should be handed in this afternoon.   In the course of the. interview with the Prime Minister the Irish leaders had raised a numberof difficulties.   Mr Collins alleged that we were taking upthe attitude of Shylocks and demanding the fulfilment ofthe letter of the bond.   He (THE PRIME MINISTER) had pointedout that we had shown our bona fides by withdrawing our troop sand handing over the revenues of Ireland to the Provisional   ,Government.   When asked were they prepared to be includedin the&apos;Empire, or were they still contemplating an independent state, they had replied quite distinctly  - both Mr Griffith,and Mr Collins   that they stood by the Treaty and werewithin the Empire, an admission which didaiot agree with their draft Constitution.   Mr Collins had laid great stress onthe strong feeling prevailing in Ireland against allowingappeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, inview of the fact that three of the Judges were men who had publicly taken up a very hostile attitude to the Irish PreeState, viz., Lord Carson, Lord Sumner and Lord Gave. There wasno doubt that the conduct- of these Judges had placed HisMajestyfs Government in a very awkward and indefensibleposition, and lie (THE PRIME MINISTER) had answered by statingthat where a Judge had taken pe,rt in a controversy he would
stand aside should questions affecting such controversyeome before the Court.   The participation of these judges in political questions was a great misfortune, and its effect would extend beyond Ireland.   Mr Collins hadrepeatedly raised the question of the Ulster situation andof our responsibility for it, in view of the fact that wewere at any rate in part paying the cost of the &quot;Specials&quot;,and pressed for an impartial Enquiry.   He (THE PR1MBMINISTER) had replied that Ulster was a part of the UnitedKingdom and that we had agreed to the employment ofSpecials as substitutes for troops which were not avail-able.   At the close of the interview he had spoken in themost solemn, terms to the Irish leaders, and had striven to impress upon them that they now had the best chance anyleaders ever had of securing real liberty for theiricountry, in association with a partnership of free nations which was filling a great place in the world .   If, through their impatience or folly they threw away an opportunity which had never been given to any of the great Irishmenof the past, such as Grattan or CConnell, their nameswould be execrated for generations to come by their owncountrymen&quot;.   Ireland would never forgive them.   He pointedout that if they failed to stand by the signatures theyhad appended to the Treaty they would be dishonoured, andsuch conduct would be a departure from the high reputationfor good faith which Irish leaders had enjoyed in the past.They had received these observations in silence, but without appearing to resent them.In reply to a question whether the Irish leaders realised that the time had come for them to choose between De valera and the treaty, THE PRIME MINISTER said that he did notthink they quite realised the issue.    Perhaps Mr Griffithdid, but Mr Collins appeared to think that he could carry the others along with him.   He had read to the Irishmen
repeatedly, in the course of the interview, the secondclause of the Treaty, and had impressed upon them that theposition of Ireland in regard to the Crown must he identical with that of Canada.    THE PRIME MINISTER further explainedthat the reply from the Irish Ministers was expected about or 6 o*clock today, and that they would probably make difficulties in regard to the Oath, the appeal to the privy council, and the position of the Republican Members of theforthcoming Coalition Government.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES said we could not possibly give way on the question of requiring the declara-tlon from all the Ministers of the Coalition Government.With regard to the Election itself, it would be better tothe of the elected parliament,wait until we knew Sgft composition^and the method of itselection, before denouncing It.   The more the fear ofrenewed warfare was present to the minds of the electors,the more likely were they to go to the polls and supportthe Treaty.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL stated that he did notmind,the Parliament being a very imperfect-one, but it wouldbe a real tragedy if in days to come Irishmen asserted thatthe Constitution of their country had been adopted by a parliament which did not. truly represent Ireland ,&quot;W SECRETARY OP STATE PGR THE COLONIES said that afterthe June Election it might be necessary to tell the Irishleaders that we could not consider the Election as a sound basis for further legislation by the Imperial Parliament,and that we proposed, therefore, to postpone ratificationuntil their next Parliament, which would be based on adultsuffrage.   That would automatically involve a postponement of the date from which the &quot;Ulster month&quot; would run.THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL pointed out that the objection to the course suggested by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies was that we should be blamed for failing togive notice in advance of this postponement of ratification,having known all the time that the June Election was not abona fide, expression of Irish public opinion.
THE PRIME MINISTER observed that it, would hardly be possible for the Irish people to turn round and blame us for their own cowardice at the polling booth. The situation was not the same as if we had British soldiers in the country and were exercising any pressure for or against the expression of opinion. According to the paet any and every national interest is free to run its own candidates.

MR. CHAMBERLAIN asked what would be the state of Ireland during the period of waiting for the second Parliament and ratification. He did not believe that Parliament or the country would consent to such postponement of the issues at stake unless there was in the meantime very sensible improvement in the situation and adequate protection afforded to the minority.

THE SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR THE COLONIES said that he did not differ from that view.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL, continuing, said that the situation in the South differed from that in the North in so much as the Republicans had refused our offer and that the only people whom the Provisional Government consulted and tried to conciliate were the Republicans. In the meantime murder and looting went on. This could not continue and it ought not to continue. We had done all we could to implement our side of the bargain. It was time the Irish leaders did their share and gave us, and that very soon, a Constitution in conformity with the Treaty.

THE PRIME MINISTER


THE mm?, MINISTER observed that havingt*eg&amp;rd to all the facts there wae little differencebetween the efforta put forward to deal withoutrage between the *3oventente of the north andthe SouthsIn reply to a question ae to the publicationof the Irish Constitution the Prime Minister saidthat the Irish Ministers probably realised thatthe publication      Its original fom would Involvea break with 9t.*   They sight therefore endeavourto escape from their proviso to Do Vhlera to publish.m*omnomuf \tom&amp;% the qneatlon of thepublication of the Constitution ought to be pressed forward now end that we should reelst a freshpact with De valera to postpone the publication and dissuasion of the Constitution until afterthe Elections *    The people of this country would see through such an arrangement.   He had told.*b%Collins In advance of his statecraft to the Houaeof commons what he proposed to tell the llaanm inregard to the Constitution end M^*CollinR hf$agreed*to the line proposed^   In any case whetherthey published the Constitution or not in Irelandthe Important matter wee that we should agree theConstitution with tbesuTHE LORD FfUVY SEAL stated that he concurred in the views of the Secretary of State for theColonies,   The draft Irish Constitution was adirect challenge to us*   ^e had described It as anegation of the Treaty and we could not behave/as if we
as if we were not aware of its existence. We must see that they quickly produce a Constitution in conformity with the Treaty. It was known that at this country, in Belgium and in the United States. Was it right to ignore this peril and allow these preparations indefinitely when we knew that their Constitution was vastly different from what we intended it to be? In his view the issue ought to be brought to a head.

THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the discussion was traversing ground which had been covered at the Cabinet on the previous day.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL laid stress on the importance of the questions put to the Irish leaders being clearly answered and their answers published.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was all for going on with the revision of the Constitution but it would take a considerable time and he doubted if it could be got through before the Election. It had to be borne in mind that the document addressed to the Irish leaders on the previous day altered the whole situation. In the event of unsatisfactory answers there would be a break. On the other hand if the answers ware satisfactory there would be a break with De Valera. He thought the answers ought to be published and that if satisfactory the Lord Chief Justice should be invited to assist in the amendment of the Constitution. He thought there should be
be an agreed eemraunique so that the Xrish peoplet$&amp;0i% know the position before the Election.   Xtwould, he very difficult to put the whole Constitutionbefore the electorate whereas the questions whichwe had put were clear and comprehensible.THE LORD Ql^MIQRLX^R Stated that such a plat-form for the Election would be a most unfortunateone for the supporters of the Treaty in Irelandbecause It would stress the special points in whichwe were interested-and these only.Several Ministers agreed in the view of theLord Chancellor*the mmzym mi rmnxsxcm thought that ifthey accepted our points and were prepared to re-draft their Constitution in the light of them, that should suffice for the present,THE $l*?8$9?AEt OF state FOR THE COLONIES reminded the Cabinet that if their answers were satisfactorythey would be massing no new concession but simplyre-asserting their concurrenoe in the Treaty.    Hethought that in four or five days the Constitutionmight be revised.    A number of amendments had alreadybeen prepared*the cmmmm or the kxgfdbwhr said that the answer to the questions this afternoon ought to showwhether they were going to agree with Pe yalera orgoing to fight him.TRB LORD CHANCELLOR, in reply to criticism,/thought
thought the Irish leaders had known long ago that they would have to break with De Valera and pointed out that the slow but inevitable course of events was at last forcing the issue. He did not think we could decide at the moment the question of publication.

THE  SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES said that it might be necessary to come to some compromise on the question of the appeal to the Privy Council. His Majesty&apos;s Government might conceivably make a public declaration that certain judges had disqualified themselves by political action from hearing Irish appeals. The Irish Free State was entitled to know that the three Lords referred to would have nothing to do with appeals from Ireland. It was a question whether the Tribunal ought not to be purged.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER urged the importance of forcing the Irish Ministers with the straight issue on the Constitutions.

THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND thought that we ought to prepare our own draft amendments and insist on their embodiment in the Irish Constitution.

THE LORD CHANCELLOR said he had glanced at the amendments which had been proposed from our side and thought that these could be modified and that a much more moderate instrument would suffice for our purpose.

/THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.
The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that subjectto securing our essential conditions, it was desirable thatthe Constitution should be drafted in language which would command the widest assent in Ireland.The Minister for Education reminded the Cabinet that theBritish Constitution had a 13th century exterior or facadewith an interior domestic arrangement of a very moderncharacter.    The Irish were interested in the latter and notat all in the faqade.The Secretary of State for the Colonies remarked that theyhad agreed to come behind the facade.The Prime Minister said that it had to be rememberedthat the &quot;Crown&quot; had too often in Ireland representedrepression - the Crown -Forces, the Crown Solicitor, the CrownProsecutor, and so forth.ijriew Lord Balfour stated that in accordance with the desire ofSirCraig. the Cabinet he had that morning had a conversation with sir james Craig and Lord Londonderry.    They had put theirdifficulty as follows.    The whole of the rebellion organisationof the South which had been engaged in resisting the british forces, having nothing further to do in the South had immigratedto the Berth, where they were concentrating all their machinery and were making the utmost trouble.    The Northern Governmenthad to cope with this increased force.   They had to protect a frontier extending 300 miles and. they had not enough soldiersfor the purpose.   They were, therefore, compelled to use thebest members of their special force.
The less excellent parts of the Special force were being used for dealing with the chronic and at the present time- acute disturbances in Belfast.   Insofar as soldiers couldbe provided for guarding of the frontier, it would be by so much the easier for the Northern Parliament to divertthe best of their Specials to Belfast.   In the view of theNorthern Government the present disturbances were beingdeliberately aimed at destroying Ulster   2fc3ra4 they were a part of a great conspiracy for exacerbating the secularfeeling between the Roman Catholics and Protestants, andthese disturbances were being used as propaganda withextraordinary/   skill.   After giving examples, LORD balfour proceeded tosay that additional difficulty had been experienced by theNorthern Government owing to the unfortunate moment chosenfor the disbandment of the R.I.G., who wore now utterlydemoralised, and. consequently one of the best Police Forcesin the world was only partially available.   He had pointediiout to Sir James Craig the extraordinarily difficult situs-tion which would arise if the Treaty broke down, and heemphasized the importance. of the view set forth by thePrime Minister to the Cabinet on the previous day, that inthe event of a break-down we&apos; should have behind us a- unitedcountry at home,supported by the public opinion of theDominions and of the United States of America.&apos; This wouldnot be easy if the South had any ground for contendingthat the Belfast outrages were part of a movement to per-seeute Roman Catholics.    Sir James Craig had called his attention to the fact that the Southern Government hadvoted  100,000 for propaganda, by means of which they werespreading lies all over the world in a very dexterousfashion.   The Northern Government could not afford toundertake similar propaganda.   He himself had pointed outthat this was very dangerous, and the only way he could see

Sir James Craig had called his attention to the fact that the Southern Government hadvoted  100,000 for propaganda, by means of which they werespreading lies all over the world in a very dexterousfashion.   The Northern Government could not afford totmdertake similar propaganda.    He himself had pointed outthat this was very dangerous, and the only way he could see
to meet it was by a British Enquiry into the facts of therecent events in Ulster.   To this Sir James Oraig had stated he had no objection, provided it was initiated fromhadUlster.   LORD BALFOUR/then summed up by stating that he&quot;understood Sir James Oraig would have no objection to an enquiry provided it was the Ulster Government which ap-preached the British Government and said that in view ofthe false reports in regard to what had happened therethey would, be glad if an impartial body could be sent overto investigate and report.   LORD BALFOUR continued that sir James Craig had admitted that the British Governmenthad given them a considerable amount of help, but had sug-gested that Ulster was treated by the Chancellor of theExchequer rather as he treated another Department of theBritish Government, whereas their attitude was that this parliament bad been forced on them, though they did nottheywant it,, by the British Government, and consequently/oughtto be treated generously.     Another point which Sir JamesGraig had made was that it had been very unfortunate thatthe Irish&apos;Regiments had been disbanded at the very moment when trouble was brewing between the North and South.   Hehad said that what South Ireland required was non-eeiamisSanedofficers, and these were available from the disbanded Regi-ments.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he had made a note to raise this point.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES said that thisquestion had been gone into at his meetings on the previous afternoon, and it had been found that the action taken wasunavoidable.    The best plan was to try and. absorb thenon-commissioned officers and men disbanded into otherRegiments.   Many of them, he understood, were willing toadopt this course.   At the present moment a good many of the
disbanded men were on leave in Ireland,THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said he had asked sir james Graig if he expected to reduce Ulster to order, andhe had replied that it was a troublesome matter, but thatin time he had no doubt order would be restored. In replyto the Minister of Education, LORD balfour said that hehad consulted Sir Jareas Oraig about the application of martial law in Ulster.    Sir James Craig had strongly object-ed, on the ground that as a Government they had no right toimpose martial law, and It would involve action by theBritish Parliament.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said, he thought  the feeling of the ulster Government was that it- would be tantamount to adeclaration of bankruptcy in the power of their Government,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES suggested thatthe situation was analogous to the. Central Governmentdeclaring martial law in the event of a Communist risingin some great city.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said there was no analogy in law.THE PRIME MINISTER recalled the precedent of Winnipeg,where a Oonanunist rising had occurred and for the suppression of which the troops not of the State hut of the CentralGovernment had had to be employed..THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL recalled the precedent of the United States of America, where the individual Statesalways resented action by the Federal troops unless theywere placed under the orders of the State.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES thought that ifit was deemed necessary there would be no great difficultyin inducing the Ulster Government to consent to the applica-tion of martial law in Belfast. iTHE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL expressed doubts as towhether the British Government could maintain order any
better than the Ulster Government even If they did declaremartial law.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR stated that that was thegeneral military view.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES pointed out thatthe troops were les3 hated than the Constabulary.   By taking over the protection of the frontier and adopting the mili-tary dispositions which had been prepared for that emergency,a number of good Special Constables now employed on thefrontier would &quot;be released for the preservation of orderin Belfast,THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said the point i7hichhad most impressed him in regard to Sir James Graig&apos;s diffi-cnlties was that the best of the Constables had to be em-ployed on the frontier.THE FIRS&apos;11 COMMISSIONER OP WORKS asked whether Sir james craig would apply for an Enquiry?THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said he had no doubthe could be induced to do so.At this point there was some discussion as to the mostsuit-able individuals to conduct an Enquiry into recent events in Ireland, and as to the Reference for such an enquiry, which, it was generally agreed, would have to bevery carefully drawn.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL thought it wa3 mostimportant that the Reference should be wide enough tocover the oxitrages in the South of Ireland.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said he did not wish to put anyobstacle in the way of an Enquiry, but he expressed eonstd-erable doubts as to its utility.   Events moved so fast inIreland- that before the Enquiry had proceeded far the events would be replaced in the public mind by later happen-ings.
THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the mere fact of thepresence of such a Commission might perhaps check furtherdisturbances .THE MINISTER OP EDUCATION doubted if much was to beexpected from the labours of such a Commission, but at anyrate it would show that the British Government was absolutely impartial.THE LORD PRESIDENT 0)? THE COUNCIL suggested that though no doubt Judges would do the work very well, neverthelesswhat was required was a statesmanlike report on the situa-tion, such as would be rendered by an experienced Statesmanrpip? PRIME MINIS TEE suggested that perhaps the best plan would be to select a Protestant and a Catholic Judge tomake the enquiry.The Cabinet then adjourned this part oftheir discussion, as it was felt that no decision could be taken until the reply of the representatives of the ProvisionalGovernment, was received.(At this point the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff entered.)

In certain even-tualities.She Cabinet agreed t-(a) That no decision was called for at the moment;(b) That the Committees should pursue their inquiries under thegeneral direction   of theSecretary of State for theColonies.
MARTIAL LAW IE 3.     In the course of the discussion on theAREAS AFFECTED BYPOSSIBLE MILITARY subject referred to in the preceding conclusion,MOVEMENTS.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POE WAR raised thequestion as to whether, in the event of adecision to ma&amp;e the military dispositionsoutlined by the Secretary of State for theColonies, the military authroities would be permitted to declare martial law.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL considered that ifit should become necessary to have resort to military movements, the military authorities must be supported by the Government in any steps of the hind indicated by the Secretaryof State for War, which they might deem necessary.lo dec1st on was reached on thispoint *
