German (1)        With reference to Finance Gemmittee 40, Minute 1,Separations .the Cabinet, mh&amp; had been assembled from all parts if great Britain met to consider as a matter ef urgency theposition in regard to Reparations, which had been reached at the Inter-Allied Conference now meeting in London. hey had before them the following documents :-She British Secretary1 s Note of the first two Meetings of the Conference (I.C.P.250and I.C.P.251).She Repsri of a Committee ef Experts appointed- hy the Conference (C*Po4151) *TEE PRIMS MINISTER explained that a very seriousdecision had to he taken.   She four Ministers who had attended the Conference were unanimous as to what thedecision should he.   They had felt, however, that theyhad no right to take up a stand on the subject without having their colleagues behind them.   In spite ef the inconvenience involved therefore, he had felt hound toask Ministers to. interrupt their vacation.     He was sure that all were particularly glad to see the foreign secretary (the Marquess Curssen) who had recently been ill,and whose presence he had felt was especially necessary on an occasion when an important issue ef foreign policy would he raised.She Prime Minister stated that the situation wasbroadly speaking that France took one line and the other allies another.     She Belgian Delegates were anxious to stand in with the French, but their judgment was againstM. Poincare.     Shey were doing their best to persuadeM. poincare to adopt a reasonable attitude, hut when herefused they declined to support him which was veryremarkable in view ef the general attitude ef theBelgian Government.
SS* Poincare&apos;, the Prise Minister continued, had come toX-ondon with a policy which, he said, was unanimouslysupported hy the French Government,   It was an entirely different policy from that adopted hy the French government before the receipt of Lord Baifonr,s Hots of August 1st ontho subject of interallied BeMs. -These original proposals had been for French reparations at the expense of GreatBritain.The Prime Minister then summarised M, poincare*s propos-aXe as followst-(l) To keep on the control over exports whichwas now in the hands&apos;of the Rhine!andCommission, instead of modifying it, as contemplated by the Ambassadors (jonftor-once.1%)   Tim re-estabXisbment of the control over theCustoms Houses on the Eastern fronttor ofthe occupied provinces.The Prime Minister reminded the Cabinet that this pro-pesal involve-1 the- revival of one of the London sanctions,which, however, had been subsequently abandoned,   Under it only paper money had been collected, and in all the Repara-tion Commission had no less than 4,500,000,000 paper Marksin hand, which oould only be marketed, if at all, at- aruinous loss and a certain further enormous depreciation of the Mark. This particular proposal in fact would produceno money of any value outside Germany itself.T&apos;-m SECRETARY OF STATE FOB F0BTXGH AFFAIRS reminded - theCabinet of the everwheXming economic objections to the pro-posal.(3) (a) Germany to be asked to hand over to theAllies certain State properties, includingState mime and, inter,,,a.XMlaJr the mines ofthe Ruhr,   &quot;he state mines, when handedover, could be eeded to a third party, orlet on lease by the Allies.(b) The cession of the State forests, thepre-War revenue from which was ISO million gold Marks a year?   part of the timber from
these forests to he sold abroad and paid forin foreign bills and not in paper Marks.SHE MIfllSTER said that if the Allies took over theState properties in question they would have to work them,and it was quite clear that dorman labour would not work with anything like the &amp;mm seal for the foreigner as fora native owner.   So far frora this proposal producing money,it would probably involve heavy losses, as the cost of con-trol and administration would be very heavy while the output would undoubtedly fall.     Insofar as the produce of themixm$t etc,, was sold inside -Germany, only paper Harkswould be obtained,, while as regards external sales it wouldbe far better to dispose some effective pressure on Germanyto complete the deliveries in kind.   His remarks respecting the mines applied equally to the case of the forests.   !hthis case also there was the added difficulty ef transport-ing the timber.   If the German Government put obstacles inthe way of such transport, the French might press for thecontrol ef the railways to be taken over.(4) 60 per cent, of the capital of certainfactories on the left bank of the Rhine,inoltidi ng dye stuff factories, to be handedover to the Reparation Gomission.THF mim MIMISTEH remanded that similar objectionsapplied to this proposal,   There would be the same diffi-enlties with labour, and the return (if any) would be in paper Marks,(e) Collection of taxes in tho occupiedregions.Here, again, the difficulty was that any return wouldbe in a currency valueless from the Allied point of view.
(6) An effective control ef the German(histome by the Cosnmiitt.ee of Ou&amp;ran-tees.   The product of the Custeissand an agreed percentage of the exports to be paid to the Hepara-tion Commission in gold or inforeign bills.fgfi nmm MXRX82BR pointed out that the only part of&apos;this proposal which was of value was the percentage of the credits arising out of the exports *        This, however,had been agreed to in London and had been, and was still,in operation.   Great Britain-could readily assent to itsbei fig e continued*The Prime Minister, continuing, said that U* l^oincarehad received practically no support f-r his proposals ttemthe other Allies, but it had been agreed that the proposals should be referred to a Committee of Experts under theOhaimanfifiiip of the Chancellor of the Kxchequer, who shouldbe invited to examine the practicability and productivity of the proposals.   The Committee of Experts had reported,,and he would now ask the Chancellor of the exchequer to inform, the Cabinet as to the position,
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that speaking generally M.Poincare obtained no support in the Committee of Experts for his proposals except to a limited extent from the Belgian Delegates on the proposal for the control of the Ruhr mines. There was another proposed put up to the Committee of Experts but not contained in M. Poincare&apos;s document, namely, a proposition to surround the Ruhr Valley with a set of Custom Houses and impose duties on all experts from and imports into the Ruhr. The British Delegates pointed out, and all the Allies except the French had agreed, that this preposition was merely a method of harrassing and embarrassing the Germans, and that to grant a moratorium was inconsistent with proposals of this kind which would prevent any revival of Germany.

In the result the Committee of Experts had rejected both the plan for a line of Custom Houses on the east bank of the Rhine and a line of Custom Houses surrounding the Ruhr Valley.

The Committee of Experts had then considered the question of the occupation of State mines. As originally proposed by M. Poincare this plan involved the assumption by the Allies of the ownership of the mines with the consequential right of leasing or selling them in the last resort. The French Delegate on the Committee had, however, represented that the French Government only contemplated supervision and not ownership. It was not proposed in fact that if there were losses on the mines the Allies should bear the losses, and he had eventually agreed that the proposal would produce no more coal and no more cash than the present regime. In fact he admitted that the proposal was in the nature of a sanction.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he had opposed the French point of view, had urged that it was impossible under the Poincare plan to compel the despatch of larger....

  
larger quantities &amp;f coal than under the present arrangementsrn.it that the hast remedy would he te sei?s the esspert     &apos;v &apos;credits and so put prensure upon the Gearmaa Government tocarry out the coal deliveries *   This point of view had beenaccepted by all the Allies with the exception of the Premohami Belgians *    As regards the state forests the Belgianexperts., had deserted their freach acllcagu.es and had agreedthat withcut wersan goodwill there wag no effective methodof getting the timber to a market whore it could be sold forcurrency &amp;t a value for reparations *    fhe Committee had agreed te refer to the Separation Commission the questionof examining the best method of securing that Germanycarried out her obligation to make deliveries of timber in kind *of the capital of the factories en the left bank of theRhino the French hole gate had said that the 60 per cent would produce- 600 million gold marks and that pending thefcasdiiag ever of this sum the Allies should he entitled toreceive two-thirds of the actual profits of the businesses *fhe Delegates, ether than the Prenoh Delegates * had unanimously agreed, however, that this proposal could net fee adoptedwithout very heavy sdmlaistr ative oesi, and that as regardsthe taking over of the capital this would have to be aecoss-plisked., either by sequestration of a kind similar to thatpractised by the Soviet Government, or, if the shareholderswore to be paid out in paper marks, the printing of thosemarks would lead to a further heavy depreciation of the mark.With regard to the German customs duties, it waspointed out that under the arrangements already made theCommitteeAs regards the proposal to take over 60 per cent
Committee of Guarantees had very extensive rights and thatit was unnecessary te incur the expense and trouble incidental to actual Allied administratisn of the Custcms.   Shis view had prevailed in the Committee,the French Delegate dissenting,THE PRIME MINIS SEE remarked that M* Poincare had saidthat if he had to return to Prance with his proposals rejected the French Government had decided to take action en their own account,   She British Ministers had then pointed cut the veryserious nature ef this statement, which, if carried cut, meant a breach ef the Entente and of the Sreaty,   Shey had pressed the view that the proper body to consider the question of themoratorium and the guarantees, if any, to be exacted was theReparation Commission.   Shis divergence ef view had produced a very serious crisis and it was clear that if M. Poincarereturned to France and took the action which he threatened totake, it would be useless for the Allies to point cut thatthis involved the breaking up of Germany, as M. Poincare would merely retort &quot;So much the better;   if France cannot getreparation at least let us have security&quot;*-7-\
THE FKIMS MXSXSTEB, oontinuing, said that, in hisopening statement, M.poincare&apos; had hinted that his proposals were an ultimatum and that he oould not accept any compromise.After the translation of his speech ho had, however, correctedthis remarksaying that he had he en ivrongly translated and that what he had, in fact, said was that the general principle must be accepted and there should he no moratorium without guarantees.Subsequently, however, in conversations with the Prime Minister,J .PoinoarC had insisted on the whole of his propositions.M.Poincars&apos; had not been in the least affected by a very powerfulappeal made to him by the Prime Minister of Belgium.   In theresult it had been agreed by the British and Belgian Delegatesthat the British proposals should he reduced to writing andthis had now been done.(A copy of the proposals in the foam circulated to theCabinet at the meeting is attached, see Append la:).-&quot;THE LOBS PRIVJ? SEAL said that before the proposals were considered, ho would like to remind the Cabinet that all were agreed that Germany should pay up to the maximum limit ofher capacity sad that there should he a moratorium for someperiod.     The question at issue was the length of the moratoriumperiod and on what conditions, if any, the moratorium should hegranted.   Tho British view was that the conditions should bethat Germany must put her house in order with a view to payingas much as she could.   Groat Britain and Belgium, with somewhatlukewarm support from Italy, accepted the proposition that themost that any country can pay in satisfaction of a foreign debtis the difference between tho value of the exports and thevalue of the imports of the country reduced to the absoluteminimum.      Anything taken in exoeos of this minimum difference is in the nature of an instrument of punishment, the use ofwhieh will dislocate national economia life, hut will produoeno gold.
THB mim MIlJlSfBR then read the British proposalsana made brief explanatory comments upon them.   He drewparticular attention to the concluding paragraph of theproposals, stating that it was important from K*Poine8rd,spoint of view that the amount of the annual payments to he made by Germany for the periods after the 31st December nestshould be fixed later in the year after the Reparation commission had had an opportunity of consulting with the Bankers1 Committee.These payments could fee fixed with reference to the amountof the loan which the Bankers might advise could he floated ontheir security.He added that S.Schanser . approvea the documentgenerally, but would prefer to omit those portions of the concluding paragraph dealing with the fixation of the annualreparation payments after the 31st Pecember.THE CHAHCSLLOB OP THB mCHEQEER informed the Cabinetthat MM.fhemiis and Jaspar had agreed with the document asa whole, but would like its language strengthened as they considered that, as drafted, it would be regarded by publicopinion in Prance and in Belgium as too conciliatory toGermany.   Shore would be no difficulty in meeting this criticism.   M.Sheunis had emphasised the very difficult situation in which he and the Belgian Government were placed at the moment.   She French-Belgian Press was stronglysupporting the attitude of the French Government and was verycritical of the Belgian Ministry,   fhe Flemings who normallywere not pro-French were genuinely alarmed because they feared that in the event of an isolated French advance into Germanythey were in danger of being surrounded.     Shey were accordingly pressing the Belgian Go\-ermaent te side with france.   M.fheunis had stated that if France took Independent
action the Belgian Government would certainly have to acqnieseand condone such action.     She judgment of himself and hiscolleagues was against the French point of view, but his political position was most difficult and the feeling against Germany in belgium was still intense.    On these grounds ho was most anxiousto reach some modus Vivendi.THE SECRETABY W STATE FOB FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thathe addressed the Cabinet with some diffidence as, owing to hisillness and absence from London, he had not had an opportunity ofobtaining a firsthand knowledge of the facts.     He agreed entirely with the criticism which had been levelled fey the  rime Ministeragainst the six proposals of M.Poinoar$, hut the Cabinet must remember that the question was a very much larger one than that of disagreement on these particular proposals.   The issue before theCabinet was one of the whole political futureof Europe and of a rupture with franco.   As he understood the position the british proposals were intended to form a bridge over which MoPoincare&quot;could retire without loss, of prestige.   At the moment no doubt the. Belgians and Italians sided with Great Britain.   The real question was what action should he tateea in tho not-impose ibisevent of M.Boinoare&apos; holding out for his own proposition.   WouldGreat Britain in this event be justified in breaking with. France?The question must be looked at from the point of view of theEuropean political situation.   He had been much struck by the remarks made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer respecting theposition in Belgium.   His (Lord Cursors) information confirmedeverything that had been said on the subject.   It must beremembered that if Great Britain broke with France, the probabilitywas that Belgium In the end would follow the French lead.   Belgiumwas terrified.of France and it might almost be said that Prancedictated Belgian policy.     Tho same applied to Italy.   Ho doubtrecently there had been strained relations between France and Italy,but France was in a position to put very great pressure upon theItalians and it was unlikely that any Italian Ministry could long
survive the hind of pressure which France was in a position to$exercise.As regards the conduct of M.Pcincard and tha French Governmenthe held, as was well known, very strong views,   in this connection he (Lord Curson) reminded the Cabinet of the highly unsatisfactorycharacter of the recant proceedings of the French Government relative to the Pear Eastern negotiations.   &amp;e was also anxious respecting the attitude of the Little Entente.   France was in a position toexercise terrifying influence upon the individual States forming the little Entente and she was, in fast, threatening to become themilitary dictator of the Continent.   With regard to the United Statesof America, Great Britain was making every effort to overcome thevarious difficulties.     She Balfour Mote.and the coming Mission to washington were evidences of otar good faith.     She relations betweenthe United States and France had been much shaken in consequence ofthe latter&quot;&amp; attitude at the Washington Conference.   Shore was some reason to believe that they had recently improved and his(Lord Curzon,s) idea was that if Great Britain broke with France on this Question American opinion would not necessarily takeGreat Britain&quot;e side.   As regards the Foreign Office view, itmust ho remembered that if Great Britain broke with France weshould have to contemplate a hostile France over the whole of theSear   set and in Egypt, in Morocco and in Sangier.   Becent events in Sunis where France was ill-treating British subjects was an example of what would happen elsex5/here.   Bp to the present timeFrance, though nominally friendly, had indulged in anti-Britishactivities in various parts of.the world.   If there was a rupture.Great Britain would have to face a France bitterly and openlyhostile in every part of the world.   She history of the early yearsof the present century indicated the difficulties &quot;which would arise out of such a situation.     She Chancellor of the exchequer had said that M.Poincard may not he in a position to accept these or some other proposals.   He (Lord Curaon) was glad to hear that there might be alternative proposals.   He would ask his colleagues tostrain every nerve to preserve the Entente, the rupture of whichwould be fraught with the meet serious consequences for all concerned
fm mtm UlMBTm said that ha agreed that every efforteh.ould.he to do to prevent a rupture, hut at the same time he did not wholly share the views of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs respecting the impotence of Great BritainvlSrr&amp;yjsdJL an enraged poincare.   Tb.mr&amp; was no doubt that italy and the United States were both strongly opposed tothe whole attitude of M, Polneare and his friends.   He hadbeen assured that this was the ease with, the Americans,not only by Sir Auckland G-Mdes but also - by 4Sr S&amp;fb and theF&amp;itor of Brjhe Philadelphia Ledger&quot; and other importantAmerican eitisene.   Th&amp; United states regarded France asImperialistic, militaristic and aggressive, and if france were to march into the Ruhr he had no doubt whatever thatthe sentiment of the United States would be behind GreatBritain*   In this Batter both, the great American political parties were in favour of peace, and our proposed action would, put the United States more on our side than -anything else we had ever done,   M regards the Little Entente he waacertain that they did not favour a poincare policy.   at genoa the representatives of the Little Entente had refusedto follow. France,- and at The Hague they had signed a memorialurging that the Great Powers should keep the peace ef Furope. Jsey certainly had no sympathies for a Chauvinistic France.As regards Belgium, IS,. &quot;Pheunis * s supporters were mainly pro-French, but it must be remembered that they did not form amajority of the Belgian Parliament,   ?be Flemings and theSocialists were all anti-^French,He agreed that Great Britain should make every possibleeffort to come to terms wit&apos;-- M* poincare, and if the Chan-cellor of the Fxeftequer had other proposals &quot;of a reasonable and valuable character he would be all in favour of examiningthem?   but he waa convinced that any policy involving the handing over of Furepe to the tender me roles of M,Poinoareand the French militarists would be directly contrary to the
traditional policy of Great Britain and would be fatal tothe reconstruction of T^europe and highly dangerous to theBritish &quot;spire*   In his view there was evidence to indicatethat Prance was endeavouring- to re-establish that supremacyin Europe Which she bad exercised frets time to time inhistory *   If IS* Poincare wore now to deliver an ultimatum to Great Britain and British Ministers were to accept it,the only interpretation to be placed upon their action wouldbe that Great Britain had yielded tip the control of vuroponot to Prance, but to M, poincare and his Chauvinistic friends.He (the p*ive Minister) was absolutely against any suchpolicy, which, he was convinced, would not be tolerated bythe industrial population of -Great Britain-or by the repre-eentatlvea of finance and industry in this country.   Theworking man was definitely opposed to reparations,- and theonly people here who supported the French point of view were those who had never ceased to fight against Germany since the &apos;Armistice.   Z  the British Government were nowyte accept M,Poimare*i propositions, or anything resembling them, In afew months&apos; time,when their futility had been demonstrated^nothing but die grace and discredit would accrue to the percent-ernment.   In this matter the Government should do what theyhonestly believed to be right, and, so far as he was concern-ed, he was entirely opposed to any policy of hauling downour flag because of the threatened military resources ofFrance, bached by the politics of the Qua! df Orsay,the smnwpAm op state fop mnmm affairs said that hehad not argued In favour of ffi. Poinesre^s proposals.   all he had impressed upon the Cabinet was the absolute necessityof striving to avoid a rupture.   He did not doubt that theItalian- and Belgian Ministers were, at the moment, favour^able to Great Britain&apos;s point of view, hut he was of opinionthat as time went on the pressure of events would force both those countries to follow the lead of France,
3333 LGEb CHABOSLLOE said  that he would like to say a few words on the subject of the British proposals.     In his viewthese proposals, modi fled perhaps in forsi but not in substance,ought certainly to be laid before the French.   M.3?oineare&apos; wasadopting the same attitude now as he adopted at Genoa, when itmast be remembered he took up a very intransigeant line directlyafter his defeat of M.Brianfl.      If he, the  herd Chancellor,had thought that Prenoh policy in this matter wan dictated by financial, or economic, or, using the word in Its highest sease9political, considerations, he would have thought the french proposals worthy of the fullest investigation, but he was quite clear in his own mind that &amp;hey had to deal with the questionof Party Politics.   There were only, he thought, two alternatives;one was to send the British proposals to the French and the secondto give way and accept M^Poinoare1s proposals.   If Great britain was to give way we must accept some of the responsibility forall the consequences of imposing M.poincare** s proposals, and hewould much rather that the whole responsibility should fall ontrench shoulders, than that the proposals should be put intooperation with the implied, or actual acquiessnoe of Great Britain.THE MIHI3EJSK OF HE Ah SB enquired whether it would not bepossible to make some British proposals based on the cancellation of Inter-Allied debt, and hs suggested, that the French should be offered a moratorium in respect of the interest on the French debtfor five years.TEE CHAHOEHLOK OF TEE S&amp;GBBGffSB said that he had hadsomething of this kind in mind, but it must be remembered thatit was important to avoid giving the impression that M.PoincarS*had achieved great success from his London visit.THE PHIMK MIMSTEB thought that there might be agreat change in French public opinion if Medicare&quot; put his proposals into effect, occupied the Ruhr at great expense andproduced nothing for the French Exchequer except quantities of
 valueless paper.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that it appeared to him that the question was whether, if Great Britain found it impossible to compromise with M. Poincare on the lines of the British proposals, we ought to give way. The latter policy involved seizure of private property, collection of taxes and the cessation of all reparation payments, and the destruction of Germany&apos;s economic life. Public opinion in Great Britain would be horrified and the Government would be held to blame for all the detrimental consequences of French action.

Some discussion took place as to procedure to be adopted regarding the British proposals. General agreement was expressed with the view that the best course to adopt woule be for the Prime Minister, accompanied by M. Theunis, to submit proposals informally to M. Poincare, before their consideration at a formal meeting of the Conference.

The Cabinet, while anxious to do everything possible to preserve agreement among the Allies, agreed:-

(1) That it would not accept the proposals of M. Poincare.

(2) To approve the general tener of the draft British proposals subject to certain drafting alterations.

(3) That in the event of final disagreement with France, the Prime Minister and his colleagues should offer to refer the questions at issue for settlement to the Reparation Commission or the League of Nations.

(4) That the draft British proposals should be revised by a Drafting Committee composed of the Prime Minister, the Lord Privy Seal, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for War, and that, after revision, they should be communicated to M. Poincare by the Prime Minister who should be accompanied if possible by M. Theunis.

(5) That the members of the Cabinet should remain in London for the present so as to be available in the event of a further meeting being necessary.

The- obligations imposed upon Germany by theSchedule of payments of 9th May 1921 have not been fulfilled.The cash payments due under that Schedule were only effected in full during 1921 and the German Government has nowexpressed its inability to continue the reduced cashpayments fixed for 1922.     The deliveries of coal and of timber required by the Allied Governments and ordered by theReparation Commission have not been effected.
