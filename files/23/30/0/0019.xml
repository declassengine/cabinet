3 3 2THE LEAGUE (l-) With reference to Cabinet 62 (21), Conclusion 6,Of&quot; NATIONS.-- the Prims Minister raised, as a matter of urgency in viewRepresenta-tion of the   of questions to be asked the same day in Parliament, theBritish Gov-ernment at     subject of who should represent the British Government atthe Assembly.the forthcoming meeting of the Assembly of the League ofNations in September at Geneva.The Lord President of the Council expressed thehope that, in view of the many and varied calls upon him for official work, it would not be essential for him to be present throughout the whole of the session of the Assembly.The main issue was as, to whether, in addition toGovernment representatives, there should be representa-tives, or substitute representatives, of public opinion,as suggested by the League of Nations Union (Paper CP.-4057) .Strong arguments were adduced in favour of repre-sentation of the British Government by official representsatives as at the meeting of the Assembly in 1921.   TheCabinet were reminded that the British Government had onlyone vote in the Assembly, which was given by the Head ofthe Delegation.   The latter would necessarily be a government representative, and, if a non-official representative wereto adopt a different line from the Government on a Oommis-sion, he might have to be thrown over by the Head of the delegation in the Assembly, which would create an awkwardsituation.While there was general agreement that some Govern-ment representative must be included in the British Delega-tion, it was suggested that the question   of whether thereshould also be non-official representation or substituterepresentatives raised issues on the general attitude of theGovernment towards the League of Nations which requiredcareful consideration.
The 0shinst agreed -That the question of the representationof the British Government at the forth-coming meeting of the Assembly of theLeague of Nations should he discussed at an early meeting of the Cabinet.-2-
TRkW. POLICY.       (S).fhe Cabinet had a preliminary die ones ion on thepresent position and future outlook of British trade. after a general survey of the question by the Prime Minister, inwhich he referred to the demoralisation attendant upon theunempl o y men tlong continuance of the receipt of/doles, the. President ofthe Board of Trade reviewed the position and prospects ofthe chief industries of the country, in regard to which hewas able to report a slow improvement.   On the whole, the forecast which he had given the Cabinet in a previous Paper(0 .P.-3890) had been confirmed.   Wages and railway rates had fallen, and there were signs that prices were now becomingstabilised.   It was remarkable that, despite the Engineeringdispute, the upward tendency of trade had been maintained.rtrhe chief exceptions were the coal trade and shipbuilding,in both of which there was a great deal of short time.   Onthe whole, relations between capital and labour were betterthan they were five or six months ago *   He saw no reason to doubt his former forecast, that the improvement, though slowwould continue, but normal conditions&apos;could not be expectedfor. a year or two.The Minister of Health (Chairman of the UnemploymentCommittee) and the Minister of Labour then made statements in regard to the position and prospects from the point ofvie&apos;- of unemployment and emigration.   They laid specialstress on the existence in the country of several hundred thousand young men under thirty years of age who had receiv-ed no industrial training, owing to the - War, and whom it was desirable to encourage to emigrate to the Dominions, wherethey should be trained for agricultural pursuits and settledon the land.    The Minister of Labour estimated that therewould be l:r millions unemployed in the forthcoming winter,and as this would be the third hard winter and all Trade
Union funds wore exhausted, the position was one which called!fox&quot; the most energetic study, which the Unemployment Oossnit-tee of the -Cabinet &apos;bad already commenced^The Secretary of State for the Colonies stated thatthe Dominions were quite willing to join in a big emigrationscheme, provided suitable men were sent out.   He referredalso to certain railway and other public works which it mightbe possible to stimulate in the Grown Colonies,The Secretary of State for India alluded to thepossibility of further orders for railway material from india.After considerable discussion of a preliminary character, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That a Cabinet Committee should be set upto examine the question of British. Tradein all its bearings:(b) That the Prime Minister, after further&apos; &apos;     consultation with the Lord Privy Seal,should submit the names at an early meeting of the 0 abine t.(.MQT13.    The Secretary of State for theColonies particularly asked that,in view of the large amount ofwork he is Already undertakingfor the Cabinet, he might not becalled on to take an active partin the work of the new Committee,and suggested that Mr Amery, theParliamentary under-Secretary tothe Admiralty, who had devotedspecial attention to the questionof emigration, should serve inhis place on the Committee.)(e) That the Ministers at the head of the Depart-raents concerned should give immediate ins true-tions to their respective Departments to pre-pare Memorandafor the use of the Committee:e.g*, by the Board of Trade on the situation as a whole, and embracing suggestions deal-Ing with Europe, India and the Colonies;    bythe Ministry of Labour on the relation of,trade and unemployment:   by the ColonialOffice on emigrationjandby the Colonial Officeand India Office on the possibility of securingand financing orders for the devel opment ofthe Dominions, Colonies andlndia, so that theymay be in a position to take full advantage ofthe eventual recovery of trade:
(&amp;) That the statisticians of the Ministry ofLabour and the Board of Trade should con-cert with a viavr to the presentation of comparable figures in regard to the courseof tmemployHjent and the export trade inthe years immediately pzeceding and follow-ing the War.-5-

SPECIAL POLICE     (3) With reference to Cabinet 58 (22). Appendix I (Con-PROTECTION. *elusion 5 (a) ), the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bytho Secretary of State for TTome Affairs on the subject ofSpecial Police Protection (Paper 0 .P.-4108) .The Secretary of State for Home Affairs gave theCabinet a list of Members of Parliament in both Houses whowere supposed to be in some peril.   In this connection tiewas particularly requested by the Chief Secretary for Irelandnot ,-to overlook the case of General Prescott-Decie, who, asa leading representative of the Southern Unionists in Ire-land, might be specially liable to attack.The view was expressed that General Presoott-Decieought only to be afforded protection in London^ a**3 -only...00kng aO&quot;bo refroinod frosr making provoc&amp;tiv a ape&amp;ehaa-.The Cabinet agreed  To approve generally the policy proposedby the Secretary of State for Home affairs in his Memorandum, namely, not to give special protection in any more eases unless.there was reasonable evidence that the- person in question was in danger.
IBELAKD.oCompensationfor Injuries.IBELAHB.The Constab-ulary inH. Ireland.(6)    With reference to Cabinet 32 (22) Conclusion 1,  theCabinet were informed of the arrangement concluded betweenthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and Sir James Craig by-which the -British Government would pay up to  3,D00,000for the upkeep of the Constables in lorthern Ireland duringthe present financial year on the understanding that ifthe British Government thought the need for the Constableswas reduced or that they were being over-paid, they mightwithdraw or reduce their contribution after giving notice.It was proposed that a Commission appointed by the(4)    With reference to Cabinet 2^ (22) Conclusion H,the Cabinet took note of a draft letter to the ProvisionalG-overnment dealing with compensation for maliciousto property to Irelandinjuries/oii-eulated by the Secretary of State for theColonies.    (0.P.4120)I EEL All Do (5) With reference to Cabinet 30 (22) Conclusion 3,WinterAccommodation   the Cabinet had before them a memorandxmi by the Secretaryfor Troopsin Ireland.       of State for War on the provision of winter huttingfor the troops (a) in Northern Ireland, (h) in Dublin,during the forthcoming winter.     (CP.4119)It was explained that so far as could at present before seen it would be necessary to maintain a force of 16battalions in northern Ireland during the coming winter and 6 battalions in Dublin.    The cost of the provisionof hutting was estimated at just under  250,000.In reply to a question the Secretary of State for Warstated that he could not pledge himself at this early stage to obtain the proposed expenditure out of Army votes,but he would do so if at all possible.The Cabinet agreed to authorise theprovision of i^inter hutting for thetroojjs in northern Ireland and inDublina
British Government should, be sent to northern Ireland inorder to inspect the organisation of the Constabulary witha view to advising whether any, and if so, what, action was necessary to reduce expenditure-Is the course of the discussion attention was called to the criticism of the &quot;Specials&quot; which widely prevailedand to their alleged participation in a recent outrageagainst Catholics at Gushendall.    It was pointed out onthe other hand that Sir James Craig was convinced thatthe Specials had been largely responsible for preventingattacks on Catholics and for the comparative quiet which followed the assassination of Sir Henry Wilson and theCelebrations on July 12th.The Cabinet agreed to take note of the ar-rangement concluded between the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Prime Minister ofNorthern Ireland.(7)    She Cabinet agreed -To refer to the Provisional Government ofIreland Committee the question of providing an escort for the Viceroy in connection.  with the visit which he proposes shortly to make to Ireland.
RAH CHARGES (8) With reference to Cabinet 40 (22), Conclusion 3ITALQiTY) BILL .(d) (1) , the Cabinet further considered the draft of a Billto make valid certain charges imposed and fievies made duringthe late War (Paper 0 .P.-4110) .The Cabinet were reminded of the previous discussionof this subject by the Cabinet and at the Home Affairs Com-mittee.   It was now raised at the instance of the Ministerof Agriculture, who had been unable to be present at the last meeting of the Cabinet,   The Cabinet were informed that in19SO a Parliamentary Question had been put by Sir GilbertWills to the Pood Controller on the subject, particularly from the standpoint of the South Western Counties.    In his reply the Pood Controller had stated that the sum of  852,000was involved and that,as1 a test case was pending, no part ofthe money was being expended.   From this reply it had beeninferred that, should the test ease go against the Government,the money involved would be returned to the farmers.   If this were not done there would be a great political agitation inthe farming constituencies of the South West.- The Solicitor-General stated that, apart from anyquestion of pledge Which might or might not be inferred fromthe reply of the Food Controller, and apart from the politicalaspect of the question, the view of the Law Officers was thatit was logically easier to defend the principle of the draftBill if it were made to apply all round.    The House of Lords *decision in the case of milk was just as applicable to someof the other commodities, and he could see no way, in princi-ple, of drawing a line at milk.After some discussion on the possibility of diserim-inating between milk and other goods, the cabinet agreed -and (b) ,(a) To rescind their previous conclusion:/thatmilk should be excluded from the operationof the War Charges (Validity) Bill.

Dear Sir Robert Horne

Overseas Trade (Amendment) Bill

This is to remind you of the conclusions reached by the Cabinet this morning on the above subject, which were to the following effect:-

(a) Not to proceed with the Overseas Trade (amendment) Bill;

The result would be to extend the present Session for the greater part of the week beyond the date now proposed for adjournment. It was suggested that the matter could possibly be dealt with under the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill, and this it was decided to do if it was French in enquiry to be ?.
