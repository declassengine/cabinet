Gladstonewere mentioned) the satae charges as are being made todayhave been brought against successive Governments-The Cabinet were told that there was a generalunderstand ins; among most of those who had instigated thepresent agitation that if, in addition to the usual enspir-ies, any enquiry v?as agreed to, it should be confined tothe future.,The Government Whips advised the Cabinet that apoint-blank refusal of any enquiry would result in a very bad Division in the fTcuse of Commons.A suggestion was made that the Prime Minister might make a reasoned speech,, refusing to agree to a Committee,,but stating that in future he intended to set up some special machinery for investigating each ease, before submitting the list to His Majesty.   The n-ovsrnsssnt Whips advised that,even so, a bad Division was to he anticipated.While general dislike to the proposed Committee was expressed, several members of the Cabinet felt that, in thepresent state of Parliamentary feeling, there was no alter-natlve but to agree to it.In the course of a very full disensoion it transpired that opinion on the subject was almost equally divided forand against the appointment of a Committee to examine future procedure.The lord President of the Council pointed out thatinasmuch as the Debate would not take place until Monday next, and that in the meantime the  rims Minister,
lord B&amp;balfour, the Xiord Chancellor and lord Crawford wereto moot a Deputation from the House of lords, and thatthere would he other and later opportunities of Judgingthe probable attitude of members, it wa9 not desirable totake a binding decision that day.

Trade Boards. 1. WITH reference to H.A.C. 1.13th Conclusions, Minute 1, theHome Affairs Committee had under consideration the Conclusions(T.B.C. 1st Conclusions) of the Sub-Committee appointed to examinethe form which legislation on the Trade Board system during thecurrent session should take, and also a Memorandum by the Ministerof Labour (CP. 4061) covering the draft of a Statement of the- (3-overament&apos;s policy, which it was proposed to issue as a command paper pending the introduction of legislation.The Attorney-General stated that, while he approved generally the terms of the draft Statement, he had the following two criticismsto offer upon it: In the first place, he reminded the Committee that at themeeting on the 29th May, 19i!2, the opinion had been expressed by various members of the Committee, and particularly by the Secretaryof State for the Colonies, that the time had come to relieve importanttrades from the jurisdiction of the Trade Board system. It did notappear to him that this point of view was adequately emphasised inthe draft Statement, and he felt that if the Governments policyaimed at a substantial limitation of the present Trade Board system,public opinion would be critical if this policy was not definitelyenunciated in the Command Paper. He suggested that his point would be met by the insertion after the word &quot; concerned &quot; in line 8of page 1 of the Statement of the following sentence &quot; in the directionof securing greater elasticity.&quot;In the second place, he thought that, as it stood, the wording of 3 (a), at the top of page 6 of the Statement, Was open to misinter-pretation, and that it was most desirable to emphasise the fact that itWould be the dxity of a Trade Board to fix general minimum timerates only in the case of those trades to which specific reference ismade in paragraphs 53 and 54 of the Cave Committee&apos;s Report.He suggested that 3 &apos;a) on page 6 should end as follows : &quot;in thetrades to which the above observations of the Cave Committee are applicable.&quot;The Minister of Labour pointed out that the proposed State-ment was designed to show the extent to which it would be possibleto carry out the recommendations of the Cave Committee by. administrative action, and also to indicate the character of the&apos; legislation which would be required, before the Cave Committee&apos;sproposals could be fully adopted. It would, in his view, be most unwise for the Statement to lay undue emphasis on the proposedlimitations of the Trade Board system. To do so would provoke inany case a controversy, and give rise to the suggestion that theGovernment intended to repeal the whole of the anti-sweatinglegislation. He personally would have no objection to incorporatingin the Statement words to the effect that the Government were ingeneral agreement with the Cave Committee&apos;s recommendations, buthe was quite ready to accept the words suggested by the Attorney-General.With regard to the second point raised by the Attorney-General,the Minister of Labour pointed out that 3 (a) on page 6 of theStatement was a quotation from the Cave Committee&apos;s Report, andhe suggested that the point would be met by inserting the words&quot; of the Cave Committee &quot; after the word &quot; recommendations &quot; inthe penultimate line of page 5. Having regard to the very important political aspects of the question, he suggested that beforethe Statement was published it should be formally approved by theCabinet.The Committee agreed (1.) To approve the suggested statement in the form appended to C.P. 4061, subject to the following amendments : 
Page I, line 8 : The insertion of the words &quot; in thedirection of securing greater elasticity &quot; after the word&quot; concerned.&quot;Page 5 : The insertion of the words &quot; of the CaveCommittee &quot; after the word &quot; recommendations&quot; in thepenultimat-3 line.(2.) To recommend that- the Cabinet should approve thepublication as a Command Paper of the amendedstatement, as an indication of the manner in which theGovernment proposed to carry into effect the recom-mendations of the Cave Committee respecting trade board policy.2. With reference to H.A.C. 115, Conclusion 4, the Committeehad before them a Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture,covering a draft Rabbits Bill (CP. 4035).It was explained to the Committee that the object of the bill was to enable Local Authorities to take steps to destroy rabbitswhich were causing damage on agricultural land. The Bill followed the lines of section 10 of &quot; The Corn Production Act, 1917,&quot;which had been repealed last year, except that administration wasentrusted to the County Councils instead of to the Minister. Sincethe repeal of the Corn Production Act there had been greatagitation amongst farmers for the re-enaction of the section relatingto rabbits, and the Council of Agriculture for England had twicepassed resolutions in favour of the introduction of a Bill.At present there was a plague of rabbits for two reasons :Firstly, the splitting up of large estates amongst small owners who did not possess gamekeepers ; and, secondly, the recent dry seasonswhich had favoured the breeding of rabbits. The present Bill wouldre-enact verbatim the section of &quot;The Corn Production Act, 1917,&quot;which had been repealed. Not much opposition was expected, andthe agricultural community generally would welcome the Bill.There was one small point unsettled, and that was, who shouldtake the profits, if any, arising out of the sale of the rabbits ?Under &quot; The Corn Production Act, 1917,&quot; the profits, if any, didnot go to the occupier, although the occupier had to bear the loss,if there was one. It was not expected that any profit would, infact, accrue, because the extermination of rabbits was best carriedout during the breeding season, but it was now considered thatthere was no objection to the occupier taking any such profits as might accrue.Some objection was raised to the Bill on the ground that it waslegislation of a character which was properly enacted during thewar on grounds of public; benefit, but which should not be continued in normal times. It was urged that if legislation of this characterwere really necessary for exceptional and temporary reasons, a time limit to the operation of the proposed measure should be fixed sothat it should not remain permanently on the Statute Book.Further, it was stated that the Board of Agriculture for Scotland,though agreeing with the principle, wished the Committee to considerwhether it was desirable to confide these powers to County Councils.The experience of the Scottish Department had been that powers soconfided worked badly, and it was suggested for consideration thatthe powers under this Bill should be confided either;to the Ministryof Agriculture or to the Agricultural Committees.   -In reply, it was stated that the English Ministry possessed nofunds for this purpose and did not desire to operate the powers inquestion, whilst the Agricultural Committees were Committees ofCounty Councils, and would be the bodies to which the CountyCouncils would naturally confide the operation of these powers.There were technical objections, however, to naming the agricultural committees in the Bill.[8582]
It was pointed, out that the Bill had not been submitted in draftform to Parliamentary counsel, and it was stated that this had notbeen considered necessary as the Bill merely re-enacted verbatim therelative provisions of &quot; The Corn Production Act, 1917.&quot;After some discussion the Committee agreed (1.) That the Legal Adviser to the Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries should consult with Parliamentary Counsel asto the form of the Bill;(2.) That the operation of the Bill should be limited to fiveyears;(3.) That the Bill should be approved for introduction, theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries stating that he didnot desire to press for further stages of the Bill to betaken at the moment.(4.) That the Bill should not as introduced provide for the occupier taking any profits which might accrue from theextermination of rabbits, such a provision being held in reserve as a concession to be made, if necessary, duringParliamentary discussion of the Bill.Measuring 3. The Committee had before them a Memorandum (CP. 4018)Instruments Bill. by the President of the Board of Trade covering a draft Bill relatingto measuring instruments. In view of the absence of the Presidentof the Board of Trade the Committee agreed To postpone consideration of the Bill until their next meeting.Bailway and canal commission(Consents) Bill.4. The Committee had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War regarding the occupation of land&apos;;covering a draft Railway and Canal Commission (Consents) Bill(CP. 4036). The Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Acts,1916 and 1920, had given Government Departments certain post-warpowers over lands occupied originally purely for war purposes, butthey had made the exercise of some of those powers subject to theconsent of the Railway and Canal Commission being signified withincertain periods. The number of applications to the Commissioner waslarge and it was not expected that the Commission would be able to dispose of all of them before the expiration of the specified periods.The object of the Bill was, therefore, to provide for those cases inwhich application had been made to the Commission within a prescribed period, but which the Commission were unable to dispose of before the expiration of such period. The Bill contained threeprovisions :  (1.) Clause 1 (1) relating to the power of keeping closed publichighways over lands to be occupied temporarily oracquired permanently under the Acts. The Commission^consent would, under existing legislation, have to besignified before the 31st August next. Clause 1 (1) ofthe Bill would give power, provided any application hadbeen lodged with the Commission before the 31st Augustnext, to keep the highway closed whilst the commission were dealing with such application.(2.) Clause 1 (2) similarly would entitle the Department toremain in temporary occupation of land until its application had been disposed of. Under presentlegislation applications for continued temporary occupa-tion must be filed before the 28th February, 1923, and consent must be given before the 31st August, 1923.(3.) Clause 1 (3) relates to cases in which the consent of theCommission is necessary to the compulsory purchase ofland under the Acts.   Under present legislation the
consent of the Commission to the purchase must begiven by the 31st August, 1924, but this clause providesthat if an application is lodged before that date and theconsent of the Commission is subsequently granted the purchasing Department may effect the purchase within such time as the Commission may allow.The view was expressed that the Bill would, in effect, relieve the Commission of any obligation to close its proceedings within alimited time, and might result in the public being kept indefinitelyout of its rights. Tt was suggested that it would be desirable to insert in the Bill a time limit on the deliberations of the commission under each section, and that this time limit should be announced during the second reading.It was further suggested that the Bill should give power tomake application to the Commission to prevent the indefinitecontinuation, e.g., of the closure of public highways. This wouldbe a normal power to- give, and would help the passage of the Bill.As regards Clause 1 (3), it was pointed out that when thelegislation relating to compulsory purchase was enacted, an under-taking had been practically given as to the limit of time duringwhich Departments would have power to acquire land. StrongParliamentary opposition might be expected to legislation whichextended the time during which Departments might acquire land.Provision should be made in this instance also for power of application to the Commission.It was also suggested that provision should be made, in theevent of appeals by Departments from decisions of the Commission,for power to enable the Commission, where they refuse their consent, to stay execution pending an appeal from the Commission^decision.At this point the Under-Secretary of State for War joined theCommittee, and the above criticisms of the Bill were summarisedfor his information.After some further discussion the Committee agreed : (I.) That the Lands Department of the War Office should consult with the Railway and Canal Commission on thequestion whether it would be possible to introduceamendments into the Bill providing for the following : (a.) A definite limit of time for the deliberations ofthe Commission under each sub-section ofthe Bill.(6.) A power of application to the Commissionrequesting that any particular case may bedealt with at once in view of hardship.(c.) A power enabling the Commission to grant astay of execution from its decisions, pendingappeal.(2.) That the result of the consultation between the two departments should be reported to the Attorney-General.(3.) That the Bill should then be referred once more to theCommittee.5. The Home Affairs Committee had under consideration aMemorandum by the Home Secretary (CP.-3991) on the questionof the exclusion from this country of former enemy aliens. TheCommittee were reminded that section 10 (1) of &quot;The AliensRestriction (Amendment) Act, 1919,&quot; would lapse in december next. This section provided that no former enemy alien shall, fora period of three years after the passing of the Act, be permitted
6to land in the United Kingdom, either from the sea or from theair, or, if he should land without permission, remain in the UnitedKingdom without the permission of the Secretary of State, which isonly to be granted on special grounds and for limited periods.The Committee were informed that the question was an urgentone, inasmuch as the Crown Colonies and Protectorates desired toknow what attitude the British Government proposed to take on thesubject. It should be remembered that, apart from section 10 (1),there were sufficient powers in the Secretary of State to control the entry of former enemy aliens into this country.The Minister of Labour thought that the whole question of the .law respecting the admission of aliens required investigation, and,in particular, drew attention to the fact that the Ministry of Labourcontained a branch which was concerned with the question of the admission of aliens who cculd satisfy the authorities that they haddefinite employment in prospect.The Committee agreed (1.) To approve the proposal of the Home Secretary that section 10 (1) of the Aliens Restriction (Amendment)Act shotdd be allowed to lapse automatically.(2.) To request the Home Secretary to confer with the Secretaryof State for the Colonies as to the best method of dealingwith colonial requests for guidance, having regard to theabove decision.(3.) That the Home Secretary and the Minister of Labour should discuss the particular question of the future arrange-ments for the admission of aliens.(4.) That the attention of the Board of Trade should be speciallydrawn to the concluding paragraph of the HomeSecretary&apos;s Memorandum (CP. 3991) relative to section 11 of the Act of 1919, which prohibited theacquisition by former enemy aliens of any land in the&apos;United Kingdom or any interest in a key industry.Legitimation Bill. 6. With reference to H.A.C., 110th Conclusions, Minute 1, theHome Affairs Committee had under consideration a Memorandum(CP. 4011) by the Home Secretary, covering the draft of a Bill toprovide for the legitimation of illegitimate persons by the subsequentmarriage of their parents. The Home Secretary said that he wishedto draw special attention to two points. In the first place, inaccordance with the proAnsional decision of the Committee, the bill had been drafted so as to provide only for the legitimation of cases in which the persons were free to marry on the date of the birth ofthe child. In this way the law of England would be brought intostrict harmony with the law of Scotland. He, however, felt verygreat difficulty in defending this limitation, which, in his view,would be strenuously opposed by those interested in the promotion of the Bill, who would represent that the limitation in effect would seriously minimise the scope of the proposed reform. The second point to which he desired to draw attention related to a proposal tomake the provisions of the Bill retrospective. The practicaldifficulties in the way of this proposal were well-nigh insuperable.The- Minister of Agriculture pointed out that, while theproposed limitation would no doubt result in certain hard cases, yet the opposition to the Bill would be greatly strengthened in variousquarters if it was proposed to extend the law of England beyond
ths law in Scotland in the manner indicated by the Home Secretary.There were very serious objections of a practical as well as a senti-mental nature to legitimating children born at a time when their parents were not free to marry, and he trusted that the Bill wouldbe introduced in its original form.The Secretary for Scotland said that he agreed with the Ministerof Agriculture, though for somewhat different reasons. If proviso (a)of sub-clause (1) of Clause 1 were omitted, then the legitimacy of a child would depend on the highly technical question of re-domicileof the parent. A child, for example, might be born and resident inEngland, but if the father were domiciled in Scotland the childwould be legitimate under English but illegitimate under theScottish law. Corresponding anomalies with regard to real estatewould also arise. It would be most undesirable to create substantialdifferences between the law in the two countries, and in particular it would be a retrograde step to accentuate existing domicile problems.There was no doubt whatever that the Scottish members would strongly oppose the omission of the proviso, and their opposition,and the opposition which they would attract, would add subsequently to the difficulty of passing the Bill into law.The Attorney-General informed the Committee that he was not himself much in favour of the Bill, and he foresaw very greatdifficulty in passing it into law even if the proviso were inserted.The best recommendation for the Bill was that it brought theEnglish and Scottish law on the subject into harmony, and that inScotland no great difficulties had been experienced in administering the existing law. No doubt the more logical view was thatenunciated by the Home Secretary, but in a matter of this kindsentiment had to be considered, and he felt sure that it would be impracticable to pass the Bill into law without the proviso.The Chairman reminded the Committee that the Bill was primarily introduced in the interests of the children, and particularlyin the interests of the children of the poor. Social workers were strongly in favour of the measure, which would do something to relieve the pitiable situation of the illegitimate child of poor parents.The effect of the proviso will be to restrict the scope of the Bill,inasmuch as the majority of persons concerned were not, in fact,free to marry at the time of the birth of the child.Having regard to the differences of opinion disclosed in thecourse of the discussion, the Committee agreed To refer to the Cabinet for decision the question whether thedraft proviso (a) to sub-clause (1) of Clause 1 of the Bill,which limits legitimation to cases in which the parentswere free to marry at the time of the child&apos;s birth shouldbe retained or not.Increase of Kent, 7. With reference to H.A.C. 105, Conclusion 2, the Committee&amp;c. (Restrictions), had before them a Memorandum (CP. 4067) by the Secretary forAct- Scotland regarding the Increase of Rent, &amp;c.  (Restrictions) Act.From this Memorandum it appeared that since the discussion at theCommittee on the 23rd February the position in Scotland, whichwas not then acute, had materially changed as the result of adecision by the First Division of the Court of Session that a notice to quit is necessary in order to enable the house-owner to exact the increases of rent permitted under the statute.The Secretary for Scotland had that day received representa-tions to the effect that, in view of this decision, increases of rent
2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,June 28, 1922.owhich had obtained during a series of years were now invalid. Thedecision complicated not only the relations between landlord and tenant, but also the whole machinery of rating and valuation. Thequestion was one of the greatest urgency.The Committee, agreed That the Minister of Health should, in consultation with theSecretary for Scotland, circulate to the Committee at theearliest possible date a Bill dealing with the question.
