(a) That of tho seven Draft Resolutions inquestion, those numbered. (I), (V), (VI)and (VII) were acceptable, but that (II),(ill) and (XV) were highly controversial. \y.The Cabinet agreedTo refer the Draft Resolutions in cabinet paper G.P.-4059 for consideration, in thelight of the Cabinet discussion, to thefollowing Committee, with a request thatthe Coyffi-i.ittee should report to the Cabinetthereon at the Meeting to be held onFriday, July 7, 1922:-The lord Ghaneellor (in the Chair),The Secretary of State for the Colonies,The President of the Board of Education,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for India,The First Commissioner of Works^Mr R.B.Howorth (Secretary) ,HQ.TB;-   In view of the absence of the Lord Privy-Seal and the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, the Prime Ministerauthorised the Secretary to send toHis Majesty the King and also to thoLord Privy Seal and the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, copies of a detailed note of the discussion, with a request in each case that the copiesmight be destroyed after perusal.
fojAlIGIAL (5) With reference to Cabinet 4 (22), Conclusion 2,feDXTIOHf AUSTRIA a     the Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs statedthat he had been delayed in coming to the Cabinet Meetingby a Conference he had held with the Chancellor of theExchequer and officials of the Treasury and Foreign Office(including Mr G.M, Young^ the Controller of Expenditureout of the British Government Loan to Austria), on thesxib^ect of the present financial and economic situation of Austria, which was said to be in a practically hopelesscondition.   The British Government was the only source fromwhich financial assistance could come, and it was in thehighest degree improbable that the British Government wouldconsent to lend or give the large sums required, even if itwere in a position to do so.   In the opinion of the governor of the Bank of England, a financial collapse in Austriawould not have very grave effects in this country, inasmuch as the possibility of sueli a collapse had been alreadylargely discounted.    On the other hand, a similar catastrophein Germany would have very serious reactions here.The Cabinet were in general agreement that no useful purpose would be served by advancing further financialassistance to the Austrian Government merely with a viewto postponing what appeared to be an inevitable financialcatastrophe.
IB situation IRELAND.(Use of Gasjrenades byMe FreeItate Gov-[ernment.(6) With reference to Cabinet 36 (32), Conclusion 1,the Cabinet were informed that the Irish Free State government-rnent had intimated that if they could be supplied withsome form of gas grenades their task in clearing the rebels out of their strongholds would be greatly simpli-fied.   Ammunition of the description required was avail-able in the hands of the Disposals Board.The view was expressed that, having regard to theWashington Convention on the subject of poison gas,, itwould be improper for the British Government to sxipply theFree State Government of Ireland with gas of a lethal orpermanently injurious character, but that, provided theWashington Resolution did not tie our hands, the sameobjections would not apply to grenades containing 3a ehryma-tory or other similar gas.The Cabinet agreed  fliat if, after examination, it appeared that the terms of the Washington iiesolu-tion did not forbid the use of lachrymatoryand other similar gas, steps might be takento supply ammunition containing such gasto the Irish Free State Government for use against the rebels....L Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,July 4, 1932.
