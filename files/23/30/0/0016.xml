(HE ANGLO- (3) With reference to Cabinet 36 (28), Conclusion 4,pEBT * the Cabinet had a further discussion in regard to theAnglo-American debt, and had the advantage of the presenceof the British Ambassador at Washington&apos;The Eight Hon. Sir* Auckland Geddes).The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,the Prime Minister, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer,informed their colleagues of the following developments which had occurred since the question was last discussed at the Cabinet:-(l) The French Government had sent a delegate to Washington to discuss this question, who was onthe high seas.   He had, however, no authority to conclude any agreement, and his duties wotil^d belimited to stating the economic reasons which made it impossible for Prance to pay her debts .(2) A communication had been made to the ActingSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, from an un-official but important source, to the following effect:&quot;If a security for loans from private personswereissusd at two per cent, interest on longterm obligations to be met at par, it isthought that in the united states and possibly - though this my informant could not speak of in the same way -- in this country also,a large number of persons would invest money in this form in order to secure capital for themselves and for their descendants. the attraction would be freedom from Income tax and freedom from Death Duties.The money so raised would be applied for easingthe international financial situation.   It.wouldbe to the advantage of Continental nations topurchase these applications and pay off theirindebtedness with them.   Whether it was contem-plated that further arrangements might be intro-reproduced to ease the general situation was a topicon which my informant did not enter.&quot;(s) The Prime Minister and some of his colleagues had had an informal conversation with the american ambassador (Mr Harvey) and Mr Taft, in the course ofwhieh Mr Harvey had asked why the British Government
were not sending over a delegation in response to theAmerican imitation to arrange for the funding of ourdebt.   Mr Harvey had felt that the attitude of theAmerican Administration on this subject had been mis-understood.   What the Administration wanted to do wasto make common action possible on the part of theUnited States and the British Empire by clearing the debt between them out of the wayt and thus enabling them to stand together as the only creditor Powers inthe world in dealing with the rest.   This was theessential basis of Anglo-American co-operation indealing with the problems of Europe.   The Administra-tion were tied hand and foot in the matter until theBritish debt to America was cleared out of the way.Mien that was done, however, co-operation would be easy, and, he thought, fruitful.   Mr Harvey could not understand why we had allowed the French to send a delegation while we had done nothing.   This would be.misunderstood in the United States.   It would be thoughtthat we had deliberately refused an invitation from theAdministration to come over ahead of other &quot;Europeanpeoples to discuss the question.   Mr Harvey had been most emphatic in repeating that this -would be a disastrous-troiis blunder.As regards tha funding of the debt, Mr Harvey hadbeen understood to maintain that when once the debt wasfunded at, embassy, 4% per cent,, the backing of theBritish and American Governments would make it thefinest security in the world, and would result in so great an appreciation that the real interest charge upon this counts^ would fall to anything from 2 to 2^per cent.    He had also maintained that the British and
American Governments could do as they pleased inputting the bonds upon the market, and could evenmake arrangements for postponing this operation, ifnecessary, to a later date.Mr Taft had given his opinion that the CongressionalElection in November would probably result In a severeweakening of the F;epublioan Party, even if a Democraticmajority were not actually elected.   He had furthergiven the Prime Minister to understand that the Administra-tion would have a special opportunity of dealing with dif-difficult questions in the three months&apos; session left tothe old Congress before the beginning of March, whenit would cease to exist.
The British Ambassador at Washington (SirAuckland Geddes) then gave the Cabinet an appreciation of the present position of this question in the UnitedStates of America.     About ten days ago he had had a confidential discussion with Mr. Hughes, the American secretary of State, who had expressed the personal view that it was altogether against the interests ofthe United States that the debt owing by Great Britainand the other Allies should be repaid.     Mr. Hughes&apos;general views were shared by Mr. ItellfiT, the Secretaryof the United States Treasury.     Both these gentlemenwere of opinion that if the matter \?as discreetlyhandled American public opinion would eventually comeround to the view that it was a mistake to insist on re-payment.     At the moment, however, that public opinionregarded the debt as money actually lent by america to other countries on a commercial basis.     Certainbank and manufacturing interests were carrying on an active propaganda, particularly among farmers, in favourof the policy of concession, and if time were giventhis campaign would undoubtedly bear fruit.     At themoment, however, it was out of the question for anyAmerican Administration to come forward with theproposals for cancelling the debt or any substantial part of it and no American Senate would entertain anysuch proposals.Mr. Hughes had expressed the hope that GreatBritain would enter into discussions with the AmericanGovernment on the question of the funding of the debt and it was his intention to make Great Britain the offer of the best possible terms he was empo^Yered to make and he very much trusted that Great Britain would find it possible to accept these terms.    It was proposed/ to give
the same terms to all the American debtor countries andif the United States Government subsequently find themselves in a position to accord more favourable terms to some other country than they had agreed to giveGreat Britain, Great Britain would be granted thebenefit of the more favourable terms.     The american administration fully realised that France was in noposition to pay, nevertheless they took the view thatif a settlement could be effected with Great Britainthe whole atmosphere in America would undergo a changefor the better.     Popular attention would be diverted to other topics and the propaganda by the bankers and manufacturers would gain headway until ultimately, in mr. Hughes&apos; opinion, American public opinion wouldbecome reconciled to the idea of the cancellation ofthe debt.The scheme to which reference is made in (2) onpage  3     above was an entirely unofficial scheme basedon the idea that after a settlement had been effectedas regards funding operations, the new bonds would beheld by the United States Treasury and that Great 33ritainwould proceed to float a loan at 3/* interest guaranteed by the British and American Governments, the proceeds of which would be used to pay off the new bonds.    Itshould be observed that while under this method GreatBritain would reduce her indebtedness to America roughlyby one-third, yet as the remainder of the debt wouldbe in the hands of private persons, all hope of ultimate cancellation would disappear.     On this, andother grounds, Mr. Hughes was not disposed to favour the scheme.Sir Auckland Geddes informed the Cabinet that onthe whole he was disposed to favour the following line/of policy
(of policy :-(l)     To reply to the United States ambassador in London that the British Delegateswould be in Washington by a certain date j which need not be before september, for the discussion of thefunding of the debt and that in themeantime the British Government wouldmake arrangements without prejudicefor the payment of interest.(2)     That in the discussions at Washingtonthe British Delegation should endeavour to obtain the best termspossible from, the AmericanGovernment and in particular %srmake acceptance of these termsconditional on Great Britainbeing accorded &quot;most favoured Hat ion&quot;terms in the matter of inter -allied,indebtedness and that the Treatydealing with the question should contain a provision that in theevent of any substantial changebeing made in the financial policyof the United States, such forexample as a new tariff or ashipping subsidy. Great britain should have the right to re-open the settlement.That a despatch should be sent to the debtor Allies on the general linesof the despatch drafted by the acting Secretary of State forForeign Affairs (a copy of thd draft despatch in the form considered bythe Cabinet is appended^but writtenso as not to offend in any way thesusceptibilities of the american people.    In particular the despatchshould avoid any suggestion that america was treating Great Britainbadly in the matter of debt and to let the facts in this respect speakfor themselves.       The despatchshould include an invitation to theAllied Debtor Countries to attend aConference in London to discuss withthe British Government the questioncf the cancellation of the debt owingto Great Britain in excess of GreatBritain&apos;s debt to the United States andthe fpnding of residuary Allied indebted-ness to Great Britain.In the course of subsequent discussion doubts were expressed whether the proposals adumbrated byMr. Hughes really constituted tfery favourable terms forGreat Britain.      It was pointed out that if once the/debtm    Q    mm
debt was iUMed and interest payments were beingregularly made, it would be most unlikely that anyAmerican Government would incur the odium of imposingthe increased taxation which would he involved by acancellation of the debt.     It was also pointed outthat if America was unwilling to make concessions toGreat Britain at the present time when Great britain was in a somewhat critical financial position, she wouldbe very unlikely to make any concessions in the futurewhen the financial position of this country mighthave recovered.     As regards &quot;most favoured Sation&quot;treatment, it was improbable that the United States wouldinterpret this treatment to mean that if Prance and Italyfailed to pay their obiigations, as they were certain&apos; todo, Great Britain would not be under any obligation to fulfil her obii       ons although she might be able todo so.On the other hand the advantages of making an amicable settlement with the United States Government wereemphasised.     The proposal that the debt should beretained by that Government ac a national obligationand she-aid not be marketed was in itself a valuableconcession and it must be remembered that if Americansentiment was alienated it was open to the AmericanGovernment to insist on our debt being funded on abasis over a period of 2? years,     It was very important to secure relief if possible from theseonerous conditions.     In this connection Sir auckland geddes stated his opinion that the time would in all probability come when America would be prepared to cancelpart if not the whole of her debt.   A great change was/noticeable
noticeable in American public opinion, largely due tothe influence of the women1s vote said recent electioncontests had resulted in the return of persons holdingliberal views on the question.     Unless the AmericanGovernment were prepared to give Great Britain &quot;most favoured nation&quot; treatment and to meet her in other respects, he, personally, would not advise the BritishGovernment to enter into any binding settlement.The Cabinet agree d:-(a) That the Acting Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs should informthe United States Ambassador inLondon that a British Belegationwould be in Washington in the first week in September nest to discuss with the American Authorities thequestion of the funding of the debtsfb)    That the Acting Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, the Chancellorof the Exchequer and Sir auckland geddes should examine the draft despatch to the Allied debtor countriesin the light of the Cabinet discussion,and while keeping- to the general schemeand tone of the draft should have discretion to soften any passages whichmight be thought to reflect directly onthe attitude of the American people.(e)    That the draft despatch should contain a hint that the Allied Debtor coxxntriesshould meet the British Government in conference for the purpose of discussing the question of the cancellation andfunding of Allied debts to Great Britain.(d)    That the Acting Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should take steps tosend the draft despatch when approved tothe Allied debtor countries and furnish a copy of it to the United States Government.

PKBB5PLGYMENT        (4) with reference to Cabinet 20 (22), Conclusion 1,BENEFIT .the Cabinet bad before them a Memorandum by the Ministerof Labour dealing with proposals to reduce the intervalsbetween periods of unemployment benefit during 1932(Paper C.P.-4084).The Memorandum explained that, as a result of aDeputation representing Poor Law Authorities which waitedon the Prime Minister on June 20th, there had been aConference between the Chancellor- of the Exchequer, theMinister of Health, the Secretary for Scotland and theMinister of Labour at which various devices for relieving the pressure on the Guardians had been examined.   It hadbeen agreed to prepare a Bill providing for a reduction inthe present intervals from five weeks to one week.   Underthis proposal the additional benefit payable was estimated to cost  2,750,000.   The Treasury would bear abo\it one-fourth of this sum (with interest) as a final charge.In the course of the discussion it was suggestedthat the reduction of the intervals should be from five weeks to two weeks, but it was pointed out that thiswould not secure the object aimed at, vis*, to preventnumbers of unemployed being thrown for short periods onto Poor law relief.   It was most desirable to preventthese fluctuations.The Cabinet agreed  -To approve the proposals of the Ministerof Labour for reducing the intervals fromfive weeks to one -week, and to authorisethe introduction of the necessary Billto amend the Unemployment Insurance Act,1922,

At first the House,had pressed for an immediate discussion.    The Lord privy seal had pointed out the difficulties of a discussionbefore all the&apos; facts were available, and the House had accepted his proposal to have-a.discussion : on Mondayinstead of the discussion &quot;of Irish affairs which had previously been arranged,The Lord. Privy. Seal-&apos;had under-,-taken to put down the Irish Vote, or&apos;whatever Vote seemedmost suitable, and if the Chairman was unable to.---permit-
?S 9w u (.j; tho Debate to cover all the ground desired by the House,,he had agreed that the Government would move the adjourn-ment.Questions bad been, ashed as to why the Police were notarmed, and whether they would be armed in the futture;The Home Secretary had -informed the House that the Policedid not care to be armed, but they were permitted to beararms if they wished, and the Lord -Privy Seal had undertaker!that the question of arming the Police should be re-examined.Questions had also been asked as to whether the weaponsused for the murder of the Field Marshal had been weaponshanded over to the Provisional Government, to which no reply had been given.   Various suggestions had been made that warnings had been given to Scotland Yard by Membersof Parliament and others and had not been acted on, as tothe danger to Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson and others.Certain.particulars had been communicated privately toMr Chamberlain afterwards, which are dealt with in a &apos;separate Conclusion.    The general trend of the discussionindicated that the criticism in the forthcoming debate would bo directed mainly in regard to the degree of pro-tec ti oh provided in the past and to be &apos;provided in thefuture.ANGFMF3JTS (4) Some discussion took place as to the arrangementsJEE hEPATF&amp;pIpAY?       to he made for stating the Government case in the debate on Monday.      (All officials, except the Secretary, withctoowduring the discussions on this subject.)    Towards the endof the meeting the Lord Privy Seal received a transcriptof the Questions and Answers in the House, which he handed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.
The Conference agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should be the first speakerfbr the Government:(b) That he should not confine his statement to this particular outrage, but should review the situation as a whole, aecentu-atihg the importance of the recent voteby the Irish people in favour, of the Treaty;setting forth how much the British Govcrn-jnent had done to enable tho Northern. Govern-ment to protect itself;    describing the representations made to the ProvisionalGovernment, either by reading the prime minister tor? s letter to Mr Collins (sec.Conference of Ministers of June ggnd)  orotherwise;    and generally emphasicingthat the root of the trouble was the irish republican Army, and that now the Provision-al Government has received its vote ofConfidence from the Irish people the BritishGovernment is entitled to insist that theambiguous position of the I.R.A. must cometo an end&apos;;(c) That at an early stage of his speech theSecretary of State for the Colonies should include a&apos; statement on the question of theprotection now being offered:(d) That Colonel Childs should communicate to .the Secretary of State for the Colonies full information in regard to the information atScotland Yard of threats, warnings and.  prbtaction generally (Sec Conclusion 7 below) .(5) (The officials of the Home Office and the police force were present during this part of the discussion.)THE LOPp PRIVY SEAL stated that after Questions inColonel- Archer-SheeParliament he had asked / to come to his roomColonel Archer-bheeinvthe House of Commons . / had given him variousInstances of warnings alleged to - have been given-to scotland yard as to the danger-to certain persons.    In particular,it was alleged that *. Major. Arbuthnot had received informa-tion and had notified Scotland Yard that on June 14th alarge gang of gunmen had come over to this country viaPishguard, and that Colonel Sanderson had either forwardedor brought to Scotland Yard a typewritten warning some three weeks ago indicating the existence of special danger to Fi^ld Marshal Sir Henry Wilson, Colonel Gretton, LordParnham and ColoneL Archer-She e.
&apos; 284Colonel Carter--was., asked to enquire at ScotlandY^rd whether this information had been received.Later in the meeting COLONEL CARTER returned and stated that he had not been able to discover the type-written document referred to, although it was possibleit might still be found.   He&apos; thought it not improbable,however, that the document might have been, destroyedafter being incorporated&apos; with, other similar information in the records of the Department.    This course waS oftentaken for the.safety of &quot;persons who gave information.He read a document, dated Jfiar-eh SSh&amp;, indicating theintention of the Irish extremists to &quot;do for&quot; Judge Wilsonand Sir Henry Wilson.    The enquiries were still being pursued. ...COLONEL CHILDS was very sceptical about the informs-tion supposed to have been given by Lag or     Arbuthnot,when: he knew intimately.    He recalled an incident threeweeks before, when information had been received to theeffect that certain Cabinet Ministers were threatened, andhe had taken immediate steps for-their protection.    Thedifficulty, however, was that no information was everreceived from Ireland as to when Irish gunmen were comingover to this country.    One statement which had been broughtto the attention of Scotland Yard-, -    to the effect that agreat number of Irish gunmen were coming over, had beentraced to some remarks made by an R.I.C. man who was drunkat the time.   Another difficulty was that Scotland Yardhad very little knowledge of what parsons in Ireland were sufficiently important  to be protected when on a visit tothis country..The Conference were informed teat some time ago the Ulster Government had been ashed to furnish informationas to what Ulstermsn should be protected when visiting thiscountry,  and persons who were notified by them were in fact
&quot;put under protection&apos; when in Great ThrLtain..   &quot;That vjBorninga letter had been received by Scotland Yard&apos; from Mr LionelCurtis undertaking to give information when persons from ireland of sufficient importance to be protected were to visit this country.COLONEL CHILDS informed the Conference that some  .time ago he had received from Field Marshal Sir henry wilson a number of threatening postcards which had beensent to him.    On investigation these had been proved toemanate from a person of weak intellect in the suburbswho was in the habit of sending such missives to leadingpublic men.    Wo subsequent notification had been receivedfrom Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson.The Conference agreed  as(a) That Scotland Yard should keep in/close touch as possible with the Ulster&apos; Govern-raent- in order to ensure that protection wasgiven to persons visiting this country fromUlster who were deemed to be likely to be threatened:(b) That Colonel Childs should communicate thefacts in regard to such warnings .(6) In connection with tho subject referred to in theprevious Gonelxision, some discussion took place as to the expediency of establishing a passpo;et system between Ire-land and the British Isles.   The view met with considerable support that some system of passports ought, in presentcircumstances, to be provided.The Conference were reminded, however,  of the essen-tial difference between the establishment of a passportsystem between Ireland end Get;at Britain and between theContinent and the United Kingdom.    In the latter case thoforeign Governments were concerned to assist as much aspossible.    The Irish Government, on the other hand, wouldnot have the seme interest.    To make it effective it wouldbe necessary that the passports system in Southern Ireland
should he in the hands of the military authorities.There was the further difficulty of Ulster.GENERAL- H0RW00D, on the basis of great experienceduring the War, express.3d his opinion that the passportsystem across the land frontier could not be made effec-tive.    This would therefore involve passports betweenUlster and Great Britain,   Moreover, the passport system with the Continent had only been made effective by reduction--ing the passenger traffic to a more trickle.The Conference were reminded that in the present case one of the accused was a Government servant and hadlived in London for years.   There was some evidence thatthe other man was also a Londoner.    If both were Londoners,therefore, no passport    system would have availed.(7) The Conference were informed that the measux^esbfprotection initiated during the acute stages of the Irishcrisis had been brought to an end shortly after January13th.   Subject to a few -Exceptions, protection had then been withdrawn from Cabinet Ministers and from certain other persons who had \ip to then been protected.    In thecase ef Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson, protection hadbeen given so long as he was Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff, and a letter from the War Office to Scotland Yardwas read to the Conference thanking them for the steps taken and asking that in the case of necessity the sameprotection might be given to Lord Cavan, the new Chiefof the Imperial General Staff.At the present moment, in accordance with the decisiortaken at the Conference of Ministers on the previous&apos; day,.,,protection was being given to all Cabinet- Ministers, aswell as to Lord Carson and Captain Charles Craig..After some discussion,, the Conference agreed  (a) That protection should, in addition, bearranged for -the following:-
The Viceroy, ;Colonel Arclior-Sh.ee, M0Pv,Lord Farnham,CoLonel Grotton, M.P..,Mr Ronald Me Noil 1, M.P*(h) That protection should he given&apos;toGeneral Sir Nevil macready, the General .Officer Commanding&apos; in Ireland, when ona visit to this country:   .        -(c) That protection should he given, to Sir.James Craig and. Lord Londonderry whenever they visited this country, as well, as to-such, other persons as might be notified, bythe Government of Northern- Ireland or by: the Colonial Office.:

1. The Committee had under consideration a list of the Billsalready introduced in Parliament, and of the Bills pending introduction (CP. 4049).The Committee discussed List I Government Bills now inParliament.The Chief Whip stated that although the list of Bills actually inParliament was a long one, he thought Parliament would be able todeal with them.Some discussion took place on the following Bills : Title of Bill.	Department Responsible.	Observations and Decisions (if any).Clinical Thermometers Extradition    and    Fugitive Offenders Fishery Board (Scotland) Fraud and Falsification National Health Insurance ... Places of Worship (enfranchisement-enfranchisement) Salmon    and    Freshwater Fisheries Solicitors Education .. Universities (Scotland)	Board of Trade and Ministry of Health Colonial Office Scottish Office Ministry of Health ... Attorney-General Minister for Agriculture Lord Chancellor Scottish Office	It was agreed that it might be possible to post-pone this Bill. To be referred back to the Colonial Office with a view to its postponement for the present. Stated to be a matter for agreement between the parties interested, and not of vital importance. It was stated that this would probably be rejected by the Lords. Stated to be very urgent on financial grounds, and likely to give rise to difficulty in con-sequence of the defeat of the Government in Committee. Will be dropped. The Minister for Agriculture agreed to postpone until the autumn. Not to proceed if no time available. Stated to be non-contentious.The Chief Whip continued that of the time available up to the 3rd August, twenty-four full days and four half days, eleven days were allotted for Supply and four or five would be occupied by the Finance Bill, leaving only eight or nine full days and four half days for Government business. The Minister of Labour stated that he desired to warn the Chief Whip that the Prime Minister had given an assurance to a deputation from Boards of Guardians that the question of doing away with &quot; gaps &quot; in the period in which uncovenanted unemployment benefit was payable should be looked into. Should anything of the kind be decided on it would require an amendment of the Unemployment Insurance Act with a consequent demand on parliamentary time. The Committee then proceeded to consider the second list: &quot; Bills recently authorised by the Home Affairs Committee but not yet introduced &quot; : 		Title of Bill.	Department Responsible.	Observations and Decisions (if any).Export Credits Burgh Begisters (Scotland)... Economy (Miscellaneous Pro-visions) Supply of Bread and Flour ...	Board of Trade Scottish Office Board of Trade	The President of the Board of Trade stated that the present Bill was very simple and there would be no opposition, but if, as he under-stood, the Prime Minister decided to extend its operation and to increase the amount, it would become controversial. Not to proceed (in the Commons) if no time available. Very controversial, but urgently required on financial grounds.   To be introduced and pro-ceeded with as early as possible in the following; week. The President of the Board of Trade stated that it might be possible to postpone this until the autumn, although that would leave a small period of time after the expiring regulations had lapsed before the new measure became law.   It was agreed that the matter should be further considered.parliamentary business.
The Committee then proceeded to examine List 3 : &quot; Bills notyet considered by the Home Affairs Committee.&quot;Title of Bill.	Department Responsible.	Observations and Decisions (if any).Weights and Measures Railway and Canal Commis-sion (Consents), Occupation of Land Oxford and Cambridge Royal Commission British Empire Exhibition   ... Legitimation by Subsequent Marriage Rabbits Bill   ...       ...... Industrial Assurance... University of London	Board of Trade War Office   ......... Board of Education ... Board of Trade      ...... Home Office ... Board of Agriculture Home Office ...	The President of the Board of Trade said he would like to have this Bill passed if possible. Must be passed by August 31, if at all. The Chairman stated that this Bill might be introduced in the House of Lords and take its chance, but if necessary he was prepared that it should be carried over until the Autumn Session. Non-controversial. Must be passed in order that the (government guarantee shall not be allowed to lapse. To be referred to the Home Secretary. The President of the Board of Agriculture was prepared to agree to postponement until the autumn. To be referred to the Home Secretary. The Chairman stated that the Lord Privy Seal had suggested that this Bill might be iritro-duced in the House of Lords.The Committee then proceeded to consider List 4 : &quot; Bills notyet submitted to the Home Affairs Committee.&quot;Title of Bill.	Observations and Decisions (if any).Isle of Man (Customs) ... Expiring Laws (Continuance) ... Lights on Vehicles      ...      ... &apos; Post Office Parcels International Corporation Guarantee ... Alderuey Breakwater   ...       ...... Special Constables       .........	An annual measure ; non-controversial. Must be passed. An annual measure ; non-controversial. Must be passed. The Minister of Transport stated that part of this Bill would be very contentious, and agreed that it need not be passed until the autumn. Parliamentaiy Counsel stated that this was an agreed Bill and was very urgent.   It was agreed that it should be passed. The Committee were informed that no decision had yet been taken on the policy underlying this Bill. Agreed to postpone until the autumn. An urgent measure.   It was agreed that this should be passed i.Criminal Procedure (Northern Ireland) (Confirmation) Naval, Military and Air Force Can-teens (Disposal of Receipts) Indemnity (Ireland)     .........	once. To be referred to the Colonial Office. Might be very contentious, but must be passed in order to secure legal power to pay over accumulated monies. It would require a financial resolution. The Committee were of opinion that the Bill would have to be passed. To be postponed until the autumn.The Solicitor-General stated that this Bill was awaiting adecision of the House of Lords in the case of Wilson and the UnitedDairies, which would be given in about - fourteen days and wouldprobably be against the Crown. Very large sums of money were involved. An omnibus Bill would be required, to cover transactionsrelating to the Ministry of Food as well as to the Ministry ofShipping. The Bill would certainly be very controversial. ThePresident of the Board of Trade stated that the Bill was a vital one from the point of view of the Treasury, and if a decision were givenagainst the Crown it would result in a large number of furtheractions being brought.The Committee agreed . To postpone further consideration of the matter until the draftBill was before them.ShippingController.[8565]
The Committee then considered Part III of List 4, consistingof Bills which were believed to be of a less urgent character.Title of Bill.	Observations and Decisions (if any)Solicitors&apos; Remuneration Carriage of Goods by Sea Wild Birds Protection ... Eoyal Naval Reserve  ... Auxiliary Air Force Moneylenders   ... Banks (Audit, Returns and Amalga-mation) Explosives     &apos; ... Board   of   Guardians    (Emergency Powers) Summary Jurisdiction ...

(Modification    of Charges) Jewish Marriages Prevention of Crime Coroners ... Forestry...      ............ Isle of Man Harbours ...	No decision was taken. The Solicitor-General stated that this was to cany out a report of the Imperial Shipping Committee. He thought that it would be possible to get an international agreement, which would be more satisfactory than a Bill. It was therefore decided that the Bill should be postponed. To be postponed. Parliamentary Council stated that only a minor point was involved. Agreed to refer to the Admiralty. Agreed to refer to the Air Ministry. To be postponed. To be postponed. To be referred to the Home Office. It was stated that this Bill was being held in abeyance in case the necessity might arise for its introduction. To be postponed. To be held over until the autumn. To be introduced and held over until the autumn. To be introduced and held over until the autumn. Home Office to be asked whether this Bill could be held over till the autumn or dropped. To be referred to the Ministry of Transport. To be dropped. To be referred to the Home Office. To be dropped. To be held over until the autumn No decision taken.Mr. Rose, on behalf of the Scottish Office, stated that there-were several Scottish Bills in preparation, of which those relatingto Game, Heather-Burning and Deer Forests had been the subjectof several questions in the House of Commons. He would informthe Secretary for Scotland that the Committee would like this to be deferred&apos; till the autumn, if possible. There were also several otherBills, including- two Conveyancy Bills, which might be deferred till the autumn.The Committee concurred in the course proposed, and agreed That the Chairman and the Chief Whip should confer with theDepartments concerned as to those Bills in the above liston which it had not been possible to come to a definite decision.School Teachers 2. With reference to Cabinet 34 (22), Minute 3, the Home(Superannuation) Affairs Committee had under consideration memoranda by theBill. President of the Board of Education (CP. 4027 and CP. 4028)relative to the action to be taken regarding the School Teachers(Superannuation) Bill.The President of the Board of Education informed the Committeethat he was trying to reach some agreement with the teaching profession on the various controversial aspects of the Bill. Thesituation was not as unfavourable as it had been before the SelectCommittee&apos;s investigation, and it was hoped that some compromisemight be reached at a conference that evening with the representativesof the various Teachers&apos; Associations. He (Mr. Fisher) had seenSir James Yoxall on the subject, and, speaking for himself, sir james had expressed a view that the teachers might be persuaded
to withdraw their opposition to the Bill if they could obtain certain concessions, the more important of which were as follows : (a.) That the Bill should be strictly limited in point of time.(b.) That a definite undertaking should be given to the teachersthat the Government would not pass legislation in the 1922 or 1923Sessions setting up a permanent Teachers&apos; Superannuation scheme on a contributory basis. In other words, teachers hoped that no permanent scheme would be imposed upon them during the life ofthe present Parliament, and that they might be able, by the exerciseof political pressure, to secure more favourable consideration for their point of view in the next Parliament.(c.) That power should be taken in the Bill to grant concessions to those teachers in receipt of salaries lower than the appropriateBurnham scale salaries.(d.) It was somewhat surprising that the teachers were notinclined as at present advised to object seriously to the 5 per cent,flat rate contribution, notwithstanding the obvious criticisms whichcould be directed against this particular proposal. The 5 per cent,flat rate in effect meant that the young teachers would be paying forthe old teachers, and in particular that the uncerti floated womenteachers, who might be regarded as the lowest paid members of the profession, had to find a disproportionate part of the cost of the Bill.In this connection he (Mr. Fisher) had informed Sir James Yoxall ofthe two ways in which it might be possible to meet this particularcriticism  -(i.) A pledge might be given that if and when a permanentcontributory system was established account should betaken of and credit given for payments made by teachersunder the Bill in excess of the contributions requiredby the permanent measure ; or(ii.) A graded rate of contributions might be introduced in theBill in place of the 5 per cent, flat rate.There were very serious administrative objections to theadoption of alternative (i), and on the whole alternative (ii1 was thepreferable method; as regards (ii) Sir James Yoxall was of opinion thatthe more inequitable the Bill was as regards rate of contribution the- more unpopular it would be, and he also feared that if a scientificallygraded scale of contributions was once set up it would be moredifficult for the teachers to escape from the contributory scheme.(e.) The President of the Board of Education informed theCommittee that in the House of Commons he had stated that it wasthe Governments intention to limit the duration of the Bill to twoyears, in order to give time for the Inter-departmental Committee to formulate a permanent scheme and for the Government to consider and, if they think fit, legislate on such scheme. While it was important that there should be no overlapping between the schemecontemplated in the Bill and the permanent scheme, it was alsomost important that there should be no gap between the two schemes. ^(-/.) The Committee were informed that the Leader of theHouse was inclined to reply to the teachers that if the provisions ofthe Bill could be continued until December 1924, the Governmentsaw no serious objection to giving an undertaking not to initiate new legislation in the Sessions of 1922 and 1923. On the other hand,the Chancellor of the Exchequer had expressed grave doubts aboutthe wisdom of giving any undertaking to the teaching profession onthis subject, it should be remembered that, from the Treasurypoint of view, the temporary scheme might be more beneficial thanthe permanent scheme. On the other hand, it was urged that whileit was most improbable that the Government would be able to passfresh legislation during the life of the present Parliament, it was
6most undesirable, from a political point of view, to give any under-  IJtaking of the kind demanded by the teachers, and that it might bepossible to avoid giving an undertaking by informing the teachers \that there was no intention of introducing new legislation whichshould overlap the provisions of the present Bill.The Committee agreed That the President of the Board of Education should ascertain the views of the Prime Minister on the question of givingthe teachers the undertaking they desired, the general feeling of the Home Affairs Committee being unfavourable to any such undertaking being given.(g.) The attention of the Committee was directed to the factthat in the great majority of cases the teachers in areas where theProvisional Minimum Scale was still in force were receiving very substantial advances on their 1918 remuneration, and that it wouldbe impracticable and indefensible to make concessions which wouldhave the effect of relieving these teachers&apos; en bloc. At the sametime, there was much to be said for granting special reliefs to thoseteachers who were on the lower limits of the Provisional MinimumScale, and it was suggested that no reduction in respect of the levyshould be made which would bring a particular teachers salarybelow the minimum of the Provisional Minimum Scale.The Minister of Labour thought that care should be taken tosecure that no teacher should receive less than he was in factreceiving in 1918, but it was pointed out that in certain casessalaries had been quite properly reduced since .1918, and that there-fore it wotdd be dangerous to make any general rule of this kind.The Committee agreed (1.) That, should it be found necessary to make some concession in the Committee stage of the Bill in the case of teachersreceiving less than the appropriate Burnham Scale, the concession should take the form of making no reductionfrom the teachers; salary in respect of the levy whichwould bring that salary below the minimum, salary ofthe Provisional Minimum Scale.(2.) That the President of the Board of Education should examine, in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer, the possibility of making some provision tosecure that the effect of the levy should not be to reducesalaries below the scale in force in 1918 in cases wherethat scale was not primd facie excessive.Rate of (h.) With regard to the suggestion that in order to ease the contribution. passage of the Bill the Government might offer to take accounthereafter of payments made by teachers under the temporary measure in excess of contributions required by&apos; the permanent scheme; it was pointed out that as it stood this concession would cost the State a large sum in the two years, and that it would be only equitable if relief was given in this way to the younger teachersto require the older teachers, who would benefit under the temporaryscheme, to bring those benefits into account in the permanent scheme.The Committee agreed That the Inter-departmental Committee should be invited todeal specially in their report with the question of payments made by teachers under the Bill, both where thosepayments are higher and lower than the contributionsrequired by the Departmental Committee&apos;s Scheme, andthat the pledge suggested at (d) (i) above should be simplya pledge to this effect.Special provisions for Teachersreceiving less thanthe BurnhamScales.
Publication of theReport of theGovernmentActuary.Date from whichBill should take effect.(i.) After some discussion, in the course of which, the Committeewere informed that while the President of the Board of Educationhad given to the House of Commons figures taken from theGovernment Actuary&apos;s Report, he had. never actually referred to orquoted that Report, the Committee agreed That in the circumstances it was undesirable that the report othe Government Actuary dated 12th May, 1922, on theSchool Teachers (Superannuation) Bill, 1922, should bepublished.(j.) The Committee were reminded that under Sub-Clause 1 of clause 1 of the Bill, effect was to be given to its provisions from the1st April, 1922. It was now proposed that this date should be altered to the 1st July, 1922, and the cost of this concession to theExchequer would be about 575,000L for the three months, April,May, June, rendering necessarv a further supplementary estimate of200,000?. for 1922-3. If the two years ran from 1st July, 1922, to30th June, 1924, the estimate for -1924-5 would be reduced by theamount of the Supplementary Estimates taken for 1922-23.The Committee agreed That the President of the Board of Education should discussthe question of the date from which the Bill should take effect with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, after thequestion had been discussed in Committee.SrSSfSm 3- The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum byJj111&apos; the President of the Board of Trade (CP. 4033) covering the draftof a Bill confirming the powers of the Board of Trade under theBritish Empire Exhibition Act, 1920, to guarantee losses resultingfrom the holding of the British Empire Exhibition notwithstanding that the date of the exhibition had been altered from the year 1923to 1924,  -The Committee agreed To approve the draft Bill and to authorise the President ofthe Board of Trade to introduce it immediately in Parliament.Rabbits Bill. 4  The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum bythe President of the Roard of Agriculture (CP. 4035) covering thedraft of a Bill enabling local authorities to take steps to destroyrabbits which are causing damage on agricultural land.The Chairman was of opinion that the Bill would be very controversial.The Minister of Agriculture explained that the Bill was on thelines of section 10 of the Corn Production Act of 1917, which hadbeen repealed in the preceding year ; that there was an urgentdemand for it, and that it would not be opposed. In view of thesmall number of members of the Committee present, it was agreed To postpone consideration of the matter until the next meeting.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. I,June 23, 1922.o
Appendix IIIhi U \JX have to request .&apos;our Excellency to callMonsieur   **.**, ^. attention to tho -question of inter-allied indebtedness which recent events have renderedacute,     as Your Ibccelleney Is doubtless aware,, the warlebts due to Great Britain by her Allies amount in theaggregate to   ; or excluding Bnssla, to4  ; a sum on which she has so far ashed for no payment of Interest, still lose for any repayment ofcapital.     On the other hand she owes the U.3a sum*   of   on which interest has to be paid andwhich, as m are now informed, ist  bo converted from anunfunded into a funded debt.Shese demands, Maaich havo boon put forward withthe most perfect courtesy, are within the undoubtedright of the American Government,   - Whey were clearly eon-templated in the original contract, and Groat Britain&apos;neither c explains of the - procedure, nor denies the obliga-t ion *.&apos;  But evidently this country cannot treat the practicalproblem thus presented te it as if the transaction cut ofwhich it arose was an isolated incident in which only the*3.A. and Great Britain have any concern.     Shis country has been asked to meet its obligations as a debtor and it proposes unconditionally to do so.     Bat it cannot forgetthat if it has obligations as a debtor,&quot; it also has- rights as a creditor, and that if the obligations are to been forced, the rights cannot bo left tiJiolly in abeyance.Hie 7.ia;jsety*s Government do not conceal the fact thatthey adopt this change of policy with the greatest regret.Itmls true that Groat Britain is owed more than it owes,and that if all -later-allied wag&amp;ebts were paid the british treasury would, on balance, gain by the transaction.     but his Majesty^ Government have always doubted whether the
present world situation could best be treated from thisnarrow financial stand-point.     It Is true that many ofthe allied and Associated Powers, are as &quot;between eachother, creditors or debtors or both.     Bat they wore,and are, much more.     They were partners In the greatestinternational effort over made in the cause of freedom;and they are still partners In dealing with some, atleast, of its results.     Their debts were incurred,their loans wore made, not for tho separate advantageof particular states, but for a great purpose common tothorn all, and that purpose has beer? in the main aoeora-plished.To generous minds it can never be agreeable,. ,although, for reasons of state, it may GoiieolvabXy benecessary, to treat the monetary aspect of this groatevent as a thing apart, to be tern from its historicalsotting and regarded as no more than an ordinary oom-mercial dealing between traders vmc borrow and capitalistswho. land.     There are moreover reasons of a differentorder, which increase the distaste with which HisMajesty&apos;s Government adopt so fundamental a change intheir policy respecting loans to allies.     She economic  3&amp;j;ills from which the world is suffering are duo to manycauses, moral and material * which are quite outsidethe scope of this despatch.     But among them mastcertainly bo reckoned the weight of international in-debte&amp;nose with all Its unhappy effects upon credit and exchange, upon national production and international trade,     The peoples of all countries long for a speedyreturn to the normal;   bat how can the normal be reachedwhile conditions so abnormal are permitted to prevail?Prom this point of view, therefore, some generalarrangement seems eminently desirable;   and in the meanwhile Groat Britain has done her best to mitigate
the difficulties of -the present situation by makingno elate upon those of her allies who through their participation in tho war are among her debtors.But this policy seems only tolerable so long asit is generally accepted.     it cannot be&apos;right thatone partner in the common enterprise should be requiredto pay all that she has borrowed and recover nothing that -she hm lent. Such a procedure &apos;is contraryto every principle or natural justice, and cannot beexpected to commend itself to the people of this country.They are suffering from an unparalleled feurdeu of taxation,from an immense diminution in national wealth, from serious-want of employment and from the severe curtailment of useful expenditure. .   $heae evils are courageously horne.But when- they are increased through demands, howeverlegitimate, made by one of their associates in the greatthe- British taxpayers will inevitably&apos; ask whetherthis now burden can fairly be fastened upon their shoulders:alone.To this question there can he hut one answer,, andI am convinced that allied opinion v/ili admit its justice.But, w. lie His L!a;)esty&apos;s Government arc thus, regretfullyconstrained to request the   drench)   Government tomake- arrangements at their.earliest convenience for deal-ing with Anglo-French loans, they desire to explain thatthe interest and repayment for which they ask depend not so much on what France and other allies owe to GreatBritain as on what Great Britain las to pay to America. .The policy favoured by Els lla;jesty&apos;o Government is, as1 have already observed, that of writing off, through onegreat, transaction,, the whole body of inter-allied -Indebtedness,     But, if this be ibund Impossible of
- accomplishment, we wish it to he understood that we donot in any event desire to make a profit out of any less satisfactory arrangement.     In no- circumstances do we propose to ask mere from our debtors than Is neeesoaryto pay. to our creditors.     And,- while we do not ask for more, all will admit that we can hardly be content with less.,For it should not be forgotten, though it sometimes is.,that our liabilities were incurred for others, not for our-aelves,     She food, the raw material t the munitions requiredby the immense naval and military efforts of this country were paid for, not by means of foreign loans, hut by internal&apos;borrowing and war taxation.     But a similar policy was beyond the power of other European nations.    -Appealwas made to fee United States of America, and in substance,if not in form, the &quot;United States Insisted that, thoughour allies were to spend the money, It was only on our security that they were prepared to lend it.. Before concluding this despatch, I may bo permitted to offer one or two further observations, in order to makestill clearer the spirit in which His ?%Jesty3s government desire to deal with the thorny problem of internationalindebtedness.-\This after all is not a question merely between allies,,Ssc-eneray countries also are involved:, for the greatest of -all international debtors is Germany.     How His Majesty&apos;sGovernment do not suggest that, either as a matter of Jibticeor expediency, Germany should be relieved of her obligationto Prance or other allied states,      bey content themselves with saying that, so deeply are they convinced of tho economicinjury inflicted on the world by the existing state ofthings, that, if any general plan were proposed by which thequestion could bo dealt with as a whole, Great Britain forher part would be prepared to abandon any claim to repayment
of the loans she has inade, and all nor righto in german reporation, provided that sirall aa? treatment was meted out to her.     A general settlement would bo of more value than any gains that could accrue even from the most successful enforcement of legal obligations.Sth July,1922
