M. PGINGARE&apos;S (l) The Prime Minister stated that two days ago announcerIMPOSEDVISIT. ments had been made in the French Press that M. Poincare&quot;proposed to visit London on August 1st.   At midday on theprevious day the Prime Minister had received a proposal tothis effect from Paris.It was recalled that on the occasion of M.Poincare&apos;s previous visit he had particularly been ashed to come, ifpossible, in July.   August was inconvenient to british ministers, not only because it would interrupt the vacation,,but also because it was doubtful whether the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs would have sufficiently recoveredto take part.    Further, it was doubtful whether an ItalianMinistry would yet have been formed, or at any rate wouldhave been sufficiently long in office to enable its PrimeMinister and Foreign Secretary to come to London.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed --That the Acting Secretary of State forForeign Affaires should reply to theeffect, that the British Government had understood, at the time of his lastvisit, that M, poincare&apos; would be ableto pay a further visit to England duringthe last half of July, which vntild havesuited&apos; them better than August,   TheBritish Government would, however, beglad to welcome M, Poincare&apos; any day during the following week for the pur-pose of discussing --RFPARATIONS - though no indicationShould be given thatwe had any plan topropos e.THE NEAR FAST.TANGIER.&apos;This, however, should be subject to theunderstanding that the questions of Repara-tions and the Near East could not be dis-cussed in the absence of a representativeof the Italian Government, and to the datebeing convenient to the Spanish Governmentfor the discussion of Tangier.The Acting Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (Lord Balfour) undertook that, ifthe Conference took place and if Lord Curzoncould not return in time to take part, hewould forego for a few days a cure he hadbeen advised by his medical attendant to undergo, and to remain in London until theend of next week.
\C;&apos;iMGRATULA- (S) The Prime Minister, on behalf of the Cabinet.TIONS TOTHE LORD        congratulated Lord Balfour on his 74th birthday, and on president of the COUNCIL, his success at the recent meeting of the Council of theThe Palestine League of Nations in London in obtaining approval to theMandate. -Palestine Mandate.
THE^NGLO- (3)    With reference to Cabinet 40 (82), Conclusion 2,AMERICANDEBT, AND       the Cabinet had before them a revised draft of a despatchINTER-ALLIEDINDEBTEDNESS.to Allied debtor Governments on the subject of inter-Alliedindebtedness, prepared by the Acting Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, with a covering-note by the Secretary tothe Cabinet (Paper C.P.-4112).Tbe Acting Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reminded the Cabinet that earlier versions of the despatchhad been before them and that the policy embodied in ithad met with tmanimons approval, although there had subse-quently been a certain wavering, partly on the ground thatthis was not the best way to deal with the United States ofAmerica, and partly because the embarrassment consequent upon the fall of the Mark made it an inopportune moment toask debtors to liquidate their debts.   He had had a confer-ence with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the british ambassador - to the United States, as the result of which certain modifications had been made in the draft to meet their criticisms, end there had been an important penultimatesentence added.   He had never been a bigoted advocate of thepolicy proposed, but he had seen no reason to change it.Least of all was he convinced by the argument based on thefall of the Mark.    In his opinion,the deeper Europe sankinto the morass the more was the need for raising the flagand declaring that our selfishness would not stand in theway of a settlement;    but it must be part of a general settlement.The Chancellor of the Exchequer disagreed with the acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in regard tothe unanimity of the Gabinet,   He himself had never beenin favour of the policy now proposed.   He was for meetingthe American demand according to its tenour, but he was alone
and on that- occasion the Lord Privy Seal was absent.    TheCabinet had asked Lord Balfour to prepare a draft, and whenthe draft came before the Cabinet he (the Chancellor of  the exchequer) confined his criticism to it and not to the policybehind it.   $ranting the policy of the Cabinet, then nobetter draft was possible than the brilliant one beforethem.   The question to which he wished to address himself was, - what would be the result of the publication of thedespatch?    He thought- its policy profoundly wrong.   We were bound to pay our debt to the United States, whatever theform of payment and time of payment.    That was recognised by all.    The United States had asked us to go to washington in order to make arrangements for funding the debt.   He didnot see how we could postpone doing so, because, if we did,we - might get worse terms.   It was worth our while to attemptto placate the United States of America.   If he were simply to consult - his own. natural. feelings he would let the draftgo out., but the effect of its publication would be a contrc-versy with the United States.   The Prime Minister had described it as a &quot;rebuke&quot;.    it held up the United states as.a Shylock when they ought to be generous.    The precisearrangements in regard to funding might be made easy ordifficult.    On the one hand we might be forced to grantbonds at 4$fc per cent, for a funding period of 25 years.That would be a grievous burden.    The Americans were entitledto bonds which they could put on the market.   They might do this in such a way as to ruin our credit, for our creditwould be determined by the amount which could be got forthese bonds in the markets of the world.    There was no ques-tion that the United States were entitled to demand bondswhich were marketable, and when put upon the market theywould cons-alt their own interests and not ours.   The American
,19 point of view would be to say, &quot;Great Britain is a gooddebtor, and. we are entitled to ask for the payment of ourdebt;   yo\i must pay according to your bond&quot;.   The Chancellorof the Exchequer illustrated, this attitude by reading anadvertisement issued in the United States of America bythe Harriman National Bank.   Proceeding, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer said that there were alleviations which we might be able to secure, and which, indeed, there was a good chance of our securing:   for example, a lower rate of inter-est and an extension of the. funding period.    The FinancialCommission might be persuaded to suggest these alleviationsto Congress.   It might also be possible to arrange that the bonds should be held by the United States Treasury, and notbe marketable.    He was assured that leaders of public opinion,like ivir Hughes and the Secretary of the Treasury, did not wish&apos; to exact the debt from us in its entirety, and that they believed that in a.year or two they would be in a positionto cancel what remained outstanding.   There were Americanswho held that Great Britain should be given the same chanceas Prance:    but even short of that, it ought to be possibleto secure some modification of the rate of interest, the timeof payment and the kind of bonds in which payment was to bemade.   He had discussed the matter with many prominentAmericans, and he was convinced that Americans were not going to be appeased by being held up as the sole exactorof debt;   rather, the effect would be to irritate them.Turning to the condition of Europe, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer said that the fall of the Mark had profoundlyaffected the position.    It was stated in the draft despatchthat we would not ask for payment if demands were not beingmade upon us.   At the same time we were telling the French that Germany should be let off some of her reparation debt,-5-
0 K Q^ 3! oThe french would retort, &quot;You are about to exact payments from us;    therefore we must exact payment from Germany;   itwill take all \5/e g*at from Germany to pay you. and the UnitedStates;   we cannot, therefore, let Germany off&quot;.   Althoughthe Bankers had said that Germany could pay  125,000,000per annum -- it would be less today -- there would requireto be exacted from Germany by France, in order to meet ourclaims and those of the United States,  259,000,000 perannual.    In effect, Germany would become the sole debtor,and her position would be made much worse.   The Mark would fall still further, and we should see Germany travellingin the track of Austria.The Prime Minister said that that would make theUnited States of America primarily responsible.The chancellor of the Exchequer said the i\mericanbankers did not care about the state of Europe,   In con-elusion, he repeated that he could not too strongly emphasizehis conviction that the policy embodied in the despatch wouldmake the position infinitely worse.- The Minister of Health suggested that the policy would have a bad effect on the course of the Franc and Lira,and no-one knew where it would end.The Secretary of State for the Colonies reminded theCabinet that this subject had already been twice discussed and a decision reached by an overwhelming majority.    he recalled that the Minister of Health had stated that he did not wish to alter a word of the British document *    TheCabinet had decided to send a Delegation to the UnitedStates to arrange the funding of the debt, and at the sametime a despatch was to be published to the world.   Theformer half of the decision had been announced to the public,-6-
0 but the despatch had been withheld..   This, he thought, was hardly a satisfactory procedure.   On the merits of the ques-tion he thought that we owed the announcement of policy toour people.   Our attitude was not, and should not be, oneof quivering fear before the United States.   We were boundto. put before our people the broad position which we took up.In view of the state ef Europe this was a righteous and a proper document, enunciating a policy of wisdom, firmnessand broad justice.   He thought it would be so understoodand that it would result in our Allies gathering themselvesunder the shield of England.   He did not believe it would cause a panic.   Our European debtors would know that theywere not in fact being called upon to pay.   The Chancellorof the Exchequer had invited the Cabinet to believe that ifthe despatch were withheld and we sent a Delegation over to washington, some mitigation of our debt would follow.   Hehad even suggested that there was some hope that we might belet off and dealt with on the same terms as Prance.   Thiswas but a pious, illusory and vain hope, based on no reason-able foundation.&apos;  On the other hand, it was equally imaginarythat the United States would put the pincers in the fire and begin to tease and torture us.   The Cabinet were also told that Mr Hughes and his colleagues were favourable tothis country.   If that were so, it was absurd to suggestthat they would insist on putting bonds on the market in such,a way aa to : harass -as.   The central fact which the cabinet should hold in mind was that we had a right to say to ourpublic where we stood.   The effect in Europe would not, he held, be injurious, nor would it be resented in the UnitedStates after the first momentary irritation had passed away.They wo till be driven to search their consciences and askthemselves whether they were in the right.   Publication would-7-
would not be followed by retributive measures devised tospite us.   He begged the Cabinet not to go back on theirpolicy.   It would be a cruel wrong to the British people to force them to give up all that was owing to them while at the same time compelling them to pay every farthing they. owed.The Lord Privy Seal confessed that he felt gravelyanxious about the despatch.   He had not seen eye to eye .with his colleagues on the question of inter-Allied debts,but he fully agreed with all his colleagues felt about theselfishness and, he might almost say, the insolence of theofficial attitude of America.   He also joined in theCabinet*s admiration of the despatch itself if it were decided to send one on the lines of the draft.   But he was afraid that the more brilliant and conclusive the characterof the despatch the more ruinous would be its effect.   he recalled what had taken place.   We had invited the UnitedStates to join in a general treatment of the problem.    Theyhad refused,  and had declared that it was not their policy to do so;    it was tho duty of borrowers to pay, but incases of misfortune they would consider what relief mightbe extended to their debtors.   Having made our pzoposal fora policy of general remission of debts, it was incompatible,in his (Mr Chamberlain&quot;a) view, with our dignity and ourprimacy as a world Power to ask again, and as a favour, what had been refused to us when advanced in the interests of world peace..    In the next place, unless the United Statesreleased tie quite willingly and of their own motion, he was afraid of the future effect on Anglo-American re3a tions ifit were possible for Americans on every suitable occasionin future to boast that they had let us off.   The immediatesaving of  50,000,000 would be spent over and over again in our subsequent loss of credit.    In the third place,
we ought to consider- the of feet of the publication of this despatch on our international relations.   He understood thatour Ambassador considered that it would be little short ofdisastrous .The British Ambassador at Washington^ interjecting, saidthat the Lord Privy Seal had misunderstood his position andwas not representing the view he held.The Lord Privy Seal, continuing, regretted that he hadmisrepresented Sir Auckland Gedd.es, but it was his belief that the despatch would raise ah outcry in the United. Statesand would lead to the expression of such, unfair and cruelcriticism as would undo the work of Lord Balfour and theWashington Conference.   He did not agree that its effect inEurope would be as described by the Secretary of State forthe.Colonies .   Our Allies would feel, with added bitterness,what we felt in regard to the United States. France would point to her devastated regions and hold us up to obloquy.Lastly, he ashed, what should we gain by this policy? It wasa gesture- which could not be followed by action.The Secretary &quot;of Statefbr the Colonies pointed out thatif America insisted we would pay,, but it was not part of theCabinet&quot; s polio;/ to insist on full payment by Prance.The Lord Privy Seal did not think the despatch made thatclear.    In any case, he agreed with the Chancellor of theExchequer that publication would add to the disasters ofEurope.   We would be regarded as gibbeting the United Statesbefore the world.   They might deserve that, but it was a madpolicy to pursue;   it would destroy our good relations withthe United States, and would increase the dislike (already considerable) felt for England in Prance and Italy,Some discussion followed as to the precise meaning ofthe text of the despatch in lines 4 and 5 of page 3:-
n &apos;j&apos; rj&quot;His Maiesty*s Government do not concealthe fact that they adopt this change ofpolicy with the greatest regret.&quot;The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign affairs explained that what was said was in effect, &quot;We have a rightto ash everything from France, hut in no circumstances willwe go.to the length of doing so, but only to the length ofthe exactions of the United States from us&quot;.   In fact, wewore ashing from France less than she owed.The President of theBo&amp;rd of Education said he thought the result would bo to bring relief to Prance.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that was only ifthe United States gave way.The Acting Secretary of Stats for Foreign Affairsreplied that the document did not suggest we .would not pggrAmerica if we did not gat money from France, and he read the opening sentence of paragraph* These demands, which have been put forward with most perfect courtesy, are within the undoubted right of the American Government&quot;.The President of the Board of Education thought it shouldbe made clearer that we proposed to send a Delegation,The Secretary of State for the Colonies contended thatwhile in the document we said (paragraph 3) that we made no complaint of the procedure of the Amieriean Government, thewhole meaning of the despatch was a complaint of the pro-cedure .)
)    The PRIME MINISTER then invited air Auckland Geddesjto state his opinion of the probable effect on american public opinion of the publication of the despatch.SIR AUCkLAHD GEDDES said that as requested he wouldconfine himself to the point put by the Prime Minister.With regard to the action of the Harriman national Bank,he thought their advertisement was rather good evidence thatthe United States were moving towards cancellation, or atany rate, a more generous treatment of their debtors.     TheHarriman interests had in the past co-operated with Irishpropagandists and were also partly inspired from Berlin.Whatever action Great Britain took these interests would continue to foment Anglo-American misunderstandings.next:    with regard to important statesmen like Mr Hughes,the Secretary of the Treasury, and their followers, theywould look at the question of the debt solely and entirelyas Americans and from the American standpoint.     They wouldnot be moved by anything we said or did.     He believed thatthey were convinced that it was in American interest thatthere should be a large measure of alleviation, because they feared the effect on American business of the full payment.He (Sir Auckland Geddes) agreed that nothing ought to be done at this moment to irritate American public opinion and hewould be unwilling to see His Majesty&apos;s Government issue a document which in the text pilloried the American Government.Some sentences in the earlier draft, he thought, had that effect.    If the present draft were published its effect inthe United States would somewhat as follows:-   the Democraticpapers would at once proclaim the wide generosity of theBritish Government in announcing the great cancellation ofEuropean debts:    the higher class Republican newspapers would try to minimise the effect of the despatch on the mind,, of-11-
the-United States.     She Hurst and the less reputablepress would misrepresent the British position and do all they could to create,treble.     He did not think there wasif torn from its contextmuch, if anything, left in the document which/would givethe Hurst press much ammunition.Proceeding to summarise his views, Sir Auckland Geddessaid that the despatch would not affect Mr Hughes in theleast as a man, hut it would as a party man.    The Secretary!of the Treasury was a man of no strong party feelings,    Thedespatch would stir up excitement among Americans of anti-British sympathies, of whom there were far more than was realised in this country,     Our relations with the UnitedStates did not begin and end &quot;with the debt,    There was, forexample,  the Ship Subsidy Bill.    It and other signs allpointed to a period of strain between the two countries inthe not very distant future.    There was a party in theUnited States desirous of active good will with us but themajority were far from having reached that mental attitude.If. the despatch, were published it would have this permanenteffect:    the Americans of good will would have a document,(whose signature was of itself of considerable importance)signed by Lord half our^ to which they would point and use  -as a mirror to whew how the world viewed Americans.    the document merely stated facts.    In the long run it would dogood and help us when we came to the Ship Subsidy Bill.In his opinion it did not help us to be unduly lenient withthe United States.    He thought it was better to hit back andihit hard at once.     It was no use deceiving ourselves bywethinking that they thought as Jdssgr did on internationalquestions,    What they asked themselves was - could thiscountry help them?       The despatch should be couched interms of the most complete courtesy, and as they were ratherslow thinkers they should not be irritated by any expected
movement.     The. despatch would be of great use inthe hands of the Democrats, and at the Electionsthe Republicans would no doubt endeavour to toneit down.      He could offer no opinion of its effect on European states.
3?he Prime   Minister stated that on the question ofprocedure he thought the Chancellor of the Exchequer hadbeen right in urging the reconsideration of the documentin view of the startling event which had occurred inEurope since the Cabinet settled their general line ofpolicy.     SPhe situation created by the collapse of the markwas a very grave one, and the whole subject of InternationalIndebtedness was being re-considered as a result of that new fact.     Further, it was desirable to review the positionInasmuch as M, Poincare was intending to come over next week with, it was said, new -proposals.     He himself had notaltered his views in the least.He did not think the immediate effect on Europe of thepublication of the Despatch would be good.     It would makeFrance and Italy a little angry with us.    They would prefer to quarrel with, us rather, than with the United States.   Butit was time we asserted ourselves and made clear that thiswhole trouble ought not to be settled at our expense.   Wewere enduring a most burdensome taxation.     In othercountries taxes were less high and they were not, in fact,all being collected.   V/e were expected to bear this un-exampled burden and also to pay all our debts.As to the United States, he agreed with our ambassador that nothing is to be gained by being too apologetic.   why should we be apologetic to the United States?     All wecould gain by cringing would be perhaps some ten or fifteenraillions.     It was not worth bartering our self-respectend suing in forma pauperis.     (Phey had taken advantage ofour complications in War to try and capture our International

We could point to the large number of air squadrons she was building - a policy if which persisted inwould force us to do the same -With regard to the document itself, he agreed it was a powerful and great statement, but he would like to see it putmore clearly in the forefront of the Despatch that we were offering to forgive the whole of Europe*s debt to us.   Europeowed us  3,300,000,000.     *Ve were of meeting to forgive this ifthe United States were prepared toacforgive us  950,000,000.He had nonobjection, if it was thought desirable, to deductthe figures of the Bossiest Debt&apos; to us.   He thought the Despatchwould. * * *
3fi QO \J owou^d have a weighty effect on the Administration atWashington.   The Republicans were largely dependent onthe German vote   in parts absolutely dependent - whichwould be influenced by the fact that we were prepared toforgive Germany*s whole indebtedness to us if our own war debt were remitted by the United States of America.The Secretary of State for War interjected that a largeItalian vote would be similarly affected.The Prime Minister, continuing, said our policy shouldbe put forward as an attempt to wipe out international indebt-edness in order to give the world a fresh start.   The americans were ignorant of some of the great facts of the War.   Theyhad no adequate idea of the magnitude of the war effort ofthe Allies.   The United states lost what - Australia lost.The publication of this document, and the controversy towhich it would give rise, would have important educationalresults on American opinion.   He would have a paragraphstating quite unequivocally that we were prepared to forgivethe whole of the debt of the Allies and of Germany to us.That was, the basis of our new policy, and he &apos;would like a paragraph which, even if torn out from its contest, wouldmake that absolutely plain.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that the sum owedto Britain by Germany was  1,453,000,000, or 22 per cent, of 5,600,000,000.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (lord balfour) suggested that the opening passage in *Dn should be expressed in a little more friendly way, by saying that HisMajesty&apos;s Government wished &quot;to deal to the best of their ability with the Anglo-French loan,&quot;
The Cabinet agreed --(a) To approve the draft despatch to theAllied debtor countries (Paper 0.P,-4-112), subject to amendments to thefollowing e ffeet:-(i) The second paragraph to be amended so as to contrast with the Britishdebt to the United States of America(&quot;850,000,000) not only the war debtsdue to Great Britain by her Allies( 2,000,000,000)9 as in the present draft, but also the debt due fromGermany on account of reparations,making an aggregate total of mmx 3,452,000,000, &apos;which would be re-rnitted if the British policy were adopted:(ii) Paragraph. D on page 3, fifth line:for the words &quot;for dealing withAnglo-French loans&quot; put some such,words as *to deal to the best oftheir ability with Anglo-French,loans&apos;&apos; 0(b) To leave the incorporation of these andany consequential amendments to the Act-ing Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(Lord Balfour).The Lord.
