(l) With reference to Cabinet 22 (22), Conclusion 5,the Secretary of State for the Colonies made a statement on the subject of the general position in Ireland (Appendix).In view of the forthcoming departure of the PrimeMinister and several of his Cabinet colleagues, Mr Churchillasked for some general guidance as to the attitude to betaken up by the Cabinet in the not inconceivable contin--geney of the proclamation of an Irish Republic. He alsoread a letter from lord Midleton,describing the difficult situation of Southern Unionists in existing conditions.Mr Churchill indicated that the serious situationhe had depicted might be exaggerated, but, in the circumstances-stances of the Prime Minister&apos;s imminent departure, he had felt it necessary to inform the Cabinet of all the diffi-culties and dangers of the situation.There followed a general discussion as to the policy to be adopted in the contingency contemplated.One of the main difficulties of the situation was realised to arise from, the fact that Mr Arthur Griffithand Mr Michael Collins considered it vital and indispensable to the success of the policy of the Treaty to avoid strikingthe first blow against the republicans,  or any preparatorysteps which might be regarded as provocative.   Any british military or police support at the present stage would provedisastrous to the Provisional Government.It was pointed outthat the present position of weak-ness in which the Provisional Government was placed, andwhich gave widespread opportunities to the disorderlyelements in the population, resulted directly from, theinsistence of the Provisional Government on the withdrawalof British forces, which they had failed to.replace by forces on which they could rely.TTot reproduced, owing to its great secrecy.
nrhere was general approval of the Prime Minister1 sproposition that, the British Government could not allow the republican flag to fly in Ireland.   A point might come whenit would he necessary to tell Mr Collins that if he was unable to deal with the situation the British Governmentwould have to do so.Some discussion took place as to the expediency ofexerting economic pressure in the contingency contemplated,and, more particularly, as to whether it should take theform of a technical&apos; blockade.    The Cabinet were informedthat the question had been examined by a technical Sub-Committee, which had come to the conclusion that, if foreigncountries were not to take advantage of the situation to exploit their own trade with Ireland and to some extent torender our economic pressure nugatory, a technical blockadewas the only suitable machinery.After considerable discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) mo approve the instructions read by theSecretary of State for War to the GeneralOfficer Commanding-in-Chief in Irelandprescribing the action to be taken by him, &apos;        in the event of the proclamation of are public in Ireland (Appendix II):(b) To approve the issue to the ProvisionalGovernment of Ireland of the furtherconsignments of arms asked for by them,as recommended by the General OfficerCommanding-in-Chief and the Chief of theImperial General Staff:(c) nhat the Secretary of State for the Colonies&apos; should write to the Provisional Governmentof Ireland,  formally calling attention tothe very serious state of affairs in Ireland,and asking for information as to how they proposed to deal with the situation:(d) That, in order to provide for the personalsafety of the Viceroy, who is at presentguarded only by the Dublin MetropolitanConstabulary  . not a reliable force against an attack by the Irish-Republican Army  the Secretary of State for the colonies should summon the Viceroy to London,ostensibly for purposes of consultation:
(S) Shat a Sub-Committee of the Committee ofImperial Defence should he appointed toconsider the situation and the naval,military, and air measures acquired tomeet certain contingencies which might arise out of the present situation;  thesaid contingencies to he specified bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies.IRELAND     (2)    With reference to Cabinet 6 (22), Conclusion 10,Compensation     the Cabinet -CommissionApproved the appointment of LordShaw of Dunfermline as Chairman ofthe Commission which is to deal with claims for compensation in respectof injuries sustained in the recentconflict in Ireland.(Paper CP.3648)
(3) With reference to Cabinet, 12 (22), Conclusion 2,the Cabinet had before thera the following documentsMemorandum by the Secretary of State- forthe Colonies, eirctilating translation ofa letter from King Feisal to Sir Percy Cox,dated February 23, 1922 (Paper G.P.-5903);Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary ofState for the Colonies to the High Commis-sioner of Iraq (Paper CP.-3923);Paraphrase Telegram from the High Commis-sioner of Iraq to the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies (Paper C.P.-3924);Paraphrase Telegram from the High Commis-sioner of Iraq to the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies tPaper G.P.-3925).&quot;he Secretary of State for the Colonies read to theCabinet telegrams which he had recently exchanged with sir percy Cox on the.qnestion of Feisal&apos;s attitude (a) to article &quot;V of the proposed Treaty with Iraq, and (b) to theMandate of the League of Nations (papers CP.-3923, and cp.-3934).    From the correspondence it appeared that sir percy Cox is of opinion that the Foreign Office form ofArticle V &quot;would injure Peisal&apos;s prestige vitally&quot; (paper,P.-3903).    In addition to the difficulty on this point,Peisal had put forward a request for the formal - abrogationof the Mandate, and was not satisfied with the absence of ireference to the mandatory authority&apos;in the preamble of th*Treaty.    He (Mr Churchill) had discussed this point with sir Arthur Balfour and Mr Fisher, and they were all agreedthat to accede to Feisal&apos;s request would raise serious intnational difflenities.Mr Churchill, continuing, said that there were twocourses open to the Cabinet:-(i)  To go to the League of Rations and sayfrankly.what tbe position is   thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government had faithfullycarried out the spirit of the Mandate,ask their approval to the last paragraphin Sir Percy Cox&apos;s telegram (Parser C.P.-3824) and postpone the conclusion of theTreaty an the meantime:
(ii) To send Feisal a firm telegram complaining of his action in hastily dis^dssinn hisrainisters without- consulting the High Commissioner, and stating that if bo is not pre-pared to go on with the Treaty with Article Vrevised irrhia favour wo "would drop treaty negotiations altogether.   This alternativecould ho pushed still further * and wo couldstate that wo =====would drop both the Sroatyand the Ltandate. and evacuate iKiq.On the whole, ho preferred the foriaer alternative.   Peisalwanted the closest relations with us 9 but not the Mandate *and in feet the Mandate was of no help to us*The Prime Minister asked had the subject been dis-oussed with the French Government?   It was important that weshould mroh in step with Pranoe.   He was not sure&apos;that wowanted the Mandate5 and he did not soe what we rained "by it.The President of the Board of Education stated thatFaisal was clearly anxious for the rights of representation in this country.   Oould wo not say that we would j-rant these rights if he accepted the Mandate?The Lord Privy Seal suggested that we mlfht soy inthe "yroaty that we were prepared to ash the Lea rue of nations to substitute the Treaty for&apos; the Mandate.The President of the Board of rJduoatiOn stated thatthe, Treaty was not inconsistent with the Mandate.   It was important to v&amp;mtitoev that the United States Govestaaentjbasing themselves on the ground that they had helped to win the War* were making difficulties about the Mandates to iraq and Palestine, and the Lord President of the Council was strongly against our risking a quarrel with the United states on the subject.   It should be possible9 alto, the issue ofthe Mandate , to tp later on to the League of Nations 9 point-in g out that Iraq had achieved the statua of an independentnation and that.the Mandate ought to be renounced.   Therewould be difficulty with the Lee ue of Mations ,in carryingout Mr Chamberlain&apos;s su-rostlon.
ov In reply to a question, Sir John ShueKburgh and MrLawrence agreed that if the Treaty were not proceeded with it was unlikely that disturbances would take place unlesspossibly in the event of the resignation of the Prime minister on the plea that we were again attempting to enslave Iraq.The Secretary of State for the Colonies read thedraft of a reiJly? prepared by the Foreign Office t to Sir percy cox&apos;s telegram (Appendix III).The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet a letter hehad received from the Secretary.of State for Foreign.Affairs9who was unable to be present (Appendix IV).The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointed outthat oil the Foreign Office version of Article V Feisal wouldhave a right to appoint an Agent in London.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State for theColonies should telegraph to Sir percy cox to the effect that we were prepared^&quot;:to conclude a Treaty with Article V amendediubject to agree- - -ITS VSB sense of tile colonial Oxllce.  version^.lent on other that we were not prepared&apos; formally to abrogatessues; the Mandate;    and that unless we. had Feisal&apos;sactive co-operation we should have no alterna-tive but to contemplate the .evacuation ofIraq.

f(this  DOCUMEFT IS TIPS PR OPERTY of^jaRITAKmCMAJ^TY^S OOVERMplHT) a1 -----------    ! - ,COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.SUB-COMMITTEE OK IRELAND,The situation in Ireland has now taken a turn in whichvarious important contingencies must he considered.   Thereis no reason to doubt the good faith of the ProvisionalGovernment nor the good will of the Treaty Party whosupport them in the Dail0     There is every reason tobelieve that the great mass of the people in Ireland would gladly vote for the Treaty and the Free state     On theother hand the Irish Republican Army, which we have notrecognised, but to which we have been forced to hand overa number of barracks Con the assurance that it would obeythe Provisional Government) now appears to be largelyunreliable, and the Provisional Government appears to be incapable of withstanding the extremists^2e     Upon review of all the circumstances, it soems clearthat there may be a strong effort to overthrow the presentProvisional Government before the elections under theTreaty can take place in Ireland,3*       It must be understood that we should not recogniseor parley with an Irish Republican Government in any circumstances; and that the mere fact of its being broughtinto being would constitute a state of war between itand the British Empire.His Majesty&apos;s Government stand fast by the treaty as their full and final offer, neither adding to nordetracting from those provisions&apos;.
5,      It is imperative that the action we should take in the various foreseen or imaginable contingenciesshould now be carefully thought out by the military,,naval and Ksmt&amp;ibm. aviation authorities,6,      A coup d&apos;etat might take one of at least three possible forms :!-(i)   A coup d&apos;etat might be made in Dublin withthe object of forcibly overthrowing the ProvisionalGovernment and setting up a Republican Government *In that contingency the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief will at once proclaim martial lawp attack the Republican Government and seize all personstailing part in the conspiracy for its establishment.This should be done irrespective of the view takenby the Provisional Government.   The present garrison of Dublin is believed to be adequate for all purposesso far as Dublin and its immediate surroundings areconcerned.   It can be reinforced with great rapidityfrom England,(2)   A Republican Government might be set up outsideDublin.   In that event we should at once call uponthe Provisional Government to take effective stepsto wage war upon the Republican forces.   Such a coupd!etat would open up the following alternatives:-(a)    It might be resisted by the ProvisionalGovernment and other loyal elements.   In that event an endeavour should be made to rally theNorth and all elements in the country favourable to the Treaty on one side and form an army outOf,a 0 o * o c
of them wherewith to march against and attack the Republican forces.   It is not improbable thatthe North \70Uld assist, but it is doubtful ifthe Provisional Government would consent tofight alongside the North for the Treaty,.(to)   A coup dsetat in the provinces, on the otherhand, might not be met by an effective protestoh the part of the Provisional Government andother loyal elements.   If the whole of the twenty-six counties quietly accepted the republic and no serious attempt were made to resist it, weshould be confronted with a different situation.There would not then be civil war betweenthe Treaty Party and the Republicans, but onlya Republic in which the people of the whole country will have acquiesced, and in all probability civil war between Northern Irelandand the Southern Republic.    In that event theBritish Army should not invade except whereconvenient the territories of the Republic.Dublin and possibly certain other ports should be held.   Flying columns should attack the centres of the Republican Government whereverset up, but speaking broadly there should be no permanent occupation of towns in Southern Ireland.For the protection of Ulster the British army should also hold the best military line in theNorth irrespective of the Ulster boundary(presumably the line from Dundalk to Ballyshannon)79     Aerodromes should, presumably, be establishedboth in the North and in the neighbourhood of Dublin,xn......
in order that hostile concentration slight he dealt withfrom the air or retaliatory measures taken in ease ofaggressive attack upon the British forces.8e    A cessation of interco\irse with the disaffectedcounties would be proclaimed, and foreign powers wouldbe notified of their effective blockade*9*.     In the preparation of plans to meet the foregoinghypothetical contingencies , the following further points should be taken into account?&quot;(a) The juridical conditions of a conflict betweenthe British Government and an Irish Republic wouldbe, broadly speaking, those between, the UnionGovernment and the Confederated States, that is there would be military recognition for persons in uniform.   They would not be treated as rebels ifthey belonged to the army forces of the Republic^but there would be no recognition on our partcapable of admitting their rights to recognition by other nations.(b) In such hostilities we should enjoy theadvantage of no longer having direct responsibilityfor the welfare of the people of Southern Ireland,but we should have heavy responsibilities torefugeesa   There are 300,000 Unionists living inthe 26 counties whose position might at any timebecome very grave*   Veiled threats have alreadybeen directed against them at recent Republicanmeetings,   They may be compelled to fly to Dublinor the sea.   The aid of the Havy may have to be invoked to remove them from certain points on the&apos; coast.
Co)   In the event of a collision between british forces and the Republican Government, or evenupon the mere establishment of a RepublicanGovernment, serious outrages might take placein this country,,   Against these also precautionary measures must be put in train.Whitehall Gardens, S.W. ,10th.

Very Secret

April 6th 1922.

Sir,

I am commended by the Army Council to inform you that the question as to waht action should be taken by you in the event if a Republic being declared in Ireland has been considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government and I am accordingly to givyou the following instructions:-

(1) If a Republic were declared by some body of persons in some part of Ireland remote from Dublin, there would be time to get information as to the nature and importance of the movement from the Provisional Government and to communicate with the Secretary of State for War before taking any steps - other than any military precautions which the situation called for - which migh aggravate the then political situation and perhaps cause the resignation of the Provisional Government.

(2) If, howerver, a Republic were declared in Dublin, it might not be possible to delay action pending such communication. You are therefore authorised in that event to declare martial law in Dublin immediately.

(3) You are now in process of vacating the Curragh and of bringing the stores and the troops into Dublin. If this movement has not been completed when you are called upon to declare martial law, you are authorised immediately to bring the troops into Dublin from the Curragh. any stores remaining being burnt.

(4) In accordance with your verbal request, the Admiralty have been asked to pout 2 Destroyers in the river at Dublin, and you will make local arrangements necessary with the Admiral for co-operation.

I am Sir.

Your obedient Servant.

APPBIISXJS IIITELEGRAM TO,.SIR PERCY COX.personal and secret my telegram of yesterday.   Treaty.   Matter was considered by cabinet to-day.   I regret that alternative procedure suggestedin your telegram Ho.258 will not meet the difficulty.   We arenot in a position to ask Allies or League of nations to altercharacter of obligations which we have assumed in Iraq.   Feissland Uaqib must give us credit; for understanding international situation better than they do and must accept our assurance that what they want cannot be done.   Position is in effect that we areprepared to assist Iraq state on certain conditions that cannotbe materially modified.    These conditions are set out in draft treaty as approved by H.M.&amp;.     If Iraq will not agree to those terms she must do without our assistance.    The King and his advisers should understand clearly that this is the alternativebefore them.     I hope that before their final decision is reachedboth they and the people of Iraq generally will be made to seequite clearly fcow narrow la the- issue on which they are riskingso much.   There is no difference of substance between what weoffer them and what they arc prepared to accept.   , W9 are insubstantial agreement about operative part of&quot;Treaty, which is what will regulate out future relations with.the Iraq Stateand which places them on the basis, not of mandatory authority,but of an engagement freely entered into between equals,    thatthey are objecting to is not terms of engagement but source fromwhich we derive authority to make any engagement at all.   Theytv.ro in fact criticising our relations not with themselves but with the League of Nations.    I cannot see why they should concern themselves with the latter.    You should put a. 11 these argumentsto Feisal and the liaqlb and make them understand clearly that.I-i.6. are in earnest in their Intention to withdraw supportif abrogation of Mandate is made a condition of its acceptance.drifter further discussion the Cabinet are prepared to &quot;acceptColonial Office alternative of Article V of draft mandate.    Ileave it to you to make best use of this concession, as a leverfor securing agreement on wider question.
1, Carlton House Terrace,S * l:v fitApril 5, 1922.My dear Prime Minister,I see that Churchill is bringing up againthis afternoon the question of whether Faisal should or should not have foreign representation.The Foreign 0ffice propose one formula -The Colonial office another.You will remember that on the last occasionthat we discussed the matter in Cabinet, you, Balfourand I were opposed to granting Feisal&apos;s demand - partly because we did not want another row with the French whowould be furious at a decision which could not but re-acton their position in Syria, and who might be expected to oppose and do their beat to defeat any such modificationof the mandate at the Council of the League - partly because v e did not think that the state of Irak had reached a stage of consolidation to demand or to ieservethe right to appoint diplomatic representatives,partlyo fbecause themultiplie-ation/feueh representatives is becoming a real source of embarrassment to our diplomacy,and may give us a good deal of trouble in the future.Churchill was however authorised to wire toCox as to whether he thought the refusal of this concession would vitally affect French prestige.Cox, as might be expected,  answered in the affirmative.    J3ut meanwhile Feisal objects to the mandatealtogether/-85/2 2/3.   Appendix 4
altogether and wants to sweep it away In toto.This it is generally recognised is impossible.Whether his objections can be overcome bysurrender on the point of diplomatic representation i cannot say.    Personally I doubt it and I at a loth to make concessions which may be very troublesome to us, and whichalmost inevitably lead to a demand for something acre *These are the views which i should have urgedhad i been able to- attend the Cabinet this afternoon..But if you and the Cabinet think that thesituation has changed and that we ought to reverse our previous decision I do not wish - in my absence. - to standin the way, although it is the Foreign office ana not theColonial office who will bo the sufferers by the surrender.For, once Feisal attains his representation,he will not have much more to say to the colonial office.&apos;iis man will sit on the doorstep of toe Foreign Officeand will cause us an amount of diplomatic, trouble whichI regard with the gravest apprehension and dismay.Sr. Churchill has been good enough to relievemo of Feisal.    The last thing I want is to have him backagain IYours sincerely,(Signed)    CUE-SO JS-.You may read..this latter if desired.
