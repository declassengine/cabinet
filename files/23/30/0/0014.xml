and 29tha June 28/ 1922.flAlID. (i) With reference to Conferences of Ministers held on /pjie Capture     the Secretary of State for the Colonies gave the cabinet if the PourCourts, an account of the latest developments in Ireland.   the prolongation of the operations by the Free State troopsagainst the Pour Courts, coupled with the suggestion that had bean put about that the Free State Government was act-ing at the behest of the British Government, had to someextent reacted adversely on public opinion.   The Secretaryof State appealed to any of his colleagues who were makingspeeches to dwell on the fact that they should avoid any suggestion that the Free State Government was acting on british inspiration, and to lay stress on the fact thatthey have undertaken the task on their own initiative.Mr Churchill reported that the greater part of thev.Pour Courts had been captured on tho previous evening andthat 53 prisoners had been, taken. 27 had been killed and72 wounded.10,000 rifles, 4 additional field guns, and otherrequirementsf had been furnished to the Free State forcesat the request of the Free State Government.   At one timeammunition had run short, hut now there were arr.plo supplies.Mr Churchill then read a Proclamation which had beenissued by the Free State Government in reply to the proclamation-mation issued by the Republicans.   This document met withgeneral commendation.Towards the end of the meeting information wasreceived of further developments in the situation.at Dublin,including the burning of and an explosion at the Four Courts.
2 i2 &apos; JlISSIOM OP (s)   The Cabinet had before their; a report of a ConversaTO, LEAGUE       tion hold at 10, Downing Street, on June 31, 1923, inNATIONS .regard to the admission of Germany to the League ofNations .After the Acting Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs had amplified the reasons given in the abovereport in favour of the admission of Germany to theLeague, the Cabinet unanimously agreed -To approve the general policy recommended,which is set forth in the report in thefo11owing t erms:-(a) That it was desirable that Germany shouldbe admitted as a Member of the assembly and of the Council of the League of Nationst(b) That a direct proposal on these lines tothe French. Government was bound to leadto a refusal:(c) That the most-hopeful plan appeared to beto let the French. Government know that wewere generally in favour of the admissionof Germany to the League, without entering into discussions with them on the subject:(d) That the Acting Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should discuss with theBritish Ambassador in Paris, now on a. i      visit to this country, the best manner of approaching the French Government on thesubject:(e) That the Acting Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should authorise theBritish Ambassador in Berlin to encourage the German Government to apply for member-ship of the League of Nations before thenext meeting of the Assembly, and to let the German Government know that the repre-sent at ives of the British Government onthe League would support the admission ofGermany to membership of the Council.
g.m STATES Co) The Cabinet had before them, a Memorandum by theKIP SUBSIDYnil.President of the Board of Trade on the subject of theUnited States Ship Subsidy Bill (Paper G.P.-4032).The President of the Board of Trade made a statement to the Cabinet summarising in detail the proposals eon-tained in the Memorandum.The Cabinet were informed that there was oppositionto the Bill in the United States of America, and that thisopposition would be weakened by any British threat of retaliation.Considerable discussion took place as to what wouldbe the effect of retaliation, and whether it would affect-British or United States shipping the move adversely.Some stress was laid on the fact that the passage of theBill would result in retaliatory measures against Americanshipping being taken in other countries, which measuresmight operate against British shipping.   This would resultin chaos similar to that which existed already in regardto the exchanges.&apos; . The Cabinet agreed  -(a) That any policy of retaliation or threat of retaliation against the United Statesof America should only be embarked uponwith the utmost caution and after exhaust-iye enquiry:(b) That the British Ambassador in Washington(the Right Hon. Sir -Auckland Geddes), whois due to visit this country wit?ain a short time, should be invited to attend a meetingof the Cabinet in order to advise on thequestion:(e) That the President of the Board of trade should be invited to furnish the cabinet with further information regarding the approximate number of British ships call-ing at United States ports, and of United- States ships calling at ports in the BritishEmpire, and also with a rough, estimate ofthe reciprocal damage which would be inflicted on British and American shipping respectivelyby the adoption of a policy of retaliation.
S8EBICAIJ     (4) With, reference to Cabinet 55 (SS), Conclusion 6, the acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read to theCabinet his draft of a despatch, prepared in accordance withthe Conclusion of the Cabinet quoted above, for transmissionto the debtor Powers.Having regard to the importance of covering the wholefield, the suggestion was made that the proposed despatchshould state specifically that the British Government wouldbe prepared to forego Great Britain&apos;s reparation claimsas part of a general scheme for the liquidation of inter-Allied debts, and also that emphasis should be laid in thedespatch on the fact that Great Britain had borrowed herdebt to the United States Government in order that she might be able to lend it to her other Allies.The Cabinet agreed -(a) To approve generally the terms of thedraft despatch to the debtor Powers,subject to the following considerations:-(i) That the draft despatch should contain a statement to the effect that GreatBritain&apos;s debt to the United States \?asincurred for the sole purpose of financing her other Allies:(ii) That the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Secretary of State for war should furnish the Acting Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs withmaterial for a paragraph indicating the willingness of the British Gov-ernment to forego Great Britain&apos;sreparation claims as part of a generalscheme for liquidating inter-allied debts:Secretary of State for Indi(b) That ,the Sapretjary of State for the Colonies and the^shouXo/uafce to consult the Dominionsand India on the policy embodied in thedespatch, and particularly on the proposedreferences to reparations,, with a view toas certaxning their views:(c) That when the despatch was transmitted to the debtor Powers, a copy of it should be sentunofficially to the United States Government.,
9 i-^ILIAN (5) The Cabinet were informed that it was highlyUlBlTION.desirable that, if possible, the British. Navy should be adequately represented at the forthcoming opening of the exhibition at Rio de Janeiro.The Cabinet agreed  -That His Majesty&apos;s Ships &quot;HOOD&quot; and&quot;REPULSE&quot; should be sent to Rio deJaneiro, and that the extra cost of fuel (estimated at  50,000) should becharged against General Savings onMavy &quot;Votes, and should not be&quot;chargedagainst the Fuelling Vote.

The Cabinet were informed that the only unavailable difficulty to be met related to the question of the enfranchisement of women at Cambridge, and that it was proposed in the event of a clause being moved in Committee of the House making it an instruction to the Commission to provide for the admission of women, that the Minister in charge of the Bill should indicate the reasons why the Government desired to leave this matter for the decision of the University, but announcing at the same time that it was not intended to put on the Government Whips.

The Cabinet agreed --

to refer the question of the attitude to be adopted by the Government regarding the enfranchisement of women at Cambridge to the Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the President of the Board of Education for decision.

21. The Chairman drew attention to the large number of bills which were under consideration either in Parliament or beforethe Committee, in addition to various other Bills in preparationin the Departments, and invited the observations of the chief whip on the amount of parliamentary time available for their discussion.Colonel Leslie Wilson stated that between Monday, 19th june and 3rd August there were only twenty-eight full parliamentarydays and four half days. Of these at least eleven nrast be allottedfor Supply and 7 for the remaining stages of the Finance Bill,which would leave not more than ten full days and four halfdays for legislation.   Of the legislation, of which the Whips hadalready had. notice, the most controversial was the Teachers&apos;Superannuation Bill and the Economy Bill.    If the committee stage of the Teachers&apos; Superannuation Bill was taken on the floor of the House, that would occupy two days, and he hoped itwould be possible for it to he sent upstairs.   In addition to that,there were  Supplementary Estimates, the regulations underPart 2 of the Safeguarding of Industries Act, the debate onCattle Embargo, the report stages of several Bills, several minorBills now in the Lords, and various other matters.   The debate on the Summer Time Bill would also occupy some time.   Thiswas apart altogether from debates on Ireland and the proposedloan  to   Northern  Ireland.     He  would,  therefore,  ask  theCommittee not to authorise any further legislation except of aclearly non-contentious character.   With the present programmeit would almost certainly be necessary for the House to sit uptill the 10th or 13th August, unless some of the Bills were dropped.The Chairman drew the attention of the Committee to thedesirabilitjr of passing a Bill setting up a Statutory Commissionto give effect to the recommendation of the Royal Commission inOxford and Cambridge.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour drew attention to the proposed Bill to amend the law relating toTrade Boards, which was about to be considered by a Sub-Committee of the Home Affairs Committee, and would undoubtedly be controversial.The President of the Board of Trade stated that the Boardof Trade had one or two Bills in the House of Lords, and apartfrom that there was a Bill relating to Weights and Measures,which was ready for introduction in the House of Commons, but could, if necessary, be postponed.The Secretary for Scotland stated that the Scottish office were very anxious that the Scottish Allotment Bill should beintroduced in the House of Lords that week, and it was essentialthat it should be passed if the English measure became law.There were certain other Scottish Bills, such as the university of Scotland Bill, but they were non-contentious.The Minister of Health stated that the Milk Bill must be passed that Session in order to prevent the coming into operationof the Milk and Dairies Act of 1915, a measure which would throw heavy expenditure both on the Exchequer and the localauthorities.The Committee agreed That no further legislation of a controversial charactershould be authorised except where it was absolutely necessary for reasons of statutory urgency.parliamentary business.
Milk and Dairies 2. The Committee had under consideration a MemorandumBilL by the Ministry of Health (CP. 4004) covering a draft of a Billto amend &quot; The Milk and Dairies (Consolidation) Act, 1915.&quot;It appeared that the Act referred to must come intooperation not later than the 1st September unless amended by further legislation, and would involve the detailed control of theproduction of milk on farms, throwing an additional burden onthe farmer and causing expense to the County Councils of some three-quarters of a.million pounds per annum on inspectingstaff. It would also entail the issue of a Tuberculosis Orderproviding for the destruction of tuberculous cattle with corn-pensation to the farmers, of which the cost to the Exchequerand to local authorities would amount to nearly , 1,000,000 perannum in a few years&apos; time. It was also&quot; necessary to make provision for the expiry of two Orders issued by the late Ministryof Food relating to adulteration of milk and licences for the saleof certified milk.The Minister of Health stated that in the present financial conditions it was impossible to expect the country to toleratethe universal inspection of farms which would be involved underthe Act of 1915. By way of compromise he therefore presented the clauses of an amending Bill to the following effect: (a.) To suspend operation of the 1915 Act for three years from the 1st September.(&amp;.) To give power to a local authority to refuse to registeror remove from the register any cowkeeper, dairymanor milk seller where such appears to be in theinterests of public health, with the right of appealto a court of summary jurisdiction.(c.) To empower local authorities to issue licences for thesale of certified milk, subject only to a bacterialtest and inspection of cows instead of the presenttuberculin test. This provision would bring theproduction of Grade A milk within the competence ofany decent farmer.[d.) To make it a penal offence knowingly to sell or offer the milk of a cow suffering from tuberculosis of theudder.(e.) To prohibit the addition of colouring matter or water tomilk intended for sale.The Minister of Health continued that it would be im-possible simply to repeal the 1915 Act owing to the greatcontroversy such a proposal would give rise to.The Secretary for Scotland stated that the Scottish Boardof Health were in agreement with the main provisions of theBill. He desired an amendment of the Scottish clause. It was desirable that a tuberculin test should continue in Scotland andthe proposals in the Bill relating to certified milk would beregarded as retrograde. It was also proposed that LocalAuthorities providing milk under the powers of the Defence ofthe Realm Act Regulations should be entitled to continue thesupply.The Minister of Agriculture agreed that simply to repeal the1915 Act would be impossible. All the more progressive farmers were in favour of supplying milk of better quality. It was, how-ever, necessary to proceed slowly in order not to diminish thesupply. He had no objections to the proposals put forward bythe Minister of Health. He suggested that in Clause 2 (i) thepower to a Local Authority to remove from the register shouldbe limited to purveyors and should not extend to cow-keepers ordairymen.
Some discussion took placo on the point whether registra-tion of cow-keepers was not already covered by the Dairies Orderof 1885.The Committee agreed To approve the Draft Bill and to authorise the Minister ofHealth to arrange for its introduction in Parliament,subject to the amendment of the Scottish Clause in the sense desired, by the Secretary for Scotland, the point raised by the Minister of Agriculture on Clause 2 (i) tobe discussed between the Minister of Agriculture andthe Minister of Health.3. The Committee had under consideration a note by theFinancial Secretary to the Treasury (CP. 4015) covering a draftof a Bill to grant money for the purpose of certain local loansout of the local loans fund.To approve the draft Bill and to authorise the FinancialSecretary to the Treasury to introduce it in the Houseof Commons.Solicitors&apos; Bill. 4. The Committee had under consideration the draft of aBill to make further provision with respect to the qualification of persons proposing to become solicitors.The general object of the Bill was to improve the arrange-ments under which a person who desires to qualify as a solicitorshould obtain his education.The Bill had been prepared in close consultation withand largely at the suggestion of the Law Society who strongly supported it.Sir Claude Schuster stated that the Solicitors&apos; ManagingClerks&apos; Association desired to have more safeguards for them-&apos; . selves in the Bill and accordingly their attitude might give riseto some discussion in the House of Commons.The Chairman enquired, having regard to the congestion ofbusiness in Parliament, what degree of urgency attached to themeasure.Sir Claude Schuster stated that the Bill could not beregarded as any more urgent than it had been for some time,but the Law Society were pressing for it.The Committee agreed (1.) To authorise the President of the Board of education to arrange for the introduction of the Solicitors Billin the House of Lords on the understanding that itshould not be proceeded with in the House ofCommons if time did not permit;(2.) That the Solicitor-General should have charge of theBill in the House of Commons.Law Property Bill. 5. The Solicitor-General raised a point in connection with theLaw of Property Bill referred to in his letter to the Chairman(CP. 4005), from which it appeared that in the discussions onthe Law of Property Bill he had provisionally accepted an amendment deleting a provision of the Trade Union Act, 1871,by which a Trades Union is precluded from buying or leasingPublic works loans Bill.
land of a greater extent than one acre.   He desired the authorityof the Home Affairs Committee to confirm this proposal.The Committee agreed To approve the action taken by the Solicitor-General.Exports Credits 6. The Committee had under consideration a MemorandumBill- by the President of the Board of Trade relating to a Bill toamend the Overseas Trade Credits and Insurance Acts 1920-21,in which it was proposed that the date on which the Board ofTrade might enter into an agreement to give guarantees inrespect of business transactions should be deemed to be the date on which the guarantees were given, whether the agreement provided for the giving of guarantees in respect of specifictransactions or for the giving of guarantees generally in respectof transactions up to a specified amount.It appeared that the question had arisen whether the dateof the giving of a guarantee should be the date on which theDepartment gave its sanction or the date on which the trans-action was actually made. The Law Officers had advised thatin the case of a system of general credits the date of the actualtransaction must be the operative date for the purpose of the.Act. Under the provisions of the Acts no fresh guaranteescould be given after the 8th September. An agreement to give guarantees usually covered a period of six months. Consequentlyany transactions taking place after the 8th September would notbe covered although the Department might have agreed to give their guarantee before that date. It was the object of the Billto cure this defect. It was understood that the Treasuryconcurred in the proposal.The Committee agreed To approve the draft Bill and to authorise the President ofthe Board of Trade to arrange for its introduction in, &apos; -     Parliament.Burgh Registers 7. The Committee had under consideration the draft of a(Scotland) Bill. Bill (CP. 4007) to provide for the discontinuance of BurghRegisters of Sasines in Scotland and for the registration of writsin the appropriate division of the general register of Sasinesrelating to land, which writs, under the present practice, are recorded in the burgh registers.The Committee agreed To approve the draft Bill and to authorise the Secretary forScotland to arrange for its introduction in the Houseof Lords on the understanding that it should not be proceeded with in the House of Commons if time wouldnot permit.British Nationality 8. The Committee had under consideration a memorandum and status of Aliens   by the Home Secretary (CP. 4010) covering the draft of a Bill to1 &apos; amend  the British   Nationality  and Status of  Aliens Acts1914-18.It appeared that under the existing law only children of thefirst generation born of British parents in foreign countriesacquired British nationality.    It was proposed in the Bill to
enable British nationality to be maintained through successi^generations by registration of the children at birth by a british consul, and by further registration on attaining the age of 21 ofa declaration that British nationality was being retained. Theconcurrence of all the Dominion Governments had been obtained.There was strong demand for the Bill which was non-controversial.The Committee agreed To approve the draft of the British Nationality Bill, and toauthorise the Home Secretary to introduce it in theHouse, of Commons.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,June 14, 1922.o

(1) The Conference met at short notice to^MARSHAL -,&apos;llSITIlY hlTSQlU discuss a number of&quot; questions arising out of the murderearly in the afternoon,  of Field-Marshal Sir henry wilson.At intervals during the meeting details of thetragedy were received.ISORES OIFUSE PROTECTION.JL4ECH 03?SUSPECTS.(2)  OSS SOME &quot;SECRETARY informed his colleagues -(1) That the measures of Police protection for Cabinet Ministers, which had lately been, withdrawn on the easing of theIrish situation, had be en re-instated;(S) That it had been decided to. close theGalleries of the House&apos;of Commons..THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that protection... should also be given to lord Carson and Captain CharlesCraig, M.P.(3)  GEIIERAIi E0RY:r00D and COLOEEL CHILES,  in replyto questions,  stated that there were about thirtydangerous Irishmen under observation by the police inLondon.      These persons were mainly connected with-the-Irish Self-Determination League, the activities ofwhich were mainly of a propagandist/order and were kept separate from the military activities of the irish republican Army.      It was doubtful,  therefore, whethersearch of these persons and their premises would throwany light on the murder Search they said wouldtheypresent legal difficulties and , / pointed out thatthe persons whose premises were searched could bringan action against the police for entering their pre-mises without authority-. On the other hand, theConference were reminded that if the police had good reasons for suspicion, it v;as unlikely that an action
would be brought and much less that the case would go against the police.During this discussion information from Secret Service sources was communicated bygeneral Horwood and read out to the Conference byMr.Churchill.      This indicated the probability of the renewal ox activity and outrages by the extreme sectionof the I.R.A.The Conference felt that it was vital to follow up Sir Henry Wilson1s murder without a momentTs delay and that no steps should be neglected which might help to clear up the situation.It was therefore agreedThat the police should search thepremises of suspected and dangerouspersons and should effect arrests incase of discovery of weapons or ar-y-thing else specially suspicious.(General KorY/ood and Colonel Childs left tomake, the necessary arrangements for thissearch.)(4) The Secret Service information referred toabove contained a warning as to the danger to Britishrs/\1 A 4 ^ .... ^. 1 I- i - -    - 1-----t     * - -     TN-- I. 1 -*  SOJLCl J.V.-X o    vicuo-iVJ-li^   dUUUU    Xli   XfUUJLO.II.In view of the situation which might be precipitate-tated by the murder of Melcl-Marshal Sir Henry Wilson,the Conference agreedThat the Secretary of State for war should be told that the Prime Ministerand the lord Privy Seal considered that every possible precaution should he ta-kenand that it would be prudent to ocKfineBritish soldiers in Dublin to barracks thesame evening0(The Secretary was instructed to transmit this information, to the Secretary of State for War bytelephonej which he did.The SSCPJETAEY OP STATE FOR VOB drew theon the telephoneSecretary&apos;s attention/to the objections which the

Donnez-lui un Cead Mile Pailte.Ponncz-lui un, bon &quot;pourboireRegarding my accident the misfortune of falling into an unre-connoitred trap was due  (1) to circumstances whichupset original plans - see 110o44 - and (2) to lack of time to recover owing to H.Q. not having sent me address of StaffMeeting 11 days previous ousljr, and hence giving me notice onlyon Saturday previous to the stunt. &apos;    I hope you Jll tell theBoys and particularly those who were with rne - I was coveredlike a rat in a trap.  ^-However on Hie road I put down myhand and drew,      I had an old fashioned gun.     You had to cockit and then fire.      I had only a second.       I thought I wascock-pressed - nothing went off.      I pressed again and again.Meanwhile two Autos were blazing at me at 5.......... yardsaway,      I then saw what was wrong,      I was 1/2 cocked.      Ijust lifted my thumb to cock, and was struck.     My hand wasparalised and thumb lifeless.      The others had to get out and were scattered,      A bullet grazed my neck.     a momentmore and I was done.     A third man was on my right and Ibolted zigzagging.      I put the gun which was damaged in abush in the front garden.      It&apos;s no loss to the Pads.      IcouldnH use it.     By hiding in the fields I dodged motor-byke searching on road home and so not off.      iTo,61 had thew.     He got out and left it.      I am afraid that he was/fuddled
fuddled and no use for quick thought.     Young will took coverfirst instead of clearing.      Then lie bolted, but others had come up and he was done.     He told me had overlooked that tilltoo late.     All of us were quite cheerful.      I didn&apos;t know that Aff was only 17.      He is a good kid.      You will see fromthis that I didn*t fira at all.     He has a good heart, but hisnerve was not ruite quick enough.      I hope he has learntcaution.      T. would have got off but for the Cutters he had.Orders were to clear your house of all stuff and songs etc.when going out.     His slackness meant his ruin.     He was in good spirits, laughing all the time.      Point out the lessons of the accident to the Ladsi      I hope they clonH blame me.There was no preparation of defence with us, but I suppose the solicitor was unable.      The yj.ry were prejudiced or theywou!dnTt have got P. guilty.      I saw several points thatought to have been put up for him and noted them down for the appeal.     He wouldnH have aprjealed but that I made him.He didn&apos;t care 2d.     He sang &quot;Eelljr of Killan!T every day.Tell 44 somebody left a P.C. from me to a friend&quot;of mine namedByrne in a coat in my digs.     He shouldnrt have done,nothing was&apos;found on or about my clothes or room.    A  P.C.lifted  1 or  2 I beleive.      I came here with only two as an escort,  on foot to the station.      I heard was going and sentword.      I suppose the Truce prevented a rescue.      I left the others well and cheerful, but hungry.     However, hereyou get plenty of food DCG.      I got worse after arrest atfirst.      I have had permission to get J. down at my own expense.I am in the  same health as I was. at arrest, but a bitweaker.

Please tell the- lads that if theyoriticiso my methods etc.  I. was really quite unfit physically.My debility caused by my nasal disease used to make my headache - and still does - and I couldnH carry on.      I gotabsent minded, and my energy was sapped.      I meant to resignin any case.      And the slackness of some fellows made myjob more difficult.     Most of the lids were good and worthy of the Porce.&quot;     But a few were washouts.      Only the day before my arrest, when I ought to havo been free to da mywork,  I had to hunt up a,, washout who had deserted and dis-raiss him.     He was Smith Ho, 9.      I   can toll you how-rotten I felt the week I was arrested.      3d I hope &quot;the Ladswill believe that had I been O.E. I would have clone much Ibetter.     However,  I think I can say that I didn*t dobadly and that I left an organised and partly trained unitbehind.     My bike I left at 2, Whitehorse Lane.
