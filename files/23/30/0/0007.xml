THE GEiSOA (l)     With reference to Cabinet 27(22),COIJEEREECE.conclusions 1 and 2, the Prime Ministerthanked his colleagues for the support theyhad given him during the Genoa Conference,and more especially for the resolution of appreciation passed by the Cabinet onMay 16th.     Throughout the Conference hehad been careful to adhere to the policy laid down by the Cabinet.
ipMAN REPA- (2) With reference to Cabinet 21 (22)Conclusion 5, theCabinet had before them the translation of the FrenchGovernmentfs Note dated May 19, 1922 (Paper CP.-3985)together with a Memorandum by the Secretary of State fort*ore!sn Affairs dealing with the attitude of the FrenchGovernment in the event of the failure by Gexwany to meether reparation obligations (Pacer G.P.-S987).THE PRIME MINISTER, in calling attention to theFrench Mote of May 19th, stated that he had deliberatelyrefrained from mixing up the discussion of Reparationswith the negotiations at Genoa.    On hie way bach to Londonhe had had a conversation with Lord Hardinge^ whose view would very probablyix that -the French Government ^xragxxxxxg take military action if Germany is in default on May Slat. .  He had alsoseen Sir John Bradbury, who took the opposite view.   He had therefore arranged that Sir John Bradbury and Lord D*Abernons*en!* he present at the meeting of the Cabinet that dayso that Ministers might have an opportunity of hearingtheir views.   A recent speech by M. Poincare at Strasbnrgwas of a menacing character, which, had it- been made by . Clemenceau, would have had to be taken serious note of?but possibly^ as the speaker was M. poincare, the threatshould be discounted.SIR L. WORTHIHGTOB EVANS explained that the technicalposition was that the Reparation Commission would eitherdeclare Germany to be in voluntary default, in which case there would be ground for French action, or it would not so declare Germany in default.SIR JOHN BRADBURY then entered, and was invited to describe the situation.   He stated that, except as regardsthe cuestion of precautions to he taken against the exportof capital from Gerrcany, he had reached a provisional-2-
agreement with Dr. Hermes.   He believed that the ReparationCommission would accept this agreement, partly because, in -.his opinion, the French Government was anxious that theReparation Commission should accept it.   At present a provisional moratorium had been granted to the GermanGovernment in respect of payments and deliveries in hind6n 31st Mayfor 192S, subject to certain conditions./, the ReparationCommission has to examine the progress made by Germany inthe fulfilment of these conditions, and, if satisfied, theprovisional moratorium would be confirmed.   If, on theother hand, they were dissatisfied, the old schedule ofpayments would come into operation and Germany would begiven fourteen days in which to pay up arrears.    If shefailed to pay up - and in the circumstances she could not possibly pay in the time - Germany would then be declaredin default about the middle of June.     There were three main conditions, the first of them being much the mostimportant;    (l) The a-steps which Germany should take to balance her budget and bring inflation to an end.   Accordingto the original condition, Gerr-any had to pass legislationenabling hor to raise SO milliards, of which 40 milliardswas to be received to fore December next.    Germany saidthis could not be done, and in the provisional agreementwith Dr Hermes the undertaking is to collect 40 milliards -of paper Marks before. December 31st next by means of aforced loan.   On that understanding the Reparation Comrais-sion would be willing to wait for the imposition of furthertaxation in order to see the course of the floating debt.The German Government do not believe they can secure goldpayments except by means of a foreign loan.   In the courseof October Germany will inti-oduco further taxation with aview to balancing her budget, but in the meantime that is
postponed.   The arrangements made with Dr.. Hermes are more precise than those which will appear in the agreement, butin his (Sir John Bradbury&apos;s) view the latter are sufficient-ently precise to bind the German Government.(S) The second condition dealt with the supervision bythe Reparation Commission of Germany&apos;s financial affairs.This matter lias been the subject of recent correspond oncebetween the Reparation Commission and the German Government,and the position reached is such as to sake it possible to regard the question of control as provisionally settled.(.3) The third condition dealt with the control of the flight of capital from Germany, and this, in some ways, wasthe most difficult question of all, and no agreement hadbeen reached upon it.   All competent economists, both in france and outside, are agreed that any practical steps to arrest the flight of capital would be hard to enforce and likely to do more harm than good.SIR L. WORTH IMG TO IT EVANS pointed out that theFrench concurred in this view at Genoa, but with a reserva-tion.SIR JOHN BRADBURY, continuing, said he did not think there would be a break on (3), as it was a point-hardly of sufficient importance to lead to a crisis.   Asked by theSecretary of State for the Colonies to indicate how muchGermany was paying&apos; In the current twelve months, SIR john bradbury replied that she was paying at the rate of,roughly,  8,500,000 per month, but had made larger payments in the earlier months;   so that the total for the year would be about 536,000,000 reckoned at par, or  40,000,000at the current rate of exchange.    In addition, Germany.had undertaken deliveries in kind, to the value of roughly 70,000,000, but this was a political figure.   Even if France could absorb the whole of the goods represented by
this figure (which was not the case) Germany could notdeliver them.   He did not think the payments in kindin the current year could exceed  40,000,000 in value.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER outlined what hethought might be the course of events.     The ReparationCommission had set up a Committee of which Sir RobertKindersley, M. Delacroix, Mr. J.P. Morgan and Dr.Vissering were members, to consider Germany&apos;s capacity to pay and her prospects of securing an internationalloan.   This Committee would report that Germany couldpay a certain amount; Germany would then make an offer.France might conceivably say that the sum offered was insufficient, and at that stage would raise the questionof allied indebtedness and the revision of the schedulepayments.     If matters developed on these lines there   .should not be a serious prospect of a breach with France.THE PRIME MI Hi STER stated that Herr Rathenau&apos;sfigure for the foreign loan was  175,000,000, one-thirdto be raised respectively from France, Germany andthe United States.    This was too optimistic.THE MIHISTER OP HEALTH suggested that it would dependon the security offered to the United States.THE CHANCELLOR  OP THE EXCHEQUER thought  that it wouldnot be possible to raise a loan until the reparationquestion had been settled.SIR JOHN BRADBURY pointed out that the object ofthe provisional settlement which he hoped to concludewas to give time to see if anything would come out ofthe Committee of Financiers.    If they ean give a marketf figure /&apos;
figure consistent with Germany&apos;s capacity to pay and Germany makes an offer of a reasonable amount, it would  be difficult for the Allies to resist, particularly if Great Britain and the United states were willing to adopt a favourable attitude about inter-allied debts. The object to aim at was to convert the reparation liability into a reasonable foreign debt which could be secured on the ? of Germany&apos;s assets. 

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES asked whether the payment of £76,000,000 (£36,000,000 plus (£40,000,000) would, satisfy France.

SIR JOHN BRADBURY replied that France had accepted the moratorium for 1922 and was willing to let Germany borrow in order to meet her payments. In 1923 It would be necessary again to  review the position.
THE SF RETARY OR STATE FOR THE OOLOHIBS said that, inview of our liability to pay  56,000,000 to the UnitedStates of America, the payment of  76,000,000 by the people who began the War and lost it was a moderate penalty.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said he would like Sir John Bradburyto state why Germany was unable to pay more;   why was,her .(She had practically got rid of her internal debt.)capacity so smallShe started at the end of the. War with her soil untouched, with factories which had suffered awar change, her foreign Possessions taken away and hershipping.   Was that sufficient to account, for the collapse?SIR J0H1J BRADBURY repliad that Germany was not a country of very great natural resources.   She had lost her irondeposits with the loss of Lorraine, and she had lost hermerchant marine.   She was, therefore, economically weaker;but, in his opinion, the root of the trouble vras the grossmismanagement of Germany*s public finances.   If tills wereremedied and a proper system of taxation adopted, her   -capacity to pay would, be far greater than at present.   Hethought  150,000,000 per annum would be well within hercapacity; but not in the course of the next three years.In reply to further questions as to the comparative burdenof taxation in Germany and in this country,    Sir John statedthat the tax burden in Germany of  280,000,000 was ridicu-lously low and not comparable to the burden.in this country.On the other hand, it had to bs remembered that the mainburden in Germany was not that of the taxes, but that ofthe depreciated currency.   The inflated currency was as great a burden onthe people as taxation.    The German statis-ticians made out that in proportion to the people&quot;s incomethe burden on the taxpayer in Germany was higher than here;but the truth was that all calculations based on Germany&apos;national income were almost worthless.-7-
LOST) D*ABER?IOK   agreed that tlio management of Sexmnfinances was extraordinarily had, and the only deviceresorted to by them when in difficulty was to print, merepaper,   &quot;She process of inflation was proceeding oo factthat it was most difficult to gauge the Individual*capacity to pay.   Xf, however tbc process were stopped.,it would be followed by a period c$unemployment and socialdiscontent.   But until that was done It would be impossibleto say what the strength, of the patient was.   At presentlie&apos;was living on dopes.   9o secure the maximum payment bys Germany it would be wiser to give her two years in which to recuperate and to put herself on a right basis.   It wouldbe wrong to base our permanent claims on her present pool-tion.THE LO^B PRIVY SEAT: suggested that the question of theamount lent on the first mortgage was not affected by borrowing the third, fourtb or fifth mortgage.SIR JOTM S^AT)BUKY said that it was to explore that point that the Committee of Financiers bad been appointed.SIP. I;, ?*OR?HTSJGTOH WANS pointed cut that the second and subsequent mortgages would be held by the Goverraitenfcs.who could come into the count sy and destroy the securitysupporting the first mortgage.   We bad to limit the powerof the French Government to damage the security for thefirst mortgage,THR jDOpj) PRIVY SEAL urged that it would be an immenseadvantage if we could state a clear policy to the Houseof Commons.   Our repnssentatives from the outset badendeavoured to make the claims on Germany as reasonablymoderate as possible, an?, we had ever since been seeking to alleviate the ecndit-5. ore without at the same time breakingwith the French,   The result was that we were open to attack from both sides.   We were not obtaining much moneyt am we-8-

It was difficult to take a definite line in view of the fact thatthe reason-why Geiaaany caiBst pay is Germany*s own wastefulhandling of her resources, and any figure-swe fixed now wouldhe inadequate as a measure of her paying capacity two yearshence .THE CHANCELLOR OP ^HR RXOID^OJIRR said that.with the exeep-tion of Dr. Ratheiiau, all the Gernan authorities were agreedthat until they reverted to a stable currency matters wouldnot be right,,   but they also said that they could not take\the necessary steps because to do so would In?oak up thepresent Government and lead to revolution.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE CGLOHXES said that we Isadbeen&apos; right in fighting our way clown f%om the high figures which were in mind at the time of the signing of the Treaty,but we had now come&apos;down to an annual payment of about 76,COO,COO, and this was a very different story.   The taleof German woes left him cold, and he wondered how far itmight be Germany&apos;s policy deliberately to deprive us of whatshe could and ought to pay.   Her exports were not very largo,and the Germans did not seem to be worrying much about them or putting forward any great effort to increase them.   Onthe contrary, Germany was kept busily employed not for thepurpose of paying her indemnities by means of exports, as was done hy France in 1870, but for the purpose of eonsimip^tion within Germany.   There was a considerable measure of wealth inside the country, although it was achieved at theexpense of creditors in the country*   If they were forcedto deflate, they would be brought bach to our position, withS,0C0,000 of unemployed,   Xt seemed to him that the position had chang-d entirely since the early days of the Treaty ofVersailles,LORD Dr ABERI10M, in reply to a question, sal d that in his view if a policy of deflation were vigorously pursuedserious domestic trouble would arise.

The PRIME MINISTER reminded the Cabinet that no figure of Germany&apos;s indemnity had been fixed in the Treaty Of Versailles. The figure had been left to be adjusted on the basis of the actual damage done and the capacity of Germany to pay, and power had definitely been given to the Reparation Commission to decide what Germany could pay from time to time. This seemed to have escaped some critics of the Government and he thought it would be desirable to remind the public of what the position really was. The courses seemed open. We could say we wanted a definite sum of money paid at once, or secondly, we could take the line of putting Germany in a position to pay more. In his view £76,000,000 was an inadequate sum, but while he had been against inserting a figure in the Treaty he had all along believed that it would be possible to work up the figure of £300,000,000 when Germany&apos;s prosperity had been restored. If we insisted on Germany balancing her Budget and stopping inflation there would be a terrific collapse. He did not know whether a revolution would follow but it was certain that the payment of the £76,000,000 would cease. On that we could make up our minds. No one, he presumed, wanted a revolution and if one took place it would be very different from the Russian Revolution. The Russians were among the most incompetent people in Europe whereas in some respects the Germans were the most competent. They would run their revolution in ways which would be much more attractive to our people whereas the Russian methods had revolted our people. We wanted a stable Germany and we now had there a very moderate, even timid, Government. He was all for making them pay but he did not agree that they were deliberately restricting exports. Their patriotism would not take them as far as that in his opinion. The danger rather was that they were sending goods abroad and keeping the gold payments for them outside the country. After all they were only exporting at the rate of about 25% of their pre-war figure. It had to be remembered

 
remembered that they had lost some agricultural ar^as (e.g.,in Posen), that the quality of their soil had deteriorated,was no doubt *a point which Lord L^Abernon confirmed)and/that they were eating less.     He had that from Dr. Beneswho told him that the German people were below par.   He was anxious to press the Germans to pay but do not let us in so doing produce a disaster which would shake Europe.     Russia isnow more or less discounted hut Germany was an essential partof the economic organism of Europe and a disaster to her wouldbe immediately and directly reflected in all countries.     he therefore impressed upon the Cabinet the importance of carefullyconsidering the Reparation policy so as to avoid taking steps which would deprive us of all reparations and have disastrous consequences in Europe.
0ffilfi 10BB TMW SEAL pointed out that iftwo years ago orGerrasny had startcd/a year ago to put her house in order, she could have done it &quot;then with lessconvulsion than now.     There was no salvation in her prese/it courses, and if she was not pulled upshe would come to ruin in a limited time,, and herrecovery would he no less difficult than that,of Russia *SIR 30UU BBADBlfKY said that his misgiving wasthat his proposals erred on the side 6f kindness *He was admitting that the deliveries in kind should be out down te half the Cannes figures,and lie was allowing Germany to raise .a forcedloan which could not be- repealed *1&apos;his SECKEfAkY JIT S&apos;i&apos;A&apos;1&apos;S FOB SHE 0 OuOllIiSS saidha-would be satisfied with a payment of  150,000,000per annum-*LOUD BAufoUB said that he was confident thatGermany ought to he pulled up, hut on the snaffleand not on the curb,     the misfortune was thatwe had an Ally who at one and the same time wantedrich wnough toa Germany agfoaraisanKJua pay inderanities, and also aGermany that was ruined *SIR J0H8 BKAUBUKY reminded the Cabinet thatthe whole of his cohere was subject to&apos; Germanyobtaining a reasonable foreign loan-,-   That was thesubject which was being dealt with, by the DelacroixCommittee, and would, he hoped, lead to a comprehensive settlement/- IS -
settlement in the Summer, for if the Committeeindicated what foreign debt would he consistent with Germany1 s credit, then Prance could say thatGermany&apos;s offer was inacceptable on the present basis of inter-allied indebtedness..   That would raise the question of the modification of theinter-allied debts.THE PRIME MINISTER said it was impossible togo to the country as suggested by Mr. Asquithburdened as we were with a national debt of 8,000,00 0,000, and an unemployment figure of, 000,000, and announce that we were going toforgive the debts owing to us by Prance, Italy,Germany and so forth, while at the same time wewere to pay our own debt of  1,000,000,000 to theUnite$ States.    The position would be quite differentif the United States were prepared to forgive usour debts as we forgave those of our debtors.    Hewas all for the &quot;Blacket t&quot; plan (i.e. to say to ourdebtors we will only collect from you the same proportion of your debts to us as the United Statescollects from us).    A suggestion on these lineshad been made to M. Barthou at Genoa, but on his return from Paris he had made no reference .to it.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said the &quot;Blaekett&quot; plan would bring the United States sharply up against their own policy, which was at present to demandpayment from us while refusing to attend international conferences in order not to be drawn into a discussionof inter-allied debts.THE/
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER suggested thattJie Cabinet should approve the general line of thenegotiations which Sir John Bradbury was carryingon.SIR JOHN BRADBURY, in reply to the Prime Minister,said he thought he could guarantee that there wouldbe no trouble on the 31st May.Concl us ion:     The Cabinet agreed:-To give their general approval to thenegotiations that Sir John Bradburyhad been conducting in regard toreparation.
,PACT  5) THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES askedrl PRANCE.whether the fear of losing the Pact with this country could not be used as a lever in dealing with Prance on thesubject of Reparations?THE PRIME MINISTER said lie did not think that M,Poincare put much stress on the conclusion of the Pact.At Boulogne he had. given him an opportunity of discussingit, hut instead he had Insisted on discussing Russia andGenoa, and the Pact had only been mentioned at the end.He co-aid easily have discussed the matter at Boulogne had he so chosen.   In Genoa he (The Prime Minister) was inconstant touch with M. Barthou, who had not made a singlereference to the Pact throughout the whole Conference.
PERPRETATION     (4) SIR. JOHN BRADBURY raised the question of the intsr-1103 REPARA-Mijs SECTION pretation to he placed on paragraph IS of Annex II to theSp&amp;THE TREATYW VERSAILLES.Reparations Section of the Treaty of Versailles, and askedWas it desirable to raise the question on the ReparationCons-id. s s ion?THE LORD PRIVY SEAL summarised the view of theFrench C-overnmsnt as set forth in their Note of May 19th(Paper 0.P.-3985).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES said thatwe ought to indicate that we could not accept the view ofthe French Government.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that up to thepresent we had never refused, after consultation, to enforcesanctions on Germany.   We had taken certain stem steps,for example, in regard to the occupation f certain towns.But if the French took isolated action on the assumptionthat we were not going to act with them, that was equivalentto the breaking up of the Entente, for it meant that in enforcing a particular Treaty one Power took action in defiance of the majority.    In reply to a question, thePrime Minister stated that there was an Alliance with france of Versailles.W&amp;BBlimited to the   Treaty/   Throughout the discussions at Genoa,for example, France and the &quot;Inviting Powers&quot; had been treated as allies.   A very serious situation would arise if the French advanced into the Ruhr.   It was true we couldnot declare war on Prance, but we could dissociate our-selves from her action, and in that policy we might havethe co-operation of the United States of America.   Hesuggested that Sir John Bradbury should meet the Solicitor-General and Sir Cecil Hurst, with a view to discussing thelegal interpretation of paragraph 18,
SIP. JOHN BRADBURY Said that, in view of the fact thatthe question of interpreting paragraph IS might come before him in Ms judicial capacity onrthe Reparation Commission,be did not think he ought to take part in the proposed con-conferenee.   The question he wished Cabinet guidance upon was, -Did they think it desirable to raise the question of theinterpretation of the paragraph on the Reparation Coaaais-sion?THE PRIME? MINISTER thought that it would have been agreat advantage to Sir John Bradbury to hear the views ofthe distinguished jurist, Sir Cecil Hurst, who had framedthe particular clause.   Sir Cecil Hurst had made a verygreat impression at Genoa, and his authority was universallyrecognised there.LORD BALEOUR endorsed the Prime Ministers views of theabilities of Sir Cecil Hurst.THE PRIME MINISTER, continuing, said he did not know what, the etiquette of the position was, but he thought itwould be useful and woiildhot derogate in the least fromhis impartiality if Sir John Bradbury heard the views ofour jurists on the clause.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said it would clearly be an advantage if ou.r representative put our points to Sir John, so thathe should be properly seised, with them.SIR JOHN BRADBURY stated that certain points had beendearly raised by his own legal adviser, and he could give to Sir Cecil Hurst, without giving his own opinion upon them, the memorandum in which they were stated.THE LORD CHANCELLOR resented the language and attitude taken up by Sir John Bradbury towards the Cabinet.SIR JOHN BRADBURY stated that if anything he had saidor implied was wanting in respect to members of the-17-
Government, he apologised and unresarvedly withdrew anysuch observations. If the Lord Chancellor thought thathe could properly enter into an exchange of views withcourse, do so.THE LORD CHANCELLOR stated he thought the proceduremight he that Sir John Bradbury should state the point at issue, listen to the views expressed by the solicitor general and Sir Cecil Hurst, and derive any advantage hecould from them, while expressing no definite or definitiveviexv of his own.SIR JOHN BRADBURY said that, In the light of the advicetendered by the Lord Chancellor, he was entirely satisfiedand prepared to enter Into the proposed cc nferenee.the Solicitor-General and Sir Cecil Hurst, be. would, of
JL rtt;PLY (5) The Cabinet then considered the draft reply preparedfSoiTV&quot;      bv the Foreign Office (Paper CP.-598?) to the French Note&quot;$OH NOTE.(Paper C.P ,-39-85) .THE LORD PRIVY SEAL pointed out that the Foreign Officeseemed to have lest sight of the main issue.   It was not aquestion so much of the Treaty of Versailles as of the pledge- of the French Government given by M, Millerand,   The inter-pretation now put upon the pledge by the French Governmentwas. tantamount to a withdrawal of it.   It was to thisserious development the Foreign office, should address itssreply.SIR EYRE CROWE stated that in the first draft it hadbeen suggested that we should end by a firm protest againstthe breach of the understanding which bad bean arrived at;,that we should point out that in April, 19S0, we had takenstrong action because the French had, in our opinion, brokenthe honourable understanding reached.   Thereupon a pledgebad been given by the French which, in its first form, was unsatisfactory, and eventually it was put explicitly inwriting by M. Millerand.   We were, therefore, entering a formal protest, and for the second time, against the breach of the understanding.   The legal advisers at the ForeignOffice, however, took the view that such an argument hadin fact been forestalled by the argument put forward inthe French Note.   The French Government did not consider themselves debarred from taking separate action by M.
