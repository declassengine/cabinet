(1) With reference to Cabinet 34 (22), Conclusion 6, t.Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries on the subject of the removalof the embargo on Canadian store cattle (Paper CP.-4140)After the Minister of Agriculture had made a state-went in elaboration of his Memorandum., the Cabinet agreed(a) To adopt the general principles adumbratedby the Minister of Agriculture and Fisher-ies, viz., to accept and carry out, inthe spirit and the letter, the decision ofthe two Houses- of Par^^ent JAa,t .jtheembargo should be raised^/ not bnly asregards Canada, but as regards otherDominions as well, subject to such pre-eautions as are essential for the pro-tection of our beasts against disease and for the preservation of the purityof blood:(b) That the Secretary of State for the colonies should send a private telegram to the PrimeMinister of the Dominion of Canada, contain-ing an appreciation of the situation inregard to the raising of the embargo, basedon the Memorandum by the Minister of Agri-culture and Fisheries (Paper G .P.-4140),and. suggesting that the Canadian Governmentshould send representatives either of theCanadian Government or of the agricultural interests, or of both, to this country inSeptember for the purpose of discussing thisquestion with the representatives of the-   Imperial Government.The Secretary of State for the Coloniesundertook to show the telegram,beforedespatch, to the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries.(c) That the Ministers principally concerned, viz.,The Secretary of State for the Colonies,The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,The Secretary for&quot;Scotland, andThe Earl of Ancaster, parliamentary secretary and Deputy Minister of fisheries,should foils an Executive Committee for thepurpose of arranging an agreed Bill and generally for settling all details relatingto this matter.   The Committee should be convened by the Minister of Agriculture and
The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesentered a caveat that, in view of the many difficulties to which agriculturists weresubjected and the fact that their positionwould be worsened by the removal of the embargo, the question of the relief ofrates to the agricultural community wouldhave to be considered in the near future.
mWTED STATES (3) With reference to Cabinet S3 (23), Conclusion 5.SHIP SUBSIDY . *BILL. the Cabinet had before them two Memoranda by the Presidentof the Board of Trade dealing with legislation proposed bythe United States Government, menacing British shippingby the imposition of differential rates, rebates and otherdiscriminatory devices (Papers C .P.-40S2 and CP.-4095).The British Ambassador to the United States (SirAuckland Geddes), invited to express his views, statedthat owing to pressure of business In Congress the bill had been postponed, but the delay would be only temporary,as the President had staked his future on the re-establish-ment of a strong American mercantile marine.   With regard- to the suggestion of the President of the Board of trade that representations should be made to the United StatesGovernment indicating that if they persisted in the policy proposed we should have to consider taking steps for ourown protection, he (Sir Auckland Geddes) had, at the instance of the Foreign Office, spoken informally toMr Hughes on the matter.   Until the results of the forth-coming Flections were known there was not much use inmaking further and more formal representations, but itwould be useful If, in the meantime, American opinion wereenlightened as to the real position, namely,  (a) ThatBritish ports are open to vessels under all flags in alltrades on a footing of absolute equality with, ships underthe British flag, and&apos; that when this policy was adoptedit was on a positive assiirance from the United States thatthey would reciprocate:    the United States had in factthrown open its foreign trade, but kept and.- still keepsfor its own ships its coasting trade:    (b) That we have at hand certain Sections of the Customs Consolidated Act,1853, which are still in force and give the Grown byOrder inGouncil drastic powers of retaliation.
\There was a widespread belief In the United States thatwhile the British Government would complain, no action would in fact be taken.   It was desirable, therefore, that full publicity should be given to the history and presentposition of the case.In the course of the discussion which followed, it waslearned that questions and Answers setting forth these points had been given in the House of Commons on Mondaylast, July -31, 1923, and these were read to the Cabinet.The Cabinet agreed  -That the Acting Secretary of Stats forForeign Affairs should arrange that thegreat es t pos s ible pub lie it y sh ould begiven in the American Press to theseQuestions and Answers,
THE SITUATION (S) The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theIN ANATOLIA,AND       CON-     Secretary of State for War entitled &quot;The Situation inSTANTINOPLEThe GreekMenace.Anatolia&quot;, which dealt also with the position at Gonstan-tinople, and put the following questions:-(i) What action is General Harington to take in case of attack by -(a) The Greeks alone?(b) Greeks and Turks?(c) Turks alone?(ii) Will our Allies whole-heartedly support a defensive action in all three eases ifit becomes necessary?    (Paper CP.-4151,)Attention was drawn to the developments of thesituation which had taken place since the date on whichthe Secretary of State*s Memorandum was circulated, andmore particularly&apos; to the telegrams sent by the ActingSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Lord Balfour).There was general agreement that, notwithstanding one ortwo frontier incidents, including the circulation of greek aircraft over neutral territory occupied by theagainst which, a protest bad been made.Allied forces,/there was a considerable alleviation of thesituation.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed his colleagues that he had supported a proposal by the Acting High Commissioner at Constantinople that theGreek Government should be asked to withdraw their troopsbehind a neutral zone.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the Secretary of State for War shouldbe authorised to instruct General Haringtonthat he should maintain his present attitude and resist any advance on Constantinople,whether byTurks or Greeks:(b) That the action already taken by the ActingSecretary of State for Foreign Affairsadequately met the diplomatic necessities of the situation.
-f. 376TEE BRITISH (4) in the course of the preceding discx-ission thePORGE ATCONSTANTINOPLE. Secretary of State for the Colonies^ as Chairman of theCabinet Committee on Economy in the Fighting Services* .ashed to place on record the importance, on grounds of economy^ of an arrangement which would enable ua to with-draw the British forces from the Constantinople zone, thecost of which was  5,000,000 a year.
(5) The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to an inter-view given by T3r Hughes, Secretary of State to the UnitedStates Government, in which lie had indicated the inability of the United States to take part in the international court of Justice at The Hague unless the United States Gov-ernment were given the right to elect Judges thereon;   andit was suggested that It might be desirable for our Ambassadors-dor to approach Mr Hughes with a view to surmotmting hisof electionobjection by some method/other than that at present inoperation.It was pointed out that at present the election of judges was by the whole Assembly and not by individual countries,and that it was not desirable to put the UnitedStates in a privileged position.    On the other hand, thetechnical difficulty might be got over by allowing theUnited States to give a vote in the Assembly for thisparticular purpose only.1 The Cabinet agreed  -That the Acting Secretary of State for. Foreign Affairs shoaild request theBritish Ambassador at Washington to sound the American Secretary of state on the question of the British Belega-tion proposing to the Assembly at its next meeting that the United StatesGovernment should be given a vote forthe purpose of electing Judges to theInternational Court of Justice.
BRT0ISH REPRE-     (S) With reference to Cabinet 43 (23), Conclusion 6, theSENTATION ON - -THE ASSEMBLY Cabinet further considered the question of the third BritishOF THF LEAGUEOF NATIONS.     representative at the forthcoming meeting of the Assemblyof the League of Nations,After considerable discussion the Cabinet agreed --I  (a) That it was desirable that the thirdrepresentative should be drawn from outside of Government circles, andshould preferably be a representativeof Labour:(b) That any representative must be willingto subordinate his views to those of the delegation as a whole, and to act loyallyas a member of the Delegation;(c) That the President of the Board of education should immediately explain the situation to the Right Hon. G.H. Barnes, M.P., and as certain if he is willing to accept thepost of third representative on these terms.    If Mr Barnes should be unableto accept, the President of the Board ofEducation should approach Colonel JohnWard, M.F., and, failing him, Mr GeorgeRoberts, M.P.:(d) That substitute delegates should be nominated, and that their selectionshould be left to Lord Balfour andMr Fisher, with an expression of opinion by the Cabinet that they would be glad if a woman could be nominated among thesubstitute delegates.
(?) The Secretary of State for the Colonies stated thathe thought it desirable to make a statement as to thepresent situation in Ireland before the Cabinet adjourned for the Recess -   He himself vr&amp;s not dis con raged but ratherencouraged by what had recently been taking place in Ireland.Had the Cabinet been told three months ago that the FreeState Government would be waging war against the rebels,as they were now doing, they would have been surprised.There were a great many difficulties in the relations ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government an! the Free State Government,but these were being dealt with by the Cabinet Committee.The Committee proposed to continue to give all reasonableassistance to the Free State Government, and, in particular,to give them up to 30,000 rifles.   With regard to the posi-tion of the Loyalists, they wore undoubtedly suffering muchinconvenience, but probably not more than were the IrishCatholics .   There was only a small stream of migration fromthe disaffected districts, and the exasperation of thepeople with the Republicans was daily increasing.    Theprogress of the Free state troops was not very rapid, andit might be some weeks yet before the rebels were subdued.With regard to the letter from the Free State Governmentdealing with compensation, of which he had complained(see Conference of Ministers held on July 31, 1932, con-elusion S), this had now been withdrawn and a colourlessanswer substituted.    In the area of the Northern Govex&quot;nmentthe position had sensibly improved;   murders and ineendiar-ism had almost entirely ceased, and a state of quiescenceestablished.    This might be due to the fact that the gunmenwere engaged in the South, and that With their returnthere might be a recrudescence of outrage, but at themoment life in Belfast had almost become normal.    This reuult
had not been secured without heavy expense to the british treasury,   Re thought the Prime Minister of Northern ireland was to be congratulated on the way in which he had weatheredthe storm and on the increasing signs that justice was beingmeted out to Protestants and Catholics equally.The lord Privy Seal asked whether, in view of thefighting in the South and the improvement in the discipline of the Special Constables, it was not possible now, or&quot;shortly, to secure some&apos;economy.   Could not the securityof Ulster be maintained by-a smaller and less costly force?The Secretary of State for the Colonies, in reply,stated that the R.D.O, were not up to strength, that therewere 7,000 WA* Specials whose discipline was rapidly improv-ing, and that there was a &quot;0.1&quot; reserve  - a sort of CivicGtiard   which was not paid and was only &quot;used in case ofemergency.   In addition, there were the &quot;B&quot; Specials, num-bering about 20,000, and not more than about 2,000 of these were employed on any given day.    He had gone into the composition ef the force With the Ulster Cover-muent, andthe chief economy which, had been decided upon had been tobring 7 Battalions from Ulster to this  country, where theywould be available at short notice.The Cabinet took note of the statementof the Secretary of State for theColonies.
IRELASJD. (8) The Cabinet tooh note, with approval, that thoVisit of Viceroy of Ireland, on the advice of the Provisionalthe viceroy to Dublin, Government of Ireland Committee, did not propose toreturn to Dublin until the Autumn,
REASSESSMENT       (9) The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theOF retired pay TO Secretary of State for War dealing with a claim, whichSECRETARIESOP territory-     had repeatedly been pressed in Parliament, that thoseRIAL ARMYASSOCIATIONS. Secretaries of Territorial Army Associations who had beenpermanent Regular Army officers and had retired on retired pay before the War were entitled to re-assessment of theirretired pay as having performed paid military service during the War (Paper G.P.-4066).   The question had twicebeen raised in the House of Lords, when a Resolution infavour of the claim had been agreed to against the advice of the Government representatives.   The Memorandum setforth in detail the arguments against the admission ofthe claim.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State for war should continue to maintain theGovernment&apos;s refusal to entertainthe claim of the Secretaries of.the Territorial Army Associations.-12-
(10) With reference to Gabinet 41 (23), Conclusion 10,the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Lord privy seal dealing with the course of Government business and theintroduction of new Bills (Paper C.P.-4142).The Cabinet agreed  fa) That no new Bills are to be introducedthis Session, either before or afterthe Recess, vrithout direct cabinet approval:(b) That Cabinet approval will only begiven where time is of the essence ofthe legislation:(c) That the foregoing shall not precludea Minister introducing a Bill (otherwiseapproved) where the sole object is tohave the Bill printed and made availablefor public discussion, e,g,, the MentalTreatment Bill:(d) That the First Commissioner of works should proceed with the introduction in the House of Lords of the bill dealing with Lights on Vehicles, on the under-- standing that it was not carried tothe point where it would be sent tothe Commons.
INTERNATIONALLABOUR GON-FERENCE.Draft Contren-tions andRecommendations(ll) The Cabinet agreed  To refer to the Home Affairs Committee,for decision, the questions raised inthe Memoranda of the Minister of Labourand the Secretary of State for. HomeAffairs, dealing with the action to betaken on the Draft Conventions andRecommendations adopted by the Inter-national Labour Conference at itsThird Session held in Geneva in 1921(Papers C .P.-4117 and CP.-4139) .
IJQRRNATIGNAL       (IS) The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theLABOUR CON-FERENGE. Minister of Labour calling attention to the QuestionnaireFourth Session,issued in connection with the Agenda of the next SessionOctober 1922.of the International Labour Conference to be held at Geneva in October, 1922 (Paper C .P.-4145).The Cabinet agreed -To refer the whole subject, for decision,to the following Committee:-The President of the Board of Education(Chairman),The Secretary of State for Home Affairs,The Minister of Labour,,The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,Mr-T o Jones (Secretary),the Committee to meet at the House ofColmons on the following day, FRIDAY,AUGUST 4, 1922.
REPARATIONS (IS) The attention of the Cabinet was called to telegramsK&amp;0 CLEARING-HOUSE PAYMENTS, which the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed to send tothe German and French Governments, in which it was pointedout that His Majesty&apos;s Government regard the payment of reparations and the payments to Allied Clearing Houses asin the same category and to be handled together.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign affairs stated that the telegrams, which had been received late onthe previous evening, had not been sent, and he thought that perhaps, in view of the Conference to be held with M.Poineareon Monday, the Cabinet v/ould agree that it was not necessaryto send them.   Lord Balfour added that the French held, thatthey had a strong juridical ease for regarding the two pay-ments as different and open to quite separate treatment.In their view the Convention of June 10, 1921, which hadbeen concluded by the Allies, could only be modified by theAllies, and until so modified its tex^ms should be strictlyapplied.The Cabinet were informed that the Belgian Governmenthad forwarded a telegram to Germany in the same sense asthat which the Chancellor of the Exchequer had proposed tosend.The Cabinet agreed --To refer tho question of sanding the proposedtelegrams to the Acting Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and the Chancellor of theExchequer.
IMAM KBPARATI02J3,   14,     With reference to the forthcoming conference with M. poincare the Cabinet brieflydiscussed the questisri of reparations.   reference was made to the embarrassing attitude adopted -by the French Government on the Clearing Housequestion,- and the Cabinet were informed that,according to information received from the lateParis correspondent to the &quot;Times&quot;, M. Poinoar^intended, in the event of the German Governmentfailing to give satisfaction, to impose immediately and automatically the following sanctions:-(2)   The seizure of the property ofGerman citizens on the left bankof the Hhineand(2)   The - expulsion of all Germans fromAX aa o e -La rr a.i rie *fhe Cabinet were also informed thatM, poincare^ would bring to London proposals of afar-reaching nature which it was quite certainwould not fee acceptable to the British&apos;Government whose rejection of the proposals would,in the eyes ef certain of VL9 poincare *s supporters,Justify the ?rench Government In taking separate and independent action.The Cabinet were reminded that it would not he possible for Great Britain te take any effective action as regards the expulsion of theGermans from Alsace-Lorraine , hut that theproposed seizure of the property of Germancitizens in German territory ;in the occupation ofFrance, was a different matter.     The view was expressed that if, as seemed provable, M. Poincardwas determined to favour extreme measures it* /would- 1? -
mi the whole be &quot;best to allow the French a freehand so that they jsi$ht le&amp;rn by experience^flkmer&amp;l agreement was expressed with the viewthat unless E* Foineare&quot; substantially modifiedhis present attitude France would have to faoethe oo nee faience e of isolation.
ADMISSION (15)   With reference to Cabinet 38 (22), Conclusion 2,(f) GERMANYTO THE the Cabinet were informed that the German Government wereLEAGUE OFNATIONS. disposed to take a high line regarding the admission ofGermany to the League of Nations and to make admissionsubject to certain favourable conditions.   For GreatBritain to put pressure %vith a view to persuading theGerman Government to apply for admission to the Leaguemight place the British Government in a very embarrassing position,The Cabinet took note of the intentionof the Acting Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to circulate a Meraor-andum to the Cabinet on the question.-19-
GERMAN REPARATIONS. l6.       In connection with the forthcoming DebateFORTHCOMING debate in THE HOUSE OF        in the House of Commons the Cabinet wereCOMMONS.reminded that yesterday&apos;s heavy depreciation ofthe mark was attributed to the publication of the balfour Despatch.     It should, however, beremembered that I, Poincare&quot; had decided on hiscourse of action before the receipt of thisdespateh.The Cabinet agreed:-That in the course of his speechthe Chancellor of the exchequer should remind the House of Cosmonsthat the Committee of Bankers had advised that Germany could pay asubstantial amount if given timeand if the debt were reduced to areasonable figure.     The Chancellorof the Exchequer should also informthe House that the British Governmentunderstood that M. Poincare had certain proposals to make, the natureof which was not known.
PROPOSED (l?) The Gabinst had before them a Memorandum (PaperiiriANfedlSlATIQH    C.F.-41S7) by the Secretary of State for India relative toTO AMEND the criminal PRO- certain proposed legislation in India to amend the criminalCEDURE AFFECT-ING THE procedure affecting the trial of Europeans.   The Cabinettrial&quot;of europeans.      were informed that the Government of India was most anxiousto legislate on lines indicated in the Memorandum as soonas possible.   The proposals had been agx-eed by a Committeein India, and it was felt that legislation on the lines suggested would do much to settle the racial question.Anglo-Indian opinion was less hostile to the proposals than might have been expected,   Particular reference was made tothe proposal to discriminate between British, and Dominionresidents in India by placing the latter on precisely thesame level as native Indians.The view was expressed that the present was a mostinopportune moment to bring up this particular question,and it was not clear what advantage was to be gained byappointing the proposed Cabinet Committee.    In any case it would be necessary to consult the Dominions,  and itwould not be possible to get replies in time for tho indian government to legislate in September.   Owing to the Recessit would not be possible for certain interested cabinet ministers to sit on the proposed Committee,The Cabinet agreed -To appoint the following Committee toexamine the proposals of the Governmentof India contained in Paper G.P.-4137,and to report thereon to the Cabinet:-The Secretary of State for India (Chairman),The Lord Chancellor,The Permanent Under-Secretary for theColonies, representing the Secretaryof State fsfce the Colonies,The Adjutant-General, representing theSecretary of State for War,A representative of the Foreign Office,A representative of the Air Ministry *-SI-
(&quot;18)   The Cabinet were informed that, after furtherconsidering all the aspects of the question, the Committeeof Imperial Defence had reluctantly come to the conclusionthat it would be necessary to Increase the existing HomeDefence Air Force to 500 aeroplanes.   This was the minimumfigure which would be compatible with safety.   The cost will amount to about  8,000,COO per annum, of which 9 00,000 would be obtained by savings on the Air MinistryVote, and the remainder by savings on the War Office and admiralty Votes .   The Cabinet were reminded that thepresent weak position of Great Britain in the air placedus diplomatically at a great disadvantage vis-a-vis theFrench Government.   It was urged that no useful purpose would be served by concealing the GovernmentVs proposals in the matter.The Cabinet were also informed that Viscount Ourzon,M.P., had enquired whether there would be any objectionto the publication by him of the material respecting theContinental air menace which he had laid before theCommittee of Imperial Defences and that the Lord Privy Sealhad agreed to this, in view of the decision taken, with theapproval of the Committee of Imperial Defence, to publica-tion of the material laid before the Committee by theParliamentary Military Committee.   Viscount Curzon had offered to withdraw any particular question if asked by thePrime Minister to do so.The Cabinet agreed  -To approve the recommendations of theCommittee of Imperial Defenee in regardto the strengthening of the Royal AirForce.

With reference to H.A.C., 116th Conclusions, Minute 1, the-ir Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour reminded theCommittee that the Cabinet had sanctioned the publication of a white Paper setting out the changes which it was possible to carry.    .   - out in the administration of the Trade Boards Acts without legisla-tion, and this had been done. There remained the question oflegislation.
