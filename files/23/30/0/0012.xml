If Vj BTRIEVE        Cl)   The Cabinet had a brief discussion in r*pard toHOSALB TRUE.the public agitation on the subject of the reprieve, onthe advice of the Rome Secretary on the ground of insanity,of a man named True who had been sentenced to death for murder,Tbffi w^we Secretary said that he proposed to make astatement in the rcoitse of Commons the same afternoon.The criticisms of his action appeared to be as follows!-(1) He had no business to set up a Oousmltteoo f I r:ve s ti g a t i o n:(ii) He otsght not to have accepted its Report:ftii) That improper influence had been exerted.As regards the first point, he was bound by Statute, which provided that if there is any doubt as to the sanity of aconvicted imirderer, the Hope Secretary must set up aCommittee.   In the True ease, the Judge.,in forwarding his report of the ease, had specially drawn hie attention tothe evidence on the subject of the prisoner&apos;s sanity.^e l*r1 son noc+or bad written to say that True was mad.At the trial, four doctors had testified to his Insanity.An expert, employed by the Prosecution to test the prisoner&quot;s sanity, had declined to give rebutting evidence.Tho question of what was the state of the prisoner&apos;mind at the time of the commission of the crime and/orof the trial, was not material to the action of the HomeSecretary, as the? Statute on which be had acted % and on whichthe expert examination bad been base:?, related only to theoeriod after conviction.   It was a well-established legaldoctrine that a murderer who was found to be mad afterconviction was never bannedsfbs actual inquiry had been conducted by threeeminent alienists, of whom only one (Sir Maurice Craig)could be called a Karley Street specialist.   The Terms of-1-
Reference were;-   To adviaa whether fras was now eertifi-able as a lunatic, or not;   and the Report gave a unani-mcwa answer in the affirmative.With regard to the., third consideration, the HomeOffice had acted precisely as in other eases of convictedmurderers.   frue*3 Solicitor had forwarded a petition inhis favour, but, apart from this. Truefa friends andrelations had made no representation *   There was no justification whatever for the suggestion that the Trueease had been treated - differently from the Jacohy c ace *In the latter case tho usual medical enquiry had beenheld, and the Prison Boater had certified that Jaoohy waeaanw.   In all the circumstances he (the Home Secretary)could have taken no other course than the one which he had adopted.The view was expressed that criticism in the Houseof Commons might take th* line that the Prison Doctor, who reported on the - state of True&apos;s mind after conviction, wasa discredited witness inasmuch as the Jury had not acceptedhis evidence as to True&apos;s sanity prior to and at the trial,and that the words **reasonable- doubt * really implied thatthere must be some distinct deterioration in the mentalcondition of the .prisoner since the verdict cf the Jury.On the ettwr hand, it wae pointer! out that theterms cf the Section wer** perfectly -olsar on this point,and referred only to the-state of the prisoner&apos;s mind atthe time of the Enquiry, irrespective of any other eonsid-orations *It was represented that possibly it might be desir-able for a Select Committee to enquire into the questionof whether, in future eases, the Hense Secretary ought to be bound to rely on the report of the experts.   In thisconnection referor.ee was made to the attempt of the-3-
alienists to extend the doctrine of mental irresponsibilityand, incidentally, to upset tha rule in Macnaughtan&apos;s case,^he lord Chancellor, while seeing no objection toan EnoUlry by a Select Committee into the specific questionof the Home Secretary&apos;s discretion, thought that it wouldbe most unwise to allow such a Committee to report on the highly technical and legal questions involved in Maenaghterf case, and that the rule in that case should only be modifiedif at all, on the highest legal advice.The Cabinet agreed -To approve the line which the HomeSecretary proposed to adopt in theRouse of&quot;Commons respecting tha Truecase .
0AK3Xm       2. With reference to Cabinet 24(22)  Conclusion 3,rjpUSTRIES .- &quot; the Cabinet further considered the Memorandum by theW kLtu    Preaiaent of the Boa^d of Trade (CP.3852) on thesubject of the Report under Part 11 of the safeguarding of Industries Act 1921 of a Committee on fabric glovesand glove materials.The President of the Board of Trade, after drawing attention to the fact that the Committee in question wasa very strong and representative one and that their report was unanimou-s, stated that in consequence of representative-ions made by Sir William Edge, M.P. he had intervieweddeputations from Bolton representing the fine spinning-industry.      There was no doubt that this Lancashireindustry was genuinely under the impression that if a pro-tection duty was imposed on German imported fabric gloves,the Germans would retaliate In some way or other onLancashire yarns.-    In fact the feeling in lancashire wasthat if any use was made of Part ii-of the Act the cotton trade would seriously suffer from retaliatory measures.If the proposed order was not made the result would nodoubt be satisfactory to the free Trade supporters of theGovernment in lancashire and other parts of the country.It was, however, unthinkable that such a policy would inany way satisfy the opposition of the Independent liberalsOn the other hand very important elements would be seriously annoyed, and ?/ould regard the failure to makethe order as a sign of deplorable weakness on the partof the Government.     He was as much convinced as he hadever been that the best policy would be to make the order and enforce it.
1f% p&apos;In support of the policy f&amp; 0...P.3s52, it was urgedthat the fabric glove industry was an industry whichhad flourished during the $sm  and was now threatened with extinction,, largely owing te the advantages which german manufacturers derived at rota the collapsed Germani x change.     the Saimaa manufacturers wore able to sell the goods at a profit in Great Britain below the cost ofproduction of similar articled here.     It was not poaslblfor Geaanany te take retaliatory measures against the ;Lancashire Cotton trade however much she flight threaten to do so.     She argument against putting- on a duty inthe proseat case was really one of general application and if once admitted would he fatal to the whole policyof the Act.     The Government really haA to decide whetha&apos;they proposed to enforce this part of the Act at all, and  -to abandon these provisions alter they had been successfullycarried through Parliament would Mm&amp;mm&amp;if involve theGovernment in diecredit.It was also urged that the foaling in Lancashire onthis particular question was much loss acute than it hadbeen some mouths age, and that failure to t&amp;ske the proposed order would undoubtedly alienate e very considerablenumber of the Conservative and Seriff Reform supporters ofthe Government in that county *On the other hand it was pointed out that the fabricglove industry was s small industry before the Wsr,and atthe present time, and that it would be most unwise to ettemjfcto assist such an industry h  this involved alienating thepolitical sympathies ef a greet staple industry like theCotton trade-     Under the Act the President of the Boardof Trade had a discretion in the matter and this was pre-cisely the kind of case where such discretion should he
exercised. It was also pointed out that Part II of the Bill was regarded with very mixed feelings by both the Free Trade and Tariff Reform supporters of the Government and that the political effect of making the proposed order in Lancashire and Scotland and other parts of the country would be very prejudicial from the Government&apos;s point of view. Part II of the Act was never intended to assist small and struggling industries, but was really designed to preserve the staple trades of the country.

The Cabinet were reminded that when the Key Industries Act was passed there were grave fears that Germany would be able, owing to her collapsed exchange, to flood this country with goods at prices far below the British cast of production. These fears had, however, not as yet materialised, though the position might deteriorate in this respect should there be a trade revival. It was most important, therefore, to maintain the powers granted by the Act. The Cabinet were also reminded of the active propaganda carried on by the Opposition against this measure and it was urged that some energetic steps should be taken to place the Government&apos;s case before the country.

After some further discussion in the course of which the Cabinet were informed that under the Act a Committee of Enquiry could only hear representatives of secondary trades if those trades actually use the articles in question, and that the duty imposed under the Act was additional to any duty exacted under the Reparation Recovery Act, the Cabinet agreed by a majority:- 

to approve the proposal of the President of the Board of Trade that he should make an order under Part II of the Safeguarding of Industries Act 1921 applying in that part of the Act to fabric gloves and glove materials of German manufacture.
(3) With reference to Cabinet 38 (S3), Conclusions 1and 3, tha Cabinet bad under consideration the Report of &apos;the Select Committee on Teachers * Superannuation f paper g.P.-4034) and Memoranda thereon by the President of thePesrd of Education t Papeis C .P.*-4 037 and. 0 .P.-4028).The Prasidant of the Board of Education, afterreminding the Cabinet that the Select Committee, under theChairmanship of Mr A.cland, had- decided by a majority votethat no undertaking, either expressed or implied, wasgiven by the Government that the provisions of the Teachers *Siip^ranrnnrion Act, 1918, should not be altered while tha-Burnham Scales ramainad in force, stated that in hisopinion the Government ware-quite free to p.roceed withthe School Teachers? (superannuation)Bill, and that thaabandonment of that Bill would be regarded as a sign ofgreat weakness .   Ha (Mr Fisher) had seen Sir Jamas Yoxslland bad leathered from biro that the opposition of the teachers to the Government proposals would be substantiallydiminished particularly if an undertaking could be given that no&apos;permanent system of contributory pensions wouldbe imposed&apos;by Statute during tha present Session, and thatthe proposed Pill should be limited to a strictly temporaryperiod of two years.,The Cabinet agreed - (a) ^o approve the suggestion of the Presidentof the Board of Education that the SchoolTeachers&apos; (Superannuation) Bill should be proceeded with this Session:(b) To refer to the Home Affairs Committee theQuestions of detail arising on the bill and specified in Papess C.P.-4037 and 4038respectively.1
llSO LAWS (4) The Cabinet were informed that a suffsestion had been  made to the effect that an Enquiry should be held with a view- to ascertaining whether certain laws whichhave for many years been inserted in the Expiring laws continuance Bill should not be placed permanently on theStatute Book. vThe Cabinet agreedTo request the lord Privy Seal to pakearrangements for an&apos;Enquiry to ascertain whether any laws appearing in the Rxpir-Inc? laws Continuance Pill&quot; can be tmdepermanent *
(5) The Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Paper C.P.-3997) relative to the question of National Expenditure.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet that it would be necessary, having regard to the lapse of time which had occurred, to alter "30th June", in line 6 of page 2 of his Memorandum, to "15th July". In this connection be explained that it would be understood that any Estimates to be furnished by the Departments by 15th July next would be of a provisional and tentative character.

The Secretary of State for the Colonies emphasized the very great importance of getting the Estimates for 1923-24 as early as possible. If these Estimates were not received until the Autumn it would probably be found impossible to effect economies to anything, like the same extent that would be possible if the Estimates were considered before the August adjournment.

The Cabinet agreed --

(a) To approve the proposal of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that two Cabinet Committees should be appointed; one to consider the Fighting Services Estimates for 1923-24, and the other to consider the Civil Service Estimates for 1923-24:

(b) That the above Committees should be constituted as follows :-

FIGHTING SERVICFS COMMITTEE.

The Secretary of state for the Colonies (in the Chair).

The Lord-Chancellor.

The Secretary of State for India.

The President of the Board of Trade.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer (in the Chair).

The Secretary cf State for War.

The Minister of Health.

The First Commissioner of Works.

2.-, .f.y i/(to )   With reference to cabinet- BE (H2) Conclusion 1,the Cabinet had before them a flote by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies covering a letter from the Chairmanof the Sorfolk Executive Oosanittee for Diseases of Animalson the question of the removal of the embargo on CanadianStore Cattle. &apos; (CP., 29 69)and CHABCELLOH OP rllCCHJi^lilSKTUB SECRETARY Of STATE FOR THK G0 0IIBS/J3fcated thatthey were unable to agree to the retention, of the embargoin view of the pledges which had been given by Lord. .:.;rnleand of the Report of the Royal Commission.TEE LORD PRIVY SEAL stated that the Cabinet had already decided that -(1) having regard to the moral shock which itwould give to British farmers end to thedepressed condition of agriculture theGovernment could not this session undertaketo remove the embargo; and(2) if the question came to a vote inParliament voting should be free.He was not clear what fresh decision was now required,TEE SitlCHSTiiRT OS&quot; 8IVTE FOB THE UOLOSJIiSS said that Mr.Meighen, the late Prime Minister of Canada, was pressing for publication of the pledges given during the Conferenceof Imperial Prime Ministers in July 19SI.   Lir neighen was now leader of the Opposition in Canada and it was not desirable, that we should refuse hlra an answer.   To refusepublication would be damaging to us, to agree to publication would no doubt load to a demand for further action.THE LORD PRIVY SK4L suggested there was a loophole in thesuggestion of delay contained in the Report of the RoyalC ommi ssi on.THE klMISTER OP AGRICULTURE reminded the Cabinet that theRoyal Commission had never gone Into the question of cattlefrom countries.other than Canada, although empowered to doso by their terms of reference.    If the embargo, is to be withdrawn it should be withdrawn all round.-  If publication
were decided upon it would become necessary to include the following statement by the Prime Minister:

"The Report has not yet come in. When it comes in it will be our duty to act upon it ......." (E. 32nd Meeting, July  29th, 1921, page 2.)

The Government would then be asked why they had hot brought in a Bill. In publishing papers it would be important to quote the views of the Prime Minister of Australia and also the following from the Report of the Royal Commissions:-

"The true question seems to us to be what the facts really are, while we fully recognise that what the farmers think may be a reason for some delay in taking action if Your Majesty&apos;s Government think that this is desirable". (OMD 1139, page 11)

as well the conclusions.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES suggested that there had been some confusion between the export of live and frozen meat.

THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE said it was possible to import live cattle from Australia, but there were various diseases rampant there.

THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND stated that his Board of Agriculture favoured the removal of the embargo and he should have to speak in that sense.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES said that Canada felt very strongly on the matter and he should feel it necessary to voice the views of the Colonial Office.

The Cabinet agreed -

(a) To request the Secretary of State for Colonies and the Minister of Agriculture to concert a statement for publication based on the Recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Importation of  Store Cattle, and on the Proceedings of the meetings of Prime Ministers of the Empire.

(b) To note the intention of the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Secretary for Scotland to speak in favour of the removal of the embargo when the question came before Parliament.

Hill, Principal.Economy(Miscellaneous)Provisions Bill.EducationalClauses: Englandand Wales.8429]1. The Committee had under consideration the draft Economy(Miscellaneous) Provisions Bill (OP. 3984) and Memoranda thereon by the President of the Board of Education (OP. 3989), the Ministerof Health (CP. 398 L) and the Home Secretary (OP. 3988).(a.) The Committee were informed that Clause 1 of the bill was designed to bring the Education Act, 1921, into operation withcertain exceptions ; to provide expressly for the suspension of certain provisions of that Act; and to legalise under certain conditions the discontinuance of continuation schools in those areas where suchb
2schools at present exist. There would be rio controversy as regardsthe bringing into operation of the Act of 1921. Indeed, this coursemust be adopted as a necessary preliminary to the proposals inClauses 1 to 5 of the Bill.With regard to the reference in subsections (1) and (2) ofCla-use 1 to Section 46 of the 1921 Act, it was pointed out that section 8 (2) of the Education Act, 1918, was not yet in operation ;that no Bye-laws under that subsection authorising the extensionof school age from 14 to 15 were in contemplation, and that any proposals for making such Bye-laws would be vetoed by the Board ofEducation.In these circumstances there was much to be said for omittingthe references to Section 46 in Sections I and 2. On the otherhand, it was urged that the Board of Education might find it usefulnot to possess the powers in question.The Committee agreed To approve Clause 1 of the Bill, subject to the omission in subsection .. 1) of the words &quot; except so much of Section 46as enables Bye-laws to be made requiring the parents ofchildren between the ages of 14 and 15 to cause thosechildren to attend school, and,&quot; also the whole of subsection(2), on the understanding that these particular provisionswill be re-inserted in the Bill at the Committee stage, if thereis strong pressure in favour of the adoption of this course.The Committee approved Clause 2 of the Bill relating to theabolition of the duty of parents to cause children under 6 to attendschool.With regard to Clause 3 of the Bill, which empowers aLocal Education Authority to give directions as to the remuneration of teachers in non-provided schools, the Committee were informedthat this clause was intended to surmount difficulties arising out ofthe decision in the case of Hanson v. Radcliffe District Council, the&apos; . decision in which case had just been affirmed by the Court ofAppeal. Under this decision it was very doubtful whether a LocalEducational Authority had power to require the managers of voluntary Schools to reduce the salaries of teachers, and the objectof the clause was to put the two classes of Provided and voluntary schools on an equality in this respect.The Committee were reminded that opposition to the clausemight be raised on behalf of the Voluntary Schools, and thatat the jDresent time it was highty undesirable to raise any sectarianquestions.On the other hand, it was pointed out that very serious difficulties might arise in 1925, when the present Burnham scale of salaries came up for revision.The Committee agreed That Clause 3 should remain as drafted in the Bill, and that thereasons, financial and otherwise, for its insertion should be explained to the House of Commons. If, however, strong objection was taken in the House, the Government should indicate their willingness to abandon the clause.The Committee approved Clause 4 of the Bill, subject to the omission of the words &quot; and no longer &quot; at the end of Section 3.The Committee also approved Clause 5 of the Bill.Educational (b.) The Secretary for Scotland informed the Committee that clause: Scotland. the provisions of Clause 20 were designed to carry out those recommendations of the Report of the Committee on national expenditure, which had been adopted by the Government. Theclause in question would not, he thought, provoke controversy.

The Committee approved Clauses 6 andobject of which  was to amend the provisionsShipping Acts, limiting the   amount   of feesservices under those Acts.(d.) The Committee approved Clauses 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 of theBill dealing with miscellaneous lee and salary questions.With regard to Clause 11, which empowers the Trustees of theBritish Museum, with the consent- of the Treasury, to make Regu-lations requiring payment for admission to the Museum, theCommittee were informed that the Trustees were doubtful whether any substantial sum of money would be raised by the imposition of fees, and that -they feared that the charge of fees would tend to discourage visitors. On the other hand, it was pointed out that thegeneral practice of similar institutions was to charge a fee, that by so doing the Trustees would obtain fumls for the acquisition ofobjects, and that tiie fact of charging a fee would lead the public toplace a higher value on the Museum than it did at present.(e.) The Committee had under consideration a Memorandumby the Minister of Health (CP. 3981). The Minister of Healthreminded the Committee that the Committee on National Expend i-ture had suggested that the Housing Act; should be amended so asto give him a free hand as regards the sale of houses. The CabinetCommittee presided over by the Lord Privy Seal had recommended in their Reoort (see CP. 3666) that the Cabinet should approve iuprinciple the general policy of the sale of houses as suggested in the interim Report, and should authorise the Minister of Health toproceed as far as possible on the lines of (a.) Removing statutory restrictions on sale ; and(6.) Continuing the present practice of encouraging sales whereverprices ran be obtained which result in a reduction of theState commitment.The Cabinet Committee&apos;s recommendations had been acceptedby the Cabinet (Cabinet 7 (22&apos;, Minute 5).The Minister of Health pointed out that the only effective wayof carrying out the recommendations of the Committee on national expenditure, having regard to the fact that the Local Authoritiesand not the State are the owners of the houses, would be to provide that the Minister of Health should have power to reduce the subsidy in the case of any Local Authority which failed to take steps tosecure such savings as might be, possible by adopting a policy of selling their houses. With this object the following clause had been drafted:  &quot; The Minister may, if it appears to him expedient, require a local authority to make arrangements for the sale of anyhouses forming part of a scheme to the loss on which a contribution is or may be made by him out of moneys providedby Parliament, and, if within a period specified by the minister the local authority fails to make any such arrangements or tosell the houses on such terms and conditions as, having regardto the circumstances of- the case, appear to the Minister tobe reasonable, the Minister may, with the consent of theTreasury, and notwithstanding anything in Section 7 of &apos; TheHousing, Town Planning, &amp;c., Act, 1919/ withhold the whole orany part of any contribution which would otherwise be payable under the said section.&quot;[8429]B 2
Sir Alfred Mond felt, however, that the political objections tosuch a clause were overwhelming, and he could not recommend its inclusion in the Bill. Not only would the clause be highly contentions-tious in the House of Commons, but it would be regarded as a breach of faith by the authorities, and it was difficult to see how in practice it could be brought into operation against the large and importantauthorities if they declined to cany out its provisions.On the other hand, the Committee were reminded by theFinancial Secretary to the Treasury that the draft clause in questionrepresented the only effective method of carrying out the consideredpolicy of the Government respecting the reduction of the heavydeficit on the housing scheme. While it might not be practicable toenforce such a clause against an unwilling authority, yet nevertheless,it might be highly desirable for the Minister to possess the legal powers contemplated by the clause for negotiating purposes, and foruse in the last resort.The Postmaster-General thought that the Government shouldpossess powers such as those under consideration, and doubted whether the opposition to the clause would be as great as bad beensuggested. Without this clause he felt that the Government policyof pressing the sale of houses would have very little red forcebehind it.After various members of the Committee had expressed the viewthat it would be impracticable to carry the proposed clause throughthe House and that it would probably have to he withdrawn, theChairman pointed out that it seemed doubtful whether, when theCabinet had approved the recommendations contained in the reportof the Lord Privy SeaPs Committee, the practical difficulties ofcarrying out this particular policy had been fully realised.The Committee decided To report to the Cabinet that, while, in the general view of theHome Affairs Committee, a clause on the lines of the draftclause would be likely to meet with disfavour in the Houseof Commons, and in all probability could not be carried through the House, nevertheless, inasmuch as very important financial issues were involved, the committee felt bound to leave the question of the inclusion or non-inclusion of the clause in the Bill to the Cabinet for decision.(/.) With reference to Clause 13 of the Bill, the Minister ofHealth informed the Committee that the repeal of the proviso to paragraph (d) of Section 15 (1) of the Housing Act would remove the requirement that it shall be a condition of any sale or lease that thehouses shall not be used by any person having any interest thereinfor the purpose of housing persons in his employment. The repeal of Section 15 (2) would facilitate the sale of surplus land.The Secretary for Scotland informed the Committee that he was prepared to agree to the insertion of a clause repealing the Scottishprovision corresponding to Section 15 (2). The proviso to paragraph(d) did not occur in the Scottish Act, and no similar question there-fore arose in Scotland. He proposed to insert in the Bill a clauseextending the existing power to local authorities under Section 14(1) (c) to sell surplus land, so as to make it cover also leasing andfeuing.The Committee approved Clause 13 of the Bill as drafted.(g.) The Committee approved Clauses 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and21 of the Bill.Slum Improvement (h.) Considerable discussion took place in regard to subsection (1)Schemes. of Clause 22.I -itSale of Houses:Removal of restrictions.
It was explained that this subsection was proposed by theScottish Board of Health in order to obtain clear legal authorityfor an arrangement which the Board desired to make with scottish local Authorities under which slum improvement schemes would becarried out partly by an annual payment by the Board, and partly by a contribution from the rates over and above the four-fifths ofa penny contemplated by the Act of 191 9. At present the legal position was, both in England and Scotland, that in regard to approved slum improvement schemes the State was bound, subjectto certain regulations, to contribute the whole of the annual loss inexcess of the produce of a penny rate (in Scotland a rate of four-fifths of a penny).The State money earmarked for slum improvement schemesbeing in England  200,000 and in Scotland only  30,000, it was urged by the Secretary for Scotland that these sums would be madeto go much further than at present if the Local Authorities were allowed to co-operate financially in excess of the present limitedcontribution from the rates.Surprise was expressed that the results of these provisions ofthe Housing Acts of 1919, following on the Government decision to stop new housing schemes, should thus be. in effect, to prohibit anysubstantial improvement of slum areas, and objection was raised tothe proPosed subsection on the ground that it would oblige theMinister of Health to take similar action in England, although he proposed to achieve the same result by means of private arrange-ments with the Local Authorities by paying the whole deficit, minusthe penny rate. The subsection was also criticised on the groundthat, in effect, it launched a new housing scheme on a new financial basis before the old scheme had been completed. This would involvea declaration of policy for which the present time was not auspicious.Moreover, although under this proposal the State&apos;s money might go further, it would also go faster.On the other hand, it was urged that no new expenditure by the. State was involved, that the effect of the relative provisions of theHousing Acts of 1919 in stopping work on slum improvements had- not been foreseen at the time the Acts had been passed, and that, in, Scotland, at any rate, the insignificant progress in slum improvementwas being daily derided. Moreover, there &quot;was no legal power tomake the private arrangements with Local Authorities suggested bythe Minister of Health, since any ratepayer could, according to thelegal advisers of the Scottish Board of Health, object to a ratebeing levied for this purpose in excess of the term provided for by the Acts of 1919.After considerable discussion the Committee agreed : (1.) That the general feeling of the Committee was in favour ofthe policy embodied in subsection (1) of Clause 22 being-carried out both in Scotland and in England, and that itshould be left to the Minister of Health and the Secretaryfor Scotland to agree a clause or clauses for insertion inthe Bill.(2.) That subsection (3) of Clause i!2 should be approved,subject to a slight modification proposed by the Secretaryfor Scotland.The Secretary for Scotland stated that he proposed to withdrawsubsection (2) of Clause 22 as he felt, upon further consideration,that no sufficient purpose would be served by retaining it.Registration Fees. (i.) The Secretary for Scotland stated that he was prepared towithdraw Clause 23 in view of the fact that the Minister of Healthconsidered it would be embarrassing to him.Lunacy and Mental (j-) It was explained that the intention of Clause 14 was toDeficiency Acts.        enable the Boards of Control  to make provision for inspection of asylums by inspectors, and to repeal the statutory obligation that
Consolidation ofPolice Forces.Use of Police Cellsas Places of detention.inspection should be carried out by Commissioners. At the presenttime there were not sufficient Commissioners to carry out theinspections required by statute. The Scottish Clause 25 proposed togive a discretion to the Board to visit defectives once a year insteadof twice a year as required by the Act of 1.913.The Committee agreed That, in view of difficulties which might be expected in Parlia-ment in any discussion regarding lunacy inspection, these clauses should be deleted from the Bill.(fc.) The Committee then considered the draft clauses putforward by the Home Secretary (CP. 3988) providing for the consolidation of Police Forces, with a view to economy.The Committee were informed that the Prime Minister had seen the Home Secretary&apos;s Memorandum and approved of its proposals.The Secretary for Scotland stated that, while realising that theproposals would excite strong opposition, he proposed to add to theBill clauses dealing similarly with the consolidation of Police Forcesin Scotland.The Committee agreed To approve the insertion in the Bill of the clauses relating to the amalgamation of the Police Forces proposed by the HomeSecretary, and similar clauses relating to Scotland.(I.) The Home Secretary stated that he was desirous of including in the Bill a clause for England similar to Clause 24 relating to scotland, which would enable prisoners in England serving- shortsentences to be confined in police cells for periods up to fourteen days.   At present the statutory limit was four days.The Committee agreed To approve the insertion in the Bill of the clause suggested bythe Home Secretary.Solicitors Bill.2. The Committee agreed That consideration of the Solicitors Bill (CP. 3971) should be deferred until the Solicitor-General could be present.Acquisition ofPrivately-ownedWagons.3. The Committee had before them a Memorandum (CP. 3962)by the Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Transportsuggesting that an authoritative statement should be made that it isnot the intention of the present Government to exercise the power of acquisition of privately-owned wagons contained in the Ministry ofTransport Act. The Memorandum stated that, owing to the financialposition subsequent to the passing of the Ministry of Transport Act,this power had not been exercised, and the enactment of the Rail waysAct, 1921, had altered the general position. A firm of private wagon-builders was now enquiring whether the power still existed orwhether it was likely to be abolished, and it was considered desirablethai; the authoritative statement referred to above should be made.The Committee agreed To approve the proposal made by the Parliamentary Secretaryto the Ministry of Transport that an authoritative statement should be made that it is not the intention of the present government to exercise the power of acquisition of privately-owned railway wagons contained in the Ministry ofTransport Act.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,May 25, 1922.
