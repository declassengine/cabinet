HeHSE OP (4) With reference to Cabinet 39 (ss), Conclusion 2,LORDS RPSO-resolutions. the Cabinet -were informed that the Government Resolutionshad been received by the House of Lords with a completeabsence of enthusiasm.    The debate had produced few, if any,constructive proposals, though, a desire had been revealedin some quarters for a repeal of the Parliament Act,   Therewere also some signs of a rally to the hereditary principle.mThe general debate was to be continued, after which it was hoped that the Resolutions would pass into Committee, and amendments would be moved.The Cabinet were reminded that the government representatives in the House of Lords would require guidance as to their attitude towards amendments.-5-
PROPOSED (5) The Cabinet bad before thera the Reioort of a CommitteeAMALGAMATIONOP ?HE ROYAL on the proposed amalgamation of the Royal Dutch, Shell,DUTCH, SHELL,BURMAR, AND   Burmah, and Anglo-Persian Oil Companies (Paper C.P,-4050).anglo O-PERS IANOIL COMPANIES. The President of the Board of Trade, as Chairman ofthe Committee, gave the Cabinet a review of the recommenda-tions contained in the Report, and. the Committee&apos;s grounds for those recommendations.   In particular, he emphasizedthe fact that the recommendations were based on existing conditions and were open to re-consideration if those con-ditions materially altered.There was some criticism of the policy of government participation in commercial ventures of any kind, and, while- no decision on the main principle of such participation wasreached, it was generally agreed that the present raoment,when the oil market was particularly depressed, was unfavour-able for the disposal of the Covernmenfs holding in theAhglo-Persian Company.   Itw&amp;S pointed out that this holdingrepresented a very much larger sum at the present time than&quot; the Government * s original investments in the Company..&apos;- Some stress was laid on the objections, from thepoint of vie?: of foreign policy, to the British Governmentholding shares in a powerful combine which would compete with the Standard Oil Company.After some further discussion the Cabinet agreed  -To accept the recommendations of the Cora-mi t tee, which.may be summarised as follows:-(a) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should refuse permission to the Anglo-PersianCompany to enter the proposed amalga-ssation,(b) That His Majesty&apos; &amp; Government should retain the existing Government share-holding in the Anglo-Persian Oil company for the present.
e3 Cj &apos;hiTHE IMPERIAL (6) With, refer once to Cabinet 59 (22). Conclusion 4 (b),fOELESS CHAIN.  the Cabinet had a short discussion in regard to the previousThe SingaporeStation. decision that the decision in regard to the Singapore stations should be referred back for re-consideration by the ImperialG ommunications C ommittee.The First.Lord of the Admiralty recalled that thedecision had been taken after he himself and several membersof the Cabinet had -withdrawn in the belief that the meetingted adjourned.   He did not wish to raise the decisions on mainpolicy but only the conclusion in regard to Singapore, which affected the Admiralty.With the consent of the First Lord of the admiralty the Cabinet agreed  That the question of the Singapore wireless station should be re-examined by the imperial communications Committee, on the understand-ing that the Admiralty would te fully repre-sented at the meeting of the Committee inorder that the special Naval aspects of the singapore Wireless Station should be dulyinvestigated.-7-
9 ? 0ti    oDISPOSAL OP (7)    The Cabinet had tinder consideration a MemorandumFIREARMS AM)AMMUNITION,   by the Secretary of State for Home Affairs (Paper C.P.-4088) on the disposal of firearms and ammunition.The Cabinet were reminded of the dangers attending the present arrangements, under which the Disposals board were selling quantities of arms and ammunition which hadbeen transferred to the Board as surplus by the FightingDepartments.   These Departments could not, however, them-selves retain the surplus munitions without incurringheavy expenditure for storage and guarding purposes.While there was general agreement with the viewthat the Disposals Board should not be permitted to sellserviceable munitions, it was urged that the BritishGovernment should retain in hand large stocks of service-able rifles and other munitions to meet possible futureemergencies.The Cabinet agreed.--(a) That the Disposals Board should be instructed to refrain from selling anymore munitions. .whether arms or ammu-nition^piMlBl^Wther instructions:(b) That- the Government establishments con-cerned should be instructed by the Admir-alty, War Office and Air Ministry re spec t-ively, to take steps to break up unservice-able arms and ammunition, whether surplusor not:(c) That serviceable arms and ammunition shouldbe retained:(d) That the Admiralty, War Office and AirMinistry, and the Disposals Boards inconsultation, should prepare and circulate to the Cabinet a Memorandum giving particu-lars of the quantities of war munitionsstill remaining, including, besides small arms, heavy and light guns, machine-guns,tanks, bombs, hand grenades, and ammunitionof all kinds.

1. The Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury(Lieutenant-Colonel Leslie Wilson) attended the meeting in orde.to raise the question of parliamentary business. He explained thatthe Cabinet were most anxious, in view of the autumn session,that Parliament should rise as earry as possible in August. It was,therefore, essential that the Whips should be informed of the bills which must be passed before Parliament rose. He knew of twosuch measures, viz., the Economy Bill and the Railway and canal commission (Consents) Bill, which latter Bill would be consideredby the Committee at their present meeting. As regards the economy Bill, he desired to know when it could be introduced.He also requested that the Committee would inform him of anyother urgent Bills.The Chairman explained that the Economy Bill had alreadybeen drafted, but delay had occurred in regard to a point on housing. It was now thought not necessary to refer this point tothe Cabinet, as had been once suggested, and the proposal was thatthe Minister of Health should discuss the Bill with the Chancellorof the Exchequer, and, if the latter agreed, that the Bill, as passedby the Home Affairs Committee,, should be introduced into theHouse of Commons.The Minister of Healtli (who entered at this point) explained,as regards the Economy Bill, that the Geddes Committee had recommended that the Minister of Health should sell his houses.This he was unable to do, as the houses did not belong to him. a clause had been drafted, on the instructions of the Cabinet, forinsertion in the Bill requiring local authorities to sell houses built by them, but on examination the Home Affairs Committee had decided that this clause was an impossible one. The Minister ofHealth himself was not sure that a panic sale of houses would paythe Government financially, and he had no hope at all that localauthorities would be prepared to sell their houses.Some discussion took place in regard to the other Bills, and itwas stated that while it was not essential that the Universities ofOxford and Cambridge Bill (CP. 4065) should become law beforethe recess, it was very desirable.Reference was also made to the following Bills : -    The Special Constables Bill (CP. 4045);A Bill relating to new contracts between the General PostOffice and the Railway Companies for the carriage of mails, which would shortly be coming forward ;The Industrial Assurance Bill (CP. 4038);Scottish Bills on Land Settlement and the Superannuation of teachers;The Expiring Laws Continuance Bill ;The Canteens Bill ;The Indemnity Bill (see Minute 7). . .       &apos;.After some discussion the Committee agreed as follows :  j. (1.) That Colonel Leslie Wilson should make arrangements forthe introduction of the Economy Bill, as already approved by the Committee, into the House of commons as soon as possible, and that the Treasury should take charge of the Bill ;(2.) That arrangements should be made for the introduction ofthe following Bills with a view to their, passage into law before the recess : .Railway and   Canal  Commission (Consents) Bill(CP. 4081);The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge Bill(CP. 4065);The Expiring Laws Continuance Bill ;
(3.) That the following Bill should stand over until theautumn :-The Industrial Assurance Bill (CP. 4038);(4.) That as regards the other Bills, Departments should be requested to take note of the statement made by theJoint Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury that any measures which must become law before the recess wouldhave to be introduced either this week or early next week.Railway and canal commission(Consents) Bill.2. With reference to H.A.C., 116th Conclusions, Minute 4, andto the immediately preceding minute, the Committee had beforethem a redraft of the Railway and Canal Commission (Consents)Bill (CP. 4081).The Committee were informed that the Attorney-General was satisfied with the modifications which had been made in the Bill as originally drafted, but it was suggested that six months (and notfour) should be the time allowed for the continued * closing ofhighways and the occupation of land under sub-sections (1) and (2)of clause 1. Allusion was also made to a slight drafting amendmentwhich would be required.The Committee agreed-(1.) That sub-sections (1) and (2) of clause 1 of the Bill shouldbe modified by the substitution of the words &quot; six.months &quot; for the words &quot; four months &quot; ;(2.) That with the modifications referred to in (1) and anyfurther drafting amendments that might be necess;irv.the Bill should be introduced immediately, the name ofthe Attorney-General being on the back.Special ConstablesBill.3. The Committee had before them a Memorandum (CP. 4045)by the Home Secretary covering a draft Bill to continue in effect theprovisions of the Special Constables Act, 1914, which enabled special constables to be appointed apart from any immediately apprehendeddisturbances and &quot;regulations to be made by Order in Council fortheir government and control.The Committee agreed-^-To approve the Special Constables Bill (CP. 4045) for introduction into Parliament.Petroleum Bill. 4. The Committee had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary (CP. 4070) covering a Draft Petroleum Bill. Theobject of the Bill was to give effect to recommendations made bythe Committee of Imperial Defence in a Memorandum, dated the16th September, 1921 (278-B), in regard to the Government controlof petroleum storage. - The Bill also made certain other amend-ments in the Petroleum Acts for improving the control overpetroleum storage, which were recommended by a DepartmentalCommittee appointed by the Home Office in 1913.The Committee were informed that the Petroleum Departmentof the Board of Trade had not yet had time to examine the Bill,which had only just been communicated to them. There was nourgent necessity for &quot;the Bill to be passed before the House rose, andthe Committee agreed To postpone consideration of the Petroleum Bill (CP. 4070)for the present.[8610]b %
5. With reference to H.A.C. 95th Conclusions, Minute 1, and minute 1 above, the Committee had before them a Memorandum by th.-aHome Secretary (CP. 4038) regarding the Industrial Assurance Bill.In accordance with the previous decision of the Committee, theBill had been introduced in the House of Lords in August 1921,with the explanation that the Government did not intend to proceedwith the measure in that session, and would consider representa-tions by persons affected before introducing legislation in 1922.Representations had, since that date, been made to the HomeOffice by the companies and societies concerned, and negotiations had been taking place in the last year between representatives ofthe Association of Industrial Assurance and Collecting Societies, andof the Home Secretary. As a result it had been found necessary to omit from the Bill two ver3&apos; contentious provisions, which providedrespectively that the expenses Of management should not exceed40 per cent, of the weekly premiums, plus 25 per cent, of the otherpremimns, and that if a valuation disclosed a surplus in theIndustrial Assurance Fund, it should be a condition of the distributionof the whole or any part thereof, that not less than one half of theamount distributed should be applied to the benefit of the industrial assurance policy-holders. These provisions would have been verybitterly contested, and the Bill had accordingly been redrafted.There was no chance of the Bill passing Parliament before theautumn, but it was essential that it should be continued.It was pointed out that clause 27 of the Bill as redrafted mustbecome law before the recess, since the Courts (Emergency Powers)Act 1914, which was referred to in that clause would come to anend on the 31st August next, it was also suggested that an amend-ment should be made in clause 42 of - the Bill requiring that theimposition of fees should take place subject to the concurrence ofthe Treasury.The Committee agreed (1.) That the provisions of the Courts (Emergency Powers)Act, 1914, which it was necessary to continue in force for the purpose of administering clause 27 of the Bill,should be continued by means of a clause in the Ex-piring Laws Continuance Bill;. (2.) That clause 42 of the Bill should be amended by the insertion of ihe words &quot;subject to the concurrence ofthe Treasury &quot; after the words &quot; to be prescribed and &quot; ;(3.) That the Bill should be approved for introduction in theautumn.G. With reference to H.A.C. 115th Conclusions, Minute 1(p. 4), the Committee wrere informed that a meeting had been held between British shipowners and traders, at which it had been agreedthat it was desirable to introduce the Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill,which the Committee had previously decided to postpone. TheGovernment were committed to legislation, and it was thought thatthe introduction of the Bill would show that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment approved of the principles set forth in it, and that this wouldhave a good effect at the forthcoming meeting of the Maritime LawCommitttee, at which the question of an international agreement was to be discussed.The Committee agreed: To approve the introduction of the Carriage of Goods by SeaBill on the understanding that it was not&apos; intended toproceed with the Bill before the meeting of the MaritimeLaw Committee.
7. With reference to Cabinet 14 (22), Conclusion 3, theCommittee were informed that the House of Lords had decided against the Government in the Wilts United Dairies (Limited)case, regarding the legality of an order made by the FoodController, under which 2d. had been charged for licences to sellmilk outside the South-Western area. The Board of trade had brought an action against the Wilts United Dairies to cover the sums due to them, but the House of: Lords, before whomthe case had. been brought, had decided against the Depart-ment. In a Memorandum dated the 23rd February (CP. 3771), ithad been pointed out that there were many cases of this kindinvolving Departmental levies. The sum affected was about15,000,Q00Z. It was now necessary to decide what action theBoard of Trade would take in regard to distributors otherthan the Wilts United Dairies. This Company was the only onewhich had brought proceedings. It was obviously impossibleto demand payment of sums due to the Board of Trade which were still outstanding, and it was a question whether sums alreadycollected should not be paid back. As regards other Departments,proceedings had been instituted against the Shipping Department.None of these had got as far as trial, but on the question of principlethere was very little to distinguish between the orders under whichthe Shipping Department had acted- and those under which the milkcharges had been made. In anticipation of some such decision ashad now been given by the House of Lords, it had been stated onthe 9th March, in reply to a House of Commons question, that ifjudgment were given by the House of Lords against the Crown, theGovernment would bring in a Bill to rectify the position. Thusnotice had been given of the intention of the Government Therewas a precedent for this in the Indemnity Act, which had been passed after the war to deal with the De Keyser case and the case of importation of prohibited goods. Provisions had been inserted inthis Act barring claims against the Government similar to thosemade by De Keysev, and barring the claimants in Brown&apos;s case.At the same time, it would be very difficult for the Government tointroduce a Bill which, while admitting that the demands for pay-ment from the Wilts United Dairies were illegal, should go on to legalise demands against other companies.The opinion was expressed that the Government must face theposition that, if they proposed to deai with the cases arising out oflevies similar to those made by the Food Controller, legislation would have to be retrospective.The view was expressed that no distinction could be drawn between the Wilts United Dairies and other milk distributors.The Board of Trade would therefore be obliged to refrain from attempting to recover further sums due to them, andthey would also have to restore the fees which had been exactedfrom the milk distributors, but it was urged that an Act should immediately be passed stating that all further similar proceedings were invalid.Reference was made to a question which would be put byLord Strachie on Monday, the 10th July, in the House of Lordsregarding the Wilts United Dairies case. In view of thisquestion it was imperative that the Government should decideupon their course of action within the next few clays. The otherDepartments besides the Food and Shipping Departments of theBoard of Trade which were involved were the Treasury and theMinistry of Agriculture.On the other hand, it was urged that the question was of suchwide dimensions and of such great importance that the most carefulconsideration should be given to it, and that the opinion of the LawOfficers to whom all relative documents should be communicatedought to be taken.
6After considerable discussion the Committee agreed (I.) That the Board of Trade should request Lord StrachivAopostpone his question from next Monday until thefollowing Wednesday, so as to allow the Governmenttime to consider the matter ;(2.) That the Solicitors to the Treasury and the Board of trade should prepare a case for submission to the Law Officersregarding the effect of the decision in the Wilts UnitedDairies case upon levies arising out of government control.(3.) That the opinion of the Law Officers should be reported tothe Committee at their next meeting when the reply toLord Strachie&apos;s question could be considered.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W. 1,July 5, 192;!.o

WITH reference to H.A.C. 116, Conclusion 7, the HonjpAffairs Committee were informed that the Cabinet at the meetingheld that morning had decided that the Bill to amend the rent restrictions Act should not be  introduced  during the present session.The Under-Secretary for Scotland stated that an appeal to theHouse of Lords had been lodged in the Scottish case, and that if theHouse of Lords did not reverse the decision of the First Division ofthe Court of Session legislation would be required, not only in theinterests of house-owners, but also in the interests of the scottish local Authorities. Any Bill on the subject would probably becontentious.The Minister of Health thought that it would be very difficultto introduce legislation pending the report of the new Committeewhich had just been set up. &apos; He objected to a purely Scottish Billon the ground that the introduction of such a Bill would provoke a demand for similar legislation in England.The Committee agreed (1.) That having regard to the decision reached by the Cabinetthat morning (Cabinet 39 (22), Minute 3), the HomeAffairs Committee were not in a position to authorisethe introduction of a Rent Restriction Bill ;(2.) That the Under-Secretary for Scotland should be requestedto make enqturies as to the prospects of the House ofLords giving a decision on the pending appeal beforethe recess.Increase of Kent,&amp;c. (Restrictions)Act.Indemnity Bill. 2. With reference to H.A.C. 117th Conclusions, Minute 7, theCommittee had before them memoranda by the President of theBoard of Trade (CP. 3771 and CP. 4089) and a memorandum bythe Solicitor-General (CP. 4098) on the question of the introductionof legislation to validate all Government levies made during thewar, the validity of which might be called in question owing to theHouse of Lords&apos; decision in the Wilts United Dairies case.In the SoIicitor-GeneraLs memorandum (CP. 4098) it wassuggested that it would be better tactics to include the whole ofthese levies in one Bill for the express purpose of showing theHouse of Commons that a common characteristic runs through the mall, namely, the desire of the Government to mete out equality oftreatment under the regime of control in order to prevent individualsprofiting unduly either in comparison with other members of thesame trade or at the expense of the community as a whole.General agreement was felt with the view that an IndemnityBill was necessary, and the Solicitor-General gave details of a draftBill. Objection was, however, raised to the inclusion of the milkscheme in the Bill on the following grounds : (a.) It would be very difficult to reverse by legislation adecision of the House of Lords.(b.) The Wilts United Dairies Company had stated that, ifsuccessful, they would return to the farmers the sumslevied ; this had roused great expectations amongst the farmers, who would, if disappointed, promote a trouble-some agitation. Moreover, the case&apos; had long been regarded as a test case, and all milk producers in thesouth-west not only those connected with the UnitedDairies Company would expect their money to bereturned.(c.) The levy had in fact been imposed on insufficient grounds,and was removed in September 1919 after it had beenin force only four months.
- (d.) In a reply in the House of Commons on the 30th March,w 1920, Sir J. Wills had been informed that the amount involved was 252.000L, a test case was pending, and no part of the money was in the meantime being spent.This implied that the Government would deal with themoney in accordance with the result of the test case.Considerable discussion took place as to the desirability of including the levies under; the milk scheme in the Bill. It was urged that the intention of the Government to validate these levieshad been clearly expressed in the reply given on the 9th March,1922, to Mr. Locker-Lampson&apos;s question in the House of Commons(see p. 2 of CP. 4-089), and that the Government would be greatlyhamperedvin the Parliamentary debate on the Bill by the exclusion of such levies from the operation of the Bill It was, however,agreed that it would be impossible to validate all schemes, includingthe milk scheme, except the actual case of the Wilts United Dairies.The Committee finally agreed (1.) To approve the introdxiction into Parliament at the earliestpossible date of an Indemnity Bill to validate allschemes under which departmental levies were made,except the milk scheme.(2.) That the draft Bill should be circulated forthwith to theCabinet with a view to its consideration by the HomeAffairs Committee at the earliest opportunity.The Isle of Man 3. The Committee had before them a Note by the Acting(Customs) Bill.        Financial Secretary to the Treasury (CP. 4092) covering the draftIsle of Man (Customs) Bill, 1922.The Committee agreed To approve the draft Bill and to authorise its introduction forthwith in the House of Commons.Post Office Parcels 4. The Committee had  before them a Memorandum by the- Postmaster-General (CP. 4091) covering the draft of a Bill entitled&quot; Post Office Parcels Bill.&quot;The Committee were informed that the Bill was required to confirm an agreement made between the Postmaster-General andthe railway companies, under which the latter would accept 40 percent, of the postage on all rail-borne parcels instead of 55 per cent,prescribed by the Parcels Act, 1882, on condition that thePostmaster-General agreed not to transfer the parcel mails to road transport.The Committee agreed To approve the draft Bill and to authorise its introduction forthwith in the House of Commons on the understanding thatthe Bill should not be proceeded with this Session if found to be controversial.Dangerous Drugs 5. The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum byAct (Amendment) the Home Secretary (CP. 4093) covering the draft of a Bill to amendsections 10 and 13 of the Dangerous Drugs Acts, 1920,&apos; also analternative for clause 2 (i) of the Bill (CP. 4093 a).The Home Secretary informed the Committee that it was most desirable to strengthen the legislation on this subject. The traffic in dangerous drugs was growing, and he was advised that the trafficcould only be suppressed by imposing heavy penalties on those engaged in it, many of whom were very dangerous and undesirablepersons.
The Committee agreed To approve the draft Bill with the substitution of thealternative clause 2 (ij contained in CP. 4093 a for theclause 2 (i) contained in the original BiU and to authorise theintroduction of the Bill into Parliament on the understandingthat the Bill should not be further proceeded with until theautumn session.Naval, Militaryand Air ForceCanteens Bill.6. The Committee had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (CP. 4()9u) covering a draft Bill toauthorise the payment of rebates and distribution of profits arisingfrom canteen trading with His Majesty&apos;s Forces.It was explained to the Committee that the object of the bill was to regularise payments which had been made and which still remained to be made to the United Services Fund. This wasnecessary in view of an opinion of the Law Officers that canteenprofits and the rebates were technically public moneys and couldnot, therefore, be disposed of for any purpose other than &quot;that of thepublic service without the sanction of Parliament.During recent discussions on the Bill the Treasury had suggested amendments which, in the opinion of the Secretary ofState for War, rendered useless the provisions of the Bill in regardto the future. The Secretary of State for War, therefore, desired towithdraw clauses 2 and 3 of the Bill and bring them forward in aseparate Bill after the Recess. It was, however, urgently necessaryin order to legalise past trading to proceed with clause 1 of the Bill.The sums in question which had been left blank in the draft bill would be filled in when the result of an investigation into the accounts by Messrs. Deloitte, Plender, Griffiths and Co. was known.The Secretary of State for War also desired an alteration to bemade in the form of the preamble reciting the various changes inthe conduct of trading, and showing the final result of the liquidation.The Committee agreed To authorise the Secretary of State for War to introduce into parliament, with a view to its passage into law before the recess, a Bill relating to the disposal of sums accruingfrom canteen trading on the lines suggested by him.Measuring Instru-ments Bill.7. The Committee had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (CP. 4018) covering the draftMeasuring Instruments Bill.The Committee agreed To approve the draft Bill and to authorise its introduction into Parliament on the understanding that the further progress of the Bill would be deferred until the autumn session.The Oxford and cambridge BoyalCommission Bill.8. With reference to Cabinet 36 (22), Conclusion 9, the HomeAffairs Committee Were informed by the Chairman that at themeeting of the Cabinet that morning, which he (Mr. Fisher) hadbeen unable to attend, it had been decided that the Oxford and cambridge Royal Commission Bill should stand over until theautumn session. There were, however, two reasons which made It most desirable to proceed wdth this particular Bill at once. TheBill had been accepted by the Hebdomadal Council of the university of Oxford and by the Council of the Senate of the university of Cambridge, and might therefore be regarded as an agreedmeasure.   Moreover, if the Bill could be passed into law forthwith
the Statutory Commissioners under the Bill would be able toundertake very valuable work during the coming long vacation.The Committee agreed That, subject to the consent of the Government Whips being obtained, the Oxford and Cambridge Royal CommissionBill should be added to the list of Bills contained in cabinet 39 (22), Minute 3 (c), being Bills to be proceeded with this session unless found very controversial.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,July 12, 1922. &apos;o
