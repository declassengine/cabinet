THisi GONFSREJ3QR     ( 1) With reference to Cabinet 26 (22)  Conclusion 1AT GilHOA. *the Lord Privy Seal summarised the position reached at Genoa, as shewn in the telegrams.    It was proposedto forward two replies to the Soviet representatives,one dealing with Propaganda, and the other with the project for a further meeting at the Hague in June.oftwo Commissions to be nominated by the Russians and bythe other JSuropean Governments respectively.    TheseCommissions would deal with private and public debtsana with credits, and would report their findings totheir several Governments with whom all decisions would rest.     In the meantime there should be a pact bindingthe Powers to respect existing boundaries, to refrain from attacks on neighbours, and from making separateagreements with Russia.     Germany would not be invitedto send experts to the Hague but the United StatesGovernment was being Invited to participate.    TheFrench and Belgian representatives had intimated thatthey could not associate themselves in any communication to Russians which formed part of a correspondencefrom which they had withdrawn, but they had undertaken to recommend the proposals to their Governments for acceptance.The Cabinet took note of the Lord privy seal&apos;a statement.
BBXME kIMSI&apos;iiR*S   (2) The Cabinet, at the instance of the lordSjSKVICjBS ATG*BQA. Privy Seal, instructed the Acting Secretary to convey to the Prime Minister their profoundadmiration of the courage and resource he haddisplayed at Genoa, their appreciation of the way in which, working within the limits of policy laid down by the Cabinet, he has dominated theproceedings by his great personal gifts, raised the influence and authority of all our represent-,atives and officials, and enhanced the prestige ofthe British Empire among all the nations represented at the Conference.
(3)    1-1* 0,SUliOJiiI&amp; described briefly the Irish,situation to tee Cabinet.   It could not fee described ascritical &quot;but we are witnessing in Ireland a process of rapid social disintegration.   We are confronted with no clear-out issues aaor can we $Joraseefa time whan clear-cut issues will be presented to ttSt   $ha situation10 indetanainata.    In signing the Irish fraaty we thought we ware dealing with the plenipotentiariesof the Irish people *   iiven when serious opposition tothe treaty developed in the Sail we hoped that an itMaedietevote of the Irish people would fee taken which would resultin a substantial majority for the acceptance o  the freaty.$be Ministers of the trovisional Government live far tooumch in the narrow circle of their own associates andlate associates, and they think only of placating theobscure terrorists who spring up one after another allover Ireland. - 3?he opinion of the Irish people and thedesire of this Southern Unionists to help in the Irishsettlement did not weigh, with them as it should, and theyhave hardly given due thought to the essential measureof going to the Irish people for their opinion on therreaty. 2ho position was lamentable.   SJhe election shouldhave taken place six months or three months ago.   Be Valera,feeling that an election would he fatal to his position,extorted daisy from the Provisional Government.   It is nowproposed that the election should be hald on the l6th tee.She policy of delay while it had involved social 8egsners**tion in Ireland&quot; had led to the political strengthening ofthe Provisional Government *   It is doubtful, however, ifthe Provisional Government were capable of making use ofits advantages *   the Government has escaped the
odium of being the instrument of power and authority,and has rather adopted the role of a passive suffererunder the tyranny of the extremist party.   She irish people were in an increasing degree turned against theBebols.   All parties.feel acutely the disorganisationand brigandage throughout the country.   Shay oaplorethe relaxation of respect for law and order and the petty rival tyrannies that have sprung up.   If a freeelection took place now, the Government would probablyobtain a large majority in favour of the Sreaty.   Butthere appears to be little chance of a free election&quot;being held.   She Government are showing no capacity for dealing firmly with the situation.   She forcesof the Pros State had Indeed lately carried on one ortwo -successful operations, although the fights were notbloody.   Shore is really none too much difference between theFree state and Republican parties and there is a generalreluctance to kill one another.We have good reason to complain of our treatment bythe Provisional Government.   We have handed over to themauthority, arms and property, and treated them with gener-osity and patience.   Shey have given the Irish people no chance to express an opinion upon the Sreaty.   Last week,when the Sruee between the two .parties showed signs of breaking down, Lr. Collins has sent hla a message to theeffect that the Provisional Government intended to fight.He had asked that he might be supplied with 10,000 additionalrifles as Weil as guns, mortars and other military equipment to enable the Provisional Government to take action againstthe. rebels.   Ho proposed In the first instance to deal withoutside areas such as Srogheda and Castlebar and to leaveHepublleans in Dublin undisturbed.Mr. Churchill continuing said that he found difficulty in
assenting to further issues of arms on a large scale until fee was satisfied that they would be used  effectively against the Republican party. He considered that the sincerity of the Provisional Government should he put to a test: that they must prove they intended to deal resolutely with disorder in Dublin. If they showed themselves capable of dealing with the situation in Dublin, he would gladly support them and give them all the arms required to enable them to undertake operations on a larger scale in the country districts: but he could not acquien?ce in their sending expeditions  into the country districts and continuing to parley with the rebels in Dublin. He thought there was a serious danger of O&apos;Connor beginning to kidnap and ? British officers in Dublin with the object of compelling the intervention of the British Army. If he could provoke a collision with the British troops, Collin&apos;s supporters, it was believed, would fall away from the Free State, and the Republican? Army would probably unite in opposition to the British troops. He understood that it was thought probable that the trace between Regulars and Irregulars would break down, but if a pact were made it was necessary to consider what sort of a pact it would be. The concessions that had been made by the Provisional Government to Republicans and open opponents to the Treaty made their arrangements depart further and further from the basis of the Treaty.  He understood that the Provisional Government had entertained the idea that "an agreed election" should be held. That was to say that there would be no electoral contests  but that the De Valera party would be allotted say 40 seats end the Provisional Government 80 seats.
He had written to Mr. Collins last night regardingthis Eeport and had pointed out to him that such an election would he .received with world-wide ridiculeend reprobation.   It mnlQ be an outrage en democratic.principles for a small and irresponsible body in dublin to take away tv&amp;m the Irish people their right of deciding m to their own future forsa p$Oevernment. He had esspresaed a hope that Mr. Collinswould eneble him to deny in Parliament that sucha step was eonte&amp;plated.
That was the danger of on agreement between theFree State Government and the Republicans.   What would happen in the event of a breach between them?   We mustput it to the Provisional Government that tbey must take .effective action to meet the republican challenge to their authority.    Re proposed that they should be invited tocome over to London, and that we should unfold to thorn theserious griefs we have at the way the situation is developing and explain to them that no large issue ofarms can be made until the situation in Dublin has been cleared tip.    Of course if they required a trench mortarto enable them to reduce the Four Courts or the KildareStreet Club they should have them, but no large issue ofarms should bo made until they have shown that they intend to deal resolutely with the rebels.      If theProvisional Government were not sincere and we continuedto supply them with arms, and the situation got worse,the operation of reasserting ourselves In Ireland wouldbe much more serious and &amp; much more bloody one that itotherwise night have been.    At the same time if furtherissues of arms are made in Southern Ireland, further issueswould aleto have to be made to Ulster so as to keep themwell ahead.    He had been much concerned to learn thatGeneral Kaoready had recently lost confidence in theinlention of the Provisional Government to act.   ,Recruitingin the Pree State Array is only open to members of theIrish Republican Army, although it was in theory an anti-republican body.    right-Servioe men were not- officiallyallowed to join the Army or to occupy important positions in it.
Evacuation of Cork.

Refugees from S. Ireland.

MR. CHURCHILL informed the Cabinet that it had been decided that Cork should be evacuated to-day, and that the troops from Cork (four battalions) should be transferred to Ulster. This measure would reassure the Ulster Government. General Macready is of opinion that the increase of the troops in Ulster would strengthen the De  Valera faction, but it was not possible to take that factor into consideration. A further point was that the disorder prevailing throughout the country districts was producing a flow of refugees to England. The flow at present was not large in volume, but if the situation became worse and  murders became frequent there might, be a large stream of refugees to this country, which would have an important political effect in England. He thought that it might ultimately be necessary to establish a pale round Dublin and to make camps in it for the accommodation of the refugees.

The Constitution of the Free State.

The constitution was now being drafted. He was informed that good progress was being made with it, and that it would probably be shown to him in private next week. He understood that the constitution was very democratic in form.

THE LORD CHANCELLOR pointed out that the situation in regard to the constitution was very difficult. To draft a constitution interpreting accurately the terms of the Treaty was d most complex task, and he was doubtful if the legal advisers of the Free State Government would be capable of accomplishing it. Assuming that the draft constitution would not be before the British Government much before the and of May, and that the election would be held on the 16th June, not much more than a fortnight would he left for His Majesty&apos;s a Government and Parliament to

?to
to accomplish the most formidable task of studying theconstitution, and ensuring that any contraventions of theTreaty were adjusted.MR. OHAMBERLA IN stated that the Free State Governmenthad been informed that the constitution must be in accordancewith the terms of the Treaty and that we must insist uponcompliance with the conditions.LORD FITZALAN expressed the opinion that the ProvisionalGovernment would attempt to rush His Majesty8a Government, and give them little time to examine the situation.     He understoodthat they wanted to diminish the power of the King9s representa-tive.     It must be remembered that they were republicans insentiment, and that probably the constitution would contain manyprovisions that His Majesty,s Government were unable to accept.m* CHAMBERLAIN explained that while the constitution would have to be confirmed by an Act of Parliament, that Actwould not be passed until after the Election and it had therefore been arranged that we should satisfy ourselves as to the constitu-tion before the   election so as to prevent our having to disavowit after the Election.MR. CHURCHILL stated that he had most strongly warned Mr.Collins not to take a final decision on the constitution, still less to publish it, until we had seen it.     It must be rememberedthat the drafting of the constitution was the business of theIrish Free State, and it concerned His Majesty&apos;s Government onlyin so far as it was in conflict with the Treaty or with the pledge given to the Southern Unionists.     He reminded the Cabinet thatthe lives of the members of the Provisional Government were in danger.     They were faced with every kind of difficulty and hewaa anxious not to put upon them more than they could bear.His advice to the Cabinet was that as soon as the question ofthe/
the truce with the Republican Party had been e ettled theFree State representatives should be Invited to come overto this country.     IS there was a breach we should make sure that there would be a real fight with the Republicans,while if the Truce was continued we should see that it wasnot on a republican basis.     He did not think it would bepossible for the members of the Provisional Government tocome over to this country until nest week.MR, CHAMBERLAIN said that there were two further points in regard to which he would be glad if Mr. Churchillcould give the Cabinet some Information.     These were theposition on the Ulster boundary, and the question of theIf TENTION troops in Dublin.     Hq was anxious lest incidents shouldfooF^W&quot; occur in Dublin.     It was not improbable that the rebelswould try to embroil us by kidnapping end murderingBritish Officers.     Ho put the question as to whether It* the was necessary in view of the danger to retain/troopsin Dublin.MR, CHmRCHILL was strongly of opinion that thetroops should not be removed from Dublin.     He believed thatif the troops were removed, a Republic would very likelysoon be proclaimed.     General Macready has no doubt of his ability to maintain his position in Dublin If our authoritywere challenged.     Ho thought withdrawal from Dublin at this juncture would be fatal.     Dublin was the English capital of Ireland.     If Ireland fell Into a state of anarchy, weshould have to re-establish a pale again round Dublinprior to reconquest.     As regards the Ulster Border thesituation was now quieter.     He was endeavouring to securethe/
the amalgamation of the Border Liaison Coramissions,    he understood       Collins was ao* yr^avouratole to the project.    ^he four battalions going to Ulster fromCork would help to reassure the people in Ulster.SOSE) FIT3ALAN expressed Ms general agreementwith Sr. Churchill s description of the situation, touthe toeliovsd. that the process of Regeneration was muchmore extensive then Bad he en suggested by hira.    A freeelectlonwas necessary to clear the situation.    He was convinced that an election would lead to an overwhelming majority in favour of the Free States    The Church wagnow solid in support of the Free State, sad the recentmanifesto issued hy the Church in favour of the FreeState was all to the good although the Churches influenceat the present time was not very strong.In reply to a suggestion hy Lord Crawford that weshould pross the Vatican to use its Influence in favourof the Free State, LORP FiT&amp;fcSAN expressed the opin&amp;onthat it is undesirable to approach Home on the subject.It &quot;is undo sir stole that Rome should intervene at thepresent time.LOW BlRZBmmiT) feared from information &quot;*hich had reached him that the deterioration was so rapid that theelection Might not take place in time to arrest it.In reply to an enquiry from MT* Chamberlain as tothe action of the Transport Workers, %1R. CHURCHILL statedthat the labour party had not been unhelpful.    They hadbeen wording for peace, tout there was soree Sovietisnemoog them.    He regretted to observe that Larkin had beenliberated on bail in America.    He thought it probablethat he would escheat his ball and go to Ireland, wherehis presence would have a most unfortunate effect.In ewmsiug up the discussion, SFU OHAMBSRLAIH state- 11 - that/
that it w&amp;a necessary to await the result of to-morrow&apos;emeeting&apos; hat wean the members of the iro visional Governmentand the Republicans.   After -that the members of theProvisional Government could be pressed to come over-hereto discuss the situation^    He hoped that it might bepossible for them to come over next week when the PrimeMinister would probably have returned from Genoa.   he expressed the earnest- hope of the Cabinet that Mr.Churchill,who owing to indisposition contemplated leaving the country on a brief holiday, would return to London in order to be present at the meeting with the Provisional Government asthe whole of the negotiations with the Provisional Covern-reassessment  had been placed in his hands, and he had an intimate knowledge of the details of the situation..TPS ACTING SECRETARY was instructed to forward the.above Minute to the Prime Minister at Genoa.
4*       The Cabinet were informed that opposition tothe Teachers Superannuation Bill was tending tocrystallise in the direction of the postponement ofany action until the Keport of the DepartmentalCommittee was available.     The Departmental committee might take many months to report, and would have tohave due regard to the recommendations of Lord. Has ton.-&apos;Committee on the percentage grants system, in view ofthe fact that the question of teachers&apos; pensions wasconnected with the question of the method by which government assistance for Local Authorities would infuture be given.The Cabinet were reminded that the TeachersSuperannuation Bill was a rough and.ready methodof obtaining the saving of  2,000,000 in 1922-23,and that it had never been Intended to regard itas a permanent solution of the superannuationquestion.The Cabinet agreed  That proposals to postpone theoperation of the Teachers Super-annuation Bill should be opposedon the ground that it is imperativeto secure the saving of  2,000,000in the current financial year, butthat an undertaking should, however,be given that due regard should bepaid to the recommendations containedin the Keport of the DepartmentalCommittee,  and. reference : would alsobe made to the fact that whereas theCommittee on national Expenditurehad recommended economies on education in England, Scotland, and Wales amount-ing to  18,000,000, the Governmentonly proposed, economies of  6,000,000,inclusive of the superannuation pro-posals.     The difference, namely, 12,000,000 was almost entirelyrepresented by nurabers and salaries of teachers, and the decision respect-ing the exclusion of children undersix.
^iF13We8&amp; OF 5.       The Cabinet were informed that the LondonCOHTIMUATIQilSCHOOLS. County Council were about to approach the Boardof Education with a reouost to be released fromdaytheir statutory obligation to provide/continuationSchools.In the ease of the London County Council andtwo or three other authorities where the appointeesday had been fixed,  the Authorities were under an obligation to provide these Schools, and it was open to any parent to enforce the law by civilprocess.     The London County Council were not infact compelling children to attend, and the Boardof Education had so far refrained from putting any pressure on the Council respecting such attendance.The Cabinet agreed -That the necessary legislation should foe obtained for relievingthose Authorities which are atpresent under statutory obliga-Day/      tion to provide/ContinuationSchools for children in their areas.
o 6f-- ROYAL IRISHC 0$ S TABULARYCOMPENSATION.6.       The attention of the Cabinet was Galled tothe debate in the House of Lords on the royal irish Constabulary Compensation Bill, and it wassuggested that steps should  be taken to draft theterms of the financial resolution in such a manner as to enable the Government, should this be necess-ary, to increase the compensation payable incertain cases, to Which special reference had beenmade in the House of Lords.The Cabinet agreed -To draw the attention of theIrish Committee to the specific points raised in the House ofLords, with a view to thosepoints being dealt with by theCommittee before the terms ofthe financial resolution were actually drafted.
IQUSB OF LORDS       7.        &apos;fhe Cabinet were informed that the ChairmanREFORM.of the House of Lords Reform Committee (Lord Curzon)had submitted his draft resolutionson the subjectof the reform of the House of Lords to the PrimeMinister and that, subject to one or two outstanding questions, the latter was in general agreement withthe resolution^*
