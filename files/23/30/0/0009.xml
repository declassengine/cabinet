tap SITUATION With reference to Cabinet SO (22), 0one To sion 3,.THE FRINIE MINISTER reported that a serious situation had arisen with respect to Ireland, which called for animmediate decision.   Before the Cabinet separated for theWhitsuntide holiday he felt it essential that those&quot;left behind should know the general view of their colleagues on the latest developments of the Irish question.The draft Constitution communicated by the Irishrepresentatives on May 37th, THE PRIME MINISTER continued,was purely republican in character and but thinly veiled.It did not comply with, the Treaty in substance or in form.CanadianHe reminded the Cabinet that the provisions of the/Gonsti-tution prescribing the relations between Canada and GreatBritain had originally been taken as a model to govern therelations between Ireland and the Empire.   At first theIrish representatives had resisted this, but eventuallythey had accepted.   How they had gone back on their accept-ance.   Originally the Irish representatives had desiredan association with the British Empire, with the Crown asa sort of link.   The British Government had refused this and had insisted that the Crown must have the same positionin the Qonstitution of Ireland as In the Constitution of theBritish Dominions.   The position of the Crown was not easy to define even in Great Britain, but it was a fact, and agreater potential force, if he might employ such a term,arrangementsthan any other in the every-day u 4&amp;&amp;sr&amp; for the government/ &quot; .of the country.   In Canada the Governor-General acted onthe advice of his Ministers, but everything was done onthe authority of the Crown, which was the fount and source of all authority.   This the Irish representatives would not accept.   In.their draft Constitution the position of therepresentative of the Grown was reduced to that of a sort
of Commissioner.   This was the first point in which their constitution failed to stand the test.The second test was in regard to the conclusion of treaties with foreign Powers. &apos; This was a question whichhad been discussed at great length at the last ImperialConference.   Before the Tar, all Treaties had been eon-eluded by the British Government, and the remainder of theEmpire had not been constilted.    Since the War, however, ithad been agreed to consult the other parts of the Empireand not to take any decision affecting them without their consent.   It had been understood, however, that whenagreement was reached, the machinery of the Foreign office should be used for concluding Treaties.    The Irish now-claimed a right to make their own Treaties.The third test related to the Judicial Committee ofthe Privy Council.   This was a very important matter, asquestions would arise between Southern Ireland and Ulsterand between the Government and the minorities, and so forth,just&quot; as they did in Canada in regard to the position of theFrench.   In the Constitution submitted by the Irish, theIrish Supreme Court was the final Court of Appeal and theCommittee of the Privy Council was definitely excluded.The fourth test was that the oath was omitted altogether from their draft Constitution.   It enabled them, if they wished, to alter the Treaty.The fifth point arose in connection with the provision in the Treaty that when the Provisional Government wasappointed all the Ministers would have to declare inwriting their adhesion to the Treaty.    Under the pactconcluded with the Party of Do Valera, however,  the latter would have the right to appoint four Ministers,   The Irishrepresentatives would not say whether these four ministers would be willing to take the Oath.   If they were not, then
that would be a breach of the Treaty.The sixth point was that the draft Constitution did not recognise the position of Ulster.   THE PRIME MINISTERadmitted, however, that this point differed from the othersand was not so clearly a breach of the Treaty.   In reply tothe Minister of Education, he said that the writs would notrun in the name of the Grown, and that the Grown was notthe source and fountain of authority.Continuing, THE PRIME MINISTER said that the constitution as submitted by the Irish representatives was not based onthe Monarchical principle, and did not bring Ireland inside the British Empire.   The King was not part of the Legisla-ture.   He would not appoint the Ministers, nor would besnraraon or dissolve Parliament.As the Colonial Secretaiy^ in his brilliant Speech inthe House of Commons on the previous day (to which he felt sure the whole Cabinet would pay a tribute) had said, theIrish representatives had emphatically declared that theydid adhere to the Treaty.   The Lord Chief Justice, however,who had been conferring \cith them for two days, had comebach with a somewhat dismal story of their attitude in thisrespect. ,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said he thought the Cabinet ought toknow why the Irish draft Constitution had not been circulated.The British. Signatories of the Treaty had proceeded on theassumption that the draft Constitution was the negation ofthe Treaty.   They had felt, however, thatif the Irish, wereto be induced to amend the Constitution and bring it into line with the Treaty, as at first they seemed inclined todo, it was vital to preserve secrecy.   It would have put them in an impossible position if it leaked out that theyhad come over with one Constitution and gone back to Ire3andwith another.
At this point THE PRIME MINISTER started to read a Noteprepared by the Lord Chief Justice on the progress of his negotiations with Mr Kennedy, ICG. (S.F.(b) 60) (Appendix I).After the Prime Minister had proceeded a short distance,THE SECRETARY OP STATE POP. THE COLONIES and THE LORD privy seal interrupted- to explain that the Cabinet had not yetseen the criticisms of the Irish Constitution prepared bythe British Signatories of the Treaty.   THE LORD PRIVY SEAL(Appendix II),therefore first read these criticisms (S.P. (e) 35)y-after which THE PRIME MINISTER completed reading S,F,(b) SO.On the completion of the reading of the above documents,THE MINISTER OP HEALTH observed that the position appearedto be exactly what it was at the time of the Invernessmeetings,THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OP WORKS remarked that it was,in some respects, worse, as the draft Constitution appearedto be a deliberate breach of the Treaty.   It %?as evidentthat the draughtsman must have been instructed to prepare a constitution on these lines three months ago.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that the draughtsman must haveacted: under instructions.   He felt that there should be nofurther postponement.   The first thing to be done was forthe Cabinet to ascertain the exact position, whether theIrish representatives proposed to carry out the Treaty ornot.    Second, if they decided to take this action, theCabinet would have to settle in what form they should put the question;    for example, what special points should beput.    Third, they had to decide what action should be tatenif the Irish refused to bring their Constitution into line with the Treaty.THE MINISTER OP EDUCATION asked if the position had changed since the Cabinet considered it on May 30th ?-4-
THE PRIME MINISTER replied that the position had changed.On May 30th the suggestion had been that the Constitutionwas only a draft and that the Irish representatives wereperfectly ready to bring it into line with the Treaty towhich they adhered. The position today was that the lord chief Justice, after discussing the Constitution with theIrish legal representative, had reported that he could make no progress, and had handed to the Prime Minister the docu-meht (S.F.(b) 60) containing the following note on the lastpage:-&quot;Mr Kennedy stated that he was Instructedthat, according to the views of the IrishMinisters, Parliament Is not to he Summonedor dissolved, nor are Ministers, Judges orother public officers, to &quot;be appointed inthe name of the Crown, as in Canada&quot;*THE LORD PRIVY SEAL pointed out that this note was ini-tialled by Mr Kennedy and the Lord Chief Justice.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the idea had been that two members of the Government should see the Irish represents-tives that afternoon.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL recalled the circumstances in whichthe British Signatories of the Treaty had met Mr Griffith,and Mr Collins.   The two latter gentlemen had first askedto see the Prime Minister, who had felt, however, that itwould be better if he were accompanied by some of his col-leagues ,    The Conversation had not been opened by the Iri3hrepresentatives, but by the Prime Minister hires elf,   ThePrime Minister had informed the Irish representatives thathe himself had only been able to glance at the Constitutionwhile driving to Downing Street, and that his colleaguesalso had not had time for a complete study of it.   He had.,however, taken a very serious view of the situation   as die-closed by a preliminary reading,   Mr Griffith and Mr Collinshad then replied that the draft Constitution was meant to be-5-
in conformity with the Treaty.   This had been repeated later&quot;by themselves and by other Irish representatives in a moreformal meeting.    Subsequently, Lord Hewart had met Mr Kennedyin order to discuss the Constitution.   After the first meet-ins Lord Hewart had appeared hopeful;    after the second meet-ing, however, he had reported that he could get no further,and his report included the statement which had just beenread .THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL ashed what was thereason for this volte-face?&apos; - THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that it certainly was not mr churchill&apos;s speech, which, according to all . avail able inform-ation, had not been objected to by the Irish representatives:.He could only guess the reason.   His guess would be thatWhen the Irish representatives received the criticisms ofthe Constitution they had realised that the gap between thetwo parties was too large to be bridged.   They had seenthat they must either quarrel with De Valera or with theBritish. Government.   This theory was rather borne out bythe way they had used the interval, namely, to ask for ameeting with the Prime Minister aid to raise the questionof the disturbances in Ulster.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the attitude of theIrish representatives was that their position was renderedimpossible by events in Ulster.    They maintained that the roman Catholic public in the South was so excited by what had happened in Ulster that it prevented them from goingany further.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said he had little doubt that theIrish representatives had come to the conclusion that theywould have to quarrel either with De Valora or with theBritish Government.   They were, no doubt, influenced by theattitude of their critics, who pointed to the murders in
1 9 ni o icrit icsUlster, where, as these/ no doubt pointed out, there was alarge British Arm:/ as well as $one 48,000 Special Police,towards the upkeep of which the British Government had contributed 55,000,000.   That, he believed, was Mr Collins&apos;case,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES pointed outthat a very serious case could be made on the other side.It eould be shown that the supporters of the Sinn Feinparty in Ulster, with the support of the I.R.A,, was making government impossible in the North.   So far as hecould ascertain, they had been delighted with his speech in the House of Commons on the previous day.THE LORD PRIVY seal pointed out that two days ago MrCollins had been induced with the greatest difficulty tocome to his own room in the House of Commons,   On theprevious day, however, they had asked for tickets to listen to the Debate, si d had taken the most prominent seats In theDistinguished Strangers&apos; Gallery,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES felt very little doubt/ that the Irish representatives were drifting about ingreat uncertainty, refusing to face tip to either side,THE PRIME MINISTER then read a bulletin which had beenissued by the Irish. Publicity Department, in which statis-tics were given In regard to the murders In Belfast over aperiod dru-ing which the murders of Catholics had greatlyexceeded the murders of Protestants.   This, he felt, was undoubtedly the weakest part of the British ease.Tm SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES pointed out kthat the ease had not been stated for the other side, andthat a terrific case could be made out by Sir James Craig.Spread over a period of three years, this case would show-very big figures of murders by the Catholics.SHE MINISTER OF HEALTH asked whether the present attitudeof the Irish was not merely preparing the way for the
resignation of Mr Griffith and Mr Collins?   How, he asked, couldthey ever hope to work with De Valera and his supporters and yetcarry out the Treaty?   He asked what would happen if an ulti-matum were given to the Irish, with the result that the Pro-viaional Government were to resign?THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that that was the diffi-culty that had faced them for some days .THE MINISTER OP EDUCATION asked whether more could be done at present than the following:-(l) To say that the Constitution was altogetherunacoeptable:(2) To undei^take the restoration of order in Belfastby means of martial law or any other availablemethod:(g) To initiate a full enquiry by the Commission intothe Belfast disorders and outra-ges.If the Provisional Government were to resign, the British dovem-ment would be free to take what action they thought fit, and todo it in their own time.   Why, he asked, should they take any action in other parts of Ireland before they had restored orderin the North, where they had assumed certain responsibilities?THE LORD PRIVY SEAL asked why Mr Fisher put Ulster in the dock and ignored the South, of Ireland?THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION said he had assumed it was probable that there would be a break with the South of Ireland.Prejudice, however, would be excited by the fact that theoutrages had been more intense in Balfast than elsewhere,where the British Government was paying for part of the forces for the maintenance of order.
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER explained that therewas some misunderstanding, as to the British payments on aeehunt of forces in Ulster,     The Ulster Governmentbore the cost of all the ordinary Constabulary, and halfthe cost of the Special Constabulary, the other halfbeing borne by the British Government.     The chargeactually incurred by the British Government up to september was not  5,000,000 hut  800,000.   It was true that ih e northern Parliament were asking for alarger subvention, which the British Parliament had not/nyet paid. The Ulster Government invited the fullest inspectioand/enquiry by the British Government into the way theyperformed their duties *THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that/   the figure of  5,0) 0,000 had arisen in this way :-if the present situation continued and did not improve the total expenditure by the British Government might possibly reach  5,000,000,THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE observed that thesal lent point speared to him to be that the moment thedraft Constitution was published, there would be a greatoutburst among those who had supported the Government intheir Irish policy, but with some misgivings.   these would claim that the Constitution was the negation ofall that they stood for.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER made the followingremarks as to the three questions mentioned by thePrime Minister :-(1)   He thought that action must be taken at once in order to satisfy those who had supported the Governmentwith/
with misgivings, and to whom Sir Arthur Griffith Boscawen had alluded.(g)   If the Irish representatives were only-asked in general terns if they were supporting theTreaty, they would only give an answer in general terms. &apos;It was essential to put specific points to them, though he admitted it was difficult to selectthe points.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the thirdpoint he had put was what was to be done if the answer to the first question was unsatisfactory.THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS expressed doubt as to -whether the Irish Provisional Government wouldfulfil their promise to publish the Constitution.THE SEC RET AR Y OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES thought they would fulfil their promise.   They were pledged toBe Valera to do so.     He admitted that in their desireto wriggle out of a cjiarrol, with either side theymight shrink from publication, but he thought that inthe end they yjould publish something.   The question for decision now was whether to mace our break withthe Irish now by unfolding our terms and demanding acategorical answer.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that what was required was the view of the Cabinet on this question.   Hesuggested that there should be an interval of fiveminutes during which the Cabinet should read a tabularcomparison which had been prepared between theCanadian Constitution and the draft Irish Constitution,S.F,(C) 35.THE/
THE PRIME MINISTER said that the points stoodout clearly in which the Irish draft Constitutionconflicted with, the Canadian^   The most markedpoints of difference were as follows :-(1)   The position of the Crown was repudiated.(s)   The Treaty making power was vested in theIrish Government.(3)    The Judicial Committee of the privy council was rejected as the final Court of Appeal.(4)    The Oath was not included in the Document .Thus the Irish were challenging the mostfundamental points of the Treaty.The question to be decided was what was to bedone in the face of that attitude, when it should bedone and how it should be done.     The first point todecide was as to whether the time had come fordemanding an explicit answer on vital definitequestions .THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said it was clear that itwas impossible to accept anything In the nature oftheir Constitution. If they could not conform tothe requirements of the Treaty as set forth in theBritish Memorandum, the British Government oughtto resume their freedom.THE &quot;SECRETARY OP STATE PGR WAR urged that thesituation should be cleared up at once, otherwise the is sue would be confused by border raids andso forth.     At present there was a clear issue, andadvantage should be taken of this situation.-11- THE/
THE MINISTER OP HEALTH pointed but that theIrish Representatives would probably wish toreturn to Dublin to confer with their friends.THE PRIME MINISTER said it would be necessaryto permit this.THE MINISTER OP E.JUCAT lOii said it was clearthat the Irish must be told to-day that their draft Constitution could not be accepted.THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COiJMCIL said thathe would tell them in broad terms that this draftdid not carry out the Treaty, and that if theywould not bring their draft into line with theTreaty the British Government must hold themselvesfree.     His advice would be to sent for Sir JamesGraig and to consult with Mm as to the positionin Belfast.   In addition he would take the militarysteps which had been mentioned on the previous day,* and&apos; he would consider the desirability of establish-ing a blockade.THE PRIME MINISTER then pointed out that instead of a blockade it might be better to take steps to curtail the revenue.   He had consulted the Chief of the Imperial General Staff on certain military questions connected v/ith this, and lord cavan had very properly replied that he requiredtime for further consideration.     He did not see how the Cabinet could separate without taking adecision on this question.The proposal was that two or three members-12- of/
of the Cabinet should see the Irish Representatives *They had felt, however, that the Cabinet must heconsulted first in order to ascertain whether theywe re unanimously in favour of a strong declarationfacing the Irish Provisional Government with theTreaty,He would also like the Cabinet to considerthe following points to-morrow(1)   The reply of the Irish Representatives,(2)    The Report of the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff,(3)    The Report which he hoped the admiralty would furnish in regard to the assistance th eycould give.He thought that before the nexrt; meeting ofthe Cabinet there should be a consultation between representatives of the Admiralty, War Officeand Air Ministry on the various military questions involved,
THUS LORD PRIVY SEAL pointed out that if therewere a &quot;break with the Irish Representatives theposition of loyalists in the South of Ireland might be very serious.     He hoped, therefore, that thequestion of refugee camps would not he overlooked.THE SBCBETAKY OP STATE POR THE COLONIES saidthat after the receipt of the document hy Lord Hewartand Mr. Kennedy, It was irapossihle for us to allow thesituation to go on for 24 hours without making it clearthat the Constitution would have to he re-drafted ifwe were to he satisfied.     That, in his view, was thehost way of getting to &quot;business and there might hein that way, still a chance of their coming to heel.He agreed that if necessary the IrishRepresentatives must he allowed to go hack to Buhlinto consult with their colleagues,     Though they neednot he given an ultimatum it should he understoodthat &amp;w must he/nlg&amp;tuU, within a few days.     Hedouhted if it was any use meeting them again.   Hethought it would he hotter to hand them a documentstating precisely the view of the British Government.If they were allowed to meet again, they would wanderweakly over the whole suhject once more withoutreaching any decision.     If they were really desirous of a final issue it would have been different.     Thepoint was, however, that the Government ought to knowdefinitely whether they intended to adhere to theTreaty.     As regards the steps to he taken in theevent of a refusal on the part of the Irish to adhere to the Treaty, he thought the &quot;best plan would he toappoint a Committee to prepare a general report on the/investigations
investigations which had already been carried out.This would take two or three days.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the cabinet ought to have a general idea of the position before they separated.     He did not think it possible to postpone -srfc for two or three days.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES pointed ,out that not only military considerations butalso economic and financial issues were involved.THE LORD CHANCELLOR hoped that, in view of the gravity of the decision to be taken, a fresh meetingef the Cabinet would be held on the morrow.     Heinclined, to the view that a further meeting with theIrish that afternoon would be of no use.     The Irishrepresentatives would merely give further expression to their goodwill and good intentions,  but no result would be achieved.     As a lawyer he felt that the time had come when something should be placed on record.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that if that wasthe view of the Cabinet, it would be advisable toappoint a Committee to draft a document.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought it inadvisable tohave an elaborate document.     He would merely say thatthe Government had received the report of the lord chief Justice on his interview with Mr, Kennedy whichwas to the effect that the Constitution was incompatible with the Treaty.     He would then simply ask the question as to whether the Irish would bring their Constitutioninto line with the Treaty as set forth in the documentof criticism sent to them a few days before (S.F.(C)3!?)THE LORD PRESIDENT OE THE COUNCIL agreed withthe Prime Minister that the situation in Ulster createdthe main difficulties.     The Ulster view was that&quot;V /these
these outrages were not only due to old-standinganimosities between the Roman Catholics and theoProtestants, but were being deliberately fermentedfrom the South with a view to breaking up thewhole Treaty policy.     He did not know which side wastelling the truth, but it was vital that everything possible should be done to put ourselves right \viththe world and to shew that we are doing all that wecan to put a stop to the murders of catholics and the counter a^&amp;ssirhfrJsns of protest ant a.     Hence, he felt it was very important to consult with Sir James Craigas to the best way of crushing out this disorder and to utilise the military forces available for the purpose in this comparatively restricted area.- Prom a letter from Sir James Craig which he hadbeen shewn, he gathered that the latest phase of thedisorder was a succession of serious cases of criminalarson.     This aspect of the question mist also beconsidered.&apos; , THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR THE COLONIES suggestedthat some members of the Cabinet who felt strongly onthe Ulster situation should make a point of seeingSir James Craig.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed, but wished the whole world, whether Catholic or Protestant to feel that theBritish Government was doing its utmost impartiallyto deal with the situation.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL suggested that Lord Balfourshould see Sir James Craig.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed and urged that lord balfour should put the matter in its widest aspectswith the idea of strengthening the general position of-16- /the British
the British Government before the Empire and the world.THE MIHXSTBH OF EDUCATION said that on theprevious day a distinguished Canadian judge - Protestant *had come to see him and^said that the general opinion in Canada was that we had mads a fair off61* to the Irishbut the murders in Belfast were causing anxiety and he,as a judge, was impressed with the fact that there hadbean no punishment of the murderers.     That was having aconsiderable effect.SIR MAURICE HAWKEY reported that on the same morning he had seen Sir Charles Gordon who had been oneof the Canadian Representatives on the Genoa Conference.Sir Charles though..stressing no doubts himself as. tothe British attitude had expressed some misgivings asto whether the moral position of the British Governmentwas fully realised in America and the Dominions.THE SECRETARY OP STATE PGR WAR said that if therewere a break there would have to be a great campaign of propaganda.This remark led to some further discussion as toto the. form of the dowiment, namely as to whether itshould be a short document which, it was claimed, wouldbe more widely read, or a comprehensive document whichwould set forth in full the British case.The Cabinet agreed(a) That an interview which had been provisionally arranged to take place between the Lord Chancellor, the lord chief Justice, Mr. Griffith and Mr.Collins, should be cancelled.(b) That the British signatories of theTreaty with the addition of Lord Balfourshould meet at 3*30 that afternoon to draft a document conveying to theIrish Representatives the views of theBritish Government on the Draft Constitution-17- /  tc)

DRAFT CONSTITUTION OF IRISH PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT.

Note, on Progress of Negotiations.

On Saturday 27th May the Draft Constitution of the Irish Provisional Government was handed to the Assistant secretary to the Cabinet. On Monday, May 28th,. a memorandum criticising this document on behalf of the British Government was handed to the Irish Ministers. It was informally arranged that efforts should be made to remodel the Draft Constitution so as to make it conform to the Treaty.  To this end. ?ormal conferences were held on Tuesday and Wednesday, the 30th and 31st May, between Mr, Kennedy, K.C., and the Lord Chief Justice of England. The draft constitution with suggested amendments and additions was considered. No agreement, however, was arrived at. A document expressing the views of the Irish Ministers (Appendix) was handed to the Chief Justice under the name of

"OBSERVATIONS /
V OBSERVATIOKS ON THE&apos; CRITICISM OF THE BRITISHGOVERNMENT ON THE DRAFT IRISH CONSTITUTION.    -(1)    It is essential;,,,If there is to to mutualtuidorstanding in approaching.&quot; the questions raised^,that one or tv;o considerations of soecial importanceshould be kept constantly, in view.    . It Is we11%therefore, that these matters . should&apos; be emphasisedby way of preface to the observations on theparticular criticisms which have been raised.  .(2)    In the first place&apos;, Ireland is not a Britishcolony nor are her people British colonists1, though there is a small proportion.of British colonistsamong them.     This fact is the vital distinguishingfeature that differentiates- Ireland and the mattersnow under consideration from the position of any ofthe great Dominions of the British. Commonwealth- .: .       of Nations,(5) &quot;-The matter of the preceding paragraph, leadseasily to the next consideration, so generally lostsight of in England and by the minority who are ofBritish sympathies in Ireland but 7iaich is anessential fundamental consideration in approaching the questions between England and Ireland, andparticularly the matters which have been raised onthe draft constitution,,      It is this.     The greatbody of law&apos;, institutions and forms, called the&quot;English Common Law&quot;., which has sprung from and sogrown to fulness with the genius and character ofthe English people as to be part -of their livingfibre&apos;, is not/
not i:o Ireland, a Common Law at a 11*      It isan alien structure imposed by statute, an exoticfrom which a cutting has been artificially fosteredin Ireland but which has not taken root or becomeacclimatised in any real sense.    English colonistshave carried with&apos;them, among their penates, tothose countries which are now the great Dominions,/their own English Commdn Lav; and habits of thoughtformed in relation to it;    Hence it is that in themaking of constitutions for their new homes, their -.minds spring naturally to the institutions and formsembedded in the English Common Law.     The true import and precise implications of which find instinctiveinterpretation Which, does hot confuse the familiar formwith familiar substance *     By the very nature of things,this is not, and cannot be \ the case in Ireland..The institutions, forms and ceremonials of theEnglish Common Law have never been absorbed bythe ,Irish People or become in ahy true sonsetheir own,      They have remained (however reverentiallyIrish -lawyers may have applied&apos;themselves to the study and exposition of them) the features of aforeign system and of alien rule,(4)       After the Treaty had been entered into,,glowing speeches were made by leading Englishstatesmen,  expounding as. the inspiration of newhopes that now the Irish, people would,
with. freedom,from.i!kiglish interference- or influence,set themselves to build up a constitution for thegovernment of their own country which constitution-would be wholly of their creation and in accordancewith their Own wishes and views1 of their needs, with full play for Irish traditions and Irish thought togive colouf and lend vitality to the framing&apos; and building up of institutions which the Irish people could honour as their own.

CURTIS 31st May,  1932Secretary to the Irish Conference.
I, For the purpose of examining the draft constitution propound-ed       on the 27th May last by the Provisional Government, it isessential to have regard to certain cardinal matters1. The constitution of the Irish Pree State must be inaccordance with the Treaty which was entered into by the repre-seatatives of Great Britain and the representatives of Ireland onthe 6th December, 1921, and to which the force of law was givenby the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act, 192-3,,   A constitutioncontaining anything inconsistent with the Treaty,  or omittingany of its relevant stipulations would obviously not bo inaccordance with the Treaty.go By the Treaty, the representatives of Ireland sgr^sd:-Ja) That Ireland should have the same constitutional status in the Community of Uations Icaown as the&quot;British Empire as the Dominion of Canada, theCommonwealth of Australia, the Dominion of NewZealand, and the Union of South Africa;,  (ArticleI of the Treaty);ih) That the position of the Irish free State inrelation to the Imperial Parliament and Governmentand otherwise should be that of the Dominion ofCanada, and that the law practice and constitu-tional usage governing the relationship of theCrown or the representative of tho Crown and ofthe Imperial Parliament to that Dominion should govern their relationship to tha Irish Pree State(Article 2 of the Treaty);(c) That the representative of the Crown in ireland should be appointed in liice manner as theGovernor General of Canada,  and in aooordancewith tho practice observed in the making of such appointments (Article 3 of tho Treaty),
3. The fundamental principles of the constitution of Canadaare : --    (a) That the executive authority is vested in the Grownwhich acts on the advioe of Ministers0   The Crownappoints a representative to be the chief executive officer of the dominion in whose name all acts ofState are performed,(b) That the Crown is a constituent part of the Legisls-ture.    Hence it Is that the i;o;&amp;1 assent, to Bills isrequired and that Parliament is summoned and dissolvedIn the name of the ^Cingo(c) That the Crown is the fountain of justice, and thatthere is a right to petition the, Crown for leave to-appeal to the&quot;Privy Council against/decision of theSupreme Court of the Dominion.4.      It. is by the relation thus established between the Crown andthe Executive, the Legislature and the Judicature that the con-stitutional position of the Zing as the head of the Community ofHations known as the British Empire is secured.5*     The Throne is the bond which knits together the Community ofNations known as the British Empire,    ho constitution which isin form or In substance xiepubliean can find a place within that community.    The Throne is non-political and non-partisan becausenon-elective.    This is the essential quality which enables the throne to symbolize &apos; above political, national and all other dis-tinctions whatsoever,    the common citizenship of. all His Majesty1^subjects, whatever their nation or raoo, and,the common membershipin the Commonwealth of all His Majesty&apos;s Governments, whatever their status or history.    As Professor. Dice:.; has said: &quot;Theprerogatives of the Crown have become thy privileges of the people&quot;.If the draft constitution now propounded..is examined in thelight of these principles, it appears to be not so much a&apos; departure from the Treat/ as a direct negation of It.    In- other words,  itis not an acceptance but a refusal te accept the constitutional,status of the self-governing Dominions, and is, in fact, ahepublican constitution almost without disguise and adapted for en.independent iJtate.
Ifare it&quot; not for * iw referenoefe&apos; to&quot; thsr &apos;Tre^ty*in^ Articles &apos;74 and 75, it would be difficult to believe that theframers of the constitution were aware of the existenceof the Treaty,     Until-Article 74 is reached, the Constitutetloh is the const!tutioh of-an independent republic,with its President and VIc^-President.     The  jp&amp;etior.       *arises:    Are Articles74 and 75 a sufficient qualification&quot;^of wbat has preceded them to bring the constitution into conformity with the Treaty?     Article 74 requires theLegislature and the Executive established by the consti-tution to pass the legislation and do all other thingsnecessary for implementing the Treaty.     Article 75alone contains any reference to the Sovereign or to therep-resentative of the Crown,     It:-(1)    lays down that the representative of theCx-own is to be styled the commissioner of the British -Commonwealth;(2)    imposes a restriction on the discretion of the Crown In appointing its represerrta--&apos; - tive by expressly making the appointmentsubject to the previous assent of the-Irish Executive council(5.)    compels the representative of the Crownautomatic-ally and immediately to set his hand to any enactment which has teen sealedby tho President1, and thereby to signifythe Royal assent.In practice Dominion Governments are always consulted as to the choice of the Governor-General,     But that Isa very different thing from raaking an appointment subject b;Statute to the assent of the Irish ExecutiveCouncil, vBy constittvtional practice the exercise of the powerof vetoing bills passed by the Dominion legislatures is.obsolete so far as legislation of a purely domesticcharacter is concerned, except where by the constitutionItself measures of a particular nature are reqiired to be reserved/

But withrespect      DomiSaion measures affecting relations withother parts of the Ssvpire sr X7ith f-oreign nations the reservation of the power of veto is obviously essenfeial^ ....-.heugh in the 1-g.st re-sort it would only be exercised -on the advice of the Imperial Conference, that, is to say, -or. behalf of the British Commonwealth as a whole,If&quot; It were said that any discrepancies between theConstitution and the Treaty are required by Article 74 tobe set right by legislation,., the answer is that with thebest will In the-&apos;world the Legislature would probably bemable to perform this- task.     Such, changes would beaTOsridraents of the constitution, required by Article 47to be submitted to a referendum of the people, and at thareferendum to be approved either hy a majority of-thetotal number of electors on the /register or by a tws-thljfds majority of those who vote on the question,,Some of the principal points on which the law asIrishlaid down In the draft/sojtistitution differs from the. lawand practice of the constitution in Canada may be seen by a comparison of the provisions as to  &apos;1) theexecutive&apos;,   (2) the legislature, and (3) the Judicaturein &apos;   .

3. Judicature.

Canadian Constitution.

Draft Irish Constitution.

Judges are appointed by ? Governor-General on the ?vice of the Dominion Government.

Judges are appointed by the Executive Council without reference to the Representative of the Crown. 

The common law right of a British subject to appeal to His Majesty&apos;s Privy Council from the ?ourts of a Dominion is expressly recognised by Statute.

The decisions of the Supreme Court are final and conclusive and not capable of being reviewed by any Court. Tribunal or Authority whatsoever,and the subject is deprived of his common-law right to appeal to the privy Council.

To Summarise, by Constitutional practice the Representative of the Crown in exercising his executive authority, in appointing and removing members of his Council, in summoning and dissolving Parliament, in appointing judges, and, subject to the qualifications stated in paragraph III, in giving and withholding the Royal Assent to Bills, ?ots upon the advice of his Ministers.

But throughout the British Empire all writs issued under the authority of the State, whether executive or judicial, run without exception in the name of the Crown.


V* Constitutional practice as affecting therelations of the Crown&apos;,&apos; the Imperial Conferenceand the different Governments of the Empirewas fully discussed at the last ImperialConference, and a very strong objection wasrecorded against any attempt to crystallinethe custom and practice of the constitution in a writ toil document.      It was, moreover,declared that any change in the status of a dominion was a matter of vital interest toall the Dominions and therefore not to bedetermined without reference to the ImperialConference as a wholev      It foliows thatif the constitutional status of the FreeState is to be in essence the same as thatof Canada, as laid dorm in the Treaty, theconstitution of the Free State must be. &apos;;$Tamed on broadly the some lines as that oftho Dominion *     Any variation from the accepted constitutional forms would not bein accordance, with the Treaty and couldnot be.sanctioned by the British Gov-ernment without reference to and consentof.   the Imperial Conference.,
External-relations-are. dealt -with by Article 72a    By it therelations between the Free State and other states are to be suchas are now or may hereafter be defined in Agreements or Treatiesmade between the Irish Free State and other states to which theFree State assents.   Ho Agreement or Treaty with any other state is to have any validity unless and until it has been approved bythe Free State Parliament.    The effect is, therefore, to give theFree State Parliament complete and independent control of allthe foreign relations of the Free State, end the power of theBritish Government to ratify any treaty affecting the Free state is expressly excluded.    It appears impossible to harmonise thisArticle 73 with Article 2 of the Treaty, and the power of makingindependent Treaties without reference to their effect on otherMembers of the British Commonwealth of Nations is one which isnot reconcilable with the interdependence which is an essentialcharacteristic of that Commonwealth, nor with the recorded viewof the Dominion Governments at the last Imperial Conference.    TheZing is, in fact, and must remain, the Treaty-making power,though the constitutional practice is that in all matters efaffecting the Empire as a whcls9 he exercise a this power onbzoad lines approved by the Imperial Conference and on the advice of all the Governments concerned..Further, the words of article 73 are open to the interpre-tation that the Treaty itself falls within the Article, and thatthe Parliament of the Free State has power to determine how far the Treaty is to be regarded as valid and binding upon the FreeStats0    The words &quot;and other States&quot;, in line 1 of Article 73,are capable of being interpreted not only as applying to foreignState3 but also as applying either to the British Commonwealthof Nations as a whole or to Individual Dominions within it.In this connection it is to be observed that by the draftIrish constitution the interpretation of Treaties is entrusted
&quot;to the final jmris-diction of the-Snp^eme- -Curort ^4xtioJu&amp;^4i4--&apos;-&amp;M-and that under Article&apos;75 the duties, such&apos;as they are, of theCommissioner of the British i6!cra^sEPaalth continue only solong as the relations he tureen the Preo State and the BritishOomm^m^aXth of Nations aro regulated by the Treaty.The matters hitherto dealt with are instance^of inconsistency between the constitution and the Treaty.But the Treaty contains restrictions and - impose a obligations as to which the constitution is altogether silent.     The&quot;restrictions contained in the,Treaty.include*:-fa)   1 limitation on the power of makingprevision for naval defence;(b)    A limitation of the extent of military ,establishments;to)    A restriction on the closing of ports;(d) limitations on the exercise of powers inSorthern Ireland; :(e) Restrictions for securing religious equality;The positive, obligations imposed by the Treaty include -(a) Talcing of. oaths by members of parliament in the form prescribed;(b) The assumption of liability for a share ofthe national debt and pensions;fc) burnishing of harbour and other facilities,including In time of war or of strainedrelations with a foreign Power such harbour and other facilities as the British Governmentmay require for the purpose of defence;fd) The payment Of compensation to existing&apos;fudges and public officers.With one exception,  the only provision containedin the constitution with respect to these restrictions and obligations is that contained in Article 74, above mentioned,enjoining the Parliament and Government of the Free state to pass legislation and take steps for. implementing theTreaty.     The one exception is that there is an expressprovision as to religious equality, but it falls far short of the express obligations contained in Article 16 of thetTreaty.
given if it may be contended that the general provisions&apos; ofArticle 74 are sufficiently in accord with the provisions ofthe Treaty so far as it imposes positive.obligations, it cannotbe said that a constitution which Is not expressly made subjectto the restrictive provisions contained in the Treaty is onewhiGh the party to the Treaty at TChose&apos;: instance the restrictions were inserted can be asked to accept,    further, the omission of so vital a provision as that requiring an oath in the prescribed ,form to be taken by cgembers of Parliament cannot be countenanced.In connexion with the Oath it is also necessary to considerArticle 48&apos;Of the draft constitution, which by requiring, thatsome of the Ministers are. not to be members of Parliament exemptsthem from the obligation of taking the prescribed oath.An obligation thrown on a Legislature to pass certainlegislation, an obligation which   by the nature of Parliamentaryinstitutions is impossible of enforce merit&apos;9 is no substitute for .an express enactment, in the constitution giving those obligationseffect.    &apos;It should be added that these observations do not purportto bs an exhaustive criticism of the draft constitution.    3?heyare merely a preliminary memorandum, written within a few hoursof receipt of the draft, and intended not to exhibit in detailbut only to illustrate how gravely the draft Irish constitution -is in conflict with the terms of the Treaty.    It cannot be acceptedby His Majesty7s Government: as a fulfilment of the solemnengagement signed on the 6th December, 19SI, by the repreeenta-tives of Great Britain and Ireland.Whitehall Gardens, iv.-w.,:29th May, 1922.
