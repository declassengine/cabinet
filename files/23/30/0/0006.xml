With reference to Cabinet  7(8*5) Minute 4,the Cabinet had under consideration the situationwhich had arisen as a result of the adverse vote in the House of Gosaaons on the previous afternoon,on the motion for the adjournment of the discussioncm the Teachers Superannuation Bill.The Cabinet wore informed- that the actualdivision in the House of Commons was unexpected,and had taken place at 7.30 p.a. instead of 9.30 p.in.- as had been anticipated.     The Covemraent Whips had endeavoured to collect sufficient supporters in the short time available, and shout 425 members were actually at ^esb^ins-to^C of whoa        voted and 126-frMcd.     Bora cohort Cecil*s motion for the adjournment had been moved in oonsetuen.ee of the allegation that when the teachers had accepted theBarnhaia Scales, they had dona so because they had understood that the non-contributory pension scheme under the Act of 1918 would continue to operate, andthey regarded the contributory pension scheme con-tained in the present Bill as a breach of this under*taking.     The Cabinet were reminded that the Presi-dent of the Board of Education had dealt fully andconclusively with this aspect of the question in thecourse of the debate, and that the Lord privy Sealhad urged that the House of Commons could not properly refer the question whether the honour ofthe House was pledged in this matter to theDepartmental Cobalttee which had been sot up, alsothat if a Select Committee of the House of Commonswsss appointed, that Committee would merely have toascertain/- 1 -
ascertain the facts which were already known.Emphasis had been laid on the fact that the burnham committee was an Advisory Committee, and that theGovernment had not accepted its recommendations infall.     In view of this consideration it was difficultto understand how the teachers could justify the allegation of breach of faith.The Lord Privy Seal also informed the Cabinetthat he had heen warned of the possibility of an adverse vote, and. that after consulting with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the President of theBoard of Education, he had come to the conclusionthat it would he on the whole less disadvantageousto the Government to be defeated on an economy issue,than to placate the Opposition hy a surrender.     Afterthe adjournment of the House he (Mr. Chamberlain) haddespatched two telegrams to the Prime Minister (seeAppendix I).     In the second telegram he had indicatedthree courses:      (1) The abandonment of the Bill which,in the circumstances meant an intolerable humiliation;( ) to refuse acceptance of the adverse decision andre-introduce the Bill, making the second reading aquestion of confidence -   the principal objection tothe course being the certainty that in the presentfeeling of the House great difficulties would be experienced in the committee stage of the Bill; and(3) to accept the decision of the House that thereshould be set up a small Select Committee to enquire into the facts.     This third alternative would involve some delay, and would render it impossible to ante-date the provisions of the Bill to the beginning ofthe/
the current financial year.     Teachers received their salaries monthly, i.,nii it would he most undesirable to throw a substantial amount of the 5^ pension deductionon to .tho later months of the yesf.ro     In the do elr-oumstanoes it would be necessary at once to introduce a supplementary estimate for 000 in respect ofthe first three months of l$E2-*r3.     The oost to theMxoheqmv amounted to  200,000 a month.     A reply had just- been received from the  rime Minister in which he expressed the hope that the Cloveraaaent would stand firm.The Lord Privy Seal then read, to the Cabinetthe terms of a statement which he propose-; to makein the House of Commons that afternoon, in the eventof the Cabinet agreeing to adopt the third line ofaction.The Cabinet discussed at some length the questionof the desirability of remitting the question to theSelect Committee.     It was urged that the teacherswho appeared before the Committee would undoubtedlyall represent that they only accepted the BumhamScales on the distinct understanding that the non-contributory pension arrangements would continue inforce.     Lord Bumhsm would no doubt give evidence on the linos of a latter dated April 28th, which hehad written to Sir W-. Joynaon Hicks, to the effectthat while there was nothing on the face of thenegotiations, either expressed or implied, to showthat a aon-coatributory scheme of pension determined the scales of salaries recommended by the Coaimitteefon the other hand, it was common knowledge that a non-contributory scheme had been sanctioned by parliament.and/

and was in existence.     In these circumstances it was almost.inevitable that the Select Committee should find that the Burnham Scales were materially influenced by the.existence of the non-contributory pension scheme,and it would be very difficult, if not impossible, forthe Government in the face of such a finding to insist on the passage of the Bill, mad make the matter &amp; cjuee-tioa of confidence.     It was also urged. that so far asthe Government were concerned It had been made perfectly clear that the Government were in no vsay pledged to carryout in full the recommendations of the Burnham Heport,and indeed it had been stated that if the teachersinsisted on higher scalee than the Burnham Committeewere prepared to recommend, the whole of the Burnhamproposals would have to bo- rejected.     While no doubt the nature of the pension scheme might have been inthe minds of the parties, it was never mentioned in theminutes of the Sumh&amp;m CommitteG, and it was inconooiv-able that any reasonable^person could justify a chargeof breach of faith against the Government in thematter.onOn the other hand It was urged that/a questionof this kind It was desirable to allow the House ofCommons to take an independent line if it thought thisdesirable.     &apos;?o appoint the Committee, and- then possi-bly disregard its findings would amount to ridingrough shod, over the House, *md would invite obstructionof the Bill.     The teachers were in a position toexcite considerable opposition in the country, andthere might bo ultimately something to be. said for theGovernment submitting to the clearly expressed will ofthe House of Commons which would realise, as a resultof/
of the supplementary estimate, the eon sequences ofrejecting this particular economy.     Prom this point ofview it was suggested that when the Keport of theSelect Committee had been received,the Governmentshould, if they thought no new facts had. been broughtto light justifying a different course, again submit the Bill to the judgment of the House *     It was also pointed out that if, as seemed possible, overwhelmingevidence was given from the teachers * side before theCommittee, the Committee might find the teachers were under a general impression as to the maintenance of theexisting pension arrangements, and accordingly could notbe said to be wrong in thinking that there.was an Impliedguarantee.She Cabinet were assured by the Government Whipsthat, while there -would he no serious difficulty inobtaining a second reading,-it was certain that many ofthe. strongest and raost respected supporters of theGovernment were net convinced on the question of the breach of faith, and that there would he very greatdifficulty in carrying the Bill through the committee stage.-She Cabinet ware also reminded that in additionto the present Mil there would have to be a similar Billfor Scotland, and. that in the case of Scotland the teachershad been subjected to alterations of policy of a disturh-ing nature.     Prior to 1918 the Scottish teachers hod beenguite satisfied with their contributory scheme.     Shis-scheme had had to be abandoned, in consequence of the !j!8Act, end the provisions of the non-contributory scheme under that Act had now in turn been abandoned, and a newcontributory scheme was being proposed.After/- b -
1*1 rtibafter some further discussion the cabinet agreed  -(11    To accept the deaieloa of the Houseof Oossmons that there should be an enquiry Into the question by a SelectOoHRaittee of the House of Cosasaone;(2)     That this decision should be communicatedto the House of Commons by the Lord privy seal this afternoon by means of a state-nasnt, for the terms of which see Appendix II;(3)     That the terms of reference to theSelect Committee should be as follows to consider and report whether in fixing the present scales of salaries for teachers, any under-taking by the Government orParliament was given, or implied that the provisions of the TeachersSuperannuation Act, 1910, shouldnot be altered, while those scalesremain in force.

With reference to the foregoing discussion,the Cabinet had under consideration the questionof the composition of the proposed Select Committeeof the House of Commons, and in particular - whetherit was desirable that Cabinet Ministers should serveupon the Committee.The Cabinet agreed -(1) To request the lord Privy seal to settle the composition ofthe proposed Select Committeein consultation with theGovernment Whips;.

Bob Cecil moved adjournment of debate in order that Select Committee might beappointed to ascertain facts.     i&apos;islier and X resistedand in agreement with Fisher and Home I decided notto give-way though warned by &quot;iShips that situation wascritical.

Cypher telegram to Mr. Gregory (Genoa).Foreign Office.     17th May, 1922,    1.30 a.in.i^O s     **  .     ( 3D)MOJl^JJRGEST^Following for Prime Minister from Mr,, Chamberlain.Government defeat.     Three courses seem possible(1) abandon bill, (2) refuse to accept tonight&apos;s decision and make second reading question of confidence, (3) acceptdecision that there shall be enquiry by select committee.All three courses are objectionable.     Horne, Fisherand 1 agree that the first is an intolerable surrender to selfish agitation and that second would probably be unwise though certainly successful as far as secondreading is concerned.     Third course is the one thatwe shall probably recommend to Cabinet, but as this involves long delay in passing of Bill and makes itpractically impossible that scheme should take effect from the beginning of the financial year, we should announce at same time that we shall bring in a supplementary estimate for  600,000 to cover extra expenditure involved in delay of say three months.     Wethink that this will steady House and show countrygravity of issue.I am more concerned at this defeat on your accountthan on ours lest it should add to your difficulties at genoa.

STATEMENT MADE 133 THE HOUSE Off QOMMOflSBY THE DORP PRIVY SEAL7The Government have given careful consideration to the vote  &amp;f the House last night.      The Government cannot &quot;butconsider as a serious matter any refusal by the House tosupport them in the steps which they think necessary to secure a reduction In public expenditure and an alleviation of thepublic biirdens.       But, -whatever may be said about the exactsignificance of last night&apos;s vote, the decision of the House?;as given upon a dilatory motion upon which it was not inorder to argue the merits of the case.      In these circumstances the Government have decided to defer to the wish expressed bythe House that a small Select Committee, which the government think should consist of^fiaj&amp;a-, or.,aa,r-Sa-JrBly not mot-han .s.eve-ft-memteera-, should be appointed to ascertain and report the facts which the majority of the House appeared to think were in-sufficiently known, i^he reTer ence t o the Committee /gtk3A be asfollows:-To consider and report whether in fixing the presentscales of salaries for Teachers any undertaking bythe Government or Parliament was given or implied thatthe provisions of the  Teachers Superannuation Act 1918ahould not be altered while these scales remain in force.Immediate steps will be  taken by the Patronage Secretary to setup this Committee, which the Government hope will meet at once and proceed with all urgency.It is evident, however, that compliance with the wishes of the House will in any event involve considerable delay inthe passage of the Bill, and that it will consequently not bepossible to ante-date the new charge, if it is ultimatelyapproved by Parliament,  to the beginning of the financial year.
Until the contribution is imposed an additional burdenof approximately  200,000 a month will fall upon theExchequer and we shall at once lay a supplementary estimate for  600,000 to cover this charge during thefirst three months of the year.
