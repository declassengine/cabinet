(1) The attention of the Cabinet was called to the absence&apos;of several Ministers from each of the recent Meetings of theCabinet.    It was recalled that in former days, before theestablishment of the War Cabinet, it had been the custom ofCabinet Ministers to subordinate all other appointments to cabinet Meetings.   It was recognised, however, that it was extremely difficult for Ministers to avoid attendance at meetings of Parliamentary Committees under the new Bales,and. that the preparation of a speech for the afternoon wasa good &quot;round, for absence.   It was further suggested that,if possible, the Cabinet should revert to the former systemof holding regular Meetings every Wednesday morning.The Secretary was instructed, from todayonwards, to publish in the Press a notice in regard to&quot;&apos;Meetings, of the Cabinet,stating who were present.(3) The attention of the Cabinet was called to a Hoticein the house of Commons Papers for- Wednesday, November 5th,asking for an early day for the discussion of present con-ditions in Ireland. xThe Cabinet felt that, although a Debate at the present justice might have a prejudicial effect on the reception ofany measure for Home Rule to Ireland, should the CabinetCommittee succeed in evolving an acceptable plan, nevertheless there were some advantages in giving publicity to the present1state o** affairs in Ireland, where murder is more rife thanat any previous time.   It was further recognised that, if theParliamentary Opposition pressed it, a day for debate couldnot be refused.It was agreed ---That the Leader of the house, if asked for an answer today, should request that the mattertnlght be postponed, as the Chief Secretary wasindisposed, chit that if the matter was raisedagain next week he should agree to grant a day for the discussion of the Motion on Thursday,I o ve mb s r 1S t h.
(4) The suggestion was made that the Irish Office shouldbe asked to prepare a reasoned case in regard to Irelandwhich could be communicated to the Vatican by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, through the British DiplomaticRepresentative.    In this connection it was recalled that similar action, taken when hr Dalfour was Chief Secretary,had produced happy results, as on that occasion the Pope had sent a Special Representative to Ireland, whose report hadexercised a quieting influence on the Irish priesthood.In the absence of the Chief Secretary andthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.(5) With reference to Cabinet 2- (19), Minute 5, the Cabinetcontinued its discussion of the outstanding points withregard to Out-of-Work Donation and Unemployment Insurance.It was generally agreed  -(a) That the Government must strongly oppose the principle, advocated by the LabourParty, of a system of Unemployment Insur-an.ce the whole cost of which was borne bythe Government.   The policy of the Govern-laent was a scheme to - which employers andemployed, as well as the state, should con-tribute.   The completion of this scheme shouldbe pushed forward as rapidly as possible.This was a matter on which the Governmentshould be prepared to stand or fall.(b) That any extension of the Out-of-Work Donationmust be clearly announced as an emergency and temporary arrangement to meet the altogetherexceptional conditions produced by the fa?and to bridge over the period required tobring the Unemployment Benefit Scheme intooperat ion.(a) That the case of the workers in the royal dockyards, whose unemployment was entirelydue to the termination of the War and the resulting reduction in naval establishments,was entitled to special consideration.    TheseDockyard towns, which were important recruitingcentres for the Kavy and Army, already con-tained considerable numbers of unemployedex-sailors and soldiers, and a dangerous situation would be created if their nutsfoerwere augmented by large numbers of mendischarged from the Dockyards.    It was recognised that even the continuance of
unemployment werefurther aggravated by discharges from the dockyards.(d) That the schema which hadbeen suggested to the Admiralty &quot;leasing a     ^j^Afor leasing a. portion of tho ^^^iy^r   ^Royal Dockyards to  private  firms [XOnjWStkfor mercantile construeti on w6rkwas highly desifaoiu&quot;r;&quot;&quot;^rs.r. sbt   kiic  ljwoKi-on  xscprix  crcnyTi   v;..^,. &apos;.USS0d   in  3,1.1    it 8aspects, and a number of ausfSestions had been tb*definite propositions before the Cabinet &quot;/ere reduced tt h e f ol 1 owi tis&apos; -it) That 0\it-of-Work Donation should be continuedto ail civilian workers until March 31, 1920,either on the present scale or, as was more generally favoured, on a reduced scale, whichshould,if possible, be leas than the scale proposed for the permanent scheme ofUnemployment Insurance.     This proposal was based on the belief that it&quot;would be administratively impracticable to limit the Out-of-Work Donation to unemployed workers from Royal Dockyards or other government establishments*or(ii) That the Out-of-&apos;fork Donation for civiliansshould be discontinued altogether, but that,unemployment in the Royal Dockyards should,be safeguarded by suspending discharges,which are now taking place at the totalrate of 800 a week for all the Dockyards&apos;by undertaking certain profitable andadvantageous repair and. refitting workwhich, though important, had, for reasons of economy, been postponed until next year;and,  finally, by insist in&apos;?., as a condition for suspending the discharges, that all themen in the Royal Dockyards should agree tosome system of dropping one or even two days1work a week:   that is to say, to the adoptionof some plan similar to that which prevailsin the Lancashire cotton industry.    It was recognised, as an objection to this scheme,that it would be contrary to the principleadopted by the Finance Committee of theCabinet of reducing Government establish-xaents in the interests of economy as rapidly as possible, and that the plan would hecriticised on the ground that economy hadbeen sacrificed, to giving employment:or(iii) a combination, of (i) and (ii);    that is tosay, a continuance of the Out-of-Work Donation,combined with the scheme for the suspension of discharges from the Dockyards.
d&amp;mJ^ iff existing unemployment werefurther aggravated by discharges from the dockyards.Cd) ThatAfter the question had been discussed, in all its aspects, and a number of suggestions had been made, the definite propositions before the Cabinet were reduced tot h e fol 1 owinsr: -4i) That Out-of-Work Donation should be continuedto all civilian workers until March 31, 1920,either on the present scale or, as was more generally favoured, on a reduced scale, whichshould,if possible, be less than the scale proposed for the permanent scheme ofUnemployment Insurance.     This proposal was based on the belief that it&quot;would be administratively impracticable to limit the Out-of-Work Donation to unemployed workers from Royal Dockyards or other government establishments:or(ii) That the Out-of-Tor &apos;&amp; Donation for civiliansshould be discontinued altogether, but that.unemployment in the Royal Dockyards shouldbe safeguarded by suspending discharges,which are now taking place at the totalrate of 800 a week for all the Dockyards&apos;by undertaking certain profitable andadvantageous repair and refitting workwhich, though important, had, for reasons of economy, been postponed until next year;and, finally, by insisting, as a condition for suspending the discharges, that all themen in the Royal Dockyards should agree tosome system of dropping one or even two days&apos;work a week:    that is to say, to the adoptionof some plan similar to that which prevailsin the Lancashire cotton industry.    It was recognised, as an objection to this scheme,that it .would be contrary to the principleadopted by the Finance Committee of theCabinet of reducing Government establish-ments in the interests of economy as rapidly as possible, and that the plan would be criticised on the ground that economy hadbeen sacrificed to giving employment:or(ill) A combination.of (i) and (ii);   that is tosay, a continuance of the Out-of-^ork Donation,combined with the scheme for the suspension of discharges froaa the Dockyards.
It was recognised, that the arguments for and againsteach of the above schemes were very nearly balanced.    Thedifference of cost between the first two schemes was not so great as might be expected, and. should not in any .eventexceed  1,500,000.    In these circumstances it was agreed  To adjourn further discussion until afterthe Prime Minister, accompanied by theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Firstlord of the Admiralty and. the Minister ofLabour, had seen a Deputation of Membersof Parliament for the Royal Dockyard towns,which was to wait upon him on the following morning.P$DING TRADR.    (6) In the course of the above discussion the attentionfusal of      of the Cabinet -was drawn, to/the fact that the Trades Unionfin to(tease of the building trade was standing in the way of thegership.government&apos;s Housing Scheme by refusing to admit as membersil men discharged unemployed from other trades.It was generally agreed -1 That the Government would be justifiedin resisting this action on the part ofthe Trades *Jnien, and the suggestion was made that the Union should be summoned to meet representatives of the&apos; Governmentin a Public Conference.1, Whitehall Gardens, S.7,1,November 6, 1919.
