THE SPEN VALLEY ELECTION.



Lord Haig&apos;s Letter to Sir John Simon.



(1) The attention of the Cabinet was called to the following letter which had been addressed by Field-Marshall Lord Haig to Sir John Simon, one of the candidates in the Spen Valley Election, and had been published in some of the newspapers of the same day:-



"Dear Sir John Simon, - As you say, I have no wish to enter into political question. Since you write to me, however, that it is being hinted in some quarters in Spen Valley that your services in France were only make-believe and casual, I have no hesitation in saying that your work during the year you spent with the R.A.F. in France was very real and very valuable, both to the particular branch of the service to which you were attached and to the army as a whole".

It was pointed out that this interference in a political election by an officer on the Active List was not only unexampled but created a very serious precedent. It was alleged that Field-Marshal Lord Haig had refused a request by an Agent of Colonel Fairfax, one of Sir John Simon&apos;s opponents in the election, to send a similar letter to his notwithstanding the distinguished services of the latter, who had commanded a battalion, had taken part in the Battle of the Somme, had been gassed, and had been mentioned in despatched. There was a general feeling that the Field-Marshal&apos;s action should be enquired into.

It was further generally agreed that the Government ought not to allow its supporters to suffer detriment from official action of this kind.



Two alternative methods were suggested for securing redress:-



(i) That Colonel Fairfax should write a letter to Field-Marshal Lord Haig formerly demanding a similar statement in regard to him own war services, and that this letter should be published:

(ii) That a Question should be arranged in the



  


House of Commons drawing attention to the Field-Marshal&apos;s letter and making enquiry of the War Office as to what were the services either of both candidates or, alternatively, of Colonel Fairfax only.

In regard to the first alternative it was stated that Colonel Fairfax had already declined to send such a letter. Further, it was pointed out that for him to do so would be to repeat the very undesirable course already taken by Sir John Simon, and to establish the precedent more firmly; also, that Colonel Fairfax&apos;s letter could hardly be published until Field-Marshal Lord Haig&apos;s reply was available; and, as the election takes place on Saturday next, publication would be too late to give him redress.

In regard to the second proposal it was considered undesirable that the services of both candidates should be stated together in reply to a single question, as this might be regarded as reflection on Lord Haig.



The Cabinet agreed -

(a) That Captain Guest should arrange for a Question to be put the same afternoon to the Secretary of State for War, in the following sense:-

"In regard to the published correspondence on the military services rendered by one of the candidates for the Spen Valley, would the War Office supply the House with the record of Colonel Fairfax&apos;s services?".

Captain Guest should also arrange with the War Office to supply the material for the reply, and should endeavour to secure the return of the Secretary of State for War, who was away from London, in time to answer the Question:

(b) That the Secretary of State for War should be invited to consider the expediency of asking Field-Marshal Lord Haig to give him his reasons for writing the letter, with a view to any action which the Secretary of  State or the Army Council might seem appropriate.

 




PROHIBITION OF IMPORTS.

The Powers of the Government Invalidated.

(2) As a matter of urgency, the President of the Board of Trade raised the question of the powers of the Government for the prohibition of imports. He explained to the Cabinet that in issuing, during the War, the numerous Proclamations prohibiting the importation (except under licence) of many classes of goods, the Crown had relied on Section 43 of the Customs Laws Consolidation Act, 1876, which gives the Crown powers by Proclamation to prohibit the importation of arms and munitions, and any other goods. In so doing, the Crown acted on the advice of the Law Officers. Its action was not challenged until very recently; but in the case of The Attorney-General v. Brown, which related to the assure by the Customs of a consignment of goods imported in contravention of a prohibition made by Proclamation under Section 43 of the Act above-mentioned, Mr Justice Santey had decided that the words "and any other goods" must be interpreted ejusdem generis with "arms and action". The effect of this Judgment, unless over-ruled on appeal, was to make the section of the Crown in respect of many of the prohibitions which were in force up to August 22nd. 1st, and the prohibitions still in force, invalid, and deprived the Grown of any legal authority for maintaining any system of prohibition until the necessary legislation was enacted by Parliament. An appeal would immediately be entered, but in the meantime a position of considerable difficulty was created. The prohibition which had been operative since August 22nd. related only to the products of the Key industries scheduled to Part III of the Imports and Exports Regulation Bill, and had been continued pending the passage of that Bill: that is to say they related to the products of those industries which, after careful consideration, the government had decided must he carried on in this country on an adequate scale for the sake of national security.


The following three courses were suggested:-

(i) That the Government should announce that, as the Crown did not accept the decision and were appealing against it, the Customs had been instructed to continue to hold any goods of the scheduled classes imported without licence, and the Government would ask Parliament at a later stage to indemnify the Customs Authorities for such action.

It was very doubtful, however, if this was a practicable policy, since, if legal proceedings were taken by any importer to require the customs to deliver up the goods, there would be no legal defence to such section.

(ii) That Parliament should be asked to pass a short emergency Bill continuing for a limited period the prohibition of importation of the scheduled articles subject to licence, but without any licence fees, such as are contemplated in Part III of the Imports and Exports Regulation Bill.

This course, however, was generally agreed to be impracticable in the present state of Parliamentary business.

(iii) That the decision in The Attorney-General v. Brown should be accepted, and all restrictions abandoned until either the decision is reversed on appeal or the prohibitions are re-imposed under legislation.

This course meant that, for a time, goods which are the products of what are classed as "Key industries" under the Imports and Exports Regulation Bill would came in freely, and no doubt every effort would be made by the foreign producers and their agents, or interested merchants here, to get as large stocks as possible into this country, and in some cases at least would have a disturbing effect on the rising domestic industries concerned. In the case of dyes and chemicals the results would not be serious, and in the classes of goods in which American competition would otherwise be keen the depreciated Exchange would act as a breakwater. On the other hand, on some classes of optical instruments, illuminating glassware and gauges, where the 
ooiapet.it ion was fross France,&apos; Japan and sesae of the neutraleeuntriee, the offset would bo considerable.After sosjo discussion the Cabinet agreed -(a) Phat the heat course would be to announce that the Imports and Exports TvsstulationSit &quot;l  waul A ha mialt&amp;A  anitl4 ** *1 y,ltfat*4rlit-ort(b) Phat this policy should he announced by a; Question placed on the Paper in the erdin-ary way, and by &quot;Answer in&quot;the Bouse ofCoaaaons-,&apos;HEALTH imvmm?,.(%) reference to Cabinet 14 (19), OonelusloJl 9, theUnemployment cabinet had ,bafere them the following? do-ucaente relating toInsuranee.Bealth Insurance:-Memoranda by the  sinister of Health(i-ayers v.^-loO and C,lh-S^vd),Memoranda fey the Chancellor of the fiscshegnee(Supers 0.1.-211 and 0.1&apos;.A MsRxoranduir. by the Sinister of Pensions.(Paper C.F.-S03).$he Pinistsr of habsttr stated that the elcsely rslat-ed Unejsployifijmt Insuranoe Bill would be introduced in theEou.se of Colons and read - for the first titae on Monday nextAfter the scheme l-jad been explained to the Cabinet *the following note was read frets the Chancellor of the71;55chequer, who was unavoidably absents-wp-jkfvt-w-jB the Sahinst &quot;Seeio^ the r*course whieh&quot;aa* yursuo jufi veparo. *o m-ae ^-aew*-w*?eno*&quot;undiir die.0usslor** I ihinx they shouldbe informed that X have ,just learned thatPtisaates will nest year showill,COG,000 overitoiaatxo increase m **.5.4.,vear. whieh itself shows an xn-* le Mi-Sdl wo, alnost wholly automatic,ta the result of the over last year.   &apos;rnxe -Peeent Education hill, which ssakes the&quot;reasurv&quot; contribution follow autossstioaxl
on the expenditure of Local Authorities, who themselves have only a minor interest in  

controlling its amount. In forecasting, future expenditure for the purpose of the White Paper presented to the House I allowed only for an addition of £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 in the &apos;normal year&apos;. Education alone involves us in an expenditure which can only be met by additional taxation, and affords the strongest arguement for refraining from fresh commitments".                                                                               

  Various alternative suggestions were made for reducing the contribution by the State towards National Health Insurance, These included the following:-   

(i) An addition of an extra ½d. to the workers&apos; contribution, which would bring in £1,500,000.

It was pointed out that the unemployment contribution from the workers would be 3½d. An addition of ½d. to the proposed workers&apos; contribution of 5d. to Health Insurance would make a round sum of 9d., which would be easier for the employer to deal with than a total of 8½d, as now proposed. It was explained, however, that the addition of ½d. would he highly inconvenient and probably unworkable from an administrative point of view, as the cards, stamps and accounting system of Health Insurance were all worked out for denominations of 1d.

(ii) The addition of 1d. to the workers contribution.                                        

This would bring it to the same level as was proposed to the employers, and would be a set-off to balance the various block grants which had in the last few years been made by the state. There was a strong feeling that, in view of the rise of wages, an addition of 

1d. would not be unreasonable.

(iii) A proposal, to be considered with (11), that the state contribution should rather be in the direction of relieving the local rates, on which it was proposed to place the maintenance of sanatoria in connection with Health Insurance.

The Cabinet agreed --

That the question of Health Insurance, including the above suggestions, should be referred to a Cabinet Committee composed of the following:-




The Minister of Health,

The Chancellor of the Exchequer,

The Secretary for Scotland,

The Minister of Pensions,

The Secretary of State for India,

The Financial Secretary to the Treasury.

OLD AGE PENSIONS.

(4) With reference to Cabinet 11 (19), Conclusion 1, the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, giving the recommendations of the Cabinet Committee on Old Age Pensions (Paper C.P.299).

There was no criticism of any of the Cabinet Committee&apos;s proposals, and the discussion centred mainly on the question of when the necessary legislation could be passed. Since the proposals of the Cabinet Committee involved an expenditure of some £4,000,000 to £5,000,000 per annum less than the minimum proposals of the Old Age Pensions Committee, it was realised that they would necessarily be exposed to a good deal of criticism, not only from the Labour Party but from the members of the Old Age Pensions Committee. The Cabinet felt that if the measure was postponed until next Session it would be very difficult to secure the adoption of the present proposals. The Cabinet were informed that preliminary enquiries had indicated that Mr Arthur Henderson would welcome what he regarded as an instalment towards increasing Old Age Pensions, and it was possible that the Labour Party might be induced to support a measure based on the Cabinet Committee&apos;s proposals. It was recognised that there would be very strong objections in some question to a suspension of the Standing Rules and the rushing of the measures through Parliament in the present Session. Nevertheless, there was felt to be a possibility that the prospect of accuring a relatively economical measure might weigh with the very Members who otherwise would be most likely to object, on the above grounds, to the passing of the Bill this Session.

Persons withl8s.  a week--will receive a minimum pension of 2s.  a week,bringing their total means up to  1 a week.Any estimates of cost are highly speculative hut theCabinet Committee are advised that this scale will probablybring in about 220,000 new pensioners as compared with350,000 who would he brought in by doubling the existingmeans scale.The saving involved will be about x 4,000,000 oerannum,  possibly? in. the first year rather more.Under this scheme it  is estimated that,  as compared      1with the existing expenditure upon Old Age Pensions,(including the additional allowance of 2s,6d. during the War) jofThese are considered preferable to Is.  steps as involving a less close assessment of means and therefore a less frequent reassessment of pensions when means vary.x This  is based on Sir A, Watson&apos;s estimate that the averagepension under the new scale will be  24.7s.0. per annum,i.e. about 9s.4d. a weeic,  instead of  25&quot;.5s*0.  as estimated by Sir F,  Clarke.     1,000,000 of the saving istherefore due to a reduction of the original estimate ofthe cost of a doubled means limit.
I 23G- 2 -&apos;&apos;c of about  17,650,000 per annum, the- expenditure in future will be about x 28,0O0,O00 per annuls, an increase of ratherover  10,000,000 per annum of which nearly  6,000,000 is duto increasing existing pensions and the balance to bringingon to the Pension list a frosh body of pensioners at the new-higher rate of pension.The Cabinet Committee also recommend for adoption(l)    The proposals  contained in the Minority Report,page 16, with regard to the calculation of means and(2/    The unanimous recommendations of the committee with regard to the Poor Law disqualification,  and tocertain minor alterations in the conditions under whichpensions are at proeent paid.Tho complete scheme to be embodied in legislationmay be summarised, as follows1, The maximum pension will in future be 10s.  a.week as recommended in both Reports.&apos;    The additional allowance of 2c.6d.  a week given by administrative action duringthe Par will be absorbed in the new scale and the administra-tivo concessions with regard to the calculation by means ofexisting pensioners will also be terminated,  subject,  ifnecessary,  to some temporary provision for existing interests.(This last will be a matter for adninistrativo action andnot legislation).Paragraph The argument for this concession id that it will10 of ma-aority Re-    benefit the poorest pensioners who are suffering greatport  (p.9)hardships at present and who have tho strongest  claim if more money is to he spent on Old Age Pensions.2. this is based on Sir A.&quot;WatsonVs estimate that the averagepension under tho new scale will be  24. 7b . 0. per annum,  i,&apos;e.about 9s. 4d. a week   instead of  25. 5s. 0. as&apos; estimated bySir P.Clarke.     1,000,000 of the saving is therefore due to areduction of the original estimate of the cost of a doubledmeans 1 ir.it .
^ 2*   &amp;t the same time the existing poor Law die-qualification will be removed as regards outdoor reliefor the home assistance which will take its place under theparagraphs10 and So Of      recommendations of the Maclean committee.    This will enablemajorityreports assistance to be given from local funds in eases ofspecial need and will obviate any necessity for furtherincreasing the amount of pension at the expense of theExchequer.   Pension will not however be paid to inmatesof poor law and other public institutions except that itmay be continued tc persons entering such institutions inorder to obtain medical or surgical relief for a period notexceeding 3 months in order to prevent the breaking up ofthe home.3,    The means limit will,  as above stated run from 10s.to 18a. a week.    It is estimated that an additional saving of about  1,000,000 per annum would be obtained by reducing the scale so as to run from Ss. to 16s. but it-is felt that a scale which makes it possible for pensioners&apos;means to be brought up to the round sum of  1 a week is onewhich will be so much mere attractive and easily defensiblethat this additional expenditure is worth incurring.The new means limit will go a long way towards meeting the complaints of Friendly Societies and TradeUnions that the thrift of their members is &quot;penalised&quot;.As a rule the permanent sick  pay or pension giver: byPri endly Societies dees not exceed I  - a week.    TradeUnion pensions range from 4/* to 10/* but are almostalways nearer the lower figure.It can be said,  therefore,  that the receipt of these benefits will never in the absence;iM0f other means resultin the reduction of the Old Age Pension.Moreover,  as the Minority point out, when claimantsin receipt of such allowances are residing with friendsor relations,  these allowances are usually paid over towards
cost of&quot; &quot;&quot;board&quot; &quot;ajxdL.io-dbgln^within the limits required to qualify for full pension.The situation will be further eased by the proposedexclusion of temporary sick pay from the calculation cfmeans.The proposals of the Minority with regard tc the calcu-lation of means  (page 16 of the Report)   should he adopted as they stand.    These proposals are designed on the one hand to litigate the grievances felt under the existing system and on the other hand to limit the benefit which will heobtained by persons in possession of comparatively large capital sums.These proposals cannot be clearly explained exceptin the terms of the report itself which are as follows :-&quot;There are contain   further modifications which werecommend should be made in the calculation of means,(l) The adoption of our proposal necessitates theimposition of some restriction on applicants possessed of considerable capital sums.    If no such restrictionwere imposed a single applicant would he eligiblefor the minimum pension if he possessed a capital sum of x l,26o,  or if he were one of a married couple,  a sum of x 2,52o.    It seems to us that thegrant of a pension to such an applicant could notbe defended since it would enable him to preservehis capital intact,  and the pension would therebybenefit not the pensioner himself hut his successors.On the other hand,  we are- ir favour cf a suggestion made in evidence that small amounts deposited by the claimants in the Post office Savings Bank or retained in the house should be ignored in calculating themeans.    Such sums are frequently thus kept at hand to serve for emergencies or for the payment of thefuneral expenses of the pensioner.    We think alsothat as the capital possessed by a pensioner increases in amount a more stringent method of calculating the means from that source should be adopted.    Wetherefore suggest that the yearly value of invest-ments and other property of the claimant whichmay be subject to an assessment on capital valueunder Section 2 (l)  (a)   of the Old Age pensions act,1911,  should be calculated on a sliding scale asfollows,&apos;(a) The first  25 of capital value tc be ignored,(bj The next  375 of capital value to be taken at 5 percent of such value.(o-) Any property in excess of  400 capital value to be taken at 10 per cent as representing roughly its annuity value.(Note.    Xwith the lower means limit suggested these amountswill become  945 and  1,690 respectively).
by the Commit tee *(2)       Although we are in agreement with our colleagues as to the difficulty of giving effect to the eug-suggestions made in evidence in favour af the grant ofpreferential treatment to particular forms of pra-perty or income nevertheless we consider that anattempt might be made to remove some of the smallgrievances which have caused friction in the adminis-tration of the present scheme of bid age pensions.Thus we consider that temporary sick pay or sickness benefit receivable by the applicant (cr the husbandor wife of the applicant), under medical certificatefrom a friendly society,  trade union,  or under theNational insurance Act, 191.1,  for a period notexceeding 3 months in any period of 12 months afterthe allowanoe of a pension^  should not be regardedas income.We consider that this exception is justifiable onthe ground that sickness iti the house adds to theexpense of maintenance, but we do not recommendthat the concession should esver permanent sick pay.Thias in the ease cf the agsds is frequently in thenature of a pension^, and. is more often associatedwith the disability resulting from.eld age itselfrather than with incapacity due te any specificcomplainte(3)       We believe that it is only in exceptional circum-atances at present that furniture and personal effectsent-sr into the calculation of means.   In order teobviate irritation which may arise from an invest!-gation into this item, we think it advisable t^ignore means from this source.(4)       There is one further point in which we considerthe existing Acts require amendment.   Where aclaimant is separated from his wife and an allowance is being paid to her by the claimant under aSeparation order,  there is no provision enabling the allowance to be deducted from the claimant&apos;smean3.    This involves the inclusion of the sum paidIn the means of each of the couple and we considerthat in future it should not be included in themeans of the person actually making the payment.&quot;4,    It is proposed, to adspt the miner and miscellaneousrecommendations contained in paragraph 21 of the majority report.    These cannot with clearness be more briefly summarisedand a copy of the paragraph in question is accordingly appendedbglow.    it should be noted that the recommendations with regardte nationality., imprisonment and failure to work may be a controversial chaaracter and it is open to dopbt whether it isdesirable to reduce the period for which a claimant musthave been a British subject from 20 years to 10 as proposed
&quot;SI.    In addition to our main son erne *f reform there arecertain minor points in which we consider the existing Actsrequire amendment(I) statutory conditions for the receipt .cf a pension(a) Nationality. - We do not feel able to supportThe recommendaticn made to us &quot;by the Board ofPeputies of the British Jews that the nationalitytest should be waived in favour .bf a residencequalification only.   Any privilege granted tounnaturalised aliens could only operate as a dis-ccuragement to naturalisation,  and aliens in thecountry should take the full status of citizen-ship if the authorities think them suitable.We think, however,  that British subjects ofalien birth should become eligible for pension10 years (instead cf 20 years)  after naturalisation-tion, provided that they have been resident inthe United Kingdom for at least 20 years.If the position of the alien is to be furtherimproved, we consider that this should beeffected by arranging reciprocity agreementswithin the League cf Nations under which the vari-cub nationals will become entitled to whateverform of old age pension is in force in theircountry of settlement.We think that the arguments for the exclusion- ef the alien do not apply with the same forcein the case of the British-born wife of an alien,and we recommend that,  if the law of nationalityremains as at present,   the benefits of the pension should be granted to her as though she had never lost her British nationality.(*) Residence. -    Section 3 (2)  of the Act of 1911makes residence in the United Kingdom for 12 outof the last 20 years a condition for the receiptof a pension.    The intention of this Sectionappears to be perfectly clear and we do not eon-sider it unreasonable.    It is, however,  sodrafted that if the period of absence occursnear the pensionable age,  the date of eligibilitybecomes almost indefinitely postponed.    Thus aperson cf pensionable age who over the periodcf 1900 to 1919 had been absent from the UnitedKingdom from 1910 to 1918 would have to wait until 193c before he oould receive a pension,whereas if he had been absent from 1900 to 1908he would become entitled in 1920.   We therefore recommend that the section should be amended to make the period 12 years in the aggregatesince attaining the age of 5c.In this.connection our attention has been drawn to the reciprocal agreement between theDominion of New Zealand and the Commonwealthof Australia with regard to residence, and.wesuggest that legislative sanction be sought tegive effect to similar agreements between theUnited Kingdom and other parts of the Empirewhere Old Age Pensions are granted,  so thatresidence in any one part shall count in any0 &quot;her.
(2)  statutory Disqualifications  :--fa)  Impri sonment. -    We do not consider that theekJLs-ting disqualifications for varying terras afterthe completion of a sentence of imprisonment canbe justified.    Such di^pph-li-fhc-a-tion appears tous to bo in the nature of a double punishment forthe same offence,  which we consider to be wrong in principle.-,   ,        Apart from this it is open to the furtherabjection that it works unevenly in differentcases.The judicial authority does not invariably know that the prisoner is or is likely to become an old age pensioner,  and even where this is known theeffect of the sentence on the pension may not befuily realised.    Again,  it is unfair that an offence which committed at the age of 59 involves no penalty beyond the imprisonment itself,   should at the -age cf 69 involve a loss cf pension inadditi on0We therefore recommend the repeal of Sectionn3  (2)  of the Act of 1908,  and Section 4  (2)  and(3)  of the Act of 1911,   so far as they involve dis-qualification after the period of imprisonment,but we recommend the retention of Section 3(3)  ofthe Act of .1908 in order to prevent payment of the pension to inebriates who are obviously unfittedto be trusted with the pension.(b) Failure to workqua 1 ifieat i on i that it will be better- We understand that this dis-rarely operative,  and we thinkfrankly to abandon it. te^ a claimanti^appiy pn-pionally beforepaininggft of 70.the(c) The disqualification of inmates jf prisonsand pauper or criminal lunatic&apos; asylums shouldcontirnue as at present.(3) Miscellaneous Recommendations  :-(a) De-te of receivjng pension . - Under Section 5(2j  of the&quot;Act of l9o8 aplnsion does not commenceto accrue until the first Friday after the claimhas been allowed by the Committee.    Similarly anincreased pension does not accrue until after thedecision by the Committee.In many cases delay ha3 occurred between thelodging of a claim and the payment of the pension.This delay is often unavoidable and in no wayreflects on the Pension Authorities,  but the hard-ship incurred is none the less real and we recom-mend that each pension should date from the Fridayfollowing the receipt of the application for apension,   or the date on which the person becomesentitled to the pension,  whichever is the later.
Ute^ there-,seeasilHbe no reasonfor excludingthem unless theyare pauperlunatics(b) Claims received on &quot;behalf of persons incapable-&quot;&quot;si understanding- uhe nature of the claim. - Underthe Old A^e pensions Acts there is no express dis-qualifieation of such persons, but the Law officers have advised that claims made by persons mentallyincapable sf understanding their significance oouldUnht be regarded as valid, and the Acts as they nowstand make no prevision for a claim t4 be made byether persons on their behalf.Xhtm reeemmend that the cases ef persons qualified for Old Age pensions (not certified as lunatics)hut as a matter of fact incapable cf understanding the nature of a claim,  should be met by enablingPension Committees to entertain an application bya person ^ejm,x-ed to act as &quot;next Friend&quot; whoseapplication is vouched for by a Magistrate, and is accompanied by the certificate t?f a qualifiedmedical practitioner.(e)      InalienabilityPbfjgension;-   Under Section 8cf the Act ef 190*8^ any charge en the pension isveidy and in the event of the &quot;bankruptcy of apensioner it does not pass far the benefit of the creditors,&quot;We recommend that this prevision should beextended and that the Old&quot;Age Pension be expresslyexcluded from the calculation ef means for thepurpose of an instalment or a committal eirder underthe Debtors Act,  thereby making the pensioninviolable again at any creditors*M5.     a machinery clause is also desirable te enable the Customsto increase an existing pension without having to refer thecase tfci the Lecal pension Committee, reserving ef course theright .ef the pensioner te appeal to the Scmmittee if he isdissatisfied with the pensitn officer&apos;b decision.   This willgreatly expedite matters.Ha thing has been said in this memorandum as te therejected   prapesal sf the majerity for univeral pensions,which is fully, dealt with in the minority report,  or as tothe prcpeeals of individual.members f?r abill further,inor-easing the amount sf pension and for lowering the $uali-fying age.Th^ latter.is dealt with in paragraph 19 of the majority report and it should be asted that they recommend a further enquiry inte the Insurance Acts. It is almost certain that nothing will come of this, and no doubt the G-evernment willnot wish to commit themselves to such an enquiry but it maybe difficult to refuse it.(intd.)
