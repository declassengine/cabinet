(l)    The Cabinet had before them a private letter, eircu-lated by Mr.Balfour, which had been addressed by Lieutenant-Colonel W. Stewart Roddie, of the Inter-Allied Commissionof Control, Berlin, to Sir Aimeric mitzroy,  the Clerk of the privy Council,  on the subject of tho situation in Germany(Paper d.P.-3 2).      The Cabinet were much impressed by this letter, the substance of which was that if Germany was corn-polled to surrender for trial the persons accused of breaches of the laws of war or criminal acts, under Articles  28 and229 of the Treaty of Peace with Germany, nothing couldprevent its collapse.Lieutenant-general Heill Malbolm,   just returned fromGermany, was ^resent during this discussion, and was qu.es-tioned as to his view of Colonel Poddie&apos;3 letter.      In replyto various question,  General Malcolm stated that Herr Poskewas apt to talk In somewhat exaggerated terms, especially ata first meeting.      Herr Poske&apos;s remarks, as described in theletter, were not quite a fair  judicial statement of the case,and were somewhat over-coloured.    In his own view, the fate of the German Government would depend on the numbers askedfor and the nature of the charges against them.    In reply tothe Prime Minister he said that if the charges were not somuch in respect of acts committed in the course of the Warbut rather in respect of acts of inhumanity, offences againstwomen, prisoners,  etc.,  their difficulties would be less.He asked to emphasize the importance of securing a fairtrial of the accused in all countries, as the Germans wouldhave no confidence in a French or Belgian Court.The suggestion was made that the number of personsdemanded should be cut down on these lines.    It was pointedout that the greet object of these Articles in the Treaty ofPeace with Germany was their moral effect.      To produce this effect a very small list was sufficient.It was generally agreed that If a very long list was put in there would be a real danger of bringing down thepresent German Government.It
It was agreed(a) That the Lord Chancellor and the attorney-General should accompany the Prime Minister to Paris for theforthcoming Conference of the Headsof States ( the date of which is notret fixed), and that they should present to the Conference the viewof the British Cabinet, namely, thatthe list should be cut down,  and only such flagrant offences should be in-cluded as the German Government wouldnot be disposed to dispute:(b) That,  in the meanwhile,. the Lord Chan-cellor should consider with the Attorney-General whether anything could be done to ensure a fair trial for the accusedpersons, in whatever country theywere tried.(2)    With reference to Cabinet 2 (19), Appendix (Minute 5)the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Pood Con-troller suggesting that, in order to meet certain diffi-culties caused by the extravagant price being paid forprompt sugar in America, there should be a temporary reduc-tion of the domestic sugar ration from 8 oz. to 6 oa.(paper cp.-320) .The proposal was criticised on the ground that toreduce the ration to private consumers when almost unlimitedquantities of sweetstuihfs were being sold would create avery bad political effect.      Even though the effect of cutting down the ration to manufacturers might be relatively small, it was suggested that from a political point of viewsuch action should accompany a reduction of the domesticration.On the other hand,  it was pointed out that the effectof cutting down the manufacturers&apos;  supplies would be tocreate unemployment,  and that this would have an even worsepolitical effect then cutting down the domestic ration.Further, it was urged that certain trades, including the mineral waters trade (which is building up a considerableexport trade, particularly since the adoption of prohibitionin North Imeriea) and the dye industry, would be severelyhandicapped by the curtailment of the sugar ration.
The Csbinst agreed  To approve the proposal of the Pood Con-troiler, to cut down the domestic sugar ration.The food Controller undertook to limit the curtailment as far as possible.THE census of 19 SO.(Z)       The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Health, proposing (i) that instead of passinga special Act for each separate Census, a permanent CensusAct should be passed, conferring powers generally in rele-tion to the taking of the censuses;    and (ii) that the Billshould empower a census to be taken quincuennially (paper cp.-309) .The Cabinet approved the principle of a permanentCensus Act, but in view of the heavy cost of a census theywere net prepared at the present time to agree to a quin-quennial census.The Cabinet agreedThat the Ministry of Health should prepare a Bill with a view to a permanent Census Actconferring powers generally in relation tothe taking of censuses, which should be examined by the Home Affairs Committee.The question of a quinquennial censuswas reserved.SUPPLY OP TEESOVIET S0V-*3RM1ENT OP30,000 TONSOF SURPLUSAMERICAN?0OLhExchange ofPrisoners-with theSoviet[Government.(4)       The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to a tele-gram from the Poreiga Office (No.1584 of December 19,1919)to the British Minister at Copenhagen, suggesting certain concessions which the Government might be prepared to con-sider in connection with Mr,0&apos;Grady&apos;s renewed negotiationswith M. litvinoff on the subject of the exchange of prisonersof war with the Soviet Government..     The particular item towhich the attention of the Cabinet was drawn.was the possiblesupply to the Soviet Government of 30,000 tons of surplusAmerican food now lying at Vyborg,, which have been left over from food originally shipped for relief purposes, togetherwith a few surplus supplies still in this country.The Secretary of State for War stated that he had asked that this question might be placed on the agenda, but
FUTURE cabinet business.ForthcomingInter-allied conference.The Territori-al Army.Turkey,he hod since received a letter on the subject from theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and he would       *therefore ask that the subject might be held over for thepresent.(5)      The Cabinet had a short discussion on the subjectof the Christmas Kecess and. future business.Attention was drawn to the fact that the questionof the Territorial Force must be settled before January14th., 1920, as on that date there would be a meeting ofall the Territorial Force Associations, when the Government&apos;decision would have to be announced.The Secretary of State for War stated that he wasabout to circulate his proposals.It was recognised that the future business of theCabinet was closely connected with the date of the forth-coming Conference of Heads of States in Paris.    In thisconnection the Prime Minister stated that he had receivedfrom Signer Bitti a telegram to the effect that he was prepared to come to London immediately after Christmas,&amp; n &amp; s Uggesting that he and the Prime Minister should then proceed to Peris together.     Before the Prime Ministerleft for Paris it was important that the Cabinet&apos; should discuss the question of Turkey, and in this connection it was hoped that the results of Lord Curzon&apos;s conver-sations with M.be?the lot would be circulated in the interval.It was agreed(a) That the Prime Minister should reply to signor Nitti in the sense that he wouldbe glad to meet him during the week com-mencing Sunday,  January 4, 19 20: &apos;(b) That the next meeting of the cabinet should also be held in the week com-mencing- Sunday,  January 4.( 6)  BE-CONTROL
(6j    With reference to War Cabinet 582, Minute 1,  theattention of the Cabinet was drawn to the urgency of adecision on the question of the de-control of all dairy products.      In this connection the Prime Minister saidthat he had that morning received a Deputation of Mayorsof London Boroughs.      The Labour Mayors had wished theGovernment to subsidise milk, but he had replied thatthis was impossible.     He had then suggested that milkshould, be de-controlled.     He was informed that the resultof this would be a fall in the price of milk but a greatrise in the price of home-produced butter, which might reach 6s.6d. a pound.The Cabinet agreed --That a Cabinet Committee,  composed asfollows:-  -The President of the Board ofEducation (in tho Chair)The President, of the Board ofAgriculture &amp; Fisheries,The Pood Controller,The Minister of Health,The Secretary for Scotland,Mr.T.Jones (Secretary),should meet the same afternoon at 3 p.m.with authority from the Cabinet to takea decision on this subject.(7)    With reference to War Cabinet 634, Minute 6, theCabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (Paper CP.-267) calling the attention of theCabinet to a recommendation he had received from theLondon Traffic Advisory Committee that the permanentCenotaph should be erected elsewhere than in Whitehall,owing to the danger of accidents and Interference withtraffic.     They also had before them a letter from theOffice of Works to the Secretary of the Cabinet, stronglyurging, on behalf of the First Commissioner of Works,that the previous decision should be adhered to.There was a strong and general feeling in favourof
Education ofthe public in regard toGovernmentPolicy.NATIONALISATION.        (8) The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to thevery serious propaganda being carried out by the miners in favour of nationalisation.      It was stated that theMiners&apos; Federation were advooating a General Electionon the subject during the forthcoming year,  failing whichthey would resort to direct action.      It was furtherstated that the movement in favour of nationalisationhad been strengthened by several circumstances.      Forexample, in Lancashire the recent sales of cotton mills,at priced, from three to six times the original capital value, had created a disturbing effect.     Hitherto inLancashire it had been the practice for the operativesnot to demand increased wages until the proprietor hadpaid 5 per oent on his capital, and the question no war&amp;se as to whether they were first to earn 5 per cent,on the inflated capital.     Some of the steadiest peoplethought that nationalisation was the only solution ofthis difficulty.In regard to ooal, it was pointed out that the mine-owners themselves were resisting all control.    Theremoval of control would involve a very heavy rise inthe price of coal, or else the closing of half the collieries, and the Government could not possibly consent to it.As regards the railways also it was pointed outthat there was a tendency on the part of the management to get rid of ell control, which was inconsistent v/with the policy adopted by the Government.All these circumstances tended to strengthen themovementrif erecting the permanent Cenotaph on the site of thepresent temporary monument, and it was agreed  That the previous dea-tsion should be sadhered to.A general desire was expressed that the permanentCenotaph should be in all respects a replica of theexisting temporary monument.
MR.BARNES&apos; (9) The Prime Minister, on behalf of the Cabinet,RETURN..offered a welcome to Mr.Barnes on his return from theInternational Labour Conference at &quot;Washington,  togethertheWithalhanks and congratulations of the Cabinet on thesuccess he had achieved in circumstances of exceptional*difficulty.*     o     *2f Whitehall Gardens, S.W.December 23, 1919.movement In favour of nationalisation.  It was pointed out that the Government itself was doing, very little to place the other side of the question before the public.The Cabinet agreed  That the Minister cf Labour&apos; should place himself in communication with,  and make representations to, Lord Birkenhead&apos;sCommittee, which had been set up for theeducation of public opiniou in regard toGovernment policy ( War Cabinet 634 A.,Minute 2).
