NKMPLOYldSNT (l) With, ref ereric-e-&quot;tir the... statement recorded, in Cabinet15 (19), Conclusion 3, that the Unemployment...Insurance bill would be introduced in the house  of Commons on Monday next,attention was drawn to the fact that this Bill had not-yetbeen circulated to members of the Cabinet, in accordance withthe precedent usually followed in the case of important Bills,and had not  been examined either by the Cabinet itself orby the home Affairs Committee,    It was further stated thatthe Treasury were not fully informed as to the financialeffects of the Bill, more especially in regard to proposalsfor segregating,for purposes of Unemployment Insurance,ce &quot;tain branches of industry it was explained, however, that the scheme had beendiscussed for some months between the Ministry of Labour andthe Treasury,  and had also been examined by the government actuary.      Moreover,  the only changes made since cabinet approval was given to the general lines of the scheme during,the discussions on Out-of-Work Donation,  had been in thedirection of reducing expenditure:    for example, by omittingAgriculture and Domestic Service, and by the adoption ofrates of benefit,  15/- a week for men and 1?,/- a week forwomen,  in lieu of the 20/- for men. and 15/- for womenoriginally aimed at.The suggestion was made that,  instead of introducing the Bill on Monday, which would to some extent commit 4heGovernment in ....alters of detail,  it would be wiser to follow the precedent of fhe Government cf Ireland Bill,  a statementof the main principles of the Bill being made in parliament by the Minister of Labour.In this connection it was explained that the reasonfor introducing the Bill on Monday was that Parliamentstrongly resented the announcement of important measuresbeinf made outside, and it was thought to be only due tothe dignity of Parliament that the Bill should be read a first time in the House of Commons before it was discussed with the various organisations concerned.
ALL PILLS TO (2) With a&apos;view to the co-ordination of the work of theBE CIRCULATEDTC THP CABINPT. various Departments, it was generally agreed  That, even in eases where the cabinet have already approved the rreno &quot;alprinciples,  Bills should be circulatedto the Cabinet sufficiently lon^ beforet. he i r int ? 0duct ion in Pa r 1 ia;ne nt 10enable the:m to he exam.ined before theyare r* e a d a f i r s t t ime .It was generally felt, however, that if the main headsof the policy were first announced in the House of Commons,little objection would be felt in Parliament to the discua-sion of details outside with the interests concerned.    Itwas suggested that the point 9 on which Parlia rent would wishto be informed -&quot;ere:-   the amount of the contribution to beoeid by workers, by employers and by the State respectively:the amount   of the benefits;    and who would be included.There was general agreement that the UnemploymentInsurance Dill should be pushed on as fast as pose ibis, butin present circumstances the following course was agreedto:-(a) That the hill should not be introducedthis Session:(b) That the Minister of Labour should oir-culate to the Cabinet a draft of thestatement he proposed to sake in Parlia-ment, and that this statement shouldnot be discussed before he made it unless this was specially desired by some memberof the Cabinet.
furnished by the various Government Departments (Paper o.p.-314).The draft was examined in detail,  and very consider-able alterations were made.    It was generally agreed thatthe portions dealing with Labour required re-drafting inorder to set forth with greater emphasis the substantial improvement in labour conditions which had been introduced by legislation enacted during ^he present Sessier, of Par-1lament.The attention of the Minister of Labourand Mr Philip Kerr was specially directed to the paragraph   in question.It was generally agreed also that  the latter partof the draft  &quot;required considerable re-arrangement,  and thatthis should be on the following lines:-    The paragraphdealing with the grave economic position of a large part ofEurope to be followed by a paragraph dealing with the costof living;    after which should come passages dealing withex-Service men, Pensioners, disabled Soldiers, Provisionfo&quot; training soldiers and settling them on the land.    these should be followed by paragraphs dealing with the principalheads of legislation,  e.g.,  Labour,  Housing,  Land Acquisition,Health, Transport,  Electricity, Agricultural Policy andRe-organisatifn, and an &quot;omnibus&quot; clause dealing, with other legislation.It was agreed  That a Committee, ctmposed as foilcws:-Mr Dalfour (in the Chair),The Minister of Labour,The Minister of Health,The Secretary of State for India,should meet at 3--t5 p.m. in Mr EalfourhsRoom at the House of Commons, with full authority from the Cabinet to re-draft the King&apos;s Speech on the above lines,and to complete it in time to be submit-ted to the King the same evening.(3) &quot;Tith-Tef^TrBTO^d^i)abdjaet 12- (19), Cfincl-U-sion 1, theCabinet had before them a preliminary draft of the King&apos;aGoeeoh on the Prorogation of parliament, based on material
jias aOVPRNHBNT     (4) ^ith. reference to Cabinet 14 (19), Conclusion 1, the__ Cabinet bad a preliminary- discussion., on tlxe statement to be: Primelister&apos;s       cade by the Prime Minister, who wished to consult hisV, Hatr^ent.colleagues on several points.Composition (5) With reference to Cabinet 14 (19),  Conclusion S, theijf * he &apos;Torth-Lrr. Parlia- Prime Minister stated that he and some of his colleagues hadjient  Lister or the sa-r-e morning held a long conference with Sir James Craig,theSixbounties? who had again expressed his strong opinion in favour ofconfining the Northern Parliament of Ireland te the six counties.    Sir James had also expressed himself strongly infavou- of the proposed Boundary Commission in order to define the precise boundary of the Parliamentary Area.    Sir james craig was not pressing for the exclusion of the Six Countiesfrom the scheme,  and was prepared to try and work the Uorth-err, Parliament in the Six Counties.There followed a long discussion,  in the course ofwhich the aron?*5cnt3 on both sides of the question, as record-cd in the Conclusions of previous discussions on this sub-ject, were repeated.It was strongly urged that if the ultimate aim of theGovernment&apos;s policy was a united Ireland,  it would he better that the  jurisdiction of the Northern-Parliament should extendover the whole of Ulster, which included both Roman Catho-lias and Pro* eslants, both urban and rural districts, andby its size was more suited to possess a separate Parliament.This course, it&apos;was recalled, had been previously adoptedby the Cabinet after several prolonged discussions.On the other hand, it was pointed out, by referenceto Cabinet 12 (19), Conclusion &quot;12, that the previous deoi-sion had been provisional and &quot;subject to possible furtherconsideration in the light of anything that the UlsterMembers might have to say when seen (as proposed) by membersof the Government&quot;.While it was recognised that,  on merits, there was much, to be said for the previous provisional decision,  and
that the Jurisdiction cf the Nort2iarn....parliament over thewhole of Ulster as a geographical unit was more logicaland in many ways easier to defend in Parliament,  it was generally felt that it was even mo-e important to set ascheme which,  even thouerh theoretically less perfect, would- -set with mo**e general acceptance.    It was contended that even the eventual unity of Ireland mould be better assuradby a sehe .e which was ?.ceeptable to those  -ho had to work it.    Few Constitutions, it was pointed out, were theoretical-ly oe&quot;feet;  least of all that of the United Kingdom, althoughit was well suited to the temperament of the people.   A schemewhich was advocated both by Sir Jamc s Craig, a representativeUlsterman,  and Sir J. 0&apos;Connor, who could speak for theIrish hierarchy, would be likely to meet with a better recep-tion than one which they both condemned.    It would be dlffi-cult fo&quot; the Government to force through a scheme which wagunacceptable both to their f-lends and to their critics.In these circumstances,  the Cabinet agreed  That the Prime Minister should explain toParliament the following courses which were open:(i) To apply the jurisdiction of theNorthern Parliament to the wholeof Ulster:(ii) To apply it only to the Six Counties:(lii) To apply It to the Six Counties andto   .ave a Boundary Commission to draw the exact line of dem-rcation witha view to the inclusion of Protestantand Roman Catholic communities livingnear the border within the jurisdiction of the ho rt hem or Southern Parliamentrespectively .Up should further state that the Governmentw*r.e inclined * o lean towards the Six Countiessolution, but were prepared fo conside&quot;favourably the appointment of a boundary commission if generally desired.&quot;oposedtaediat enindarybmissicn.(6) During the previous discussion a proposal was made,which met with considerable favour, to appoint a foundaryCommission immediately in order to advise *he Government ato the precise boundary to be included in the Bill.
it was pointed out, however, that the enquiries ofthe Boundary Commission might produce considerable unrestat the present time,  and that the Bill could be perfectlyrwell dra^n so as to o-provide for the subsequent determination of the b ounda ry .The proposal was not pressed to a finalde cision.(At thhs point the Prime Minister withdrewand Mr Balfour took the Chair.)Ihe Renresen-       (7) nith reference to Cabinet IB (19), Conclusion 11, the at ton o^ I^e-and in the     Cabinet was informed that the Cabinet Committee on Ireland,-louse of Commons.after further discussion and examination, had come to theconclusion that the 42, Irish Members,which the Cabinet had agreed should be provided for in the Bill, should be in theImperial Parliament, for all purposes,  and not,  as decided bythe Cabinet,   &quot;in-and-out&quot;.The new reason which had influenced the Cabinet Commit-tee in making this recommendation was that,if the &quot;in-and-out&quot;portion of the clause were retained, no Irish Member wouldbe aole to serve as a Minister of the Crown.    The Committeewere also profoundly impressed with the great difficulty which governments would, encounter as regards their majority in theHouse of Commons.    This majority would vary materially in asingle afternoon according as *he Irish Members were &quot;in&quot; or&quot;out&quot;.This fresh recommendation of the Cabinet Committee saverise to considerable discussion,  in the course of which thevarious reasons for and against the &quot;in-and-cut&quot; clause,  as recorded in the previous discussion on the subject, wererepeated,  and gave rise to some further discussion as to theproper number of Irish Members.In this latter connection a fresh argument adducedagainst reducing the numbers was that, as the Imperial Parlia-ment would be in a position to impose conscription on ireland as &quot;-ell as on Great Britain, the Irish would have a grievanceif thev were no   full&quot;  represented.    It was pointed out,
however,  that the name applied to the question of Peace or&quot;ar, which remained in the hands of the Imperial Parliament,and that the question of compulsory military service was really only a part  of that larger question.After so ;e discussion the 0abinat agreed  To accent the recommendation of *heCabinet Committee that the number of irish &apos;...embers included in the Pillshould be 43 for all purposes.Excise. The Analotryof a State&apos;in theAmericanUnion:Cnes itapply to theficrthern andthe southern parliament s,(m only to apossiblejr i s h Pa v-I lament ?I(3)     The Secretary was ashed tf request thePrime Minister not to.include in his statement any mention of Excise.(9) With, reference to Cabinet IP (19),  Conclusion 13,  the mention of Excise gave rise to a discussion as to how thePrime Minister in his statement should refer to the analogybetween the powers it was proposed to give to Ireland underthe Government of Ireland Bill and the powers of a State inthe American Union.There was no disposition to question the desirability,from the point of view of its  effect in the Dominions and inthe United States of America,  of mentioning thisanalogy, but doubts were expressed as to how far it was intended to extend:    was it meant to apply to the separateParliaments or Southern and Porthern Ireland, or only to asingle Irish Parliament, the achievraent of which, with theconsent of the two Parliaments, was provided for in the Bill?It wafp recalled that the proposal had first been  :en-tioned only in connection with the financial provisions ofthe Pill.    At that time it had been proposed to withhold thepower to levy Income Tax until a single Irish Parliament was established:    but since then it had been proposed that this power,  as well as other extended powers,   should be granted tothe Porthern and Southern Parliaments, which broucht their powers much nearer than had originally been contemplated tothose of an American State.It was suggested that,  in these circumstances,, it wouldbe inadvisable at this stare to encourage the expectation
that services such as Excise, the .Post Ofhfrice and InlandTelegraphs should -eventually be transferred to a singleIrish Parliament.    The addition of these services would rrivethe proposed Irish Parliament powers in excess of thosewielded by a State in the American Union.    If the argument infavour of making the powers of these Parliaments equivalentto those of a State in the Union could be used for extending the powers,  it could also he used in the opposite way, againstproviding powers for the Irish Parliament in excess of thoseof an Amp^iean State.    If the powers referred to were confer-red on the Irish Parliament,   its powers would mo**e nearly ap-proach to those of a Dominion, and Dominion Home Rule had never been contemplated.On the other hand, it was urged that the omission ofthese powers would weaken the hill and. would remove much ofthe incentive towards a single Parliament.It was suggested that the statement should be on thelines that there had been a clear-cut issue between givingIreland the powers of a Dominion and the powers of a State inthe American Union.    The Government had decided on the latter.So far as it was consistent with the conditions  of the UnitedKingdom, this latter principle would he applied.    Icelandwould get some of those powers now, and,  if the two Parliamentsagreed to set up a single Pa111 lament, would get more.It was suggested that there was no necessity at thisstage to state exactly what those additional powers would beWhile it was recognised that a final decision could notbe * aken in the absence of the Prime Minister, the secretary was asked to record the following general view -(a) That the Prime Minister&apos;s speech shouldbroadly represent what was included inthe Bill:(b) That it was undesirable at present to commit the Government either for or against the inclusion in the Bill ofthe srant to the Irish Parliament ofcowers in resard to Excise, Poat Officeand Telegraphs:
(a) That the Prime Minister should be askedto discuss the question with the Minister! of Education.((NOTE BY THE SECRETARY.    The gist  of this discussion was reported after the meeting to the Prime Minister, who decided to holda  further meeting on Monday next, December2.2,   1919,  at  12, Noon. )IaLTK INSURANCE.(10) With reference to Cabinet 15 (19),  Conclusion 3,  theCabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Minister of health on the question of national Health Insurance (Paper C.P.-316),explaining that it had been foxmd impossible to reach agreement among the members of the Cabinet Committee which had been con-sidering the proposals to amend the Health Insurance Act.The Minister of Health stated that it was of great urgency that he should be in a position to make a statementaa to the intentions of the Government  on the subject beforethe house rose,  and that this involved conferences with someof the interested parties.The Gabinet agreed that  The question should be left for the decisionof *he Prime Minister, in conference with theCabinet Committee, namely the Minister of Health,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary for Scotland,The Minister of Pensions,The Secretary of State for India,The Financial Secretary of the Treasury,who should,  if necessary, meet the AdvisoryCouncil of the Insurance Societies and therepresentatives of the medical profession.2, Whitehall Ga-dena,  S.W.1,December 19,  1919.
