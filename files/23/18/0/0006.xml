RUSSIAN POLICY and THE MAINTENANCE OF BRITISH NAVAL FORCES IN THE BALTIC.

(1) The Cabinet remitted the question of general policy towards Russia, and the maintenance of a British Naval Force in the Baltic, to a special Conference to be held at 10, Downing Street, in the evening, which would be attended by Naval and Military experts as well as it the members of the Cabinet who had usually been invited to join the War Cabinet in the discussion of Russian questions.

IRELAND

(2) The Cabinet had before them the following Papers in regard to Ireland:-

The First Report of the Cabinet Committee on the Irish Question (Paper C.P.-56),

Letters from Viscount Gray of Falloden to the Prime Minister, dated October 5th. (Paper G.T.-8387) and October 17th. (Paper C.P.-89).

The Report of the Committee was subjected to criticism on the following grounds:-

Ulster has hitherto always taken the standpoint that its citizens were entitled to be in all respects on the same footing as citizens of Great Britain, and under this scheme they could be subject to a different r√©gime.

The Scheme gives to the three Southern Provinces of Ireland rather less than they would obtain under the Home Rule Act, and is therefore not likely to be acceptable to them.

It would be difficult for the Irish Government to administer the country effectively without control of the Police; and, conversely, it would be difficult for the Government of Great Britain, which controlled the Police, to govern the country when it did not control the greater part of the Executive Government.

It would inflict hardship on the loyalists in the South of Ireland, who had made as great sacrifices in the War as any part of the Empire.

The feeling in the three Southern Provinces of Ireland was overwhelminingly in favour of Sinn Fein, and none but Sinn Feiners would be elected to the new Parliament. If they were elected their first action would be to declare themselves an independent Republic, unless this was provided against in some way in the Hill.




It was generally recognised, however, that these objections applied to any scheme of Home Rule for Ireland, and that the results of a mere repeal or postponement of the Home Rule Act might be open to greater objections, and would in any event probably not be acceptable to Parliament. Further, it was recognised that, from the point of view of our relations with the Dominious and the United States of America, a mere repeal or postponement would be very undesirable. In view of the specific pledges given to Lord Crey on his appointment as British Ambassador at Washington, this course was considered to be out of the question.

An alternative plan was suggested, based on the contention that the union of Great Britain and Ireland was far more to the advantage of Ireland than to that of Great Britain. Under this scheme the three Southern Provinces of Ireland would, by Act of Parliament, be cut off from the United Kingdom after a certain date, unless before that date they had by plebiscite declared in favour of the union. This scheme did not meet with support. The principal reason urged against it was that an Ireland which, in time of war, could remain a neutral, might, owing to its geographical position and its consequent importance to our Naval Defence,  prove a great danger to the British Empire. Further, even though it adopted an attitude which Great Britain did not regard as consistent with neutrality, it might be supported in this attitude by other neutral Powers, including the United States of America.

It was generally agreed that the best method of Parliamentary procedure in regard to a Home Rule Bill would be for the Government to move resolutions in Parliament embodying its main provisions, although, before the resolutions were adopted, the scheme - and especially its financial provisions - ought to be worked out in the form
