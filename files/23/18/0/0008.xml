HOUSING POLICY.    (1) The Cabinet had before then the following documents on the subject of Housing Policy:-Three Memoranda by the Sinister of Health(Papers G.T.-8015, C.P.-3 and CP.-94),A Memorandum! by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(Pager CP.-73),a Memorandum by the First Commissioner of Works(Paper O.im-10?).In addition, they had before them documents on thefollowing special aspects of the Housing problem:-W &amp;mvM.,Q f ....iabpur.A Memorandum by the Minister of labour(Paper G.T.-813&amp;)-,.A Memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland(Baper Q,T.-8181).(b) ffag,es.....and Profits.A Memorandum by the Minister of Labour(Paper CT.-8S7&amp;),Memoranda by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(Papere 0 .?.-8354 and CP,-74),Two Memoranda by the First Commissioner of Works(Papers G.T.-82.48 and C * P.-116),A Memorandum by the Minister of Pensions(Pa p e r G * T * - 819 4).It was reported to the Cabinet that a Debate on thesubject had taken place on the previous afternoon in theHouse of lords, in the course of which it had been alleged that the Government scheme had broken down.    The impressioncaused by this allegation had been strengthened by the withholding of figures by the Government spokesman.Attention had .been drawn to the tacit understanding which exists between men and masters in the building trade for maintaining the present congestion and high, prices by thepayment of excessive wages and the refusal of any form ofdilution of labour.    The suggestion had been made that aConference should be held between the Government, themunicipalities, the builders and the workmen, which shouldbe addressed by the Prime Minister or some other Ministerand at which the extent to which the present housing
difficulty is attributable to labour causes should be emphasised,The Cabinet generally agreed that some immediate action was necessary to stimulate and increase the outputof houses.   In England, up to November 8th. only 43,2.99houses had been approved as compared with at least 500,000required.   The local authorities in England had, in manyoases, whether from inertia, inexperience, inability to raisethe necessary funds, or other causes, not proved equal tothe task.    It was stated, however, that the position inScotland as regards the local authorities was more sat is-factory.In the course of a very full discussion, a number of proposals were made, among which the following are the moreimportant.,TKB Fits? proposal, was one for stimulating buildingby private enterprise.   Although, before the War, schemesfor no less than sco,000 houses are alleged to have been planned and actually laid out, on the ground, no progress isbeing made with them.   This is said to be due to the factthat in present conditions they cannot be continued withprospects of a reasonable profit.   Present prices are abnor-mally high, but in a few years&apos; time, when the schemes are completed, prices may be expected to have fallen, and pur-chasers would then not be willing to pay a price based onthe actual coat.    Similar causes are deterring private enter-prise in building, not only in urban but equally in rural districts all over the country.   The proposal was to induceprivate enterprise to start again by means of a State subsidyequal in amount to the anticipated economic loss.   For exam-pie, the sum of, say,  150 might be offered for every housebuilt, whether to private builders, Workmen&apos;s building societies, Local Authorities, or landlords;   but the offer
would only hold good for a few years, when the amount of,thesubsidy would be reviewed.She advantages claimed for this scheme were that thegrant of this subsidy would enable the industry to obtainadvances from Banks and. Building Societies, and thus thewhole machinery of private enterprise in building would bere-started.   If a profit were made on the earlier tranaao-tions, the whole trade would enter the scheme.   Sooner or later, if housing was to be continued, it was essential to start private enterprise, and the sooner the better.   Thespecial advantage from the point of view of the State wasthat both the State and the Local Authorities would escape the difficult task of selling or letting house3 and collect-ing rents, for which they have no suitable machinery or experience.    It would be better to hand, this over to personawho were accustomed to make their living by it.   After a fewyears the State would be released from all responsibility inthe matter,   A variant of the scheme was that the localAuthorities should lay out the schemes, for which they are well equipped, and should then dispose of them with the aid of the subsidy to local enterprise.The principal objections urged against this proposal were:   firstly, that this was a reversion to the systems ofprivate enterprise which had actually broken down before theWar.    secondly, that the recent Elections had resulted infilling the municipalities with. Labour members, who wouldresolutely refuse to hand over their schesses to privateenterprise,,   They would state that the private builders couldonly produce the houses mere cheaply because they built acheaper type of house than was permitted to the Local Author!-ties.   Thirdly, that if the private builders were subsidised -they would put all their energy into these schemes and would refuse to tender for the schemes of the Local Authorities,
which would consequently betsterilised.    Fourthly, doubt -as to whether it was Justifiable for the State to financethis scheme in addition to the Government scheme, owing tothe reluctance of the public to subscribe to Government Loanswhile expenditure was increasing.It was generally agreed that the present housing scheme, which had been approved by Parliament, must not be thrown over.   It had been adopted at a time when there wasno possibility of stimulating private enterprise in themanner now proposed.    In fact, it was recalled that Earlia-ment had refused to agree t.o a scheme of subsidy.    Consider-able progress had been made with the present Housing Scheme,even though this progress was. not adequate to present needs,and it would not he fair to those Local Authorities who had pressed on with the scheme to throw it over.    Consequentlythis- proposal, if adopted, must be used to supplement and notto supersede the existing Scheme.THE SECOND PROPOSAL related to new methods of con-struction.The Cabinet heard from Sir James Garmichael an accountof some 12 to 14 new methods of building which were underthe examination of a Special Committee of the Ministry ofHealth.   These included, various proposals for steel-framehouses, hollo?; brisks, hollow concrete blocks, slabs, woodenhouses, mud houses, etc.   One of the advantages of these schemes was that to a considerable extent they could he carried out by a different class of labour from that employ-ed in houses of the normal type.   Thus, in. .cases wherebuilding schemes were held up through the unwillingness ofthe Trades Onions to admit members from outside, or to allowdilution, a different sort of labour could be employed.Further, when the provision of houses had restored a normalrequirement of labour, the steel workers and other special-4-
forms of labour could, be re-absorbed into the labour marketjoore readily than would be the case by increasing the numbersengaged in the regular-housing industry.    Come of these schemes were particularly adapted to rural housing.The principal criticism of this proposal was thatthe labour engaged, in making concrete blocks was alreadywithin the Puildlnj? Trades Union&quot;.THK THIRD PROPOSAL was made with the object ofovercoming the difficulties caused by the Trades Unions.This proposal, which was similar to that made on the pre-vious evening in the House of Lords, was that the PriiaeMinister should summon a Conference of the persons inter-ested in the Housing Scheme, namely - The Local Authorities,The Employers, andThe Trades Unions,and in the&apos;most public manner should impress upon them theresponsibility which lay with them in regard to the provisionof housing accommodation.    It was generally felt that nothing but of off *mre of public opinion would induce the building,trade to take up a more reasonable attitude.THE FOURTH PROPCSAL was that the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries should, co-operate with the Ministry of health in carrying out the building schemes in local areas adjacent to the board&apos;s own estates,    The Board could use its special experience and expert knowledge to stimulate the veryinadequate provision of houses in rural districts, whichwas discouraging the farmers and creating great unrest amongstex-Service men, to many of whom undertakings had been given that houses would be built.THE FIFTH PROPOSAL, or group of proposals, related tothe financing of the building operations.It was alleged that many of the Local authorities had not been able to raise the necessary funds to carry out
the Government Scheme of Housing, and the suggestion was made that the eyetea jaight he adopted of raising money on the.credit of the counties or districts concerned.The Cabinet decided  -(a) That a Cabinet Committee, composed asfollows;-The Minister of Health (in the Chair),The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The President of the Board of Agriculture,The Secretary for Scotland.,The Paym as t e r-G e n s ral,The Minister of Munitions, or Mr Xellaway,The Minister of Pensions,The First Cosxmissioner of Works,The Minister of Labour,with the following experts in permanent  .at t s ndanoe;-Sir James Garmichael,An Pxoert of the&apos;  Ministry of Transport,withKr K.R,Bavies as representing theprime lain! st er,Mr T. Jones (Secretary),should, meat to examine these schemes andreport their proposals to the Cabinet assoon as poss ible.The first meeting was arranged, to takeplace at the Ministry of Health at 3 p.m.on the same afternoon,(b) That the Chancellor&apos; of the Exchequer shouldS&quot;   have discretion, if he considered it desir-able, to assemble a Special Sub-Coia&amp;itteeto consider the financing of the HousingSchemes.REST FOR SmALL (3) The Cabinet had before them the following documentsHOLDINGS.on the subject of Pent for &quot;mall Holdings:-Memoranda by the President of the Boardof Agriculture and Fisheries (PapersG.T.-7594 and G.T.-7753:An Extinct from the J&amp;nutea of the HomeAffairs Committee (Paper H.A.C.-B5,Minute 5)*The Cabinet approved the following recommendationsof the Home Affairs Committee
(a) That County Councils be instructed to re-consider the rents at which they let their statutory Small Holdings established beforethe War, so as to bring them into closeragreement with the changed value of the land:(b) That the Councils should be instructed notto rack-rent their tenants, and especiallynot to take into account the improvementseffected by their tenants, or the change inthe rate of interest on loans:(e) That the Councils should take the positionof landowners working on a commercial basis and impose such increases as will make the rents of their Small Holdings comparable with the general level of rents of similarHoldings in the district.RISH RAILWAYS      (3) The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theOKPIRMATIOUP mmi&amp;MBM) Minister of Transport (Paper C.P.-79) covering a Bill13 ILL .designed to give statutory effect to the terms of para-graphs 10 and lg of the Agreement made between the Govem-ment and the Hallway Companies affected when the IrishRailways were taken over.The Cabinet approved the imiro-duction of the Bill.^EMPLOYMENT        (4) With reference to Cabinet 4 (19), Minute 1, theN3URAKGE.Cabinet had before them the following documents on thesubject of Unemployment InsuranceA Memorandum by the Minister of labour(Paper G.T.-81S5),A Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(Eape r 0. T ,-8155),A Memorandum by the President of the Boardof Agriculture and Fisheries (paper g.T.-8205),A Memorandum by the Minister of Health(Bape r G,T.).The Cabinet took note of the point urged by theChancellor of the Exchequer that, if it was decided toinclude Agriculture and Domestic Service in.a scheme ofUnemployment Insurance, it was essential not. to abandon
their Inclusion during the passage of the Bill through parliament.   If this were done, the finance of the whole scheme would he upset, since both these forme of insurancemight be expected to yield a profit.It was generally agreed that the inclusion of Doiaes-tlo Service would be unpopular, owing to the absence ofunemployment in domestlo service, and that, its passage-through Parliament would he a waiter of the greatest dif-flenity.It was stated that the agricultural interests wouldresent discrimination against that industry by leaving it out of the scheme.   Doubt was expressed, however, as towhether this point of view&apos;would be maintained when it was realised that, owing to the small amount of unemploymentin the agricultural industry, supposing this state ofaffairs continued, the discrimination would be in favour ofAgriculture, which would be tasking an excessive contributionto other forms of industry.   In this connection it was sug-gested that Agriculture might contrast but, as was contem-plated for some other large industries, such as the Railway8..The Cabinet- agreed -(a) To approve the principle of a scheme ofUnemployment InsuranceJ(o) That In the first instance both. Agricultureand Domestic Service should be left out ofthe Bills and the calculations as to theamounts of the contributions by the employ-ers, employed, and the State respectively,should be prepared on this basis.   If theclaims of Agriculture to be included shouldbe pressed strongly, this decision might bespe-eonside re d s(c) In order not to antagonise the Trades unions and Labour interests $ the Minister of labour should aim at a rate, of insurance amountingto SO/- for men and 15/- for women.   This,however, should be subject to the question being first examined by a Committee composed,of:-&apos;
)The Chan cell or of the !5x chequer,The Minister of labour,The Minister of Health,who should investigate the question more par-ticularly from the point of view of the possi-inviolability of a contribution by the employer of10d, a week-instead of ?d. a week, as&apos;now contemplated for the combined UnemploymentInsurance and Health Insurance.   If this wasconsidered feasible, the proportion of one-quarter to be paid by the state would, it was hoped, be slightly reduced;   a course whichwas considered justifiable In view of the greatfinancial burdens now laid. upon, the State.&quot;SUPPLY OP (5) The Cabinet had before them the following documentsSPIRITS.on the subject of the Supply of Spirits:-A Memorandum by the Pood Controller(Paper G.T.-8411),A Memo rand tarn by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(Paper CP.-98) .The original proposal of the Food Controller wasthat the quantity of spirits permitted to be released frombond should be increased on a scale proposed in his Memo-randuxo.   This proposal was based on the necessity of meet-ing the many undoubted cases of hardship existing at presentowing to the re-distribution of population and the return of demobilised men.Strong reasons, however, were urged In favour of removing all restrictions on the supply of spirits.   It waspointed out&apos;that, owing to the desire of holders to conservetheir stocks?   the rapid absorption of stocks by large com-binations;   the small production of spirits during the last few years;&apos; and the operation of the Immature Spirits Act,the amount of spirits available for the public would be only slightly in excess of the present amount if the restrictions were removed.   Further, the increased consumption would be/* counteracted by the lower strength at which spirits may be
supplied, restricted hours, and high prices.   Finally, itwas pointed out that the continuance of these restrictions-was -very unpopular, and the short supply of spirits wasattributed entirely to the Government, which Incurred greatodium and unpopularity by their maintenance.Against this it was pointed out that the opinion ofthe Churches and temperance advocates would be alienatedby the removal of restrictions the effect of which had beenWatched during the &quot;Jar with the greatest interest.   Further,in order to implement the promise that the benefits of liquor control during the War should not be thrown away withoutthorough examination, the Government had in course of pre-paration a measure for setting up a Commission to review thewhole guest ion cf llbuer restrictions.    It would, be prefer-able to postpone action until this Commission had reviewed the question.After some discussion, the Cabinet agreed -That the restrictions on the supply ofspirits should be removed.S, Whitehall Gardens, S.W:.l,Sovember 14, 1919.
