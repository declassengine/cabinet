(1) With reference to Cabinet 3 (19), Minute 5, theCabinet resumed their discussion on the.subject of Out-of-&quot;vforjs. Donation.    In addition to the Me.iaprandu.ra by the Ministerof labour (paper G.P.-S4), which had been under discussion at the previous Meetings, they had before them Memoranda by;the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Paper CP.-62), statingsix facts bearing on the subject under consideration, andoy the First Lord of the Admiralty (Paper 0,P.-69),During the discussion it was recalled that the Chan-eel lor of the Exchequer,  on October ft9th, in the course ofa review of the national prospects in regard to finance,had informed the House of Commons that the&apos; ordinary civilOut-of-vforit Donation would come to an. end on &quot;-oveober 24th,,nd     - a 3 fo3 lo 5 ii        t Ist-*if it is renewed, it will be - the act of theHouse, and the responsibility will rest withthe House&quot;.    (Harvard. Vol.i?,0. 0.415.)In view ef this announcement the Cabinet caise to the,onThat it would not be right to -continue the out-of-SFork Donation to civilians generally,unless exceptional conditions, such %s couldnot at present be foreseen, arose.In order to make provision for the Dockyard men, theTo approve in principle the Admiralty scheme(jnpi-s&apos;&apos;navy/ discharges, as descrihed in-the Minutes &quot;of t be&quot; last ^Meeting,&apos;sub ject toits feasibility being agreed to by a CommitteeThe Prime Minister,The Chancellor of the-Exchequer,The First Lord of the Admiralty,that  is to say, the Ministers principally concerned in the Deputation from the RoyalDockyard towns, which had waited on thePrime Minister on the previous day.The cost of this scheme is estimated by theAdmiralty at  450,000 for four months.
It was decided -

That the rate of the Out-of-Work Donation to former members of the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force should be -

20/- a week for men, and

15/- a week for women.



It was further decided that -



The Allowances for Children should be cancelled, although, of course, the cancellation of Children&apos;s Allowance would not apply to members of the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force on first receipt of Out-of-Work Donation.



Finally, it was decided -



That the announcement of these decisions should be accompanied by a statement that the Government were pressing on with their scheme of Unemployment of these decisions should be accompanied by a statement that the Government were pressing on with their scheme of the Unemployment Insurance.



Since the decisions on the various heads of the Unemployment Scheme are spread through the Minutes of three Meetings of the Cabinet, and the earlier decisions have in some cases been superseded by later ones, they are summarised below as a whole:-



(a) The policy of the Government is to introduce a system of Unemployment Insurance to which employers, employed, and the State shall contribute. They are strongly opposed to any system of Unemployment Insurance the whole cost of which is borne by the State, and are prepared to stand or fall by this. As a Out-of-Work Donation Scheme as the present exceptional conditions necessitate, must be framed in such manner as not to prejudice in any way the Government&apos;s Unemployment Insurance Scheme.

(b) The extensions of the Out-of-Work Donation summarised below must be announced as an emergency and temporary arrangement to meet the exceptional conditions produced by the War, and to bridge over the period required to bring the Unemployment Insurance Scheme into operation. Their announcement must be accompanied by a statement that the Unemployment Insurance Scheme is being pushed on as rapidly as possible.

(c) The issue of the Out-of-Work Donation to unemployed former members of the Royal Navy, Army, and Royal Air Force shall be continued after November 24th, at the rate of 20/- a week to men, and 15/- a week to women.



 


(d) The Allowance for Children shall be discontinued, but this, of course, will not apply to members of the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force receiving their Donation for the first time.

(e) The Out-of-Work Donation to civilians, other than ex sailors, soldiers and airmen, shall cease on November 24th, and shall not be renewed unless unforeseen circumstances of great urgency arise.

(f) In order to provide against extensive unemployment in the Royal Dockyard towns, where it is the Cabinet approved the following scheme proposed by the Admiralty:-



(i) To suspend all discharges for four months, at an estimated cost of Â£450,000.

(ii) To introduce throughout the Royal Dockyards, as a condition of this scheme, a system of dropping one or more days&apos; work every week.



(g) The scheme which had been suggested to the Admiralty for leasing portions of the Royal Dockyards to private firms for mercantile construction work was considered highly desirable.



THE AFFAIRS OF MALTA.



(2) The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dealing with the affairs of Malta, covering also a report by the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and a despatch from the Government (Paper G.T.-8317). In these documents certain changes and developments were recommended in the Constitution of the Island of Malta.

  


The Cabinet agreed -



That the Secretary of State for the Colonies should proceed along the lines recommended in his Memorandum, subject to the agreement of the Treasury so far as Imperial expenditure is concerned.



EMPLOYMENT DISABLED SERVICE IN THE POST OFFICE.



(3) The Cabinet had before them Memoranda by the Minster of Labour (Paper C.P.-43), and the Secretary of State for War (Paper C.P.-53), on the Employment of Disabled ex - Service men in the Post Office .



The issue placed before the Cabinet in these Memoranda was as to whether, in consequence of an agreement entered into the Post Office before the War (whereby 50 per cent, of certain classes of vacancies in the Post Office are reserved for ex professional sailors and soldiers), preference should be given to ex sailors and soldiers of the Regular Services over men who were not members of the professional Navy and Army but had become disabled in the present War. Sir Malcolm Ramsay&apos;s Committee on the question of the Employment of Disabled Men in Government Departments (whose Report is included with Paper G.T.-7869, approved by the War Cabinet on August 13, 1919 - War Cabinet 813, Minute 8) had recommended that posts expressly reserved for professional sailors, soldiers and airmen should not be allocated to disabled men when a qualified ex Regular sailor, soldier or seaman was available. This point of view was developed in the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War (Paper C.P.-53), in which it was pointed out that the promise of the posts had been held out by the War Office as one of the strongest inducements for enlistment in the Army before the War.

The general feeling of the Cabinet was that it would not be right to take any course that ruled out disabled men, or which gave preference to able-bodied men over disabled 




 men. It was generally agreed, however, that among disabled men ex-Regulars should have precedence.

Having regard to the fact, elicited during the discussion, that some 3,000 disabled ex-Regular Service men are awaiting absorption -



The Cabinet felt that the difficult question of principle raised in the Memoranda did not call for decision at the present time.

(4) Attention was called to the following Parliamentary Question to be asked by Colonel Yate on November 13th:-



"To ask the Postmaster-General whether the old agreement, by which 50 per cent, of the vacancies in the Post Office were to be reserved for the old sailors and soldiers who have finished their period of service, is about to be annulled; whether the arrangement was made one of the attractions in the past for recruiting; and, if so, whether, in view of the pledge given by the Admiralty and War Office to those whom they asked to enlist, he will say what action he proposes to take in the matter".

The Cabinet agreed -

That the Postmaster-General&apos;s answer to this question should be in the sense that there is no intention of altering the former arrangement, and that many thousands of disabled men are awaiting employment in the Post Office.



THE "SAVE THE CHILDREN FUND"



(5) The attention of the Cabinet was called to the following Parliamentary Question, put down on the Paper of the House of Commons for Monday by Mr Horatio Bottomley to the Prime Minister:-



"Mr Bottomley to ask the Prime Minister whether it is the fact, as stated in certain posters issued by the 

"Save the Children Fund", that the Government has agreed to give Â£1 for every Â£1 raised by voluntary contributions for the purpose of feeding children in Armenia, Czecho-Slovakia, Poland, Austria, South Russia and Hungary, and, if so, under which Vote the Government contribution will fall".

It was explained that a proportion of the moneys allotted by the British Government to the relief measures, undertaken and administered by the Supreme Economic Council, 

 


had, at. the request of Lord Robert Cecil, who was at thattime the British Representative on the Supreise Economic Coun-cil and is President of the *S&amp;ve the Children Fund&quot;, been allowed to be used for the purpose of raising; voluntary contributions in the manner explained in the Question.    Itwas - understood that similar action was being taken inFrance.The Secretary was instructed to send theQuestion to the Treasury for the wspara-f$a ^ *0 /*    -mtb sj      .X
