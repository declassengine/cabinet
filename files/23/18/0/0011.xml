Jliniets? s*ave a gura^ary of a con veesationwhieh he and the Lord Privy Seal had had with the flight Horn&apos;&apos;a Lordtfasaee 0*Connor, kk&amp; kkkkS/Justice of Ireland.   The latter.had aeked the irrlsse minister to see hita.   He had reportedthat he would prefer Count?:&quot; Option for Ulster,&apos; with power for the Counties to vote cut e.f Rome Rule, which would result-in th** six Counties rkraaininp attached to the United Kingdom^He believed that, in the long run, thie scheme would -be the -one beet adapted to unite the six Counties to the rest,ofIreland,  since they scull be attracted to it by the fact that,taxation would alraeet certainly he -less in the portion cfIreland tinder Home Rule.    If, however, thie was not feasible,:&quot;,Er 0&apos;Connor- would prefer that the P&amp;rli^ent for the lferth*-g&amp;at of Ireland should be for the sirt Counties *a.th**r thgj^-^-1-
Illfor ulster as a whole.   Be Jmd admitted that &quot;the Irish people,lived in an atmosphere of delusions * fend that Ireland was aland of delusions* where the population, who never read any-thin?; but their own newspapers* did. not in the least under-stand the Pacts of the situation.   They believed that theBrltinh people had only one desire,, m&amp;j&amp;ely, to r*ob the irish people of their patrimony.   The heat Irish citizens eondersnedthe refine of n*order, but there was no moral courage inIreland tc prompt the peeple to denounce the mrderers.Mr 0* Connor admitted that. what ever course the BritishCevernreent took would be condemned by the Irish people, buthe thought they ^would  be willing to worS: a eehssse providingfor a separate Par lira, icent for the sl&amp; Counties, and no otherscheme.   He had stated that he vae moro of a Catholic than an Iriohv&amp;an, arid tad undertaken to ascertain the views ofthe Irish hierarchy on those cue at ionft.^he general discussion which Pol lowed        &quot;eased onthe hypothesis that the policy of the Union on old lineswas no longer sufficient, and that sojao development in thedirection of self-government sr&amp;a necessary.   The discussioncentred is&amp;inly round the three following proposals?-(1) That there should be a Parliament for the -South and Wes&quot;t of Ireland, but that- the six&apos; Counties should be allowed to vote infavour of resslnlng part of the United--h-       ;  for all purposes:(ii) That there should be. a Parliament for the gSouth and fife at of Ireland, and a parliament for the whole of Ulster; h(Hi) That there should be a Parliament for theOif     % .TX^    v3 5. Xby the Allied and Associated Powers, and supported by the- British Government, at tho Peace Conference in Paris..   If the.
six Counties desired to remain part of the United Kingdom, why, it was asked, should they not be permitted to decide by plebiscite in favour of it? It was pointed out, however, that the Ulster Covenanters had bound themselves to treat Ulster as a unit. They would therefore be bound to create the strongest possible opposition to the adoption of this plan. This proposal would be equally unacceptable to the Irish Nationalists and all those moderate elements in the South and West on whom the Government would have to depend ultimately for support. Consequently, the prospects of the eventual unity of Ireland would be greatly diminished by the exclusion of the six Counties. Finally, the administrative difficulties of this plan, involving separate government in respect of agriculture, roads, and other matters where the interests of the six Counties were closely bound up with those of the neighbouring Counties, were very great.

  On these grounds the Cabinet agreed -

	

	To rule out the proposal that the sux

	Counties should be permitted to vote

	in favour of remaining part of the

	United Kingdom for all purposes.



The Ultimate Aim of the Government&apos;s Policy.



(4) The Foregoing discussion gave rise to an interchange of views as to the ultimate aim of the Government&apos;s policy.

    While some views were expressed in favour of keeping Ulster, or at any rate the six Counties, permanently separate from the remainder of Ireland, the general feeling was that the ultimate aim of the Government&apos;s policy in Ireland was a united Ireland with a separate Parliament of its own, bound by the closest ties to Great Britain, but that this must be achieved with the largest possible support, and without offending the Protestant&apos;s in Ulster: in fact, as Sir Edward Carson had put it, Ulster must be won by kindness: and this ultimate aim could only be achieved by something like general consent in Ireland.

 	  


Composition of The Northern Parliament: Ulster or the Six Counties?



(5) The reasons both for and against a separate Parliament for the six Counties rather than for the whole of Ulster were, in the main, similar to those for and against the exclusion of the six Counties.  An additional reason urged in favour of limiting the Parliament to the six Counties was that the rate of increase of population among the Roman Catholics was greater than among the Protestants, with the result that in course of time there would be a danger, if Ulster was adopted as a Parliamentary unit, that the Protestants would be swamped by a Roman Catholic majority.  From an examination of the statistics, however, it transpired that in fact, whether from the immigration of Protestants or other causes, the percentage of Roman Catholics in Ulster had been decreasing for several decades, and was now only 43 per cent, of the total population.  A second reason in support of this proposal was the desirability of making people under the administration of the Northern Parliament as homogeneous as possible.   In view more particularly of the difficulty which the Covenanters would encounter in accepting the scheme if it were confined to the six Counties, and of the superiority of Ulster as an administrative unit, the Cabinet provisionally agreed -

 That the Bill should, be worked out for a

 Parliament for Ulster as well as for the three

 Southern Provinces.

It was further agreed, however -

That if, after the introduction of the

measure in Parliament, it was found that

the limitation of the Parliamentary area

to the six Counties was more acceptable,

the question might be re-considered. It

was recognised, however, that the adminstrative

problem would then require very careful examination.                                              

The Irish Units in the British Army.





6) The Question was raised as to whether, in the event of the adoption of the proposals before the Cabinet, the War Office could continue to raise the units hitherto recruited


in Ireland.It was generally art reedThat, since all questions relating to defence were reserved^ the War Officeootild continue to r soruit these units.(?) The suggestion was made that, in view of the very limited powers reserved to the proposed Council of Ireland,and taking into consideration the fact that this? Councilwcftii^ son Wist of nembers of the Houses of Commons of southern and Northern Ireland, it would not be advisable tc extend its functions fry placing the Police under the Council&apos;control.It was explained, however, that the Cabinet Committeehad exaiuined this question and had eome to the conclusionthat whenever the Police were transferred to Irish controlthey should be placed in the Department of the Minister atthe head of the Executive responsible for law and order:that is to say, the Minister corresponding to tho :?omeSecretary.(8) In connect ion with the discussion on Folios, attention was drawn to the danger which would arise If some limitationwere not placed on the numbers of Folios which could be raised.It was pointed out that the experience of the recent *7arshowed that the bases on the detsst of Ireland sere essentialto the protection of our trade, and that their occupation or use by an enenn? lower saight be disastrous.    If the numbersof Police were not limited, they rai^ht he used instead oftroop&apos;? to seise these bases in collusion with the naval operations of an enstay.   Attention was drawn in this son-neotion to the large number of armed men which had recentlybeen raised by Germany ostensibly as Police Forces.  . , i  ,tfhe Cabinet hp reed - That the Chief Seoretary for Ireland should draw the attention of the draughtsman of thg.
in Ireland.

It was generally agreed -

That, since all questions relating to defence were reserved, the War office could continue to recruit these units.                                                                            

Police.



(7) The suggestion was made that, in view of the very limited powers reserved to the proposed Council of Ireland, and taking into consideration the fact that this Council would consist of members of the Houses of Commons of Southern and Northern Ireland, it would not be advisable to extend its functions by placing the Police under the Council&apos;s control.

    It was explained, however, that the Cabinet Committee had examined this question and had come to the conclusion that whenever the Police were transferred to Irish control they should he placed in the Department of the Minister at the head of the Executive responsible for law and order: that is to say, the Minister corresponding to the Home Secretary.

(8) In connection with the discussion on Police, attention was drawn to the danger which would arise if some limitation were not placed on the numbers of Police which could be raised. It was pointed out that the experience of the recent War showed that the bases on the coast of Ireland were essential to the protection of our trade, and that their occupation or use by an enemy Power might be disastrous. If the numbers of Police were not limited, they might be used instead of troops to seize these bases in collusion with the naval operations of an enemy.  Attention was drawn in this connection to the large number of a armed men which had recently been raised by Germany ostensibly as Police Forces. The cabinet agreed -

  That the Chief Secretary for Ireland should draw the attention of the draughtsman of the


		Bill to Article 162 of the Treaty or Peace

		with Germany, which is as follows:-

		

		" The number of employees or officials

		 of the German States, such as Customs

		officers, Forest Guards and Coast Guards,

		shall not exceed that of the employees or

		officials functioning in these capacities

		in 1913.



			The number of gendarmes and employees

			or officials of the local or municipal

			police may only be increased to an extent

			corresponding to the increase of population

			since 1913 in the districts or municipalities

			in which they are employed.                                                                                                                                                                   These employees and officials may not be assembled

                        for military training". 

The Postal Service.



(9) The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the proposal that the Post Office, both internal and external, should be retained in the hands of the Imperial Government, but should be transferable (except radio-telegraphy and cables) to the control of an Irish Parliament if and when such a body was constituted.

 The Postmaster-General stated that he had not had an opportunity of examining these proposals. At first sight he believed them to be acceptable, but he reserved his final opinion.



Finance of the Bill.



(10)  Sir Laming Worthington-Evans gave the Cabinet a summary of the latest proposals of the Cabinet Committee in regard to finance.

       The Chancellor of the Exchequer reserved any expression of opinion on these proposals, as they differed entirely from those which had previously been presented to him.

(11) Objections were made to the proposal to give any sort of financial bonus to the South and West of Ireland, which had deserted Great Britain in its hour of need and had done their utmost to hamper the British Empire in the   





	   			


prosecution of the War.   It was suggested that the desire of liberty could not be strong if it was necessary to bribeIreland to accept it *It was pointed out, however, that under the financial proposals of the Goio&amp;ltt&amp;e the Irish Governments would nothave the power to levy Income Tax or to impose anything exceptlocal taxation.   The bonus had been proposed as oDispensationfor this, In order to provide eosee elasticity in the financialre s on roe s o St he Qo ve rn^ssnt s sons s rned .Without finally deciding the question, which was bound up with the general financial scheme* the Cabinet agreedprovisionally -- hat the Bill should&apos;be drawn on the baststhat a bonus would be $ranted,(1ft) It was suggested that, before the questions oftaxation generally and of InOose Thvx in particular weredoaided, enquiry should bo made as to tho position Qf theika&amp;rioan and Canadian States in this respect,.  -Diplomaticallyit $rag cf great importance to bo able to say that ireland was in this respect in a position not less favourable thanthat of the American and Canadian Stated.The Cabinet Invited  Sir lading *irorthington-F,vans to enquire into and report upon this question.(IS) Attention was called to the proposal that the local   .Irish services should cotae into operation under Irish controlfron the date prescribed for the Act to cosse into force.It was pointed out that, from a financial point of view, itwas of the greatest importance that the cost of the local services should not be Increased by any additions such as,for example, Housing and. Education schemes.
of uxuirb  iet.ion of      (14) The Cabinet, agreed -the Governmentjtf Ireland That the Chief Secretary for Ireland, inSill. ocnsxiltation, if he desired, with one or.more of his colleagues, and with suchIrish officials as &quot;he might desire, shouldcomplete the draft of the Bill on theOasis of the above provisional deoisions,as soon as possible, with a view to itsfurther consideration bv the Cabinet.lOUSIftG. (15) With reference to Cabinet 8 (19), Conclusion 6, itwas agreed - -That the Cabinet Committee on Housingshould have Cabinet authority to approve the Housing Bill, which, it was explained,ought to be circulated in parliament before the end of the week.SUBSIDY fC (16) The attention of the Cabinet was called to a Memorsn-plELIC UTILITYpGKfAKIRS.       duis by the aiiniet-er of Health, on the subject of a subsidy to Public Utility Companies (Paper CP.-SSS).It was pointed out that this Memorandum, althoughinvolving expenditure, had been circulated to the Cabinetwithout orevlou* eommimioaiion with the treasury.   The WarCabinet had decided that no Estimates were to be presented to Parliament without previous submission to and approval bythe Treasury (War Cabinet 553, Minute S), and in the spiritof this decision it was very important that proposals ofthis Kind &quot;should not be circulated without previous consult--at ion with the Treasury.(if) The Cabinet took, note of the Conclusions of thefollowing Confers nee a of iviinisters:-Conference of Ministers held onwoveiaber 13, 1919 (Appendix II): -Conference of Ministers held onNovember SO, 1919 (Appendix. Ill)tConference of Ministers held onNovember &amp;lf 19-19 (Appendix IV).ui    hiteha 11 Gardens, S,W.l,December 3, 1919.
HEADS Of PROPOSAL.1.      That two Parliaments should be sot up in Ireland,one for the provinces of Ulster, and one for the threeSouthern provinces, upon which should be immediatelyconferred all the powers of government except: -(a)       Those permanently reserved to tho imperial parliament, such as Crown, Foreign Affairs, Defence,Dignitaries, Treason, Trade outside Ireland,Wireless etc.fb)       Powers reserved to the Imperial Parliament until an all Ireland. Parliament has been established,2,      That the Finance of the Irish Parliaments should be derived from:-(a) local Taxation, 1919,  2,700,000,(b) A transferred sum equal to the difference betweenthe product of local taxation and the cost of local services at the date of the passage of the Act,1919,   8,437,000,(o )       A sum equal to the annuities payable under theLand Purchase Act.      1919,   ,990,000 rising to 5,500,000,This will start the Irish legislature with the whole presentcost of the administration and a free gift of about  3,000t00Cin addition,.      It will leave Ireland paying its present oon-tribution to Imperial Services less the free gift of  3,000,000as abovec      It iS further proposed that if the yield of the taxes retained in Imperial hands increases, there should bea triennial examination of the object on which this additional revenue is spent, and If it is spent on Great Britain as opposed to Imperial purposes there should be a proportionate increase of the fixed transferred sum.3*      That a Counoil for Ireland should be constitutedconsisting of 20 representatives from each of the twoParliaments with powers of private Bill legislation fromthe outset, and exercising such further powers as may heconferred upon it by simultaneous acts passed by the twoIrish Parliaments.4.     That the two Irish legislatures, should be given largeconstituent powers so that by simultaneous legislationthey can confer up&amp;n the Council of Ireland any cowers notreserved to the Imperial Parliament and can, if they so wish,oonvert it without reference to the Imperial Parliament intoa Parliament for the whole of Ireland,       Inasmuch as the&apos;appointed day will probably not be earlier than fifteen months from the. passage of the Act, this will give the twoParliaments ample time in which to consider the disadvantages of a oomplote division of all Irish services and to make arrangements with the Council of Ireland for the operation as common servioes before the division comes into automatic &quot;&apos;operation. :   .5,.     That the following powers should bo retained in tho handsof the Imperial Government, but should be transferable onblocto the oontrol of the Irish Parliament as soon a s such.a bodyis constituted to take the place of the Council of Ireland 5-
(a) Trustee Savings Bank, and Post Office, &quot;bothinternal and external, but not including wirolassand cable s.(b) The appointment of the higher judicial offides,the numbers and salaries being fixed by the IrishParliaments, according to Canadian precedent.(c) Income Tax.6.      Shat the  control of Irish police and residentmagistrates should be handed over to Irish control at themd of three years or on the constitution of an IrishParliament, subject to guarantees being afforded that all existing magistrates and constabulary will be allowed to retire with full pensions rights, and adequate financialcompensation  if they elect not to serve a hew IrishGore rnmenta7c      That after the establishment of Irish unity,Irelandrs contribution to Imperial Services, i,,e Debt,War Pensions, and Pef.SJs.oe should be based upon her capacity to pay , as ce r tai no d th e n and revised the re af to r e ve ry fx veyears,  customs and excise being retained as security forth is c on t r I bu t i on.8,      That representation in tho Imperial Pserldxsm&amp;a%should be in proportion to population which should giveIreland about 63 or 64 members,&apos;9,      That an In and Out clause should, be insertedon the principle that Irish members should not be allowedto vote  on any Bill whose application to Ireland is expressly excluded, or whose application is expresslylimited to Great Britain,10c      That the total number of Irish elected members should be  three times that of the representation of ireland in the Imperial Purllament.       This will give a total ofabout 190 members of whom about 125 will constitute the parliament of South Ireland end about 65 the Parliament of north Ireland,        It has the additional  idvantage that thesame constituencies will serve for the Imperial and theIrish elections,  the difference being that in the case ofthe Irish elections, each constituency will return three members of proportional representation, Instead of the onethey will return to the Imperial Parliament.11.      The Sub-Committee recommend that the lord lieutenant should not himself preside over the Council ofIreland, but that he should have power to nominate thePresident at his own discretion.if

PROPOSEDPEF11AB BUTOPGAKISA-PI 01 10DEAL WITHHATIOPALSTRIKES.lihllAPireformsBiIX*Par 11 am en-tar y rimefor(1)    with referenoe to the second Conclusion of a Confor-ence held at 10.Downing Street,  zn tho previous day,  onthe subject of a proposed permanent organisation to dealwith national emergencies,   the Chancellor of the Raahoquer,who had been unable to be present when this question was discussed,  explained that he had been informed that certainstores which were essential to the scheme were now being sold to the general public.    The question was now being con-sidered by his Department in regard to its financial aspectbut in the meantime he suggested that the Disposal board might be instructed temporarily to suspend action in respectof those articles which might be essential to the scheme.,The Conference concurred in the view taken by the Chancellor cf the exchequer-quer, and instructed the Secretary  (x)    Io ask the Minister of Munitions to postpone ftr a month the disposal &quot;jfsuch stores as were involved in thyscheme of tho Supply and TransportCommit tee,.(ii)    To request the Ministry of transport to ccvmmxpjdcate a list  ;f the storesconcerned to the Ministry if Munitionsfor the information of the DisposalBoard,(2) Having regard to the great importancea both fromthe point of view of our future relations with India andfor political reasons generally,  of pressing on thisquestion,  it was agreed that Thursday and Friday of next week, November 27 and f-h   1919,  should be.devoted to theDiscussion of the Indian Reforms Bill in the Heuse of Commons,It was felt that,  In view of the large amountof -time occupied with the Indian Rofrrms Bill in Committeeupstairs, and -the harmonicus.arrangements that had been arrived at,  it- shimold be sufficient if two days only cfParliamentary time were reserved for it in the House ofCommons.PREMIUM BOEDS-1-
PREMIUMBOW PS,i&amp;] With reference to Cabinet 1 (19), Minute 6, when itwas decided that if the House of Commons desired the adop-tion of a,system of Premium Bonds the Government should not-oppose it,., attention was drawn to the growing strength ofthe movement against Premium - Bonds.    The Memorandum ofthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, covering a letter from theGovernor of the Bank cf England (paper cp.-95) and etherIndications were ciied as evidence that opposition toPremium Bonds was growing &quot;both inside and o^^tside theGovernment,    It was consequently felt that, when receivingtho Deputation of the National Free GhUreh Council en thosnibjectg, the Prime Minister should be accompanied by ministers who were in favour z , as well as those who were opposed,to, the issue of these Bonds.This led to a general discussion ..b  the question of: Premium Bonds, In -the course- of which the following reasonswere urged against the proposal:-(a)   That it was a highly disputabTequestionwhether they would-.raise-:any large amountof money:.(B)    That Sir.Robert bindersley, who had been mainly responsible for the success of thenational Par Bonds, strongly condemned the project:(o)    That it was.repugnant to the moral sense of the public, aa indicated by-protestswhlsh load been received from represents-ti-ves of every religious body.It was recognised that the Government would beplaced in an embarrassing/position if the Chancellor of-the Exchequer, who would be bound to speak and would pro-bably have to open the discussion on the subject, made a speech against Premium Ponds and the House subsequentlydecided in favour of thorn, in which case the chancellor would nevertheless have to introduce tho necessary legisla-tion,    It was generally agreed, however, that-, In spite ofthis objection, if the scheme was found on examination tobe detrimental to the national interests, it would bedesirable for the Chancellor to give the House the reasonsagainst its adoption,.The

lUPPL^SS. (5)    &quot;lth reference t0 War Cabinet 5-5-2, Minute--iVtheMinister of Transport raised a point of urgency inconnection with tho Elwctrioity Supply Bill.    He statedthat tho Bill had received somewhat drastic handling in committee upstairs in the House of Commons:    in particular,Clause 44 :had boon cut out of the original draft, whichproposed to transfer tho general control of electrical power from tho Board of Trado to the Ministry of Transport.The effect of this would be two fold(a) It would render impracticable a schome,which had been devxsed after the most careful consideration,  of unifying andco-ordinating electrical power throughoutthe country on an identical gauge andunder a single control, with a view both to economy and also to the rapid and widespread development of many of ourindust ries , including..agriculture:and(b) It would place electrical power under theBoard of Trade, which had no technical staff accustomed to direct practical aor-vices, and which was surcharged withwork of its own.If the committee views were accepted by the House.three grave mistakes would, in his opinion, bo made:-(i)    Tho powers would be taken arrom the Minis tryof Transport:(ii)    They would be placed under the Board ofTrado, which was undesirable for the abovereasons:(iii)    Electrical supply would be divided up into two parts and oe under two directing agencies,involving the separation of the industrialfrom i no t r ana po r fc us e r *The President of the Board of Trade said that he agreed generally with the above view:    his Department was anxious to see railways included in the general scheme oftrade development by more extensive use of electrical power.    His advisers were not, however, unanimous as tothe Department which should be responsible for thedireo-tdon of electrical supply,  but failing the settingup of a General Fuel Department, which was advocatedin certain quarters, he agreed that the control shouldbe under the Ministry&quot; of Transport.
The Home Secretary, who was In charge of the Bill,explained that the opposition in Committee upstairs was dueto the fact that the Committee was largely composed ofrepresentatives of municipal, power-house, and other inter-ests, who met on the common ground of jealously of andantagonism to Government intervention In electrical manage-ment.The Conference agreed(a) That the control of electrical supply anddistribution under one Department was essen-tial to the proper development of industryand transport in this countryj(b) That this control should be vested In theMinistry of Transport as the most appropriate department.!(c) That if the House would, not accept the ministerial view, it would be advisablenot to proceed with the Bills(d) That the more reasonable critics of the bill might be reconciled to its adoption if theywere told that, unless the Government viewprevailed, the Bill would be dropped:(e) That the procedure followed in the case ofthe Aliens Restriction Bill, when Ministersmet the principal critics in the House, mightbe adopted with advantage in the present instance:(f) That it. was desirable that the Prime Minister,if possible, accompanied by Mr * Bonar Law, Mr.Shortt and Sir Eric Gednes,  should meet thesaid critics with a view to reinforcing the powerful arguments urged by the Ministry ofTransport..Tne Home Secretary and the Whips undertook to arrange that Mr, Neville Chamberlain andMr, A heel with others if necessary should meet the Prime Minister,.the Lord privy seal, the Home Secretary and the Minister ofTransport,  in the Leader of the House&apos;room that afternoon at 4 p.m.;and also to lay upon the Table of the House the following morning a new Clause re-embodying the pro-posals contained in Clause 44 of the originaldr a ft &amp;

the re-conversion of the factories within a specified time to the manufacture of munitions in the event of anational emergency.Some discussion ensued as to the rate of disposalof munitions factories.,&apos; and it was suggested that   theGretna Green factory should now be used for the manufactureof cordite for the Wavy as well as for the Army,    During thenotWar this had/been practicable., as the cordite used bythe Army was not suitable for Naval use, but It was consld-ered likely that new specifications for Naval corditecould be agreed between the Admiralty and the War Office,and that the manufacture of cordite for both Services couldbe carried out at one factory.The Conference decided:-(i) To approve the proposals set forth inthe Memorandum by the Minister ofMunitions (Paper C .

NDATES. -     The Confereenafcs had under, consideration a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for the Colonies,   (Appendix)regarding the issue of mandates under the League of nations for territories captured&quot; and occupied by the Allied Powers,and suggesting-that In every case -here  (1) A particularex-German Colony has been assigned to   X as mandatary by a unanimous resolution of the Supreme Council and  (2) Xis prepared to   eccept the mandate under the conditions unanimous-imously agreed to by the Council, the Powers should now beasked to Issue mandates to   X., &apos;wi without&apos;delay and without waiting for the deposit of ratifications.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES explained thatalmost every day he was receiving telegrams from the Domln-ions clamouring for the issue of mandates,, and raising veryavkward questions.    He had not so far circulated Papers onthe subject, but he desired that the Cabinet should becognisant of the nature of possible trouble In this connection.Months had passed since decisions were taken in Paris as tomandatory powers,   and the terms of the mandates were considered at length and agx*eed. upon; yet the actual mandates were notforthcomings    It was ver:r difficult to explain the situation to the Dominions especially Australia, whose representations&apos;-ere of a most&apos; pressing character^   &quot;&quot;Und^r the Treaty of PeaceGermany ceded her colonies to the Five Principal Powers,whose representatives in Paris had agreed to whom these territories were to be assigned but the mandates could notbe Issued until peace had been ratified..    In   his view It was urgently necessary that thmatsdelite action should be taken beforethe Paris Conference broke up.    The decision of the Council InParis did not by itself transfer the territories In question to whomto-the parties,/the   mandates were to be assigned
On the ratification of the Treaty, these territoriesrould all pass to the Five Powers.    A practical way ofdealing with the situation would he that the Five powers should formstiy transfer them to the several mandatories.The actual machinery would consist In a series of Contentionsbetween the Five Powers on the one part and the particularmandatory on the other. Forms of such Conventions had actually been drawn up.    The real point was, should the BritishEmpire take its own line, based upon the decisions takensome months before In Paris, or should It await suchdefinite authority from the Allied Powers?Some discussion followed in which It was suggested thatthe best thing to do might be tc assume that the decisions which had been taken by the Plenipotentiaries, and had beenpromulgated, was validj if this validity was to be calledinto question, it would be for the League of Nations to do so.It was pointed out that without a formal assignment of the mandated territories legal difficulties might arise for in-stance, in the ease of German East Africa.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS read out anote which had been prepared by Mr. Hurst of the ForeignOf-&quot;ice, which enquired whether he should proceed with thepreparation of drafts of Conventions with the various PowCrsconcerned,  -hereby the said Powers would formally recognise the mandate of the British Empire for certain territories.Lord Curzon said he had been deputed by his colleagues toattend the first meeting of the League of Nations, which wasto be held in a fortnight&apos;s time, and   asked whether theCabinet desired that he should prepare the drafts and submitthem to the Allied  snd Associated representatives at themeeting.
The Conference agreed:

 That the Foreign Secretary should

(a) Prepare draft Conventions, but that these should not be submitted at present to the Allied Powers, as such action might be construed as indicating that we did not consider that we were entitled to take over the control of the territories mandated to us, unless and until the Conventions had been signed:

(b) In the meantime sound the American Government through our Ambassador in Washington, and find out whether the United States were likely to sign the peace:

(c) Obtain the opinion of his departmental exports in International law as to whether, in the event of only three of the Allied Powers ratifying the Peace Treaties the assignment by these three Powers to various mandatories would be valid:

(d) In the event of America signing, take the opportunity of the first meeting of the League of Nations, subject to the Cabinet approving this course, to get the Conventions signed.



CONCESESSION OF AFRICAN TERRITORY TO ITALY.



In the course of the above, discussion attention was drawn to a telegram from Sir Eyre Crowe, dated 17th November, 1919, stating that, regarding the contemplated cessions to Italy on the Western frontier of Egypt and in Jubaland, it had always been understood by the British Delegates in Paris that no definite cessions would be made except as part of the general arrangement, which would include the question of Asia Minor and the Adriatic, and expressing the hope that there would be no departure from this understanding, as otherwise Great Britain would be deprived of her most powerful and valuable lever in future bargaining with Italy.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that if we made certain concessions to Italy now, we could almost certainly obtain Italian recognition, of our position in Egypt which, as the High Commissioner had recently urged, would be very valuable to us at the present moment.

Other


ether considerations, however, wight outweigh this; and itwas certainly the fact that we wanted something to bargainwith&apos;-in&apos;the case , for Instance? &apos; of   Adalia.    On the ediolehe&apos; *ras disposed to think that we should press for a general settlement later oni    The Italians were continually extending the venuea    In the case of the Adriatic, fyr example, theywere now opening their mouths much wider.    It was not nowmerely a question of Flume and a small strip of the coast,they wanted the  whole of Yxigo-Slav Istria behind it.    he himself thought the only solution of this question was for theItalians themselves t&amp; cone to come agreement with Yuge- &apos;postponingSlavs*-Xaere were several good reasons for/a settlementnownItaly wanted to re-open the question of the Egyptianfrontls^ she wanted a further extension of territory in east Africa, and she wanted more in Abyssiniae    He was to seethe Italian Ambassador that evening,, and the interview wouldgive him the opportunity of taking whatever line hiscolleagues might decide upon.THE SECRETARY OF ST...TE FOR THE COLONIES reminded theConference that a special clause of the Treaty of london of 1915 laid doFon that In the event of Franc e and Englandobtaining substantial conquests In Africa, Italy would beentitled to equitable consideration,- and in Paris certainprovisional agreements had been reached as to &quot;hat was equivalent.    None of our arrangements In Paris f however j,in his view, hau any international validity until they wereformally embodied in some legal instrument.The Conference agreed;That cessions to Italy, all of which arose outof a single instrument, namely, the Treaty ofLondon should farm part of a general arrangement with that country, which would Include Africa^, &apos; &apos;the Adriatic and Asia Minor,and
and requested the Foreign Secretary to inform theItalian AmhaasLador an.d_.JSlr Eyre-Crowein the above sonae.2, Whitehall Gardens,S * \7a  I 1st November. .1919,
Memorandum by tho Secretary of State for the Colonies.My life is rendered a burden to me by telegrams from theDominions (generally addressed to the Prime Minister butreferred to me to suggest a reply) clamouring for the issueof &quot;Mandates1&apos; for the Pacific Islands.  German South WestAfrica, etc-.., etcI fully realise tho awkward position in which Australia,New Zealand and South Africa aro all placed through having no formal authority to legislate for or otherwise deal withthe territories assigned to them b;/ resolutions of the&quot;Supremo Council&quot; in Paris *     For my own part I am in quitethe same kind of difficulty over East Africa,    Almost everyday some problem arises which requires for its solution,that we should know whether we have or have not the authorityof a Mandatory Power over that country.All the spade-work necessary for the issue of Mandateshas been laboriously done.      The conditions to be imposed onMandatories of the B and 0 classes have been approved by the&quot;Supreme Council&quot;,   and,  except in the case of Togo andCameroons, with respect to which there is a hitch - Francebeing unwilling to accept her share of these Colonies underthe normal &quot;B&quot; Mandate - there Is no substantial reason whyMandates for all the territoriese whose destiny has beendecided by the &quot;Supreme Council&quot;, should not issue any day.But there is a difficulty of form.    The Treaty withGermany vests the Colonies given up by her in the principal allied and Associated Powers.      It may be urged that, untilthe Treaty is brought into force by the deposit of the necess-ary number of ratifications, this vesting is not complete andtherefore these Powers have as yet no right to dispose of theColonies.     But this argument opens up a long vista offurther uncertainty.    The coming into force of the Treaty isbeing delayed from week to week and from month to month.    Theaction of America may lead to a great deal more dolay.    Hewould be a bold man, who ventured to assert that the treaty will come into force this year or that the settlement, whichit is Intended to effect, will not have begun to crumbleaway before the coping stone has been put upon the edifice.And again, even if tho Treaty does come into force thisyear, but America stands aside,  it may be argued that, whileAmerica cannot concur in the issue of Mandates under theTreaty because she is not a party to it,  the four other powers cannot dispose of the ceded Colonies without Americanconcurrence.I can see no way out of all this tangle, in which wehave now been living for months, except to get away fromtechnicalities and take immediate action based on the substant-ial merits of the case.      I therefore suggest that in everyease where (l) a particular ox-German Colony has been assig-ned to Z as mandatory by a unanimous resolution of the&quot;Supremei P P I I H I,
1135&quot;Supreme Council&quot; and  (2) 2 is prepared to accept the Mandateunder the conditions unanimously agreed to by tho Council,  thoPowers should now bo asked to issue a Mandate to X with-out delay and without waiting for tho deposit ofratifications.      Germany has by ratifying the Treaty given up all claim to thoso Colonies,      Tho Principal Allied powers have already pledged themselves to deal with them in aparticular way,      Way not giro effect to that pledge atonce,  instead of leaving the Administration of these territories, whose ultimate destination Is certain,  in a prolonged welter of indofinitoness and of temporary and provisional arrangements ?The  invitation to  do this should be addressed to  theGreat Powers represented at Paris before the present conference breaks up,      Even if America,  in view of theuncertaint;/ of her adhesion to tho Peace Treaty,   did notcare to join in tho issue of Mandates at the present time,I see no reason why the other Principal Allied and associated powers should not execute the necessary documents, leaving it to America to become a party to them if or whan shewas so minded.(Initialled) M.19th November,  1919.

! 137pF- PRICE in accordance with a. decision of the Cabinet,   reachedp COAL.at a Meeting on the previous day. (Cabinet 8 (IS),   Con-elusion 7),   the Conference met to consider the question ofthe price of Coal.The president of the Board of Trade gave a brief reviewof the events which led    up to the 6/- increase in theprice of coal,  and reminded the Conference that during the debate on the subject in the House of Commons the Govern-ment undertook to reduce the price cf coal if the outputexceeded the estimated figure of 217,000,000 tons for 1919.The present position was that the output for the whole period since the 6/- increase had been under the rate of217 ,,000,000 tons,   sc that if the Government regarded merely the letter of their undertaking they wore n^t bound in anyway to reduce the price of coal.    It was his opinion,  bow-ever,  that if the undertaking were interpreted in the spirit and not in the letter,   some reduction would have to be made.The reason was that larger quantities of coal had been ex-ported at far greater prices than had ever been expected.These coal  exports had provided a big profit,   taking theindustry as a whole,  although the ooal used for householdpurposes and industry in this country was being sold on anaverage at less than cost price.    In effect,   industrial and household coal was being subsidised out of the large profits made by expert coal.The objection to an all-round reduction in the priceof coal was that the inland collieries who were not ex-porting would cease to pay their way,   and would claim. financial support from the Government.    He was of opinionthat industry as a whole,  with the possible exception ofthe iron and steel industries,   could very well afford to pay/- a ton more for coal than they were doing at present.The profits being made by industries were enormous,  and hethought it was unsound to increase those profits out of temporary profits of certain coal-mines when the recult
would be that many inland coal-mines would cease to pay. He desired to suggest that the profits made on export coal should be employed to effect a reduction in the price of domestic coal and coal used by public utility companies for the production of household gas and electric light, but that there should be no reduction in the price of industrial coal. It would be far easier to administer this limited reduction than a reduction over the output of the whole industry.

As regards bunker coal, this was sold at world-prices, except in the case of the United Kingdom coastwise trade. This trade was allowed to purchase coal at prices which, although less than world-prices, were still very high. He thought that it would be advisable to reduce the price of coastwise bunkers, as such a reduction would diminish the amount of the subsidy at present being paid to coastwise shipping by the Ministry of Transport under the scheme for diverting traffic from the railways to the coasting trade. As regards foreign-going ships, he understood that in the previous week bunkers cost from 105/- to 107/- per ton, as compared with 10/- per ton pre-war rates. This enormous increase in price naturally raised the cost of goods, and made do it very difficult for a large number of liners to pay their way. The Shipping Controller feared that he would have to call on the Treasury to make good the difference between the Blue-Book Rates (which were based on an assumed rate of 35/- per ton for cost of coal) and the actual cost of running to shipowners. On the whole, he thought that the House of Commons might be informed that the output of coal is rising so much that action would be taken on the following lines :-

(i) The price of domestic coal would be reduced by 10/- a ton, and a similar reduction would be made in the price of coal used for the production of household gas and electricity:

(ii) The price of coastwise bunkers would be reduced:


(iii) The price of bunkers for foreign-.-going ships would be reduced in cases where the ship3had he en chartered or requisitioned by theBrut i sh Got *r nr.ont 8A general discussion followed;  during the -course ofwhich it was agreed thrt, while the letter of the Governmentsundertaking in July did not call for any reduction in theprice of coal,  the  spirit  of that undertaking did require areduction,    It to   also pointed out that the minerr fouldundoubtedly point to that undertaking and aecure the Govern-ment of making huge profits out of the 6/-  in crease e    Theincrease had been required to make coal pay its way.;,  and inthe face of the profit  on export  coal it  could not bo nain-t obtained.The Conference decided(a) That a statement should be mnde in the Houseof Corn one to the effect that the positionin the ccal-raining industry had so improvedthat  a reduction could now he ma do in theprice of the following varieties of coal(i)  Dcnrastie coa.1 and coal used for theproduction of household gas an electricity       a reduction of L0/**a. ton-i ifv) Coastwise bunkers       a sufficient reduction to neutralise the subsidy now being paidto the coasting trade  :bill) 3Porelgn-going bunkers  - a -reductionin tho case of bunkers supplied to ships  chartered or requisitioned bythe British GovernmentcThe statement  should make it clear&apos; that theGovernment hud thought it well to reduce theprice of coal in cases where the reduction would have the most direct -effect on the costof living, but t&quot; at in   the Government&quot; s opinionit was not possible to reduce the price of allcoal consumed in tho United Kingdom.(b) That the export of coal should be limited,in order to prevent foreign countries fromdenuding this  country of cord supplies:(c) That  coal-owners&apos;&apos; profits should be limited:(d) That there should bo a strict limitation onthe domestic use of coal-.(c)  That a scheme should be prepared to makeeach coal-producing district self-supporting,so as to eliminat &quot;  the present discrepancybct--c.cn profits In diff-rent areas.:
