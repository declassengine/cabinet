&apos; HE OBSERVANCE     (4) The Cabinet had before them a proposal that AND THE Ai-mi-^U7RSARY OP THE entire pause, throughout the United Kingdom, of three tain-SyifidlSTICE .utes should be made on Tuesday, November 11th, at 11.0 sum.in obiamemoration of the Armistice.    The proposal was accom-panied by a Memorandum by Sir Percy Pitapatrick, giving an account of a similar procedure which had been adopted inSouth Africa (Paper CP.-45).On the understanding that the suggestion was accept-j able to His Majesty the King, the Cabinet decided - (a) That the advantage cf the realisation by thenation of the magnitude of its deliverancefrom the great perils of the ;far outweighedthe main objection that a precedent would beestablished, which, in remote years, after thepassing of the present generation, might conceivably prove inconvenient:(b) That a pause of three minutes would involvetoo great a strain and. inconvenience, and thata pause cybne minute, as adopted in thePnited States of America on the occasion of president Roosevelt*s funeral and on other occasions, would be more impressive:(c) That no more appropriate moment for a pause,as a tribute to the dead, could be found thanthe anniversary of the cessation of fighting on the western Front, namely, the eleventhhour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month:(d) That the principle of a pause of one minute onthat date should therefore be adopted, providedthat there were no insuperable technical dif-ficu11iea invclved:(e) That a Cabinet Committee,  composed ofLord Milner (in the Chair),The Lord President of the Council,The Home Secretary,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Transport,The Minister of Labour,Lieut.-Col. 1*. Storr (Secretary),should meet the same afternoon to examine the feasibility of the proposal, and, if foundfeasible, to organise and co-ordinate thenecessary action:(f) That, in the event of the scheme being adopted,the Secretary Of State for the Colonies should,take the necessary action to inform the self-governing Dominions and all carts of the BritishEmpire, with a view to corresponding action sofar as practicable:    that the Secretary of statefor India should take similar action as re^rdsthe Indian Rmpire; **^*bb
(g) That^ the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.   &quot;&apos;who had a command to lunch at Buckingham.&apos; Palaceshould take this immediate opportunity to cbm-&quot;&apos;*municate the Cabinet&apos;s decision to the Kin?? andto ascertain His Majesty&apos;s pleasure as to the &apos;expediency of issuing a message on the subjectfrom the King to his People.(5) The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Labour, asking for an immediate decision asregards Out-of-work Donation, the scheme for which will cometo an end on November 34th next, so far as it affects allcivilian workers, as well as a certain number of Service men(Paper G.P.- 4).The alternative courses proposed in this Memorandumwere as follows:-(a) To make no extension at all in theDonation Scheme:(b) To extend it for ex-members of HisMajesty&apos;s Forces only:(e) To extend it both for ex-members of HisMajesty&apos;s Forces and for civilians.After considering the various objections to Out-of-Work Donation, namely, that it, tends to demoralise the people and to encourage idleness:    that it removes the incentive towork provided by the knowledge that men out-of-work are avail-able and consequently tends to encourage ca&apos;canny methods;that, from the point of view of finance, the grant of thisDonation handicaps the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;a appealsfor loans:   and that the migration of men from one trade toanother, such as, at the present time, from shipbuilding tothe building trade, is discouraged, and notwithstanding that unemployment at the present time is less than it was at any period during the War, the Cabinet felt that the existenceop     large body of unemployed ex-sailors, soldiers and airmen without any means of subsistence during the winter months would not be justifiable or defensible- It was agreed-(a) That the issue of the Out-of-^ork Donationto unemployed ex-sailors, soldiers and airmenshould be continued after November 24th:
(b) That the rats of payment of the Donation shouldnot be more generous than the rate contemplatedfor the eventual scheme of Unemployment Insurance.The rate must not be so high as to involve a contribution from workmen and employers which,in conjunction with the compulsory contribution for Health Insurance, would impose an unbearableburden.    Subject to further examination by theMinister of Labour, a rate of Donation of 15/-a week for single ex-sailors, soldiers and airmen, and 151/- a week for women, was eonsid-e red suitable;(a) That the Allowance for Children should be dis-continued:(d) To reserve for further discussion on the follow-ing day the question of an increased rate ofDonation to married men of (say) SO/- a week:(e) To reserve for consideration on the following day the question of the continued payment,after November 24th, of Out-cf-Tork Donationto civilian workers generally:(f) To reserve for further consideration on thefollowing day the question of treatingindependently of other civilian workers the employees of the Royal Dockyards and similarlysituated establishments.      It was recognisedthat a case could be made out for separatetreatment for these workers, on the -groundthat these establishments have been created and built up, and the populations surroundingthem called into being many years ago, aspart of our preparations for war, and thatthe effect of the sudden cessation of workin these establishments is increased by thefact that housina accommodation does not exist in the other industrial centres whereotherwise work might be found.      It was further recognised, however, that it was extremely difficult to separate the workersin these&quot;State factories from the workers in private factories which had been performingequally important war-work.The Cabinet took note of the Draft Conclusionsof a Conference, with the Prime Minister inthe Chair, held at 10, Downing Street, S.W.1,on Friday, October 31st.

7/:L OP (1) The question was raised as to what members of the .-IMPERIALSTY THE        0: binet should meet His Imperial Majesty the Shah of PersiaOF PERSIA*on his arrival in London, and after a short discussion-the Conference decided that -The Br&amp;Eje SS&amp;ayLsfcer, the Lord President  . .of the Council, the Seoretary of State&apos;.,for Foreign Affairs, and the secretary of State for Home Affairs should meet His.Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia onhis arrival at &quot;victoria Station that&amp;fternocmif &apos;,fI0 POLIO?   .    (2) With reference to War Cabinet 624, Minute 1, theINS THE[LNG V/IKTLR. Conference had under consideration an Admiralty Memorandum(Paper G.T.-64.09) asking for directions as to the policy to be pursued in the Baltic during the coming winter./ discussion took place regarding the action whichhad been taken up to date by the British ships in theBel tic, during which the prime Minister expressed theopinion that the bombardment at long range of forts onshore was doing more harm than good to British interests.The Seoretary of State for War deprecated any pro-posal to issue instructions for the immediate cessation ofthese bombardments until such time as it was practicable to ascertain the exact situation at the moment.The Conference decided that -(ft) The Admiralty should instruct the senior naval Officer, Baltic, when forced h$climatic reasons to evacuate the gulf of Finland, to withdraw to England the3.W. whnle of the British $aval forces, withIfW. the exception of ,-.t small force to showIS. the Flag in the Baltic?(b) The force to be retained in the Balticto show the Flag should be as small as
possible, and the Admiralty should sub-mit for consideration details as to the size of the force v/hich it is proposedto maintain for this purpose :(c) The Secretary of State for War should ascertain, and report to the Prime Min-ister,  the exact situation at the momenton *he left Mahk of the foroes operating against petrograd,  and the extent to whiohany order for the immediate cessation ofthe co-operation of the British Fleetmight affect this situation.. FUTURE      (S) With reference to War Cabinet 619, Minute 1, a shortTURKEY.discussion took place regarding the desirability of consider-ing the Turkish situation, during which the Prime minister pointed out that it was becoming clear that the UnitedStates of America would not be prepared to accept a mandate,and that it was very desirable that the whole question should be considered by the Cabinet at an early date.The Conference decided that -/  discussion on the general Turkishsituation should take place at anearls1 date.In the meantime,  the Secretary of Statefor Foreign A  fairs undertook toexamine the whole situation from thepoint of view of the latest information available, and to submit a Memoran-dum for consideration.fU^TRIAL (4) The Conference had under consideration a MemorandumRTS BILL.by the Minister of Labour (Paper CP.-6) covering a draftof the Industrial Courts Bill.It was explained that while,  on the one hand, workmenwere agitated at the prospect of wages being reduced, andwere claiming that war advances should continue in spite ofa possible fall in the price of food, employers were anxious for a definite period of stable wages,  .&apos;-;nd did not thinkthat food could fall by the autumn of 192C.    Provisionhad therefore been made to continue wages at the level at
which, thoy s.tood at the time of the Armistice until September30,  1920,  unless altered by agreement or voluntary arbitra-tiorm    and, at the same time, by abolishing compulsory arbitration,  to remove the anomaly by which employers could be compelled to go to arbitration when no such compulsioncould bo exorcised upon the workmen.    Provision was made fora permanent Court of Arbitration.She opinion was expressed that a big fight would bocaused by the clause in the draft Eill providing that, wherevoluntary arbitration had been agreed upon, a strifeo within four months against the-&apos; award made at such arbitration shouldbe illegal,  and that the Trades. Diaputoa Act should not apply.It was pointed out, on the other hand, that,  as the reference to arbitration would be purely voluntary,  it wouldbo only fair that the parties should be hold bound to honourtheir agreement to abide by the result of tho arbitration.Reference was also made to the fact that in some parts ofthe country thoro had recently boon frequent -strikes of school teachers, and it was pointed out that it might be a relief to the Local Authorities and to the Board of Educationif teachers could have recourse to the arbitration procedureprovided by the Bill.The Confcronco docidod -(a) To approve tho Draft Bill.(b) That it should be left to tho Minister ofLabour,  after conferring with the Labourleadcro,  to settle the point with regardto the clause in *he Bill making it illegalto strike against an award in an arbitrationwhich had boon voluntarily entered into:(a)    That the Minister cf Labour should confer with the President of tho Board of Educationwith regard to the insertion of a clause toinclude teachers in the Bill.(5)    With reference to War Cablnot 635, Minute 5,  theConference had under consideration a Memorandum by the FoodController (paper G.T..- 8382) and a Koto by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (P^per G.T.-8391).
-4-The Chancellor of tho Exchequer stated that,  accordingto tho Minutes,  tho Wax Cabinet had referred to the finance committee the question of an increase in tho retail priceof sugar.    At the Finance Committee, which mot on tho follow-iug day, there had been no time to discuss tho question of sugar, and consequently no decision had yet been come to asto whether the price should be raised.Some discussion took place,  during which it was pointedout&apos; that a riso in price would be inevitable after March 31of next year, and that sugar was at present being subsidisedout of past profits.    It was also suggested that an immediate increase of 2d per pound should be made in place of tho Id.as recommended by tho Food Controller.Attention was drawn to  tho Table of Distribution of sugar,  at the end of the Memorandum by the Food Controller(Paper G. T.-8382) ,- in which, while jam manufacturers would receive only 130,000 tons it  1920,  other manufacturers would receive n much as 250,000 tons.    It was suggested that therewas no justification for cutting down sugar supplies andraising the price of sugar for jam and domestic purposes ifmanufacturers of swocts wore allowed so largo a proportion.On tho other hand, it was pointed out that tho allocation to &quot;other manufacturers&quot; included not only sweet-makers butbakoro and minoral-water manufacturers, and all other users of sugar except condensed milk manufacturers and brewers;  thattho industries in question employed a largo amount of labour;and that the effect of drastic reduction would be severelyfolt amongst tho small retailers, as had boon the case in 191SThe Conference decided -(a) To approve the increase in tho retail pricoof sugar by Id per pound:(b) To request the Minister of Food and theChairman of the Sugar Commission to re-consider the allocation of sugar supplies,in the light of the oritici3ms at theConference,  mid for this purpose to confer with the Minister of Health.
BITEOGEE (6)    The Conference had under consideration twoPRODUCTS. Of]Memoranda &quot;by the Minister of Munitions;    the first oftheso  (Paper G.T.-7466) covered the Final Report of the Kit &quot;ogen Products Committee;    the second (Paper CP.-2)set forth the actual financial position of His Majesty&apos;sHitrogen Factory at Biliingham-on-Te.es, and gave particulars of an offer from Messrs. Brunner., Mond &amp; Co.acting on behalf of a syndicate.After a discussion,  the Conference decided -(u)    To accept the principle that the futured development of the Government1 a schemefor the fixation of nitrogen from the atmosphere and for combining nitrogen so obtained and hydrogen for the productionof ammonia and obtaining therefore nitricacid and ammonium nitrate should be leftto a commercial undertaking,  subject tothe Government interests in the productionof nivric acid and ammonium nitrate for service explosives being safeguarded0(b) That the fact that the Billingham Factorysite is available for disposal,  for theproduction of synthetic ammonia by privateenterprise, should be publicly announcedforthwith.(c) That the Report of the Nitrogen ProductsCommittee should bo published at once,(d) To authorise the Minister of munitions to disclose to the British chemicalmanufacturers such seeret processes,patented by the Department during thewar, as may be considered of value tothe chemical industry of the country.(a,    That negotiations with the Brunner MondSyndicate should,  in the meantime, bopursued on tho lines indicated in lordInvorforth1s Memorandum of the 27th October,1919, with the object of obtaining an in-creasedmonetary payment, subject to theapproval of the Treasury as to the precise terms, and to a satisfactory arrangementbeing reached as regards the electrical power agreement.(f)    That the terms of the agreement with thoSyndicate or other British purchaser should secure that a definite output of nitric acidwill bo available as soon as possible, andalso that the Government should have a lionon the Lyndicate&apos;s, or other purchaser&apos;smanufacturing capacity in the event of anational emergency.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I..October 31,  1919.. -5-
