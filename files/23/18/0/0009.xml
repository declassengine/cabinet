TVYT TTM&apos;&quot; BLOCKADE (1) Attention was called to the larse number of QuestionsOP  RUSSIA.addressed to the Prime Minister on the subject of the Blcck-ade of Russia, including the following Question by lord robert cecil:-&quot;To ask. the Prime Minister whether the blockade of Russian ports is still in force;    if not,when orders were given for its removal;   and what were the terms of those ordsrs&quot;,A draft answer to this Question, prepared, in the ForeignOffice, vas read to the Cabinet, to the effect that theAllied $aval Forces had been ordered to turn back shipsmaking for Russian Baltic ports, but that the question wasnew solved by natural causes (namely, the forming of the ice).It was generally felt that this reply was unsatlsf&amp;c-*tory, since the turning back of ships appeared to amount to a blockade, and it transpired that not only ships carryingw^r material&apos; to the Bolshevist forces had been turned back,out whips carrying food for those forces *It was agreed that   .Lr B&amp;balfour, after consultation with anofficial from the Foreign Office as tothe facts of the matter, should prepare a draff- reply for the Prime Minister*sconsidsrat ion.In regard to another Question, asking whether, whenthe ice melted, orders would be Issued to relax the blockade,it was generally agreed that, unless there should be some change in the present situation, the blockade should not be    IIre-instituted.. &apos;    IHOtfRS OF (&amp;) With reference to Conclusion 4 of a Conference heldon November IB, 1919, the Cabinet had before them the follow-ing documents on the subject of the Hours of Employment bill ;^A Memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland( Pap.er C. P. --g? )A Memorandum by the president of the Board ofAgriculture and Fisheries (Paper CP.-$1),A Menaors.nd.uiSi by the Chief Secretary for ireland (Pager C.P.-1S3).
As the Minister of Transport wished to raise a new consideration in regard to this Bill, and as the question was reported not to be of immediate, urgency, the Cabinet agreed  -

To postpone consideration of the question until the following week.



HOUSING POLICY.



    (3) With reference to Cabinet 7 (19), Conclusion 1, the Cabinet resumed their consideration of Housing Policy, and had before them the following documents :-

The Interim Report of the Cabinet Committee(Paper C.P.-153).

A first draft of a Bill, prepared in the Ministry of Health, to carry out the recommendations  of the Committee(Paper C.P.-153 A), which had not yet been before the Cabinet Committee.

The Draft Conclusions of a Meeting of the Cabinet Committee held on November 18, 1919 (Paper C.P.-153A), which had not yet been before the Cabinet Committee. The Draft Conclusions of a meeting of the Cabinet Committee held on November 18, 1919 (Paper C.H.C.- 4th Minutes).  Criticism of the Cabinet Committee&apos;s proposal was mainly confined to finance and the proposed powers to the Ministry of Health to prohibit during a given terms the construction of buildings of a non-essential character. 

Finance of the Housing Scheme.

(4) The Minister of Health asked that his opinion might be placed on record that, whether the suggestion that money for Housing Schemes should be raised locally by the issue of small Bonds, which had been referred to Mr Goschen&apos;s Committee, should prove feasible or not, he was convinced that the State would have to help materially in financing some of the Local Authorities, or else in the localities concerned no houses would be built.

The Cabinet were then given a full account of the difficulties which the Treasury would meet in rendering assistance to local Authorities beyond what had already been, agreed to. It was pointed out that the estimated amount required from the State for the assistance of Local Authorities with




a total rateable value of lose than &amp;&amp;OSyOQ0 would he 30,000,000 by September next,   in the following two yearsths estimate was for a further 5150,000,000.   To provide this the Treasury would have tc draw on the Local Loans Fund,which, however, only had liquid assets amounting to  15,000,00^1and this Fund hiad to provide for many other demands.   Prasti-cally, therefore, the Treasury was already cosamltted toamounts totalling about  60,000,000 in the next ten months and  150,000,000 in the two following years.   The bestopinion in ths City bad been consulted, and w&amp;s found tocoincide with the view of the Treasury,.namely, that at thepresent moment the Government could not borrow any mere money.Possibly the situation jraight be better in March or April,when the revenue had been collected, and particularly if theestimates of revenue were found to balance expenditure, but no definite opinion could be obtained as to the prospects,it was suggested that the Local Authorities, some of whom had not much experience in raising money, ought to be ableto raise all that was required on their own credit by theissue of some special Bonds such as were now under consider-eration by hr Go ache n* a Committee.    It was pointed out thatthe adoption of some such scheme of local Bond issue wouldhave an important political effect, since it would shift tothe Local Authorities the burden of responsibility for pro-dueing houses which was now generally laid on the Government.The Cabinet generally accepted the view that in any event no encouragement ought to be held out to the LocalAuthorities with a rating of over   00,000 that the Statecould offer thorn any assistance.    If this - were done, in somecases no real effort would be made - by the Local authorities themselves.    In no case should the grant of State credit facilities to such Local Authorities be even considered
except as a last resort after every possible method of raising the money had beer? thoroughly explored by the LocalAuthorities theiss elves and found non-productive.Luxury (5) The proposal that the Ministry of Health should heBuilding.equipped with powers to prohibit during a given tersa theconstruction of buildings of a non-essential character ineases where t)u- construction of such buildings was restrict-ing the building of houses, was subjected to sojsss criticism.It was pointed out that during the 8ar, when first the Min-&apos;- istry of $ unit ions and subsequently the 1&apos;inlstiry &apos;of nationalService had been equipped with sliailar powers, they had beenfound most difficult and irksome to administer withoutseriously hampering trade.   At the present time, when theState ought to give ever;-/ eneouragersent and impetus to there-opening of trade and industry, these difficulties would prove even greater.   Por example, the stoppage of the build-in r. of cinematograph theatres would inevitably react on thecinema industry, including the production of lenses by theoptical industry, which was one of the hey industries we were trying to foster.   Also, a prohibition on the demolition ofhouses for the extension of factories which would give ersr-ployjtaent to labour in a district where surplus labour was available, would, it was contended, be economically unsound.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the demolition ofhouses, even for the, extension of a factory, and the diversion of labour to the provision of places of entertainment, parti-culayly in neighbourhoods where there was a shortage of houses.Shocked public opinion and would not be tolerated.    above all, public opinion would not stand people being evictedfrom decent houses for the construction of places of enter-tsinment.    Such action raised political issues of the first jorder.     Attention was drawn to the importance of safeguarding
the construction of schools.        500 places were required,immediately in Elementary Schools, and 40,000 places in secondary Schools.   For the encouragement of Local Author!-ties who wore active in educational matters, the importance was urtped of a public statement to the effect that the build-:inr? of schools would not be held up, .There was general agreement that some powers were necessary to prevent the excessive diversion of labour toluxury building.    For example, it was generally recognisedthat power should exist for preventing the diversion of labour from carrying out a Housing Scheme to the extension and im-provement of the residences of wealthy persona.    Further,it was generally agreed thai it. would be inconsistent forthe State, while continually urging Local Authorities to push on with the housing Scheme, to decline to assist themto obtain the necessary labour when this was actually being used in their districts for non-essential luxury building.The suggestion was made that the difficulty slight be surmounted by importing a different class of labour to build a different type of house, several of which had been referred-  to at the last Cabinet Meeting.The proposals of.the Committee were approved inprinciple, but it was &apos;agreed that the framing of the neces-sary legislation would require very careful drafting in orderto reconcile the moral with the economical aspect of thequestion.   This task, was remitted tc the Cabinet HousingCoiasittee.onclxisiona. (6) The Cabinet agreed -(a) To accept the recommendation of the CabinetComisittee that a subsidy should he granted,to private enterprise on the lines set forth in the.Memorandum by the Minister of Health(Paper CP.-94), namely, a subsidy not exceed-ing  150 per house of approved type and lay-out,up to a limit of 100,000 houses to be completed-within the next twelve months
(b) To accept the proposal of the Cabinet Committeeand the Minister of Health, providing for theoperation-of&apos;the agreements reached with theBuilding $r&amp;de, on &quot;the understanding that theagreement with the House Builders under SeetionIS (3) of the Housing Aet will be worked so asto secure a good type of house and not to eon-flist with the subsidy arrangementi(c) To aoceot the proposal of the Cabinet Concaitteeand the Frevident of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries that* subject to the provisionsof the dousing Acts, and after opportunity hasbeen afforded to County Councils to help, the -Board of Agriculture shall be called upon toassist the Ministry of Health in oases - ofdefaulting rural authoritiest(d) To approve in principle, and subject to asuitable formula being found for reconciling the conflicting xsoral and econorsie considers-tions, the proposal - of the Cabinet Oota:oitteethat the Ministry of Health should be equipped with powers to prohibit during a given term the construction of ,btxil dings of a non-essential0 ha raster in oases where the cons tract ion ofauch buildings was restricting the building ofhousess   the draft of the necessary legislation to be carefully eonsidered by the Cabinet HousingCo&amp;fcs&amp;ttee in consultation with the President ofthe Board of Trade or his representativest(e) r?o aesept the proposal of the Cabinet Oosa-ssittee that the Ministry of Health should be equipped with powers to prohibit the deraoli-tion or the putting out of use of existing,habitable houses:(f) To accept the decision of the Cabinet Com-aslttee that, in the ease of a Local Authoritywhioh, although not technically in default,was at the tine not active in caiying outSinister ofshould be granted authority (in pursuance ofSection IS of the.1919 Act) to prescribe thatworks undertaken by the Ministry to supplement the housing scheme of such a Local authority should fovffi a part, for financial purposes, ofthe local scheme?,   this authority, however,to be confined to cases of the conversion ofexisting houses and of emergency accommodation,(g) To take note of the following action taken orc mIt of the examin&amp;ller.of the question of housing, finance by a SulComities of the Housing committees-(i) fhat the Treasury had written toHr Coschen asking his Committeeto examine carefully and presentan Interim Report at the earliestpossible date on the suggestionthat Money for housing scbemesshould be raised locally by the. issue of small Bonds which would
at a later date be accepted in payment for houses should the holder of the Bonds so desire,and which the working-classes inparticular should be encouraged to buy hy the initiation ofvigorous campaigns and by other methods in support of them.(11) That the Minister of Health andthe Secretary for Scotland should examine carefully the cases of allthose1 Authorities whose schemes were said to be held up on accountof their inability to raise thenecessary money&apos;   that the list ofsuch Authorities should be cut down*e an absolute mlnimom, containingonly those which Dr. Addison and Uv?!unrc were satisfied had done every-thing in their power to raise theconey and still had failed to do so.5that in each case an estimate shouldbe made of the immediate and, pro see stive&apos;liability of the Treasury if.it were decided to grant these AuthoritiesSt ate aid in order to proceed withtheir schemes t   and that this list should, then be considered as abeo-lutely fine,! and should-be submittedto the Chancellor of the Exchequerf o r c on s i de rat i on.To take note cf the arrangement made betweenthe Minister of Health and the Chancellor ofthe &quot;Exchequer whereby, in the Pebate on thefollowing days, the former should mke itperfectly clear that local Authorities were entirely incorrect if they believed that the -State was in a better-1 position, than they ^ereto undertake the financial responsibility forraisin^ money to carry out, their housingschemes?   that in fact the Local Authorities,if the-? would only raise money on their owncredit, wore in a better position for thisthan the State, whose credit had been soheavily drawn upon by the ffar;   that theGovernment&apos; hoped in the near future to sug-gest some form of Bend which could be issuedlocally and on the security cf the LocalAuthority to raise the money;   and, finally,that the Government hoped to be in a positionto advise the Local Authorities as to thebest means of popularising the scheme:(i) To approve the following proposals of theCabinet Housing Ooinsoittee:-That the Prlxaa Minister be asked to address a meeting of the principal Pjaployera andTrade Unions in the Building Trades, inorder- to urge the a - 
(i) To co-operate on fair terms in carrying out the National Housing Programme, giving it in each district a fair measure of priority in their efforts:

(ii) In carrying out the National Housing Programme, to revert to pre-War methods and remove all trade restrictions - this to be accompanied by a guarantee against the cutting down of piece rates, etc.

(iii) To facilitate the admission into the different branches of the trade of adult workers under a short-term training system, especially of men who have served in the War, due regard being had to the preservation of standards of skill in the trade; effect until a decision is reached on the 4th recommendation of the Cabinet Housing Committee, which is dealt with in the following conclusion.

(j) To prefer back (since this question did not arise in connection with the Debate on the following day) for the consideration of the Cabinet Housing Committee, in consultation with the Treasury, their proposal that, in order to meet any increased risk of unemployment benefit charges falling on Trade Union funds by reason of the employment of additional men, the Government should pay into the Trade Union funds for the period of three years a weekly contribution equivalent to 50 per cent, of the rate paid by the ordinary members of the Union, in respect of each of the men admitted to the short-term training scheme, preference to be given to ex-Service men:

(k) To refer to the Cabinet Housing Committee the Draft Bill to carry out the above proposals (Paper C.P.-153 A);

(l) That, as the new Housing Bill could not possibly be laid before the middle of next week, the discussion on Housing in Parliament on the following day should be raised by means of a proposal for the adjournment.



THE PRICE OF COAL.



(7) As a matter of urgency, the President of the Board of Trade invited the attention of the Cabinet to the following question relating to the price of coal.

When the price of coal had been raised by 6/- a ton the Government had given an undertaking that the price should be reduced as soon as possible. Although for some

  


time after the raising of the price coal had been worked ata loss, the deficit had been made good, and at the beginningof the month the aecounta balanced.    Output, subject to minorvariations, was? generally maintained.   The majority of thePita were worked at a loss, and this loss was only made goodby the fact that a minority, mainly engaged in producing coal for export, worked at a profit.   The result was that all thesmaller pits were subsidised.   If the price were now loweredthe result would be that the coal-pits In Lancashire, theMidlands and elsewhere, would be virtually bankrupt and theState would have to finance them.   The money realised by the pits engaged in the export trade, from which the subsidy tothese pits would have to be paid, would not be availableuntil some tists in the Hew Tear, and in the meantime it wasestimtsd that some  2.0,GOO,000 might have to be advanced by the State.   It was suggested that it wan too dangerous to have the whole of the coal industry subsidised by theprofits made on the export trade..   Per example, if the activity of js&amp;fe industry increased and the consumption ofcoal becase greater, and there was no corresponding rise- inthe amount derived from exports, the subsidy would proveinsufficient.   It was suggested that there should be ncreduction in the price of coal to industry-, which, in general,was making enormous profits notwithstanding the high pricesof coal, but the following proposals were madet-(1) -That there should be a limitation onexportv in order to prevent the countrybeing too mush drained of coal:(ii) That there&apos; should be a limitation onownsrs&quot; pre fits:(ill) That there should be a limitation on theprice of domestic coal, gas and electriclight, amounting to about 10/- a ton.The proposal was criticised on the ground that thefailure of the Government to reduce the price of coal wouldbe alleged as a breach of faith.
The Cabinet decide-&apos; that -A Cabinet Committoe, composed as followsThe Prime ministers the Lord Privy Seal,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Labour,Mr Stanley Baldwin (representing theChancellor cf theKxchequer),The Coal Controller,should meet at 11 a.m. in Mr Bonar Law&apos;sPoem at the House of Commons on the fol-lowing day to examine this question..CQWBKKMOSS (8) The Cabinet took note of the Conclusions of theOP * !

As regards permanent representation, it was agreed -That the question was one which would haveto be decided after discussion with our allies, a:nd,  if pressed by a SupplementaryQuestion,  the Leader of the House shouldmake an announcement to this effect.The question was then discussed as to which department should be the channel of communication between the Leagueof Lations and the British Government.It was clearly recognised that no question of Depart--mental responsibility was raised.      VJhiehever Office wasselected as the channel of communication,  the respensibil-ity of the Departments of State concerned in particularquestions must not be affected, and the Foreign Office,in particular, would be very closely concerned in a verylarge proportion of the matters that would arise..      Thequestion for consideration was therefore limited to which department should be the clearing-house for communicationsAfter considerable discussion,  the Conference agreedupon the following principles which should be applied insetting up the British organisation in connection with theLeague of Hatiorvs:-(1) All communications, whether to or from theLeague of Nations,  shall be sent;, for par-poses of distribution among GovernmentDepartments,  to a Central Office attachedto the Secretariat of the Cabinet,(2) All Government Departments concerned,  evenin a secondary way with these communicationsshall receive copies cf them.(3) The Foreign Office shall be deemed to be concerned, either in a primary or a secondary way, with all communications.(4) nothing in these Regulations shall beallowed to modify the traditional methodof Government by Cabinet, acting uponinformation and advice supplied&apos;by thevarious Cffioes.(5) The Distributing Office shall have no executive or advisory duties.(6) The Head of the Distributing Office,attached to the Cabinet Secretariat;,shall be nominated by the Prime Minister,,after consultation with the Seoretary ofState for Foreign Affairs,
It was further decided:-That, with the above principles as a basis for discussion,  the details of the organi-sation should be settled between theSecretary cf State for Foreign Affairs andthe Lord President of the Council..With regard to the point raised in Sir Eyre Crowe&apos;0telegram, referred to above,  the Conference decided -That the British Government should not agreeto any subje..t being discussed at the firstmeeting of the Council of the League addition-al to that for which the meeting had originally been summoned, namely.t the appointment of the saar Delimination Commission,, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.I.November 10th,  1919,

RUSSIAN POLICY.

(1) With reference to the Conference on November 11th the discussion on the question of British policy in Russia was continued.

A telegram was read from the British Mission at Vladivostok (No.6089), dated November 7th. 1919, containing the views held by General Gaida, the late Chief of Staff to Admiral Koltchak, on the situation.

It was reported that the only fresh news in connection with Russia was that General Donikin&apos;s negotiations with the Ruthenians had reached a satisfactory conclusion, which meant the securing of General Donikin&apos;s left flank; and further, that the navigation of the Volga was closed by ice, which, if true would secure the position in the Caspian.

In view of the fact that the Poles were antagonistic to the Ruthenians, it was felt that enquiry should be made as to what would be the effect on General Denikin&apos;s relations with Poland on his agreement with the Ruthenians.

During the discussion which ensured the C.I.C.S. expressed the opinion that the Finns could, if they wished, take Petrograd, but they were apparently only willing to make the attempt on conditions with which understood we could not comply. He did not think it would be possible to expel the German forces from the Baltic without using force, and there was no force to use. In his opinion the Germans had no intention of leaving the Baltic provinces. He was a little anxious about the seven British battalions

   

    


which were being sent into East Prussia.    He agreed with -what had been said by the 3/3 for War as regards the Bolshevist forcesbeing concentrated against General Denikin if the Baltic States and poland stopped fighting.      It seemed probable that Admiral Zolt-chak wOuld lose Omsk:    and incase  circumstances the Bolsheviks-would be able to withdraw forces&apos;not only from Earth but alsoEast Russia, and concentrate them against General Denikin. whowould probably be driven back.      This would inevitably have reflexactions upon the British positions in Persia, and Afghanistan,It would no doubt however take some time for the Bolsheviks to con-centra te their forces against General Denikin.      Personally he was afraid of the Germans and Bolsheviks coming to terms.    It was verydifficult tc say what was the strength of the German forces in theBaltic;  they might be anything from 2,0,000 tc 40,000 men,The trend of the discussion at the Conference may besummarised as follows:-(s.) Finland..Although the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff expressed the opinion that the Pirns,from a military point of vie v.,  could,  if they wished, occupy Petregrad; it was agreed that itwould be useless to put pressure on the finnish government to undertake the operation,  since they had made it clear that they would not doso without support from the Allies on a scale   ?.which the Allies were not in a position to give..(b)  Baltic Provinces.(i) That as regards influencing the Baltic Statesall  that could be done was to encourage thorn toact together,  and that as already-decided in thedespatch to the Baltic States approved by the WarCabinet  (War Cabinet 624(1) end&quot;Appendix III)they must be their own arbiters us to whethernegotiations with the Bolsheviks were entered intoor net.vii)  That the -situation was  very difficult in sofar as General Denikin;s aspirations were not thesame as those of the smaller States.,  and that itwas doubtful if we ought to encourage tho Bs.. t.lcStates to continue operations against the he&quot;1 sheviksin/
in order to relieve the pressure on general denikin, in view of the fact that the latter was not prepared to recognise the independenceclaimed by the St.-,tes,(c) Siberia,It was recognised that President rileon hadbeen very reluctant to interfere       Siberia, andthr.t the interests of the united States were mainly centred on keeping the Japanese in cheek andit was generally agreed that the British policy had already been decided, namely.,  to endeavour toget the Americans end Japt.ne.se to be responsiblefor supporting the anti-Bolshevist forces In this theatre.(d)    South Russia.It was pointed out thst South Russia couldnot be completely pacified by military meansalone,  and that its economic development was QiS.vital importance,  and with this object in view-Mr- Msckinler hud been appointed as British highCommissioner to GeneraltDenJJcin*   As regardssupport to General Denikin,  it was agreed thatthe policy had already been decided.(e) Persia and Central Asia.It wss generally agreed that the Bolshevistactivity in Persia and Central Asia was one ofthe most troublesome problems which the BritishEmpire had tc face.if) General.It was agreed that the German forces in theBaltic were in some ways or.?; greatest source of trouble, and that, although it was not possibleto prevent a certain amount of German penetrat-ion into Russia, if any re-modelling of a. unitedRussia were to take place in the future it was most essential that it should not be done by theGermans; and again it was pointed out that to turn the Germans out of the Baltic Provinces atthe present stage would to a certain extent assistthe Bolshevists.
With a view to further discussion on the subject, the Conference agreed that the following action should be taken:-

(i) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for War should each be asked to prepare a paper showing their conception of the aims of the German force in the Baltic Provinces, and giving, if possible, the size of the force, its apparent motives, and any available information about the attitude of the German Government towards the force and the powers of that Government to control it.

(ii) The Secretary of State for War should be asked to submit a memorandum for the consideration of the Cabinet, giving his proposals and explaining in what way, if any, he suggests that the Russian policy already approved by the Cabinet should be modified.

(iii) The Secretary of State for War should be asked to obtain particulars of the Agreement between General Denikin and the Ruthenians and get any information available as to the likely effect of this Agreement on General Denikin&apos;s relations with Poland.

(iv) The Eastern Committee, which should be attended by the Secretary of State for War, should be asked to consider the general situation in Central Asia, both from a political and military point of view and report to the Cabinet.

Baltic Policy during the coming Winter.

2. With reference to the Prime Minister&apos;s Conference on October 31st, the Conference had before them a Memorandum prepared in the Admiralty on the question of maintaining a Naval Force in the Baltic during the Winter 1919-20.

The First Sea Lord explained that if a small force were to be left in the Baltic, there was a possibility, in fact a strong probability of calls being made on this force by the various Baltic States for assistance: and that the refusal of such requests would without doubt lessen British prestige whereas acquiescence would inevitably lead to operations on an increasing scale, possibly culminating in the necessity of providing a force similar to that now there. Further, the expense of keeping even a small force in the Baltic would be considerable and it would be necessary to keep a similar number of ships in Home waters in order to arrange for its relief, as the conditions of service in the Baltic during the winter months would be serve and unpopular with the men. The Admiralty could,  however, provide a small force, if desired.

IRELAND DUBLIN METROPOLITAN POLICE.



With reference to Cabinet 6 (19) the Conference heard reports on the present state of Ireland from the following :-



General Sir F.C. Shaw, Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in Ireland. 

General Sir F. Byrne, Inspector-General, Royal Irish Constabulary.

Mr. T.J. Smith, Royal Irish Constabulary.

Col. Edgeworth  Johnstone, Chief Commissioner, Dublin Metropolitan Police.

These statements were to the effect that the proclaiming of Martial Law, either ever the whole of Ireland or in any part of Ireland, where an outrage had been committee, would be little real assistance in bringing murderers to trial and that no powers existed under Martial Law that had not existed under the Defence of the Realm Act. Under the latter it was not possible to inflict the death sentence except on the charge of treason. It was also stated that the changing of the venue of a trial from Dublin to Belfast would not be an absolute guarantee of the jury being free from intimidation. In addition, it was the opinion of the Police Experts that the deportation of murderers on suspicion would have a great effect in the country, but not so great as would be the case if conviction could be obtained in two or three cases and the murderes hanged.

With regard to the moral effect of these outrages in the Dublin Metropolitan Police, it was stated that on the whole force this was negligible, but that in regard to the Political Section of this body, which consisted of ten men only, it was having effect which was not surprising in view of the fact that out of this small number two men had been killed, one dangerously wounded and two had had attacks made upon them.

  




2...aAfter the vrlthdrawal of the experts, the Conferencecl the policy to be adopted and agreed : -(1)    That on the evidence before them,, the host wayto secure a cessation of murder v:as by the con-viction and tho Infliction of a capital sentenceon some of the murderera.(2)    That the delay involved In waiting until thenext assizes was undesirable and, in instances where a perfectly clear case existed, an earlier trial was desirable.(3)    That in two cases sufficient evidence which wouldnot be liable to fail through Intimidation wasforthcomings, to ensure a conviction.(4)    That the change of the place of trial from Dublinto Belfast, owing to the doubt as to whethera jury could he empanelled in Dublin which wouldconvict, provided no guarantee of convictionand was undesirable, more particularly a3 it involved removal from a Roman Catholic to aProtestant districts(5)    That a special tribunal of three judges shouldbe established for the trial of cases where a conviction was reasonably assured^(6)    That the necessary legislation to carry this out should be prepared for the consideration of theCabinet with a view to early introduction inparliament.   This legislation should include powerto dispense with unpaid magistrates and givopower to judges to try in camera *(7)    That a few suspected persons should be deportedfrom Ireland to Great Britain where they shouldbe Interned unless they could find some other.  country to harbour them, In which case their departure would be perr.itteda    The Irish Governmentshould have authority for tho immediate adoptionof this course a(8)    That the Irish Government withdraw the    ameliorationsand refuse to yield to hunger strikes In the case ofconvicted men.,Whitehall Gardens., .

FXAX CULTXVA-.   (1)     The Conference had under- consideration the JSIRELA3SD. following documentsCorrespondence between the president of theBoard of Trade and the chairman of the H&amp;meAffairs Committee (paper G.T. 8368),A Memorandum by the president of the Boardof Trade (Paper GoT, 7812).A Memorandum by the parliamentary Secretary,Board cf Agriculture and Fisheries(Paper G .T. 7926).A Memorandum by the chief Secretary farIreland (paper a J. 794c).Home Affairs Committee 39, Minute 1 and appendix-,from which it appeared that the Home Affairs Committeehad approved a Government guarantee for five years in respect of a scheme put forward by the Empire Flax-growing Committee for the encouragement of flax-growing in the South ef Ireland, under which two Com-panics might barrow  100*000 and  60,000 respectively,Of the profits, the Gevernmesit^would in each case taketwo-thirds and the Company erie-third, and at the end$f five years the Companies would have the right topurchase the buildings and machinery at one halfthe cost price.   The Treasury had been represented at the meeting, but subsequently, at the instance ofthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Treasury refusedL.B. tft sanction the proposal,  on the ground of principle.Ij m S aIt was pointed out by the Chancellor of theExchequer that he had stated la the House of commons that it was the policy of the Government to createno new feubsidies, and he therefore felt it impossibleto embark on a scheme of this kird trithout directCabinet decision.
Some discussion took place as to the operation ofthe guarantee given during the War to the flax-growers inthe North of Ireland,   in which it was pointed out that the substantial profit to which the Government were entitled under the terms of the guarantee had had to be given upovdnj to the refusal of the farmers to release their cropsunless the Government relinquished their share of the pro-fits.    It was    eu ;  ret ed that the linen industry and the farmers,   in consequence, had made enormous profits,  andthat the former oould well afford to advance the money for Eaakina a new experiment- tn the South of Ireland,    Qnthe ether hand,  it was pointed out that Government helphad been given to trade in various foms since theArmistice; that it was highly probable that political considerations would interfere to prevent the North fromcoming to the help of the South;  that,  as it would beimpossible for any supply of flax to come from Russiafor a very lon^ time,   any increase in the Irish flaxcrop would be of benefit to the &quot;whole trade of this countryand that we had for a long time been accustomed to give to the South of Ireland help in matters of this kind toa far greater extent than to any $ther part of the Kingdom.It was suggested,  however,   that the private promoters ofthe scheme ought  to bear a greater share of the risk byadvancing a much more substantial amount of the money required than was proposed in the present scheme,  andthat the proposal that they should be able to buy back the machinery and buildings at the end of five years athalf-price was inequitable.The Conference decided :-To approve in principle the proposals ofthe president of the Board of Trade fora scheme for the encouragement of flax-grtiTsdng in the South of Ireland (paper G.T.7812);  the details of the scheme
to be settled&apos; in consultation with theTreasuryj on the understanding that theprivate promoters concerned should bear amuch mare substantial proportion of therisk than had been contemplated.IR HUGH LANE 2SlGTTJRESa (2) The Conference had under. consi^eT^AOTX-^JJlemor^indumby the Chief Secretary for Ireland  (Paper GaT9-7823) Inwhich It was proposed that a Bill should he IntroducedelrhAh.Parliament in order to carry into effect the provisions ifan unwitnessed codicil tq the will of the late Sir hugh lane with regard to certain pictures of the ContinentaledSchool which had belong/to him and which were now in theNational Gallery in London, namely, that these picturesshould be vested in the Dublin Corporation; together with-a Memorandum from the Trustees of the National Gallery(Paper G.T.-8283) which opposed this proposal.In support cf the Chief Secretary&apos;s proposal; it wascontended(a) That it was the original intention of Sir hugh lane to leave his Collection tc the Duel.hiCorporation, hut that - owing to his iruitatlohwith that body regarding their refusal to conform to his wishes for the erection of aVenetian Gallery in Dublin for the housing ufthe pictures,,he bequeathed them in ieh.o tothe National Gallery in London.:    But. his- irritation with the Dublin Corporation beingovercome, he wrote in his own Viand, in 191S.the unwitnessed codicil bequealhirig the ih.-lection to the City of Dublin,, on the yeaeor...standing that a suitable building was ]h:\ -vided for them within five years cf has death;(b) That there was written evidence of, individuals- who had seen Sir Hugh Lane just before hugdeath; to whom he made it cp roe clear thathis intention was to leave the pictures tothe City of Dublin:(c) That&apos; the introduction of the suggested bill would not create a;bad precedent as regardsprivate wills.., inasmuch as fhis was a publiobenefaction made to the Irish nation;(d) That as the codicil was written in thetestator&apos;s own hand and put in an envelope,,sealed and addressed to his sister, fro hadcharge of  the main willthis showed thai-Sir Hugh Lane ohvicusly,thought that the-codicil was von id in lawcIt was not contehued that legally,the national gallery of London was not entitled to these pictures., hut it
was pointed out that, had the codicil been made in Scotlandinstead cf in England, it would have been valid in the eyes- - of the law.It was stated on the other hand(a)       That, apart from the uncontested legal claim of the Trustees of the National Gallery tothe pictures- there was very great doubt as toSir Hugh Lane&apos;a intention regarding the futureOf his Collection, inasmuch as up to the date *he sailed to America he was in constant ccuimu-communication with the Trustees of the National Galleryregarding tbe exhibition of his C&amp;llection afcthe Tate Gallery,    Also* that on the 24th March1915 (six weeks  after the codicil was made) SirHugh Lane did net mention his changed intention toMr. McCcllj, the Keeper cf the Wallace Col LectionIn addition, at the end of March, 1915, Sir hugh lane had a conversation with Mr Altken at mhich thesubject of the destination of the French pictures ragdefinitely raised, &amp;nd Sir Hugh Lane was told that the prospects for the provision of a Galleryin Linden for the permanent exhibition of his pictureswere good;   after which Sir Hugh Lane stated thathe  would wafS  for a result of the negetiations and finally decide according to the treatment he receivedfrom the authorities of London and Dublin respectivelyIt was also suggested that as Sir Hugh Lane was aman who constantly changed his iMj:^  it was impossibleto  ascertain what his real intentions were, andin view of this the only safe ground on which toproceed was the one laid doart by law.(b) That inasmuch  -as it was proposed to take away from the Trustees of the National Gallery, byAct &quot;if Parliament, what was theirs by lav, theNational Gallery waa being placed in a worse position than a private individual against whom no-rne fora moment ?&quot;ould propose to proceed in a case of thiskind.(c) Gre -t stress was laid on the bad effect which-ovli be produced if the State set the example ofover-riding the Intentions  set forth In a legallyattested will in favour of an instrument notlegally attested.(d) That outside evidence regarding the testator&apos;intention was acutely divided.One point- of view was that this ^as not a question to be decided on from the purely legal  standpoint., and Itwas denied that the law represented the real  substantialfacts of the case.-   In this connection it was contended thatthe e-hole of English and Irish public opinion v-ould be Infavour of carrying out the testator&quot;s desire expressed inthe codicil,
It was suggested that the following might be used asa preamble to the Bill proposed by the Chief Secretary:-&quot;Whereas certain pictures belonging to the lateSir Hugh Lane have been left to the national gallery and now belong to the Trustees of that body who represent tho Nation and whereas there seems to be some doubt.as to what were tho finalviews of Sir Hugh Lane on the destination ofthe pictures Parliament hereby decides to trans-fer from the Trustees of the National GalleryIn London to the Trustees of the MunicipalGallery in Dublin the future custody and legalpossession of the said pictures&quot;aIt was pointed out, however;, that the Trustees ofthe National Gallery, after carefully considering all theevidence both for and against the question whether thecodicil represented the last wishes of Sir Hugh Lane, had come to the conclusion that it was not borne out by thefacts, and that to give effect to such a codicil would, inthe circumstances3 defeat and not carry out Sir Hugh Lane1slast wishes:    also, that the Trustees felt it incumbent on them to oppose any steps that were taken to make it legal,by Act of Parliament, to transfer .the Collection to Dublin,The Conference decided by a majority )-That it was undesirable to take any stepsby Act of Parliament to depart from theintention expressed in the will of Sir hugh lane to leave his collection of ContinentalFictures to the National Gallery in LondonsI-LATERAL (3) The Conference had under consideration a letter fromC-REEMENTETWEEN Mr. Balfour to Lord Curzon,  covering a draft of a bi-lateralBEAT BRI-Lll\ AND Treaty between His Majesty 5 s Government and Greece (PaperuEECE. that.-136), asking/the Treaty should he formally approvedby His Majesty&apos;s Government and submitted to the GreekMinister in London for the approval of the Greek Government;and a Note by the Under Secretary for State for Foreign affairs to the Secretary of the Cabinet (Paper C..P.-5C) asking whether the Cabinet had any observations to make in regardto the draft Agreement, and reporting that the Board ofTrade had requested th&amp;t the remaining negotiations Inregard to this bi-lateral Treaty and those to be concluded
