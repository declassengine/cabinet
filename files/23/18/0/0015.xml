THE GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND BILL

Parliamentary Procedure.

(i) With reference to Cabinet 18 (19), Conclusion 17, the Cabinet considered the question of the method of proceeding with the Government of Ireland Bill in the House of Commons this Session.

Two alternative Proposals were made:-

(i) To introduce the Bill, which could, by dint of great efforts, be ready by next week:

(ii) For a statement to be made giving the general outlines of the Government&apos;s proposals without actually laying the Bill.

It was suggested that the former course would have the disadvantage of exposing the Bill for two months to criticism and misrepresentation, without the opportunity for immediate reply which is given when Parliament is sitting. Even if perfect in draughtsmanship and in detail, it was recognised that the Bill would encounter great difficulties; there was, however, the danger that some crudity in some detail of the Bill, which had not yet been discovered, might come to light and might be fastened upon in order to ridicule and destroy the Bill.

On the other hand, by adopting the second alternative it was pointed out that it would be easy to modify the Bill to meet any sound criticisms that were made on the general proposals. Another advantage urged in favour of adopting the second alternative was that Irish politicians of more than one shade of opinion had strongly urged that whatever Bill the Government introduced should be proceeded with in order to reach a settlement of the question.

The Cabinet agreed:

(a) That the Government of Ireland Bill should not be introduced this Session:
(b) That an announcement should be made by the Prime Minister in Parliament the same afternoon in the following sense:-

"Owing to the Preoccupation of the Government over preparations for and the discussions at the series of International Conference just concluded, I am afraid I cannot make a statement on the Irish proposals of the Government this week, but hope to be in a position to do so on Monday next. As the House rises on Tuesday for some weeks, and no further progress could possibly be made with a Bill this Session, the Government thought it would conduce to more effective progress with this troubled problem if their proposals were placed now in outline before the country, with a view to the introduction of the measure early next Session".

COMPOSITION OF THE NORTHERN PARLIAMENT.

Ulster or the Six Counties?

(2) With reference to Cabinet 12 (19), Conclusion 12, the Cabinet were informed that further conversations. With the Ulster leaders had confirmed that they were doubtful whether the Northern Parliament of Ireland would be able effectively to govern the three Ulster Countries where there was a Nationslist majority, and greatly preferred that the scheme should be applied only to the six protestant countries. Sir James Craig, in a private conversation with Sir Laming Worthington-Evans, had suggested the establishment of a Boundary Commission to examine the distribution of population along the borders of the whole of the six Counties, and to take a vote in those districts on either side of an immediately adjoining that boundary in which there was a doubt as to whether they would prefer to be included in the Northern or the Southern Parliamentary Area.

It was pointed out that this procedure would be in consonance with the principles and practice adopted at the Peace Conference, where, whenever possible, the boundary had been adjusted on ethnological grounds. It was recognised that in Ireland, as in most of the cases dealt with by the


Peace Conference, it would be impossible to avoid the inclusion of isolated districts inhabited by Protestants in the Southern Parliamentary Area, and, vice versa, the inclusion of Roman Catholic districts in the Northern Parliamentary Area.

The Cabinet referred the question for examination by Mr Long&apos;s Cabinet Committee.

THE REGENT ALLIED CONFERENCES IN LONDON.

(3) With reference to Cabinet 13 (19), the Cabinet took note of the Resolutions adopted at the recent Conferences of the Allied and Associated Powers, and of the British and French Governments, held in London (Appendix I).

PUBLICATION OF THE RESULTS OF THE CONFERENCES.

Russia. The Baltic States. Peace with Turkey. Peace with Hungary. Economic and Financial Situation. French Loan. The Future of the Peace Conference. The Adriatic.

(4) Some discussion took place as to the nature of the announcement to be made in regard to the recent Conferences. It was pointed out in this connection that the greater publicity which was sometimes given in foreign countries in regard to these Conferences caused some feeling in the British Parliament. It was explained, however, that on the present occasion the most important subject of public interest had been in regard to Russia. There had already been several Debates in Parliament on this subject, and the British Government had given much more information in regard to it than had been given in foreign countries. Furthermore, the result of this Conference had been virtually to secure the adherencé of the Allies to the policy already announced by the British Government.

It was agreed --

(a) That an announcement should be made by the Prime Minister on the same afternoon in the following senses:-

"At the meetings which took place at 10, Downing street, of representatives of France, Italy, the United States of America, Japan and Great Britain on Thursday, Friday and Saturday of last


week, important discussions took place on the conclusion of Peace with Turkey and Hungary, as to arrangements for future sittings of the Peace Conference, and as to the ratification of the Treaties already concluded, and the execution of their clauses. The economic and financial situation was examined in detail. In order to remedy the fall in the Exchange prejudicial to the two nations, the British Government agreed, the date, the amount and the conditions of which will be fixed by agreement between the two Governments. The Russian situation was also taken fully into consideration, and on this, as on all other questions, the Allies were in complete agreement. The decisions taken on this question were in complete accordance with the policy already announced to the House of Commons. It was decided to resume the Allied Conference at an early date which would be convenient for the attendance of the Prime Ministers and Foreign Secretaries of France, Italy and Great Britain, and the representatives of the difficulties arising out of the situation in the Adriatic".

(b) That the decision of the Conference that no useful purpose would be served, by attempting to summon any general Conference of the representatives of the anti-Bolshevist States at the present time should not be announced except at the Prime Minister&apos;s discretion in a supplementary answer: (Appendix I, Resolution A.3.)

(c) That it was unnecessary to announce the decision that the system of Export Licences for the exportation of coal should be provisionally prolonged by a few days in order to allow time to study the question further: (Appendix I. Resolution E.)



THE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL AGREEMENT.



(5) The Cabinet took note of a statement by Mr Chamberlain that a separate Economic and Financial Agreement, not yet circulated and which was the basis of an announcement agreed to in Appendix 1, Resolution E, had been signed by M. Loucheur, subject to the reference of one clause to M. Klotz, the French Minister of Finance, and by himself, subject to that clause being accepted. The clause related

 



 




 To the time of repayment of a sum of £50,000,000 in gold which, during the War, had been sent to this country from France in connection with American Credits.



M. CLEMENCEAU.



(6) A suggestion was made that the Prime Minister, on behalf of the Ministers who had recently conferred with M. Clemenceau in London, should send a telegram of sympathy in regard to the injury to him reported in the morning&apos;s newspapers. From enquiries made at the French Embassy, however, it appeared that no official information had yet been received on the subject.

In these circumstances the Prime Minister decided to await confirmation of the newspaper report before taking action.



TAXATION.



Cabinet Committee on.



(7) The Chancellor of the Exchequer reported that it was becoming evident that the Government might have to impose additional taxation next year, and that in any case changes would be necessary in the forms of taxation. Some alternative for the Excess Profits Tax might be required, and the results of the Committee on Income Tax might also render changes necessary. In view of the very difficult and novel problems involved, he would be glad to have the assistance of some of his colleagues with whom he could confer on these questions. Owing to the great pressure on the time of most of its members, he did not feel justified in asking the Prime Minister&apos;s Finance Committee of the Cabinet to undertake this additional burden.

AT SUPPLIES.       (1) With references to Cabinet 11 (19), Conclusion 3,  theConference continued the consideration of the Meat Situation,with special reference to the effect which the decontrol of imported meat might have on its price and on the price oft,home-produced meat, and on the Government&apos;s undertaking to the farmers.It was explained that the Ministry of Pood, by removin.all registration of customers, could automatically removeall restrictions on consumption.    Further, some administra-tive charges would be saved by withdrawing the Ministry ofFood from the position of intermediary between the Boardof Trade and the Associated Importers.    Emphasis was laid on the importance of the Board of Trade maintaining for the imported meat a price which,  on the average, would not involve any loss to the Government.      There would be reasonable complaint if the Government were found to bedumping imported meat below cost price.    It was recognisedthat this policy might be found difficult, owing to thelong period during which some of the meat had been in store,and the Government might be forced to incur some lossultimately in getting rid of inferior qualities.    On theother hand, the policy now proposed did not involve therepudiation of the bargain which had been entered intowith the farmers, who would continue to receive thoscheduled prices.    Further,  the freeing of imported meatmight very well lead to the national consumption of meatreaching the pre-war level, from which it had fallen duringthe war.   The apprehension of a probable stringency ofsupply next year might, it was suggested, prove to be un-founded so far as it was based on the anticipation of sub-stantial purchases of meat by the Central European countries.The Conference agreed to recommend the Cabinet  (a) To decontrol imported meat:(b) To instruct the Board of Trade to dispose of the stocks of imported meat at a pricewhioh,  on the average, would avoid financial loss to the Government:
(c) To continue the control of home-producodrent,  in the Interest of the famors:(d) To withdraw the machinery for tho gjregistration of customers * f,* 1(e) To terminate the present system by whichthe Ministry of Pood acts as intermediary between the Board of Trade end the wholesalers.The Conference authorised - -The President of tho Board of Agricultureand Fisheries and the Food Controller tointimate the above conclusions to theConference of Farmers to be held that afternoon, and to offer the farmers the option of continuing or abolishing thecontrol of home-produced moat, the detailsof the announcement to the farmers to beagreed, before the Conference met, by theDepartments concerned (the Treasury, theBoard of Trade,  the Ministry of Food, theBoard of Agriculture and Fisheries, andthe Scottish Office).(2)    The Conference had before them a Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trado (Paper C.P.,-251)  In whichIhe proposed that, as the Mercantile Marine was during thejPar a fighting force in a. very real sense of the   ord, theiBerbers of it who had been giv^n the British empire order should bo placed in the Military Division of the Order,instead of in the Civil Division.The Conference decidedThat the awards of the British Empire Orderto the Mercantile Marine should not telimited by the scale applied in the navy and Army, but should- be considered ontheir own merits.f3)      The Conference had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (Paper CP.-123) on the questionof erecting memorials to the British Army on the variousbattlefields.    The Conference was asked to consider thequestion from the point of view of principle, as to whether public money should be spent on the erection of war memorialson the principal battlefields where the British Army had &quot;fought during the late war.It was sugwosted that one monument was sufficient ineach theatre of war, including Mesoootamia;.that this might.
take the form of an obelisP similar to the Cenotaph in whitehall, which might thus become a national emblem; thatan obelisk, similar to those erected by the Canadian Govern-^ ment, might be erected on the various battlefields;  and that persons of eminence, outside the Government service, should &apos;bo   included on any Committee set up to consider the question,The Conference agreed -(a) To recommend in principle that public money should bo spent on the erection of war memo-rials on some of the principal battlefieldsof the British forces:(b) That a Committee should be set up to adviseas to the form of the memorials:(c) That the Secretary of State for War should arrange with the Prime Minister as to theTerms of Reference and constitution of theCommittee.j.FUTURE OF (4)    With reference to War Cabinet 500, Minute 9 (a), theMix IS TRY OFgTIONS. .   Conference had under consideration a Note by the Secretary__ (Paper CP.-224)  covering a Conclusion of the FinancegSTRY&quot; OF Committee of the Cabinet recommending that the House ofCommons should be   invited to appoint a Select Committeeto consider the best form of permanent organisation forthe provision of supplies required by Government Departments;together with the following Papers, on the proposa.1 to set upa Ministry of Supply:-A Memorandum by the First Lord,  covering aMemorandum from the Admiralty (Paper G.T.-7193),A Memorandum by the Secretary of State forIndia  (Paper G.T.7250),A Memorandum by the Minister of Munitions,covering draft Bill (Paper G.T.-7007),A Memorandum by the Minister of Munitions(Paper GPC-7007 A.)Committee of Home Affairs 28, Mimrte 3:Note by the Acting Secretary (Paper G.T.-72S4)It was pointed out that as so many members of thepresent Government had at one time or another been incharge of the Ministry of Munitions,Ministers had themselves a far more extensive knowledge of the subject under considerstlori than could possibly be acquired by any Committee theHouse
 of Commons might appoint. It was certain, moreover, that such a Committee would discover serious differences of opinion among Ministers.

On the broad merits of the question whether there should be a separate Ministry of Supply, opinions which had been held during the War had, in some cases, been changed, owing to the fact that during the next five years the Army and the Royal Air Force would be living on their surplus stores, and the number of purchases to be made would be too small to justify a separate purchasing organisation, particularly in view of the fact that any separate organisation would involve considerable duplication of staffs. The Fighting Departments, on the one hand, would require staffs to focus their demands, while the Ministry of Supply would also require staffs to examine and carry out the requisition made. Moreover, under the present system the Fighting Departments were faced with the great difficulty of not being able to know exactly what figures to put in their Estimates, owing to the fact that the estimates of cost made by the Ministry of Munitions were continually changing. It was essential, moreover, for the Air Ministry to control the technical departments for the production of aircraft. It was impossible to separate design from supply, and design must be in the hands of the Air experts. Were it a case for bulk production on a large scale, design might be separated from supply; but during the next few years there would be no bulk production. If the Navy, Army and Royal Air Force were to obtain their supplies through a separate Department, it would put them in a very difficult position and make it impossible for them to accept responsibility for their Estimates, besides involving an immense Departmental correspondence and great friction at every step in the proceedings.

It was also suggested that there would be the greatest difficulty in inducing the House of Commons to pass the proposed Bill involving the retention of the immense organisation of the Ministry of Munitions.

  


0n the other hand,  it was pointed out that the experienceAf the War had shown that the great Departments of the *State, were continuously o-cmpe ting with one another for labourand materials, with the result that contractors were able toplay off one Department against another,  and a general  enhance-ment of prices was inevitable.    It had also been found thatthe Department?? were in the practice of making euch heavy demands that in seme cases they continued buying a commodityalthough there were altogether ten years&apos;   stocks at the dis-pssal of the Government.    In the result, many millions    ofmoney had been wasted,  and this would continue unless therewere a central buying agency.    Moreover,  it was impossible,under the present system,  for the Chancellor cf the exchequer to-determine at the end of any year the assets in the handssf the Government.Further,  it waa suggested that the Contract departments of the Admiralty and war office were not sufficiently acquain-ted with tra.de conditions to know how economy oouid be 3e-cured by slight alterations in the patterns of articles,  whichwould be matters  of common knowledge to any trade expert,particularly,   for example,  in articles of every-day use,  suohas cutlery and demestic utensils-.It was pointed out that it was obvious that wherecertain stores were common to several Departments the amount required for stock,  if there were a central pool,  would beless than if  each Department had its cwn- reserves.Cn the other hand,   it was held that if a Ministry ifSupply were established and other Departments simultaneouslymaintained their supply staffs,  the last state would be worse than the first,  and it was therefore suggested that theproposal for a Ministry of Supply should only be countenancedsn- the assumption that Departments would cease their ownsupply organisations,
The opinion was expressed that the perscrawl of theService Departments were not sufficiently trained or suffi-cinotly expert in technical matters to ercoarul under war condi-tions, and that for that reason the supply arrangements of theHavy arid Army had been bad.    The Oesign,  the supervision ofmanufacture, and testing, had all bevn under the control ofamateurs.    At the  same time, if technical matters were to be handed over to the Ministry of Munitions, the result would be tohill kf.Qnness in the Services.    It was suggested, therefore,that the remedy was not to set up a large and cumbersome Ministry,but to overhaul and staff properly the technical, designing and producing Departments of the Admiralty and the Par Office, andto insist upon technical matters being controlled by experts.The ttm should be to organise the officials of the service departments on such a basis as to make it possible to expandthem into a Ministry of Supply on a large scale should anothergreat war break out.    Had that been done In the past,  six months would have been saved in the late war.It was generally agreed that for the purchase cfordinary trade articles,  such as boots, clothing and consumablestore a, there would be a great advantage in a system of centralbuying, but that for that purnose a Department of a much leesambitious character than that contemplated would be sufficient.Emphasis was laid on the. fact that, while there mightbe a   system of common production for small arms, ammunition,rifles and machine guns, the requirements of the various services for the higher classes of ordnance were so different in character, owing to the necessity for extreme accuracy in naval ordnance, that it would be a fatal error to attempt totakeaway control in such matters from the Departments respect-ively concerned.    It was also pointed out thai  the late Boardof Admiralty had exhaustively examined the problem, and were ofopinion that they could not be responsible for the efficiency
of the Fleet if the higher forms of equipment were removed fromtheir control,, and that the new Board of Admiralty appointed afew months ago were of the same opinion.    The view was expressed that, inasmuch as this view was -generally known outside the Services^it would be extremely difficult to carry a Bill through the Houseof Commons on the lines proposed.Reference was made to the effect in time of war of thedemands made on the man-power of the country owing to competition between the Supply Departments of the various Services.    It was urged that, in the case cf a future war, the control of the raanu-facturing processes of the country must be centralised, in order toavoid the overlapping demands for the e: eaption of men, otherwiseavailable for the Admy, made by the Admiralty, the Air Ministry andthe Ministry of Munitions.It was suggested, after further discussion, that theFighting Departments should prepare a list of the articles whichthey were ready to take from a common Supply Department and thata Committee should be appointed to consider whether the Office cfWorks, the Stationery Office and the nucleus of a new buying organ!-sation might not be combined into one Supply Department.The Conference agreed(a) To reject the proposal to refer the matter toa select Committee of the House of Commons:(b) That the Fighting Departments should draw up lists of stock commodities and standardisedarticles which might with advantage be thesubject of common purchase and manufacture,anci should forward&quot; the same to the Ministerof Munitions, who undertook to make further proposals after consultation with the first commissioner of Works%  ^a^tha^^^nolSb^siaanda^fl^3^^^^^^tB^^0n )^t^^fMouid. be respenoiblefor atlae^K^dj^^S^^^^^^^^^^ifM^o^oifeY/onks^n^ailtf.;.p:,thbr supply -Services, BuxkStorage ,of Stocks, ^and.,,Factories&apos;j etc:&apos;&apos;i&quot;5,sSi*
