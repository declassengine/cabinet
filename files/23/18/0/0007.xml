pi), (1) Owing to a report by the Chief Secretary of the veryiin grave menace of assassination to which the Dublin Metropoll- ppolitantee. tan Police is exposed at the present time, the Cabinet agreeThat the Chief Secretary should request the Lord lieutenant to coxae immediately to London, with a view to a conference with the Prime Minister and some of hiscolleagues on the afternoon of Friday,November 14th.       The Chief secretary should further- arrange for the attend-ane&amp; of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief*   General Byrne, the Head ofthe Royal Irish Constabulary?   and colonel Johnstons, the Head of the dublin Metropolitan Police, and should invite them to brino definite proposals.DASIS   - (:&amp;) The Chief Secretary reported to the&apos; Cabinet thatEducation Bill into Parliament.That, subject to agreement between theChancellor of the Exchequer&apos; and the chief secretary as to the finance of the IrishEducation Bill, it should be introduced in Parliament in the following week.f&amp;RTs Am (3) With reference to War Cabinet 634, Minute 1, thoISTSMpATIoU)     Cabinet had before then? the following documents a   Memorandum by the President of the Boaarat oVv&amp;As (Paoa r CP.-80 K containing the4*draft of the Imports and Exports tHfitgu-lation) Bill by a Cabinet Committee,i together with a re-draft of the bill approved by the Committee,andA Memorandum by the Food Controller (Paper .% I. &quot;      (4) The Cabinet took-note that the Trade Regulation Com-it itution mittee to be set up under Part I of the Bill, consisting ofgrade Bogu-lon Cos-     the Parliamentary Representatives and Permanent Officialskey .of the Board of Trade and the Department of Overseas Trade,together *with ten Members of the House of Commons nominated by the house, introduces a new constitutional development.
atof the proposal,I ih (3) The Cabinet at first felt aome hesitation aboutMpat ion      applying the provisions for the prevention of dumping tojumping.goods from the British Dominions as wall as from foreigncountries.   They felt, however, that &apos;as the basis of these provisions is that dumping is an illicit and wrongfulpractice, it would not be justifiable to permit it in thecase of the Dominions.   Further, it transpired in the courseof the discussion-that Canada,&quot; the only Dominion from whichdumping in the United Kingdom is to be.apprehended at thebavin?; regard to the above considerations^ the that tho am. 1-^dumping provisions of Part IXshould apply to all parts of the world out-side the United, Kingdom.(.1x1. (6) The Committee had left to the decision of the Cabinet-**Ohdus-      the question as to whether in Clause 9 (1) (b) the sowersm,for prohibiting the ia^crt&amp;tipn of the goods specified inPart II of the Second Schedule, namely, thorium nitrataand gas mantles and- gas mantle rings, should be exeroisablewithin a period of two or throe years front the terminationof the present War.The Cabinet decided  That the period given in the Bill should boI three years, but that if pressure werer exercised in Parliardent the Governmentshould be prepared to concede one year,leaving the period a total of two ysare\*I (7) The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the factthat under Clause 10 the Board of Trade could refuse toI grant a license for the importation of goods specified inthe Second Schedule to the Bill, even though the applicant
was prepaysd to pay the prescribed fee.The Cabinet felt that there would be strong Farlia-Brantaw onnosition to this proposal, owing to the increasingfear of anything in the nfeture of a Trust, and owing to the objection which is felt in Parliament against giving   1-unfettered powers to any Government Department.The Cabinet agreed  That the Bill should be amended so as toprovide for an appeal by the applicantto the Trade Regulation Cobalttee againstthe decision of the Board of Trade.(8) The Cabinet had under consideration the proposal ofthe Food Controller (Paper CP.-96) that all foodstuffsshould be otaitted froa Clause 16 (1), and that the followingsub-clause should be added:-&quot;The Pcarrt may by Order prohibit the export-ation to any country or glace specified inthe Order of any articles of food or drinkor any materials used in the production.,Manufacture or preparation of any sucharticle&quot;.In support of this proposal it was urged that thefood situation is not sufficiently settled to warrant aremoval of existinR restrictions, and that it is essentialthat power&apos;should be reserved in the Bill to regulate theexport of foodstuffs.   Unlimited export would not onlydiminish supplies but also raise prices to the level of the effective Continental dejsjand..   A considerable nutsber ofimportant foodstuffs ware not included in Clause 13 (1)*For example, the Clause as now drafted, gave no power to prohibit the exportation of livestock (which, it was explain-ed, could not he included under the heading of &quot;Meat&quot;), Owingto the vacuum on the Continent&apos;in regard to livestockgenerally, and milch cows in particular, there was a serious risk that this country might be denuded of cattle. Similarly,power Is taken to prohibit the exportation of wheat, but not
of flour;   and of edible fats, but not of the raw tasterialsout of which they are emoluments.de.   -There is no power to prohibit the exportation of butter and cheese, oleaginous seeds,nuts, kernels and the products thereof.   Against this,however, it was urged, that production would be discouraged by the drastic additional sub-clause proposed by the PoodController, and there sight be a tendency to set upfactories in foreign countries and thereby to attract sup-plies there instead of to this country if this proposal wasadopted.    Further, it was pointed out that until the termina-tion of the far the -prevention of a loss of supplies throughexcessive exportation is provided for by the powers for theallocation of foodstuffs.Clause 16 was further criticised on the ground thatsub-clause (I) provided for the exportation to any country or place specified in the Order, and. sub-clause (3) conferredthe power on the Board of Trade to make art exception bylicense.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That if, when the ratification of the lastTreaties of 3?eaoe was approaching.it w?*.s found that our food supplies wereendangered by the possibility of excessiveexportation owing to the lapse of the powersobtained, during the War for allocating&apos;food-stuffs, the Pood Controller and the Presidentof the Board of Agriculture and fisheries should lay fresh proposals before the Govern-,went for such special action as might be -considered desirable.(b) That the following, words should be emittedfrom the second line of Clause 181-* To any country or place specified in the Order&apos;&quot;,so that the first lines cf this clause willread as follows&quot;The Board may by Order prohibit the exportationof any of the following articles, that is to say*-*Cold and silver. (9) At the request of the Chancellor of the Bxehequer -The President of the Board of Trade undertook to make such amendment to the Bill as would
secure to the Treasury the - right, without reference to the Trade Regulation Committee,to license the export of gold and silver.Second Schedule * (10)   Theof*.t rs xi% took note that It ens      in Part Xsend Schedule to the Bill, which in***** - *F,leotrle Carbons, and Carboni*, should read &quot;Are Laxao CarbonsThe Cabinet approved thai Item IS on the list3 io^l gg^g .fIp 11? * aThe Cabin?;Magnetos sjiiLthatFerro-ohroise and fe r ro-iuolybderoua should notbe added to the list in Part I of the second schedule, as desired by the Federation ofBritish Industries, but that if parliament should express a general desire for their inclusion this should, be conceded.-roaedvusegardsJcnmitt.(11) While recognising that a considerable amount of titsejje, would he required, and difficulty encountered, in thepassage of the hill through a Goauaittee upstairs in theHouse of Commons, the Cabinet -were of opinion that it wouldbe very difficult to find the time necessary to pass the 3111through a Committee of the House., and that on the whole &quot;itwould be advisable to refer the Bill to a Committee upstairs.Approval of the (im) Subject to the above amendments, the CabinetIntroduction approved the early introduction of the bill of the Bill, -      in ararliaxaent*POST-TAR POLICY   (IS) With reference to tar Cabinet 572, Minute I, of HayFOP P!&quot;&apos;PPP3IVfABISAUgNT CP     2-8, 1919, the Cabinet had. under consideration a MemorandumMvlPCHAhTVESSELS, by the President of the Board of Trade and. the Chipping Con-troller on the subject of the Defensive Armament of MerchantVessels (Bsper CP.-39).The Cabinet took note of the. fact that theAdmiralty, the Shipping Controller and theBoard of Trade consider that the provisionof stiffening in merchant vessels generallyshould not now be made obligatory,and decided  That no further action need be taken in theimatter.
