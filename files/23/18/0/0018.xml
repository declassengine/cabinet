I primeUlster&apos;satement.Ii (J0VFI!WMRNT (1) With reference to Cabinet 16 (10), Conclusions 4 toIRELANDili. 9* ihe Cabinet oont.irrued&quot;thear-- dieffussion on Tariwus-points^nsfer ofPostfice.connected with the statement to be made by the Prime minister in the House of Commons on the same afternoon.The Cabinet were informed that no member of the IrishNationalist Party would be present in the House during thediscussion.(2) With reference to Cabinet 16  (10),  Conclusion 9, thefirst point  on which the Prime minister wished to have theopinion of his colleagues was as to the line he was to takeabout handing over the Post Office to Ireland.It was pointed out that neither a Staxe in the AmericanUnion nor a State in the Dominion of Canada had the controlof the Post Office.    It was suggested that, from *he point ofvie - of the safety of the country in time of war,  it wasdangerous for the Post Office to be in other than Imperialhands.    The safeguards to be provided in the Pill for obtain-iru? security in time of war would not in practice prove ade-quate,  since it would be difficult to operate the  system witha personnel appointed by, and relying for i.ts promition on,a different  regime.    On the other hand,  it was pointed outthat at the present time the staff of the Post Office inIreland was known to include many Sinn Feiners, and that the inland Telegraphs in Iceland had not the same standard ofseoreey as in G^eat Britain.In view of the fact that provision was made in theHome Rile Act of 1914 for handing over the Post Office toIreland,  it was felt that the ne&quot; proposals would be greatlyweakened by its omission.It was agreed  That the Prime Minister should state thatthe Government was agreed in principle to hand over the Post Office to the Irish .Ad-ministration, but that it would be extremelydifficult to work it under two separateAdministrations.    Consequently, the Govern-ment would only be prepared to hand it overprovided that the Northern and Southern Par-liaments could agree on a joint scheme forits administration.
he higher (3) The next point on which the Prime-Mini at * * wished toudioiary. .....obtain the views oh his colleagues was as to appoint:- ents tothe Higher Judiciary in Ireland.    Should this be handedover to the Irish.Administration,   or retained under imperial parliament?It was recalled that,  under the provisions  of theHome Rule Act,  the Higher Judiciary was to be appointed bythe Lord Lieutenant,   on the advice of the Irish Government.This scheme, however, would not be workable with two Parlia-ments.    ?or example,  it would not be cound in practice with-a^e two sena-a+e Courts of Appeal, one for the T-Torth andone for the South.It was agreed that this cues tier, turned largely onthe position hitherto.    If, up to the present time, the lord lieutenant  had made appointments on the  advice of the IrishGovernment, it was felt it would not be right to reservethese appointments in the fihme, provided that the diffi-culty of the two Parliaments could be surmounted.    If,  onthe other hand,  the Lord Lieutenant had acted on the advice of the Imperial Govern ent, there appeared no reason to0hang 3 the p rose dure .After this question had been adjourned for a shortM^e to enable enquiry to he made, the Lord Chancellor andthe Attorney-Gene&quot;al info-med *heir colleagues that, underthe Act  of Union,  the Higher Judiciary was not one of the reserved services,  and that  the Lord Lieutenant had to acton the advice of the Irish Government in this matter.It was ag-eed  That the Prime Uiniste- should state that,if arrangements could he made by the Councilof Ireland for an agreement between theNorthern and Southern Parliaments,  the appointments of the Higher Judiciary wouldbe transferred.-S-
tion.    (4) The next point on which the Prime Minister desireda decision was Transportation.It was agreed  That he should announce that Transportationwould be handed over to the Irish Parliaments,and that,  as some of the commurii cat ions pass through both the Northern and the Southernareas, the two Irish Legislatures could byagreement  give the control of Transportationto the Council of Ireland.(5) With reference to Cabinet 16 (19), Conclusions 8 and,  the Prime Minister, who had not been present at the dis-cuesion of the questions of Customs and Excise on the previous occasion,  asked for some further consideration of them.After some discussion,  the Cabinet agreed  That the Prime Minister in his speechshould state  &apos;(1) That when Ireland is united it is open to the Imperial Parliament to review the situation and considerwhether it is desirable to giveCustoms to the united Irish Parlia-ment.    Meanwhile, the Cabinet areof opinion that with a dividedIreland it would be quite imp^ac-ticable to set up a Customs barrierbetween North and South.(2)  That until union is achieved between north and South,  it would be undesir-able, and probably impracticable, togive power with regard to excise to either of the two Legislatures.Customs andigxcise,Pote by the &quot;pc&quot;4 ary.This was not precisely the conclusionas agreed to at the Cabinet Meeting, butas the result of the discussion at theCabinet the prime Minister, in the inter-val between the Meeting  \nd his statement,made certain modifications to meet the representations of the Chancellor of theExchequer,  and the above is what the PrimeMinister actually announced.
Disposal of (6) Tha-Prljne Mi^ advise himAnnuitiesunder the as to what should he the nature of his statement, in regarding-&apos;.sh LandPar-chase Act. to the allocation of the annuities under the Irish LandPurchase Act.In the cniir-se of the discussion it  transpired thatthe position of these annuities, which wore derived fromthe sale to tenants of land purchased by them from theG-overnmeirt under the above Act, was approximately asfollows :-Amount Cf annuities derivedfrom transactions amountingto so-;e  50,100,000 alreadycompleted  ....................... about  3,000,003.Amount  of annuities to be derived fro-&apos;&quot; transactions, * amounting to  17,500,000,which are completed but onwhich payment has not yetcammenoed.......................  about  1, COO, 300.Amounts to be derived fromannuities on transactionsamoun txng t o  30,000,000still remaining to be com-ple+ed.......................... about  1,500,00 0.TOTAL from  5,000,000 to  6,000, 000The question arose as to whether the whole or onlya portion of this total of  5,000,000 or  6,000,00    shouldbe handed over to the Irish Parliaments.It was pointed out that the following additions tolocal expenditure in Ireland had recently been or were about to be incurred:-Old Ago Pensions  .............i*.     1,SCO,030Health and UnemploymentInsurance  ...... 1.,.....say  300,000.Housing,  from  100;000 rising to  l,0op,000 per annum average,  say, 500,000.Education .......................     500,000.very approximate Total  ...   S.500.QQQThe cost of these services,  it was pointed out, nearlybalance-:.&apos;, the amount to be derived from the annuities fromco. pleted transactions.
The attained natives appeals r e d to be to hand over to theIrish. G-overnment the above services, together with the revenues to be derived from the uncompleted transactions,or else to  retain in the hands of Imperial Parliament boththe  services themselves and the same revenues.In favour of the former suggestion the Cabinet were reminded that the Irish people had always complained of thecost of applying to  Ireland,  where conditions of life are different,  schemes which were based on the stands Ms ofGreat Britain,  and that if these cervices,  together with the revenues referred to, were handed over,   the Irish Parliamentswould have  an opportunity to demonstrate their power of more economical administration.    On the other hand,  it was suggest-ed that  it would be very difficult for the new Irish Parlia-raent8 to stant by cutting down benefits that had been givenby Imperial Parliament and -vere already in operation.The general view was in favour of handing over to theIrish Parliament the  4,000,000 of annuities derived fromcompleted transactions under the Land Purchase Act, but thequestion was remitted to the Minister of Pensions to workout in conjunction with the Treasury officials and to referhis proposals to the Chancellor of the Exchequer beforesending them to the Prime Minister.(At this starve the Prime Minister with-drew and Mr Bonar Law took the Chair.)EMPLOYMENT (7) With reference to Cabinet 16 (19),  Conclusion 1, theBSURAPCEILL, Cabinet had before them a Note by the Minister of Labourand a revised draft of the Unemployment Insurance Bill  (Pacer0.1.-335).The Cabinet were informed that the Chancellor of theExchequer had now concurred in the financial provisions cfthe revised Bill,  and it was agreed  To reverse hie previous decision,  and thatthe Minister of Labour should be authorisedto introduce the Sill in Parliament.
BRITISHDEALINGSIN FOREIGNP! MTUMBONDS.(8) With, reference to Cabinet 10 (10)* Appendix II (4),the attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the following    FQuestion on the Parliamentary Paper for December 2.SJ,  1919:-&quot;      To ask Mr Chancellor of the Exchequerwhether he is aware that  the Press ispublishing the terms upon which P-enchPremium Bonds may be acquired;    andwhether,  in view of the emphatic, eondem-nation of pre:aium bonds given in this house, the Government propose taking any action to discourage or prevent  dealingsin the premium bonds issued by othercount ries.&quot;The Attorney-General expressed a provisional opinionthat dealings in foreign premium bonds would be  &quot;a sale oradvertisement of dealings in a lottery&quot;,  and consequentlyillegal,  but he promised to give a considered opinion within an hour.Subject to confi^niatior. of his provisional opinion by the Attorney-General,  it van agreed  That the Chancellor of the Exchequer should reply to the Question in the nense that hewas advised that dealings in foreign premiumbonds were illegal.THE.
