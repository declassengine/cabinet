OLD AGE PENSIONS

(1) The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer covering a Memorandum on the proposals of the Old Age Pensions Committee prepared by Mr Millar, of the Treasury, who was Secretary to the Committee (paper G.-264). Mr Millar was present during a portion of the meeting to answer questions put to him by the Cabinet.

It was pointed out that the most moderate of the proposals of the Departmental Committee, which had formed the subject of Mr Millar&apos;s Memorandum, involved an increased expenditure of £14,356,000 over present expenditure. Other proposals where now before the Cabinet for increased expenditure in connection with Health Insurance and Unemployment Insurance, both of which would cost large sums. Finally, the finance of the Irish Policy of the Government would also involve from £3,000,000 to £5,000,000 a year additional expenditure. These large sums could only be raised by means of additional taxation, and would probably involve an increase in the Income Tax. Public opinion, it was suggested, would not stand this. The present state of the foreign exchanges was very bad, and this could not be improved until it was possible to fund the floating debt. This, however, could not be achieved until we ceased to borrow on revenue account. Even the borrowing for Housing Policy would be very difficult. All this made additional taxation undesirable to the last degree. It was suggested that the proper course was for the Government to tell Parliament that they could not take the responsibility of recommending the adoption of the Committee&apos;s proposals.

It was generally accepted, however, that if the question were left to the judgment of the House of Commons, as in the case of the cessation of Out-of-Work Donation, the House would probably accept the proposals of the Committee.


The pressure from the constituencies would be so strong that only the greatest insistence on the part of the Government could induce the House to reject these proposals. Moreover, whereas on merits the case against the renewal of the Out-of-Work Donation had been strong, the case against the Committee&apos;s Old Age Pensions proposals on merits was weak. It was pointed out that when the increased cost of living was recognised by an all-round rise in wages, when many manufacturers were making huge profits, and when the national revenue was being collected on the basis of the present lower value of money, it would be very ungenerous to refuse to make a proportionate increase in the Pensions of the most needy part of the population.

The Cabinet were reminded, however, that when Old Age Pensions were introduced it had never been expected that they would suffice as the sole means of subsistance of individuals. It had rather been hoped that the Pension might enable two persons, by combining resources, to eke out their existance, and that by means of the Pension old people would be welcome guests in the families of their relations. With the exception of the Dominions and Germany, no other country had Old Age Pensions at all. If the Pension was raised from its present war rate of 7s.6d. to 10/-, which would be double the pre-war pension, it would probably never be practionable to lower it. It was not anticipated, however, that the cost of living would always remain at double the pre-war rates, and very likely 7s-6d. Would be a reasonable increase on the original 5/- when rates of living reached the normal.

Various suggestions were made towards a less costly scheme than that proposed by the Committee. It was suggested, for example, that some temporary increase, might be




given; or that the increase should apply only to persons in receipt of the full Old Age Pension. It was pointed out that a considerable part of the money would be paid to Ireland, where the cost of living had not risen to anything like the same extent as in Great Britain, and it was suggested that this might be taken into account in connection with the finance of the Government&apos;s Irish Policy.

Without approving the proposals of the Departmental Committee, the Cabinet agreed:

(a) That some increase in Old Age Pensions was necessary:

(b) That a Cabinet Committee, composed of:

The Chancellor of the Exchequer,

The Minister of Health,

The Minister of Pensions,

Should examine the question with a view to finding some equitable scheme which would be less costly than the proposals of the Departmental Committee:

(c) That the Lord Privy Seal should reply to questions in the House of Commons on this subject in the sense that the Government found the proposals of the committee would involve extra taxation and were examining further into the question.

(2) With reference to War Cabinet 577, Minute 5, the attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the present position of the Select Committee of the House of Commons on the subject of Land Values Duties.

It was reported that the Chairman of the Committee, Mr Beck, M.P., had written a letter to the Prime Minister in which he had pointed out that the Committee had reached an impasse. Mr Raffan and the Labour Members on the Committee had wished to place before the committee new proposals in regard to land taxation. The former Chairman of the Committee, the late Sir Thomas Whittaker, had decided that this was outside the Committee&apos;s Terms of Reference. The officials


of the House of Commons had been appealed to and had given the same opinion as the Chairman. Mr Raffan and the Labour Members had then stated that they would withdraw from the Committee unless they were allowed to raise these proposals. Captain Pretyman and certain other members of the Committee had then stated that if the proposals were made they would retire from the Committee.

The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the latitude allowed by the Terms of Reference, which invited the Committee to make recommendations in regard to the retention, alteration or repeal of the Land Values Duties. It was suggested that, by a judicious interpretation of the term "alteration", considerable scope would be given to the Committee.

The Cabinet agreed:

That the Lord Privy Seal should see Mr Beck, and endeavour to arrange with him some method by which the Committee could continue its work.

MEAT SUPPLIES.

(6) With reference to Conclusion 2 of a Conference held on November 28, 1919, the Cabinet had before them the Report of a Conference on the Meat Situation (Paper C.P.-232), which contained the following recommendations:-

(i) That all control of meat should be abolished at an early date.                                It was thought by the Ministry of Food that it would be impossible to remove the control before December 31st, but the President of the Board of Trade was anxious that an earlier date should be decided upon, if possible. 

(ii) That a scheme of compensation acceptable to the farmers should be arranged with them.

(iii) That all export restrictions on livestock (excluding milch cows) and meat (including canned and preserved meat) should be removed excepting the restrictions on bacon, with regard to which the Ministry of Food was unable to give an immediate opinion, but which they undertook to have examined.


- In addition, tho cabinet had be lore them a, Memorandumby the Food Controller (Paper CP.-254).!fhs Cabinet, wore agreed unanimously in the principleor de-ccntrcl.Phs discussion centred , therefore * upon the oroposalor the Committee for n scheme of compensation tc the farmersIt was pointed out that After Harsh 31st. this couldnot be carried cut without the authority of the House ofGofitfuons , where it would be very difficult to carry it..Compensation would make the farminp interest unpopular inthe House.   Yet * if meat control was xaaintalned , it waspointed out that its object would be to keep prices high for.the benefit of the fanner 9 in contradiction to the originalobject in establishing a Food Ministry, which was. to keepprices down tor the benefit of the consumer-   It was statedthat in aortal times there v-ex^ two parallel markets, for meatThe higher grades were sold to those who could pay for them5and the lower gradest which Included imported ate at, to the poorer classes.    It was explainsa that en announcementposted up in all the principal markets by the Ministry of food in regard to the prices oi cattles had been interpretedby farmers in all parts of the United Kingdom as tantamount to a guarantee by the Government to purchase their fat stock,of the first * second and third grades.    Nevertheless $ itwas stated that at the time of its issue the Ministry ofFood had anticipated that there would be a market for everyhead of cattle in the first three grades that the farmerseould bring tc market, and it was asserted that the faxatershad ground for their belief.    If the control was removed and the prices fell, the- farmers would loss all faith in
Government guarantees..   The actual sffeet of removing controlsit was alleged, would be that the prices of the highest grades of cattle would rise, while these of the lower grades would -fall.It was stated that the farmers were only bringing to market 75 per: cent, of the cattle that had been brought inbefore the War, and it was suggested that if an undertakingwas given to place on the market only 7S per cent, of the imported neat placed on the market before the War, the farmers lii^ht be willing to forego control without compen-satioru   This, however, could only be effected by continuing the control of imported meat, and it.was stated that admin-is t rat ively this wes oxtrejseiy difficult.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That, as the President of the board ofAgriculture and Fisheries ban to meetthe Farmers1 Advisory Council on Tuesdayafternoon, the subject should fee taken up at a Conference on the following-morning:(b) That, in the meantime * the Food Controllershould consider the possibility cf retaining the control of home-produeed meat, whileremoving for the present the control of imported meat.Whitehall dam ens * ; *&apos;-.!,ygcmo&amp;r &amp;, 1&quot;*^*
