THE BLOCKADE OF RUSSIA.



(1) With reference to Cabinet 8 (19), Conclusion 1, the attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the following Question to be addressed to the Prime Minister in Parliament, by Colonel Malone, on November 27th:-



"To ask the Prime Minister whether a ship making for Narva or any other ice-free port in Soviet Russia, with cargo consigned to Russian Soviet subjects or authorities, would be allowed to pass freely or would be stopped or interfered with by H.M. Ships in the Baltic".

It was suggested that very shortly the approaches to Narva would be blocked by ice. The view was expressed, and not controverted, that while anything in the nature of warlike stores ought to be stopped, there would be advantages in allowing a ship laden with foodstuffs to pass.

The First Lord of the Admiralty undertook to make enquiries and to advise the Prime Minister as to the reply.



RUSSIA.

The Copenhagen Negotiations in regard to Exchange of Prisoners.



(2) The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to rumours that, in the forthcoming negotiations at Copenhagen with a view to an exchange of prisoners with the Russian Soviets, Mr O&apos;Grady and M. Litvinoff would not confine themselves strictly to the avowed object of their meeting, and were expected to enter into political conversations. The Cabinet were informed that the instructions to Mr O&apos;Grady were perfectly explicit. On the previous afternoon the French Ambassador had called at the Foreign Office to enquire as to these rumours, but when the instructions were read to him he had expressed himself as satisfied. The only possible basis for the suggestion was that conceivably M. Litvinoff might endeavour to secure, as a condition of the exchange of prisoners, some concession as regard the raising of the blockade. Mr O&apos;Grady had been instructed that in such an event he was at once to communicate with the Foreign Office and to take no action except on instructions from London.






RUSSIAN POLICY.



(3)  With reference to Cabinet 8 (19), Appendix III, the suggestion was made that the material was now ready for a resumption of the discussion on Russia, either by the Cabinet itself or by the Conference which had previously dealt with the question. It was pointed out in this connection that the Secretary of State for War and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had both forwarded Memoranda, as requested by the Cabinet. The attention of the Cabinet was invited more particularly to a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the subject of the Baltic States,  which contained important information as to the origin of General Yudenitch&apos;s operations.

    The attention of the Cabinet was also drawn to the section taken by Colonel Rowlandson in the Caucasus, and the desire was expressed for further information on this matter.

   With a view to an early resumption of the discussion on British policy in Russia, the Cabinet invited -

(i) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to circulate Memoranda in regard to Siberia and the Trang-Caucasian States, conceived on the same lines the Memorandum in regard to the Baltic States:

(ii) The Secretary of State for War to circulate information in regard to Colonel Rowlandson&apos;s action in the Caucasus.



THE PRINCE OF WALES&apos; RETURN.

(4) With reference to Cabinet 1 (19), Conclusion 2, the Cabinet agreed --



That His Majesty the King should be advised of the desire of all Cabinet Ministers to be present to most the Prince of Wales on the Platform of Victoria Station on His Royal Highness&apos;s arrival.



The First Lord of the Admiralty undertook to communicate the time and day of arrival to the Secretary, who was instructed to notify all members of the Cabinet.



IRELAND.



(5) With reference to Cabinet 5 (19), Conclusion 2, the Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of Irish Policy:-








The Second Report of the Cabinet Committeeon Ireland (Paper 0*P,-137),The Third Report cf the Cabinet Cojamitteeon Ireland (Paper C.P.-190),A Report on Financial Clause8 (Paper C.P.-139),A Memorandum by the lord President of theCouncil (Paper C.P.-193).After a full disouseion, the Cabinet, without adoptingany final decision on the alternative policies proposed by theCabinet Committee and the Lord President of the Councilrespectively, agreed -of the Second Resort of thettee (Paper 0.1.-127), inunanimously decided that theof a Pill&quot;would be preferableuction of resolutions:(b) That the Cabinet Committee should proceedto wrov&apos;&amp; out the Bill or Bills necessaryto give effect to the policy proposed inits Third Report (Paper G.P.-i9Q):(c) That it should be loft to the discretion ofthe Committee to advise whether, with a viewtc expediting the introduction in Parliamentof the main principles of the measures pro-posed, it would be desirable to includeeverything in a single Bill, or to includethe large controversial political Issuesin one Bill and the less contentious ques-tions of detail, wfcbh required- much closestudy, in a second Bill:(d) That the Cabinet Goxmuittee should be askedto submit alternative drafts on any matterson which the Committee felt that the decision should rest with the Cabinet:    these matters should include the question of the retentionor otherwise by the&apos;Imperial Government ofthe power of levying Income Tax in Ireland:(a) That all members of the Cabinet should care-fully consider a proposal, ssadS in the courseof the discussion, that after the passageof the Second Reading of the Bill it should&quot;be remitted to a Joint Committee of bothHouses, following the- precedent set in thecase of the Government of India Bill.The Cabinet desired to place on record their high appreciation of the laboursof the Cabinet committee, and theirthanks to its Chairman, &amp;r Walter Long.(a)tat ion
Criminal Law and Procedure.



(6) With reference to Cabinet 8 (19), Appendix IV, the Cabinet had before them the draft of a Bill to amend the criminal Law and Procedure and alter the Jurisdiction of Justices in Ireland (Paper C.P.-194).

    The Bill was criticised, firstly, on the ground of its length; and, secondly, that its introduction in Parliament would arouse such passions as to jeopardise the passage of a Government of Ireland Bill. In this connection it was pointed out that the Bill would be strongly opposed in Parliament by those who favoured the grant of Home Rule to Ireland, and that, in order to overcome their opposition, it would be necessary to speak very plainly about the present condition of Ireland and the attempt of the Sinn Feiners to terrorise it by means of murder and assassination. This would arouse such indignation that the passage of any measure for the Government of Ireland, on the lines now under consideration, would be rendered very difficult.

   In reply, it was pointed out that after consulting precedents the draughtsman had found that the Bill could not be shortened. The view was generally assented to that it was impossible to allow cowardly murderers to go unpunished, and that the Executive must be given the necessary powers for securing convictions where ample evidence was available.

The Cabinet agreed -

 

(a) That the Chief Secretary for Ireland should be asked to shorten the draft of the Bill to amend the Criminal Law and Procedure and alter the Jurisdiction of Justices in Ireland:

(b) That the Chief Secretary for Ireland should be authorised to introduce the amended Bill in Parliament as soon as Parliamentary time could be found to enable it to be pushed forward rapidly:

(c) That in his first speech on the Bill the Chief Secretary should refer to the intention of the Government to introduce legislation in regard to the Government of Ireland at an early date. The nature of this statement should


depend on the progress of the Government of Ireland Bill and the future decisions of the Cabinet on the subject.



THE ROYAL DOCKYARDS.

   

Discharge of Workers.

(7) With reference to the Draft Conclusions of Mr Bonar Law&apos;s Conference held on November 25th, Conclusion 4, the Cabinet were informed that the Admiralty had now carried out the ballot at the Dockyard Ports on the subject of the proposal that the men should work short time in order to avoid discharges, the Admiralty antedating a certain amount of repair work in order to increase employment.   At Chatham alone had the Admiralty scheme been accepted. At the other Dockyard Ports there had been a slight majority in favour of the scheme, but an undertaking had been given that the scheme would not be adopted unless 60 per cent, of the workers voted. This had not been the case, and in consequence the Admiralty scheme could not be put into effect. It was difficult to put the scheme into execution at Chatham only, as this would involve different treatment from the other Dockyards.

It was generally agreed that the final decision was bound up with a somewhat similar question which had arisen at Woolwich, in regard to which the Prime Minister had promised to visit Woolwich this week, as well as with the smaller question of the discharge of civilian subordinates of the Royal Air Force.   The final decision should, therefore, be postponed until after the Prime Minister&apos;s visit to Woolwich. It was also generally agreed that the Admiralty should not take any course involving surrender to the men&apos;s claims to be retained in full work.

Having regard, however, to the facts that a certain amount of repair and other work could be antedated from the original programme, and that no houses were available in other parts of the country where work for the discharged men 


could be found, the Cabinet agreed --That, as an interim processes&amp;sure, the admiralty should proceed, only slowly with the dischargesand. should antedate repair work as far as neces-sary to carry out this procedure,COHFttE^NCB (8)     The Cabinet took note of the ConclusionsOF MXHI3TF.ES. of a Conference of Ministers, held on80v.es.ber 18* 1919 (An*?appendix).S, Whitehall Gardens, S.^,1,Hqvesib er SMS., 1919 *

ELECTRICITYBILL.PROPOSEDPERMANENTTO DEAL WITHNATIONALSTRIKES,(g)    The attention of the Conference was called to aORGANISATION   Memorandum by the Chairman of the Supply and transport committee on the subject of a suggested permanent organisation for meeting strikes  (Paper 0.P-.-97),The Minister of Trsscspcrt said that he desired the guidance of the Cabinet as to whether a nucleus organisation should be kept in being,  together with certain equipment and records of uolunteers,  for- future emergencies.It was agreed that no final decision could be taken on any question involving expenditure without a preliminary examination of the measures proposed, and particularly inthe abscrrtio of the Chancellor of tho Exchequer0It was pointed out that there was an essential difference between a.Hallway or a Miners&apos; Strike, whichthreatened to paralyse the life of the nation, and an ordinary industrial and sectional strike, as,  for example,in the cotton trade.    There was no Intention of interfering with the latter, but only of coming to the rescue cf thecommunity when confronted with the disasters which would arise under the former..It was generally., agreed that some .nucleusshould be kept in being,  and the Supplyand Transport Committee was authorised tocontinue its investigations into thecharacter and extent of a nucleus organ-isatlon which it was thought desirable to preserve, but approval&apos;.  of any each organ-isatlon was withheld until the conference had a ccnoreto scheme before it.The(1)    It was agreed that a Conference of the following ministers should be held on Wednesday, November 19th,  1919*at 12 Keen, to consider certain questiens- which had.arisen in. connection with the Electricity Bill:-The Prime minister the Lord Privy SealTho Heme Scoret aryThe President of the Board of trade the Minister of transport the Attorney General,together withThe Government Whips.
Tho Committee was requested to consider:-(a) How far it was feasible in this countryto  follow the example of the UnitedStates of America and proceed byinjunction;(b) Whether legislation should be proceeded with which would authorise the&quot;Governmentin a national emergency to proceed by proclamation or Order in Council when astrike threatened the life of the community,,The aspects of CP.  97 involvingexpenditure were reserved until theChancellor of the Exchequer could bep resent.(&apos;3)    With reference to War Cabinet 635, Minute 8,  theConference had before them the- following documents:-A Note by the Secretary of the Cabinet,covering a resolution of the Supply andTransport Committee (Paper C.P.-78J:A Memorandum by the Secretary of State forWar,  on the Employment of *Troops in IndustrialDisturbances  (paper CcPo-lll).The Conference approved the proposals for encouraging the formation of Special Constablesinstead of Citizen Guards, on the linos setforth by the Home Secretary and approved bythe Supply and Transport Committee,Subject to the qualification that the WarOffice should be responsible for the care, of all arms, explosives,  and lethal weapons; generally,  the Conference also approved the\ following measures which the Chief of the\ Imperial General Staff recommended should betaken (Paper CP^lIl):-(a) That existing military guards on all warlike stores and factories under the control ofthe Ministry of Munitions and other Guvern-ment Departments be withdrawn and relieved by civil wa&quot;cchmon or similar personnel,(b) That,, in case of industrial trouble,  allprotection duties and assistance to thecivil power be found by the police,  as-sisted where necessary by such organisa-tions as Special Constables or Citizen Guards.(c) That,  in case of the Army being required as a last.      resource, when the situation maybe getting beyond the control of the civil power, the Ministry of Transport bo pre-parod to provide the mechanical and othertransport necessary for the movement of thotroop Sc.    An estimate of what would berequired in such a contingency is being-prepared by the War Office.With
With reference to recommendation (c)  theSecretary of State for far undertook tocommunicate with the Ministry of munitions and other Departments concerned with ,regard to the control of arms and explosives, t(4) With reference to War Cabinet 630, Minute 3,  theConference had before thorn a telegram which had been received torn Er. Barnes on the question of the number of hours inthe working day and working week, and a reply thereto whichnad been drafted by the Minister of Labour,  suggesting thatthere was no objection to an 8-hours day if six days a weekwere worked;    &quot;but if, zn order to secure a short Saturday,more hours than 6vwero worked on the other days, the extrahours ahould not count as overtime.    It was also suggestedthat the British Government should accept in principle thelimitation of overtime to not more than 300 hours per annum for tho next five years.    This was intended to meet condi-tions on the Continent and in the United States,  and,  in theview of the Minister of Labour, would not seriously handicapthis country,  particularly as Shipping and Agriculture were excluded from the Convention.The Conference felt considerable hesitation in approving the proposed limitation of overtime, as thiscountry might suffer therefrom in certain critical industries_____^___^__-3-_______inBAB-    The Conclusions in their Braf? JorVAreccrdod thefollowing decision of tho Conference:-&quot; -&quot;(c)  That the Army be relieved by the General post Officeof all responsibility for the maintenance of tele-graphs,  telephones and other means of communication.It will be impossible for the War Office to carry out this important duty in any future emergency, owingto the roduct ion of trained personnel in the technicalunits concerned,  and to their being composed of alarge proportion of recruits.&quot;This Draft decision, was challenged by the Minister ofTransport, whose view that this recommendation of the Cf .G,S-had. not been accepted by the Conference mot with support inother quarters.    This part of tho Draft decision, therefore,has been eliminated as well as the following words in thonote below (a)  &quot;The Postmaster General with regard toresponsibility for telegraphs and telephones, and&quot;.    TheMinister of Transport proposes to bring the question of thotransference of responsibility for telegraphs,  etc., from theWar Office to the General Pest Office before an early meetingof the Supply and Transport Committee of the Cabinet whichtho Secretary of State for War and the Postmaster-general will be invited to attend..
in a time of emergency, and cases were quotec where at thepresent time, in order to aid production, overtime at therate of 500 hours per annum wa? being worked by agreementwith the Trade Unions concerned.The Conference referred the matter for decision to a Committee composed of:-Tho Minister of Labour.The President of the Board of Trade.The Minister of Transport.The Homo Secretary.to be convened by the Ministry of Labour:tho question to bo brought again to theCabinet only in the oaso of disagreement.In the meantime, Sir David Shackletonundertook to consult leading employerson the proposal.(5)    The Conference had under consideration telegram no, 411 from Sir Horace Rumbold at Warsaw, reporting thatthe French Minister at Warsaw,, with his concurrence;intended to enter a..dayeat regarding direct discussions between the polos and Germans&apos;- of details of the evacuation by the&apos;Germans of territories to be ceded by them to Poland.The Conference considered that it wa3 undesirable that, the negotiations between the Poles&apos;and Germans shouldbo Interrupted if they were Inclined to &quot;be on friendlyterms with one another, particularly as the Peace Conferenceat Paris had s*Lre&amp;dy too much to-do.- It was pointed out that in the event of any arrangc-me&amp;fc being como to which was, contrary to the Peace Treaty,i &quot;would bo ipso facto null and void.The Conference agreed:-That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffaics should instruct Sir ,3yre Crowethat, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;a- Government, there was ho objection tolocal discussions such as those now taking plaee between the Germans andthe Poles, provided that any agreementarrived at were-   :.a   referred to-thePeace Conference for approval.
PJTURE tfF THE (6) The Conference had under consideration the followingf supreme economic documents:-COUBC^^A Hots by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,covering a Memorandum by Sir John Bradbury(Paper C.PallO and Copo-ll0&amp;)8 proposing that the Supreme Economic Council shouldbe brought to an end:A Memorandum by Mr.  wise,  the British Repre-sentative cn the Permanent Committee nfthe Supreme Economic Council (Paper C.P.-135);A Note by the Secretary of the Cabinet (paper c.P.-40J covering a Memorandum by Mr. Wise,suggesting the formation cf a Cabinet Corn-mi ttee on Economic Questions arising sut ofthe discussions cf the Supreme economic council.The Conference felt great difficulty in discussing the questi&amp;n in the absence of the Chancellor of the Exoheq-uer through indisposition,      The matter, however, v/as repre-sented as one yf great urgency,,    A meeting of the supreme economic Council was to take place in Rcme in three days1time, and it was known that the French Government would thenraise a number of resolutions as to the form of international co--operation in economic matters both now and after theleague of Nations had started.    The French had not formulatedtheir proposals with precisicn^ but the Conference were givents understand that the suggestions made at the end of Mr.Wis^-S Memorandum (Paper cp-135) were in accordance withtheir views.    They desired to keep some kind of machinery inexistence until the League of Nations were able to assumecontrol,.    The Supreme Economic Council was a purely inter-allied body, and under the League of nations it would benecessary to provide representation for various neutral StatesMr. WiseTs proposal was that the permanent officials of theSupreme Economic Council should work out a scheme in con-junction with the Secretariat of the League of Nations,  theSupreme Economic Council continuing in the meanwhile,    It was essential  that the British delegates, who were leaving london on the following morning,  should receive instructions as tathe attitude they were to adopt on these questions,,.
Very strong views were expressed in favour of the suppression of the Supreme Economic Council,     While it was      Krecognised that the Council was of advantage to Continentalnations, it was pointed out that experience had proved thatit was of little advantage,  and frequently a matter of em-barasessment,  to the British Government.      The American andBritish Governments were the only ones that had anything togive, and they had constantly been exposed to pressure fr^mContinental Governments to give more.      Sometimes, as, forexample, at the recent Brussels Conference,  the criticismdirected against the British Government had been positivelyoffensive.    The representatives of the American Governmenthad actually ceased to attend the r,*/VtS.ngs of the Council,although there had been no formal notice cf withdrawal.     TheBritish representatives were placed in an awkward positionowing to the difficulty of reconciling the divergent functions between, en the one hand, doing all that was possible tiassist British trade,  and.,  on the other hand, placing Britishresources,  through the Supreme Economic Council,  at thedisposal of our Allies.   An illustration of this was givenin the case of coal.    The coal trade was a most important item in our balance of trade, and high prices could be obtainedfrom Neutrals.    France and Italy had, by arrangement, beengiven the benefit of lower rates, but the French objectedeven to&apos;pay this reduced price, although they themselves wereselling coal to Italy at far higher prices.   Moreover, they refused to limit the price to the consumer,  as was done inthis country.    The result of the high prices we had been gettingfor export coal was that British industry had been subsidised tothe amount of 3s,4d. per ton,On the other hand, it was pointed out that, even if theSupreme Economic Council itself was abolished, some ef the subordinate executive bodies would have to be retained.This applied more particularly to the great purchasing organ-isations that had been formed all aver the world for the

The result of the high prices we had been gettingfor export coal was that British industry had been subsidised tothe amount of 3s,4d. per ton.On the other hand, it was pointed out that, even if theSupreme Economic Council itself was abolished, some of the subordinate executive bodies would have to be retained.This applied more particularly to the great purchasing organ-isations that had been formed all aver the world for the
*purpose of buying meat, wheat,  sugar and other commodities,,and which were of great assistance in preventing the rise *of prices by international competition.      It was difficult,however,   ts isolate these bodies,  since the purchase of feedwas inseparably connected with its transportation..      Sir john bradbury&quot;s proposal, which involved dividing up the functionsof these subordinate executive bodies, was criticised enthe ground, that it would not be practicable to place purchase in the hands of one body and shipment and distribution inthe hands cf another.      It was pointed rat that lord robert cecil,  and other persons who were interested in the Leagueof Nations, would be very disturbed if any step were taken,without consulting them,  to abolish the Supreme economic council before the League cf Nations had taken over Its work.It was suggested that if the Supremo Economic Council disappointment -appeared there would be no-one to survey the economic needs ofthe starving parts of Europe,  and it was stated that the reparations Commission would have neither the experience northe staff to do this.    It was represented that the moment was peculiarly unfavourable for separating the British...-Government from the Supreme Economic Council,  since thiswould be interpreted as an Indication of British policy inthe event of the United States dropping out of the League.In this latter connection, however;,  the Conference felt thatit might not be altogether a disadvantage to let it be knownto some of the Continental nations that they could not take our attitude fear granted in the matter of assistance.On a review of the above considerations, the Conferencedecided(a) That the Minister of Pood, as the principalBritish Representative at the forthcoming meeting-of the Supreme Economic Council, ,without announcing the withdrawal of theBritish Government from the Council,  shouldbe careful not to commit us to its prolongation-tion.    He should stage that he had discussed the matter with his colleagues, and had founds
that a very strong feeling existedagainst the continuance of the Council,and he should Indicate that the attitudeof the British Government would probablybe largely influenced by that of theUnited States of America.(b)That ia the meantime no object would be gained by discussing the future machineryfor dealing with economic questions either(11) for the Interim period or(ii) when the League of Nations is formed.(?) She Conference had-under consideration a Paper bythe Secretary      State for Foreign Affairs regarding theeo&amp;tiBuanoe&apos;by Great Britain of a guarantee of the independ-ence and integrity of Belgium (Paper CP.-117).The Secretary of State:for Foraign Affairs atated that negotiations had been proceeding. for some time between theBelgian and-&apos;Dutch Governments&apos;for the conclusiea^ef a Treatyof ReTiaioa:v&apos;ef the Treaties of -1839,. which declared perpetualthe&apos;Neutrality&apos;*f Belgium and guaranteed that neutrality against attack.   Ho thought that those negotiations were now likely to result in an Agreeaeat, although no Agreement had bees; reached. so.far&apos; because Holland was reluctant to enter into an engagementfor giving military protection to Belgium while Belgium was not satisfied unless she&apos; received substantial guarantees.     he believed that the acceptance of the proposals, put forward in his memorandum of November 10th.  (Paper CP,-11s?) would esaiegj, theconclusion of an Agreement between Holland and Belgium*     Twokiads of guarantee had been suggested-     The first was larger in/scops, aad involved the conclusion by the French and british governments of a Treaty with the Belgian Government guaranteeingBelgium against unprovoked attack by Germany^   . This proposal had recently been put forward by Barop Monohaur, hut no encouragementhadf3
had been given to him.    Be rod Moncheur had merely been informedthat His Majesty&apos;s Government would be reluctant to enter -inoemore into engagements similar to those of 1939.      Since thennothing more had been heard of the proposal..     A second pro-gosal, of narrower scope, had now been made by the French Ambas-ambassador.    It was that the United kingdom should enter into an engagement with prance to guarantee the territorial integrity of Belgium pending the provision of suitable guarantees by theLeague of Nations.    The French Government were of opinion thatit would be advisable to give this temporary guarantee as itwould encourage the Butch and Belgian Governments to. come to terms.    The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was disposed,to think that it would be well to give this guarantee pendingthe establishment of the League of Nations, provided that theperiod were limited to 3 or 5 years.      The French were willing togive the guarantee without limit of time.     While the Belgianswere anxious to.dissolve the arrangements of 1839, they were very nnxious about what would happen in the interval before theestablishment of the League of Nations.The Conference considered that, before deciding on anyguarantee to Belgium,  it would be desirable to ascertain what the position was in regard to the Treaty guaranteeing the integrity of Prance, which had been made dependent on the co-operation of the. United States,      It,now seemed quite probablethat the United * States would not enter into such en engagement,,in which case our guarantee of the territorial integrity of france might have to be re-considered.The Conference inclined to the view that we might give aguarantee of Belgian neutrality with a 5-years&apos; time limit ifthe United States would join with us in guaranteeing the Integrity
of French, territory,      If the United States would not co-operate with us in this,  the whole question of our relationswith France and Belgium would have to he re-considered.      some doubt was felt as to whether, if we entered into a guarantee of belgian neutrality for 5 years, we should be able to obtainrelease from it at the end of that period.The Conference decided -Thet the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should instruct Lord Grey by telegram to ascer-t&amp;in the probable at bit.ido of the&quot;united Statestowards the proposed Treaty guaranteeing theterritorial integrity of France,  and that thematter should be brought up again on receiptof Lord Grey&apos;s reply.&quot;a      *      &amp;Wlii t :hall Gardens,  S.W.I.November 18th. 1919.
