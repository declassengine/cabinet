RSiS S0N&quot; CD The Prlne Ulniater save the Cabinet a resume of his  *personal conversations with li.  Clemeneeau, as veil as ofmore formal Conferences which,  in company with some of hiscolleagues,, he had had first with IC, Clemenceau and otherFrench represent- tives,  and,  later,  with representatives ofItaly and of the United States of America,In addition to the question of Russia (see Minutesa and, 5 below) the questions of the Adriatic,  Turkey andReparation were briefly touched on.H^IA. (?.) mhe Prime Minister read to the Cabinet a first draft which had been prepared under his instructions,   setting forth the Conclusions which he thought had been reached in regard to Allied Policy iri Russia,  and which would formthe basis of proposals which he was.contemplating submitting to the Conference on the following day (Appendix).The Secretary of State for war asked that- it might beplaced on record that he was not in agreement with thepolicy as set forth in this draft, which involved theabandonment  of the anti-Bolshevist. forces in Russia whichwe had supported up till now.    In the course of a longstatement on this subject he mentioned that he had. paidhis resoee+s *o       Clemenceau that morning,  and in a con-versation he had Understood that M.Clemenceau -as in agreepment with himself on the following pointsf-(I) That there should be mediation between poland and General denikin, with a view to the estab-lishment of a common Trent from the Baltic tothe Caspian:(ii) That France and England ought to co-operate in putting pressure on ,esthonia not to enforce the disbandment of General Yudenitch&apos;s forces.He hoped that these points would be taken into considera-tion before any agreement was finally concluded,  and that-1-
the following points would not be overlooked:-(iii) That the anti-Bolshevist forces should beallowed, to purchase warlike stores at their disposal value:(iv)  That the Russian v?ar material captured byGermany and now actually available inGermany would, under the Treaty of Peace,be handed over to the anti-Bolshevist forcesin Russia.This would be permissible under the Treaty of Feaoe if theAllied and Associated Powers were regarded as the trusteesfor Russia.    He strongly urged also that the whole policy should be kept secret, as its publication would have a mostdemoralising effect on the anti-Bolshevist forces,  besidesconstituting a very serious breach of faith with AdmiralKoltchak.(nnounoewent (3) The general view of the Cabinet in regard to anyf Russianollcv. announcement of Russian Policy was that the less said the better,  and that it would be sufficient to announce that no new decision had been taken,  and nothing had been agreed towhich changed the policy already announced by the BritishGovernment, and that the Conference had been in completea ocord.The Prime Minister undertook to raise this question with the Allies on thefollowing day.&quot;Whitehall Gardens,  f-V*.l,December 13, 1919.
