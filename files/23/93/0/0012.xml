CENTRAL EUROPE.OC^oho-Slovakia.(previous reference;Cabinet 24 (38)Conclusion 6.)The Cabinet met as a matter or urgencyto consider a grave situation which had arisen in central Europe involving the threat of an aggression by Germany against Czecho-Slovakia which might involve Prance under her Treaty obligations to thelatter country    and   have    repercussions on a scale which no-one could predict.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs read to the Cabinet a summary of recent developments in the Czecho-Slovak situationcovering (a) military and political developments inCzecho-Slovakia, and (b) action taken by HisMajesty&apos;s Government and by the French Government:a copy of this is attached in Appendix I.     he brought this statement up to date by supplementaryinformation.     Following a talk with the PrimeMinister that afternoon, he had thought it rightto send a telegram to the French Government of asteadying character making clear that His Majesty,sGovernment had not in any action they had takengone beyond the statement in the Prime Minister&apos;sspeech in Parliament on the 24th March.     A copyof the telegram is attached in Appendix II.The Foreign Secretary also gave an account of   a   conversation he had had with theGerman Ambassador, at the end of which he had repeated the warnings he had already sent to theGerman Government through His ManestyTs ambassador in Berlin as to the dangers of precipitate   actionwhich might result in a general conflagration.(Appendix III.)     He also reported a conversation he had had v/ith the French Ambassador, whQ had
0990 Ij hiindicated that the French Government were quite steadythough sensible of the importance of avoiding the dilemma between   a    failure to observe the obligations of their Treaty with Czecho-Slovakia and the risk of wareThe Ambassador had pointed out that the French w.;reconscious of the ultimate risk to the whole of Europe,including France and the United Kingdom, if Czecho-Slovakia was overwhelmed,.     The Foreign Secretary pointedout that the margin between a policy based on that dangerand one of preventive war, which MQ Daladier hadrepudiated in London, was rather narrow-,     The ambassador had assured him that r:.;a3ioe was not thinking in terms ofpreventive war.The Prime Minister then read Berlin telegramNo, 207 of the 22nd May in two parts, in which HisMajesty-s Ambassador had noted that war in Germany,however propagandised, would be extremely unpopulargenerally:    that his two Military Attaches   were motoringto-day towards the Czecho-Slovakian frontier to see for themselves:    that the State Secretary of the german foreign Office was genuinely pleased that they should doso:    that he was convinced that Herr Hitler desired a peaceful solution:   but that the German Press attitude had become rather fatalistic, i0e0 &quot;If they are obligedto, they must at whatever cost, march into Czecho-Slovakiato save fellow-Germans from ill-treatment and massacre&quot;.(Appendix IV ).The Cabinet discussed the matter at some lengthand the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs answereda number of questions.     He mentioned that he had drafteda somewhat anodyne statement to be made in Parliament on
the following day and he hoped that no other information would he given.The Cabinet took note that there would be no formal communique to the Press as to the result of theCabinet Meeting but that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs would see representatives of the Press:   that he proposed to intimate that the situation was slightlyeasier;    that, in view of a tendency in the German press to assume that the realities of the situation are notunderstood here, he would emphasise that we are exertingpressure in favour of peace not only in Berlin but alsoin Prague:    that he would urge the Press that the first and most important issue is not the placing of the blameon one side or the other, and suggest that they should concentrate on the desirability of getting back to asettlement which he believed to be quite feasible, if thepresent excitement could be quietened down.On the whole, the Cabinet felt that it wouldbe better that the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should not see the Czecho-Slovak Minister the same evening, as the German Press might draw the deductionthere from that he was giving special consideration to the czecho-Slovak side of the case.While reports that control was passing from theGovernment into the hands of the General Staff at Praguewere considered disquieting, since this might tend towards an extension of the preliminary measures of mobilisationalready adopted in Czecho-Slovakia, the Cabinet felt itwas inadvisable for His Majesty&apos;s Government to takedirect action at Prague in the matter.     To do so when we were under no obligation to come to Czecho-Slovakia&apos;ss.aid in the event of German aggression might well put us in
^2 4;a false position.     The French Government, on the otherhand, owing to the existence of their definite Treaty werein a position to make such representations,     A statement ofthe Foreign Secretary that he had already mentioned thematter to the French Ambassador that afternoon was noted.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.22nd May, 1938.
APPENDIX      I.Summary of recent developments inCzechoslovak situation.(a) Military and political developments in Czechoslovakia.On the evening of May 19th reports were receivedfrom H.M. Consular officers at Munich and Dresden tothe effect that German troops were concentrating inSo Silesia and N.Austria, and that leave had been suspended for Sunday,  May 22nd,  the day of the firstcommunal elections in Czechoslovakia.    On May 20thH.M. Minister at Prague reported that he had beeninformed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that theyhad received reports of German troop concentrationsin Saxony and certain troop movements on a smaller scale in Bavaria.    Reports had also reached Praguethat Hungarian troops were moving to the frontierat Estergon,  and according to earlier reports there hadbeen polish troop movements on the Polish-CzechoslovakfrontieroOn May 20th H.M- Ambassador in Berlin called theattention of the ?t-ate Secretary at the Ministry ofForeign Affairs to these rumours, and was assured thatthey were nonsense.    This assurance was confirmed byGeneral Keitel, Chief of Staff of the German Army,who added that so far as Saxony was concerned, in only one place were there more troops than usual owingto the normal annual exercises.    Similar reassuringmessages were conveyed to the Czechoslovak Governmentin Berlin and in Prague, although the German denialwas not so categorical in respect of the Bavarian andSilesian frontiers as in respect of Saxony.-1-
H.M. Minister at Prague reported that early on the21st May the Czechoslovak General Staff believed themovement of German troops in the direction of the Czecho-slovak frontier to be general, and had received reportsof the advance of two particular Infantry divisions andcertain Air formations towards the Bavarian-Czechoslovakfrontier.    On the morning of May 21st an official messagereached Mr. Newton from the Czechoslovak General Staff thatin face of continual provocation since May 1st they werecalling up one class.    The German Military Attache hadprotested at 9 a.m0  against what he described asmobilization orders.On May 21st the Minister for Foreign Affairs informedMr. Newton that the Czechoslovak Government were satisfiedthat the reports of German troop movements were substantiallyaccurate.    One class had therefore been called up to re-assure Czechoslovak public opinion and- ensure the maintenanceof the authority of the-State in the frontier areas.Dr.  Krofta added that Herr von Ribbentrop had made a veryunpleasant and threatening communication to the Czechoslovak .Minister in Berlin at 7 p.m.  on May 20th, complaining of incidents involving the ill-treatment of Sudeten Germans-Dr. Krofta   assured Mr. Newton that the Czechoslovak Governmentwere absolutely ooposed to war and adventure, and were most reluctant to take further military steps; but it might become necessary to call up further classes.    Dr. Kroftainformed Mr. Newton on this occasion of an unfortunateincident early on May 21st in which two Sudeten Germans onmotor bicycles had been shot dead near the frontieron refusing to obey an order to stop from a gendarme.
Dr. Krofta had informed the German Minister,  andpromised that disciplinary measures would he taken,and,  in reply to an enquiry from the German Ministerregarding Czechoslovak military measures,  he had assured him that the Czechoslovak Government were notsuch fools as to threaten Germany.    Dr. Krofta described the situation as very serious,  and said he was very uneasy.In addition to the shooting of the two Sudeten Germans already mentioned,  serious incidents took placethroughout Czechoslovakia on May 20th, particularly atPrague and Brun,  in which Sudeten meetings were broken up by Czechoslovak socialists and communists.On May 21st the State Secretary at the Ministryof Foreign Affairs in Berlin again assured Sir N. Hendersonthat stories of German troop movements were completelyunfounded.    Sir N. Henderson reported that the military attache in Berlin had not been able to discover anyauthentic information to confirm them.    He added,however,  that  the situation might have been changed asa result of Czech calling-up of reserves.    Accordingto the latest information available at the War Office inLondon, units of 11 German divisions have been traced moving towards the frontier in Bavaria and Saxony, and one class of reservists has been called up in Leipzig.    no information has reached the War Office regarding Germantroop movements in Silesia or Austria.On May 19th the President of the Council had announced to the press that the Czechoslovak Government had agreed upon the main principles of the Nationalities Statute,which would be the subject of legislative measures and of
negotiation with the interested parties.    Dr.  Hodza addedthat these negotiations with the German and other minoritieswere at hand.    Dr. Krofta informed Mr.  Newton on May 21stthat a formal invitation had been sent to herr Henlein byDr. Hodza through the Minister of the Interior,    In a speech at Tabor on May 21st,  the President of the Republicreferred more generally to the Government&apos;s plans for asolution of the minorities question,  and turning to recentincidents said that the Government    had rightly declaredthat such things could no longer be tolerated.On May 21st announcements appeared in the Sudetenpress that the Political Committee of the Sudeten GermanParty had held an extraordinary meeting on May 20th,  atwhich it was decided to inform the Prime Minister thatthe Sudeten Party were not in a position to discuss theNationalities Statute so long as peace and order in the sudeten districts,  and above all the constitutional rightsof freedom of opinion,  of the press and of assembly,  werenot guaranteed.    The Committee,  while appealing toParty members to keep calm,  could not control individualSudetens from resorting to self-defence in provocationcontinued.There has been some mystery about Herr Henlein&apos;smovements since his departure from England a week ago.    OnMay 20th it was announced in Prague that he had gone on holiday to the German Alps, but according to the Secretary ofthe German Legation, his whereabouts were unknown - even tohis Deputy, Herr Prank.    According to the Sunday papers,Herr Henlein arrived in Vienna with his&apos; wife on the evening of Saturday, May 21st, and left for Prague shortly aftermidnight.
On the morning of May 21st H.M. Ambassadorcalled on the German Minister for Foreign A-ffairs and found him in a very excitable and pugnacious frame of mind about the shooting of tv/o Sudeten farmers and the injury of many Sudeten in recent incidentsand the Czechoslovak action in calling up one classof reservists.    Herr von Ribbentrop indicated that german patience was almost at an end,  and she couldnot tolerate such a situation, and if provocationcontinued, her 75 millions would s t as one man,He had no confidence in Czechoslovak good intentions.He was not very helpful in response to Sir N.  Henderson&apos;splea that he should restrain the German press.In the afternoon of May 21st instructions were sent to Sir N.  Henderson to bring to Herr von Ribbentrop&apos;notice the regret with which His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthad learned of the decision of the Henlein Party notto open negotiations with the Czechoslovak Governmentin present circumstances.    Sir N-  Henderson was to urge the German Government to use their influence with Herr Henlein to promote an early opening of negotiations.    Sir N.  Henderson was also to draw theattention of the German Government to their responsibilities  in regard to troop movements inthe direction of Czechoslovakia,  in regard to whichrumours were still reaching His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin spite of the assurances given to Sir N.  Henderson.He was to remind the German Government of the efforts of His Majesty&apos;s Government at Prague to promote a peaceful solution of this question,  and of the factthat the firmest assurances had been received from
the Czechoslovak Government that they were determined to do their utmost.    In view of this, Sir N. Hendersonwas to beg the German Government to exercise patienceand all their influence in the-proper quarter.    He was finally to remind Herr von Ribbentrop of the dangersv/hich would arise out of any conflict, and in particular of French obligations to Czechoslovakia and of the factthat His Majesty&apos;s Government could not guarantee that circumstances would not also involve them.    In thisconnection he was to draw Herr von Ribbentrop&apos;s attentionto the relevant passages in the Prime Minister&apos;s speech in the House of Commons on March 24-th last.Sir N.  Henderson made representations accordingly to Herr von Ribbentrop on the evening of May 21st.    Thelatter maintained that all the provocation had come fromthe Czechoslovak side, and that our warning should beaddressed to Prague rather than to Berlin.    He declined to give advice of any kind to Herr Henlein,  and repeated that the German attitude depended on developments atPrague.    He was oerturbed by the references to the PrimeMinister&apos;s speech of March 24th, but declared that if the worst came to the worst Germany would fight again as she did in 1914.    The State Secretary, whom Sir N. Hendersonsaw before seeing Kerr von Ribbentrop, also took the line that the present trouble originated from the action ofCzechoslovak extremists, who wished to force an issue nowrather than later, and instanced in this connectionCzechoslovak military preparations.At 12.20 a.m0  on the 22nd May, a telegram was sentto Prague instructing H.M. Minister to represent to
the Czechoslovak Government the confidence of HisMajesty&apos;s Government that the Czechoslovak Governmentwould continue to take every precaution to prevent or minimise incidents.    His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere informing the German Government of their confidence and the Czechoslovak Government would realise thesupreme importance of making every effort to provetheir desire to keep the way open for a peaceful solution.Sir N. Henderson was at the same time instructedto inform the German Government of the advice being given in Prague and to impress upon them that HisMajesty&apos;s Government were going to the utmost limitsin endeavouring to keep the way open for peaceful solution.    He was also instructed to convey in allpossible earnestness a personal message to Herr von ribbentrop from the Secretary of State, expressing the earnest hope that he would make every effort t o securepatience at this critical time,  adding that it would beimpossible to foretell the results if resort were hadto force, and that he could not count upon this countrystanding aside if precipitate action led to Europeanconflagration, from which only those desiring thedestruction of European civilization could benefit.In any case, the prospects of understanding between our two countries would be gravely jeopardised by any german action which appeared wantonly to destroy the chances of peaceful solution.The Prench Minister for Foreign Affairs informedH.M- Ambassador on the evening of May 21st that he was going to warn the Czech Minister in Paris what serious
0 09consequences Czechoslovak mobilisation might have and how unfortunate was such hasty action without prior consulation with the French.    He proposed to tellM.  Osusky that there must not on any account be any furtherCzech mobilisation without consulting France and G-reat Britain.M*  Bonnet assured Sir E.  Phipps that the French Governmentwould bring all possible pressure to bear in Praguefor a peaceful solution,    M. Massigli later informed SirE.  Phiops that M.   Bonnet had spoken on these lines toM.  Csusky and that the French Minister in Prague had been instructed to hold similar language to the czechoslovak government.    The French Minister was to press the czechoslovak government in case of serious incidents or Germanprovocation to remind the German Government of the conciliationprocedure provided by Treaty.    M-  Bonnet had, however,remarked to Sir E.  Phipos that Czechoslovak action inmobilising might cause the Germans to maintain that the czechs had violated the terms of their   Arbitration treaty with Germany.    M.  Bonnet urged that the warning which H.M.Government had,  during the Anglo-French conversations inApril,  agreed to give at Berlin at the appropriate moment,should now be given and he was very satisfied to learn that Sir N. Henderson had already taken his action.    TheFrench Minister for Foreign Affairs has been informed of the terms of the communication made to Herr von Ribbentropon the evening of May 21st.Sir E. Phinps has the impression that M.  Bonnet is anxious to follow any lead His Majesty1s Government can give at Prague with a view to averting war.    M. Bonnet,however,  reaffirmed at a press conference on May 21stthat France would observe her Treaty obligations to czechoslovakia in the event of German aggression, and providethe utmost help to Czechoslovakia.    She was urging
the utmost prudence at Prague, but if Germanycrossed the Czechoslovak frontier, that would automatically start war.FOREIGN OFFICE.22nd May,  1938.
APPENDIX II.Cypher telegram to Sir E, Phipps (Paris).Foreign Office.      and May,  1938.      4.30 p.m.No.  141.IMMEDIATE.Your telegram No. 148 (of 21st May : Czechoslovakia).1. It is of utmost importance that French Governmentshould not he under any illusion as to attitude of HisMajesty&apos;s Government,  so fsr as it can he forecast at themoment,  in the event of failure to bring about peaceful settlement in Czechoslovak question.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government have given the mostserious warnings to Berlin,  and these should have prospects of success in deterring German Government from any extremecourses.      But it might be highly dangerous if the FrenchGovernment were to read more into those warnings than is justified by their terms.     /,3. His j.It-jesty&apos;s Government would of course alwayshonour their pledge to come to the assistance of Franceif she were the victim of unprovoked aggression by Germany.In that event they would be bound to employ all the forcesat their command.4. If, however, the French Government were to assume that His Majesty&apos;s Government would at once take jointmilitary action with them to preserve Czechoslovakiaagainst German aggression, it is only fair to warn themthat our statements do not warrant any such assumption.
oocreJ C D5. In the view of His Ms.iesty&apos;s Government themilitary situation is such that Prance and England, even with such assistance as might he expected from Russia,would not he in a position to prevent Germany over-running Czechoslovakia.      The only result would be a european war, the outcome of which, so far as can before seen at this moment, would be at least doubtful.6. His Kajesty&apos;s Government fully realise the nature and extent of French obligations but they feel that inthe present highly critical situation the French Governmentshould take full account of the preceding considerations.His Majesty&apos;s Government would therefore hope that theymight be given an opportunity of expressing their views before any action is taken by the French Government whichmight render the position more scute or have the resultof exposing them to German atte.ck.7. Please speak in above sense to French Minister forForeign Affairs, adding that of course nothing will be said in Berlin   to detract from the warning already given, andthat His Majesty&apos;s Government will continue to make everyeffort to restrain German Government and to secure peaceful settlement.      (Not repeated).
APPENDIX    III.Telegram to Sir N. Henderson, Berlin.May 22nd, 1938.II asked the German Ambassador to call this morningwhen I enquired whether he had any news.     His Excellencysaid that the reports that Germany was making military preparations were quite without foundation.     The news from the Czechoslovak frontier districts, however, wasdisquieting, hut the German Government intended to answerit only by silence, without taking any provocative measures.The Ambassador had received a report of your conversations with Herr von Ribbentrop, and added that Baron von Weiszaeckerhad also urged you to impress on His Majesty&apos;s Governmentthe necessity of speaking at Prague, whilst emphasising thatthere were no aggressive tendencies in Germany.     Accordingto the Ambassadors information from Prague, the government machinery there was not working at all smoothly.     Hisadvices were to the effect that the position of Dr. Hodzawas shaken and pov/er was passing into the hands of themilitary.     More than one class had been called up therewithout the Government being informed, and the regular andpara-military forces were gaining strength.     the czechoslovak Government, moreover, were spreading falsenews of German military preparations.     It was wholly untruethat the Germans had mobilised 8-10 divisions or, in fact,that they had called anybody to the colours.     There was no great moving of troops, such troop movements as there werebeing merely of a routine and seasonal nature, connectedwith annual exercises.     Herr von Dirksen said that theGerman Foreign Office wished him to urge that pressure shouldbe exercised in Prague where strong language was needed.1-
I told. His Excellency that we had alreadytelegraphed to Prague about the recent incidents and theneed for exercising the greatest forbearance.     I impressed upon His Excellency that precipitate German action,whatever the provocation, might compel the French totake counter-action, and I repeated to him the personal message which I had instructed you to convey to Herr von ribbentrop about our own position.     It was of the greatest importance to seek to lower the temperature and we, forour part, would continue to put pressure on Prague for the avoidance of incidents.     I was convinced that we could get a settlement if we were patient, but everyone musthelp and it must constantly be borne in mind that, if itever came to a conflagration, it would be Europeancivilisation as a whole which would suffer.     I assuredHis Excellency that, if there were any direction in whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government could help within the limit ofour powers, we should be very glad to do so and boggedhim to let me know if his Government had any suggestion of possible action on our part which we were not already taking.His Excellency replied that it would be a greatthing if Great Britain and Germany could work together for peace.      The danger lay in incidents.      If, for example,100 Germans were killed in some clash, it would beimpossible for Germany not to take action.     He added thatthe German Press was a good deal calmer today, following on an order from the Ministry of Propaganda to refrain from exaggeration.(Sgd.)      HALIFAX.
Decypher.     Sir IT. Henderson, (Berlin).22nd Hay, 1938.D. (Telephone) 22nd May, 1933.R. 1.30 p.m. 22nd May, 1933.Ho.  207.(PART I.)IM/IEDIATE.I had another long talk with State Secretarylast night.     While he seemed to be a little lessanxious he said his most disquieting news was thatCzech military party seemed to have the upper hand at Prague.I have been anxious about this ever since readingPrague telegram No. 143 paragraph (b) of which (andeven my French colleague entirely agrees) is completenonsense.     If there is a war party here it is notGerman military but party of extremists.Moreover war here, however propagandized, wouldbe extremely unpopular generally.Difficult though it is to be sure which of thetwo parties is lying in this case neither I nor mymilitary advisers have any tangible grounds fordisbelieving German denials of troop concentrationsat any rate before yesterday i.e. after Czechmilitary measures had already been taken.     This,subject to fresh information to the contrary initself lends colour to German view that rumourswere spread originally by Czechs to give justificationto their own preparations.     When I told Herr vonAPPENDIX   IV.
3 O JY/eiszacker last night that my two Military Attacheswere motoring to-day towards Czechoslovakian frontier to see for themselves he was without doubt genuinelypleased that they should judge for themselves.It would be a grievous mistake to assume thatGermany is always in every specific instance in the wrong.     While I have reported to you unequivocablyv/hat I believe to be Germany&apos;s ultimate aims asregards Sudeten, I am convinced that herr Hitler desires to-day the peaceful solution which in fact constitutes the first step towards exercise of self determination.I can quite understand that Czechoslovak Governmentrealizing that what we are asking them to doconstitutes in fact such a first stage, may prefer a crisis now rather than later.      But it is equallyclear that it is not in German interests to-day to provoke a conflict consequences of which areunforeseeable.Addressed to Foreign Office Ho.207 May 22nd;repeated to Prague, Par-is, Rome, Warsaw, Budapest.Ho.207.   (PART II.)Following is continuation of my telegram No,207.Every German paper this morning ha3 head lines to the effect that England refuses to see realities.That is in fact the German view whether it be expressed volubly and excitably by Herr von ribbentrop or calmly and reasonably by StateSecretary and others.     Prime Minister&apos;s statement
in the House of Conn-ions is given full prominencein the press to-day but it has already been largely discounted here and German attitude hasbecome fatalistic:    i,e.  if they are obliged to,they must at whatever cost, march into Czechoslovakiato save fellow-Germans from ill-treatment andmassacre.I am doing the utmost that I can here but if my representations are to carry weight I wouldearnestly beg that prominence be given in theBritish press to such strong advice as HisMajesty&apos;s Government may think fit to give atPrague.      Key to peaceful solution lies there and not at Berlin.I told the State Secretary last night that Iwould have recommended His Majesty&quot;s Government to urge Czechoslovak Government not to wait a momentlonger before taking contact with Henlein if ithad not been for party refusal to talk withCzechoslovak Government before guarantees weregiven.      I impressed upon him the necessity forsuch contact as /gr.undecV7 Qf curbing conduct/gr.undecJJ7 and deplored attitude of standoffishnessadopted by Herr von Ribbentrop.     State Secretaryhimself was objective and sympathetic but argued that it was acts and not words which were needed.He referred to M. Benes speech yesterday promisingcultural and other rights to Sudeten but pointedout that he had omitted the most important pointof all, namely, administrative autonomy.     I
ex-patiated at length on M. Benes&apos; difficulties.State Secretary while admitting them and unableto explain what M, Benes actually should do,could only repeat that he must do something.I fear that that is in fact the exactposition.(4)
