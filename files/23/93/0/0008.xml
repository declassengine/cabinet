ITALY. 1. The Secretary of State from Foreign A.ffairsAgreement said that all the information reaching the Foreign( with.Office confirmee&quot; that the conclusion of the Anglo-(Previous Italian Agreement had made a deep impression in ItalyReference:Cabinet 19       There was no doubt, he thought, that -from that point(3 8), Con-clusion 1.)     of viev.- the effort which the Prime Minister and the^3S\k. cabinet, had decided to ma.ke had been well justified.The Prime Minister said, that the Opposition had asked -for a. Debate on the Agreement, to take placeon Monday next, May 2nd., and had asked that theGovernment would put down a Resolution.    He saw noobjection to this.The Cabinet agreed  That the arrangements for a. Parlia-mentary Debate should be discussed,between the Prime Minister and theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs.-1-
2, The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that the agreed Agenda for the forthcomingConversations between the British and French Govern-ments included the following:-(l) Anglo-Tta.lia.n Relations an&apos;1 Franco-Itclirn. Relations.(2) The Council Meeting at Geneva, inrespect morp particularly toAbyssinia.(3) Spain.(4)  Czechoslovakia.(5) Economic Problems of Central Europe.(6) Future Relations with Germany.(7) Staff Talks,as well as several less important questions.Referring to item (l)  above, the line hepropose^ should be taken by the Prime Minister and himself was to report the results of our ownConversations with Italy and to explain the valuewe attached to them:    and a.t the same time to urge the French to follow our example.Referring to item (2), he had talked to theSecret0ry-General of the League of Nations on theprevious day.     M. Avenol had. adopted rather acynically helpful and hopeful ma-nrier.   His main object appeared to ^e to protect the League ofNations against having to decide any very difficult questions of principle.   He had. thought that it-would be unnecessary to remit the question to theAssembly.   He had suggested that the Council wouldprobably decide that the Negus was not a. person towhom, an invitation to attend the League could,properly be sent, so that in all probability hiscredentials would not be recognised.   At a. later
stage the Foreign Secretary explained that theCouncil had no Credential^ Committee but decided thequestion itself by * majority.    Continuing, he saidthat M. Avenol had. thought that a Liberating Resolu-tion could not &quot;be obtained.    Tf that ai-pe^redprobable, it woul^ be better not to make the attemptbut rather for speeches to be made by the various members.    At the end of the discussion the Chairman,who was the Foreign Secretary of Latvia, a country which had already recognised the Italian position,would sum up and. would probably conclude by sayingthat every nation was entitled to do as it thoughtright.    In that event the position would not be toobad.    The Foreign Secretary added, th^t he had giventhe Italian Government a general warning that acertain number of unpleasant things were bound to besaid, about them at this meeting of the Council.   Hethought they understood the position.Some discussion took place on this question,and the Foreign Secretary informed his colleagues thatmighthe/propose   that, as a matter of courtesy, a repre-sentative of the Negus of Abyssinia, should be allowedto make a speech at the Council.On the subject of Spain the Foreign secretary said. that, he had nothing to add as to the position.A suggestion had been made that the Italian andFrench Governments might s.gree mutually to withdraw their troops from Spain,   He gathered that the french were rather interested in the proposal.    In that event the danger would be that the Germans would bein Spain.left/   On the question of mediation he drew theattention of the Cabinet to ^telegram No.84, of
22nd April, from Sir R* Hodgson, in which he had suggested that General Franco&apos;s Government might be interested.    The Foreign Secretary had authorised.Sir R. Hodgson to explore th? possibilities of some action, but did not wish to encourage false hopesamong his  colleagues.VwTR^b ^TIOPE. The Foreign Secr^t^ry said that CzechoslovakiaCzechoslovakia,   was the most dangerous point, and. he had been giving&quot;previous it most anxious  consideration.    It was, of course,Reference:C8binet 19 impossible to predict the future or to know exactly(38) , Con-elusion 2.) what, might be the German intentions.    For his partr:K22f^)3. he was anxious  to lend full support  to anything whichmight help European peace.    We should have to make clear that we could not a-ssume any military commitment,for the reasons that had been stated in the House ofCommons by the Prime Minister, and also because ourstudies of the military aspects had shown the diffi-culties involved, especially as the German fortifications-tions in the Rhineland ne-^red  completion.    Owing tothe difficulty of bringing immediate and direct aid to czechoslovakia,  it resulted, that, if Germany acted,the position could only be restored, by a war lastingfor years before victory was achieved.   He would point.out that neither we nor France were eo^uipped for warwith Germany, and  that, in any event,  even after a.long war, it would be very difficult, to re-establishCzechoslovakia in her old position.   He thought it.necessary to begin by fa cine the problem in some suchrealistic spirit as the a.bove.   At the same time itwas important, first, not to let the Germans thinkthat they could do everything they liked;    second, notto let Dr. Benes think that he need make no greatl* effort;    and, third, that neither the French nor weshould place ourselves in a. position of being humiliatedby a German rejection of Czechoslovak proposals:    inother words, we should avoid sponsoring those proposals.-4-
That, however, need not prevent us from saying toGermany that she could, apparently get, say, 50 percent, of what she required by negotiation, and askingwhy she should face the risk of a European war inorder to get 100 per  uent.Tn reply to questions as to how far Dr. Henleinwas supported by Sudeten-Deutsch opinion, he saidthat information reaching the Foreign Office indicated,firstly, that German opinion in Czechoslovakia wasrallying to Dr. Henlein, and, secondly, that Henleinwas more and more coming under the influence of herr Hitler.    It seemed probable that Dr. Henlein&apos;sproposals were unacceptable to Dr. Benes, and thatthe latter&apos;s proposals did not go far enough to meetthe Sudeten-Deutsch.CENTRAL EUROPEEconomi cProblems of.(previous reference:Cabinet 2^(32),  Con-clusion 6.)The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat on the subject of the economic problems of central Europe he understood that the French were going to produce an argument advocating a. Danubiananti-German bioc.   His own advice was that the moment-was not suitable and that the plan was not feasible.In order to carry it out it was necessary to ma.keprovision for taking the exports of the central european countries, and the whole proposal would bevery strongly opposed by Germany.   Ther^ was, however,a good deal to be done, he thought, by handling each country separately, and his own intention was to explore the question country by country and see what could be done in each.   He agreed with the HomeSecretary, who had raised the question, that thematter was one of considerable importance.
GERMANY.FutureRela tionswith.(previous reference:Cabinet 11(38), Con-clusion 4 k)STAFF CON-VERSA T TONS .On the subject of future relations with germany the Foreign Secretary said that he proposed to takethe line that we were anxious to pursue the interruptednegotiations but that the present moment did not appearopportune.(This subject, which was included, inthe Foreign Secretary&apos;s review, is,as a matter of convenience, dealtwith in a separate Conclusion.)The Cabinet agreed  To approve generally the line proposedby the Foreign Secretary on all theabove points.
PRANCE.Propos edStaff Con-versations .(previous reference:Cabinet 19(38), Con-clusion 4.)3, The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said the line he proposed that he and the PrimeMinister should take on the subject of Staff Gonversa-tions should, be to emphasise that the principal formin which we could aid France, if the Government ofthe day should so decide, would be by sea and air.Naval Conversations did not appeDr necessary at thepresent time, but we should he glad, to initiateConversations between the Air Staffs, which mightstart on the le el of Air Attaches and possibly laterbe continuedi on the plane of more senior representatives .A StaffsAs to the Army/ he would propose to say that,having regard to our obligations in the matter ofhome defence and the defence of territories overseas and the large reorganisation that we were undertaking,the greatest measure o^ help that the Government ofthe day, after considering their other military commitments and  if they decided to despatch any military &quot;force to France,  could give, would be two divisions, and n Kohili Div it-iijft..    Of course if thesitua+ion was modified later we should let the FrenchGovernment know.    Tn the meantime he hoped that thisMilitarywould lead them to accept the conclusion that no/staff conversations were necessa.ry at the present time.suchIf, however, the French were to press for/Conversa-tions, it would be difficult to refuse them.    Theymight argue that no-one  could, foresee what would happen in war, and they might say that in their view the German Army would probably invade France throughPelgium, in which event they presumed that we, beingas much interested in the Channel Ports as they, would feel bound to throw in all the forces we could.
He-would-bf glad, therefore, if some latitude couldbe given to the Prime Minister and himself as toacquiescing in Conversations between the MilitaryStaffs if they were strongly pressed,    &quot;&quot;he real safe-guard was the initial warning we intended to give asto the form, in which we proposed to render assistancea.n^ the limit at ion,  even if we could give military assistance, to two Divisions. an&amp;-g* MobllwThe Prime Minister recalled thot the original decision of the Cabinet had. been in favour of MilitaryStaff Conversations.    Tt had. been modified at theMeeting referred to in the margin, at thp request ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence.   mhe suggestion had always been that the very limited amount, of military assistance that we could give would  come a.s a severeshock to the French Government.   He himself had nevershared that view .    The Yar Office General Staff had urged that if Conversations were permitted it would,become impossible to avoid greater commitments;    8.ndthis was one of the principal grounds which had. led himto think that it would be better if no Conversationstook place.    On reflection, however, he was inclined toagree with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Having begun by saying how we proposed to distributeour resources, and having impressed on the french ministers that our maximum Army contribution, if we gave one at all,  could not exceed, two Divisions and.Mobile Division at the outset of a war, he thought itwould, be difficult to refuse if the French wanted tohave Conversations as to how that force could be used,if it was sent.    He had gathered from theSecretary of State for Va.r, who had recently seenGeneral Gamelin, that in the General&apos;s view the Germans
might begin a war by a very rapid advance throughBelgium.   mo refuse a request for Conversationsunder severely limited  conditions would seem ratherchurlish.   He therefore supported the foreign secretary&apos;s request for some latitude;    the more soas he himself was determined at the present stagenot to undertake any commitment for sending anylarger force at the outset of a war, though he had never rejected the idea, of sending military forcesat a. later stage.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, while willingto give the desired latitude to the Prime Ministerand Foreign Secretary, pointed out the risk of comingso near the point of a. commitment to send, the limited force of two Divisions a ad a Mob 11 o D-i u gg iu that it would be assumed by the French as a definiteundertaking.    There was a distinction between sayingthat the maximum force that  could be sent, if anyforee were sent, would be limited to two Divisionsoad a Mobile- Dii&apos; ii, iun1, and saying that in certaincircumstances we would be willinc to send a force ofthis size.    Ifthe matter were presented in the latterform, the French might be led to make their plans on the assumption that we were committed,    &quot;he danger was that France would assume that, while no largerfo^ee could be expected at the outset of a war, wewere committed to send the smaller force.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterrecalled that, before the  Var we never promised, thatif we sent a force at. all we would send more than our small &quot;Expeditionary Force.   He had it, however,on authority which he considered, as good as officialauthority, that French Ministers had led. their own
people into thinking that, this would commit us tosend larger forces .-.   He urged the utmost  caution inany commitment, as he was  convinced that it would notbe possible to send to the Continent a large Army inaddition to our effort at sea. and in the air.The Secretary of State for Var said that theFrench would want a military contribution, howeversmall, for supporting the moral of their people.    Hethought the easiest way of ha.ndlinp the question wasto emphasise the value of our contribution in formsother than land forces, as well as the difficulties that we should ha.ve in giving military assistance:for example, o^ing to our commitments  in other partsof the world.    France recognised, the importance ofother parts of the world, and would offer assistancefrom Co chin-China, in the case of Hong-xrong, and incontaining Gpoin to safeguard the position at Gibraltar.By adopting that  course we micht get the conversations on a satisfactory plane.     /e should have to admit,however, that, in certain.in circumstances we might haveto send troops to Prance, including the later stages of a. war.    He thought,  therefore, that the PrimeMinister and Foreign Secretary should be given thelatitude they desired ^   He thought, however,  that a.stipulation shoul^ be made that the Staff conversations should be kept on rather broad and general lines,and that  the representatives of the Staffs should notbe encouraged to get down to quest ions of detail.The Secretary of St^te for Air, while favouringgiving the latitude desired,  felt some doubt as towhether the Military Conversations  could be kept on general lineso    ^he Air Staff Conversations would haveto deal with matters of very considerable detail,
such as aerodromes, routes, an^ so forth. Tt wouldbe difficult to engage in these on the Air side andto keep the Military Conversations general.The Home Secretary suggested that the first stagewas to say that we could not guarantee to send a. force to france even in the event of an invasion of Belgiumor in order to hold the line.    That having been accepted,we might  consider whether more detailed talks were possible .The President of the Board of Education suggestedthat the right  course w*s to say that in certaincircumstances we might be able to send a. force whichwould be limited in the first, instance to two Divisions..and n Mofoalo JJivaoion.   We should, however, keep open the possibility of usine our sea-power, e .g., for landing our force behind the German advance.The Foreign Secretary thought there was no great difference between members of the Cabinet.    Everyonewas anxious to avoid  commitments.   He agreed with theHome Secretary that it was important to make plain atthe outset that we could not  commit ourselves to send,any troops to the Continent.    Put. it was also important not to say that in no circumstances would we ever sendany troops .    In that event France must prepare, her plans on alternative assumptions.    Given these safeguardshe did not see why we should not expladn what action we should take if we were in a. position to send, alimited force, and to discuss it in Staff Conversa-tions.The Prime Minister said that all he asked was forsome latitude to be able to say that the Governmentwould permit Conversations between the Military Staffs.
He himself was very cautious, and he did not forgetthe observation attributed to Marshal Poeh, that ifwe sent one trooper we should he fully  committed.If he and Lord Halifax were asked by the Cabinet tosay th0t in no circumstances would they allow anyStaff Conversations, there might be an uncomfortablejar.The Lord President of the Council thought thatthe Cabinet were agreed that there was no question ofa. commitment to sen1 any force to the Continent.Previous decisions rendered any such commitment impos-sible.    Provided that it was explained to the French that no commitment  could he made, he thought  the PrimeMinister and. the Foreign Secretary might  then say that,on that hypothesis, if the French thought Conversationswere worth while we shoul^ not object.   He could seethat the^e would be a nasty jar if the French proposal was refused altogether.The question was raised as to whether any communi-cation shoul^ be made to Germany about  the- staff conversations .The Lord Chancellor suggested, that it would be advisable to inform the German Government that the steps -that were being taken were not  conceived in an aggressive spirit towards Germany *   He suggested that german suspicions were being aroused by the coincidenceof three entirely sepa.ra.te sets of events, namely, thedevelopment of the question of the Sudeten Deutsch in czechoslovakia.:    the despatch of an Air Mission tothe United States of America&quot;,    an^ the conversations with France.    there seemed to be a risk that these three events might result in stimulating Herr Hitlerinto action before he intended, before we could obtain
any aeroplanes from America, before arrangements couldbe made for- co-operation with France, and before ourarmaments had made substantial progress.The Prime Minister thought it was unnecessary toassume that the result of the German concern in these three questions would be a coup against CzechoslovakiaLu.1-In this  connection the attention of the cabinet was drawn to a telegram that had been circulated bythe Foreign Office the same morning 1 Berlin TelegramNo. 213 Saving, 2^th April) which began as follows:-&quot;The rumours that extended Staff conversa-tions are to be the principal subject ofthe Anglo-French Conversations this week,coupled with the prospect of United Statesaeroplane deliveries to Great Britain, arecausing not a. little apprehension anddispleasure in the Germa.n press&quot;.It was pointed out that the German Government hadalready allowed their Press to stir up German publicopinion on these, matters.The Prime Minister thought it might be possibleto instruct His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlin to make an appropriate communication to the German Governmentin order to induce the Germans not  to exaggerate theimportance of these Conversations .The Minister ror Co-ordination of Defence strongly supported a communication being made to Germany.^he Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out. that air Staff Conversations, which presumably might  extend to such matters as the selection of targets,  could hardly be represented as innocuous.The Secretary o^ State for Foreign Affairs thoughtthat, the general view of the Cabinet was in favour ofmaking a  communication to Germany.    Personally he didnot dissent .   He himself was inclined, to think that
9 ft 0Herr Hitler and the leading people in Germany were notvery much concerned at the Staff Conversations.   he asked for time to consider the proposal further.The Cabinet agreed  (a) Th^t the Prime Minister and the foreign secretary, who undertook to givecareful consideration to the views expressed in the discussion, should havelatitude, if they thought it necessary and desirable, to agree to extend, theStaff Conversations to the Army Staffs:(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should consider making an appro-priste communication to the GermanGovernment in order to deter them from taking an exaggerated view of theimportance of the proposed staff conversations.-14-
2QiFOOD, GOALand oil supplies inwar.\* xchange ofInformationdth therench andBelgianGovernments,I (previous reference;Cabinet 4 (38)Conclusion 8.)4,     The Minister for Go-ordination of Defenceinformed the Cabinet that just before Easter a letterfrom the Foreign Office had been circulated to theCommittee of Imperial Defence asking the Committee toconsider proposals that had been received from theFrench Government, with a view to informal conversations for the purpose of economiccollaboration in the event of war.     The ForeignOffice had also suggested the conditions in which theproposed conversations should take place.      TheSecretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence had just received a further letter from the ForeignOffice intimating that the French Government had suggested and   His Majesty&apos;s Government had agreed thatthis question should be placed on the Agenda of the conversations to be held on the morrow with theFrench Prime Minister and the Minister for ForeignAffairs,      In these circumstances, the Foreign office had asked that a decision should be taken as early as possible to authorise conversations on thesematters between the competent authorities of the twoGovernments.     He asked that the Gabinet shouldapprove the proposal in principle and leave theCommittee of Imperial Defence to consider the generalpolicy to be followed and the machinery to be adopted for carrying out the conversations at their meetingon the following day0The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsstrongly supported the proposal and recalled that atthe meeting referred to in the margin, the cabinet had already approved similar conversations with theBelgian Government.     He thought these conversationswould be as useful to ourselves as to the French
Government with a view to avoiding competition in neutralmarkets in the event of war.     It would also give great satisfaction in France,The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out thatthere was some risk that the combination of Staff talksand conversations on economic subjects would cumulativelygive the impression that we were combining with france in defensive preparations against Germany.     No doubt the conversations would please the French Government, but hethought the Cabinet ought to consider what would be theeffect on the Prime Minister1s desire eventually to cometo an agreement with Germany.Several members of the Cabinet expressedapprehension as to the effect of these proposals beingtaken together.     They would give the French the impression that we were behind them and that they could continue pastpolicies towards Germany.     Doubts were expressed as towhether conversations were necessary.The Foreign Secretary appealed for considerationof this proposal as part of the whole European picture.At the moment, the danger to peace in Europe lay in Czecho-Slovakia,     On that matter, he thought that we ought to be&quot;brutally frank and make olear that nothing was to be gained by military action.     Having made that solid contribution towards European peace, it was important not to impair thecordiality of the French, though it was equally important not to antagonise Germany.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence recalled that the conversations with Belgium had been sanctioned by theCabinet &quot;on the understanding that the Minister would make sure that no commitments by His Majesty&apos;s Government were involved in respect of any supplies which it appeared probablethat we could undertake for Belgium in time of war&quot;.- 16 -
The Foreign Secretary recalled that thequestion of food-stuffs was already being discussed withthe French Government.A suggestion was made that the exchange ofinformation on the war aspects of this question mightbe linked up with the larger question of economicinternational organisation in time of peace which was at present to the fore:    for example, in connectionwith sugar and meato     The question was raised also as to how it would be possible to justify staff conversations and to refuse economic conversations.The Prime Minister pointed out that it wasnot a question of logic0     Logically, if we enteredinto one kind of conversations, we should enter intothe other.     He himself did not feel, however, thatto enter on these conversations would do much to add to the doubts which must inevitably be aroused inGermany by Staff conversations.     He thoughtthat action of this kind would not have a bad effect,in view of the present mentality of the GermanGovernment which only appeared to be effected by adisplay of force.The Minister for Go-ordination of defence pointed out that if a communication was to be made toGermany, information as to these conversations would bethe most innocuous that could be given.The Foreign Secretary agreed that it was not-a matter of logic.     He realised the misgivings ofsome of his colleagues on what might be called theStaff conversations atmosphere0     He thought it possibleto suggest that we were sympathetic to the idea, but toarrange that the first interchange should be made in theform of written memoranda,,
The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggestedthat the matter should he loft to   the discretion of th*Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary.The Minister of Health agreed and urged thatwe must not drift hack into the old position where wewere always consenting to everything asked &quot;by Franceand refusing all the German requests.The Cabinet agreed:That, at the forthcoming conversations with the French Government, the questionof the exchange of information on thesupply of food, oil and coal in war should be left to the discretion of thePrime Minister and the foreign secretary, who would bear in mind theviews of their colleagues as presentedduring the above discussion.
5. The Cabinet had before them a Most SecretFurther Report by the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence (CP.-99 (38)) on Defence Expenditure inFuture Years, in which he recommended approval ofthe Secretary of State for War&apos;s detailed, proposalsfor the settlement of the War Office allocation(attached, as Appendix IT to the Memorandum) .   Theeffect of these proposals was to reduce the WarOffice defence requirements programme from  347millions (CP.-24 (38))  to a new total of  277millions .   At the same time the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence pointed out in his memorandum the consequences involved, in acceptance of theproposals and called attention to the importance ofcertain of them, particularly those relating to theField Force and the Air Defence of Great Britain,upon which he submitted explanatory notes.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence,in submitting his proposals for approval, said hehad felt bound to call attention to the serious effects of some of the cuts proposed by the Secretaryof State for War which he had set forth in his memorandum in detail, namely -para. 4 Field Force and Territorial Armypara. 5 Air Defence of Great Britainpara. 6. Rearmament at Malta and Gibraltar.Of the above,  the most important was the effect   ofthe proposals on the Air Defence of Great britain as shown by the following figures:-Original Programme; 608 guns108 searchlight companiesRevised Scheme (1937):       1264 guns196 searchlight companiesPresent Scheme: 928 guns152 searchlight companiesThe present Scheme,  therefore, provided for 336 fewerguns than t** revised Scheme of 1937 and no less than- 19 -
3S0 of the guns provided therein were to he theobsolescent 3-inch compared with the modern guns to beprovided in the 1937 Scheme.     The 1937 Scheme, he pointed out, had not been considered as in any way an over-estimate of our needs.     He also emphasised that theField Force would have reduced reserves and that when,as was bound to happen sooner or later, it became known that the Territorial Army was to receive onlytraining equipment and v/as not to be used in the eventof war for 12 months, the present impetus torecruiting was bound to be affected adversely,F.R.21 (i^)&apos;&apos;2-.Referring to   an Intelligence Report on the german army that was to be considered by the Committee ofImperial Defence at its meeting on ihe morrow (C.I.D.Paper No.l421-B), he pointed out that,while we were making these cuts in our original military programmes,the German Army was reported to be in a position to putinto the field from 4 to 6 armoured divisions and108 infantry divisions apart from independent units and a certain number of Landwehr divisions, though there seemed to be some doubts as to whether so large a force could be maintained in the field.The Home Secretary, as the minister responsible for Air Raid Precautions, pointed out therisk of halving the number of modern guns contemplated in the 1937 Scheme.     The 3-inch guns, of which therewould be 320, were considered by the Naval Staff whenhe was First Lord to be almost valueless, and his ownAir Raid Precautions Staff took the same view.     he urged that the Cabinet should consider very carefullybefore deciding to halve the programme of modern gunsand that the acceleration of the production of 3.7-inch guns should be examined.
The Minister for Co-ordination of defence said that the tendency of competent expert authoritieswas against under-rating the value of the 3-inch gun.   Hesaid that action had already &quot;been taken at Woolwich and elsewhere to expedite the output of modern guns.     Thedanger of excessive acceleration, however, was shown &quot;bythe &quot;fact that a considerable -number of forgings had beenruined at the new Government factory at Nottingham bythe desire to get on fast.     Nevertheless, 3.7-inch guns were now coming out of the factories for proof in muchgreater numbers.ThevChancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterpointed out that during the past year under government authority, the Territorial Army had been told that theywould have^ modern equipment to enable them to take thefield.     As a member of the Territorial association with manyvyears experience, he warned his colleagues thatthe whole system of recruiting would break down if itwere,discovered that the scale was to be limited to training equipment.The Secretary of State for War said he regarded his own proposals with mingled satisfactionand sorrow.     On the one hand, he was glad to obtain a definite programme to which he could work, for any amendment thereof involved recalculation over the wholefield.     On the other hand, he much regretted that his proposals involved the scrapping of earlier decisions as to the Role of the Army.     He had, however, been told to reduce his estimates by  70 millions and thiswas the best plan the War Office could produce.     he agreed that the recruiting of the Territorial army would eventually be affected, but it need notnecessarily be known that the Territorial Army would not
be in a position to take the field until a year afterthe outbreak of war.  the effect of which would be particularly discouraging.     His greatest regret,however, was on the grounds of national safety.     Healeo greatly regretted that improved accommodationcould not be provided.     He had Wanted to reassure theArmy on this point.     He did not feel very much concerned as to the cuts in anti-aircraft defences,the provision of which must in any event take a very long time.     The present position was adequate inrelation to the programme as a whole.^ He was not undulydisturbed by the postponement of the rearmament of malta and Gibraltar in view of our improved relations with italy.     One aspect of the question that had to beremembered was that the less plant we had the lesswe could produce.      In view of the cuts ordered bythe Cabinet, however, it was impossible to do better.Referring to the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster&apos;s remarks, he thought that some announcement would have to be made to the effect that there was a limit on possible expenditure.The Prime Minister pointed out that theChancellor of the exchequers Budget Speech on theprevious day provided a formidable warning.     he understood that anti-aircraft guns were beingaccelerated to the utmost and that guns were actuallybeing produced as fast as was possible.      It might bethat the paper programme compared with the programmeof 1937 was decreased, but as time went on and theoutput of guns increased the question could be re-examined.     In the meanwhile, all the available plant was being utilised.
The Minister for Co-ordination of Defenceentered a caveat against any excessive optimism asto the output of guns.The Home Secretary said he had learntthat some acceleration was now considered possible.This surprised him the more because for two years hehad been urging acceleration at the Committee ofImperial Defence and hitherto he had been told thatit was impossible0The Minister for Co-ordination pointed outthat under this programme, we should be usingproductive capacity for the production of anti-aircraft guns to a maximum.     If, as we approached the end of 19&apos;19, we found that more could be done,fresh decisions could be taken,     As a matter of fact,however, the factories had their work cut out forthem to complete the original programme of 608 gunsby 1939 when a fresh review was due.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterthought that the public did not realise thefinancial limitationso     Members of Parliament seemedto be under the impression that the War Office andthe Air Ministry had carte -branches0The Secretary of State for Scotland supported the Home Secretary as to the vital need for anti-aircraft defences.     He wished to know whether theWar Office and the Air Ministry considered theseproposals sufficient.The Secretary of State for Air said that ashe understood the matter the proposals were not putforward by the Secretary of State for War as a schemeof defence considered adequate by the staffso     The
Pi 3W I. fj1937&quot;s--3oheme^which..had been given the -unfortunatetitle of the &quot;Ideal.Scheme&quot; had in fact   been acceptedby the Committee of Imperial Defence as by no meansproviding an over-insurance.      Neither the Air Staffnor the General Staff considered the new proposals asthe defence that we ought to have, but merely as the &apos;,best that could be got having regard to the variouslimi tations0The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed outthat the War Office had in the past been handicapped by the lack of a balanced programme     This was anopportunity to authorise them to go ahead with such aprogramme0     There might be omissions from theprogramme that all must regret, but he had satisfiedhimself that the carrying out of this programme wouldoccupy the v/hole of the capacity available to the WarOffice.      It would be a great responsibility for theCabinet to throw the programme back for reconsideration,which would involve further delay.     There was a vastdifference between what could be accomplished and   a paper programme.      If it should turn out that it waspossible to carry out the programme more rapidly, then the War Office ought to bring it to the attention ofthe Cabinet.The Foreign Secretary agreed that it wasuseless to order guns that could not be supplied, butif more could be obtained than provided for in thepresent programme, the question ought to be looked into again.The Prime Minister said that the rate ofproduction ought to be watched with the sharpest eye
but in the meanwhile the programme ought to be approved.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the programme for defence expenditure in Future Yearssubmitted by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (CP. 99 (38))which, it was noted, would occupy the whole of the manufacturingresources available to the War Officeduring the next two years:(b) That, if in practice it should befound possible at any time to accelerate or increase the programmeof anti-aircraft defences, theSecretary of State for War should bring the matter through theappropriate channels to the Cabinet.
THE AIR 6.    The Secretary of State for Air recalled that programme:--- in his Memorandum (CP-  87(38)) he had put forward aproposals for     programme for further expansion and accelerationaccelaration of.(Scheme &quot;L&quot;) which he had asked the Cabinet to(Previous Ref-erence Cabinet approve.    Scheme &quot;L;l aimed at producing the follow-19(38) Con-elusion 8.)       ing results by the 31st March,  1940, viz:-(a)   The following increase in Metropolitanfirst-line strength as compared withScheme :,F&quot; which had been authorised:-A-aircraft First-line Strength.Scheme &quot;F&quot;.        Scheme &quot;L&quot;.Bombers 990 1,352Fighters 420 608General Reconnaissanceincluding Flying Boats     194 281Army Co-operation 132 1321,736 2,373These figures omitted arfte-re-as^s-i-a the L&apos;r*t-Fleet Air Arm (400 machines) and       J?o-J- 1-**.Overseas Strength (474 machines).(b) In addition to this first-line strength,the complete reserves on the &quot;KM scaleshould be provided.(c) In addition a sufficient number of aircraft should be provided for training thelarge Air Force and the expanded reserve.He emphasised the importance oi* this asthe volunteer reserve was doing very welland being passed on to service machinessooner than he had anticipated.Broadly, this combination of expansion andacceleration required the provision ofsome 12,000 aircraft in&quot;2 years.
These proposals were referred by the Cabinet tothe Prime Minister,  Chancellor of the Exchequer,  Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence and himself.    As the resultof their discussions the Prime Minister asked that thereshould be a further careful appreciation of the maximumoutput which could be obtained within the 2 years up to31st March, 1940.    We should aim at the dual purpose bothof securing acceleration of suitable types now in productionand of bringing into production as early as possible thelatest improved types.This review had now been completed in close consultation v/ith Sir Charles Bruce-Gardner and individual firms.    The result of this review was a productionestimate of approximately 4,000 aircraft by 31st March,1939,  and a further 8,000 aircraft by 31st March,   1940.This was exclusive of the possibility of American purchases of special types which it had been thought wiser to treat,for the purposes of estimate,  as a contingent reserve.Broadly,  therefore, Sir Charles Bruce-Gardner and theindustry estimated that the plan for securing the first2 years of Scheme &quot;L&quot; by 31st March,  1940,  ought to be substantially achieved.Care had been taken in framing the details of theprogramme to secure from firms the maximum of suitabletypes now in production,  and to avoid as far as possibleany gap in change over, but  at the same time to regulatenumbers so as to encourage the earliest possible intro-duction of improved types.This accelerated and increased production comparedwith an estimated output of approximately 7,500 aircraftunder the programme authorised hitherto,  and working under normal conditions.Increased production on the scale envisaged was dependent on two factors:--27-
(a) Adequate premises, plant and orders.    Asregards this, there was no difficulty.    Itwas not a question of providing a numberof new factories.    Factories, bothprofessional and shadow, have been planned and expanded and orders placed on a scaledesigned to table  the strain of accelerationand expansion if a decision in that senseshould be taken.    The extensions of buildings and plant required for theincreased production now budgeted forwere not large,  and all were worked out.The additional numbers of aircraft requiredto be ordered to complete this 2-year programme had also been worked out.It was intended that there should also be certain further shadow factories establish-ed for the purpose of increasing the war potential; for example,  there were to bebig extensions in Belfast, but these were for war potential and not essential to the12,000 machines he was discussing.(b) Labour reinforcement.    The estimates hadbeen made after careful consideration byfirms as to the prospect of securingadditional labour in their respectivedistricts.    On this it was more difficultto be dogmatic, but the programme was based on the considered opinion of the firms of what should be possible, givengeneral goodwill.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor of theExchequer had authorised the Air Ministry to proceed on thebasis of this estimate.In order that the specific authority might be quickly obtained for all action necessary to give effectto the expanded and accelerated programme, the chancellor had agreed that a Treasury Officer should sit in with theAir Ministry with full financial authority.    Sir CharlesBruce-Gardner,  who had been working both with the AirMinistry and the Industry in preparing the programme,would also continue to work on the  special Committee inthe Air Ministry which was charged with giving immediate effect to the programme.    This Committee would beginits work this week.The Prime Minister said that in the production of aircraft    as of anti-aircraft    guns he was much impressed by the difference between paper programmes and achievements.In his view, the critical time was the next 2 years.    he did not say that the situation would necessarily be easier then, but he thought that the international situation would at any rate have changed.    For the moment the mainthing was to obtain the maximum production over the next 2years.    For that reason it had been decided to go to theaircraft firms and ask them what was the maximum theycould turn out.    He would rather not relate the figures to any particular programme, but to consider them as themost optimistic estimate that the firms could give onthe assumption that all we it well.    In the House ofCommons there had been much criticism both of theGovernment and the firms,  and the accusation was beingmade that the firms had been held up by changes in design or in policy or by vacillation,  and that their
capacity had not even been fully used.    He would not discuss that.    It did seem to be true, however, that someof the firms had actually discharged hands.    On top of thatcame the news that a Mission had been sent to America,  andthat had been represented as an admission that our own industry had broken down.    The statement made by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster on the previous day had, however,  had some corrective effect.    The steps that had now been taken were, he thought, sufficient to meetthe criticism of the aircraft industry.    He warned theCabinet against placing too much reliance on the figures.Possibly some of the assumptions might be unwarranted.The developments contemplated in the organisation of the AirMinistry, however meant that the branches engaged with productionand research would be amalgamated under a single head,  andthat head,  together with Sir Charles Bruce-Cardner and arepresentative of the Treasury, would see that the ordersgiven were within the power of the industry to carry out and that no delays were permitted.    This should do a greatdeal to speed matters up.    Criticisms must still beexpected,  especially from Mr. Winston Churchill, but he hoped that the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster nowfelt that he had a good answer,  and everything possiblewas being done to meet the situation and keep the firmsextended to their uttermost capacity.    It would,  of course,be said that other firms might have been called in to dothe work, but that proposal probably emanated frominterested quarters who did not really know the business.The firms that did know, however, would now be re-assured.He then gave an indication of the form which the cabinet decision should in his view take (see Conclusionsbelow).
The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said thathe had been Chairman of the Air Ministry Committee that had drawn up the programme,  and he was also Chairman ofthe Committee that was to execute it.    He thought it waspossible to make a case in the House of Commons,  and,above all,  to meet the suggestion that had been made thatthe Government had hot got a grip of the situation.The Foreign Secretary asked whether better valuecould not be obtained for money by providing more fighters and fewer bombers.    Fighters were smaller and cheaper and could be supplied in greater numbers and they were theprinciple deterrent to the enemy s bombers.(The First Lord of the Admiralty left atthis point).The Secretary of State for Air said that the numberof fighters was calculated on the basis of the numbers required to meet the enemy bombers that could reach thiscountry.    A larger reserve was provided for fighters than for bombers.    The whole Scheme was a carefully balancedone, but the fighter programme would occupy the whole ofthe capacity of the industry available for that purpose.He himself had seen representatives of all the firms.    Thereal difficulty that they put forward was not alterations in design,  but the fact that it had been impossible for is) uw,the Air Panao to give decisions during recent months.The Cabinet agreed:-(a) To take note of the estimate of the aircraft industry that 12,000 aeroplanes couldbe produced within the next 2 years.(b) To authorise the Air Ministry to accept as many aeroplanes as they could obtainup to the maximum of 12,000 machines inthe next 2 years.
(c)    To take note that these decisions wouldinvolve an expenditure during the next2 years that would exceed the figurescontemplated for those years, but notthe total of  1,650 millions providedfor the Defence Services during thenext 5 years,  and that the cabinet were not committed to that rate ofexpenditure beyond 1940.
IllUNEMPLOYMENTASSISTANCE.WinterAllowances .(previous reference:Cabinet 66(36) , Con-clusion 10,)7. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Labour (C.P.-97 (38)) recommendingCabinet concurrence in proposals by the unemployment assistance Board (i) to withdraw during May theincrease in allowances authorised by the Board, inOctober last on account of the increased, price of commodities during the winter, and. (ii) to prepare a. new Regulation to enable the Board, to make appro-priate increases during the winter months in future years.The question was raised as to whether, for political reasons, it might not be desirable to postpone an announcement of the proposals of theUnemployment Assistance Board for a few days.The Minister of Labour said his original intention had been to make the announcement on thefollov/ing day, but he agreed to re-examine the matter.Subject to the above the Cabinet agreed -To approve the proposals of the Ministerof Labour in CP. 97 (38) as summarised above.-oo-

prevention and TREATMENTOF BLINDNESS(SCOTLAND)BILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 47(37), Con-elusion 12 .)9. The Cabinet had under consideration thePrevention and Treatment of Blindness (Scotland)Bill, introduced, by a Private Member and. down forReport and &quot;&quot;bird Reading in the House of Commons onFriday, 6th May, 1938.The Lord Chancellor informed the Cabinet thatthis Bill had been introduced by a Private Member atthe wish of the Government.The Cabinet agreed -That the Bill should be supported.
10. The Cabinet had under consideration the hire-Purchase Bill, introduced by a Private member and down for Report and Third Reading in the Houseof Commons on Friday, 6th May, 1953.The Lord Chancellor said that this was agood Bill which had already been approved by theCabinet.The Minister of Health, representing thePresident of the Board of Trade, said that at meetings which had taken place on the previous day betweenthe Hire Purchase Traders Association and Miss.Wilkinson the latter had agreed to accept, or,atany rate,not to oppose,amendments to the following effect -(1)    Excluding from the Bill the hire purchasesale for more than  50 of a motor car.(2)    Altering from ^ to ^ the proportion of the hire purchase price that would authorisethe hirer to return the goods and close the transaction (Clause 4),He uvged that these amendments should be supported.The Minister of Agriculture and fisheries said that an amendment had also been proposed to clause (l), page 1, line 7;    after &quot;live stock&quot;insert &quot;under which the hire-purchase price or totalpurchase price, as the case may be, does not exceed the sum of five hundred pounds. &quot;His Department thought that this amendment would increase the usefulness of the Bill.
The Lord Chancellor said that the Attorney-General was in favour of the amendments supported bythe Board of Trade.     Pie understood that the promoters of the Bill were prepared to accept allthe above amendments.     In fact there was every sign of the Bill becoming more and more an agreed measure.The Cabinet agreed -That the Bill should be supported.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.27th April, 1933.
