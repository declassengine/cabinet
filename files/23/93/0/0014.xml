THE CABINET. 1. The Prime Minister referred to an announcementSecretariat.     that had been made on the previous day that. Jhe hadnominated Sir Maurice Hankey, the Secretary to theCabinet, for appointment a.s a Director of the Suez-Canal.    As Sir Maurice Hankey would, not be giving up his post until the 1st August next he did not raisethe question for the purpose of bidding him farewell,but to inform his colleagues as to what he ha.darranged as to his successor.   He was ta.king advantageof the opportunity ot the change to make the new arrangements to conform to developments which had.taken pla.ce during the term of the present holder ofthe appointment.    Pnr example, there was now a Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence and a. Committee of civil research, or, as it was at present termed, theEconomic Advisory Council.   Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;ssuccessor, therefore, would be attached to the office the Offices ofof the Cabinet, which included/the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, the Committee of ImperialDefence and the Economic Advisory Council. ( he considered it essential that one person should beSecretary to the whole Office, thus providing a link between the Cabinet and the Committee of ImperialDefence, which could not. be divided.   He had. therefore decided to appoint a Permanent Secretary to theCabinet Office who would also act as Secretary to theCabinet and who would provide a. link with the Committeeof Imperial rieferice, o^ which he would be an ex offioiomember.] The Official he had selected Was Mr E.E,Bridges, of the Treasury, a son of the late PoetLaureate, a man o^ exceptional ability and brillianceand possessing attractive personal qualities.
Mr Bridges for some time had been the Official inthe Treasury connected with the Defence programme.times,and. was thereforp particularly well known to theDefence Departments.   He himself, at the time he wasChancellor of the Exchequer, had been attracted bythe outstanding quality of Mr Bridges&apos; Minutes on defence questions, and had. made it his business toset acquainted with their author.   Mr Fridges had also been selected recently to sit in at the AirMinistry for purposes of consultation on the accel-eration Qnd expansion of the Air Programme.Under the Permanent Secretary to the cabinet office there would he two principal Officers.   first was the Secretary to the Committee of Imperial DefenceColonel H.Lo Ismay, the present Deputy Secretary tothe Committee of Tmperia.1 Defence, would become theSecretary to the Committee, and the work would becontinued mxuh as at present, though, as already mentioned, Mr Bridges would be an ex QffJcio memberof the Committee of Imperial Defence.   He would not,however, be a member of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, which was a. purely military Committee,nor would he normally be invited to attend it, though this  could he done in case of need.   Imhe second principal Officer was the deputy secretary to the Cabinet o    Sir Rupert Howorth would continue to hol^ this post and v;oulJ also becomeClerk of the Privy Council.   He himself had. learned,from Sir Maurice Hankey that the work o^ the Clerk ofthe Council did a^ fa V)Urpien, more especially for the reason that it was apt to become criticalat the very time when there wa.s pressure on the
Cabinet and/or the Committee of Imperial Defence.In order to avoid the risk of over-working theSecretary to the Cabinet Office he had thought it advisable to combine the post of Clerk of the council with that of the Deputy Secretary to the Cabinet.In addition, there, would be a Principal assistant secretary, three Assistant Secretaries and. certainPrincipals in the Cabinet Office.The Prime Minister added, that, after taking very careful soundings, he was satisfied, that thisarrangement would receive the enthusiastic supportof all eonoerne&apos;1, including the Chiefs of Staff andthe present Secretary to the Cabinet.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that theonly qualification he had to make on the abovearrangements was the loss that the treasury would,suffer from the withdrawal of Mr Bridges .

(Previous Reference: Cabinet 26 (38), Conclusion 1.)



2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that Mr Strang had returned the previous evening and that he had had a short conversation with hime. Mr Strang had written some interesting notes on his visit to Prague, Berlin and Paris, which, with the approval of the Prime Minister, he proposed to circulate. He thought, however, that the Cabinet would like to receive some preliminary account of him impressions.

Mr Strang&apos;s view was that the Germans did not want a "surgical operation" at present if they could obtain a decent settlement in Czechoslovakia without it. Both Mr Newton and Sir Nevile Henderson had laid stress on the foreign Policy aspect of the Czechoslovak problem. Mr Newton had said that "If there was not a single German in Czechoslovakia the Czech-German problem would still exist". Germany had great Powers to the east and to the west of her and felt that Czechoslovakia was thrust into the heart of Germany. If it were possible to solve the foreign policy problem the Sudeten Deutsch problem would settle itself. The German conviction was that they could not walk into Czechoslovakia without trouble. The Germany Army had advised on the side of prudence, for the reason that they were not yet ready for a European war. Mr Strang said that the Germans were not so conscious of our weakness as we ourselves, and they were more concerned with their own weaknesses. For the moment we had stopped the Germany aggression, but all depended on the Czecho-Slovek settlement. Both Sir Nevile Henderson and Sir Eric Phipps agreed that we must now get results from Dr. Benes. They


thought it important to support Dr- Hodza.   He himself had put to Paris the idea of being ready, if negotia-tions broke down, with a proposal for an international commission to try and solve the deadlock.   BothMr Newton and. Sir Nevile Henderson had thought of something of the kind in varying forms independently.The importance of putting pressure on Dr. Benes,however, was distinct from its importance in the caseof Dr. Hodza..    Certain secret information which sir Robert Vansittart had received emphasised the willingness of Herr Henlein to adhere to the proposals he had made in London if he could get. a quick result.uThe Foreign Secretary then read to the Cabinethis telegrams No.142 to Mr Newton (Prague) andNo. 175 to Sir Eric Phipps (Paris)  emphasising theimportance of putting the greatest possible pressure on Dr. Benes in person.   He hoped, that the cabinet would not  consider these messages too stiff.   He had.heen so impressed by the report^ he had received, onthe importance of getting something moving in Czecho-slovakia. that he had thought it right to send, the messages .In reply to a question he said he did not thinkit was worth while approaching the Italian government at the present time,    ^he object of such an approach would only be to get them, to use their influence on germany, and at the moment Germany was not makingtrouble.
SPAIN.Non-Inter-vent ion.(previous reference:Cabinet 26(38) , Con-clusion 2 .)3.    The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that the Non-intervention Committee had held a rather successful meeting on the previous day, parti-eularly on the financial issue.    mhe Chancellor ofthe Exchequer had facilitated matters by agreeing that we should pay one-fourth instead of one-fifth of the cost of/jaon-interynntion.   The Committee wasto meet again on the morrow to consider the situationin the light of the Russian attitude.   He had asked the Earl of Plymouth to try and get other nations to go on with the non-intervention plan,withoutRussia, if necessary.
SPAINr 4.    The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsIndiscriminate     said that he had sent telegrams to General Franco&apos;s* Bombing.Government to protest against indiscriminate airbombing o   He had sent a similar telegram to the earl of Perth   (Rome)  expressing the hope that  if suchbombing was being carried out by Italian aeroplanesthe Italian Government would put a stop to it; andif by other aeroplanes, that they would  co-operate with His Ma. jesty5 s Government in trying to get it.stopped.   He himself had had an analysis made of the&quot;British ships bombed *   They numbered, in all 25 shipsinjured..    In only five cases was the attack believed to be deliberate.    Only a very small number of these ships had been engaged fraudulently.   The latest-case of bombing looked, as though it had been a deliberate attack.   There had been a -nepa.rtmentaldiscussion on the subject, and various proposals had been examined  for dealing with the question,e-g(i) Economic Sanctions..    But. this was rejected on the ground, that it wouldhurt us more than it would hurt general franco *( ii) &quot;&quot;he stationing of war vessels in spanish ports, with orders to shoot,^his was dangerous and not likely tobe effective,( iii) Safety zones   which was still beingexamine d.-.(iv) Skilled Air Observers.      mhe Air Staffcomment, however, was that the numberavailable would not be sufficient togo round, and that it would have no great deterrent effect as the Observerscould not be ubiquitous*(v) Ant.l-air.craft batteries on shore.This, however, was tantamount toint erventiona(vi) The manning of merchant, ships withanti-air.craf t guns., which was not-favoured c
9Q 9It looked, therefore, as though the only possibilitieslay in the direction of(a) Protests,(b) Compensation,( c) Safety Zones .He had, however, recently been thinking that it mightbe worth while to recall Sir R. Hodgson for immediateconsultation, stating publicly that this had. been done and the reason for it.    In addition, the PrimeMinister had suggested that possibly we might seizeMinorca..    The difficulty of this was that Minorcawas owned by the Government.    The project, had. been examined the previous autumn as a possible counter-blast to   an Italian occupation of Majorca, but ithad. been opposed, by the Admiralty.    It would not do much to hoip&apos; General Franco.-In the course of the discussion the suggestion was made that in all probability General Franco wasnot responsible for the bombing of our ships.   Oneof the General1s difficulties was probably that of controlling his pilots, who were of varying national-ities and some of whom were very likely anti-Britishin sentiment.    It must also be very doubtful whetheraeroplanes flying at a. great height, say 10,000 ft.or more,would aim at so small a target as a merchant ship.    It was pointed out, however, that general franco must, accept, responsibility for the damage doneby his for ces .^he First Lord of the Admiralty reported thatthe same morning he had. received a. copy of a telegramfrom Commander Hilgarth, our Consular representative at Palma, reporting a conversation with the Spanish
Admiral Moreno -    It appeared that the sinking of the&quot;THORFFUALL&quot; had. been carried out by a German pilotwho had acted contrary to his orders.    Admiral Morenohad. shown Commander Hilgarth the instruction that ha.dbeen issued, which wa.s that they were not to attackBritish ships or any ships in harbour.    The Germanairman&apos;s services had been dispensed with.The First Lord then pointed out that to send.men-of-war into territorial waters was tantamount to taking part in the war and would endanger ourwarships.    It would also be a. departure from theprinciples to which we had. hitherto adhered, that wewould protect our ships on the high seas but not interritoria.1 waters, which were in the same positionas the territory of Spain.    The particular british ships that had been hit or sunk had been taking tothe Spanish Government supplies which were essential for the continuation of the war.    It could thereforebe argued that they were taking *part in the war and doing it solely in the hope of obtaining * large profit.&quot;&quot;heir action was  just as much a contribution to thecause of the Spanish Government as that of the Intet national Brigade.   A belligerent was quite entitledto bombard ports from the sea, but the Admiralty wouldlike to establish a position in which bombing of portswas illegal.A suggestion was also made that in law there wasno material difference between a British ship in territorial waters and British property on Spanishterritory.    In   either case we. were entitled to demand,compensation, and that was why such operations werenot undertaken more often.
The Prime Minister pointed out that  if, in thepast^ we had taken up the position that  ships inport must run the risk,  it would be logical to ta.keno action.    That, ho^e^er, was not our position.Ve had never admitted that belligerents were entitledto bomb our ships in port, and we had made protestafter protest.    To allow those protests to continueamounted to a. humJ.lia.tion.    If British subjects were killed, whether in a British house or in a british ship, Parliament would not. be sa.tisfied with a mereexposition of the legal position.    No British Govern-ment could afford to be accused week after week of allowing British subjects and their property to be attacked in this way without taking some action.One sugeestion was that if British ships hadbeen bombed by Italian pilots and evidence of this could be found,  the Foreign Secretary should ask the earl of Perth to take the matter up with the ItalianGovernment.    It was recognised, however, that in thecase of the German Government action of this kindwa.s more difficult.The President of the Board of Trade asked that,in any statement to be made,   care should be taken toavoid the suggestion that British ships in Spanishwaters were not there for genuine business reasons,^he va.st majority of ships were there for legitimatepurposes of trade.The First Lord, of the Admiralty pointed out that,even if engaged on legitimate business, they were making very la.^ge profits .^he Secretary of State for &quot;Var suggested thatthe course miaht be followed, which led. to the NyonConference, and that we might propose a Conferenceof the Powers  concerned.
3o rThe Minister of&quot; Labour warned the Cabinet thatfeeling on the subject in the seaports of this country was rising.The Cabinet agreed  To invite the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to consider the various suggestions that had been made in thecourse of the discussion, e.g.(a) That a formal protest should bedrawn up with a view to present-ation to General Franco&apos;s Government.(b) That Sir R. ^c?geon should be recalledfor purposes of discussion.( c)  That Sir R. Hodgson should, in thefirst instance, be consulted as towhether he could make effective use with the Spanish Government of theproposals referred to in (a.) and.(b) above.(6) Representations to the ItalianGovernment in the event of evidencebeing available of the complicityof Italian air pilots in the bombing of British ships.(e) Corresponding action with the GermanGovernment.    This, however, was recognised to be more difficult.(f) The possible summoning of a Conferenceof the interested Powers to considerthe question of the bombing of ships .
5.    The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairesaid that he had not much to report on matters inthe Far East except a conversation with the Japanese-Ambassador, an account of v-hich he was about to circulate.
CENTRAL ANDSOUTH-eastern europe.BritishInfluencein.(previous reference:Cabinet 26(38), Con-elusion 1.)6 . The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C.P.-127(38)) describing the probable results of an extensionof German political, economic and commercial influence in Central and. South-Eastern Europe since the absorp-tion of Austria, and suggesting the desirability ofan effort on the part of Ris Majesty&apos;s Governmentto counteract, them.    This might best be promoted by the setting up of an Inter-Departmental Committeewhose task it would be to examine with the least possible delay the requests already received, from certain countries for economic assistance and. theresults of the Board of Trade inquiry into thepossibility of the United. Kingdom increasing herimports from the countries in question, and to makeavailahle to the Cabinet Committee on Foreign Policyfull material for judgment upon the political, aswell as upon the economic, implications of any action that seemed possible.    Such an Tnt er-department.rtmentalCommittee should contain representatives of theForeign Office, Treasury, Board of Trade, Export-Credits Guarantee Department and. Department of Over-seas Tra.de, with power to co-opt representatives from other Departments and to invite the assistanceof private interests as required.After a short discussion the Cabinet, agreed  (a) &quot;hat the Secretary of State&apos;s Memorandum( CP.-127 (38))  should be referred in thefirst instance to the Cabinet Committeeon Foreign Policy, who should be invitedto set up an Inter-Departmental Committeeto consider the technical aspects of thequestion,    &quot;he Committee on ForeignPolicy should be given discretion ^Qinvite other Ministers to attendparticular meetings as required (e.g.,the Secretary of the Department of overseas Trade):
ESSENTIALCOMMODITIESRESERVESBILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 26(38), Con-clusion 11.)(b) That any Minister- concerned with theEssential Commodities Reserves Billshould he a^ked not to make any state-ment which would imply that  in no circumstances would the Government gooutside a purely economic basis for purchases  in foreign countries.
7.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe First Lord of the Admiralty (C.P.-129 (38))reporting that the conversations with representativesof the United States on the subject of the size ofCapital Ships were now concluded;    that the Americans,though preferring no upper limit at all, were preparedto agree to a treaty limit of 45,000 tons, which would,enable them to achieve their objective of 12-gunships;    and. that the Sea Lords recov-mend.ed that theUnited kingdom should, build, ships of 40,000 tons,which would provide well-balanced, ships  carrying 916&quot; guns, and. costing  8.85 millions per ship.   TheAdmiralty therefore proposed the following a.ction,for which Cahinet a.pprova.1 was sought :-&quot;(a) To accept as the treaty limit an uppertonnage limit of 45,000 and of course the already established gun limit of 16&quot;.It must be borne in mind that if we donot accept the American limit by the end.of June, there will be no limit at all  a state of affairs which, though highlyacceptable to the United States, wouldbe most detrimental to our interests:(b) To notify &quot;European Naval Powers that wedo not intend to build for the present-Capital Ships beyond a limit of 40,000&quot;.It was hoped, that, by mea.ns of this self-denyingordinance on our part, a European tonnage limit mightbe produced.The First Lord of the Admiralty explainedhis proposals.      In reply to a question, he saidthat the construction of the new capital ships would-aai &quot;be started bo fore, the end of the present financialye art,     The docks at Singapore and the floating dockat Malta were large enough to accommodate the new capital ships, but the docks at home would have to been larged.      The next step would be to inform thePowers concerned and after that a meeting of the Powerssignatory to the London Naval Treaty would be necessaryin order to give formal sanction to our proposals.
3S0The Cabinet agreed:To approve the action proposed, by theFirst Lord of ine Admiralty inO.P. 129 (3S) and set forth in (a) and(b) above.
8o  The Cabinet again had under consideration a Memorandum   by the Minister of Transport (CP.-121(38)) on the subject of the proposed amendment ofthe Port of London Authority&apos;s Petroleum Bylawswith the object of permitting oil tankers  carryingpetrol to come up the Thames as far as Purfleet,together with a Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence &apos;C.P.-126 (38)), furnished inaccordance with the Conclusion referred to in the margin, setting forth strong objections to thealternative of a. pipeline, whether above ground orbelow, both in peace and war, from a defence pointof view .In the course of a discussion, the Ministerof Transport informed his colleagues of the strong arguments that had been brought againet the proposalto permit oil tankers to come up the Thames as far asPurfleet,     This reach v/as the narrowest part of theriver and he read extracts from communications he hadreceived during the last two months to show how gravewas the danger of collision and fire.The Home Secretary emphasised the importanceof an early decision,,     He pointed out that the matter had been the subject of intensive enquiry over some two years and if an early decision was not reached, theposition, from the point of view of Air RaidPrecautions, would be most difficult.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterinformed the Cabinet that foreigners had spoken to him of the risks taken at Thameshaven, which they described as the finest air target in the world.     It waswell-known in Parliament that the matter had beenunder consideration,
The Lord Privy Seal, as President of the OilBoard, strongly supported an early decision in favour ofthe proposal of the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.One of the greatest difficulties the Oil Board had tcr facewas the provision of underground accommodation, and thePurfleet proposal would provide one-quarter of the amountof petrol it was proposed to place underground.      If thepresent opportunity was lost, we should have to start allover again.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defenceadmitted that, as a result of the enquiry of 1928, itcould not he claimed that there was no question ofadditional risk involved in the proposal, although he felt that a great deal could he said for the view that thepresent method of transport of oil fuel in strings ofbarges was even more dangerous0     The argument in favourof the proposed use of Purfleet could be stated verybriefly, namely;-   If   overground storage was retained,tanks afforded a target to air attack.      If storage wasunderground, they did not.     That in a nutshell was thewhole case.     Of course, if the Government cared to spenda large sum of money they could store 1,500,000 tonsof petrol elsewhere, but they would have to provide asystem of transport to take it to where it was required.Purfleet was the only place which any oil company was ready toconsider.The President of the Board of Trade said that shipping interests were arguing&apos; that the real deterrent tothe Government was economy,      If they were told that Purfleethad been selected for reasons of national defence and thatit was the only suitable place,  they would accept.     Butif they thought it was a question only of expenditure of 1,500,000 of the Government money, they would say thatthis was a small insurance to pay for greater safety.     He
had been wondering whether some regulations could beintroduced which would provide for greater safety forshipsoThe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence saidthat the Liverpool Owners Association had suggested safety regulations which he understood had been accepted.     Tothese, it had been recently added that two tugs should accompany every ship0     If any additional safety regulations could be suggested, he would be glad to get them considered.,     The maximum size of modern tankers was12,000 tons and the ships were divided by steel bulk-headsinto 20-27 compartmentso     Leakage from one compartment,therefore, could not involve more than about 500 tons,which was equivalent to the contents of a barge.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he had not taken much part in these discussions because in 1928 he had appeared as Counsel and defeated the proposal to allowtankers to come up to Purfleeto     He had also discussed the matter with his colleague of that day (Mr. JusticeLangton).     In 1928, the opposition to the proposal had succeeded.      It was always possible to work up an opposition on a matter of this kind and it was inevitable that ship-owners should oppose the proposal.     The danger was not so much from the escape of petrol itself as from aparticular combination of vapour at flash point which,at a given moment, might sweep across the water in a sheetCjC* &quot; -/k.&apos;*f*-i sof flame.     At the 1928 enquiry, however, the-cl-efftftoe* hadnot been an issue and on balance it had been thought better not to allow the proposal and to provide every conditionnecessary for safety,,     In his view, after all that had happened? it seemed desirable to agree to the proposal.The Lord President of the Council supported theChancellor of the Exchequer.     The Government were heavily
engaged in Air Raid Precautions, and it would have a hadeffect in Parliament if it was thought they were leaving the liquid fuel supplies unprotected and were not preparedto take the risk of ships coming up to PurfleetoThe Prime Minister agreed that the decision shouldnot be delayeda     He hopel, however,  that the Minister ofTransport would go into the question of reducing risks from every point of view0The Cabinet agreed;(a) To approve the proposal that oiltankers should in future be allowedto proceed to Purfleet?(b) That the Minister of Transport shouldconfirm thfrjffif. 1Ar^.ws Pr0Pose&amp; Dy the frrLrLondon Ge^l^y^ffnffioa-L withoutinstituting a statutory enquiry andthat he should be authorised to saythat the decision had been taken on grounds of national defence:(c) That the Minister of Transport shouldbe authorised to reply accordingly to the various letters of protest hehad received and that he should be careful to avoid any suggestion thatthe decision had been taken forpurposes of economyj(d) That, in reply to a parliamentary question to be put in the House ofCommons the same afternoon, theMinister for Co-ordination of defence should state that he was aware of the representations which the institute of Fire Engineers had made to theMinister of Transport and that theywere still under consideration.(e) That the Minister of Transport shouldinquire into all the means availablefor reducing the risks involved inthese decisions, including navigationalregulations,  the time and perii-d ofthe tide at which navigation should be permitted, fire precautions, etc.- SO -
ELECTRICITY 9.    The Cabinet had before thera a Memorandum byDISTRIBUTIONBILL. the Minister of Transport f CoP .-125 (38))  containing&amp; a summary of the position renehe^ in the preparation(previous reference: of an^ the negotiations upon the Electricity Distribu-Cabinet 49(57), Con-^        tion Bill, and an appreciation of its politicalelusion 5 .)prospects.    The object of the Bill, which was in process of being drafted, was to carry into effect,with certain modifications already approved by theCabinet (Cabinet 9 (37) 9 and Cabinet 39 (37) 16),the recommendations of the McGowan Committee, of whichthe guiding principle was to concentrate in fewerhands the functions of the 600 separate statutoryundertakings now responsible for the distribution ofelectricity.    In view of the position disclosed inhis Memorandum the Minister sought the further guidanceof his  colleagues,The Cabinet agreed.that a Cabinet Committee proposed as follows the President of the 3oard of Education(in the Chair)The Secretary of State for AireThe Secretary of State for Scotland.The P2?e   dent of the Board of Trade.The Minister of Health.The Minister of Labour.The Minister of Transport.should consider the Minister of Transport&apos;smemorandum CoPo 125 (38) and advise theCabinet as to whether the Bill should be proceeded with in the forthcoming-Session of Parliament, giving special consideration to the advantages and disadvantages of this course from apolitical point of view0
10, The Cabinet had before them a. Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP,-130(38)) asking that the Conclusion referred to in the margin, namely,&quot;That at the forthcoming conversations with the French Government the questionof the exchange of information on thesupply of food, oil and coal in war should be left to the discretion of thePrime Minister and the Foreign Secretary,who would bear in mind the views of their colleagues as presented during the abovedis cuss ion&quot;,should be altered so as to include non-ferrous metalsand minerals, textile ra.w materials and tonnage.All these subjects were dealt with in a letter fromthe Foreign Office to the Committee of Imperial Defencedated 30th March, which was the basis of the cabinet discussion, and the Secretary o^ State thought it wasthrough a misunderstanding that the Cabinet conclusion mentioned only food, oil and coal.The Secretary of State also a.sked for the cancel-lation of the following Conclusion of the Committee ofImperial Defence (330th Meeting, Minute l) , who had.been invited by the Cabinet to consider the generalpolicy to be followed and the machinery to be adopted for carrying out the Conversations&quot;( c)  Tn the first instance, the conversations should not go further than the a.scertain-ment of French requirements by the Depart-ments  concerned, who should then apply tothe Committee of Imperial Defence forfurther instructions&quot;.No such restriction was imposed in the case of the conversations regarding foodstuffs, and. it was not inconformity with assurances given to the french ministers at the meetings on April 28th and 29th.The Departments responsible for the Conversations,however, would of course refer back to the Committeeof Imperial Defence any major questions of principle which might arise,
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairselaborated the points in his memorandum,,      In reply to aquestion, he said it was certainly not his intention todrift back to a position where we gave everything to Franceand nothing to Germany,,The Minister for Go-ordination of Defence, withoutwishing to oppose the proposals of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, said he would like to make quite clearthat the decision to limit the conversations to food, oiland coal was not an accident.     At the previous discussions at the Cabinet and the Committee of Imperial Defence,apprehensions similar to those with which the foreign secretary had already dealt with (as summarised above) hadbeen mentioned.     At the meeting of the Committee ofImperial Defence, to which the Cabinet had referred theproposal for examination in detail, it had been expresslysuggested that the conversations should be limited to food,oil and coal and this had been recorded in the minutes asa conclusion.The Foreign Secretary recalled that,at the verytime when the Committee of Imperial Defence was discussing the subject, he himself had been putting the proposal forsuch conversations to the French and had not limited himself to these three subjects.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence thenturned to the second point raised by the Foreign Secretary,namely, his request for the cancellation of the conclusionof the Committee of Imperial Defence that, in the firstinstance, the conversations should not go further thanthe ascertainment of the French requirements by theDepartments concernedo     He recalled that Sir Henry French,Director of the Food (Defence Flans) Department of the
Board of Trade had described the procedure followed in thediscussion with the French on the subject of food supplies which had been limited   to a list of commodities which France would require from overseas in time of war andtheir transport.     If the conversations on other itemswent further, they would be going beyond the scope of thecorresponding discussions on food supplies.The Foreign Secretary said he did not want togo beyond what had been done in the case of thediscussions on food.The Cabinet agreed:(a) That, in view of the statement madeby the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to French Ministers at theLondon Conversations on April 28th,1938 (CP. 109 (38) enclosure page 20)the conversations between the twoGovernments should be extended so asto cover the following list:-(1) Food.(21 Oil.(3) Coal.(4) Non-ferrous metals andminerals.5) Textile and raw materials.6) Tonnage.(b) That the conversations should be conducted on the same basis as thaton which food discussions are proceeding.

(b) That holidays should begin not in April asproposed by Lord Amulree&apos;s Committee,  andnot before June, which would be very much better from the point of view of the educational year.    It was understood,however, that this point did not ariseimmediately.(c) That in any announcement emphasis shouldbe placed on the discussions with theinterests concerned, which is particularly important from the point of view ofagricultural workers in Scotland.The Cabinet agreed:-To approve the proposals of the Ministerof Labour as set forth in C.P. 128(38) and summarised above.
12. The Prime Minister said that discussionsweretaking place with the German Government on thequestion of the Austrian Loam    He asked theChancellor of the Exchequer to explain the position.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that aninstalment of interest on the Austrian Loan was duethat very day,  and the German Government had intimated that they would not pay.    Sir frederick leith Ross,  after first visiting Rome, had proceeded to Berlin to discuss the matter with the german authorities.    The latter had taken the high line that they had no legal authority to nay the interest.This proposition seemed a dubious one,  seeing that theGerman Government had claimed, to have acquired controlover Austria, not by military occupation but byassent. Their refusal to pay the interest was veryserious to those who held the bonds,  and in additionto H.M-  Government who had guaranteed them.    Theresult of the guarantee was that if the GermanGovernment did not pay, we should have to do so.Sir Frederick Leith Ross had advised on the steps tobe taken,  and in doing so had taken special accountof German psychology.    The course he had proposed wasto terminate payments under the payments Agreement(1934).    This was a very serious weapon to use - averitable steam hammer.    Under the terms of thePayments Agreement a month&apos;s notice had to be given,and payments would cease on the 1st of the month.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he had consulted the prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary andthe President of the Board of Trade, and all had agreed that we ought to free our hands by giving the
requisite notice.    That notice had now been given.    this action put us in a much stronger position during June todiscuss what was to be done.    If nothing could be agreed,we should then set up a Clearing Agreement.    That coursewould be very unwelcome to Germany.    He thoughtthat the German Government would be very anxious to discussthe position during June.    As yet, therefore, we had notbroken off negotiations.    Sir Frederick Leith Ross was toreturn at once for discussions,  and then to go back toGermany,  when conversations would be renewed.    A statement would probably have to be made in the House of Commons andthe House of Lords on the morrow.    The weapon he was usingwas a tremendous one, but the alternative was that we andnot Germany should pay Austria&apos;s debts.    It would beoutrageous if payment of interest on the Austrian debt,which had hitherto been forwarded regularly, ceased now thatGermany had siepped in and seized Austria &apos;s   assets.    We    A    jla-Lccady had a GLuaiiiu Agi&apos;tafcWlellt wUn GexWny. and nun nu.must have one which&apos;eovcvod 0 or many -and Auctr^a.^ A *Clearing Agreement would leave Germany no free exchange, andconsequently would be very unacceptable to her.At this point the Chancellor of the Exchequer readsome fresh information which had reached him while he hadbeen speaking,  and which was to the effect that Sir frederick leith Ross had just telephoned that the Germans were nowready to submit to their Government a proposal that Germany shouldpey the interest onthe Austrian Guaranteed Loans in full if H. M.Government would use their influence with the Bond Holders&apos;Committee to secure an agreed reduction in the service of the&quot;7%    Unguaranteed Loan (despite its prior charge in front of the Guaranteed Loans).    They hoped that we would notdenounce,  and were ready to agree that if a settlement isnot reached by 30th June, we should be free to terminate the

The discussions have notyet been concluded,  and particularly in regard tothe question of Austrian Loans it has not yet beenpossible to reconcile the views of the twodelegations.
