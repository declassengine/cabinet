THE SITUATIONU CENTRAL^EUROPE.Austria andCzecho-Slovakia.(previous reference:Cabinet 13 (38)Conclusion 2.)nR. IS .2o     The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs reported that he had seen Mr, Palairet, theBritish Minister in Vienna, who had informed him that a speech made by Doctor von Seyss-Inquart atLinz had brought Doctor Schuschnigg to announce the plebiscite which, in Mr0 Palairet&apos;s view, would have gone strongly in his favours      The British minister had said^that Doctor von Seyss-Inquart wa-e-now^a sadman9     A strict Catholic by religion, he had not realised the strength of the forces around hirricPassing through Austria, mr Palairet had been impressed, as had been &quot;The Times&quot; correspondent,by the immense and unnecessary number of german troops in Austria *He (the Foreign Secretary) had seen theFrench Ambassador, who had said that he -vould not ask him a question which he knew it would bedifficult for him to answer (British policy towardsCzecho-Slovakia)o      His Excellency had    added,however,  that whatever French Government was in power, its policy towards Czecho-Slovakia would bethe same.     The Foreign Secretary had told the ambassador that he and the Prime Minister werefavourably inclined to the idea of a meeting with french Ministers, but had thought it advisable togive them time to settle inc     The Ambassador had seemed to think that the Government would get amajority when it  met the Chamberc
3.     In continuation of the statementsummarised in the previous item, the foreign secretary said that the French Ambassador had raised the question of Spain and had enquired if anyrumours had reached His Majesty&apos;s Government.      Hehad to reply that he had heard the rumours but had as yet no official information.      That very morning,however, he had received a telegram from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris, despatched late onthe previous evening (No. 83), reporting information received by the French Government to    .e effect thatthe Spanish Government &apos;s forces were being routed;that most of the Spanish Ministers wished to ask for an armistice; and that the Spanish Minister for ForeignAffairs seemed inclined to suggest the advisability of mediation if the French could not send help atonce and that this would, in M. Paul Boncour&apos;opinion, have to be seriously considered if it wererepeated by the Spanish Prime Minister, who had beenin Paris   and left for Barcelona the previous evening.     Mediation, if attempted, should, inM. Paul Boncour&apos;s view     be undertaken by GreatBritain and he begged His Majesty&apos;s Government totake the idea into serious consideration.      if general Franco broke through on the Aragon front,they would be so close to the French frontier as toraise the question as to whether the French shouldnot intervene actively with men and material on theGovernment&apos;s side in order to counter-balanceItalian and German intervention.      M.   Boncour said1^   * he had reason to believe that the Germans werePreviousdeference:3abinet 11 (38)Conclusion &amp;j)
sending to Spain 30,000 regular troops, and he had referred to a rumour, already passed on &quot;by Sir EricPhipps, that help in Spain was the price Herr hitler had paid Signor Mussolini for the betrayal of AusJ;riacThe Foreign Secretary said he had only had the telegram in his hands half an hour and had not had time to consult his office on the subjects     His first reactionwas that if things were going well with Franco, he was unlikely to accept mediation.The Secretary of State for War said the alleged German reinforcement was mentioned in some ofthe morning newspapers.     He thought the Government wouldtake a grave responsibility if they put pressure on theFrench not to intervene if they desired to do so.     Thosewho talked of stopping a great war were already longout of date.     It had begun with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, and since then the Dictator Powers hadbeen manoeuvring to obtain decisive strategic pointswithout fighting for them,      If General Franco obtainedcontrol of the French frontier, it would make a fundamental strategic change in the position.     france would be gravely weakenri if Germans and Italians wereinstalled on the Pyrenees.     The attitude of thePortuguese was very important.     He referred to thecurious reception of the British Mission there.     Theyreported that if we could not supply arms to thePortuguese, they would go to Germany for them.      If wewere not eareful, we should lose another strategic position there, which was all the more important ifGibraltar was threatened,,     The Germans and italians were looking at the works&quot;.d from a military point of view,while we looked at it from a political point of view.
Their outlook was one of war, ours one of peace,,     we ought to delay no longer in putting ourselves on a warfooting so that we too could take part in thisstrategical manoeuvring,,     The French were a realisticpeople and appreciated what was happeninge     Thesuccess of Franco reported to-day had already altered the situation.     We ought to consider very carefully,therefore, &quot;before we discouraged the French fromintervention if they desired it*In     subsequent discussionB it was pointedout that French intervention would make war inevitable.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said he did not under-rate the dangers of the position,and he would not exclude the possibility of danger if germany and Italy tried to establish themselves on theFrench frontiers.     He did not feel at all sure either asto whether,when the Civil War was over, General Francowould want all his foreign allies to leave Spain,There might be a period of civil disturbance during whichhe would be glad of their aidc     He did not, however,see any reason for greater alarm to-day than last week.We were living in an era of power politics.     He thought the main point was to concentrate on the position ofour own armaments and not to encourage the French totake the offensivecIn the course of a short discussion,    itwas suggested that the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence should look into the question of whetherPortuguese requirements for arms could not be met fromBri to. sh manufacture ture,

The Prime Minister agreed that public opinion was moving rapidly in this direction.     He had been impressed by the reference to compulsory militaryservice in a speech by a member of the Front OppositionBench, Mr. Alexander, who had referred to it almostin terms of acceptance of the principle, subject to conditions.     His own view was that the moment had notyet quite arrived for taking a decision on the point,but it must be kept in view.     He himself had beencareful net to use language inconsistent with some form of    compulsion. In the near future,it was probable that announcements would have to bemade as to the Government?s Foreign Policy and defence policy butt at the moment, he himself did not feelclear how far they were to go or in what direction.
.TALY.conversations with..(previous reference:Cabinet 11 (38)Conclusion 5.)15,     In the course of the discussions described in the preceding three items, the Lord Chancellordrew attention to telegram No. 32 frsmParis dated the 14th March, containing information given to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador by the SpanishAmbassador to the effect that at the Fascist GrandCouncil on the 11th March, Signor Mussolini had referred to the British Fleet in the Mediterranean,and this country generally, in contemptuous terms.He (the Lord  Chancellor)    himself feltthat this information was probably incorrect butasked for the opinion of others.The Prime Minister said he had himself beeninclined to dismiss the information as incorrect,if only for the reason that it mentioned a british note about the Mediterranean of ten paragraphs whichit alleged had been handed by the Earl of Perth to signor Mussolini on the previous day, whereas, infact, no such Note had been handedcThe Secretary of State for Foreign affairs recalled that,at the meeting referred to in the margin, he had said he was giving consideration to theoperation of a possible time-table for dealing withthe Spanish difficulty in relation to the conversations with italy      As he had mentioned onthat occasion, he had prepared a Note and had submitted tt to the Cabinet Committee on ForeignPolicy.,     He proposed now to circulate that Note tothe Cabinet together with a telegram to the Earl ofPerth laying before him the new difficulties in thesituation which had arisen owing to the german aggression in Austria and asking his advice.1*m*   *y   ****
ALIEK   RES-Friction.Refugees from austria.((Previous;reference cabinet 27(53), Con-clusion 8).6,     The Home Secretary reported that many persons weree;cpected to seel-: refuge here from Austria,      He feltgreat reluctance in putting another obstacle in the wayof these unfortunate people.     A curious story had reached him (from M. 1,-5), suggesting that the germans were anxious to inundate this country with Jews, witha view to creating a Jewish problem in the United Kingdom.The Cabinet agreed -That the question of refugees from Austriashould be dealt with by the following ministers:The &quot;Tome Secretary (In the Chair)The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (or representative)The President of the Board of Trade(or representative)*The Kinister of Labour,who when dealing with the question would bearin mind the points mentioned by the HomeSecretary regarding,, the importance of adopting as humane an attitude as possible,and at the same time of avoiding thecreation of a Jewish problem in thiscountry.
EIRE:i NEGOTIATIONS[WITH,ft t---7.     The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs reported that before the return of the Ministersrepresenting Eire to Di&quot;blln they had been handedproposals under four heads:Partition.On this point we had offered to make a declarationsetting forth two points, namely, first that we could agree to no change in the situation without the consentof the Government of Northern Ireland, and second, that ifa     change took place, which resulted in a desire on thepart of the Government of Northern Ireland for closer relations, we should not oppose it?Defence.We had said that we were ready to come out of theTreaty ports and to give up our rights under the Treatyof 1921.Finance.We had said that we were re-dy to settle on the basisof a payment of a lump sum of  10 million by Eire, togetherwith a continuation of their present payment of  250,000a year.     We were to abolish the Special Duties on the produce of Eire and they were to withdraw theirdiscriminatory duties0Trade.We had said we were prepared to accept the draft agreement, but we must insist on their going further inthe provision by Eire of special treatment of the produce of Northern Ireland.     Our proposals had included (i)an immediate reduction of the duties on certain specifieditems, (ii) free entry for another list of items at theend of four years.     As the Trade Agreement was to be for
five years, this would guarantee free entry for a year,and it was likely to he continued thereafter0     Mr. de valera on saying goodbye had expressed doubt as to whether he could persuade his Cabinet to accept these proposalsoHe (the Dominion Secretary) had as yet no precise information.He was under the impression, however, that Mr. de valera and at least two out of his three colleagties on the delegation had pressed these proposals on the Governmentof Eire, but as they were not themselves satisfied on the partition issue, they might not have urged them very strongly.     He rather expected, therefore, that they would refuse the special concessions to Northern Ireland.     Hethought it v/as true that from a political point of view theGovernment of Eire would not be able to get themaccepted. He did not think that they would reject theproposals outright0     It was more probable that they were working out counter proposals, including concessions to northern Ireland, wrapped up in the form of concessions tothe United Kingdom.     There was nothing to be done until their replies and/or counter proposals were received./^   if nothing could be obtained for/Northern Ireland, :*.t would benecessary to realise that the negotiations had broken down,perhaps for a long timecThe Prime Minister reported that the Prime Ministerof Northern Ireland was arriving in London on Friday, andhad stated that he was coming to help and not to hinder,,-10-fi^J- ^eJL co+uAoL ^cazc^ AvjL^ &amp;cCol
u8*     The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs on the Questionof the Transfer to the Union of South Africa of the Govern-ment of the High Commission Territories:C.P.-28 (38), to which were attached copiesof correspondence with General Ilertsogand the draft of a Joint Statement:CP.-61 (38), outlining further developmentshg))2.       since the question was discussed by the Cabineton the 16th February (Cabinet 5 (38), Conclusion 8)*The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs said hewould not weary the Cabinet with a repetition of the storyof the long dispute with General Kertzog about the SouthAfrican Territories which had arisen out of a charge onthe General&apos;s part that we were not implementing the policyagreed between him and Mr. J,H. Thomas in 1935.     This charge was not well--faunded.      In a Paper he had circulated last july he had mentioned three essential points-- - The first two of these were:(a) to restore confidence in our good faith.     That, tosome extent, had been done by correspondence.(b) to devise the next steps in a policy of constructiveco-operation.In this latter connection General liertzog had madevarious suggestions which had been rejected.     There were two, however,- in which he himself had agreed, namely thatthere should be a joint advisory conference of officials to devise economic measures in respect of the Territories, andthat the Union Government should prepare certain Documents,setting forth what would happen if the Union of SouthAfrica took over the Territories.     Such Documents   wouldbe very useful for clearing the air, as there was much
confusion both in South Africa and here as to what wouldbe the position.      It had been suggested that the Governmentof the Union of South Africa should prepare liemoranda onthis point and that we should give facilities for bringing them to the notice f the natives.     lie recalled that atthe Meeting referred to in the margin, he had asked theCabinet to agree to a joint statement which would re-state the pledges and announce the terms of agreement on future policy.     This he had proposed with a view to disposing of various rumours.     Before committing themselves, however,to the statement the Cabinet had wished to see the documents which were to be prepared by the Govern...ent of theUnion.     Those Documents were to be found in the appendicesto his Memorandum.     he did not think it necessary to repeat the comments contained in the Memorandum before theCabinet (CP. 61(38)).     v&quot;he proposed time-table in respectof the Documents was as follows:(i) early publication of the joint statement;(ii) a later publication of the Documents.These latter, of course, were documents produced by the union for which we were not in any way responsible.     We would,however, give facilities for the communication of the documents to the native chiefs as described at an earliermeeting.     Certain eoejie^tijans woold haue      be sa&amp;e, however,in the l^ttr^h Document and/the Fifth Document woulc nnt &quot;be given^Feri-^to the native chiefs0      After receiving the first four Documents the native chiefs would be allowed to take them away for study, but the Resident Commissioners wouldgive the Chiefs an opportunity to meet a representative ofthe Union of South Africa and to ask him questions.
The Resident Commissioners, who werenBii of considerable experience, would have to make it clear that they wereneither commending nor opposing the proposals..     We werepledged under the ITertzog-Thomas agreement, to which he paid tribute, not to discourage the natives, but wehad given no undertaking to urge them to accept thepolic3r of transfer.      In reply to a question he said thatif the chiefs should   want to know the position as to matters that were not in the Document, such as the factthat natives of the Union of South Africa were not allowedto undertake any skilled trade, the Resident commissioner would suggest that they should put the question to arepresentative of the Union of South Africa.     He agreedthat the matter was not without difficulties, but therewas a strong demand for the publication of these Documentseven from persosn who were opposed to the transfer.The Secretary of State for the Colonies supported the programme of the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs, but pointed out that the publication of a document on the lines of the Memorandum on the native policy of the Government of the Union of South Africa(CP. 61(38) Document S) would produce a violent rejoinderboth here and in South Africa.      It was a purely propagan-dist Document and would have wide and unfortunate reactionsthroughout British Africa.      lie hoped that we should on no account agree to any Document referring to nativematters outside the Union.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that Xc.     .     thin DnffliTiinnf v,&apos;Q,r. nnt.  int,nnrinri  -Pnri n nmmiiw j e a %3 tla^-/^natives.

V/e were under no commitment or obligation of any kindrelating thereto. Although the Document was open tomany objections it did in fact show an advance in certainthe Union.     lie had never had in mind to agree to this document as it stood.     Even though ho objootod teethepublication of this Document it was possible that theGovernment of the Union might insist on publishing itan their own responsibility as a propaganda Document.After some further discussion the Cabinet agreed -(a) To approve the issue of the proposed joint statement (CP. 28 (33) Appendix S.), andthat the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs should be authorised to agreeto the desire of the Union Government toissue it forthwith.(b) To take note of the Documents contained in cp. 61 (38) Appendix II and markedDocument A,   Document B, Document C andDocument D.(c) To invite the attention of the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs to the remarksof the Secretary of state for the Colonies(d) To approve paragraph 7 of CP. 61 (38), inwhich the Secretary of State for DominionAffaix^s recommended that the Cabinet should accept, without pressing for any additions,the following assurances which the Governmentof the Union of South Africa have includedin Document A to provide an alternativesecurity to Section 25 of the Schedule ofthe South Africa Act, (providing forreservation of all Bills to amend or alter the provision of the Schedule of the Act forthe signification     of the King&apos;s pleasure),viz:respects onthe orevious attitude of the Government of

The Minister for Go-ordination of Defencerecalled the decision of the Cabinet at the meeting referred to in the margin in favour of the constructionof the Baghdad-Haifa Road.    He reminded his colleagues that the financial aspects were to be considered bythe Treasury in conjunction with the Departmentsconcerned, and that the priority to be assigned to theroad was to be decided in connection with a general review which he was shortly to present.    The Secretaryof State for War had impressed udoii him that if theroad was to be finished before 1940, it would have tobe begun next June in order that it might be startedbefore the rainy season and had asked for an early decision.    In view of the high importance attached tothe road by his colleagues, he had replied that hewas prepared to make a recommendation to the Cabinetthat it should be proceeded with forthwith.    shortly before coming to the meeting he had learnt that theTreasury had decided to charge the cost of the road tothe Colonial Office Votes, but that the expenditure would have to be deducted from the amounts availableto the Defence Departments.    By this he understoodthat the Defence Departments would have to confer asto the quota which each was to bear.    That decision,he pointed out, was hardly consistent with the factthat the Cabinet&apos;s approval had been based on theimportance of the road &quot;not only for the strategicalreasons set forth in the Report before the Committeeof Imperial Defence, but as a great Imperial projectcalculated to consolidate and strengthen our positionthroughout the Middle East,  and to improve not only
our military, but also our commercial communicationsit4   *The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed outthat the road would never have been approved, butfor the military arguments in its favour.    The earlierand less ambitious provision had been based on grounds of defence.    The idea of putting the road on theColonial Vote was solely as a camouflage.    in substance the Cabinet had given their decision,because they regarded the road as a mo&quot;,t urgentmatter of defence expenditure.    He realised thedifficulties of the Defence Departments, but hecould not see how logically the road could escape the operation of the earlier decision as to theamounts available for defence.The Secretary of State for War recalled that the first proposal was for a road to be made by awhich wascommercial company/in negotiation with the ColonialOffice.    No agreement had been reached, however,  andthen it had been discussed in its military aspects.Finally, however, it had been lifted out from itspurely military aspects into the form of a greatImperial project.After a short discussion the cabinet agreed:-That . 100? 000 towards the e-gsjrroad should be borne^jDnr-Hrh^ColonialOffice Votes^^burtr^That the remainder of the-errgt should be reimbursed bythe^Def.enco Departments-.(b) TUt fi, ;L n .,L

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (CP.-64 (38))  circulatingthe Army and Air Force (Annual) Bill, with a prefatorymemorandum explaining the amendments of the Army Actand Air Force Act.   The Bill must receive the royal assent by the 30th April, but, owing to the incidence of Easter, it would probably be necessary for it to be passed by both Houses before the adjournment.   TheSecretary of Sta-te therefore desired to circulate it immediately after its First Reading, which followedautomatically on the conclusion of the Report stage ofVote A of the Service Departments&apos; Estimates.The Secretary of State for War mentioned thathe was talcing power in the Bill to transfer men fromline unit to another in connection with long service.The Cabinet agreed:-(a) To approve the proposals    of the Secretaryof State for War (CP. 64(38)) assummarized above.(b) To approve the power it was proposed totake to transfer men from one unit toanother in connection with the long serviceproposals of the War Office.

The Cabinet had before them a Note by theMinister of Health (on behalf of the President of thePoard. of Trade) (C.P.-60 (38))  circulating a Memo-randum by the Secretary for Mines on the question ofan enquiry into costs and profits margins in thedistribution o^ coal,  coke and manufactured, fuel  a matter which had been pressed in Parliament on anumber of recent occasions.   At the end of his Memo-randum the Secretary -for Mines stated that he felt,in the circumstances he outlined, that there was no option but to announce that a Committee would, be setup for the purpose, in spite of the obvious risks which might emerge from the Report of such an enquiry.and. suggested, the following Terms of Reference:-&quot;To enquire into the organisation and methods of distribution of coal, cokeand manufactured fuel;    to investigate the various items which go to make upthe differences between the pricesreceived by the producers and. thosepaid, by the consumers, and to make recommendations&quot;.In the dourse of the discussion the lord privy Seal said that he agreed to the proposal on theunderstanding that the Cabinet regarded the matter as one of importance on which they meant business.The Cabinet agreed:-To approve the proposal of the Presidentof the Board of Trade for the appointment ofa Committee with the above Terms of Reference.

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary (C.P.-62 (38)) stating that theBakehouses Bill (promoted, by the Labour Party and.proposing to prohibit night-work in bakehouses),which, against Government advice, had been accordeda Second Reading in the House of Commons on 18thFebruary, would shortly be considered in StandingCommittee and that the Government attitude had tobe decided.
