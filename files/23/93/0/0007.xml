I      v:TRE 2. The Cabinet had under consiteration a Memo-frON^IHMATTONOP AGREEMENTS)randum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs(H.A.-11 ^38))  covering the draft Eire (Confirmation of(previous Agreements) Bill, the main object of which was to reference:Cabinet 19      confirm and give effect to the Agreements between the(38), Con-clusion 6.)    Governments of the united kingdom and Eire, which hadER.5&quot;^(^)^heen signed on the same day:    together with the following conclusions reached by the Committee of Home affairs thereon (H.A.C. 6th Conclusions (38)):-&quot;(l) To reserve for the approval of theCabinet the inclusion in the Bill,as proposed by the Irish situation committee, of the provisions con-tained in Clause 1 for the use infuture of the term &apos;Eire&apos;  in sub-stitution for the expression &apos;theIrish Free State&apos;&apos;:(2) Subject to Conclusion (l), to recommend the Cabinet to approve the Eire (Con-firma+ion of Agreements) Bill in theform of the draft attached to H.A.-11viz., two verbal (38), subject to the two points notedchanges in the Bill       above*, an^ subject also to any draftingsuggested in the or other minor alterations that may beComi?3itt ee&apos;s dis- found necessary or desirable, and tocushion, authorise the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs to arrange for theintroduction of the Bill in the Houseof Commons on Wednesday, April 27th,1938.&quot;The Lord Chancellor, referring to the two verbalohanges in the Bill suggested in the discussion at theCommittee of Home Affairs, said that he himself hadbeen persuaded that the addition of the word &quot;henceforth&quot;in line 5 of Clause 1 was unnecessary and he had with-drawn the proposal.    ^h.e second point, namely, as tothe use of the term &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited kingdom&quot;, in Clause 2 (3)  (a), and. of the term&quot;the Government of the United kingdom&quot; in Clause 3 (4),had been surmounted (as explained in Conclusion (b)below) .He warned the Cabinet, however, that the main political difficulties would arise owing to the
cancellation of Clause 7 (b) of the Articles ofAgreement of the 6th December, 1921.    In doing this we were striking out the obligation resting on Eireunder the old Agreement to allow us to use their ports in time of war.   That was something that, if they werereasonable people, they ought to    ask   us to do.The Prime Minister said that all members of theCabinet woul^ agree in principle that it was unfortunate-nate to have to cancel this Clause.    It was, however,another case of facing realities.   We could not securethe cordial co-operation of Eire in the matter of the ports without this  concession.     All that would havebeen left to us, therefore, would have been in theevent of war to try an^ enforce out- rights .   Byabandoning what amounted to a paper right we had secured a. reasonable prospect of obtaining theadvantages of the co-operation of the Government and people of Eire in the defence of the ports.    Originallyhe ha.&apos;1 hoped to obtain some quid pro quo, and everyeffort had been made in this direction.    This, however,had proved impossible, and the negotiators had. felt itnecessary to content themselves with the best theycould get.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs agreed with the Prime Minister that in principle we ought to have retained the right to use the ports,but. it. had not been practicable.    On balance there wasa better prospect of getting what we wanted by abandon-ing our legal rights than by insisting on them.He agreed, that that would be the main ground for attackon the Bill.
The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the inclusion in the Bill,as proposed by the Irish situation committee, of the provisions containedin Clause 1 for the use in future ofthe term &quot;&quot;Eire&quot; in substitution forthe expression &quot;the Irish Free State&quot;:(b) To approve the amendment of Clause 2(3) (a)to read as follows:-&quot;(a) the sum payable in accordancewith the provisions of Article 1of the said agreement shall, as and when received, be paid intothe Exchequer:&quot;(c) That the expression &quot;the Governmentof the United Kingdom&quot; in Clause 3 (4)should remain as in the draft attachedto H.A.-11 (38):(d) Subject to the above Conclusions andto any drafting or other minor alter-ations that m*y be found necessary or desirable, to approve the &quot;Eire(Confirmation of Agreements) Billin the form of the draft attached toHcA,-ll (38), and to authorise theSecretary of State for Dominion affairs to arrange for the introduction of theBill in the House of Commons onWednesday, April 27th, 1938:( e)  mo congratulate the Secretary of Statefor &quot;Dominion Affairs on the successful outcome of his prolonged an^ untiringefforts to secure an Agreement.2, ;Vhiteh*ll Gardens, S.W.1.25th April, 1938.
