1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that he had already circulated all the informa-tion that had arrived since the Meeting of the Cabineton Sunday afternoon.The German Press were rather resentful of thesuggestion that the restraint of the German governments had been dictated by British end French pressure.Credit had been given to His Majesty&apos;s Government inour own Pres? for firmness, and the French people in particular were grateful to us.    Although thesuggestion that the present  corner had been turnedowing to British ^ir^ness might have a  certain valueinternally, he had told th^ Press that the last thinghe desired was that this should be said, and that  itwould be much more helpful if they coul^ say that thepresent slight  detente was due to the helpfulness ofall the nations concerned.   He had also asked sir Eric Phipps to suggest to the French ForeignMinister that he should try to get the French press to take the same line.   As suggested at the Cahinet,he himself had seen representatives of the british press on Sunday evening, and he thought that theBritish Press had reacted well on Monday morning.He had informed the German Ambassador of what he had done, but had added that he was disappointed thatthe German Press was not behaving so well, and had warned him. that, this u-ould be resented here,    ^heAmbassador had been rather apologetic about theGerman Press, and had suggested that the Germans,after exercising so much restraint, rather resentedthe suggestion that the Czechs had been equallyrestrained:-   The Ambassador had admitted, however,that the statement ma.de in the British Parliament on
this issue had been flawless, and he had undertaken,at the Foreign Secretary&apos; s request, to telegraph to dr. Goebbels reminding him that he had. told Lord.Halifax that he wanted above all things friendship with this  country and asking him to co-operate.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs then read to the Cabinet &quot;elegra- No.80, of the 24th May,from Prague, in which the -ritish Minister had reported that the Czechoslovak President o^ theCouncil had had a two hours1   conversation on theprevious evening with Herr Henlein and that the latter had promised to formulate his demands in writing bythe end of the week.    That gave the impression thatthe negotiations would be kept on the basis of a somewhat lower temperature for some time.    He had,as yet, no news of the demobilisation of the Czecho-slovak troops, though the French Government were pressing that something should be done.   He hadreceived -e-rom the -Var Office an explanation of the discrepancy between the information from the military attache and that issued in a Czechoslovak officialCommuniou6 as to the number of Classes  called up inthat  country.    The number of reservists in any one class was 7^,000.    193 7 Class, being a lean year,numbered only 69,000, and the 193^ Class about 97,000.&quot;&quot;he Czechoslovak Government had therefore called, up from these two Classes a number approximately equiva-lent to one average Class,    &quot;his explained the variousreferences by M. Bonnet and the German State Secretaryto the calling up of two Classes.   The total numberof men called up was a^out 176,000 men, some of whomserved in a semi-civilian capacity, e.g., air raidwardens,    &quot;he reports of the visits paid, by Military
Attaches in Berlin to the Czechoslovak frontier,which had been referred to at the previous Meeting,as well as reports of a visit by the Attache&apos; of theUnited States of America,  indicated no great activity on the German side of the frontier-The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,having dealt as above with, the immediate situationconcerning Czechoslovakia., gave the Cabinet a preliminary summary of the way his mind was working on future policy.    If we had turned the first cornersuccessfully, we ought already to be getting ready for the second .   He recalled that the French Govern-ment were constantly talking of the dilemma in whichthey were placed between the risk of war and dishonour.The British view was that  a. war would be an unprofit-able one, and that was the French view also.   he recalled that the French engagement had been enteredinto many ye^rs ago in totally different circumstances,when Germany was still disarmed, and they had, so to speak, a. back door approach to Germany through the rhineland.    It was desirable, therefore, if possible,to obtain a release for the French from their obliga-tion and its  contingent  consequences,    If the present negotiations went well and a permanent settlement wasreached,  cad it quaestio.   We could hardly dare hope,however, for that, and it was quite possible that,things might become ugly again.    It was true that a firm attitude on our part might  conceivably be successful again, but if a really bad incidentoccurred and a. number of lives were lost, there wasthe possibility of our finding ourselves in trouble.
He had been considering how the whole question could he liquidated .   He did. not think it was possible forI His Majesty&apos;s Government to pledge themselves tosupport any particular solution of the Sudeten question in Czechoslovakia;    they were not equipped with thenecessary knowledge:    and, in addition, such a pledgewould, bring us very near to a military commitment.Consequently, if at. some point in the negotiations astrong demand should he made for a. plebiscite, he doubted if it  could veil be resisted with sufficient support from public opinion here.   On the other hand,he also felt that for Dr. Benes to concede a plebis-cite under German duress would, be very damaging to him.He (the Secretary of State) had been wondering, there-fore, as to whether at some point Dr. Benes might notbe well advised to make the best offer he could tothe Sudeten Deutsch, but to add that he realised thatthe offer was no use if Large blocks of the citizens of the country were to remain discontented, and,consequently, that he would be willing to put to them the question as to whether they would prefer thesettlement he offered, or the*\Ans chluss&quot; with Germany.A second point which he thought was worthy of consideration was as to whether Dr. Benes might notwork for a. provisional settlement for five years, witha plebiscite at the end.    But, as Sir John Simon had pointed out in hi-^ Report on India, that kind of temporary settlement was apt to lead to agitation.Continuing, the Foreign Secretary said that he did not feel that we could ask the French, the Czecho-slovak or Russian Governments to denounce theirAlliances;    he would, however, like to see the Czecho-slovak State move into a. position of neutrality which,
like the neutrality of Switzerland, would he witnessedby the big nations concerned.   Under such a system the Alliances would automat!cally disappear.The Secretary of State added that he was sendingMr Strang, of the Foreign Office, to Prague that veryday to obtain some idea of the atmosphere in that city.Mr Strang was to go on to Berlin, where he would spend the second day, returning to London on Friday.    Inthe meantime the Foreign Office would be examining the ideas o^ a plebiscite and o** a system of neutral-ity .   He asked for no decision, but he had wished theCabinet to know the lines on which he wa.s working.Tn the course of a short discussion the plan ofCzechoslovak neutrality, accompanied perhaps by aCantonal system as in Switzerland, was  commended.A plebiscite w*s felt to offer gree.ter difficulties.The Prime Minister appreciated the fact that,theForeign Secretary was thinking on these lines.    Hisown mind had moved in the same direction.   What hehad been thinking of was that the Sudeten Deutschshould regain in Czechoslovakia, but a contented,people.    If the Germans  could be satisfied with the czechoslovak State from the point of view of their foreign policy, it might be possible.to get a. settle-^ent in Europe.   An indication that Herr Hitler might accept something of the kind was to be found in the account, of his interview with the Age Kha.n.   He hoped,therefore, that the Foreign Secretary would follow upthe idea.Tn reply to a question as to whether the Frenchthemselves had. any idea as to how to escape from theirdilemma, the Foreign Secretary said that they had communicated nothing to him.   He thought that M *Bonnet
would be glad of any suggestions.   He would like towork on the subject during the present week, and,after Mr Strang&apos;s return, to consult the Prime minister as to the next move.The Chancellor of the Exchequer paid a. tribute to the handling of the Czechoslovak situation by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs .   He pointed,out, however, tha.t we were living in a. shifting situa-tion, which could not endure long unless somethingwas done.   He suggested, therefore, that it wasnecessary to impress on Dr. Eenes the importance of early action.mhe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed.He said, that the same afternoon he had arranged to seethe Czechoslovak Minister, who was leaving for Praguetomorrow.   He had information which led. him to thinkthat the Minister would be helped if he himselfpressed him rather stilly to represent to the Czecho-slova-k Government that we had aided them in thepresent difficulty, but that this made it all themore important that they should push   on with apermanent settlement.-6-
SPAIN.2 .The Secretary o-f State for Foreign affairs said that the Non-intervention Committee would meeton the morrow.    mhe Earl of Plymouth (Chairman) was rather more hopeful tha.n on earlier occasions .   he himself had pressed the principal Governments repre-sented on the Committee to send helpful instructionsto London.   He ha.d learned from the Italian ambassador on the previous evening that the Italian Governmenthad decided to p^ess on with non-intervention.    Theydid not think, however, that General Franco was readyto accept mediation.    The Foreign Secretary had asked if it would do any harm if His Ma.majesty&apos;s Governmentcame into the open in favour of int oyvontion, if only with a view to the education of public opinion.Count Grandi had replied that that would do no harm.He had added, that the German representative was also likely to be helpful at the Hon-Intervention Committee.The Foreign Secretary had. reason to believe that theFrench Ambass8.dor also was likely to be helpful.
JAMAICA. 3. The Secretary of State for the Colonies madea s?nort statement about the present troubles in(Previouslle^erence: Jamaica. mhey had started from a strike in the docks.Cabinet 60(2?).  Con-      Unruly elements had  tried  tn  evtend  this  tn a  ofinfiralelusion 5 .)strike had not been countenanced by the responsible labourleaders in the Island, and the trouble was fomentedby less responsible people. . The control of or.der had got beyond the powers of the Police, and/special constables had been enlisted.   According to the latest reports the Military and the Police had the situationin hand, but a Cruiser had been ordered to proceed tothe Island -from Bermuda as an extra precaution.Official reports wei-e to the effect that two personshad been killed, but it was stated in the Press thata third had died.    mhe ostensible object of thestrike was an all-round increase in wages, although a Commission had been appointed Hy the Government toexamine this very question and was due to report inthe near future.   This was one of a. series of recentoutbreaks in the Vest Indies, and he had no doubt-that ultimately it was due to economic causes.    Wehad done a good, deal for the Island, but nevertheless there were causes for discontent.    In addition, therewas a good deal of racial feeling between coloured,and white people, which ha^ %een much stimulated by events in Abyssinia, and had now become serious.mhe employers had not always handled their labourvery wisely.   He thought it would be necessary to study this problem in its fundamentals.    there wasjrrfcery- to U-e. a. demand for a Royal Commission,, butthere was no object,in appointing a Royal Commissionunless,.^eir efforts
He did not think that the presenttroubles were mixed up with Constitutional questions,though there was a Constitutional problem in Jamaica.He felt it would be necessary to face the dilemma asto whether some remedy for the economic facts of thesituation could he found or whether matters would haveto he left as at present
4.    The Cabinet had before them a Most secret memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence (CP.-122 (38))  covering a Report by theChiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (CCS .-727)  contain-inp recommendations on the general form and scopeof the proposed Staff Conversations with Prance andBelgium.    Tn his Memorandum the Minister statedthat it had not been found possible to refer theReport to the Committee of Imperial Defence priorto the present Meeting.    It had. therefore been circulated direct to the Cabinet as the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs was anxious to proceedwith the matter with reasonable despatch.In the course of the discussion, apprehensionswere expressed as to the suggestion in paragraph 8   ofthe Report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee thatthe scope of Naval Conversations should embrace an exchange of information with regard to -&quot;(a) Proposed dispositions for war.&quot;It was recalled that in 1914 so far as there was amoral commitment arising out of the staff conversations that had taken place in previous years,it arose not so much out of the Military Conversationsas out of the Naval Conversations, which had ledto a concentration of French Naval forces in theMediterranean,     This had resulted in an exposureof the French northern coast unless they could count oBritish Naval co-operation.It was pointed out, however, that NavalConversations could hardly take place without an exchange of information with regard to the proposeddispositions for war.     This had been the principalobjection to having Nj.val Conversations, but once this had been agreed to, it was almost impossible to
exclude that topic.The main discussion, however, was on the questionof whether the Report made it sufficiently -jlear thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government were nor, committed to send eventwo Divisions on the outbreak of war0     It was urgedthat it ought to be made quite clear to the french military authorities that their plans must be made quiteindependently of the assumption of even this amount ofco-operation.      In this connection, it was pointed outthat the Chiefs of Staff in their Report had quoted thefollowing remarks by Lord Halifax that -&quot;Subject to a full appreciation of Mr. Chamberlainsstatement on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Goverimientto the effect that they could not be under any definite commitment to send even two divisions to France on the outbreak of war 0. *. * c i!The Cabinet were reminded, however,  that duringthe Conversations, French Ministers had pressed the PrimeMinister and the Foreign Secretary very hard to go further and that it would be as well,  therefore,  to make quite clear in the Military Conversations that no definite commitmenthad been entered into to send even two Divisions,,The Cabinet were also reminded that the discussions would be on a purely technical basis;    that they were wholly hypothetical and dependent on an ultima.te politicaldecision.     As the Chiefs of Staff had made clear that&quot;the scope of the Conversations should only cover themovement up to and including&apos; the assembly area&quot;   and that&quot;there should be no question of arranging concentrationareas&quot;, it was bound, at that point, to become clear thatthe French would have to make their initial plans on theassumption that at the outset of war they must occupy thewhole of their front.
The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the following conclusionof the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee:-&quot;(i) We assume that the medium of theNaval, Army and Air conversations with the French will be throughService Attaches and we recommendthat our representatives in Parisshould be instructed to resist any attempt on the part of theFrench to raise the contacts toa higher level, at any rate inthe early stages.     So far as theNavy is concerned we recommendthat at no stage should the conversations reach the level onour side of higher than directors of Admiralty Divisions.&quot;(b) That with regard to the ArmyConversations -(i) Cur Military Attache should be instructed to make clear that only two Divisions could beavailable at the outset of war for despatch to the Continent if circumstances elsewhere permitted;that it had already been made clear, on the political side,that no commitment to send them could be taken in advance;   butthat he was prepared to enter on discussions on the hypothesis that such a decision might betaken0      If the French were toask for more Divisions, he should state   that at the outset of thewar no more   Divisions would beready, and that before re-inforcements could be sent, therewould be plenty of time todiscuss the detailed arrangements.(ii) That it would be permissible to enlarge the usefulness of the conversations by includingadministrative reconnaissancesat the ports of disembarkationby a few junior staff officers inplain clotht 30(c) Subject to the above decision, to approve the scope of the Naval and army Conversations with the french as outlined in paragraphs 7-10 and17-19 of the Report of the Chiefs ofStaff Sub-Committee attached to cp. 122  (38).
(&amp;)   To approve the following recommendation of the Chiefs ofStaff Sub-Committees--&quot; (iv) We recommend that contacts with the Belgians, over and above those already existing between our military Attache in Brussels-and the Belgian General staff should be confined toconversations on the Attachelevel on certain airquestions summarised inparagraph 210     We submit that if conversations withthe Belgians on the abovelimited scale are authorised,it should be possible withtruth to say in any public statement by His Majesty&apos;ministers that&quot;normal contacts withthe Belgian MilitaryAuthorities are being maintained with theService Attaches&quot;. &quot;(e) To approve the following recommendation of the Chiefs ofStaff Sub-Committee%-&quot;(v)   We consider that there wouldbe no advantage, from themilitary point of view, inentering into triangularconversations with theFrench and Belgians so long-as the scope of the conversations is kept withinthe limits recommended inthis Report., &quot;(f) That the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence should call theattention of the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee to the following passage in paragraph 19 of theirReport&quot;If, on the other hand,  the advanced air striking forceand the field force have to operate in different theatres,additional units must be formed for which no provision existsat presento&quot;The Minister should invite them toconsider what action should betaken to correct this deficiencyto which the representatives ofthe French General Staff arelikely to call attention,,
50     The Cabinet had before them a Note by theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence (CP. 119 (38))describing the consideration that had been given bythe Committee of Imperial Defence to the subject ofGerman civil aviation penetration in the Near and far East since the Meeting referred to in the margin.The Minister attached to his Note a copy of a joint memorandum by the Secretary of State for India andthe Secretary of State for Air (C.I.D. Paper No.l429-B)fand an extract from the 322nd Meeting of the Committeeof Imperial Defence  (Minute 7).The Minister for Co-ordination of Defenceintroduced the subject.The Secretary of State for India made a short statement, in the course of which he proposed an amendment to conclusion (c).In the course of a short discussion, it wassuggested that the present position resulted from thefact that the Government of India had not developedits air routes.The Prime Minister said that that was alarger question which, if raised, would have to bebrought up as a separate issueeAfter a short discussion, the Cabinet agreed:To approve the following conclusionsof the Committee of Imperial Defence(conclusion (c) of which has been slightlyamended as in the passage underlined below)(a)   That for the reasons stated in theJoint Memorandum by the secretaries of State for India and Air(CoIoD. Paper No.l4S9-B) and inthese Minutes, it would now be bothimpracticable and impolitic toattempt to prevent the Germansestablishing an air line to Kabul,permission for which they had obtained from the Afghan Government.
That it would, on balance, be toour advantage to grant the Germanethe transit facilities for whichthey were asking on the usual routeacross India and Burma for an AirService to the Par East.That the Secretary of State for air should accordingly be invited toinform the Germans in reply totheir official application of the12th March, 1938, that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would beprepared to grant the facilitiesfor which they asked on theunderstanding that this concessioncarried with it a definiteengagement on the part of theGerman Government to grantreciprocal facilities when requiredfor the development of British air services in other quarters, and, inparticular to give any co-operationthat they are in a position to give in the matter of reciprocalfacilities between imperial airways and Eurasia in China.To invite the Secretary of Statefor India to inform the Governmentof India in the sense of paragraphs (a) to (c) above
kjjj PROGRAMME. 6,     The Secretary of State for Air informed the acceleration of      Cabinet that further communications from the MissionJjission to the sent to the United States of America and Canada hadami ted States ofKmerica. resulted in clearing up several of the points that had been raised at the last meeting of the Cabinet.bpeviousReference: For example, guarantees had been given for theCabinet 24 (38jConclusion 15.)       delivery of 27 Lockheed machines before the31st December, 1938, and of 15 a month thereafter,exclusive of the time required in this country forthe fitting of turrets, bomb-racks, etc.     It wasalso now established that the aircraft could ondelivery in this country be modified to take Britishbomb-racks so as to carry British bombs.      If we didnot purchase these aircraft ourselves, it was almost certain that the Australians would wish to do so and if a start was once made with the direct saleof American aircraft to Australia, it would bedifficult to recover the market for this country.In the case of training types of aircraft, thefollowing guaranteed delivery dates had been obtained by the Mission: -45 before 31st December, 1938,20 in January, 1939,30 in February, 1939,35 a month thereafter,with the completion of the order by31st May, 1939oAfter consulting the Prime Minister, hehad decided to invite the two American companies concerned to send representatives to London todiscuss details and thay were sailing from Americathat very day.     He had reached the conclusion on a review of all the circumstances that this opportunityought not to be lost and that we must have these machines.     He was also impressed by the possibilitiesof erecting a factory in CanadaB
The Secretary of State for Foreign. Affairs saidthat the idea of purchasing American machines with itsimplication that America was behind us had had a usefuleffect in Germany,     There would be a certain contraryeffect if we dropped the proposal,.The President of the Board of Trade, recallingwhat he had said at the previous meeting about the balanceof trade, said that,if these aircraft were to be purchased,it would be a great advantage if it could be done quickly.This might help in the American Trade Negotiations.The Minister of Labour warned the Cabinet thatthe purchase v/ould be unpopular in some districts.The Secretary of State for Air pointed out thatthe aircraft industry had as many orders as it could fulfil.In the course of the discussion, the cabinet were reminded that, as the representatives of the Americanmanufacturing companies were only starting from the UnitedStates to-day, they could not arrive in time for thematter to be submitted to the Cabinet at their next regular weekly meeting.     That would be followed by the whitsun Recess.     It was suggested, therefore, thatarrangements should be made for delegating the authorityfor taking a decision.The Cabinet agreed:That authority to take a decision onbehalf of the Cabinet should be delegated to the Prime Minister, theChancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for Air.
7.    In pursuance of the Conclusion mentioned inthe margin, the Cabinet had. before them a Memorandumby the President of the Board of Trade (CP.-120(38)) on the subject of the re-organisation o^ theCotton Industry, in which he described a deadlockthat had arisen in negotiations with certain sectionsof the industry.    The President sought the authorityof his colleagues to proceed with the drafting of aBill, to be published as a basis of discussion, onthe general lines of the revised proposals of theJoint Committee of Cotton Trade Organisations (a copyof which he attached to his Memorandum), modifiedwherever necessary in order to get the maximum ofagreement,   He proposed, however, to ma.ke a further effort to induce the different sections of the industryto try to reach some greater measure of agreement,as the result o^ such discussions should at leastassist him in producing a. Pill that would  command aswide a. measure of support as it was possible to obtain.The President of the Board of Trade made afull statement to the Cabinet on the subject, in thecourse of which he emphasised the opposition thatwould be created either by accepting or rejecting- thescheme, and pointed out that unless the Governmentwere prepared to take some further step, the schemewas bound to fail and the responsibility would beplaced on the Government,     The only way he could seewas to announce that the Government were prepared toproceed with the drafting of a Bill based on thegeneral lines of the proposals of the Joint Committee;to state that, in the absence of an agreement, theywere not accepting all the details:   but that they wereprepared to propose some modifications,.     He had seen the opponents of the Bill and he had thought it was not
impossible to reach agreement on the basis of somerather less elaborate and. widespread arrangement, andto achieve this he proposed to use the occasion of the drafting of the Bill to try, through the instrumentalityof a neutral Chairman, to reach agreement.     He felt sure, however,  that it would not be possible to reach agreement without some contribution from theExchequer.     In this connection, he urged that the need of the cotton industry was even greater than that of the mercantile Marine at the time when his predecessor had succeeded in obtaining assistance from the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer of that day.opposing the immediate proposals of the President of theBoard of Trade, reserved his position completely as toany assistance that was proposed.discussions to be conducted by an independent Chairmanshould take place as a first step towards the drafting of theBill and not after the Bill had been drafted.this had been his intention.     His proposal for proceeding to draft a Bill was a means of arranging for discussions to take place.supported the President of the Board of Trade in remarkshe had made as to the bad effect politically and evenmore important psychologically of doing nothing.     Thecotton trade was going through difficulties in all partsof the world.     The opposition to the Joint Committee&apos;proposal was increasing.      This was due to its leader who,however, was an eminently reasonable man, -^^-m. ^co-*vc -uaJUaThe Chancellor of the Exchequer, while notThe Minister of Labour suggested that theThe President of the Board of Trade said the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs
* The Prime Minister said it would be impossiblefor the Government to sit still In this matter.      It was itsduty to take positive steps to help these people out oftheir difficultiescThe Secretary of State for Scotland said thatthere was a small cotton industry in Scotland which was interested in this matter, but he was aware that thePresident of the Board of Trade had this in mind.The Cabinet agreed:To authorise the President of the Board ofTrade to announce that he proposed toproceed with the drafting of a Billon the general lines of the revised proposals of the Joint Committee ofCotton Trade Organisations, modifiedwherever necessary in order to get themaximum agreement, and to take at his discretion other action as outlined tothe Cabinet and summarised above   He was asked to bear in mind the suggestion ofthe Minister of Labour ment oned above.
