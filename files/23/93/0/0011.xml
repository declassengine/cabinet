nvpz CABINET. 1. The Prime Minister offered a. welcome to theSecretary of State for Scotland, who was attending the Cabinet for the first time as a member.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,he said, was unable to he present as he was in attendance on the T&apos;ing.
2. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that the recent Meeting of the Council of theLeague of Nations at Geneva had been got throughreasonably well.   On the subject of Ethiopia it hadsoon become clear that no unanimous resolution couldbe obtained .    Efforts had then been directed, tosecure the right sort of statement from the various members of the Council.   A critical speech had been delivered by the High Commissioner for New Zealand,in spite of efforts to induce him to modify its terms.    The Soviet representative had also adopted a critical attitude,    ^he Bolivian representative had been somewhat cryptic, and the Chinese repre-sentative had reserved, his position.   nevertheless the speeches had enabled the President to sum upto the effect that it was  clear that, each nationmust, take its own line.
THE PAR &quot;^ASTChina and japan.(previous reference:Cabinet 22(38), Con-clusion 7.)Z . The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that at the recent Meeting at Geneva theChinese delegate hs* tried to obtain the adoptionof a Resolution favourable to China, but had not succeeded,   mhe result of the discussion had beenthe adoption or a. Resolution of sympathy with China,the endorsement of previous Resolutions,  and aResolution condemning the use of poison gas if itshould be resorted to.
4. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that the Spanish representative at Geneva,Del Vayo, had tried to secure the adoption of aResolution favourable to the cause of the SpanishGovernment,   ^he result o^ the discussion had. been somewhat deplorable, the Spanish Resolution beingrejected by 4   votes to 2, with 7 or 8 representa-tives refusing to vote at all.
5. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that, the negotiations between France andItaly for an Agreement were not proceeding verysatisfactorily.    Signor Mussolini&apos;s speech at Genoahad not. helped, matters.    One reason that had beengiven him for that speech was that after M. Eonnet,the French Foreign Minister, had voted against theSpanish Government&apos;s Resolution at Geneva he had seen*he journalists and tol^ them that they must not taketoo much notice of that viote, and that France was favourable to the Spanish cause.    There were two main difficulties in the Franco-Italian Conversations:fir^t, Spain&apos; and, second,  the Arabian Articlesfrom the Anglo-Italian Agreement,    &quot;&quot;he second, point would probably be surmounted if agreement  could bereached on the first.   On the previous day he had told the Italian Ambassadors-dor about a. message he had sent, to the Earl of Perth on the subject of signor mussolini&apos;s Genoa speech.    Count Grandi had. said, thatone reason was the annoyance of Signor Mussoliniat the active support given by France to the SpanishGovernment, on which the Foreign Secretary hadcommented that  Italy could not expect to have a monopoly of intervention in Spain.    Another reasongiven by Count Grandi was that the speech had. beenmade at Genoa, the people o^ which had the reputationin Italy of bring the worst grumblers.    Genoa wasalso in the Worth of Italy, and in consequence ofrecent events in Austria the Duce had had to speakrather plainly.

The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsCzechoslovakia,   said that Dr Henlein&apos;s visit h-^d been quite useful.He himself had first heard of the proposal fromSir Robert Vans it t. art, who ha.d received a. lettersaying that Dr Henlein had a min^ to come to london in order to acquaint himself with British opinion.He himself had thought the visit would, be useful,a.nd. had encouraged Sir Robert Vansit.ta.rt to seeDr Henlein.    Sir Robert Vans it tart ha.d formed twoconclusions  from his  conversation:    first,  that dr Henlein had no instructions from Berlin, and,second, that Dr lenes  could get an agreement of a.useful character if he would only act quickly,Mr. Winston Churchill/had communicated the resultsof the conversations to the Czechoslovak Minister,and he himself had sent a telegram to the british minister at Prague on the subject.   He added thatM. Bonnet, the French Foreign Minister. ha.d made clear at Geneva, that he wanted His Ma..jesty&apos;s Govern-ment to put as much pressure as possible on Dr Benesto reach a settlement with the Sude4-en-Deuts ch ino^der to save France from the cruel dilemma betweendishonouring her Agreements or becoming involved inwar .

They appeared to be trying to get  compensation for the American Oil Companies.mhe British Co^pani^s felt tha.t compromise was of nouse with the present Mexican Government, since evenif an agreement were reached it would not be carriedout.    &quot;&quot;he immediate outlook, therefore,  for thereturn of the properties was not good,    &quot;&quot;he british minister in Mexico City, however, and other experts,thought that the present Mexican Government wereheading for a revolution and that a new government might be easier to deal with.The Lord Chancellor pointed out that the diffi-culty in taking the Mexican Government to arbitrationwas that technically the CompanCompanMexicanThe Foreign Secretary agreed, Hut added that his claim ha^ been that His Majesty&apos;1 a Government werehounH to support their nationals, that is to say,the shareholders in the Companies.
NEW ZEAL/WD. 8. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that at the next Meeting of the(previous reference:        council of the League 0* Nations the New ZealandCabinet 22(38)Conclusion 6)  representative woul^ be in the Chair.    Unless thepresent High Commissioner altered, his general atti-tude this might be an embarrassment.The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointedout that the High Commissioners instructions fromhis Government at the recent Meeting of the council had not been open to much objection, and the HighCommissioner&apos;s personal attitude was a.lways verykindly and not unfriendly.   He gathered that thedifficulties arose fro^ one of his advisers.^he Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of St^te forForeign Affairs    and. the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs should consider drawing up a message whichcoul^ He sent/to the Prime Ministerof New zealand in which attention would,be  called to the inconveniences thatmight result from the chairmanship of the New Zealand representative at the next Meeting of the Councilof the League of Nations unless his present attitude was modified.
GERMANY. 9. The Cabinet had before them a. Memorandum byExports of the Minister for- Co-ordination of Defence (C.P.-117Armaments .(38))  circulating, in accordance with the Conclusionof the Committee of Imperial Defence at their 322nd.Meeting (Minute 6), the following Papers for theinformation of his  colleagues(a) A Memorandum on German Export ofArmaments, by the Industrial Intel-Intelligence Centre (Department of OverseasTradp)  &apos;C.T,D, Paper No .1426-B):(b) A letter dated. 27th April, 1938,from the Secretary of Sta.te forForeign Affairs to the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence onthe same subject-( c) An Extract from the draft Minutes ofthe 322n^ Meeting of the Committeeof Imperial Defence, held on 12thMay, 1938.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs raised, the question as to whether there was anything to be learned from the German system.   He suggested,that the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence andothers concerned might examine German conditions ingrea.ter detail and. see whether there was anythingbeing done in Germany which coul^ be applied, here.The Minister for Co-orJination o^ Defence pointed,out that there were several obvious lessons to belearned;    for example, the question of standardisation-tion of design (Pa.ra.d6), in which it appeared thatGermans       methods were a good deal ahead of our own.The larger issues, however, to which the foreign secretary had drawn attention, were raised, in para-graphs 9 to 12, and. 16.   There it was shown (Para .10)that the organisation of industry was in the handsof a corporate body which could get into touch withthe Minister of Defence (Pa.ra.12).    If we wanted,to apply these methods, part of the system would,have to be some measure of authority over the whole
301O U iof British industry which would enable one man, ifnecessary, to speak for the industry.   That kind, of organisation would take a long time to accomplish,but if the Cabinet thought it within the bounds of possibility of course it could be considered.   Apartfrom that, however, the Memorandum pointed out thatthe development of the German arms industry had thefollowing conseauences:-(l)  to reduce unemployment:(?.)  to increase German political influence in many countries?(3)  to stimulate trade in general,since those who first boughtarmaments afterwards boughtother goods .He suggested the desirability of examining our ownprogramme to see whether, v/hen the completion of ourpresent Service Programmes was in sight, we shouldbe able to supply our Dominions, allies and. other foreign nations.   We might, consider, as an alternative,whether it was desira.bie to set up fresh capacitywith a view to supplying these countries and obtainingin the long run an increased war potential, and, atan early elate, orders from abroad for which we shouldbe paid.   He recalled, however, that the Cabinet hadtaken a. decision against laying down plant at Govern-ment expense for the supply of foreign nations.In reply to a question he said, that when he spoke of providing additional capacity he had in mind notthe construction of new Government factories, butpossibly financial facilities to private firms.   Asan instance he mentioned the arrangements for thepurchase of Scotswood by Messrs Vickers.   He under-stood that a similar opportunity might arise before
long in the Glasgow region, where a la^ge concern for the manufacture of locomotives was likely tocome into the market.The Minister of Labour urged that the Governmentshould first consider whether full use was beingmade of existing engineering capacity,    ^here were two kin^s of firms:    first, those who had receivedorders but lacked sufficient men to carry them, out:and, second, those who had received no orders but had men who were out of ^orkr.    Before consideringthe creation of new capacity it would be necessaryto find out whether we were using our existing resources.mhe Minister for Co-ordination of refenceagreed that that aspect, of the question would ha.veto be considered.    mhe difficulty was that firmscould not, a.s a. rule, produce armaments without alot of special apparatus.The Prime Minister sa.id. that he had examinedthis document wi+h some care, especially from thepoint of view of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s preoccupa-tions with the fa.ct that Germany could alwaysundertake and  carry out  foreign orders when we were unable to do so.    It was  clear from Paragraph 8 ofthe Report f 0.LD, Paper Mo0142S-B)  that the Germanorganisation had. begun a Ion? time ago, namely,between 1920 and .    It would take us some timeto get in+o the same position.    In any event it wasclea^ that we could not do so unless we were pre-pared, to undertake the tremendous measures ofcontrol over skilled labour as in Germany, includingreduction of the time la.g by abolishing. Trade Unionrestrictions upon the number of hours of work a. d.a.y,
forcing men to take service in ne^ districts, compel-ling firms to train a. quota of apprentices, and so forth (Para .14), as well as elaborate measures forthe control of raw materials and foodstuffs (Para .18)and drastic technical devices end. stratagems in the region of finance (Para. .21).   He doubted whether thenation would be prepared to go as far as that at thepresent time.   At the or mo time the Government oughtte oce whelliei t-hcy could ohiiaia some eorvespuiiOlngr-eoult by other methods?-e-. g . T ft Minio try eM^-Supply.As the question of a. Ministry of Supply was to heraised in Debate in the House of Commons during thefollowing week, the Prime Minister summarised thelines on which he proposed to deal with it, to thefollowing effect.A Ministry of Supply is necessary in time of war,when the whole of the resources of the country haveto be developed for the prosecution of the war.Such a Ministry, however, has no special value inpeace unless it  can be endowed with all the powers that it woul^ have to possess in war:    otherwise the only result would be that the officers and offi-officials who were at present working on Supply in oneor oth^r of the Service departments would transferthemselves to a. new Ministry where they would doexactly the same thing,   ^he only/argument in favourof a Ministry was that it would avoid overlapping.He thought, however, he could safely deny that over-lapping existed, at the present time.   He did notbelieve it would be possible, in time of peace, toobtain the extra, powers for a. Ministry of Supplythat would be necessary in time of war.   He proposed,therefore, to reject the proposal for the above reasons.-12-
The prime Minister then raised the question ofwhat woulrt be the best method of examining thefigures before the Cabinet.   An effective examina-tion would involve the co-operation of industry.He thought, therefore, the best plan would be tosend the matter back to the Committee of ImperialDefence, who would consider how it  could best be handled.The Secretary of St*te for Var, while not dis-senting from the Prime Minister&apos;s opposition to aMinistry of Supply, hoped th&quot;t he would not close the door to that possibility even in time of peace.He was convinced that world re-armament was goingto be a. long business.    The whole&quot; of -our -po-ii-of. and:business interests were likely, in the long run, tobe affected,    mhe Germans were deliberately building up a system in which they would, depend -for-s-ue-te.n-ance on the maintenance of a^-market for theirarmaments.    In other words, they were interestedin keeping the world in a state of trouble.   Astate of unrest, which we treated, as the greatestdisadvantage there could be to our interests, was tothem an advantage, for Germany could not afford, to suspend her output of armaments.    Tn the course ofthese armament sales Germany was bringing othercountries within her orbit and. securing a footing inthe1&quot;&apos; which enabled her to sell other things besidesarmaments .    Our position was so different that wecould not even supply our own Dominions and. friends.Only that morninp the Press reported a speech bythe Minister of Defence in Canada about their diffi-culties in obtaining their defensive requirements in England.   During the week he was to see the
9 n crAustralian Ministers now visiting this country, aridhe would have a disappointing story to tell themabout orders given from Australia, some time ago.^-The same was true of Portugal, Egypt, Iraq and. othercountries.    Germany was undermining our position inmany countries, and this ought to be taken intoserious account.    Tn his letter of April 27th to theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence, the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs had used very gravelanguage about the dangers resulting from these developments.   He thought the country would be forcedbefore long by the German system to take very drasticsteps .   He agreed, with the Prime Minister that aMinistry of Supply was of no value without the powers that it would have to have in time of war, but hethought that the country was gradually beginning torealise that drastic measures of reorganisation wouldbe necessary.   He hoped, therefore,  that the PrimeMinister would not bang the door upon the proposalfor a. Ministry of Supply.The Secretary of State for Air pointed out thatthe Memorandum before the Cabinet raised, very largequestions as to the sufficiency of our present industryto meet our needs;    the relative importance of trade,finance, and. output of war material, and so forth.Unless some large change took place, however, inthe worltf situation, he did not believe that, we could maintain our position without some change of policy.mhe Secretary of State for India said that hehad to reply to a. Motion in the House of Lords byLord. Mottistone, who was demanding a Ministry ofSupply.   He proposer1 to reply on the lines of thePrime Minister&apos;s statement.
The Chancellor of the&apos; Exchequer recalled thatthe Munitions of IVar Act, 1915 (5 and. 6 George V,C.54), whii-li hai* Hst   up a Minis I i,y ur Supply,provided alme for the settlement of labour- differ-ences, the prohibition of lockouts or strikes,and even the suspension of &quot;brade Thr.ion Rules and practices limiting production.   He thought that anyone speaking in the Debates in either House on a.Ministry       Supply would do well to look up the debates in 191^.     ^he difference between the Germanand. the &quot;ritish positions was that the German peopleappeared to be willing fo live in a state of warv-hen they were not at war-    there were some people who claimed that we were living under conditions ofwar, owing to the incidence of taxation, but, ofcourse, that was not the case.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out  asan objection to a. Ministry       Supply in time ofpeace the difficulty over the question of personnel.In the case of war the whole of industry could be drawn on to supply the personnel of theMinistry.    In time of peace ther^. would only be a transfer of Civil Servants and others from one department to another.mhe Lord Chancellor pointed, out that thePrincipal Supply Officers Organisation provided thenecessary co-ordination in time of peace.The Prime Minister said that he had received aletter from Lord Mottistone on the question of a.Ministry of Supply.   He had asked, whether LordMottistone meant tha.t a Ministry of Supply in timeof pe^ce was to have the elaborate powers, to whichthe Chancellor of the Exchequer had. referred,taken in the case of the Munitions of Var Act, 1915,
The Minister for Co-ordination of&quot; Defence saidthat Mr Wins1&quot;on Churchill predicated an Act in two parts dealing respectively with (l) emergencypreparation service, and (2) war.   T-Ie had asked himto specify what powers he thought shoul^ be provided under the first heading, an^ Mr Churchill had refuse3to say.    Lord. Strabolgi had informed him that at. ameeting of the Labour Lords a resolution had been passed, promising support to Lord Mottistone&apos;s pro-posal for a Ministry of Supply.&quot;&quot;he Minister of Labour pointed out that, the act of 1915 had not prevented strikes.   A promise hadbeen given to labour that the restrictions should,not apply after the  Var, but some people alleged that  even now a.11 the restrictions had not been removed .The Minister of transport said that from information at his disposal he thought it probablethat contacts with British industry would, result in further information being obtained showing that thePaper before the Cabinet was an under-statement ofthe facts as to German armament production.The President of the Board, of Trade thought it important to specify exactly what. wb.s to be theobject of a fresh reference of the subject to theCommittee of Imperial Defence.   For example, wasthe object a long-range one to enable us to exportarmaments In time of peace, or was it a. short-rangeone to increase our existing means of productionduring the next year or two?   Unless the object wasspecified there was a danger that in seeking along-range object we might temporarily slow downproduction.,
The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence saidthat he would not exclude either of these objects.Some of the proposals, however, could usefully beconsidered, by the Ministers at the head of the DefencenowDepartments and himself/, without waiting to  consultindustry.   He agreed, that. a. good, deal of preparationwould be necessary before the matter could he discuss-ed with industry, and. he was prepared, to make himselfresponsible for this in consultation with the Ministericoncerned.The Prime Minister said that he hoped, the Minister^or Co-ordination of Defence would consider the possi-bility of incorporating the whole of industry insome single body, with someone at its head, who couldspeak for industry as a whole.   At present we had.only the P.?.I. and the  Confederation of Employers1Organisationsy neither of which quite met the case.The Chancellor of the Duchy o^ Lancaster said the real issue was as  to whether this country could,compete in peace and war with Germany as a.t presentorganis ed.^he Foreign Secretary considered that, what waswanted was a frank discussion with our own leadersof industry as to whether they could- help us to com-pete with German industry, and how we were to proceed .The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said,that he would reauire a good, deal of diSCussion writ.hhis  colleagues before he pot in touch with industrial-is ts .The President of the Board of Education thought-it would be necessary also to get in touch withtechnicians, and not only with the financiers at the
top of the industries \ e.g., mass product ionVe4&quot;machine-tools wag o vital elements.The Minister for Co-ordination of &quot;Defence agreed,hut said that production engineers v.-ere equally-important .The Secretary of State for India raised thequestion of export-t credits for armaments .The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat he ha,d had. some discussions t&apos;-ith the french foreign Minister at Geneva about the possibility of developing trade with the Balkan countries, andhe would, in due course, have certain proposals tomake.   He thought that these had better come beforethe Foreign Policy Committee before the question of export credits for armaments was  considered.The Ca.binet agreed  (a) To refer the Reports attached to cp.-11? (38) on Exports of GermanArmaments, to the Committee ofImperial Defence for examination in detail from the point of viewof the possible application oradaptation of German practice,rautat 1 s mutand is . to this  country,whether in the purely technical field,or in the provision of capacity for manufacturing armaments for export,or in those methods of organisationby means of which Germany has reached,her present posit ion:(b) That the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence should be responsible for preparing the various groups of questions raised in these Reportsfor the consideration of the Committeeof Imperial Defence.   He should examine,in particular, whether the varioussubjects or categories could best bedealt with Departmentally, or by thecularly in the case of the largerquestions of organisation) in consul-tat ion with representatives of Pritishindustry.   He should invite theco-operation of his colleagues atthe various stages of this inquiry to such extent as he might, deemdesirable:
(c) To approve generally the line whichthe Prime Minister proposed to take in the Debate in the House of commons on a. Ministry o^ Supply (page 12,marked &quot;A&quot;) as supplemented in thedis cuss ion.
10. The Cabinet had. before them a Note by thePresident of the Board, of Trade ( C .P.-114 (38))circulating a Memorandum prepared, by the Secretaryfor Mines, after consultation with the Departmentsconcerned, on the action to be taken in respect ofthe recommendations in the published, edition of theReport of the falmouth Committee on the Productionof Oil from Coal ( Cmd. ,5665) .    The President of theBoard of Trade proposed, with the concurrence of theChancellor of the Exchequer, that all the recommend-ations should, be accepted, with some reservation onrecommendation IT (2), which concerned the proposed,extension of. the scope of the tests carried, out bythe Department of Scientific and Industrial research on low temperature carbonisation plants .   He alsoexplained in his Memorandum that the first and. mainrecommend.a.tion, namely, that the present guaranteedpreference of 4d. per gallon on motor spirit shouldbe raised to 8d. and to be operative for 12 years from 1938, would involve legislation;    and that therecommendations relating mainly to Defence, whichwere included in the     full Report (Annex I to cp.-19 (38) and had been referred, to the Committeeof Imperial Defence at the Meeting mentioned, in the margin, were still under consideration.The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed theCabinet that he had examined the proposals of thePresident of the Board of Trade very carefully andhad decided that they would have to be carried out.Room had been left for the inclusion of a Board ofTrade Clause in the Finance Bill.
The Minister for Co-ordination of defence said that a Private Notice Question had been arrangedso as to notify the House of Commons beforehand ofthe nature of the additional Clause that would be moved for the Finance Bill,The Lord President of the Council said hehad a small amendment, to the Answer to the proposedPrivate Notice Question on the subject of recommenda-tion. II (2) on the scope of the testa to be carried out bythe Department of Scientific and Industrial research on low temperature carbonisation plants.The Cabinet agreed-:(a) To approve the proposals of thePresident of the Board of trade that all the recommendations inthe published edition of theReport of the Falmouth Committeeon the Production of Oil from coal (Cmd. 5665) should be approved, subject to a reservationon recommendation II (2) referredto ab o ve s(b) That the Chancellor of theExchequer should answer a private notice Question notifying theHouse of Commons of the natureof the additional Clause to be moved for the Finance Bill.

He was advised,however, that the Debate in the House of Commonscould not be confined to the change to be made bythe Regulation, but  could range over practicallythe whole field of the Unemployment AssistanceBoardTs administration.The Cabinet agreed;To approve the new draft Regulationquoted above authorising theUnemployment Assistance Board tomake appropriate increases and allowances during winter months in future years.

The Secretary of State for Air recalled that his predecessor had sent an Air Mission to theUnited States of America and Canada.     He had promised the Cabinet that the Mission would telegraphthe results of its enquiries.     This the Mission had done and its recommendations had been examined by theAir Council and by the Supplies Committee of the AirMinistry.     He asked whether the Cabinet wished toconsider the matter in detail or whether they would leave it to the Prime Minister, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and himself.The Prime Minister thought a preliminary discussion would be useful.The Secretary of State for Air theninformed the Cabinet that the Mission proposed topurchase 200 Lockheed Reconnaissance aeroplanesand 200 N.A. 16 Trainer aeroplanes at a total costof  4,200,000,     To this would have to be added thecost of turrets and freight.     The machines wouldbe fitted with American bomb-racks, and this would necessitate the provision of American ammunition,as British ammunition could not be fitted into theAmerican bomb-racks.     He was informed that the machines could not be adjusted to take Britishbomb-racks and ammunition.     There was also somequestion of a Douglas machine, but he was notraising that at the moment and it need not besettled before the return of the Mission.     the machines he had mentioned, however, which were strongly recommended by the Mission required anearly decision.
In the course of the discussion, a numberof criticisms were made of the proposal   to purchasethese machineSo      Of the Trainers,  for example, itcould be said that they might be made in this countrysince wood was employed in their construction.     The200 Reconnaissance machines would be an odd lot.     Theymight require special training for personnel;    a numberspare parts would be needed and we might regret the day when we had purchased thems    all this apart from thedifficulties of American bomb ammunitiono     Theproposal was raised as t    the effect :f the AmericanNeutrality Act and whether additional supplies ofammunition could be obtained in the event of war.It was suggested that the proposal would be more acceptable if the reserve machines and future machinescould be supplied from Canada0The Cabinet were informed that by the end of next year, it was pr bable that only 150 machinescould be obtained..     No particulars were available,however, as to the rate of monthly deliveries.     Itwas suggested that enquiry should be made as towhether, in that period of time, equally good machinescould not be constructed in this country,,The Cabinet were reminded of the growingadverse balance of trade with the United States ofAmerica as one of the points that ought not to be overlooked.The Cabinet agreed:(a)    That the Secretary of State for. Air should at once obtain thefullest possible information on the details of the proposal,including a schedule of the monthly deliveries;    whetherAmerican ingenuity could notsubstitute British bomb-racksand ammunition for the Americanarticles;    and the possibility ofobtaining future supplies both of aeroplanes and ammunition from canada.- 27 -
(b) That, if possible, the Secretary ofState for Air should postpone adecision until the next regular weekly meeting of the Cabinet:(c) That, if postponement should prove impossible, the question should bedealt with by the Prime Minister,the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Secretary of State for Air.M Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.18th May, 1938.
