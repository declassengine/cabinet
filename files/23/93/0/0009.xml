Phipps (Paris)  (No.291 of the 3rd May) report-ing that Senor Ouinones de Leon had informed him that enormous quantities of arms and ammunition

9 99-J *JETJROPE. 3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,ovakia. continuing his comments on the Anglo-French Conversa-tions, sai^ that a long discussion har* taken pl8ce onthe subject of Czechoslovakia.    The Prime Minister and himself had done their best to impress on the french minister? the need of a pacific procedure.    The main point for which the French Ministers pressed was that,at some stage or other His Majesty&apos;s Government should,combine any advice which, in conjunction with theFrench Government, they might give to Dr. Benes, witha guarantee that if he accepted that advice and actedupon it he could  count, upon full British support ifthe German Government rejected his proposals a.ndCzechoslovakia became a victim of German aggression.mhe Prime Minister anci himself, however, had. urgedthat Czechoslovakia should be pressed to make whatconcessions she could, but to leave her in no doubta^ to what she coul^ or coulr&apos; not  expect from us inthe way of assistance.    It had. been agreed, also thatthere shoul^ be a. demarche in Berlin by His Majesty&apos;ambassador, who would explain that H.M.S. were doing their best to ^in^ a peaceful solution of the problem and had aske^1 Dr. Penes to make his  contribution.He woul^ add that H0F.G. considered a pa.cific settle-ment possible, an^ would urge the German Government touse their good offices with Herr Henlein and not tomake new difficulties.    On the previous evening he(the Secretary of State) ha^1 sent a telegram to his majesty&apos;s  jesty&apos;s Amba.ssa.dor in Berlin to this effect and as kinghim to make representations to Field-Marshal Goering,who was the only important membe^ of the government at present in Berlin.   He had done this because he had.been slightly anxious lest, in view of the Field-Marshals notorious antipathy to the Czechoslovaks,
2? Ihe might ta.ke some provocative action in the absenceof Herr Hitler, and other members of the Government,in Rome. A message was also to be sent to Dr. Beneson the lines indicated above.Apart from the Anglo-French Conversations, theForeign Secretary said that  in the course of his shortconversation with the new German Ambassador he had mentioned the question of Czechoslovakia.    mheAmbassador had seemed to think th^t a peaceful settle-ment was not impossible, provided that it was based onthe equality of the Sudeten Deutsch in czechoslovakia.He h^d also sai^ that if, later on, H.M.G. were to approach the German Government on the subject theGermans would not be likely to say that  it was not ourbusiness, though he had laid stress on the importanceof adopting the right method of approach.   He had thought that Herr Hitler might even be glad of atactful approach, and he had said that the GermanGovernment had warned Herr Henlein to keep his demandswithin rea.sona.ble bounds.The Foreign Secretary said that he had also had a conversation with the Czechoslovak Minister, who had given him an encouraging account of the attitude of dr. Benes towards the Sudeten Deutsch.    The minister had also sa.id that Dr. Masaryk ha.d never desired, to absorb the Sudeten Deutsch into Czechoslovakia, butthat they had been forced, upon him by Mr Lloyd. George.He understood, however, f^ora the Marquess of Lothian,who ha.d been associated with Mr Lloyd George at thetime, that this was entirely incorrect.The Secretary, who had also been associated withMr Lloyd George,  confirmed the Marquess of Lothian&apos;sreoolle ction.
Tn reply to questions, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs said that the aim of his policy was toavoid saying anything which could be construed as aovercommitment/    Czechoslovakia.   His general line was tosay to the Czechoslovak Government that they had gotto go as long a way as they could to meet the SudetenDeutseh, and to remind the Germans that two were required to make a settlement and that they must help.Tt mieht be very useful if the Germans would tell us at some time what would satisfy them.   But we wouldhave to be very careful to assume no responsibility.At the end Qr the negotiations a position might bereached where he could say to the Germans that theycould get, say, 75 per cent, of what they wanted, by peaceful means    and urge on them the folly of riskingwar in order to get 100 per cent.Tn reply to a question he said, that he had. madequite plain to the Czechoslovak Minister that we couldnot give any kind of guarantee.mhe Prime Minister emphasised the importance ofthe Foreign Secretary&apos;s remarks on this point.    If wewere to say to Dr. Benes  &quot;You must be moderate&quot; andhe was then to make a. proposal which we thought oughtto meet the German requirements and. we were to tell theGerman Government this was our view, we might easilyget a snub, which would be more especially inconvenientwhen we were not prepared to take strong action if they refused.    It was clear, however, that there would be no value in Dr. Benes securing an agreement&apos;with HerrHenlein unless it. was endorsed by the German Government.He wanted, if possible, to get the Germans to say whatkind 0f settlement would be acceptable.   Much depended,upon our being abl^ to establish our relations in this
matter with Germany on a proper footing so that we could use our good offices with them. If, however the German Government were to turn round and say that this was not our business, we should have to impress upon them that we had done all we could to secure peaceful solution: that we had warned them that if they took aggressive action France was bound to honour her Treaty with Czechoslovakia: that in that event no guarantee could be given that we should not be drawn in, and consequently that Germany blood was on their own head. All, however, turned on conversations being undertaken in the right atmosphere and at the right time.

He gave the Cabinet some account of a conversation he had had with Mr Arthur Henderson, M. P., who had visited Czechoslovakia and had seen Dr. Benes and Herr Henlein. The latter had told him that he desired a solution somewhat on the lines of a cantonal system. Mr Henderson had then produced an ethnological map showing the Sudeten Deutsch population dotted round the frontiers in relatively small packets, and had asked how it was possible to create a cantonal system? Herr Henlein had then explained that what he really wanted was that each region should have its own Council and that there should be a Central Council to deal with more important matters, such as the University, and that the whole of these Councils should be financed by a block grant from the Government. Mr Henderson had then remarked that this was not the cantonal system He had comminicated what Herr Henlein had said to Dr. Benes, who had said that he had no idea that that had been in Herr Henlein&apos;s mind.


The attention of the Cabinet was  called to atelegram from Sir E, Phipps f Paris) (No.290 Saving,of the 2nd May)  describing the reaction of the french press to the London Conversations.    So far as Czecho-slovakia. v-as  concerned, almost the whole of the Presswere ins is tins? that the united kingdom was now boundto support France in any action the latter might take on behalf of Czechoslovakia.   M. Daladier had assured the Ambassador that this attitude ha.d. not in any waybeen inspired by himself.The Cabinet were reminded of the dangerousreactions in foreign countries of such an attitude on the part of the French Press if not  contradicted.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat the French Ministers were under no illusions onthis subject, but he had under consideration an instruction to His Majesty1 s Ambassador in Paris totake some stronger action with the French Governmentto correct the impression broadcast in the french press.A suggestion was made that the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs should consider the desirabilityeither of inviting 4is MajestyTs Ambassador in berlin to visit London in order to obtain first-hand a correct impression of the attitude of H.M..G. towardsCzechoslovakia, or, alternatively, that he should.writ e him a. personal letter.^he Foreign Secretary undertook to consider these proposals.
FRANCEcProposedStaff Con-versa t ions .(previous reference:Cabinet 21(38), Con-elusion 3 .)4, Turning to the question of Staff Conversations,the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thata. good deal of talk had taken place on this subject,^he Prime Minister and himself had begun by explainingour position on the general lines already decided upon by the Cabinet.   As he had anticipated, the french had pressed them strongly for Conversations betweenthe Army General Staffs, and the Prime Minister and himself had used the latitude which had been given them by the Cabinet at the Meeting referred, to in the margin, and had accepted the proposal -Tor MilitaryStaff Conversations with all cautions and reserves.The French had also made a very strong point aboutNaval Conversations, stressing the importance ofmaintaining their communications with Africa, andreferring to the possibility of having to use the atlantic ports.    The Prime Minister and himself hadha.d to recognise that point and that we were bound,in carrying out our commitments under the Treaty of locarno, to facilitate such movements.    They had made clear, however, that it was important to avoid,any a.ction that would agitate the Italian Governmentunduly.    Eventually they had agreed, that, provided,the Naval Staff Conversations were proceeded withsomewhat slowly, there was no objection in principle,Tn doing so they had extended to the Naval spherethe discretion given to them by the Cabinet to agreeto Army Staff Conversations.The attention of the Ca.bj.net was drawn to apa.ssage in a despatch ^rom Sir Nevile Henderson. (No .381, of April 20, 1938, Para.8) which indicated that Pield-Marshal Goering, at any rate, alreadyregretted the Naval Agreement and hoped to escape from it.    The question was raised as to whether the
 nglo-French Naval Conversations might not providethe occasion.^he First Lord, of the Admiralty recalled thatthis was the main objection of the Naval Staff tosuch Conversations.   He himself took the view, however,that the Germans would denounce the Naval Tre8.tywhenever this suited them, and he did not think thatthey would ever believe that Conversations could takeBritish 8nd Frenchplace between the^/General Stafls an^ Air Staffswithout beine extended to the Naval sphere.mhe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs didnot think that the extension of the Conversations tothe Navy was going to aggravate the German view.Immediately a^ter the meetings he had seen the GermanCharge d&apos;Affaires and had explained to him that theproposed Conversations were a. continuation of contactsalready begun and that no new commitments had been undertaken.    &quot;he new German Ambassador, whom he had very recently received, had communicated to him HerrRiVientrop&apos;s thanks for this message and had statedthat the German Government took note of it.    He had.adopted, this  channel of communication with the GermanGovernment in preference to the rather more formalchannel of a telegram to ^erlin immediately after the conversations in deference to the doubts of the FrenchGovernment as to the advisability of a telegram.The Prime Minister said that both he and theForeign Secretary had been rather taken aba.ck at thegreat importance attached by the French delegation to the Naval Conversations.   They had begun by refusing such Conversations.    Later they had received information through official  channels that the french were very upset and were attaching an importance to
Naval Conversations out of all proportion to their real value.    By lunch-time on the second day it had become clear that the success of the Conference was threatened,by our attitude in this matter.   He and his colleaguetherefore felt boun^ to make the concession.Tn the course of the discussion attention was called to the stress laid by the French government representatives on the motorisation of the two british divisions which might, in certain circumstances, besent to France.    Tn addition, it was recalled that theCabinet had contemplated one mechanised Division aswell as the two Divisions as the maximum force whichcould he sent if the Government of the day shoul^ sodeeide .The Secretary       State for Foreign Affairs saidthat he himself had been careful to avoid speaking of the&quot;Mechanised Division&quot;   .    Tn fact, he had asked for an amendment of the Conclusions of the Cabinet, referred,to in the margin, on this matter, so as to omit mention of the Mechanised. Division.The Prime Minister sai^ that he had been careful not to commit himself on the question of the motorisa-tion of these Divisions, and had pointed, out that if their equipment was different from the equipment forgeneral service for the other Divisions it would, be tantamount, to a confession that we had accepted a commitment.   He assume^, however, that this was thekind of question *hat would be liable to be raised bythe French Staff in the course of the forthcomingConversations.The Foreign Secretary said that there were a. fewpoints arising out of the Conversations on which he proposed to consult the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee:e.g,, as to the scope of the Naval and military conversations.
The Cabinet agreed  FSLGTTM.Proposed.Staff Con-versa t ionswith.(previous reference:Cabinet 19(38),  Con-elusion 4.)(a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should eonsultthe Chiefs of Staff Sub-committee as to any points he considered necessary arising out of the Anglo-French Conversations, an^ that heshould ask for the Report to be furnished as soon as possible:(b) That the Secretary of State should,be authorised to inform the Chiefsof Staff that the general scope ofthe Conversations was as outlined in the record of the Anglo-french conversations ( C.P.-109 (38)):( c) That Conversations with the BelgianGovernment should be undertakenthrough the channel of the service attaches.    Tn their case nothing should be published, and no commu-nicat ion should be made to theGerman Government.

The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that he had seen the Roumanian Minister who reported that his Government was adopting a betterattitude tov/ards the Jews and that there was aconsiderable detente in Roumania on this question.The Minister had added that nothing could be moredetrimental than pressure from Geneva.     He himself had told the Minister that if the Roumanian Government hada case to make on those lines, it would be as well thatthey should make it at Geneva.      It would, however, bea great mistake on their part not to answer thequestions put to them by the League.^ Council of ThrojiS.

Paper No ,1421-B) prepared, in collaboration between the General Staff (War Office)and. the Industrial Intelligence Centre (Department of overseas Tra.de), together with an extract from thedraft Minutes of the discussion thereon by    theCommittee of Imperial Defence-
(The Lord Advocate entered at this point.)13. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary (CP.-105 (38)), prepared inconsultation with the Attorney-General, referringin particular to criticisms of the special powers^af^.^-interrogation under Section 6 of the Official secrets act, 1920, which made it a criminal offence to refuseto give, on the demand of a responsible officer ofpolice, information relating to an offence, orsuspected offence, against the Official Secrets Act.Articles had appeared, in the Press contending that&quot;legislation devised to counter espionage should not become an instrument of inquisition and punishment intrifling matters in an ordinary journalises every-daywork&quot;, and. holding the view that the special powersof Section 5 should only be used, when the disclosureinvolved military, naval or State secrets.   The Home   &apos;Secretary felt that some concession should be made inthis respect, and. accordingly proposed that the powerof interrogation should be used only in exceptionaleases where the information disclosed was itself, inthe judgment of the Attorney-General or the HomeSecretary, of specially serious importance.    If this general principle commended itself to the Cabinet, theHome Secretary proposed to invite representatives ofthe Press to a Conference at which he would emphasisepoints enumerated at the end of his Memorandum.The Lord Chancellor, while agreeing in thegeneral line proposed by the Home Secretary in his memorandum, emphasised that bribery of a publicofficial such as a policeman was a very grave crime,more especially when it would result in a criminalbeing fore-warned and enabled to escape.     He asked that the Home Secretary should investigate this aspect of the question.
The Lord Advocate said that, under thePrevention of Corruption Act, he had carried out succesful prosecutions and had secured the conviction of policemen who had accepted, and persons who had offered,&quot;bribes, though in those particular cases thebriber had not been connected with the Press.expressed some doubt as to whether what the HomeSecretary now proposed to say to the Press differedmaterially from the attitude adopted hitherto.     there appeared some risk that the Press might deduce that theGovernment had weakened in this matter as the result oftheir agitation.,should be a rule that the Press were not to publishanything on matters which from time to time werenotified to them by the Home Secretary for this purpose.He did not think that the Government need necessarily be deterred from legislating on this question.     Muchdepended on how the matter was presented and if it wasmade clear that the intention was not to impugn thegood faith of the whole Press but only to provide for the&quot;black sheep&quot;, the opposition might not be very serious.After considerable discussion, the cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the general lines of theproposals of the Home Secretary as setforth in CP. 105 (38) %(b) That the Home Secretary should giveconsideration to the proposal of thePrime Minister that a rule should be laiddown for the Press by legislation ifnecessary that nothing was to be published on matters which from time to time would beexpressly notified to them for thispurpose by the Home Secretary, L*Ur iLU,&quot; o-w.The Minister for Co-ordination of defence the Prime Minister made a proposal that there

After describing the facts of the case, the effects of the Judgment, and thepurposes of the proposed Bill, the Minister suggestedthat the Bill, if approved, might conveniently beintroduced in the T-Touse of Lords.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the proposals of theMinister of Health as set forth in cp. 103 (38):(b) That the Minister of Health should examine a suggestion by the LordChancellor that there should be imposed a time limit after the relevant quarter day within whichthe proposed procedure could beapplied.
