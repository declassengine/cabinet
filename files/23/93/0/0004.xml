FRANCE.&quot;previous reference:Cabinet 16 (38)Conclusion 6.)1.     The Prime Minister read to the cabinet a translation of the following letter dated Saturday,the 26th March, which he had received from M. Blum:-&quot;Dear Mr. Chamberlain,Since I am at this moment the headof the French Government, allow me to tellyou in the name of my colleagues and on my own account how much we were touched by yourdeclarations last Thursday on the subjectof the bonds which unite our country andyours.     We fully understand their importance and we feel also that theexpression you have given to them increasestheir value.&quot;The Prime Minister added later that he haddined with the French Ambassador on the previous evening.     The Ambassador had told him that there wasno possibility of the French Government having beenmisled by anything Mr. Lloyd George might have saidduring his visit to Paris, as he did not count for anything in France at present.     The Ambassador had anticipated that the present French Government wouldprobably not last very long;    that M. Blum might besucceeded by M. Daladier, but that it was doubtfulwhether M. Daladier&apos;s Government would be of a durablecharacter.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs read a personal letter from His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Paris giving some account of Mr. Winston Churchill&apos;recent visit to Paris, where he had advocated an anglo-French alliance, staff talks and an effort bythe two countries to bring various democraticEuropean countries into combination with a view toresisting the Dictator countries.     The Ambassador had added   that when a more durable French Government was formed, he hoped that some British Ministers wouldvisit Paris in order to give the French Government a proper appreciation of the British attitude.
The Foreign Secretary added that he himself had seen Mr. Winston Churchill since his return.     the conversation did not add very much to what might havebeen expected from his visit.     He said that Mr. churchill had pressed for staff conversations and he had added twouseful items of information, namely, first that theFrench had dropped any idea of intervention in Spainbecause General Gamelin had told the Government that,inthe event of intervention, they would have to mobilisethe army;    and second, certain information (which lord halifax gave the Cabinet) of a highly?- secret character as to French plans in the event of a German aggression against Czecho-Slovakia.
CEKPRAL- EUROPE.        2.  With reference to the Conclusion mentioned inSituation in.       the margin, the Cabinet took note of a Most secret memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign(previous reference: Affairs (CP.-76 (38))  circulating copies of theCabinet 16(38), Con- despatch sent to His Majesty&apos;s Amba-ssa^or in Pariselusion 1.),^^\,^   on &quot;the 22nd March instructing him to  communicate withthe French Government in regard to the situation created by the absorption of Austria in the GermanReich and the possibility of German action in Czeeho-slovakia similar to that taken in Austria.    TheSecretary of State also attached copies of two tele-grams containing supplementary instructions sent tothe Ambassador on the 23rd March.
ITALY. 3&quot;     The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsConversations       reported that the conversations with the Italianwith.Government were going well.     Nothing had been agreed(Previous to that went beyond the Cabinet instructions.Reference:Cabinet 16 (38)   Difficulties had arisen on the question of exchange of conclusion 4.)information, and the Foreign Office were discussing their. Itfi^j matter with representatives of the Service Staffsthat morning.     It was possible that he might have tocome back to the Cabinet and ask for permission to omit the subject from the eventual Agreement.Coming to the time-table, the foreign secretary said that Signor Mussolini and Count Cianowere anxious to complete the agreement and to publishit - even though it was not coming into immediateoperation - before Herr Hi tier&apos;s visit to Rome onApril 15th, in order that they might be able to showHitler that they had other friends besides the Germans.The matter had been discussed at the CabinetCommittee on Foreign policy on the previous day and ithad been felt that His Majesty&apos;s Government ought notto object to this, provided that some arrangementcould be made for explaining the position of the twopre-requisites to an agreement, namely, the Italianrequisite of recognition of their position in Abyssiniaand our insistence on a clearing-up of the Spanishdifficulty.      The Committee on Foreign Policy had agreed on the previous day that, as between raising thematter at the Council of the League on May 9th orSeptember 9th, the former date was preferable-.     Anumber of States Members of the League,including fiveW Members of the Council,had taken action amounting toformal recognition of Italian sovereignty overAbyssinia, and a formula had been agreed upon underwhich we and other nations similarly situated would
ob tain freedom to decide the matter in the light of ourown situation and obligations.     We should then be in aposition to take advantage of this liberty of action assoon as the situation in Spain permitted.     arrangements had been made to communicate with Prance and othercountries that were Members of the Council of the Leagueas v/ell as with the Dominions on the subject.     This wasthe only alternative to putting the Italian Agreementinto &quot;cold storage&quot; pending the clearing-up of the issuesrelating to Abyssinia and Spain and that course was opento grave objections including the danger of losing theAgreement.     Under the arrangements contemplated by theCommittee on Foreign Policy, provision would be made for tAgreement to come into operation at some stage to be agreebetween the two Governments.The Cabinet approved the above proposal.
4.      The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said, that the reasons for summoning a meeting of(previous reference: the Non-intervention Committee (as announced in theC^inet 16 (38)Conclusion 1.)       Press) were partly parliamentary, partly because thep/S lifil&apos;)^-     long delay was widely assumed in some quarters to bedue to the Italian Government and partly to enablethe Earl of Plymouth to inform the Committee as tothe position of his efforts to bring the Britishformula into operation as well as of the difficulties that he had encountered.      He warned the Cabinet notto expect too much to come of the meeting.The Chancellor of the Exchequer expressedthe hope that the Earl of Plymouth wo\ild not find itnecessary to mention the decision as to our willingness to contribute to the cost of camps to beestablished in connection with non-intervention.The Secretary/ of State for Foreign Affairsaslced that if, in the discussion of the scheme, thequestion of cost arose, the Earl of Plymouth shouldhave discretion to state that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere prepared to take their share with others of theexpenses involved.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed.The Cabinet agreed:That if the question of the british share of the cost of the plan for thewithdrawal of volunteers was raised at the forthcoming meeting of the Non-intervention Committee,  the Earl ofPlymouth should have discretion to mention that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere prepared to pay their share aspart of a scheme in which the other powers concerned made their respectivecontribution.
SPAIN.I    -Pjxchange ofI prisoners.^previous Reference:jCabinet 10 (38)I Conclusion 2.)f   .   ft/?. / 9 L^%)&quot;b.5.      In reply to questions, the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs stated that the arrangement underwhich it was proposed to appoint Field Marshal sir philip Chetwode as arbitrator on difficulties arisingout of the proposed exchange of prisoners of war between the tv/o contending parties in Spain was, forthe moment, in abeyance as both sides were makingdifficulties.     At one time, the prospects had been favourable but General Franco&apos;s recent successesappeared to have altered the situation.
6o     The Secretary of State for Air informed theCabinet that at the 314th meeting held on March 24th,1938, the Committee of Imperial Defence had agreed -&quot;To authorise the Secretary of State forAir to explore forthwith, in consultationwith the Treasury, the possibility of purchasing from the United States ofAmerica a certain number of the militarisedDouglas machines, which have been reported as suitable for our purposes.&quot;He had ascertained that Lord Weir&apos;s brother, who had great experience, would be willing to proceed to theUnited States of America and he gave the name of anofficer of the Royal Air Force, whom he had selectedto accompany him.      Their mission would be to investigate not only the militarised Douglas machines,but to explore the possibility of purchasing any otheruseful machines.     No orders would be placed withoutthe approval of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence in-formed the Cabinet that, at the meeting referred to by th;Secretary of State for Air, the Committee of ImperialDefence had also agreed -&quot;To consider further, at the earliestpossible date, the general question of the usefulness of further approach to theUnited States and Canada in the light of thememorandum mentioned by the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence.&quot;In accordance with this conclusion, he had circulated amemorandum for consideration by the Committee ofImperial Defence on the following day.     He thought itwould be useful and would not involve undue delay ifthe question raised by the Secretary of State for Airwas postponed until the meeting of the Gommittee ofImperial Defence.   x/&apos;The Secretary of State for Air accepted thissuggestion, but referred to the urgency of his own
proposal which was for a visit by a minimum number ofpersons which would be kept as secret as possible.Theproposals of the Minister for Co-ordination of Defenceappeared to involve a larger mission covering a much wider field.The Air Ministry could not hope to makeany useful purchases in Canada.If his own proposal was approved, he would have to ask the Foreign Secretaryto send a telegram of explanation to His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Washington.The Cabinet agreed:(a) That the proposal of the Secretary ofState for Air to send a confidentialmission to the United States ofAmerica to explore and report uponthe possibility of purchases of aircraft in that country should be remitted to the Committee of Imperial;Defence, which was to meet on thefollowing day   to consider the general question of the usefulness of afurther approach to the United State?and Canada, with a view to thepurchase of war material:(b) That, in the event of the Committeeof Imperial Defence agreeing tothe immediate mission proposed bythe Secretary of State for Air, thelatter should inform the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs of thenature of the communication he wouldlike to have sent to His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Washington.9
7. The First Lord of the Admiralty informed, theCabinet that, as the result of a Meeting held between representatives of the United Kingdom, the United Statesof America and France at the Foreign Office on theprevious day, the United Kingdom and. the United Statesof America had decided to take advantage of the provi-sions in the London Naval Treaty of March 25, 1935,for &quot;escalation&quot;, in view of the uncertainty as tothe intentions of the Japanese Government.    their decision would become operative within three months.The French Government did not wish to &quot;escalate&quot; atthe present time or until some other European Powerdecided to exceed the qualitative provisions of theTreaty.
-g-[R-g. 8. &quot;&quot;he Secretary of State for Dominion AffairsNegotiations informed the Cabinet that he had nothing definitewith.to report on the subject of the negotiations with Eire(Previous Suggestions had been received, from the Government ofReference:Cabinet 16 Northern Ireland, which were beins considered Depart-(38), Con-clusion ci.) mentally.    It would probably be necessary for theIrish Situation Committee to meet before long toconsider them.
g0   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thLord Chancellor (CP.-73 (38)) on the subject, of theCourt of Appeal, which, as at present, constituted,was unable to discharge the work laid upon it by statute.   After describing the position in the Courtof Appeal and the state of business in the ^ing&apos;bench and Chancery Divisions, the Lord Chancellorproposed, with the concurrence of the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, that legislation should be promotedproviding that -(a) three additional Lords Justices shouldbe appointed&quot;(b) an obligation should be laid upon allLords Justices hereafter appointed.to sit in any Division of the HighCourt in which they may be requestedso to sit by the Lord. Chancellor,sunject, in the case of the Kiing&quot; bench Division, to the consent ofthe Lord Chief Justice&quot;(c) the first vacancy occurring in theChancery Division should not be filled,so that the number of Judges in thatDivision should be five, unless and.until it appeared, to the Lord Chancellor,with the consent of the Treasury, havingregard to the state of business in the division, that it was necessary again to raise it to six.In the course of a discussion the Secretary ofState for India informed the Cabinet that he hadreceived strong representations from public men inIndia, both Moslems and Hindus, whose opinion was endorsed by the Viceroy, on the subject of the composition of the Judicial Committee for hearingIndian Appeals.    The feeling was growing in india that unless two Law Lords were included, in the IndianCourts the Judicial Committee possessed, no advantage over the Indian Court of Appeal.The Lord Chancellor agreed that the question of appeals from India and the Dominions was a. matterof great importance.    In his view, the hearing of-12-
Indian Appeals ought to include two Law Lords andthree competent persons vho could not. be described as amateurs.   His proposals would indirectly assistthe Judicial Committee, as it was anticipated thatthe third Court of Appeal would not occupy the whole time of the new Lords Justices, some of whom couldfrom time to time he lent to the Judicial Committee.He was most anxious to give immediate moral support to the Court of Appeal, which was badly overworked.The Prime Minister warned, the Cabinet that, owingto pressure on the Parliamentary time-table, it was extremely doubtful whether time could be found forthe passing of this measure durinc the present Session,Suggestions were made that if the Bill could not becarried in the present Session it might be introducedtowa/r^s the end of the Session in order to reveal theGovernments intentions, or, alternatively, that someother appropriate announcement might be made of theGovernment&apos;s intentions in the matter. It could, then-be included in the *&quot;ing&apos;s Speech for the next session and passed before Christmas.The Cabinet agreed  (a.) mo approve the proposals of the Lord.Chancellor as set forth in CP.-73 (38)and summarised above:(b) That the Lor^ Chancellor should have authority to draft and print thenecessary legislation:( c) That the date of introduction shouldbe reserved for discussion with theParliamentary Secretary to the Treasury.
