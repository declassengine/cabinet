The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsSituation in.    sai^ that he had been considering the action to betaken to follow up       observations included in the(previous reference:       Prime Minister s statement in the House of Commons on cabinet 17(38) , Con- Foreign Affairs and Re-armament on the 24th March, 1938,conclusion ion 2 .)and in the enclosure to his own Despatch to Paris ofp-o ) a        2-.r      &apos;L 22nd March, 1938 ( C .P.-76 (38), Enclosure I) , showingthe importance of the Czechoslovak positiono   He had come to the conclusion that the general line might bestate^ as  follovs      &quot;^eryone agrees that the situation of Czechoslovakia is one of particular danger, and weshould make every possible effort  to avert it involving the world in trouble.    In London the amount o? informa-tion available about Czechoslovakia was insufficient toenable us to suggest a settlement.    It was not sufficient-ent to bear in mind the justice of any plan that might,be drawn up&quot;    it wa.s also necessary to remember thatthe settlement had to have value with Germanyc   Hethought, therefore, that the right  course was to makea  communication to the French Government in which hewould suggest to them a. joint approach by the twoGovernments urging Dr. Eenes to co^e to terms with the sudeten-Deutsch and with Germany while this was stillposs i^le.While the above opinions had heen forming in his mind, one of his  collea.colleagues had h^d a private conversa-tion with the Czechoslovak Minister in London and had given him the. very proper advice that the Governmentof his  country ought to try and put its house in order.The Minister had shor+ly after visited Prague, and from recent in^information+ion it was clear that Dr. Eenes and his* Government were doing their utmost to work out, plans
for meeting the German discontents.    That, however,was no reason to deter us -from communicating with theFrench Government with a view to a joint approach tothe Czechoslovak Government, and he asked  the Cabinetto approve this policy in principle and to allow theForeign Policy Committee to assist, him in its detailedappli cat ion.The Foreign Secretary added that he had noticed, atendency in France rather to over-rate the likelihood,of our rendering assistance to that country in coming to the aid of Czechoslovakia..   He proposed to take theopportunity to instruct His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in-Paris to correct this view.In reply to a question, he said that it might bedesirable not only to make a move at Prague jointly with the French, but also to say something at Berlina.s to the genuineness of Czechoslovak efforts.   He felt,however, that we should exercise some caution in allowingDr. Benes to draw us into expressing an opinion as tothe details of his proposals .Tn the course of a short discussion the latter view was supported on the ground that however reasonablethose proposals might be, Herr Hitler might want more.mhe fact was that the Sudeten-Deutsch were so mixed up with the Czechoslovak population that, a/fair and equitable-The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the general line which theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs proposed to adopt, as summarised ahove:(b) That, the details should he remitted tothe Cabinet Committee on Foreign Policy,which, the Prime Minister said, shouldbe ahie to report before Easter.oable solution was
ITALY o[conversations(lithepreviousReference:Cabinet 17(58), Con-elusion 3 o )OPINFORMATION-(previous reference:Cabinet. 28(37), Con-conclusion ion 2 o)2c    The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that an account o-e the draft Agreement withthe Italian Government which had appeared in the&quot;Evening Standard&quot; on the previous day was textuallyalmost corrects    From enquiries he had made he gathered that there was hardly room for doubt that leaka.ges were constantly occurring, under instructions  from signor mussolini himself, ^om the Italian Embassy (hut withoutthe connivance of the Ambassador) direct to a well-knownCorrespondent of foreign origin, whose name he mentioned to the Cabinet,    The present lea.ka.ge had almost certainlyoccurred through this  channel, and. he proposed to makestrong representations in Rome.This proposal met with the strongapproval o-e the Cabinet.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs sa.idthat the Italian Foreign Minister was anxious toinitial the Agreement on Maundy Thursday.    The agreement as a whole hart made very good progress, but there were a few rather troublesome points, wrhich, however, wouldprobably get settled.In reply to a question as to Sir Miles Lampson&quot; s objections to a. passage in the draft Agreement aboutthe Suez Canal, he drew attention to a reassuringtelegram that ha^ been sent, to His Ma.jesty&quot; s ambassador in Cairo (P.O. ^telegram No* 182, of April 5th);.    if sir Miles Lampson maintained his objections it might benecessary to obtain a. le+ter from Count Ciano containingan assurance that Italy did not interpret the clause as justifying a claim to protect the Canal until Egyptcould do it for herself   an assurance which theItalian Foreign Minister had already given verbally.
SPAIN.Exchange ofprisoners .(previous reference:Cabinet 17(38), Con-elus ion 5 .)3. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that he had had a talk with Field-marshal sir Philip Chetwode about the exchange of prisoners .The position was that General Franco ha^ agreed toaccept the Field-Marshal as Arbitrator, but that no answer had been received from the Spanish Government,who, no doubt, were much preoccupied, with their difficulties.   mhe Fiel^-Marshal was standing by, buthe feared that the prospect of his services beingreauired was receding *

Refugees in Spain had. no prospectof satisfying the conditions attached to the UnitedKingdom grant of  25,000, approved at the meeting mentioned in the margin.   He therefore suggested that,in the circumstanees outlined in his Memorandum -(a) The original offer of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should, now be withdrawn.(b) In its place His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould offer to contribute  10,000, on condition that an equivalent of this amount is available from elsewhere.( c) Over and. above this amount His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should, offer to contribute,up to a. maximum of  10,000,  1,000 forevery  2,000 collected elsewhere.    Thisproposal, which provides that the british contribution shell in any case not exceedha.lf the total of the contributions, isdesigner) to encourage further contribu-tions and to preserve as far as possiblethe intern0tional character of the scheme.The Secretary of State also suggested that a renewedcontribution of  5,000 should be made for the presentyear to the International Red Cross, subject, as before,to the condition that His Majesty&apos;s Government aresatisfied that, a reasonable number of contributions were still being received from other Governments.   he added, that the total amount of the contributions nowproposed did. not exceed, the amount already approved, bythe Cabinet.After a short discussion the Cabinet agreed.  (i) That the original offer of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should now be withdrawn:(li) That in its place His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should offer to contribute  10,000on condition that an equivalent of this amount is available from elsewhere:(iii) Not to approve the proposal in (c) above,but that if the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs found that more than
 10,000 was forthcoming from othercountries and considered that a further contribution to the international schemewas desirable and. justifiable, he should approach the Chancellor of the Exchequer:( iv) That r, subject to the approval of theChancellor of the Exchequer (who wishedto look into the details of the proposal),a renewed contribution of  5,000 shouldbe made for the present year to theInternational Red Gross, over and abovethe contribution mentioned in (ii) above:(v) To take note that the -/ar Office havebeen, and still are, lending campequipment for the use o^ the Basquechildren in this country (of whom thereare still 2,000):    that they are unableto obtain any payment for its hire;    andthat this in itself is a. contribution tothe Spanish refugee problem.
[RE.3gotiationsith.previousWbference:Bbinet 17 (38)ilnclusion 8.)6.     The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs said he had nothing further to report as to thenegotiations with Eire, but the Irish situation committee would, he anticipated, be meeting withina few days and after that a further report would bemade to the Cabinet.
iio7o     The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs raised three points under the headings mentioned inthe margin:I,   He recalled that the Committee of Imperialhad recommended that the decisions of the Governmenton the subject of the Role of the Army should becommunicated to the French Government (313th Meeting,conclusion (20) attached to CP. 72 (38)). and that theCabinet had approved the recommendation (Cabinet 16 (38)conclusion 6 (d)) while reserving the questionsmentioned in II and III belowe     The Foreign Office andthe War Office were still in consultation as to theterms in which this communication should be made0     Thedate had been postponed on the ground that it was likely to give a shock to the French Government at atime when it was not in a position to sustain a shock.The question arose as to when the communication shouldbe made.II.    He recalled that, at the meeting of theCabinet referred to above, it had been decided   to reserve the question of whether the proposed staff conversations should take place between the Air Staffsalone or should be extended to the Army General Staffs.The Foreign Office favoured the extension on the groundthat the moment the Conversations between the Air Staffsstarted, there would be a demand for their extension to the Army as well,IIIo     The question of whether the conversations should also be extended to the Belgian Government whohad made approaches on the subject and were entitled toa reply.The Foreign Secretary suggested that the communication referred to in I. ought not to be made
illuntil a decision had. been taken as to the scope of theStaff Conversations.     He said that Mr, Churchill had strongly urged Naval Conversations, particularly inregard to the Mediterranean     He himself, however, felt-that Conversations relating to the Mediterranean shouldhe reserved in the present state of the negotiations withItalycThe First Lord of the Admiralty strongly agreed with this.The Prime Minister said he had been givingconsiderable thought to this matter.     He recalled the reluctance of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee andcertain Government Departments in the past to agree to staff Conversations0      It had been with a good deal ofhesitation that they had been induced to agree toConversations more or less sub rosa between Air Attaches.To him it seemed to be an anomalous position that theGovernment should have accepted obligations and taken no steps to make them goodo     He could not reconcile theacceptance of such obligations with the frequentrejection of French approaches which only meant that our action would not be decided until the emergency arose.His opinion in this matter had been reinforced by what had happened in Austria0      In modern warfare, the aggressor was able to move with such rapidity that therewas no time for making plans.     He thought, therefore,that all concerned would be easaer in their minds if eachknew what part the other could play,,     Pie was glad to hear that the Foreign Office were willing to extend the conversations.     He had heard one suggestion that therecent decisions on the RSle of the Army rendered staff conversations particularly undesirableo     He asked himself,however, whether it was right to keep the French in the
dark.     To him it seemed disloyal to the French and unfair to ourselves to do so.      If the French were hound toreceive a shock sooner or later, surely the sooner the&quot;better?     He thought, however, that the Chiefs of Staffought not to he asked to engage in Conversations withoutclear instructions as to their scope.     His own view was thatthe best opportunity for opening such Conversations wouldbe at a Conference between the two Governments to be heldfin   ^roinca^.as soon as there was a stable Government^      If a proposalfor Conversations was made by us at an early stage of sucha Conference, he thought that the satisfaction of french ministers would go some way to mitigate a statement whichmight be made later as to the limitations of the co-operation we could give, especially on land.     before making such communication, however, it would be necessaryto reach decisions not only as to the extent of the Forceswe could employ, but as to the area to which the conversations were to apply.     He understood fromMr. Churchill that the French plans contemplated holdingthe Maginot Lines and, at the same time, to undertakeoffensive operations in another area (which he mentioned).That seemed to suggest an extension of the Conversations tothe Navy and to the Mediterranean.     He thought the best plan would be to refer the whole question to the Committeeof Imperial Defence (Planning) for examination and report,and, in the meanwhile, to reserve the decision as to thedate of the communication as to the Role of the Army.     Asto Naval Conversations, apart from the question of theMediterranean, it seemed to him probable that in a war withGermany, Anglo-French trade would be liable to attack in all parts of the world.     He thought, therefore, that the conversations ought to extend to the Admiralty and the
inMinistry of Marine, who might take alternative assumptionsaccording as Italy took part in the war or not0      He favoured a frank communication to the German Government on the subject.The Secretary of State for Air welcomed thePrime Minister5s proposals.     Staff Conversations were very important from the point of view of the Royal AirForce, and he proposed to ask the Air Staff to work outthe sort of instructions they would like to have0The Secretary of State for War said that theChiefs of Staff had in the past been opposed toconversations and the General Staff were still opposed.Summarising their objections, he pointed out that nearly all of them were politicalo     If they had been made on military grounds, he would have supported them, but hethought that the Cabinet had to take its decision onwider grounds of policy.     He suggested that if the matter were referred once more to the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, they should be asked to take as a basis thatthe Cabinet had decided the matter and wanted their views.The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested thatit was impossible to exclude the Mediterranean from thescope of Naval Gonversatjons.After some further discussion, the cabinet agreed:(a) To approve in principle that the proposed conversations between the British andFrench Air Staffs should be extended to theNaval Staffs and the Army Staffs and shouldnot be limited to the channel of service attaches:(b) That the questions of the scope of the staff conversations and the Forces and areas towhich they should apply, should be remitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence, whichshould meet with the limited personnelsummoned for consideration of Defence Plans;(c) That the date of the proposed communication to the French Government of the decisionsof the Cabinet on the Role of the army should be postponed until after the investigation referred to in (b) above:- IS -
(d)   That if the Prime Minister or theMinister for Co-ordination of defence should invite the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee to prepare a report to theCommittee of Imperial Defence on thesubject, it should be made clear thattheir deliberations are to be basedon the decision recorded in (a) above.
(d)   That if the Prime Minister or theMinister for Co-ordination of defence should invite the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee to prepare a report to theCommittee of Dmperial Defence on thesubject, it should be made clear thattheir deliberations are to be basedon the decision recorded in (a) above.
THE AIRPROGRAMME.proposals forAccelerationof-(previous reference:Cabinet 16(39), Con-el us ion 2.)Se8. The Cabinet had before them the following Mosteret documents on the subject of Proposals forAcceleration of the Air Programme:-A Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (CP.-86 (38))reviewing the steps he had. taken onthe question following upon Cabinetdiseussions, and attaching a Memo-memorandum by the Secretary of State forAir submitting and. explaining his proposed expansion an^ accelerationscheme &quot;L&quot; (first-line strength plus the reserves put forward under SchemeK), which the Secretary of State, onthe advice of the Air Staff, regardedas necessary to provide a. safe air defence against Germanyc    The Minister,in submitting the Secretary of State&apos;programme for a decision by the Cabinet,pointed out the impossibility of bringingScheme L within the Cabinet decision on defence Expenditure, namely,  1,570millions for the three Defence Depert-ments over the years 1937-41, and. hoped,that any additional expenditure, ifapproved, would not be regarded, as re-opening the Cabinet&apos;s decision as tothe sum ava.ilable:A Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP.-87 (38))   commenting onC.Po-86 (38) and. the Secretary of Statefor Air&apos;s Memorandum attached thereto,and adducing arguments in support of hissubmission that the Cabinet should not approve Scheme L, but that, the AirMinistry should, be as ken to plan as rapidly as possible a further expansionof the Metropolitan Air Force which would,go beyond. Scheme F (the Scheme at present authorised) but which would not involvethe extremely serious  commitments ofS cheme L.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence beganby reminding the Cabinet of the various schemes of air defence that had been submitted, viz:-Scheme   F   - approved by the Cabinet and inforce to-day.Scheme   J   - put forward by the Air Staff as theminimum Scheme essential for security.Cost,  over  600 millions in 5 years.This had been rejected as tooexpensive,/
Scheme    K   - Cost,  567 millions in 5 years.    It hadnot been possible to reconcile thisScheme with the decision of the Cabinetthat the total expenditure of theServices over 5 years should be limitedto  1,570 millions,  without reducing theother Services below the limits of security.When the Cabinet had asked him to ration theServices down to  1,570 millions,  he had suggested somefigures as a basis for consideration,  and for the AirMinistry he had suggested     505 millions,  that is to say,about  60 millions below Scheme K*    Just after that theAustrian crisis had arisen,  and the Cabinet took a decision in favour of acceleration of the Air Force and Anti-aircraft defences.    He had then approached the Service departments with a view to clarifying the situation.    The Secretary ofState for Air had replied that he was not clear as to whatwas expected of him, but had suggested a new Scheme known asScheme L,  which involved both an acceleration of approvedprogrammes and a slight expansion of Scheme K.    the praticability of this Scheme depended upon an immediatesupply of additional labour,  which the Secretary of State had estimated at 100,000 men,  a proportion of which was to beskilled.    He had felt that approval of that Scheme fellbeyond his authority and he and the Secretary of State forAir had agreed to submit the issue to the Cabinet.    SchemeL would involve an expenditure somewhat in excess of SchemeK,  and would therefore wreck the rationing scheme unless itwere to involve reductions in naval and military expenditure,which could not be contemplated.    The Secretary of State forAir was advised that Scheme L was essential to meet theGerman menace,  and that if it could not be approved,  itwould not suffice merely to cut off some part ofit,    but the Air Staff would   have   to
consider the whole strategic plan afresh.    He himself had therefore suggested tentatively that the total sum of 1.570 millions might he increased by some addition to theallotment to the Air Ministry.    The question arose, however,as to whether, even if Scheme K or Scheme L were adopted,  itwas possible to carry out the programme.    After making enquiries he was now satisfied that it was impossible toobtain any sudden and rapid increase of labour.    The increase would be slow and spread over months.The Prime Minister pointed out that the question ofsome increase in the sum of  505 millions must have arisenapart from the Austrian crisis owing to the disparity betweenthe British and German figures for coming years.    The cabinet might have had to decide that there was a point beyond which expenditure on the Services could not be taken without too great a general weakening of the nation.    He then put thefollowing three questions:-(l)   Had the Secretary of State for Air a plan for an Air Force Programme within the 505 millions contemplated in the proposedrationing for the Air Ministry?    In that eventhow much less security would it give thanScheme L?(2)   Supoosing the proposal of the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence was adopted,  to add to the aggregate of  1,570 millions anadditional sum for the Air Ministry,and assuming that the programme was carried outby (say) March,  1940, how would our positionthen compare with that of Germany?   He gathered that we should still be some distance fromparity, and he suggested that we could notachieve parity without compulsory serviceand throwing over financial considerations.(3)    If we could not achieve parity with Germany,could we produce a formidable offensive forcewhile carrying out a programme   designedto strengthen our defensive strength so that weshould not be at the&quot; mercy of a foreign Power?
The Secretary of State for Air thanked the PriimeMinister for his questions, which would help him-He thought the best way of dealing with the Airissue would he to sive a general appreciation., into which he would introduce the answers to the various questions that had been raised.He had been asked in the course of the discussionwhat was the bomber strength of Germany and the   UnitedKingdom (Metropolitan)      ..,r the ores err: time *   his reply was,GERMANY., between 1080 to lo50 bomber? 0He could not say exactly how fax the;/ had got towardsthe la11er figure.THE UNIT El) KINGDOM, over 800.The latter figure included many machines that couldonly operate effectively from French territory, andthe reserves were inadeauate,.Oomins to his general appreciation, the Secretaryof State said that he had assumed that the intentionof the Cabinet was to secure the most adequate air defence possible in the shorxest time.   ife had announced our intention to increase the Air Force andthe Anti-aircraft programmes and to accelerate theircompletion,  even though it involved some interferencewith industry and a concentration of labour and materialon Defence.    It was obviously impossible to accomplishthis within the rationing scheme proposed by theMinister for Co-ordination^ which the Cabinet onlyagreed to before the Austrian crisis, and e^en then only tentatively and subject to review in the lightof full information as to what the results would be.He emphasised that to meet the German menace and to accelerate, whether to the extent of       per cento or70 per cent., we must work to a plan and a.- time-table.-17-
As to the plan, he assured the Cabinet that it  couldnot be less than the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s owncriterion, given long before the Austrian crisis,namely, on November 1st., when Sir John Simon haddefined the objective as being &quot;To create and maintain an Air Force which will form an effective deterrentand insurance for peace, and which, in the unhappyevent of war, woul^ be able to meet a potential enemy on equal terms&quot;,    ^he only possible insurance involved(a.) a Defence Force objectively framed to meet anexpected scale of attack, that is to say. FighterSqua.drons on the scale of Scheme &quot;K&quot;, which no-one had disputed.   4b) Anti-aircraft complementarydefences;    and ( c), a Counter-Offensive Force.The Cabinet must appreciate two points that had.been before them in Air Staff Papers since the presentreview began early last October, namely, first, theextent of the German menace, and, second, the limitedcharacter of his present proposals.   He emphasisedthis because the Minister for Co-ordination had. saidthat. Scheme &quot;L&quot; -would, in the opinion of the Air Staff,produce a. safe air defence against Germany.    Injustice to the /ir Staff he vres boun^ to say that itwould not.     The Air Staff had repeatedly pointed outthat, they had ta%en as their basis the minimum knownGerman intentions which would be realised this year.He could not say exactly how far the Germans  could go,but it  coul^ be assumed for a certainty that, theywould reach the -figure of l^SO, as the Germans, a^terincreasing the size of their squadrons from 9 to 13aeroplanes, were now known to be increasing them to1^.    The Germans, however,  could, an^ probably would,go beyond 13^0 machines, as they were able to use theconscription of man-power and of industry. . The Air-18-
noStaff therefore thought it p-^obahle that Germany would go beyond 1350.    They had only taken into accountthose bombers which could reach the United Kingdom.There were in addition, o^ course, la^ge numbers ofs ho-rt-range machines, and great numbers of Array co-operation squadrons which could not do this.Finally, to meet the financial stringency, theAir Staff had deliberately put forward a scale of reserves below whQt they considered a proper insurance.Reinforcements for our squadrons overseas had ^een cutout of the Air Force proposal by the Cabinet.   He didnot object to that, but the curtailments had been much greater than that, and the Air Ministry had been told that they must not exceed the -figures approved .Consequently Scheme &quot;L&quot; -was a minimum, dictated not by what the Air Staff considered, would give safety froma strategical point of view, but by political consider-ations of what was possible without  control andNat ional Servi ce .The situation became still worse when the Frenchposition was taken into account,    ^he Committee ofImperia.1 Defence would have before them a. Paper onthis subject at its Meeting on the following daywhich would show how bad the French position was.He insisted that we could not adopt anything less thanScheme &quot;L&quot;.    The criticism ought to be &quot;Cannot you get.that Scheme completed more rapidly?&quot;   Thereasonswhy we must have a definite plan at leaston the scale of Scheme &quot;L&quot; were the following.:-^1) Politically any+hing less was a confessionof complete and permanent inferiority.(S) The recent  change of policy away from&quot;business as usual&quot; meant an effectiveeffort,(3) Strategically and industrially we mustwork to a certain plan.
Strategically the Air Force must be properlybalanced.   At this point, his answer to the PrimeMinister&apos;s first question was in the negative.    Scheme&quot;F&quot; had been conceived as a strategic whole. Fighters,Bombers, general reconnaissance machines, etc.    mheCabinet were, o^ course, entitled to say that theycould not find the money to carry out. a scheme, butthey could not make the programme for the Air Force.If they could not accept one scheme, they must ask for another to be produced which was within their means.The Air Force, therefore,  could not accept that thecharacter o^&quot; the Force should be dictated to them,but the Air Staff must decide its character and composition.Industrially the orders must be placed, to cover along period.   That principle had. been accepted, since1935.   They must have a clear notice of eighteen months to cover gaps in production.    It was impossible to getfirms and labour to go &quot;all-out&quot; if working to a deadend .   For this reason it vras impossible to improviserapidly.    It was possible to slow down, owing to the break Clause, but not to increase rapidly.In this  connection he said that it was impossibleto take the risk of further reviews before starting anew programme.    The present, review had. started, in theprevious June, and. a little after the Air Ministry had asked for reconsideration of the policy of no inter-ference with industry.    They had expanded, the profes-sional an^ shadow factories to take the present strain-e-f labour^ avail able./ In recruiting, training, aerodromes and stations it was impossible to improvise.   ;Ve oughtto execute our plans now.    mhe Air Ministry would use
i 90all possible economies - temporary buildings; additions to schools, both Service and Civil:    the use of CivilAerodromes, etc:    but over the whole field of personnel,training of industry,  etc., we should be deceivingourselves and others if we pretended that we could, speedup or act later if we postponed action now.   He contend-ed. that now was the time;    but in any case quick action was impossible later unless orders were given and action taken now.He pointed out that the Chancellor of the Exchequerargued that we should do less than this minimum of insurance on three groundso   First, because he maintain-ed that the labour reinforcement of 100,000 men wouldnot be forthcoming, so we ought to attempt less and take longer over it.      Tt was impossible to assume that labour woul^ not be forthcoming.    The aircraft industry had been planned to take the strain.   We ought not to try -Tor less than the maximum we could achieve.    Tflabour was not forthcoming sufficiently rapidly we mightget further behind, but we ought not to be content withsome lesser aim.mhe Chancellor7s second reason was that the AirStaff would do better to make a smaller but more efficient fight ins force.   He himself asked that theAir Force should have discretion to build, up and usemen and machines in the most effective way, and thatthis should not be a. fictitious first-line strengthwithout reserves.    This, however, did not diminish theaggregate demand   and the need for first-line strengthplus reserves by the Spring of 1940, or as near to thatas we could get.The Chancellor&apos;s third point was finance, and hehad suggested that the cost was under-estimated., he himself did not believe that the cost would materially
exceed  567 millions. Past estimates had proved fairlygood.The Minister of Labour interpolated at thispoint that if labour had to be gi^en lodging allowancesit would increase the cost.The Secretary of State for Air adhered to his general view that there would be no considerableincreases.      Most of the labour- would probably be foundlocally.      But even if there was to be some increase in cost,  it did not seem a reason for not trying to make anadequate Air Force.The Chancellor&apos;s next reason was that the moneycould not be foxmd.      Ke pointed out, hov/ever,  thatthere was a  28 millions surplus this year.      Theproposed accelerated expansion night be an insurance for peace.      He himself believed that it was the onlyinsurance.      Without it we could not live to use our resources.     What he asked for was not the idea, but,given sufficient labour, we could carry it out, and he urged that the Cabinefs duty was to decide to do it.He then answered the Prime Minister&apos;s second question, namely, as to the position two years hence,  ifthe money were allocated for Scheme &quot;L&quot; and Germany wentahead as fast as possible?     At the moment we were in aweak position, but the new machines were turning out very well, both as regards Fighters and Bombers.      We shouldhave fewer machines than Germany, but in two years&apos; time we should be relatively stronger.    The real danger time was&apos;/
Given double shifts, and taking every consideration.into account, he was certain that we should be betteroff than todsy.    &quot;&quot;here were certain limitations tothe German expansion, not so much industrially as in personnel.    When pressed on the subject, he adhered to his position that we should be relatively betteroff in two years&apos;  time than we were today, givenScheme &quot;L&quot; and the necessary labour.Tn reply to the Prime Minister&apos;s third questionhe said that we should not be e.t the mercy of Germany.Our strength might he inferior, but we should be ina better position than we would otherw-ise; if Scheme&quot;L&quot; were approved.   We should not be at the mercy ofGermany       as it might be said we were today and we should possess a strong deterrent.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed outthat this was a question that had to be approached fromthe point of view of every member of the Cabinet havingresponsibility for the decision and not from that of a department,     He sympathised with the point of view putforward by the Secretary of State for Air.     He himself had two main points;    first, the essential principle was to preserve    the financial strength of the country.When people spoke of cutting their cloth to suit theirfigure, he himself was prepared to provide cloth at theexpense of the taxpayer, but it must be recognised thatthere was a limitation &apos;:o the public purse;    second, thequestion was as to what was the best method of meeting this very dangerous situation?     With regard to the first point, everyone recognised that finance was one of the greatfactors in Defence.      He recalled that the Prime Minister.,when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, had reached theconclusion that  1500 millions was the maximum sum thatwe could afford.     Now we had had to tell the country that that figure must be increased, and Sir ThomasInskip&apos;s investigation had resulted in it  being raised to  1650 millions.       In the middle of F^oruary, theCabinet decided that that was the abso&quot;^te maximum.     Nowthey were asked to increase it.     Devence expenditure had increased from  160 millions in lP3o-7 to  263 millions in 1937-8 to  343 millions in the coming Budget;    and,  inthe next two years, it would probably be greater still.These figures could not be   reached unless we turnedourselves into a different kind of nation.     Germany, forexample, had got rid of her war debt;    had not such goodsocial services as we; controlled wages and couldenforce loans.     The standard of living was also lower
than ourso     We could net do those things.      Consequently,there was a strict limit to our expenditure.     He did not say that the position was necessarily satisfactorybecause we had a sound system of finance.     He had to admit that a knock-out blow would knock us out $ust aseasily as if that were not the case.      On the other hand,if we could resist a knock-out blow, we should possess an outstanding advantage thereafter.      Coming to his second point, he was terribly concerned about the financial situation, but that was not his only concern-.     Out of our800 bombers, he gathered, that only 400 were capable of full mobilisation0The Secretary of State for Air recalled thatthe Cabinet had decided that we should put our money intofirst-line strength.      That meant that until reservesbecame available, half our force had to be used as reserves.That made it impossible for us to go to war at present.The Chancellor of the Exchequer doubted whetherthe method proposed was right.      On the proposal that theGovernment ought to work to and maintain a plan, he pointed out,that this had notbeen done.       First, we had adoptedScheme F and then a year ago, the Secretary of state proposed Scheme H.The Secretary of State for Air said that thatwould not involve an increase in numbers.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that   nextScheme K had been before the Cabinet   when they had decided on  1650 millions, and the Cabinet found itimpossible to accept it owing to the costo     Scheme L,however, would cost more than Scheme K.      He raised,  for
1971    a consideration, whether Scheme L was the best way to dealwith   a   situation in v/hich the existing plans could notbe carried out up to time.     He realised the advantageof long range programmes.     He did not attach much importance, however, to the Break Clause because, althoughthat might involve some saving on actual machines, therewere, in addition, the aerodromes and buildings whichwere not covered by the Break Clause.     That was why hehad made the following suggestion in paragraph 14 of cp. 87 (38):-&quot;We ought, I think, most seriously to considerwhether the sounder and more business-likeplan is not that we should now organise a smaller degree of expansion, within the limits of the resources which a re in sight.&quot;It would be better to adopt the sound business methodof not expanding the business until we were in a positionto do so.
The First Lord of the Admiralty urged the danger of taking up the demands of one Service at a time.    He recalled that last May his predecessor had put certain proposalsfor a new standard of naval defence before the defence plans (Policy) Committee.    The Imperial Conference had been impressed by the need for this plan.    No decision had beentaken as yet.    The matter was urgent for the reason thatthe ratios suggested by Sir Thomas Inskip were inadequate for even the D.R.C. Fleet.    The danger was that the country might get three defence Services,  all inadequate.    It mightbe better to concentrate on one Service and run risks withthe others.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster pointedout that there was no House of Commons pressure on theAdmiralty comparable to that exerted on the Air Ministry-Members were demanding to know how the Prime Minister&apos;declaration was to be implemented.The Prime Minister pointed out that this was avery difficult question for decision by the whole Cabinet,the more so that the recommendation before them was not an agreed one.    He had thought it right that the cabinet should hear all sides of the question.    Before reachingtheir decision, however, he thought it would be useful to theCabinet if some investigation took place by a smaller body,which he then proposed-The Cabinet agreed:-That the proposals for the acceleration and expansion of the Royal Air Force should beconsidered by the following Ministers:-The Prime Minister.^ The Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.The Secretary of State for Air.who should endeavour to prepare a recommendation for the Cabinet at their next regular weekly meeting.

As a first-step the Secretaries of State for Var andAir should be invite^ to a&amp;certain a-ndreport on the present position as regardsthe training of apprentices by munitions and aircraft firms respectively.&quot;The Minister for Co-ordination of Defencereported that the Minister of Labour had asked that action to give effect to conclusion (b) of the Committeeof Imperial Defence should be postponed, as it would cut across the discussions which had now been inauguratedwith Trade Unions and employers.The Minister of Labour said he attached some importance to this,t The Secretary of State for Air said that hehad already taken the necessary action which, however,did not affect the negotiations to which the Minister of
Labour had referred.     He had ascertained that in factmanufacturers were doing a good deal in training apprentices.He undertook, however, not to pursue his enquiries indetail pending the present conversations,The Cabinet took note of the Memorandum by theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence (C*P. 84 (38)) and agreed that no action should be taken for the present togive effect to conclusion (b) above, pending the present negotiations with representatives of Trade Unions andemployerso
10.  The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of Air Raid Precautions andthe Protection of Vital Services:-A Memorandum by the Home Secretary(CP.-80 (38)) recalling that at theMeeting mentioned in the margin theCabinet had accepted the principle ofa Government contribution towardsexpenditure by public utility under-taking s on air raid precautionsadditional to those falling on industry generally, and stating that the HopkinsCommittee he.d recommended, grants,broadly speaking, of 50 per cent, of approved expenditure.    Tn his Memo-randum the Home Secretary favoured ascheme under which grant would belimited to undertakings in a certainnumber of areas selected for their importance from a Defence, point ofview, provided it was not presented a.s the Governments complete and. final solution of the public utilities&apos; problem.Considerable controversy would arise overthe proposed geographical limitation of grant, which he thought could only be successfully dealt with on lines sug-gested. at the end of his Memorandum:The following draft Conclusions (CcP.-8B(38)) of a Conference of Ministers heldon April 4th, which had considered theabove-mentioned Memorandum by the HomeSecretary:-&quot;(a) That the suggestions of the HomeSecretary for dealing with theproblem outlined in paragraph 3(a) to (f) inclusive of C.P.-80(38) should be accepted in principle.(b)    That the necessary legislation should,not attempt, to define the a.reas geo-graphically or otherwise than by reference to three factors, viz:(l) size and. density of population(2) vulnerability(3) production and supply of munitions.It should be clearly indicated thatthe Government proposed to deal in thefirst instance with certain areas whichare of urgent importance from the pointof view of defence.While it would be understood thatthe measures to be taken would notnecessarily be the same in all areas,care should be taken not to create the impression at the outset that themeasures to be taken in the less vulnerable areas would be the same in kind and. in extent as those to be takenin the first selected areas.
( o) That the Bill should not specify the selected areas hut that the responsible ministers should be given full discre-tion to decide as to areas to be given priority under the arrangements.(d) That if the Government were pressed, fordetails of the arrangements and. theareas, the reply should be to theeffect that the information was confi-dential and that it would, be contraryto the public interest to disclose it.(e) That, provision should be made in theBill for grants to public utility undertakings on the basis of   for  and that every effort should be madeto obtain agreement on this basis inadvance by negotiation with the under-takings. If, however, in the courseof the negotiations some adjustment of the   for   basis is found, necessary,the Chancellor of the Exchequer, theHome Secretary and the Minister of health should be authorised to make the a.djust-ment *(f) That the Bill should contain provisionsempowering the Government, in the last resort, to exercise compulsion in thecase of recalcitrant undertakings.&quot;After hearing a verbal report by theChancellor of the Exchequer, who had taken the Chair atthe Conference of Ministers referred to above, theCabinet agreed:(a) To approve the recommendations set forth above:(b) That the Secretary of State for scotland should be kept in touch with the developments of this question and shouldbe added to the Ministers concerned inthe adjustment in conclusion  e) above.
