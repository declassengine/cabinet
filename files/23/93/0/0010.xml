TH15! KING&apos; birthday.ForeignOfficeDinner.(previous reference:Cabinet 22(38). Con-clusion 11 ,)2.   With reference to the Conclusion mentionedin the margin, the Prime Minister informed theCabinet that the Foreign Office had now fixed the evening of June 15th for the Dinner to be given atthe Foreign Office to the Diplomatic Representativeso  foreign Governments in London on the occasion ofHis Majesty&apos;s birthday.    The Secretary of State forForeign affairs.irs had asked him to mention this date to the Cabinet and to express his hope that as manyCabinet Ministers as possible would find it eonveni-ent to attend the Dinner.
2G1FOREIGN 30      The Prime Minister enquired whether anyAFFAIRS.Members of the Cabinet desired information in regard3 to any general aspects of foreign affairs.German- Following an enquiry, the Prime MinisterItalianRelations. said that at present no definite and reliable(previous information was available as to the results of recentReference:Cabinet 22(38) discussions between Herr Hitler and Signor MussoliniConclusion 6)at Rome.     The views taken in France were convenientlysummarised in telegram No. 298 of the 5th May, 1938,from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris.Prance: The attention of the Cabinet was drawn toRecentconversations     the most secret telegram Noe 8 of the 5th May from the with.Government of the Union of South Africa criticising(previous reference: the attitude which the French Ministers had adopted in cabinet 22 (38)Conclusion 2)      their recent conversations in London with the PrimeMinister and the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs which, in the view of the Government of the Union ofSouth Africa, was&quot;most disappointing and disturbingand if persisted in must spell disaster to Europe&quot;.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs had reason to believe that General Hertzog was theinspirer if not the author of this telegram,andreminded the Cabinet of General Hertzog&apos;s tendencyhastily to jump at conclusions often on insufficientdata.      It appeared from the telegram that general hertzog was under the impression that, as a result ofthe discussions in question, the French Ministers had succeeded in persuading the Prime Minister and theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs to adopt theFrench point of view.      It would be very easy to reassure General Hertzog on this point by telling him that the conversations had resulted in acceptance bythe French Ministers of the British point of view onall the more important issues0
9^960 6The Lord Chancellor said that he had obtained a general impression from the information received from paris that the French were not disinclined to embark ona preventive war.The Prime Minister said that, while this mightbe the view of a certain French section, he was quite satisfied after his conversations with M. Daladier andM. Bonnet that public opinion generally in France wouldbe opposed to any policy of military adventure.     france might indeed go so far as to mobilise but only if she had first been gravely provoked.Jentral In reply to an enquiry, the Prime Ministertarope:iaecho-Slovakia. said that there was nothing as yet definite andfevious authoritative   in regard to the probable reactions ofiefererce:(atone t 22 (38) the Government of Czecho-Slovakia to the recent Anglo-lonclusion 3.), -French representations on the subject of the Sudeten Germans.     Such information as had been received was-indefinite and speculative.
4.  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C.P.-118 (38)) on the question of assisting Turkey to buy warships to the value of about  6 millions inthis country.    Turkey also wished to obtain, withthe help of the Export Credits Guarantee Department ,credits for at lea.st  10 millions for industrial purposes .   Unfortunately the security which theTurkish Government could offer was inadequate tosupport credits extending to  16 millions in all:nevertheless the Secretary of State was convinced.that, for the reasons given in his Memorandum, theywere essential on political grounds.   He added, thatno legislation would be necessary for the industrialcredits, but a special Act of Parliament (the formof which he outlined.) would be necessary for the warships  credit, since the Export Guarantees Actdid. not extend to &quot;munitions of war&quot; .The Prime Minister said that, in theabsence of the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs at Geneva, he wished to explain the proposals contained in cp 112 (38)o      It should be notedat the outset that these proposals involved a gravedeparture from precedent and from the policy whichsuccessive British Governments had long adopted inthe case of similar applications from foreigncountries.     If the proposals were accepted, theywould have to be most carefully watched so that thefuture position might be safeguardedo     The ideaunderlying the Secretary of State?s recommendationswas that we should use our financial strength and resources for political purposes,,The proposals fell under two headings -(l)   The granting to Turkey, with the help of the Export Credits Guarantee Department,of credits for the sum of  10 millions for industrial purposes;    and- 5 -
(2)   The granting to Turkey of financial assistanceto enable her to buy warships to the value ofabout  6 millions in this country.With regard to the first proposal, it should be observedthat this could be implemented under the ordinaryExport Credits Guarantee procedure without special legislation.      There was a definite difference of opinon as to whether the  10 millions would ever be repaid by turkey.     The Treasury took the view that repayment was unlikely.     On the other hand, the Export credits guarantee Department,which had long and valuableexperience of business of this character, thought that themoney would be repaid, and the Department&apos;s view was   ^supported by the Vae9-Chairman of Barclj.y&apos;s. Bank^ whohad expressed the opinion that the risks involved were no greater than those which would be undertaken by CommercialHouses in the City.It should be observed that the  10 millionscredits were to be used for the development of Turkey&apos;.s&quot;/Ac*^     C*J-trii&amp;et-   &apos;/L^o     C^c^LS^LSL-industrial resources and that -&amp;rea t Dritain-mlgh-t&apos; we 1-3-expect -to derive indirect bonefits-from ouch duvDlupuiLUil.On the whole, he (the Prime Minister) had reached theconclusion that this was a reasonable risk to take andone which might prove remunerative.     As the cabinet were aware, the Export Credits Guarantee Department had,as a result of their successful operations over manyyears, accumulated a substantial surplus and if thisTurkish credit of  10 millions was repaid,  this surpluswould be increased by about  1 million0     In reaching his conclusion, he had been influenced by the optimisticviews taken by the Export Credits Guarantee department and by the fact that that Department was particularlyqualified by ability, experience and success to make a correct estimate of the risks involved.
0 I)The second proposal-to find  6 millions toenable Turkey to buy warships in this country- was on anentirely different footing.     There was no one who could say with confidence that we should ever againsee this money.     Here, however, entered the very powerfulpolitical arguments set out in the Secretary   of State*bmemorandum and, if the arguments for and against wereweighed up, there must be placed against the possible lossof  6 millions, the  prospect of our being opposed in somegrave emergency by a Power whose intervention on the sideof our opponents might well prove a decisive factor.As an ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer, henaturally disliked the proposal and was apprehensive ofthe precedent which it would establish.     There were many other countries which, when our action in regard to turkey was known, would make claims for similar treatment.At the same time, it must be remembered that Turkey was in a very special and exceptional position.     Sheconstituted a very real bulwark against German expansion in the Near and Middle East.     Turkey should never havebeen allowed to have allied herself with Germany in theGreat War and, in present circumstances, we ought to take every care to avoid a repetition of that mistake.     Aftercarefully weighing up the arguments for and against theproposals, he (the Prime Minister) had come to theconclusion that the recommendation of the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs in regard to the  6 millionscredit was right and should be accepted.The Ministers who had discussed the questionrecently had considered whether it might not be possibleto effect some reduction of  16 millions but the general opinion had been that if it were decided to depart fromstrictly orthodox financial practice in this matter, itwould be a mistake to risk spoiling the ship for a
ha&apos;porth of tar, as by refusing to advance the whole 16 millions, we should only drive the Turks into applying to Germany for the difference between that sum and thesum which we ourselves were prepared to offer.Accordingly, the Ministers in question had decided torecommend the Cabinet to adopt the proposals in totoincluding the figure of  16 millions.As the Cabinet would observe,  the credit of 6 millions for armaments purchases would require legislation.      It might be expected that this would giverise to some difficulty, but there could be little doubtthat attainment of the object in view would be well worthsome Parliamentary trouble.     The Government would haveto be prepared to face Parliamentary criticism.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he agreed with the Prime Minister in all respects.      TheCabinet would appreciate the financial enormity of thestep   which was contemplated and would realise that itwas one which could not be repeated.     In his opinion,if we were able to obtain our political desiderata, itwould be very cheap at this price, but it must berealised that we were taking a very novel and a very important step.     His advisers were disposed to regard the proposals as a grave departure from financialrectitude and prudence*      They had warned him that inany case Turkey would find it very difficult to repay the advances without upsetting the exchange andprejudicing the normal trade between the two countries.The Turks, who were addicted to bargaining would, nodoubt, be greatly gratified and surprised to find thatthey were going to be granted all that they asked for.A possible alternative procedure in regard to the 6 millions for armaments would have been to remove thepresent statutory prohibition which prevented export
credits being given for armaments.     There were,however, grave Parliamentary and other objections tothis course and it had, therefore, seemed best to treat the Turkish case specially and in isolation.The Secretary of State for India supported the proposals very strongly.     He reminded the Cabinetthat some time ago he had put forward a similarproposal in regard to Afghanistan.     There had been some difficulty, but the Export Credits guarantee department had been able to arrange industrial creditsand as the United Kingdom Government had been unable toarrange credits for munitions, the Government of india had stepped into the breach and provided Afghanistanwith the financial facilities which she desired forthis purpose.The First Lord of the Admiralty and theSecretary of State for War expressed themselves infavour of the proposals0The President of the Board of Trade informed the Cabinet that as he himself had been unable to be present at the meeting of Ministers mentioned in thefirst paragraph of cp 112 (38), he had been represented by the Secretary to the Department of overseas Trade.      In his view, the political considerations must, in this case, outweigh thecommercial and financial considerations.     At the sametime, he thought it unlikely that we should, in fact,obtain repayment of our money and if we made a gift to turkey, this should be at the expense of the generaltaxpayer and not of the Anglo-Turkish clearing.The Secretary of State for Air informed theCabinet that the Air Ministry and the Air Staff had very close relations with Turkey and had found a very strong and general desire on the part of the Turks towork most closely with us and to treat us in a very- 9 -
different fashion from the way in which they treated otherforeigners.The Lord Chancellor suggested that perhaps the Foreign Office would consider whether this was amatter v/hich, under the Anglo-Italian Agreement, we oughtto bring to the notice of Count Ciano0The Prime Minister agreed that the ForeignOffice should consider this aspect of the matter.The Cabinet agreeas(a) That, as proposed by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs inCoP. 112 (38), the necessary steps should be taken for the grant to turkey of credits for at loaot 10 millions for industrial purposes and a further credit of 6 millions for armaments purchases,subject to the conclusion   of AND^^uj^a-t^       agreement to^aiBprove the position ofthe Anglo-Turkish clearing on thelines already under discussion withthe Economic Mis sion;(b) To take note that, while nolegislation woul-.. be necessary forthe industrial credits, a specialAct of Parliament would be requiredfor the warship   credits:(c) To invite the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to consider thequestion whether the decision to grant the     credits mentioned in (a) above to Turkey should be notified to theItalian Government.
2G9PORTUGAL.Supply ofWar Materielto.(previous reference:Cabinet 17(38), Con-clusion 13 .)F.R -3/ ($4 )/0.5 . The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (CP.-113(38)) to which he attached a Report by the Chiefs ofStaff Sub-committee (D.P.R.-267) as to the possibili-ty of providing the types and number of artilleryequipments required, by Portugal.   A suggestion had.been ma.de that token deliveries might be made at acomparatively e?rly date and that the rest of therequirements should ^e  completed with due regard, tothe other commitments of U.M. Government and to ourown requirements.   Under certain assumptions it waspossible to make a token delivery of 4 equipments of3.7&quot; guns early in 1939, with completion of the totalof 35 at the rate of 3 jer month thereafter, and 4equipments of 3.45&quot; at the end of 1939, with bulkdeliveries at the rate of 12 a months beginning inJune. 1940.    The Var Office, however, were strongly of opinion that the existing policy of giving the air defences of Great britain priority over everythingelse, so far as 1939 at least was  concerned, should stand, that only a token delivery of 4 3.7&quot; shouldhe promised in 1939, and 4 3.45&quot; per month from June,1940. to the end Qf the yecr, with three times that amount in 1941.    If it was decided to offer to providePortugal with 3.7&quot; and 3.45&quot; guns on the above condi-tions as to delivery, with easy terms of payment(which latter v,ould require legislation)  it waspossible that Portugal would agree to take herrequirements f-om the United kingdom instead of fromGermany *The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence outlined the present position and explained that at a meetingof representatives of all the Departments concerned.including the Treasury, on May 9th, it had been agreed-11-
to examine how far we could go towards meetingPortuguese requirements .   The results of this exam-ination were set out in his Memorandum f CP.-113 (38)) ,It would, he observed, that as regards the 3.7&quot;guns the position was as follows:-&quot;No delivery can he made up to the endof this present year, but on the aboveassumptions a. token delivery of 4 equip-ments might, be released early in 1939.The balance of the Portuguese requirement of 3 6 could be met by deliveries pro-eeeding thereafter at. the rate of 3 per month.&quot; The War Office, however, arestronely of opinion that the existing policy of giving the air defences ofGreat Britain priority over everythingelse, so far as 1939 at least is con-cerned, should stand, and that only a token delivery of 4 guns should bepromised, in 1939 .    Tn 1940, on the otherhand, there should, be no great diffi-culty in arranging for the completionof the total of 36.&quot;As regards 3*4C;&quot; guns there was no possibilityof deliveries commencing before the end of 1939 .It would, then be possible to offer a token delivery of, say, 4 equipments.   As regards bulk deliveries,the passage at the top of page 3 of his memorandum was incorrect and should read, as follows:-&quot;As regards bulk deliveries, they  could being in June, 1940, at the rate of ISa month, provided the Field Forcerequirements were postponed to enablethese deliveries to be made to portuguese^L.The War Office do not like any suchdelay, and. take the view very strongly that the most that should he deliveredis 4 per month from June 1940 to theend of the year and three times that-amount in 1941&quot; .It would be noted in regard to 6&quot; howitzersand. 60-pdrs. that no forecast could, yet be made   asto when these were likely to be available.The proposals outlined above were the best that could be managed, and it was, of course, possiblethat they would not satisfy the Portuguese.
While the arrangements appeared to involve considerable delay, this was not really so, ifregard was had. to the fact that  it was not possibleto pirrcha.se articles like guns and equipment costing 15,000 a unit &quot;off the peg&quot;.    It would, of&quot; course,be realised that the Portuguese requirements wouldhave to be given priority over the requirements ofEgypt, India and the Dominions for guns of thesetypes.There remained, the question of how Portugal wasto pay for the orders.   Dr. Salazar had asked foreasy terms of payment, and. he was firmly under theimpression that the orders would be carried out by private firms.    Tn point of fe.et, however, they would,be carried out in establishments under government control, and the Treasury had advised that in orderto postpone payment for these deliveries it. would, benecessary to pass legislation.    In this connection the possibility of including some special provision in the Bill authorising the  6 millions armamentcredit for Turkey had been mooted.   While it mightbe possible to arrange easy terms of payment, it.should be remembered, that at present the finances of Portugal were in a sound and flourishing condition.The Prime Minister pointed out that the valueof the whole order only amounted to^ 2 millions.There could therefore be no question of Portugal&apos;disability to pay.    The only question was one of arranging terms:    e,g., if we received cash we should no doubt/be prepared, to take less than if we ha.d to givecredit..In the course of the subsequent discussion it waspointed, out that in the opinion of the War Officewe ought at present to retain all guns of these types-13-
for home defence.   While we might be anxious to helpPortugal, it was in this particular respect that wewere seriously deficient, and it would therefore bevery difficult in the near future to send Portugal asubstantial number- of the guns which would be avail-able.   Our minimum requirement was 600 guns, and inthe opinion of the War Office double that number wouldbe needed.In this  connection it was pointed out that theposition would have improved substantially by 1939,when some 200 3.7&quot; guns would, be available.The Prime Minister suggested that we might promisePortugal a token ;     delivery of 3.7&quot; guns in 1939but that we could make no promise to make furtherdeliveries until 1940, though we might offer someof the old 3&quot; guns.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs saidthat from the point of view of the Dominions Officehe disliked the suggestion that Portugal should begiven any priority in this matter over the Dominions.If this were known it might give rise to some ill-feeling.    In point of fact, only one Dominion, viz.,Canada, would be actually affected, but we had undertaken to find an unspecified number of 3.7&quot; and3.45&quot; guns in the programme given to Canada for theandyears 1940/41 .    If Portugal was to be given priorityit would be necessary to tell Canada that, these arrangements  could not be carried out.   At the sametime he felt that political considerations made itnecessary to fall in so far as possible with Portuguesewishes, even if this involved some postponement inthe case of Dominion requirements.-14-
The Prime Minister did not see how Canada wouldin fact he in any way prejudiced, for of all partsof the Empire Canada was perhaps the most immune fromrisk.Tn reply to enquiries, the Secretary of Statefor vVar informed the Cabinet that India had asked3 .7&quot;for 40^guns, but that the General Staff did not thinkIndia entitled to any high priority in the matter.As the result, of very strenuous efforts to obtainthesedelivery, the number o^yguns now available was about100:    they were at present coming forward at therate of 15 a. month, and this would ultimately beincreased to 40 a. month.    The outlook, therefore,was not nearly so serious as it hed. ^een a few weeks ago.The Chancellor of the Exchequer expressed theopinion that this was not a. case in which we shouldmake a.ny departure from the ordinary canons of sound finance,    ^he real questions were, - do theneeds of the united Fingdom (not those of Egypt,India, and the Dominions)  enable us to spare any ofthese guns for Portugal, and, if so, on what terms should the guns be sold to Portugal?The Minister for Co-ordination of Defenceobserved that Sir Robert Vans it tart had. expressedthe opinion that it was very important, to get thePortuguese Mission, now in London, into a. discussion on the subject. If this could be done it was not improbable that arrangements could, be made on thelines  contemplated in CP.-113 (.38).The President of the Board of Trade warned theCabinet th**t there appeared to be nothing in the telegrams  from, Lisbon which held out any hope that
proposals of this  character would prove acceptable.There was good reason to believe that Germany was inthea position to satisfy,&quot;Portuguese requxrements byimmediate delivery.mhe Secretary of State for Var said that theGeneral Staff had. pointed out that we were asking thePortuguese to make substantial concessions in regardto delivery dates, etc., and that it might be politicto assist them by offering to accept deferred payments in some form..The Prime Minister pointed out that, the objectionto such a. proposal was th**t it involved legislation.The same result  could be obtained by making ad.just-ments in regard to price.   He had recently seen an american journalist who had been in Spain and Vvho had spoken most enthusiastically about a German 4* gunwhich was claimed to       superior to other weapons ofthe same type.   He enquired how our 3.45&quot; gun wassupposed, to compare with this German gun.The Secretary of State for Var undertook to reportto the Prime Minister on this point.    Generally speak-ing, German guns o^ all kinds and  calibres were greatly superior to corresponding weapons of other powers .The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve in principle the proposalcontained in CP,-113 (38)/^ that weshould offer to provide Portugal with3.7&quot; and 3*45&quot; guns, leaving       theMinister for Co-ordination of Defencefull discretion to va.ry the details,such as conditions as to delivery, ashe might think necessary or desirable:(b) That there appeared, to be no justifiea-tion for departing in this  case fromthe ordinary rules of good, finance,amended, at the top of page 3 as indicated in thediscussion   see page 13 above.
or for entertaining suggestionssuch as that Portugal should,purchase the guns in question by making deferred, payments .    If&quot;,however, the Portuguese insisted on making deferred payments insome form as a condition of theaccept.a.nee of our offer, theMinister for Co-ordination ofDefence should aga.in bring thisquestion before the Cabinet forfurther consideration,.
-IS-THE AIR 6-  The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that hePROGRAMME.--- wished to know what the Air Ministry Spokesman in thet$he Debate on     House of Commons proposed to say in regard tothe Air&quot; estimates in the House of personnel and the provision of aerodromes in the commons on 12thjjay. Debate on the Air Ministry Vote on the following day.(Reference He understood that it was proposed to announce that cabinet 19(38),Conclusion 8(a). we aimed by March,  1940, to secure x machines; but although on the 13th April last the Cabinet had agreed that the Air Ministry should get in touch withthe Treasury, who would have authority to approve the recruitment of the personnel required to carry outthe proposed Programme, which must not be held up for lack of personnel;  he (the Chancellor of the Exchequer)had not yet been able to ascertain the kind of statement on recruitment which was to be made or thestatement dealing with the provision of aerodromes.As regards recruitment, there were broadly two views;(i) the balanced view,  i.e.  that recruitment shouldbe arranged so as to provide the necessary personnel for the machines covered by the Programme; ^ii) a verylarge additional recruitment which would not be part and parcel of the scheme to be rounded off by March,1940.    The arrangements for the aircraft to beprovided in the next two years were those approvedby the Cabinet on 24th April last (Cabinet 21(38),Conclusion 6).The Secretary of State for Air said that theAir Ministrys in consultation with the Treasury, had worked out with the greatest care and precision the personnel requirements on the basis of the tworecent decisions of the Cabinet to which the Chancellorof the Exchequer had referred.    The output of machines
during the current financial year was estimated at 4,000,and during the financial year ending 31st March, 1940,  atI 8,000.    The personnel required to be recruited for these machines/were:-Regular pilots.....,.    3,500Airmen of all types..   30,000Apprentices .........    3,000Boys    ...............    1,600Total  .....      38,100These figures did not, however,  include the recruitswhich would be taken into the volunteer reserve.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defenceobserved that in approving the proposals on the 27th april last, the Cabinet had got away from the former Schemes &quot;F&quot;and &quot;L&quot;.    He himself doubted whether it would be possibleto resist the pressure in the House of Commons for figuresof our actual strength in aircraft during the next twoyears.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster thoughtthat it would be possible to resist such pressure.    he proposed, for example,  to point out that it was not theGerman   practice to publish aircraft figures,  and then tosay that this year the aa hj v e a a ^ &quot;in- u m1 rate of production would be 50$ higher than the present rate of production,and that the following year (1939-40) the rate ofproduction would be trebled.The Prime Minister thought that it was very important to make it clear in the Debate that these increases were increases in the rate of production andnot in the number of machines produced.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster saidthat he also proposed to give the very impressive personnel
figures which when aggregated would eventually amount to.40,000 additional individuals.The Chancellor of the Exchequer observed that itwas most important that the balance between production of machines and recruitment should be secured.The Secretary of State for Air assured theChancellor of the Exchequer that this requirement would infact be met. As he had pointed out, the production plan of machines was 4,000 this year and 8,000 next year.    Thefigures of personnel to be recruited had been worked outwith the utmost care and precision in direct relationto the aircraft production, and the figures of personnelwhich he had given were those necessary to man and maintain the machines as they were produced.No estimate had ever been published of the numberof machines in the Programme, and he was most anxious thatno such figure should be published for reasons which heoutlined to the Cabinet.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence fullyshared the view of the Secretary of State for Air as to the undesirability of making public any aircraft figures.In reply to an enquiry by the president of the Boardof Trade, the Secretary of State for Air informed theCabinet of the figure35 of the present rate of monthlyproduction of aircraft.    He wished to make it clear thata very careful estimate had been made of the orders that had been placed and other material factors, with theresult that, provided the necessary labour was forthcoming,he could assure the Cabinet that the production of aircraft in the year ending 31st March,  1939 would be 4,000, andin the year ending 31st March,  1940, would be 8,000-R The figures given by the Secretary of Statefor Air have been inserted on the recordcopy of these Cabinet Minutes.-SO-
The Prime   Ministerenquired whether he was right in thinking that by the 31st March, IS40, our monthly production oof aircraft would have risen to the figure95 named by him.If this was the case, he thought that the Cabinet v/ould bevery agreeably surprised.The Secretary of State for Air said that the figurementioned by the Prime Minister was correct,  on theassumption,  of course,  that production proceeded accordingto olan.The Chancellor of the Exchequer wished to ast two questions,&apos; one,  was it proposed that the figures ofadditional personnel would be published in the Debate?.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster repliedin the affirmative.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out thatthe decision of the   Cabinet on the 13th April last(Cabinet 19(38),  Conclusion 8(a)) amounted  in effectthat Treasury approval of the personnel proposals was required.    Had this approval been obtained?The Secretary of State for Air understood that thiswas so.    In any case, he would be only too ready todiscuss and settle the matter with the Chancellor of theExchequer at any time.In the course of the subsequent discussion it waspointed out that  if the figures mentioned by the Secretaryof State for Air were realised,  our monthly production would amount to a figure substantially in excess of thepresent monthly production of aircraft in Germany.The Cabinet were,  however,  warned that Germany&apos;present monthly production might,  of course, increasesubstantially during the next two years.x   See footnote on page 20.
The Cabinet agreed:-(i) To invite the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Secretary of Statefor Air to confer in regard to thefigures of additional personnel tobe announced in the Debate in theHouse of Commons on the following day.(ii) That in order to minimise the risk ofleakage, the aircraft monthly productionfigures mentioned in the discussion should not be included in the circulatedcopies of these Cabinet Conclusions,but should be entered only on the record copy kept at the Cabinet Offices.
