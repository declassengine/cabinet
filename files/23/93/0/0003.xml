THE SITUATIONIN CENTRAL^EUROPE.Czecho-Slovakia.Draft statement to Parliament.(previous reference:Cabinet 15 (38)Conclusion 1.)le     The Cabinet had before them the draft ofa statement to be made in Parliament (CP.  75 (38))prepared by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs with the assistance of some of his colleagues in accordance with the decision of the cabinet referred to in the margin.The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs referred first to the communication to theFrench Government which had been despatched to Parison the previous evening.     He had now learnt thatthe train ferry had been delayed by fog and that,consequently, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador had not received it.     He was advised, however, that therewas a fair prospect that it would arrive in time.On the previous evening, he himself had seen the French Ambassador at the French Embassyfrom 9.30 to 11.0 p.m.     He had given the ambassador some indication of the lines of theCabinet&apos;s views.      Two points had emerged fromthis conversation.     M, Corbin had said that hisGovernment did not expect us to give a guarantee to Gzecho-Slovakia, but had indicated that theFrench Government did want to know whether weshould be with them if they got into war withGermany.     He (Lord Halifax) had replied on thelines of a passage on page 5 of the draft statement (CP.  75 (38)) where it was pointed outthat the inexorable pressure of facts made it probable that Governments which were not partiesto the original dispute might be involved,.     the ambassador had said that if we could say that thiswas probable rather than possible, the situation would not be too bad for the French Government *
The Foreign Secretary had pointed out that the minds of the British and French nations rarely saw questionsfrom exactly the same points of view, hut this did not mean that when an emergency arose they did not usuallywork togethercThe Foreign Secretary had given instructions that the aide memo1re prepared for the Ambassador wasto be circulated to the Cabinet, but he understood thatit had not reached his colleagues *     He agreed with thesuggestion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that thestatement to be made in Parliament must harmonise with the communication to the Frencho     He paid tribute to thegreat assistance he had received from the CabinetCommittee o?he inclusion Some discussion took place as to the desirability)f Spain.of including a reference to Spain in the ParliamentaryStatemento     Evidence was laid before the Cabinet toshow that the Opposition Parties in Parliament and theT.UoCo were now much more concerned with Spain than with Czecho-Slovakia0     Representatives of the ToUoC.in particular had recently attended a meeting of theInternational Federation of Trade Unions in Paris andhad come back somewhat alarmed at the dangers to france of a menace on a new frontiern      The Prime Minister hadalready seen Sir Walter Citrine and had given him someexplanations and reassurance0     There   was generalagreement, therefore, that some mention must be made of spain, but that it need only be a brief oneQSpain and The suggestion was made that, as the debate the oon-versations       went on, it was likely to centre more and more uponwith Italy.v      tr Spain0     In this connection, the Cabinet were reminded\previous reference:        that the Leader of the Labour Opposition had asked for cabinet 14(38)&apos; Conclusion 5.)an explanation of a phrase used in regard to the Italianj - M 2 -
Conversations - &quot;the settlement in Spain &quot;.The Foreign Secretary recalled that at thetime the phrase was used,  the Non-intervention Committeehad heen active and everyone had hoped for an early settlement.     Now the situation was changed,,Consequently, he had had to make clear to the ItalianGovernment the effect of this on the conversations.     Hethought that an explanation might be made on these lines.The Prime Minister said he would like to givethe general impression to Parliament that the italians were &quot;playing the game&quot;;    that we were satisfied that,notwithstanding rumours to the contrary, they had notrecently sent any more men to Spain and that they were showing evident signs that they did not intend to take action behind our backcThe Foreign Secretary did not dissent, butsuggested that caetion was necessary in any referenceto the Italians in Spain, owing to the share they were probably taking in the bombing of Barcelona.     He agreed,however, with a suggestion that to mention that we were satisfied, that recent rumours of the landing ofconsiderable numbers of Italians in Spain were incorrect,would have a reassuring effect both in this country andin Italy.It was suggested that the statement might include a reference to the action taken by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to protest against the bombing of Barcelona.The Cabinet agreed;(a)    To approve generally the revised draft of the Statement to be madein Parliament attached to cp. 75 (38):
(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should have authority,with the assistance of the drafting committee appointed at the meeting referred to in the margin, to put thedraft into final shape for use in both Houses of Parliament on thefollowing day, Thursday March 24th;(c) That the statement should include a reference to Spain,and that theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs should also consider the desirabilityof including reference to the Britishprotest against the bombing ofBarcelona and some impression of areassuring character as to the good faith as shown, by the ItalianGovernment in the Pome Conversations;(d) That members of the Cabinet, who hadsuggestions to make in connection withthe drafting should forward them atonce to the Secretary of State forForeign AffairsoNote:    For the reference to be included inthe Parliamentary Statement to theimprovement in our defences see thefollowing conclusiono

ITALY. 4.    The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs--- reported that in accordance with the intention he hadRelations mentioned on the previous day,  he had had a frank dis-with:cussion with the Italian Ambassador who had just returned(Previous^ t t 4- nwr:Q\from Rome.    He had expressed his satisfaction with theCabinet i^t^ooiConclusion 5.)assurances given to the Earl of Perth by Count Ciano,FR. P &apos;Ty4)b/i       but had explained frankly that in present circumstancesthese would not be sufficient to reassure Parliament,having regard to recent events in Spain.    He had addedthat His Majesty&apos;s Government quite understood thedifficulties of the Italian Government.    In all thecircumstances the only thing to be done for the present was for the two Governments to trust one another and makethe best of the situation.    The Ambassador had concurredand had replied that Signor Mussolini had great confidence in the Prime Minister.    The Foreign Secretary had inthe course of the conversation mentioned the bombing of Barcelona and Count Grandi had promised to reporthis observations to Rome and see what could be done toobtain a cessation of this bombing of civilians.    the ambassador had also referred cautiously to events in central Europe,  and had admitted that the ItalianGovernment had anxieties.    The general atmosphere ofthe conversation had been very favourable.
5,    The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs said that there was not much to report about theNegotiations   negotiations with Sire.    The general posit ion was the with.same as a week ago, that  is to sa;/ the Government of previous Reference Cabinet Eire had received our proposals, but had sent no formal14(38),  Con-clusion 7, )      reolyc    It was now known, however,  that they had found it impossible tc make the special concessions to Northern&apos;     Ireland fcr which we had asked.    Consequently there was a threat of a breakdown of the whole negotiations.Lord Craigavo;i. the Prime Minister of NorthernIreland,  and some of his colleagues had visited london at the end of last week*    They had made it quite clearthat they could not defend the existing trade agreement in Parliament,  and that if they tried to do so theywould be defeatedc    Lord Craigavon, however,  had made itclear that he wanted to help. - He and his colleagues had made various suggestions for help by the United KingdomGovernment to Northern Ireland with a view to surmountingthe difficulties.    The officials of the two governments were in touch and the proposals were being worked on.In the course of subsequent discussion both theSecretary of State for the Home Department and theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs stated that theywere impressed by the strength of the case of NorthernIreland.The Chancellor of the Exchequer,  while notunsympathetic to Northern Ireland,  said that some of theproposals made were not helpful, though there might beways in which help could be givene9 The Prime Minister pointed o\rt that NorthernIreland did not oarticipate in the financial sacrifices
to be undertaken by the United Kingdom under the proposed agreement.    The whole question must stand over until further information was available.
6.  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (CP. 72(38)),covering the following documents:-(i) An extract from the draft Minutes of the313th Meeting of the Committee of ImperialDefence (reproduced as Appendix II to thepresent Conclusions)-(ii) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State forWar (C.P.  26 (38)).    This Memorandum hadbeen under consideration by the Cabinet atthe Meeting referred to in the margin, whenit had been referred in the firstinstance to the Committee of ImperialDefence.(iii) A Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence,  originally circulated to theCommittee of Imperial Defence (Paper No.D.P.(P)21,  containing his observations onthe Memorandum by the Secretary of State forWar.After examining the proposals before them indetail, the Cabinet agreed:-To approve generally the reoommendations of theCommittee of Imperial Defence as set forth inthe draft Minutes of the 313th Meeting   andannexed to the present Conclusions,  subject tothe following?-(a) That in view of the decision takenby the Cabinet on the previous daycancelling the assumption :&apos;that thecourse of normal trade must not be impededby the reconditioning of the Services&apos;*(Cabinet 15(38) Conclusion 2 (a)),Conclusion (8) is out of date.    measures now being explored,  whether for obtainingsufficient labour for working threeshifts,  or for the construction of new factories,  or for the diversion todefensive preparations of factories now engaged on peace time work, may enableprogress to be made with requirementsboth of anti-aircraft guns and of thefield force.(b) That the first two lines of Conclusion(14) which at present reads as follows:-
&quot;To approve the principle that wherevercircumstances permit, regular unitscomposed of local personnel should besubstituted wholly or partially forBritish units ....&quot;should be amended to read -&quot;To approve the principle that wherevercircumstances permit,  local person lei,whether on a regular or volunteer basis,should be substituted wholly or partiallyfor British units .... &quot;(c) That the general approval to theConclusions of the Committee of ImperialDefence was given on the following under-standings :-(i) That the recommendations were intendedto permit the accumulation in peacetime of sufficient reserves and potential to send abroad the sevenDivisions at the dates specified inConclusion (IS);    but that the priority laid down by the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence still holdsgood;  and that the expenditure involved in the new recommendationshas to be made within those priorities and within the finance which can beprovided for the army.    Further, thatthe remarks in paragraph 17 of theMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor War (D.P.(P)17) in regard to thetotal number of Divisions which itmight be possible to despatch overseasin    course       of time, do not giveauthority for the accumulation of reserves and ootential for such extraDivisions in time of peace.(ii) That the understanding set forth in(i) above was not intended tointerfere with the freedom of theGeneral Staff to use the conclusions as a basis for future organisation.(d) That the following questions which aroseout of the consideration of Conclusion(20) of the Committee of Imperial DefenceP/*&apos;7(3*0/.     (the communication of information to theji /S (5t)y.     French Government) should be reserved&apos;      for further consideration -(i) Whether any communication to theFrench Government should be made atthe same time to the Belgian Government.(Note: For reasons of secrecy it wassuggested that any communication on military matters to either government should be made throughthe military channel.)
(ii) Whether the suggestion that was beingmade by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to the French Govern-ment in favour of conversations between the Air Staffs should beextended to the Army General staffs of the two countries.(e) That the Secretary should take appropriatesteps to see that the above questions are brought before the Cabinet.
DEFENSIVE 7.   The Cabinet had before them a MemorandumPREPARATIONSBY CIVIL by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence^DEPARTMENTS-(CP.  74(38)),  in which attention was called toAcceleration the position of the defensive preparations fallingof:within the responsibility of the Civil Departments.(previous reference The Minister proposed that the Cabinet should issueCabinet 13(38),Conclusion 3(b)).a general directive to all Departments in the sense that -(i) War preparation work is to have equalpriority to civil work(ii) That the aim must be to complete it asfar as possitle by say, the 31st July, 1938,except in so far as it involves work of--onstruction which cannot be finished by then and(iii) That Civil Departments should telloff the staff required to producethese results even if it shouldmean a readjustment of theirpresent organisation and a temporary increase of staff.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defencerecalled that under the instructions laid down for him in the Statement Relating to Defence, 1936(Cmd.  5107) was included the following:-Discernment of any points which eitherhad net been taken up,  or are being pursued too slowly,  and (in consultationwith the Prime Minister or other ministers or Committees as required) to take appropriate measures for their rectification.It was in accordance with that duty thathe had made the proposals before the Cabinet.The Cabinet were informed that the proposeddate (31st July, 1938) was not feasible in the caseof the preparations of some of the CivilianDepartments.    Examples were mentioned where these* Departments were held up for lack of decision by theGovernment or by other Departments,  includingService Departments.
Emphasis was placed also on the unavoidable prioritythat often had to be given to immediate parliamentary business to the detriment of defensive preparations.Additional staff that would be useful in dealing withthe highly complicated questions arising in defensive preparations was difficult to obtain. Subject to the dropping of the proposed date, however, the Cabinet werein favour of the recommendation.The Cabinet agreed:-(a) To approve the recommendations of theMinister for Co-ordination of defence in the following form:-(i) War preparation work is to haveequal priority to civil work.(ii) The aim must be to complete it at as early a date as possible.(iii).That Civil Departments should telloff the staff required to producethese results even if it shouldmean a readjustment of theirpresent organisation and a temporary increase of staff.(b) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should invite Sir James Rae, Under secretary at the Treasury to place himself in communication with the Departments con-cerned with a view to giving them thebenefit of his unique experience in anyadditions or readjustments to staff thatmight facilitate the objects of thesedecis ionso
THAMES 8.    The Minister of Transport informed the Cabinet that3ARRAG-EJIQUIRY. during the last three years a demand had been growingup to test the practicability of a proposal for building a barrage across the Thames,  among the objects of whichwould be to facilitate navigation by the disappearance of tidal effects above the barrage and to assist firefighting.    There had been much propaganda on the subject.The Port of London Authority regarded the proposal withdisfavour and had hitherto resisted an inquiry-    He had pointed out to them, however,  that there was a section in the Port of London Act which placed the authority under the obligation to grant an inquiry if this was askedfor.    After consultation with the two parties, both had agreed to accept an inquiry by Sir Henry Maybury,  a formerofficial of the Ministry of Transport,  who was to be assisted by one of the Trinity House Masters-    The inquiryT/as due to begin on March 29th.    On narch 22nd there had reached his hands a letter from the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence pointing out that the questionof the barrage had been examined by the Home DefenceCommittee,  which advised that the barrage would providea good target for bombing attack and that  in consequencethere would be a grave danger in the event of war thatdocks would be put out of action and ships left high anddry.    Consequently,  whatever the result of the inquiry,the Government would have to veto the proposal.    he wished to consult the Cabinet as to how he should now proceed.    The Port of London Authority disliked the inquiry so much that they would seize any opportunityto dispense with it, and for this reason he ratherhesitated to make the communication to that body direct.
In the course of a short discussion it waspointed out that if a communication was made, as suggestedby the Minister of Transport, to Sir Henry Maybury,  itwould be within the latter&apos;s power to refuse to act asarbitrator.The Cabinet agreed:-To authorise the Minister of Transport tosend for Sir Henry Maybury;  to give him thepurport of the letter from the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence; to invite him tocall a meeting of the two parties to thedispute,  or to take such other action as he might deem appropriate.
-il9rCLUBS BILL. 9.      The Home Secretary said that, as hiscolleagues were aware, various pledges had &quot;been made(previous reference: by the Government to introduce a Bill to make better. Cabinet 38(37)&quot; Conclusion 8). provision   for preventing abuses of the law relatingto clubs.      Several meetings had been held on thisf^ .5-7 (38)6&quot;.subject, and the result was that the original Bill hadbeen to a considerable extent emasculated.      By thetime it had^been subjected to Parliamentary examinationit would probably have but few friends.      Nevertheless,as the Government are pledged in the matter, he had consulted the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury,who had agreed that the best plan would be to get theBill drafted and to introduce it in the House of Lords.The timetable now was such that there was no prospectof passing the Bill in the present session.      Tointroduce into the House of Lords so dubious a measuremight easily confront the Government with difficulties,and it was hardly worth doing that if there were no prospect of passing the measure.      The ministers concerned had discussed the question, and all were agreed that no useful purpose would be served in introducing the Bill.      He thought,  therefore,  thatthe best course would be a little later on to choose an appropriate moment to announce with regret that theGovernment had had to drop the Bill so far as thepresent session was concerned.The Cabinet were reminded that many Bills,including some very useful ones, would have to be dropped.The Cabinet agreed:-To approve the proposal of the HomeSecretary that the Clubs Bill- should be dropped.
G9louNG 10.      The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thefelRSONS.Home Secretary (CP-  70 (38)),  in which approval was. asked for the preparation of a Bill to give effect topours ofimployment m the outstanding recommendations of a Departmentalcertain un-regulated Committee which had reported in January, 1937,  on theOccupations.hours of employment of young persons in certainI previous reference: unregulated occupations.

Major Procter and a number of other Private members to abolish the powers of Agricultural marketing boards to impose and recover monetary penalties fromregistered producers.      The text of the Bill had onlybecome available within the last two or three days.He proposed to prepare a memorandum on thesubject for consideration by the Cabinet at its nextweekly meeting, since the matter was one of some importance.      In the meantime, he would be glad to havethe concurrence of his colleagues in arranging for theBill to be blocked by the Government Whips till thematter had been considered by the Cabinet.The Cabinet agreed:-To approve the course proposed bythe Minister of Agriculture andFisheries and set forth above.
r I DOCKING ANDI NICKING OPI HORSES.I(Previous^Reference:ICabinet 2(58)Conclusion 7)Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1. ,23rd March, 1938.13.      The Minister of Agriculture and fisheries reported that the Docking and Nicking of Horses(Prohibition) Bill had been introduced in the House ofLords by a private Member (Lord Merthyr).      The Billsought to prohibit the docking and nicking of horsesand the importation of docked and nicked horses.      Ithad been brought before the Cabinet at the meetingheld on 26th January, referred to in the margin, whenthe purpose and prospects of the Bill were briefly.discussed and certain decisions were taken.Contrary to expectations, the Bill had nowpassed the Lords and had been read a first time in the commons.      If it made further progress,  someamendments would be necessary to make it readilyworkable.In principle, however,  there seemed no reasonto depart from the earlier decisions of the Cabinet,which,  at the request of the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries, were reaffirmed as follows:-(a) that the Government should take no partin the Debate in the Commons;(b) that if the question of affordingspecial facilities for the passage ofthe Bill should arise, no undertakingshould be given;(c) that members of the Government shouldbe free to vote as they wish.

The measures have been from timet- time laid before Parliament    Recently in connection with theEstimates for the Defence Departments, statements havo beensubmitted to the House of Commons as to the steps to be takenin the next financial year,    The existing programme, however,has been carried out so   as not to impede normal trade,,    Infact notwithstanding this limitation an increasing degree of priority over civil work has been gradually accorded to re-armament orders with the result that in many cases the executionof orders for home and export trade has been delayed,,    Theadditional labour skilled and semi-skilled required by thsprogramme has been provided in many cases at the cost of with-drawing labour from other activities,.    Only by such means hasit been possible to undertake   th3  large scale programme ofproduction which, in spite of lamentable delays in some cases,is now continuously and rapidly increasing in volumeoHis Majesty&apos;s Government havo in the presentcircumstances decided that further action is necessary.    Notonly must additional efforts be made to complete the orders and works in hand, but the Government will henceforward ask that full priority should be given to re-armament work.    Theyare aware of the effect which this decision is likely to havern regular industry and on export trade in particular.    In anycase this change in policy can only be carried out with the goodwill and co-operation of all concerned.    It will be necessary
to recruit fresh labour for re-arrnament work.      steps are now being ta.:en to inform organised Labour of theGovernment&apos;s requirements and His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare confident that the necessary help will be forth-coming.     By such means it is expected that the volumeof production, which is not yet sufficient for our needs,will be substantially increased.      The buildingoperations necessary for the expansion of the three services will be expedited.      This will facilitate the process of recruitment of Naval, Military and AirForce personnel.     The action already indicated for providing skilled labour will serve to accelerate theproduction of naval equipment.      Similar measures willbe taicen for completing at the earliest date possiblethe erection of new factories.     rurther capacity witha view to advancing the output of ^/&quot;anti-aircraft   /guns will be put in hand.     The necessary supplies ofmaterial for an increased rate of airframe constructionare now being arranged with the help of the priorityab ove-ment i one d.These and other measures within the defence departments for the purpose of removing impediments to production and of improving the organisation of theindustries concerned will both increase the total volumeof production and accelerate the completion of theexisting programme.25rd March, 1958.

Paper No. 1215-B, Enclosure 2, Volume 1, paragraph 34, thewhole question of the strength and disposition of our overseasgarrisons would require reconsideration.(13) To take note of the desirability of maintaining a reserve of British troops under control of the War Office, as well as its sources of supply, insome locality east of the Mediterranean basin; but that the fulfilment of this conception must depend partly on the result of negotiations between the War Office and India Office, referred to in (16) below, andpartly on other factors, both political and financial, which wouldrequire further examination in detail.(14) To approve the principle that wherever circumstances permit, regularunits, composed of local personnel, should be substituted wholly orpartially for British units in the garrisons overseas, and that regularBritish anti-aircraft and coast defence units abroad should be dilutedwith local personnel: and to take note that the arrangements necessaryfor this purpose would be discussed between the Secretary of State forWar and the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(15) To take note that the Cabinet had already agreed that the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs should place himself in communicationwith the Secretary of State for War on the subject of the proposedfurther approach to some of the Dominions with a view to obtainingassistance in time of peace in the defence of Imperial Communications(e.q.. in the garrison of Singapore).(16) To take note-(a) that the Prime Minister had authorised discussion between the india Office and the War Office on the questions raised inparagraphs 14-15 of the Memorandum by the secretary of Statefor War.

despatched overseas in the early stages of a war would be 4 regulardivisions and 1 mobile division, but that in these circumstances nofurther contingents could be sent for at least 10 months and probably more.(20) That the information contained in (18) and (19) above should becommunicated to the French Government in the conversations to beheld in accordance with the conclusions of the Cabinet referred to inC.I.D.
