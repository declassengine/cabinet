. ITALY. 1*     The Secretary of State for ForeignConversationswith. Affairs read to the Cabinet a precis of the Anglo-previous Italian Agreement, which is reproduced as an reference:Cabinet 18 (38)Conclusion 2.) Appendix to these Conclusions.PR. %l(3*)LZ*.In reply to questions from colleagues, hesaid that in the matter of the Chilian 8-in. gunCruisers the Italian Foreign Minister had made a personal explanation in the course of which he had intimated that it was unlikely that the order wouldbe carried out in Italy.On the question of putting the agreementinto effect he was not sure as to the exact procedure,but he tinder took to give the Prime Minister aMemorandum on the subject, which he could use as abasis for answering Questions in Parliament.On the question of the Suez Canal itappeared probable that all parties would besatisfied - the United Kingdom, Italy and Egypt.F.P-51 On the subject of Palestine, the Earl of* Perth had received an oral assurance to the effectthat the Italian Government would take no actionlikely to embarrass the Administration, and permission
had &quot;been given for this statement to be published inParliament.     This assurance, however, applied exclusively to the present Mandate (discussions were still proceeding as to the formula which should best make this clear),since the Italians were unwilling to commit themselves inany way about the attitude they might adopt towardsfuture proposals for the disposition of the territory of Palestine.On the subject of Syria, Count Ciano had intimated that he was hoping for early talks with theFrench Government and anticipated no difficulty.     Nopermission had been given as yet for any public statement on this matter.The Secretary of State asked the views ofthe Cabinet as to the date of signature and publication.Signature on Good Friday was ruled out.     one possibility was to sign the Agreement on Saturday nextand to publish on Sunday.     A first alternative wasto sign on Sunday and publish on the followingWednesday.     A second alternative was to signjpn Tuesdayand to publish on Wednesday. His own
inclination,    which he had discussed on the telephone with the Earl of Perth, was to offer theItalians a choice between the latter alternatives.His publicity experts had advised him that Saturdaywas an inconvenient day for signature.    In their view the Sunday newspapers in London would not publish theAgreement in full.   mhe papers appearing on EasterMonday would not he widely read, as the publicinterests would lie elsewhere on Bank Holiday.In the course of a. short discussion the opinion was expressed that the leading Sunday newspapers wouldpublish the Agreement as fully as the leading dailies,and would he read by much the same public.   Additionalpublicity would be gained on Monday.    Postponement of signature until Tuesday, it was s-ggested, wouldinvolve an element of risk and. was not likely to be acceptable to the Italian Government, .    On the otherhand, to sign on Saturday an&apos;1  to postpone publicityuntil Wednesday would involve ve^y considerable risk ofpremature an&apos;3 inaccurate publicity.    On the whole,therefore, signature on Saturday and publication on sunday was thought advisable.In reply to a question, the Secretary of State-for Foreign Affairs said that the prospects of reaching agreement at Geneva depended a good deal on circum-stances that could not yet be foreseen, and on the for^ of the Resolution it was found possible to submit.As his colleagues were aware, the Foreign Office were taking soundings among the different  countries repre-sented on the Council.    Tf the worst  came to the worstand it was not thought possible to submit a Resolutionwith any prospect of acceptance, the question would, beraised in general debate an^ the British representative
position to the world.^   For example, it. might haveto he explained that no Resolution had been possibleowing to the opposition of certain countries.In reply to another question he said, that hehad invited Mo Avenol, the Secretary-General of theLeague of Nations, to visit London-The question vra.s raised as  to whether some reference ought not to be made,  in the exchange of notes on the subject of Spain, to war materialfurnished by Italy to General Francomaterial to General Francoand that it was difficult to make any conditions a.sto its withdrawal.    The assumption in the exchangeof Notes was that the Spanish -Var was over, and when that point was reached the ammunition would not be ofany value to help General Franco to win the war.The Cabinet agreed  (a) ^o approve the Agreement as set. forth in the precis in the Appendix to theseConclus ions:(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should, be invited to arrange forthe signature of the Agreement on Saturday,16th April, an^ for its publication inthe newspapers of Easter Sunday and EasterMonday.    In addition, he should makeappropriate arrangements for informing the Press a.s to the contents of theAgreement:would declare our own position, namely, that we hadnot in any way weakened our moral position, hut found it necessary to f?ce the facts, and would encourage the representatives of other nations to state theirviews in the same way *    The debate would then be
(c) To congratulate the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs on his success inthese negotiations, and to invite himto send a. formal message of congratulate-lation to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in rome:(d) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should prepare a Memorandum onthe procedure proposed for the eventualratification o^ the Agreement, for theuse of the Prime minister-r in answeringParliamentary Questions *
2.    ^he Secretary of State for Foreign affairs invited the attention of the Cabinet to his Despatchof April 11th (No.727 Secret) to Sir &quot;5. Phipps(Paris), which, in accordance with the decision ofthe Cabinet referred to in the margin, had been examined and approved by the Cabinet Committee onForeign Policy.He also drew attention to his telegram No .52, ofApril 12th, to Mr Nekton (Prague)  informing him  ofthe instructions given to His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Paris in the Despatch mentioned above, and. as tothe steps it was proposed to take at the appropriate moment.Referring to the Prime Minister&apos;s statement onthe subject of our attitude towards CzechoslovakiaIn the TJouse of Commons on March 24th, he explainedthat the best policy appeared t^ be to discourage toobroad a.n interpretation of the phrase about it being&quot;well within the bounds of probability that othercountries besides those which are parties to the originaldispute&quot; might become involved, while giving greater emphasis to it in Berlin so as to warn the German Govern-ment of the danger that in any aggression against Czecho-slovakia. they might be causing more widespread, troublethan they thought.   By this policy it might bepossible to brine both sides to reason.A short discussion took place, in the courseof which attention wa.s directed more particularly to the suddenness of the German aggression againstAustria and the extreme difficulty, under modern conditions, of obtaining information as to troop movements which would give us warning of any similarenterprises elsewhere.
3. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that he was not encouraged, by such informationas he had. received, to think that the new Governmentin France was likely tQ last very long.
KB ROLE OP THE jstermnicationjfPinfo r ma. t io nto the Frenchand Belgianjovernments .Stsf ^ Conver-38.t ions .(previous reference:Cabinet 18(38), Con-clusion 7.)4.  In pursuance of the Conclusion mentioned inthe margin, the Cabinet had before them a Most secret note by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence( C.P.-94 (38)) on the subject of Staff conversations with Prance and Eelgium, to which he attached, thefollowing documents:-The Conclusions of the 319th Meetingof the Committee of Imperial Defence,held, on 11th April (Annex T), to whichhe invited the approval of the Cabinet:-    2 2 1+.The draft Minutes of the above-mentionedMeeting of the Committee of ImperialDefence (Annex II):A Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (C0.S.-707) as to thescope of the Staff Conversations and.the forces and areas to which theyshould apply &apos; Annex III) .After the Minister for Co-ordination of defence had explained the proposals of the Committee ofImperial Defence, the Prime Minister, who had. beenin the Chair, pointed out that the Report by theChiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, which was well drawnup, interesting and helpful, had led the Committee ofImperial Defence to certain conclusions that did not quite correspond *o those adopted by the Cabinet atthe Meeting referred to in the margin.   He thought,however, that the Cabinet would probably approve them.He pointed out that the whole proposals were coveredby Conclusion (l)(a) of the Committee of ImperialDefence, namely, that the first communication to theFrench Government of the limitations on the extent ofour co-operation, especially by lan^ forces, should,be made through Ministerial or Diplomatic channelsbefore the Staff Conversations begin. vIn the course of the discussion the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs expressed doubts as to theform, o^ Conclusion (6) of the Committee of ImperialDefence.    Tf the decision of the Government were
presented as suggested therein to the French government it would, have a very depressing effect.    His ownimpression was that the intention o^ the Committee ofImperial Defence had been to say that it was not certainthat we could send any land force    at all, and that, ifwe could send it it would he so small as not to requireStaff Conversations,    ^hat line would be more consistent with the previous decision of the Cabinet that -&quot;If the obligation involved in the Treatyof Locarno should a^ise and the Govern-ment of the day, after considering our other mil it a-ry commitments at home andabroad, should decide to despatch amilitary force to France, the maximumforce which our present organisation will enable them to send would be twoRegular Divisions and a. Mobile Divisionwithin thr-ee weeks. followed by two furtherRegular Divisions in Z plus 40 days.&quot;(Cabinet 5 (.38). Conclusion II. p.*Sg.)The Prime Minister agreed that much would dependon the actual presentation of the decision.    He ratherdeprecated, however, any alteration in the Conclusion,,which had been hnsed. on a consideration of the following paragraph in the Report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee ( c .05,S .-707, Paragraph 17):-&quot;Ve must draw attention to the fact thatthe French General Staff and nation, asin 1914. will expect that, once we are committed to military co-operation, weshall, in fact, be &quot;committed, to co-operation on a far larger scale.    If the originalforces should be wiped out or prove insuf-ficient, it is difficult to see how thisis to be avoided, and. this is a point onwhich the French General Staff, with theirlogical minds, will seize.    We ask for clearinstructions as to whether, at the present stage, the representatives of the GeneralStaff are to adhere strictly to the main-tenance of the original forces mentionedin paragraph 14 above and to discoura.geall idea, of any further expansion.&quot;After considering that advice the Committee of ImperialDefence had decided that, since our assistance on land would in any case be so small, it would be better thatIt should not form, the subject of Staff Conversations.
^he Minister for Co-ordination of defence agreed with, the Prime Minister.   He thought adefinite decision had been arrived at that, notwith-standing the disappointment that would be caused, to french Ministers, it was only fair to tell them thatthey must not count on receiving a force of two divisions and that it would be better for their general Staff to base their plans on the assumptionthat it would not be sent.    Later on, of course, ifthe conditions in the war permitted, it might bepossible to send assistance.mhe Prime Minister pointed out that one effectof such a statement on the French Government mightwell be to encourage them to complete the MaginotLines .The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat, his ma.in point was to emphasise that, our intention was not to say that in no circumstances could land forces be sent.Other points raised in the discussion aresummarise^ in the Conclusions.The Cabinet approved the conclusions and Recommendations of the Committeeof Imperial &quot;Defence as set forth below,subject to a few observations whichhave been inserted in the followingrevised text:-General.(l) To approve the assumptions in Paragraph4 of the Chiefs of Staff Report (D.P.(P) 24)in the following form:-f a) Tha.t the first communication tothe French Government of the liro.it-ations on the extent of our 00-opera.tion, especially by land, forces,will be made through Ministerial orDiplomatic channels before the staff conversations begin*
tb) That the Conversations are undertaken on the basis  that we are called uponto fulfil the undertaking to go tothe assistance of Prance (Belgium)in the event of unprovoked aggression by Germany, given in the Treaty of locarno of 1925, and reaffirmer! inparagraph 3 of the Agreement drawnup in London on March 19th, 193 6,after the occupation by Germany ofthe demilitarised zone in the Rhine-land, which reads as follows:-The Representatives of Belgium,Prance, the United Finedom ofGreat Britain and Northern Irelandand of Italy&quot;Declare that nothing that, has happened before or since thesaid, breach of the Treaty of locarno can be considered, as having freed, the signatories of that Treaty from any oftheir obligations or guarantees and that the latter subsist intheir entirety.Undertake forthwith to instruct their General Staffs to enterinto contact with a. view toarranging the technical condi-tions in which the obligations which are binding upon them should be carried out in caseof unprovoked aggression.&quot;( Cmd.. ^134/3 6) : &quot;&quot;and that, the Conversations are under-taken without any reference to thetwo alternatives suggested, in our report on Military Implications ofGerman Aggression against Czecho-Slovakia. (n.P.(P) 22.)f c) That Italy is neutral.(d) That, the intention is that anyConversations with the French may also be extended to the Belgians .Any communication to the Belgianson secret matters shoul^ be made through Staff channels.(2) That the initial communication to theFrench Government referred to above,besides containing the notificationthat His Majesty&apos;s Government are pre-pared. to authorise Staff Conversations,should also include the following points,which are dealt with in greater detailbelow :-(a) The scope of the ConversationstConclusion (3)):(b) Our conception o^ the character ofthe war (Conclusion (4)):    and
(e) The nature and extent of our co-, operation at the outset  of war&apos;^added to the original (Conclusions (6),  (7)*and (8)*.)draft Conclusions.The necessary material for Ministerialor, alternatively, for Diplomatic usein connection with this communicationwill he furnished, to the Foreign office by the Defence Departments concerned.(3) That, in view of the satisfactory progress made in the Conversations with Italy andthe great importance of doing nothingcalculated either to jeopardise theconclusion of an Agreement or to weakenit thereafter, it is undesirable toextend, the scope of the Conversationsto the Mediterranean.   Also, in view ofthe extent to which Japan is  committed in China, it is unnecessary at present to extend them to cover the Far East.For the present, therefore, the politicalassumptions on which Staff conversations should be founded should be a strictinterpretation of ou^ Treaty obligations to France and Belgium;    that is to say,Germany alone should be assumed, as the aggressor, and the Conversations shouldnot be permitted to comprehend theextension of war to other nations, whether as potential enemies or allies,    ^heEritish representatives, if pressed bythe French Staff representatives to extend the scope of the Conversations to embracewider political assumptions, must be careful to avoid giving a rebuff, and should explain that ^is Majesty&apos;s Government, in the UnitedKingdom, after careful examination, did. notconsider any further political assumptionsnecessary or desirable at the present time.(4) That the military background of the Conversa-tions should be, not a repetition of 1914,but war of the character envisaged by theCommittee of Imperial Defence, in whichthe course of action most likely to beadopted by Germany is believed to involve an attempted knock-out blow.    In view ofthe strength of the Maginot Lines this is less likely to be directed, against Francethan against the industrial and. other resources of this  country, which areespecially vulnerable to air attack.Naval.(5) That Naval Conversations should not beheld, at present^5 for the following reasons:-x This recommendation involves a reversal of cabinet conclusion 18 (38) 7 (a) of the 6th April, 1938,when it was decided that the proposed Air staff conversations should be extended, to the Naval and army Staffs also.
(a) the contingency which is to formthe basis of the Conversations (see conclusion (3) above), namely, an aggression by Germany, which doesnot involve either Italy or Japan,does not  call for any re-distribution in time of peace of the British and.French Fleets:(b) plans for the effective co-operationof these Fleets could, be concertedvery quickly after the outbreak ofwar;( c)   if the fact of our having enteredinto Naval Conversations with theFrench were to become known toGermany, she might make it an excuseto ^enounce the Anglo-German naval agreement of July 17, 193 7, to themaintenance of which the Admiralty      ^.attach great importance.Army .(6) That, in view of our conception of the mostprobable course of the war (see Conclusion(4) above), and the recent decisions as tothe Role o^ the Army, which follow from it,the probability of our being able to send,an Expeditionary Force to France or Pelgiumat an early stage of the war is so slightthat Military Staff Conversations areSee note at foot unnecessary.^ It should be emphasised, inof previous pa.ge . the communication to the French Governmentreferred to in Conclusions ^1)  and. (3)above that our assistance to France willtake other forms:    that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had felt that  it would be unfair to the French Government not to notify them of this :    and that, the French General Staffswould accordingly be well advised to base their plans on the assumption that, in theearly stages of a war at any rate, it willprobably not be practicable for us to send,a. military Expeditionary Force to theContinent.OBSERVATION BY THE CABTWEm:The form in which this  communication is to be madeto the French Government will require careful  consider-at.ion and will vary a.ccording a.s to whether it is madein a Conversation between Ministers or through diplomatic channels.    It will be necessary to avoid giving the impression that at no stage of a war shallwe e^er be in a position to co-operate with land forces .Air Force .(7) ^hat, as recommended by the Chiefs of staff committee, the scope of the Air staff conversations should be as follows:-(a) A general discussion as to the plans of the two Air Forces.
(b) A frank inter1 change of informal^as to the capacity of the two Forcesat the present time and the extent towhich this may be expected to developas time goes ont(c) Detailed plans for the co-operation ofthe two air striking forces, togetherwith the administrative detailsnecessary to enable British Air forces to operate ^om French soil .(d) ^he co-ordination or the three air defence Systems,  including the linkingup of the observation and warningsys t ems(8) With reference to Conclusion(7)(c)  above,alternative plans for our own Air striking force should be prepared, first to dealwith the case of the main G-emrjan air attackbeing directed against this country, and,secondly, to deal with the case of the mainGerman air attack being directed against france.    Tn accordance with our generalconception of the probable course of thewar, it should be frankly explained to theFrench that the primary object of our air striking Force is the defence of thiscountry, out the Conversations would naturally bring out the fant that any action which we might take to reduce thescale of attack on the British Isles wouldbe a. substantial, albeit indirect,  contri-bution towards the defence of France.OBSERVATION BY THE CABINET:It is assumed that in Conclusions ( 7) ( c)  above and(8)  the intention of the Committee of Imperial defence is to include the discussion of a.ssista.nce by theFrench Air Force to the United Kingdom if,  as theCommittee of Imperial &quot;Defence believe to be probable,the main attack is directed against the TTnit ed kingdom in the air,    ^he Secretary of State for Air should seethat- this point is not overlooked V y any represents.-tives of the Air Staff taking part in the proposed conversations.      In this  connection attention is drawn to the following st&quot;tement by y[- TTelhbs in a debate on foreign Affairs  in the French Chamber onthe afternoon of December 4. 1955:-&quot;I wish to declare, in the name of theGovernment, that., similarly, all theforces of France, on land, on sea andin the air, would be spontaneously and immediately used for the defence ofGreat Britain in the event of an unpro-provoked aggression&quot;..    (Annex to despatch from Sir G. Clark to Mr Eden (0.8730/1/17)dated December 7. 193 6.)(9) That the Secretary of State for  ir should give further consideration to the risk ofGermany accusing the Air Staff, in theevent of Conversations, o^ a brea.ch o^ the
undertaking given by the Chief of the AirStaff and his predecessor not to divulgeto the French information of German air strength, which had been ^iven to themby the German Air Staff and which on thefirst occasion proved, inaccurate, and. onthe second^ occasion was already known tous.    Tf it is considered that such a risk is a real one, it should then be consideredby the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the Secretary of State for Airwhether notification should be made toGermany of the Conversations, and an assurance given as to the observance ofthe undertaking above referred to.   Asimilar point will arise in the event ofNaval Conversations be:ng taken up later.OBSERVATION BY THE CABTNErAmendment tothe original draft conclusions-sions .The recommendation that the Secretary of State ^or air should  give further consideration to this question was endorsed by the Cabinet -    Tt was pointed out that,the matter required examination from two points ofview, namely,  (l) that we might lose a valuable source of information, and (2) that we might be accused of^bad faith,    ^he Cabinet were advised . on the first-point, that the information was not essential.    On thesecond point, however,  it was recognised that  ifConversations took place the German Government might,refuse to believe any assurances that we might  give.The question was felt to require further consideration,(lO) That if it is decided to make a communi-cation to the German Government on theproposed Conversations with the French and belgian Governments, it should be made clearthat the Conversations are merely a contin-uation of the contacts between General Staffsannounce^ in March, 1936, after the German- xre-occupation of the Rhineland (Cmd.5134/3 6).(ll) That the question       whether the Conversa-tions between the British and French (and belgian) Air Staffs should be conducted,through the channel of Air Attaches andoccasional interchanges of visits, as previously contemplated (Cabinet 5 (38)Conclusion 12), or whether they should bebrought on to a. higher plane as decided inprinciple by the Cabinet (Cabinet 18 (38)Conclusion 7 (a)) should be reserved forthe pres ent.
1/1555.     The Minister for Co-ordination of Defencerecalled that, at the meeting referred to in the margin,he had &quot;been authorised to take certain steps for thecreation of reserve stocks of wheat, whale oil, sugar and other articles of food.So far as wheat was concerned,  the wholeof the purchase had been completed and approximately405,000 to 410,000 tons had been bought.      Of this280,000 tons were actual wheat and the remainingconsisted of options which would be exchanged indue course for actual wheat.     In accordance with thecustom of the trade, each purchase was subject to10 per cent, variation either way.     More than 80 percent of our purchase was completed on Friday beforethe American market closed;    the remainder was boughtquietly, partly on Saturday morning and partly onMonday morning.     Purchases were made almost entirelyat market price;    they were deliberately spread overa very large number of sellers so as to conceal theoperation for as long as was practicable.     prices had remained remarkably steady.     The 400,000 tonsof wheat purchased was equivalent approximately to4 weeks&apos; normal consumption.     The result was,therefore, that we should never have less than14 weeks&apos; consumption of wheat in this country andeven that amount would arise shortly before the harvest which, would give us some months additional supplies.Coming to whale oil, he recalled that theCabinet on February 2nd, 1938, had authorised him toarrange with Unilever Ltd. for an increase in thestock of whale oil normally held in this country soas to produce a minimum reserve of 60,000 tons of- 15 -
whale oil which should represent in time of war 4 weeks&apos;supply of edible fats.     The position in this matter was made particularly difficult owing to the fact thatthe Germans had purchased from the Norwegians last week107,000 tons.     The Norwegians had then raised the pricebut,at the end of the previous week, we had succeeded in purchasing 40,000 tons from a British firm at areasonable price and he was hoping to obtain the balance tomake up 100,000 tons which was still on the market.The Minister recalled that it had beendecided to create a reserve of 150,000 tons of raw sugarwhich was equivalent to approximately 4 weeks&apos; normalconsumption.     Considerable progress ha^d been made but no definite contract had yet been placed.     It was hopedthat this would be done before the end of the following week.     This store would not be completed until November,but it was anticipated that 50,000 tons of this   would be imported before the end of July. Perhaps the principal valueof these food stocks was psychological.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries asked theCabinet to take note that there was no truth in the statementpublished in a newspaper that he had assured Norfolk farmersthat the Government intended to purchase wheat to be held inthe stack.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To take note of the statement by theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence:(b) That the Minister should be authorisedto make a statement in Parliament atan appropriate moment after the Recess:(c) That he should draw up the statement in consultation with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the President of theBoard of Trade.
60     The Secretary of State for Dominion .//lotiations        Affairs recalled that the concessions/wo had offered birw*   * flsaice^were not accepted by the Cabinet of Eire andprevious kut proved balipfaaiory oitho!P&quot;t* the Government ofd fere nee: fe ,h *U*y^ *rti*M2sh. /srit^- ^u^/V- V-r^o A^^^A^       Ca^Cabinet 18 (38)   Northern Ireland^     The Irish Situation Committee hadConclusion 6.)met in the previous week and this had resulted in a visit from the Prime Minister of Northern Irelandand some of his colleagues.     He thought that theCabinet had better first hear what the Home Secretary hadto say about their attitude.The Home Secretary reported that theGovernment of Northern Ireland had intimated that theoriginal proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom were not acceptable to them and wouldeven have to be opposed actively.     The Cabinet had felt that, in these circumstances, they could not hope to carry these original proposals.     When he and someof his colleagues had met members of the Government ofNorthern Ireland on the previous day, Lord Craigavonhad taken a broad view and had shown himself reluctant to upset the prospect of an agreement.     He had intimated that if he could be given a case that wasdefensible in his Parliament, he would accept it.The difficulties had then boiled down to a matter offinancial concessions.      The Chancellor of theExchequer had taken a sympathetic view of the matterand had agreed to suggestions which, it was thought,would not involve a great deal of money and whichconcerned certain subsidies, a guarantee ofunemployment payments and a possible deficiency ofrevenue in Northern Ireland preventing the government from paying an Imperial contribution     He and theNorthern Ireland Ministers then discussed the pomaiblo
-ootabliohmciTt of munitions rnanufaotuge in NorthernIreland with a view to relieving unemployment there andthe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence had beenhelpful.      The Home Secretary appealed to the ministers at the head of the Service Departments to do their utmost in this matter.     At the last meeting, lord craigavon had described the kind of statement he intended to make.      The drafting had not been very good and the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland had agreedthat/it should he left to officials of the Treasury andthe Board of Trade.      It was hoped in the following week to have an agreed draft.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs expressed the view that, as a result of the conversations with the Government of Northern Ireland, an agreementwith Eire was possible     He then gave an account of thegeneral nature of the agreement.On the subject of defence, we should agree to hand over the defended ports and to evacuate them and weshould abrogate Articles 6 &amp; 7 of the Treaty which gave usoertain rights in those ports.    The Government of Eire g^vs usnothing in return, but he anticipated that the agreement would soon be followed by a vor-y. aatisfactoi?y statement by Mr. de Valera on his defence plans and that, inpractice, we should obtain a good deal of co-operation.On paper, however, this part of the agreement was adverseto us.On finance, the Government of Eire would . makea lump sum payment of  10,000,000 and would confirm thepayment which was already being made of  250,000 a year.Our own special duties would be cancelled as would theretaliatory duties imposed by Eire,
159*In the matter of trade, we should guaranteefree entry to produce from Eire hut would reserve theright to impose quantitative regulation.     In return,we should obtain first a check to their industrialdevelopments including guarantees of free entry on coal and other commodities;    second, an inquiry by aCommission on Prices.     We should have the right to choose which commodities were to be considered first.There would be reductions over a period        our trade would-expand; third,-immediate reductions on certainNopihega--Iroland goods which had been selected by theGovernment of Northern Ireland.     He understood that both the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Agricultureand Fisheries were well pleased with the agreement, whichwould be for three years.His general observations were that it was nota good agreement on paper but that it would open a newchapter in Anglo-Irish relations and that our generositywould have its effects in Ireland.    He warned theCabinet that legislation would be required on defence,finance and trade, and he asked authority to prepare aBill for submission to the Committee of Home Affairs.So far as the programme was concerned, theSecretary of State said his idea was to get Mr. de Valerato London to sign on April 25th;    to publish the white paper the same evening;    to introduce the Bill a day ortwo after and to take the Second Reading on May 5th.In the course of a short discussion, tributeswere paid to the Prime Minister, the Secretary of Sta+efor Dominion Affairs, the Home Secretary, the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the President of the Board of Trade,the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence and theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries for their
respective shares in the conclusion of the agreement.The Prime Minister said that in this kind ofagreement what was not induced was sometimes moreimportant than what was.      Ke attached great importanceto the psychological effect of the conclusion of anotherTreaty of a pacific character&apos; following the italian agreement.      The ^imbassador of the United States of     .   .-America had spoken strongly to him of the valuable effect^of an agreement with Eire.The Cabinet agreed:To approve the proposals of theSecretary of State for DominionAffairs that he should prepare the drafts of the necessary legislation for implementing the anticipatedagreement with Eire for considerationby the Committee of Home Affairs,with a view to possible introductionshortly after April 25th and SecondReading in the House of Commons onMay 5th.
FURTHER defence measures .NAVAL RE-ARMAMENTPROGRAMME.Proposed.Acceleration.(previous reference:Cabinet 16(38), Con-elusion 2 .)&quot; 33 (W) S.7.    The Cabinet had before them a Most secret memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty onthe Naval Re-armament Programme and Measures ofAcceleration proposed, in consequence of theInternational Situation (CoPo-92 (38)), in which he submitted, in conformity with the general decisionof the Cabinet referred to in the margin, thefollowing five measures of defence against air attack which, from the Naval point of view, were of the first importance:-(i) Underground storage of oil fuel:(ii) Underground storage of ammunition.( iii) The re-arming of certain old cruisers and. destroyers with anti-aircraftarmament for trade protection:(iv) The conversion of old. 12-pd.r. gunsinto high-angle armament for the defensive equipment of merchant ships:(v)  Duplication of the RoN. Cordite Factory.In his Memorandum the First Lord, described thepresent position of each o&quot; these items and. attached a financial statement showing the effect of his proposals in regard to them.   He also drew attentionto the importance of the modernisation of ca.pitalships.   All these measures he considered to be ofsuch vital importance that the necessary financial provision should be made irrespective of the figureproposed for the Admiralty ration, - as to the inadequacy of which he had. already made representa-tions to the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.
1 f.91 u &amp;In the course of a short discussion the Ministerfor Go-ordination of Defence pointed out that some of the items included in the First Lord&apos;s Memorandum formed partof the Admiralty Programme which was awaiting the decisionof the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    No one in the cabinet was out of sympathy with any of the proposals of theFirst Lord, but he urged that he should in the firstinstance consider whether they could be included withinthe share of the total expenditure on the defence Servicesof  1,570 millions which he had provisionally assigned tothe Admiralty.    If these or any other proposals of theAdmiralty could not be brought within their rationedexpenditure,  the Cabinet would have to decide as towhether something must be added thereto.    He informed theCabinet that the Secretary of State for War, to whom he hadassigned  70 millions, had asked for  82 millions, which,with the assent of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, hewould in due course ask the Cabinet to approve.The Chancellor of the Exchequer supported theproposal of the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence,  andimpressed upon the Cabinet the extreme importance of notdeparting from the principle of rationing the availableexpenditure to the defence Departments.    If sporadicdecisions were taken,  allowing the ration to be exceededon certain items, the principle would very soon be lost.He felt that the international situation did riot justifyany radical departure from the Scheme in force with the Navy.Our relations with Italy appeared to be on the verge ofmarked Improvement,  and Japan was probably suffering froma certain amount of exhaustion.    He thought that it was generally accepted by the Cabinet that,  while the Navy
must not be disregarded, we ought to concentrate mainly on the Air Force and the Anti-aircraft Defences.prepared to uostpone the consideration of this question,as a month or so would make no great difference.    he wished to emphasise, however,  the danger of considering theneeds of one Service apart from another.  Very shortly hewould have to bring up a further Memorandum on thestandard of naval strength.    In discussing an earlieritem the Cabinet had been reminded that fawycased/foodsuoolies wew important, m-a-miy from a psychological pointof view.    That showed that the Navy was as important as ever for safeguarding food sur/olies.    Without this aircraft would not avail.The Prime Minister said that the country fully realised the importance of naval protect ion, but he asked the FirstLord to postpone consideration of his Memorandum until hehad gone into the possibility of including the itemswithin the expenditure proposed for the Admiralty.In reply to a question as to the cost of expediting the modernisation of capital ships, the First Lord said the cost would not be great provided that labour could befound for the dockyards concerned.The Cabinet agreed(a) To invite the First Lord of the admiralty to examine as to whether the proposals inhis Memorandum (C*P. 92 (38)) could bebrought within the share provisionallyallotted to the Admiralty by the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence out of thetotal sum of  1,570 millions to be expended by the Defence Departmentsduring the next five years.The First Lord of the Admiralty said he was
(b) To postpone the decision on C.P.  92(38)until the procedure proposed under (a)should be carried out.(c) That the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence and the Minister of Labour should consider the means by which the necessary labour could be found for the dockyardsconcerned in the acceleration of the modernisation of capital ships.
! this AIR PRO-gRAMME.I proposals forAccelerationof.(previous preference:Cabinet 18(38), Con-clusion 8.)a   24-fa4, )IS&apos;8.    The Cabinet resumed their consideration ofthe following Memoranda on the subject of Proposalsfor the Acceleration of the Air Programme -CP.-86 (38),by the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence,and cp.-87 (38), by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer -which had been remitted, at the Meeting mentionedin the margin, tomhe Prime Minister,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence,The Secretary of State for Air,with a request that they should, endeavour to prepare a recommendation for the present Meeting of theCabinet .The Secretary of State for Air informed theCabinet that the Ministers referred to above had held a long meeting, but were not yet in a positionto submit a Programme.    The vital thing was to produce the maximum number of aircraft within the next twoyears.    As a result of the deliberations of theMinisters, he had discussed the matter with Sir CBruce Gardner   and he was now discussing with aircraft manufacturers.    He believed that by a greateffort by the firms and with goodwill, his programmed could be carried out so far as actual constructionof the machines was concerned,  and that there wouldbe no difficulty on the side of material.&quot;    The main difficulty was labour, and everyone with whom hehad discussed the matter had agreed that thediscussions on this subject should be dealt with inthe districts as soon as possible.    He had arranged
1GGfor Mr. J. G-. Weir, accompanied by a senior officer of theRoyal Air Force and a test pilot, to sail in the following week to the United States of America in order to obtainprecise details as to what could be obtained there and by what dates..    He was particularly anxious to obtain ageneral reconnaissance machine which would be of valueboth to the Navy and to the Air Force.    The mission wouldtelegraph the results of their enquiries, and it would benecessary for him to be able to obtain prompt decisions in order to reply.    Tt was proposed that the mission should return through Canada,  and that Mr. Weir shouldassess the possibilities of manufacture in that Dominion.He did not expect much from Canada at the moment, but ithad always been realised that Canada might provide amost important war potential for the construction of aeroplanes, particularly in view of recent developments in the range of aircraft which would be able to fly the atlantic and thus avoid the delays of packing andre-assembling.    It was no use planning, however, untilthe capacity of the Canadian industry could be assessed,including the management.Personnel, however, was the most urgent matter for the reason that, owing to the rapidity of development,the Air Force had not been able to create a reserve.Owing to the expert character of much of the work,personnel requirements could not be improvised after theoutbreak of war.    He understood that the Prime Minister andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer approved that in the next two years   he   should     be allowedvto enter the maximumnumbers.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that ifthe Air Ministry would get in touch with the Treasury and submit their proposals, they should receive authority forthe recruitment of personnel for carrying out theirdifficult, and he thought the Treasury would have to have some kind of figure.    The Programme, however, must notbe held up for lack of personnel.The Cabinet agreed:-(a) That the Secretary of State for Air should place his Department in touch with theTreasury,  who would have authority to approve the recruitment of the personnelrequired to carry out his proposed Programme,which must not be held up for lack of personnel.(b) To take note that the Secretary of Statefor Air would communicate with the Ministersdealing with this question on behalf of theCabinet as soon as his negotiations with aircraft manufacturers enabled him to makethe proposals.(c) To take note that the Secretary of State forAir would require rapid decisions as soon ashe obtained information from the missionthat was leaving for the United States ofAmerica.
FURTHER defence measures.NATIONALREGISTER.(Voluntary).(previous reference -*Cabinet 16(38), Con-conclusion 2(*)&quot;.)9.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Labour (CP.-91 (38)) pointing outthat for some time past the creation of a. VoluntaryNational Register had been actively canvassed, invarious quarters, and. giving reasons for his vie^that it was inadvisable to emba.rk on such a scheme.After describing action of an analogous kind already taken by various Government Departments, the minister suggested that the following further steps should betaken:-(l) To survey the field and see whether there are any other requirements forwhich volunteers should be enrollednow or, possibly, for which membersof the public should, be encouraged to prepare themselves:(2) To take the necessary action for obtaining enrolment and givingadvice in any such cases;    and(3) To co-ordinate all these activities;also that a Committee of Departmental representativescovering the Departments likely to be chiefly concerned should be set up for the purpose of co-ordination andto some extent also of stimulation and advice.If desired, he was prepared, to provide the Chairmanfor such a Committee from his Department, as theactivities in question were closely related, to thosewhich might have to be performed, in time of war bythe proposed Ministry of National Service, of whichthe Ministry of Labour was the parent Department.In the course of a short discussion theattention of the Cabinet was drawn to the risk thatthe work of the proposed Interdepartmental Committeewould clash with that of the Man Power Committee,whose organisation either covered or was capableof covering the ground.
The Cabinet agreed:-(a) That for the reasons given in the Memorandumby the Minister of Lab our,  there should beno voluntary National Register.(b) That the proposal for the establishment bythe Ministry of Labour of an interdepartmental committee should be examined by the ministers principally concerned in Man Power under thegeneral guidance of the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence.

APPENDIX I.THE ANGLO-ITALIAN AGREEMENT.The Agreement will consist, in the first place, of a protocol, to which a number of instruments will beannexed.     The protocol will refer to the decision ofthe Governments of the United Kingdom and of Italy toundertake conversations in order to reach agreement on questions of mutual concern, the two Governments beinganimated by the desire to place the relations between them on a solid and lasting basis and to contribute to thegeneral cause of peace and security.      It will explain&quot;that the agreements and declarations annexed to it shallbe regarded as separate and self-contained instruments and that they shall take effect on such date as the twoGovernments shall together determine.The protocol will also provide that, as soon as the instruments annexed to it take effect, negotiations willbe opened in which the Egyptian Government will be invitedto participate where necessary with a view to a definitiveagreement on the boundaries between the Sudan, Kenya andBritish Somaliland on the one side, and Italian EastAfrica on the other, and with regard to certain other questions, such as trade f affecting the relations between those territories.The instruments attached to the protocol willprovide for,(a) The reaffirmation of the MediterraneanDeclaration of 2nd January, 1937, and the Exchange of notes of 31st December, 1936, regarding the status quo in the Western Mediterranean,
(b) The exchange of military information withregard to forces stationed in or based on overseas possesions of either party in or bordering on theMediterranean, the Red Sea or the Gulf of Aden, andother territories covering a wide area in North EastAfrica;   and advance notification of any decision toprovide new naval or air bases in the Mediterraneaneast of longitude 19D east and in the Red Sea orapproaches thereto,(c) An agreement relating to certain areas in theNear East which, in particular, will bind each party to respect the integrity and independence of Saudi arabia and the Yemen,(d) A reaffirmation of the intention of the ItalianGovernment to respect their obligation towards theUnited Kingdom with regard to Lake Tsana,(e) The non-compulsion of natives in Italian EastAfrica to military duties other than local policing and territorial defence,(f) An undertaking by the Italian government regarding the free exercise of religion and the treatmentof British religious bodies in Italian East Africa,(g) A reaffirmation by both parties oftheir intention to abide by the Suez Canal convention of the 29th October,  1888, guaranteeing at all times and for all Powers the free use of the canal.
A number of other subjects will be dealt with by-exchanges of letterso      Thus, Count Ciano will inform LordPerth, in a letter, of the Italian Government^ decision toreduce the Italian forces in Libya by 1,000 men a week untilthe Italian-Libyan effectives reach peace strength, this reduction constituting an ultimate diminution of thoseeffectives by not less than half the numbers present in libya when the conversations commenced.      In another letterCount Ciano will signify the intention of his Governmentto accede to the London Naval Treaty of 1936 as soon as the instruments annexed to the protocol come into force, and inthe meantime to act in conformity with the provisions ofthe above-mentioned Treaty.     With regard to Spain, count ciano will write to Lord Perth confirming the ItalianGovernment&apos;s adherence to the United Kingdom formula forthe proportional evacuation of the foreign volunteers from spain and pledging the Italian Government to apply suchevacuation at the moment and on conditions to be determinedby the Non-intervention Committee on the basis of the above-mentioned formula;    he will reaffirm that if this evacuationhas not been completed at the moment of the termination ofthe Spanish civil war, all remaining Italian volunteers willforthwith leave Spanish territory and all Italian war materialwill simultaneously be withdrawn;    and, further, he willrepeat his previous assurance that the Italian Governmenthave no territorial or political aims, and seek no privileged
economic position,  in or with regard to Metropolitan Spain,the Balearic Islands, any of the Spanish possessionsoverseas, or the Spanish zone of Morocco,    and that theyhave no intention whatever of keeping any armed forces inany of the said territories.      In his reply to this letterLord Perth will state that His Majesty&apos;s Government regard a settlement of the Spanish question as a pre-requisite ofthe entry into force of the agreement &quot;between them and theItalian Government.     With regard to Ethiopia, Lord Perthwill, in the same letter, inform Count Ciano that HisMajesty&apos;s Government, &quot;being desirous that such obstacles asmay at present be held to impede the freedom of member states as regards recognition of Italian sovereignty overEthiopia should be removed? intend to take steps at theforthcoming meeting of the Council of the League of nations for the purpose of clarifying the situation of member states in this regard..Finally, there will be an agreement (which, in respectof the Sudan, will be signed by Egypt as well as by theUnited Kingdom and Italy) providing for good relations onthe frontiers of Lthiopia during such time as negotiationsregarding the specific Ethiopian questions referred to inthe protocol can be completed-      This agreement will also,in view of the Italian decree of 1936 abolishing slaveryin Ethiopia, provide for the co-operation of therespective parties to prevent the evasion of the anti-slavery laws of their respective territories.       It will further provide that the nationals of the one party shallnot be enrolled in the military formations of the other party in East African territories.
It will &quot;be seen, therefore, that while the Agreement(consisting of a Protocol and annexes) will be signed, we hope, this week, it will not enter into force until &quot;such date as the two Governments shall together determine&quot;.    Thismeans that on our side we shall determine that date by-reference to the Spanish question and that only when that question   has been settled to our satisfaction shall we beprepared to allow the agreement to enter into force.    Ontheir side, the Italian Government will determine that date by reference to our recognition of Italian sovereignty in Ethiopia.FOREIGN OFFICE.11th April , 1938.
