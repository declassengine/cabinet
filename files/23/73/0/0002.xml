1.   The Prime Minister said he was anxious tocomplete the business of the Cabinet before 12 Noonas the Irish Situation Committee was consideringcertain important questions and had had to adjournowing to the assembly of the Cabinet.   He wished tore*-assemble the Committee   at the hour stated.
UNEMPLOYMENT .2.   The Cabinet agreed  The HungerMarchers .That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows -(previous reference:Cabinet 56,(38), Con-ffilus ion 1,)F.R.The Home Secretary (In the Chair),The Minister of Health,The Minister of Labour,The Secretary of State forScotland,The Attorney-General,The Lord Advocate -should meet to consider questions relating to hunger-marchers.
THE LONDON 5.PASSENGERTRANSPORTBILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 55(33), Con-elusion 7.)The Cabinet agreed to a proposal bythe Prime Minister that the Ministerof Transport should be authorised to consult the Secretary of State forthe Colonies and, when possible, thePresident of the Board of Tradevbefore accepting any amendments tothe London Passenger Transport Billinvolving substantial questions ofprinciple.
JCHURIA *5 Lytton)ort.jvious*erence:cabinet 60I). Con-is ion 2.)4. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C.P.-4C4(32)) entitled &quot;The Lytton Report:    Japan and theLeague of Nations&quot;.   In this Memorandum the Secretaryof State examined the Report of the Lytton Commission,which had reached the conclusion (among others) thatthe creation of Manchukuo was not due to thespontaneous action of Manchurian inhabitants, but tothe organised intervention of Japan.    In these circum-stances the Secretary of State did not see how theCouncil of the League could be expected to do otherthan accept the unanimous Report of its own Commission,and he anticipated that this would be the firstdecision reached at Geneva.    If the Commissionsfindings of fact were accepted, Japan appeared to beresponsible for a disregard of the Nine-Power Treaty,by the terms of which she, along with the other signatories, was bound to respect tine integrity ofChina.   This was also Mr Stimson&apos;s view.   The Leagueorgans which were considering the matter were likelyto find it very difficult not to pronounce what amountsto a condemnation of Japan.   This, however, might produce embarrassing and dangerous results, includingthe possibility of Japan leaving the League.   TheSecretary of State&apos;a conclusion was set forth in thelast paragraph of-his Memorandum as follows:-&quot;In these difficult circumstances itseems to me that British policy mustkeep in mind the following desiderata;though it will be difficult to pursue&apos;them all at the same time.   We ought toact as a loyal member of the League and avoid, as far as possible, bringingdown on ourselves the condemnationwhich would attach to isolated orprominent individual action.    It isimpossible to abandon loyalty to theLeague and its principles merely becauseJapan would prefer this:    we must explain to Japan that the course we take ispro. League and not anti Japan.   Even if
other considerations did not compelthis course, we have to remember theserious consequences to our trade ofantagonising China. In fact, we muststrive to be fair to both sides.   Butwe must not involve ourselves introuble with Japan.&quot;The view was expressed that the last sentence of the above paragraph was the most important, butit was generally recognised that the matter was adelicate one which must on no account be mentionedpublicly or talked about.The Cabinet appreciated the difficulty theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs would have in carrying out his conclusion as quoted above.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs pointed out that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs could be counted on to keep representativesof the Dominions at Geneva informed as to his attitude on the Lytton Report.   He stated, however,that Mr Bruce (Australia) and Sir Thomas Wilford(New Zealand) had not gone to Geneva, and heconsulted the Cabinet as to the best manner of keeping them in touch with out? policy on thisquestion.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To receive the Report of the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs (C*P.-404(32)):(b) That the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should beauthorised to speak to Mr Bruceand Sir Thomas Wilford on thelines of the above Memorandum,without showing them the Memo-randuii or using its preciselanguage.
3.05/ The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Prime Minister, on behalf of the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (C,P.-405 (32)), coveringtelegrams -which had passed between the Foreign Officeand His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Moscow on the subjectof a speech by Manuilski, a member of the Presidiumof the Communist International, addressed to theCommittee of Action of the Moscow branch of theAil-Union Communist Party.    In the course of this correspondence attention had been drawn by the ambassador to an article in the &quot;Izvestiya&quot;, theofficial organ of the Central Executive Committee ofthe Soviet Government, accusing His Majesty&quot;sGovernment of forging evidence against the SovietGovernment in order to justify the denunciation ofthe Trade Agreement.   The Prime Minister proposed tosend an instruction to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in moscow to take the following action:-   to insist that no further remarks of the kind made by Manuilskishould be made in future, and on an apology for the language of the &quot;Izvestiya&quot;:    to point out that future indulgence in these malevolent tactics wouldconfuse the issue between        commercial negotiations and propaganda:    and to act on his own suggestion to make a strong protest, to be accompanied by onefinal and categorical assurance that the policy ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government is to promote trade relations on a permanent and stable basis, and by a request that the Soviet Government state clearly intheir reply what their policy towards us really is.
In the course of the discussion the Secretary &quot;ofState for War informed the Cabinet that he was. being pressed by Lord Denbigh to know if a Debate could take place in the House of Lords at an early date.The Prime Minister thought that it would not bein the public interest to have a Debate at thepresent moment.   The absence of the Foreign secretary was one reason for avoiding it.   He asked theSecretary of State for War to do his best to staveoff a Debate.The Cabinet were reminded of the difficulty whichhad arisen with the Soviet Government owing to their refusal to allow the Diplomatic Corps any longer topurchase from the shop maintained by the soviet authorities for their own officials .   It was explainedthat, for technical reasons, this difficulty operated with special harshness on the United. Kingdom repre-sentatives.   The Cabinet were informed that a strongeffort had been made to create a common front bythe Diplomatic Corps in Moscow, but the Italians had refused to co-operate, and some others were lukewarm.There was no certainty that we should succeed in this,but the Prime Minister said that   he had the matter in hand and would be consulting the Foreign Officeabout it at once.Towards the end of the Meeting a fresh telegramfrom Sir E. Ovey (No .219) was handed to the PrimeMinister and read by him to the Cabinet.   This telegram was felt to confirm the general view of the Cabinet,and the conclusions reached earlier in the meeting were slightly strengthened after hearing its terms *The Cabinet agreed  (a) To authorise the Prime Minister to instruct the Foreign Office to proceed on the lines of the:    Memorandum C.P.-405:
(b) To take note that it was the PrimeMinister&apos;s intention, in the capacity of Acting Foreign Secretary,to see the Russian Ambassador andto make a communication to him on &apos;the same lines as the communication to be made to the Soviet government by Sir E. Ovey:(c) To take note that the Prime minister would see the Foreign Office as soonas possible on the question of the refusal of the right of purchaseat the Soviet store for theirofficials:(d) That the Secretary of State for War,as Leader of the House of Lords,should do his best to avoid a debate on the subject,
EgRLIAMENTARYWfsiNESS./Legislativeffqr&apos;1932-33Mission.Breviousi Reference:Cabinet 52I (32), Con-1 elusion 6,)6* The Cabinet had before them the Conclusionsof the Committee of Home Affairs (H*A.C. 9th Conclu-sions (32)) covering a List of Bills constituting theLegislative Programme of Parliament in the new session the Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that,from the point of view of business, the circumstancesof the present Session might prove rather peculiar.He was anxious that his colleagues should have all their Bills ready so that they might be slipped inas opportunity afforded.    Also, he was anxious tosupply the House of Lords with work and hoped thatsome of these   Bills might be introduced in that house.The Secretary of State for War, as Leader of theHouse of Lords, emphasised the importance of intro-ducing some Bills, if possible, in the House ofLords early in the Session.   He hoped that the Houseof Commons would do its best to avoid throwing onthe House of Lords a number of first-class Billsat the tail-end of the Session, which alwaysoccasioned protests and objection.The Cabinet took note of the PrimeMinister^ request.I
U POLICY.^previous^ference:Cabinet 61(88), Con-elusion la*)7.  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (CP.-401(32)) reporting, for the information of the Cabinet,the action which had been taken since the cabinet discussed the question of Meat Policy on November2nd,The Memorandum included a recommendation that,as the next immediate step in the development ofthe Government&apos;s Meat Policy, a Re-organisationCommission for Fat Stock should be set up under theAgricultural Marketing Act, 1931, as proposed in his previous Memorandum C.P.-368 (32), Paragraph 16.The Secretary of State for Scotland had already taken corresponding action in Scotland, but was reluctant that the Scottish Commission should be merged at this stage into a Great Britain Commission.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries therefore proposed that the Commission which he recommendedshould be entrusted with the task of preparing ascheme applicable only in England and Wales, but thatits Terms of Reference should be drafted on the linesof the Lane-Fox Commission, and that, in liaison with the Scottish Commission and with NorthernIreland, it should be inaposition to consider the wider United Kingdom aspect of the problem.The Secretary of State for Scotland informed the Cabinet that the Scottish Commission would bedealing only with marketing and not control.   Inthe matter of control it would have to be linked up in some way with the English Commission,In reply to questions, the Minister of Agricul-ture and Fisheries informed the Cabinet that what he had in mind was a Commission for Meat correspond-in g to the Lane-Fox Committee on Bacon.
The Prime Minister explained that the proposed commission would be advisory in character, and theGovernment would keep in its hands all executive power.   He hoped that the various Commissions would keep in mind the position some years hence.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesexplained that one of the objects of having theseCommissions was to take a long view of the situation.He asked the Cabinet for sanction for the prepara-tion of a Bill.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the proposal of theMinister of Agriculture andFisheries for the appointmentof a Re-organisation commission for Fat Stock under the agricultural marketing Act, 19 31, the Commissionto be entrusted with the task of preparing a scheme applicable onlyin England and Wales, but to keepin liaison with the ScottishCommission and with NorthernIreland:(b) That the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries should be authorisedto draft a Bill setting forth his proposals and to give the cabinet as much time as possible for its consideration.-11-
OOMMERCTAL^SoTlATIONSith foreignountries.previous reference:Cabinet 5J$(33), Oon-elusion ?.)S, The Cabinet had before them a memorandum -um bythe President of the Board of Trade (C.P.-403 (32))on the subject of Commercial Negotiations with ForeignCountries.   Negotiations for Trade Agreements withthe Scandinavian countries had now started.   the presidents aim was to secure (l) arrangements forincreased use of British coal by the various Scandina-vian industries;    (S&quot;) security for the maintenanceof what in general are comparatively low rates of duty for other British exports of importance; and(3) in a limited number of cases actual reductions of Duty where rates higher than the usual level areimposed on important lines of British trade.   after explaining the principles on which he proposed towork, the President of the Board of Trade warned theCabinet that, as in all tariff negotiations, we couldnot expect to secure the results we desired without having to make some concessions which would not be welcomed by some of the industries affected.   Heillustrated this by the case of fish.   We wereprecluded by the Ottawa Agreements from reducingthe Duty below 10 per cent, but an undertaking onour part to maintain the existing 10 per cent. Dutyon fish imported from Scandinavian countries wouldcertainly be pressed for.   He gave various instances of tariff reductions that were likely to be demanded,but did not propose to commit the Government until he was in a position to present a complete picture of the advantages and possible disadvantages whichmight result from the conclusion of any particularAgreement.
The Secretary of State for Scotland emphasised the fact that the negotiations concerned not onlythe trawling section of the fishing industry,referred to in the President of the Board of Trade&apos;sMemorandum (C.P.-403 (32)), but also, perhaps evenmore acutely, the herring fishermen, who were adifferent section of the industry, working and marketing their catch under quite different condi-tions,   The herring .       industry was subjected tovery acute competition from Norway, but there was reason to believe that the British winter herringsmight oust Norwegian imports if a substantial additional Duty were imposed on the Norwegianherring.   mhe Scottish herring industry wassuffering from grave depression, and he felt someapprehensions at the proposal that the Duty shouldnot be raised above 10 per cent.After discussion,  the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the President of the Boardof Trade should continue thenegotiations, but should not commit the Government until he was in a position to presenta complete picture of theadvantages and possible disad-vantages which might result fromthe conclusion of any particularAgreement:(b) That he should keep in touchwith the Secretary of Statefor Scotland and the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries.
housing policy.9. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Health (CP.-386 (32)) asking for a(previous reference:Cabinet 60(32), Con-clusion 6.)decision on Housing Policy. After setting forth indetail the present position, he asked authority for(a) Negotiations with the building societies and the Local authorities with a view to the provision andownership by the Building Societiesof working-class dwellings:(b) Introduction of legislation forterminating subsidy under the acts of 1924 and 1931, and for consolida-tion of subsidy on the lines proposedby the Committee on Local Expenditure,whose Report was attached in C.P,-399(32) .The Cabinet agreed -(i) That the Memorandum by the Ministerof Health (CP.-386 (32)), togetherwith the Memorandum that the Secretaryof State for Scotland was preparing,should be referred in the firstinstance to a Cabinet committee composed as follows:-ipBRS RESTRICTION,I(Previous(4,44S&apos;aM&apos;net-2-8cor--Q4us4-on-4-,)trueThe Minister of Health,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,^he Secretary of State forDominion Affairs,The Secretary of State for Scotland&apos;That the Minister of Health shouldhave authority to prepare in draft a,/KR^m-ifo^RoeHsrs^frfew? Bill, in case as the result of the Committee&apos;s&apos;enquiry, the Cabinet should desireits introduction.
NATIONALITY OFMARRIF  WOMEN.(previous reference:Cabinet SO(32), Con-elusion 7.)M:10.The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Home Secretary (C.P.-39^ (52)) on thesubject of the Nationality of Married Women.The Home Secretary had come to the conclusion thatthere are very strong objections in principle, bothof a constitutional and of a legal character, tothe proposals submitted by his predecessor in cp.-162 (32) to relieve British-born women whobecame aliens on marriage from the disabilitiesattaching to aliens.    In all the circumstances, theHome Secretary thought it would be most expedient to introduce early next Session a Bill to enablethe Hague Convention to be ratified, and he asked the approval of the Cabinet to the preparation of aBill on these lines, including certain amendments suggested in the Memorandum.In the course of a short discussion the cabinet were reminded that the ballot for Private Members&apos;Bills was being made the same day and it was very probable that one or more Private Bills would beintroduced on this subject.In the circumstances, the Cabinet felt that thebest course would be for the Home Secretary to watch the development of opinion in parliament before proceeding to draft his Bill.

He isdisappointed that all prospect of meeting with Herriot and Prime minister should&quot;be put off till December 1stand urges that Herriot should paypreliminary visit here this weekbefore Neurath goes on Saturday.I promised to support this request,but most important thing is tosecure definitely meeting of five powers in Geneva for December 1st,by which time Neurath will have returned.    If this could be suffi-ciently assured it would haveadmirable effect to announce theintention in advance.&quot;He himself was willing to go to Geneva if there was any object to be served thereby.The Secretary of State for Air, after hearing theabove telegram, suggested that the German Governmentwas manoeuvring itself into a position where itwould be able to claim to its own credit any successDisarmamentthat might be achieved by the/Conference.
