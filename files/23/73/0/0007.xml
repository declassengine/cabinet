FOREIGN 1,   The Prime Minister informed his colleaguesAFFAIRS.that he had had a telephone conversation that morningwith the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, atGeneva,    In consequence of the fall of the FrenchGovernment he had asked the Secretary of State toreturn at once, and he would he hack in London this evening.   The Prime Minister had not thought it advisable to send out the Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State, and he said that Mr Gadogan, to whose workhe paid a warm tribute, would do his best to carry on.s oonHe hoped, however, that the League itself might/ adjourn the various questions in which we were interested.
huCHURIA! itne Lyttonport.previous reference:Cabinet 64[32), Con-elusion 4.)F.R.g. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C.P.-431(52)) giving an account of the discussions on Manchuriaat Geneva, which had followed very much the course that he had. anticipated in his earlier Memorandum(C.P.-404 (32)). of November 19th.   The Secretary ofState pointed out that the question was now reaching the critical stages ,   He could not formulate questions for the Cabinet to answer at the moment, but would be grateful for any advice and guidance.    He added &quot;I ammore and more impressed with the feeling that theManchurian question is going to give us, both atGeneva and at home, a great deal of trouble before it is disposed of&quot;.The Prime Minister said that in his conversationwith the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that morning he had learned that the Sub-Committee of theCommittee of Nineteen, appointed to draft a Resolution,had got so far as to have arrived at a first draft,which had been produced mainly by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, with Mr GadoganTs ass ist-ance.    In this draft, conciliation was proposed first.Sir John Simon had told the Sub-Committee that he must insist on this, and had succeeded in bringing them, some distance towards that point of view.   Therewas to be a further meeting today.
persia,t * *Ihe Threat tothe Anglo-persian oil company.(previous reference:Cabinet 65(32),Conclusion 3).F..R..3,The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the threat to the Anglo-persian oil Company:-A Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (CP. 430(32)) as promisedin their Interim Report (CP. 419(32))that had been before the Cabinet atthe meeting referred to in the margin.This Report dealt with the concertedNaval, Military and Air action whichmight be necessary for the Local Defenceof the Anglo-Persian Oil Company&apos;sproperty in South Persia if the situation deteriorated, and the Persian Governmentshowed signs of military action for the seizure of the oil wells.      In a coveringnote to the detailed Report, which hadbeen prepared under their instructions bythe Joint Planning Sub-Committee, theChiefs of Staff pointed out that the Reportdid not deal with the possibility of a sudden coup-de-main on Abadan by the Persianmilitary forces at Ahwaz.     The only measure which would be taken in anticipation of sucha contingency would be the strengthening ofthe available naval forces by ordering H.M.S.Enterprise and H.M.S. Emerald from India tothe head of the Gulf.     This was a matter forHis Majesty&apos;s Government to decide.A Memorandum by the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(C.P.-428 (32)) as to the action to betaken on the Persian Governments reply,which was annexed to the Memorandum.    ThePersian Government, after stating theirgrievances against the Company and thegrounds on which they considered themselvesentitled to cancel the Persian Oil Company&apos;sconcession, said that in their opinion the Optional Clause does not cover thecircumstances of this particular case;and they concluded by intimating their intention themselves to bring the matter before the Council of the League, on theground of the &quot;threats and pressure whichhave been directed against&quot; Persia by thiscountry.    Should the Persian Governmentadopt this course Persia would automaticallyacquire the right to demand the suspension of any proceedings instituted before thePermanent Court in consequence of a reservation which, she had made in accepting the Optional Clause. . In thesecircumstances the Foreign Office recom-mended that Fis Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould, if possible,  forestall thePersian Government by taking the initiative in having the matter referred to the Councilof the League under Article XV of theCovenant.J.
A Note by the Secretary to the Cabinetnotifying an interim decision by theLord President of the Council that ifany matter should arise in connectionwith Persian affairs requiring immediate consideration, it should be referred atonce to the Middle East Organisation.A suggestion was made that it might have been better if the Cabinet had decided in the first instance to refer the matter to the Council of the League ofNations under Article XV.   The Cabinet were reminded,however, of the circumstances in which their previous decision had been taken.    It had been considered essential to prevent Persia from following up theircancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company&apos;sconcession by occupying the oilfields..   consequently it had been decided that, if the Law officers of theCrown had no legal objection to this course, an appeal should be made to the Court of International Justiceat The Hague, and that at the same time an InterlocutoryJudgment should be obtained to forestall action bythe Persian Government against the oilfields.   Now it transpired that if either party to the dispute went tothe Council first the case would be outside thejurisdiction&apos;of the Hague Court.    Consequently theForeign Office now proposed that we should take theinitiative in referring the question to the council under Article XV, in which case, if the matter couldnot be dealt with immediately, the Council would beasked to take steps to ensure the maintenance of thestatus quo on the oilfields pending a settlement.The Cabinet felt that this was the right course.The question was raised as to whether this decision could be announced in answer to a Private notice question the same afternoon.   The Cabinet felt thatthis was a matter which must be left for decisionafter consultation with the Foreign Office.    It was
inadvisable to make any announcement which might enable the Persian Government to forestall us atGeneva.    It might be better, therefore, to refer thematter to Geneva with the least possible delay, and make the announcement immediately after.In regard to the Report by the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee, the Cabinet considered that at thepresent moment it would be inadvisable to make anymovements of our Naval forces beyond those which werebeing carried out according to programme, and that inthese circumstances H.j/.S. ENTERPRISE and H .M.S.EMERALDshould not be moved to the head of the Gulf.It was pointed out to the Cabinet that the Reportby the Chiefs of Staff Committee had only dealt verybriefly, in paragraphs 35 and 36, with the measures that would be required if it was eventually foundnecessary to occupy the oilfields area against Persianopposition, and the question was raised as to whetherthis contingency, which it was hoped was very remote,ought to be explored in greater detail.&apos;   The Cabinet were reminded that operations of sucha nature, involving two or three Divisions, would,in the present state of our mobilisation arrangements,require the expenditure of considerable sums of money.It was felt that at the moment it would suffice ifthe Secretary cf State for War would inform theChief of the Imperial General Staff that the matter had been raised at the Cabinet and that he should keepthe whole subject under close observation.The Cabinet realised that the whole questionrequired to be kept under the most careful scrutiny,more particularly owing to the possibility that theRussian Soviet Government were instigating the persians in this matter.
The Prime Minister said that he proposed to ask the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, on his return, to give his personal attention to this dispute.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the proposals of thePermanent Under-Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, as set forth inC.P.-428 (32) and summarised above,for an immediate reference of thedispute with Persia to the Councilof the League of Nations underArticle XV of the Covenant, thePersian Government being informed that the same time that we were doing so:(b) That the Foreign Office should advise the Prime Minister as to the earliest moment at which an announcement ofthis decision could, safely be made inParliament:(c) To take note of the further Report ofthe Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee(C .P.-430 ( 32)):(d) That at the present moment it would be inadvisable, from a political point ofview, to make any emergency movements of H.M. Ships to the head of the persian gulf, and that no orders to that effect should be given to H.M.S. enterprise and H.M.S. EMERALD, but that theAdmiralty should keep in close touchwith the Foreign Office on this question:(e) That the Secretary of State for war should invite the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff to keep in close touchwith the situation in Persia, in case it should become necessary to study incloser detail the contingencies referredto in paragraphs 35 and 36 of the Reportby the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee:(f) To approve the emergency arrangementsmade provisionally by the Lord Presidentpf the Council, as set forth in C.P.-427(32), that if any matter should a^isein connection with Persian affairsrequiring immediate considerationit should be considered at once bythe Middle East Organisation..
4.     The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the provision to be made in the indian constitution against Commercial and Shipping Discrlmina-tion: -A most secret Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for India (CP. 424(32)), setting forth alternative Clauses on whicha difference of opinion had arisen betweenon the one side,the Foreign Office, dominions office, the Colonial Office and the Boardof Trade and on the other side, the IndiaOffice, Sir Claud Schuster and Sir MauriceGwyer.     The pros and cons of the question were set forth In detail in Memorandaattached to the Secretary of StatefsMemorandum.      In the first alternative itwas proposed to take powers so as to provide protection for the commercial and financial interests of the Dominions and Colonies aswell as of the United Kingdom.     In thesecond alternative of the United Kingdom only.A Memorandum by the President of the Boardof Trade (CP. 432(32)), asking the Cabinetto take certain decisions for the protectionof British shipping against discrimination.The Secretary of State for India informed theCabinet that his full intention was to provide for theprotection of British Shipping against discrimination,and he was advised that this was already provided forin the draft Constitution.     He was prepared, however,that this subject should be discussed inter-departmentallyIn order to ensure that the President of the Board ofTrade&apos;s requirements in this respect were met.hadAfter the arguments on both sides of - thfc main question/been stated by the Secretary of State for India, theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs, the Secretaryof State for the Colonies and the Lord Chancellor Indetail^the Secretary of State for War said he had been impressed with the difficulty of doing what the&apos;ForeignOffice, Dominions Office, Colonial Office and Board ofTrade desired.      It is true that under alternative (1)if a Dominion or Colony put Indian subjects at a:itutionisionnstercial andppingcrimination.eviouserence:inet 65(52),elusion 5).FX
disadvantage within their own territory,India would havethe right to discriminate in the same way against Britishsubjects domiciled in that Dominion or Colony.     That,however, was not quite what India required.      For example,supposing South Africa or Kenya were to discriminate, asin fact they did, against Indians residing there inconsiderable numbers it would be of no use to India tohave the power of exercising similar discrimination againstSouth Africans or residents of Kenya in India, the numberof whom is very small.     What India required was to beable to adopt some other kind of discrimination whichor Kenyawould induce South Africa/not to discriminate againstIndians.     That was the reason for the compromise thathe had suggested, and which was referred to in CP. 424(32),though he realised the objections of that particular plan.In the course of further discussion it transpired that the difficulties of India arose almost entirely with south Africa and Kenya Colony.The Secretary of State for the Colonies s\iggested thepossibility that provision might be made to enableDominions and Colonies to adhere by special agreement tothe arrangements made between the United Kingdom and Indiato avoid commercial and shipping discrimination.     Atfirst sight he was inclined to think that any Colony thatdid not discriminate against India might be permitted to adhere.The President of the Board of Education said that, ifthis suggestion meant provisions by which accompanyingand correlative agreements should be capable of beingmade between India and the Dominions or Colonies, he was satisfied, but what 7fas essential was that such agreements should be freely entered Into by India, and that we shouldnot try to place a limitation upon India when we are unable
to secure for her in Dominions or Colonies the equlvaladvantage which the limitation ought to carry, and whiIndia would have a right to expect.The Secretary of State for India said that at. firsight he was attracted by the proposal by the Secretarof State for the Colonies, but before committing himsehe would like to discuss the matter with his experts.The Cabinet agreed;-la)  To take note that British shippingwas intended and believed to be covered by the reciprocity arrangement and that if it was not steps should be take to cover it:(b) That the Secretary of State for india should consider the proposal that provision should be made in the indian constitution to enable a Dominion orColony to adhere by mutual agreement to the arrangements made for the avoidance of commercial discrimination by Indiaagainst the United Kingdom, and thats ifnecessary,  the subject should be discussed by the Cabinet Committee.(The Prime Minister , who was indisposed,, left the Cabinet at this point).
5.     The Cabinet had before them, a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for India (CP.-423 (32)) givingthe present position with regard to the separation of burma from India.    The result of the recent election,which gave a large majority to the anti-separationists,had come as a complete surprise not only to the Govern-ment but also to Burman political leaders, whetherseparationists or anti-separationists .   Explanationswere given with some detail to show the electoraldevices by which this had been brought about, largelyunder the inspiration of the Indian Congress .   Theposition was summarised as follows:- -&quot;To p\it the position as summarily aspossible, the people of Burma havebeen asked to choose between twoclearly stated alternatives.    Of thefour main parties into which theirrepresentatives fall, only one, andthat the least representative,  isprepared definitely to choose either of these two alternatives .   The other three all wish to choose something  each something different from the other  which is not offered.   There is, indeed,a fifth group   the 6 or 7 who posedas neutrals in the election;    they areIndians and would certainly vote forunconditional entry into the IndianFederation; but they do not repre-sent Burman feeling at all, but onlythe feeling of Indians in Burma&quot;.Thus the result of the recent election in Burma had given no indication of the desire of the people of burma, and so long as it was uncertain whether or notBurma was to become a unit of the Indian Federationit was impossible to conclude the task of filling inthe details of the Indian Federal Constitution.Unless, therefore,  progress with the Indian Constitu-tion was held up by intrinsic difficulties, it wouldbecome necessary to reach a decision wittin a month or so on the question of the inclusion or exclusion of Burma;   and if the Eurmans could not make thedecision themselves it would eventually become the-   - 10 -
duty of the British Government to make it, which, for various reasons, would he a most dangerous proceeding in the immediate future.    In the Secretary of State&apos;view the only course open appeared to be to wait for as long as we could afford to wait, and to use every endeavour to educate the members of the new Counciland the people of Burma in what direction their interests really lay.The Secretary of State for India reported thatthe new President of the Legislative Council inRangoon had been removed from Office on the ground thatsix amendmentshe had not acted impartially when ruling out/at theprevious day&apos;s meeting, when the question of the separation of Burma came up for discussion.     It wasimpossible for him to make any forecast as to whatwas going to happen in Burma,The Cabinet took note of the Secretary of StatefsMemorandum and statement.
6.     The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumby the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries ^ thePresident of the Board of Trade, the Home secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP .-429 (32) )on the Lane-Fox Bacon Report and Long-Term Agricul-tural Policy.   The conclusions to which the cabinet was asked to assent may be summed up as follows:-(a) The regulation of imports as an integral part of the Government&apos;s agricultural policy is justified  (i) where it appears to be essential for the effective working of ascheme for re-organising a branchof the agricultural industry(as in the case of bacon);    and(ii) where it is necessary to avertan economic crisis (as at thepresent moment in the case of meat) (Para.5).(b) It is necessary to take correspondingI Para .6) ,(e) The precise form which this power should take in the case of NorthernIreland will require further consider-ation (Para.6) .(d) Legislation on.these lines should include a provision for the appoint-ment of a Standing Committee to watchover the working of supply regulation,to help in the elaboration of a continuous policy, and to adviseMinisters as to the best method, ofcarrying it out.   (para.7).(e) Provisional approval should be givento a Bill attached to the Memorandum(Appendix &quot;A&quot;) so that parliamentary counsel may proceed with the prepara-tion of a draft Bill on these linesfor submission to the Home AffairsCommittee.   (Para.8).(f) The Minister of Agriculture andFisheries should be authorised tomake at an early date an announcement that the Government accept therecommendations of the Lane-FoxCommission in principle; i.e.   thatthey are prepared to take whateversteps are necessary to establish are-organised bacon industry on a firmfooting, to provide for its expansionhome output
within reasonable limits, and toregulate imports, by arrangementor otherwise, so far as may berequisite for the purpose. (Para.9).The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries informed the Cabinet that his memorandum (CP. 429(32)) hadbeen initialled by the colleagues mentioned at the headof this Minute for purposes of circulation and not asexpressing concurrence in all his proposals.The President of the Board of Trade agreed in this and expressed some doubts as to the wisdom of supersed-ing the automatic regulation of markets by regulationssavouring of State socialism.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed: -(a) Without committing the Cabinet at allon the question of principle, that theMinister of Agriculture should beauthorised to prepare a Bill on thelines of the draft heads attached tohis memorandum (CP. 429(32))ithat is to say, making provision forthe importation not of particular agricultural products but ad omnia.    The cabinet after seeing the Bill could then decide whether the provision should be ad omniaor for specific commodities:(b) That the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries should be authorised to makeat an early date an announcement thatthe Government accept the recommendationsof the Lane-Fox Commission in principle;i.e. that they are prepared to takewhatever steps are necessary to establish a re-organised bacon industry on a firmfooting, to provide for its expansionwithin reasonable limits, and to regulateimports, by arrangement or otherwise, sofar as may be requisite for the purpose.
