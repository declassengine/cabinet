From these telegrams it appeared that the Government of Indi       d found themselves,for political reasons,  obliged to allow the ottawa agreements to be sent to a Committee, with instruc-tions to report by the 21st November.   They consideredthat their acceptance of this Committee improved the chances of the ultimate passage of the Bill, though they could not as yet express any definite opinon as to whether the Assembly would accept it.The Secretary of State for India reported to theCabinet that he had done his utmost to urge on theGovernment of India the great importance of proceeding as rapidly as possible with the Ottawa Agreements.The Cabinet, while regretting the delay, was unable to suggest any means of expediting the procedure.

THE DISARMAMENTCONFERENCE.Prohibition on(the Use ofl^emicalWarfare,(previous reference:Cabinet 2(32), Con-clusion 2(i)(c) .)FR10. ^he Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Foreign Office (CP.-395 (32)) on the subject ofthe Prohibition on the Use of Chemical Warfare.   TheMemorandum stated that the Bureau of the DisarmamentConference was at present discussing methods of applying the prohibition, and that a decision was urgently required on two points on which the UnitedKingdom Delegate had been compelled to put in reserva-tions against the view taken by the other members ofthe Bureau, viz. (l) Retaliation, and (2) Sanctions.On the question of Retaliation, three courses appearedto be open to His Majesty&apos;s Government(a) To fall in with the view of the othermembers of the Bureau and agree to prohibit retaliation.(b) To state that we hold that, whilerigorously maintaining the prohibi-tion against chemical warfare, we areunable to undertake that we should notin the last resort be compelled tohave recourse to it if it were usedagains t us ,(c) To say that we could only agree to a prohibition on retaliation if we were satisfied (i) that such measures of supervision could be imposed 3Swould prevent preparations enablingchemical warfare to be used against uson any considerable scale;    and (ii)that a violation of the prohibitionwould call down on the head of the offender such effective sanctions onthe part of other States that retaliationon the part of the victim would besuperfluous.On the question of Sanctions the Memorandum statedthat it would be very difficult for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to make out any case for refusing to considerthe principle of sanctions for violations of theprohibition on chemical warfare, and that the textbefore the Bureau was more acceptable to us than mighthave been expected or than was likely to emerge from,any new discussion of the matter at Geneva.
The discussion at the Cabinet may be summed upas follows ;The proposals forwarded from Geneva provide a,typical example of the unreality of much of theproceedings at the Disarmament Conference.    It isinconceivable that the Governments represented atthe Disarmament Conference can possibly intend toallow their nationals, whether soldiers or civilians,to be gassed by an enemy and in no circumstances to resort to retaliation.   Neither is it conceivable that they would entrust the safety of their nationalsto vague and uncertain sanctions.   As usual, however,other Delegations have shirked the true issues, andhave left it to the representatives of this countryto state the realities and to incur the odium ofrejecting impracticable proposals .Poison gas, the Cabinet were informed, is a by-prodtict of certain articles of commercial manufacture,and it would be impossible to devise such measures of supervision &quot;as would prevent preparations enablingchemical warfare to be used against us on any consider-able scale&quot; .It was suggested that the nations concerned mightbe asked openly to state whether they proposed to suppress gas-masks and all the elaborate measures thatthey are taking, with the widest publicity, to protect their respective civil populations against the use of gas .The Cabinet were reminded of the.first use of gasin the late War, when public opinion had compelled theGovernment to retaliate, and it was urged that incorresponding circumstances in a future war publicopinion would never allow our enemy to use gas withoutat least a defensive use^pw part.
The Cabinet were reminded also that the dominions were believed to hold strong views on this subject and that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsmight easily secure their support to any action he might deem advisable.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairspromised full co-operation in this respect.The Prime Minister reminded the Cabinet that therewas another side to the question.    If retaliation was admitted, there would be no disarmament in poison gas.He did not think, however, that it was a question ofa &quot;Yea&quot; or &quot;Nay&quot; answer.   He thought the Cabinet oughtto make quite clear that they would not agree to a simpleattitude -Po^ or apainst retaliation.At the same time it was desirable that the United Kingdom delegation should not find itself in a minority of one.   Theyshould press other Delegations as to whether in factthey were prepared never to retaliate.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be informed of the viewof the Cabinet that we could not possiblyagree to forgo in all circumstances theuse of the right of retaliation if poisongas was used against us.   The late war had shown that if poison gas were used against our nationals, public opinion would never tolerate our abstention fromthe use of this weapon.   Neither could we entrust the lives of our people tothe vague and uncertain sanctionscontemplated at Geneva,    This was not because we had the smallest intentionourselves of resorting to chemical warfare, but because the use of poisongas against the enemy was the only formof effective retaliation that could bedevis ed:(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be advised to call ameeting of the representatives of theBritish Commonwealth of Nations atGeneva with a view to securing a commonattitude on their part and their support to any statement he might make on thesubject:
(NOTE:    Owing to the absence of most of the representa-tives of the Dominionsfrom Geneva, it may benecessary, instead, to consult them by telegram.)(c) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be asked to do all inhis power to avoid the United kingdom or the British Commonwealth of Nationsbeing placed in a minority of one.While full discretion was left to him as to how he should secure this object,the suggestion was made that he shouldtest the bona fides of other States bypressing them (whether in public or private,  or both) as to whether theycould really guarantee that in no circumstances would they resort topoison gas as a measure of retaliation,and as to whether, on the adoption ofthis Convention, they intended to relinquish their measures of protection against poison gas.
reduction and limitation of armaments .British State-ment of Policy(previous reference:Cabinet 60132), C on-conclusion 1.)11.   The Prime Minister informed the Gabinetthat he had just received a message from the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, at Geneva, stating thathe had arranged to speak on Thursday, November 17th,at 10.30 a.m., when he would read the Statementapproved by the Cabinet at the Meeting referred toin the margin, and that the Statement would be released at 11 a.m, London time on the same day.The reasons for postponement were:-(l) The publication of the French Plan,which was the sole topic at the moment:(2) The inability of M. Paul Soneour to beat Geneva before Thursday:(3) The need for time for the various governments to consider whether theywill not express their approval ofour point of view.
meat POLICY.(previous reference:Cabinet 60(32), Con-elusion 13.)12.    The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,  .in reply to a request, informed the Cabinet that he proposed to circulate every week information showingthe effect of the .recent arrangements on wholesalewfeeaA prices ,2, Whitehall Gardens, s.W.1November 16, 1932.
Draft of the King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.November 22, 1932.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,MY relations with foreign Powers continue to be friendly.In accordance with the conclusions reached by the Conference at Lausanne,a World Economic Conference is to be convened by the League of Nations andwill be held in London as soon as possible next year. It is My earnest hope thatthe Conference will be able to reach agreement on the measures required to dealwith the causes which have brought about the present economic and financial difficulties of the world.The Conference for the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments now sittingat Geneva embodies the hope and the effort of mankind to reach the greatestmeasure of general disarmament that can be attained. My Government willcontinue, in full co-operation with all the other members of the Conference, towork for an international convention which will be a foundation for a lasting peace.My Ministers and other members of both your Houses are meeting in conference representatives of the Indian States and of British India. They hopethereafter to place before you proposals for further constitutional development in India and Burma. The decisions to be taken will be of great moment to thewhole of My Empire, and I shall watch your deliberations with deep interest.Members of the House of Commons,The Estimates for the Public Service will be laid before you in due course.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,Although the various conversion schemes which have been successfully carried through offer the prospect of large reductions in the service of the National Debt,it is still necessary to exercise careful supervision over public expenditure, both national and local.The measures already taken to assist British industry in the home market and to improve our markets overseas have created a feeling of greater confidence.My Government will continue to do everything in their power to stimulate the recovery of trade.Agriculture has long been depressed by the general fall in the wholesale prices of its products. My Ministers recognise that though the measures recently taken in regard to meat and other products have been of real assistance to producers, further plans are necessary to enable agriculture as a whole to take its proper place in the economy of the nation. While the restoration of prosperityto agriculture cannot be expected until wholesale prices have risen to a more normal level, My Government believe that the various steps which they havetaken, combined with action upon the investigations concluded, or still proceeding,will enable the industry to put itself in a position to take full advantage of a return to more favourable conditions.The persistence of the situation in which large numbers of My people arestill unable to find employment causes Me the greatest anxiety. Unemploymentas we have known it for some years is undoubtedly the gravest of our social problems. In particular I am distressed that many young men and womenhave never in their lives had an opportunity of regular employment.[7860]

In the view of My Ministers any provision for unemployed persons shouldnot only afford material assistance but should also be designed to maintain their jkmorale and their fitness to resume work when opportunities can be found.   My tU-Government intend to bring forward Measures dealing comprehensively with:Unemployment Insurance and Avith the treatment of those unable to obtain rwork, and the considerations I have mentioned will be borne in mind in framing Jtheir proposals.Bills relating to Scotland will be introduced to amend the proceduregoverning private legislation, to facilitate the administration of civil justice, andfor other purposes.Measures dealing with Rent Restriction, London Passenger Transport andother matters of importance will be introduced and proceeded with as time and opportunity offer.I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your labours.
