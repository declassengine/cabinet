PROPOSEDMEMORIALrpO THE LATE^ LORD oxford and ASQUITP,(previous reference:Cabinet 55(32), Con-elusion 1.)1. The Prime Minister said that he had toreport to the Cabinet that the late Lord oxford and Asguith&apos;s family had received with gratitudeand pride the decision of the Cabinet to put up atablet to the former Prime Minister in westminster abbey and had accepted the offer.   They had asked the Prime Minister, on behalf of the Cabinet, tounveil the tablet.The Cabinet agreed  That the Prime Minister should accept the above invitation.
SKY WRITING(previous reference:Cabinet 46(52), Con-clusion 9 ,)F.R.2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum, bythe Home Secretary (CP,-407 (32)) stating that,in accordance with the Conclusion of the Cabinetmentioned in the margin, a Conference had been heldon the subject of Sky Writing and Sky Shouting,between representatives of the Home Office andother Departments, and trade representatives, witha view to the establishment of a voluntary bodyof control to carry out the recommendations of theSelect Committee and the requirements of theGovernment Departments.   As a result of this Confer-ence the representatives of the various commercialorganisations had expressed their willingness toco-operate in establishing such a body, which wouldbe a consultative Committee and would formulategeneral rules with which sky-writing operators wouldbe expected to comply.   The experience of the workingof this voluntary system would provide usefulknowledge of the practical difficulties for which provision might have to be made by legislation ifthis should ultimately prove necessary.The Prime Minister reminded the Cabinet that atthe Meeting referred to in the margin, when approving the proposal of the Home Secretary for the summoning of a Conference, they had to a certain extent reservedtheir position on the question of principle by thefollowing Conclusion:-&quot;(iii) That the Report of the conference should be laid before the cabinet before a decision is taken forthe preparation of a Bill.&quot;On reading the last paragraph of the Home Secretary^Memorandum he felt that if the proposals now beforethe Cabinet were agreed to, they might be held to becommitting themselves to the whole principle of sky-writing.
Another view was that the present proposal was really only for an experiment and that it would still be possible, as the result, to introduce aBill to prohibit sky-writing.In the circumstances, the Cabinet agreed -To keep the subject on the agenda paper until the Home Secretarycould be present.
rSIA. 3.     The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsCJq&apos;qX to the       informed the Cabinet that there was one question of:rdo-PersianjFcompany. foreign policy which he must bring up as one of urgency.previous The Persian Government on the personal initiative, itreferenceCabinet 62(32), was believed, of the Shah had cancelled the concessionConclusion ll).of the Persian Oil Company.     He had now informationathat the Police were removing or obliterating theCompany&apos;s sign-boards in Persia.     At first Sir JohnCadman, the Chairman of the Persian Oil Company, hadwanted the question left to the Company to deal with.How that other action had been taken this appeareddifficult.     The Secretary of State, therefore, proposedto send the strongest possible message to our minister in Tehran.     He thought also that the Cabinet ought toconsider what protection could be offered to the OilFields in the last resort.The Cabinet were reminded that,at the meeting referred to in the margin, some discussion had takenplace on the plans of the Committee of Imperial defence for the protection of the Persian Oil fields.    Thesuggestion was made that the Chiefs of Staff Committeeshould be invited to consider the present situation andreport.     A suggestion was made that if protection ofthe Persian Oil Company1s property and pipe-lines was difficult, there might be Persian assets that were within our reach, e.g., the hew Fleet, ports such as Bushireand the establishment at Henjam.The Cabinet were reminded that many Persian subjectsderived an income from the wells and were interested in maintaining the Company&apos;s position, and it was suggestedthat the Chiefs of Staff Committee should not ovelook the position of the Bakhtiari.
Another suggestion was that It might be useful to movemen-of-war within the Persian Gulf in order to impress on the Persian Government how seriously we regarded theposition.     This was left to the Chiefs of Staff Committeeto consider.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs consulted the Cabinet as to whether in his Note he should mention the possibility of referring the question to the PermanentCourt of International Justice.      He himself inclined tothe use of some more general language.     This latter viewcommended itself to the Cabinet, and one suggestion wasthat he should use some term such as &quot;all measures In our power&quot;.The Cabinet agreed: -(a) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should at once make a very strong protest to the Persian Government against their cancellation of the concession to theAnglo-Persian Oil Company, and the removalor obliterating of the Company&apos;s sign-boards.(b) That in his Note he should not mention the possibility of referring the question tothe Permanent Court of international Justice.(c) That the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee shouldbe invited at once to consider and report onthe question of how far it was possible toprovide in the last resort for the protectionof the Anglo-Persian Oil Company&apos;s property,Including the pipe-lines, by military means;that is to say, whether by local and direct action or by retaliation elsewhere or by both.(d) That in the event of the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee recommending the movement ofmen-of-war in the Persian Gulf or any other action of that kind to Impress the Persianswith the seriousness of the situation, theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs shouldhave authority to sanction it if he deemed itwise and appropriate without reference to theCabinet.
ANCBURIA,e LyttonReport.(previous reference:1 Cabinet 62I (32), Con-* elusion 4.)F.R.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that before leaving for Geneva he felt that he ought to warn the Cabinet that the question ofManchuria was likely to reach an important stagenext Tuesday, when it would come before the Assemblyof the League.    He proposed to do his utmost to avoidhaving to take a lead.    He thought it was probablethat the first eight Chapters of the Lytton Report,dealing with questions of history and fact, would be approved by the Assembly,   He could see no other course.    It was possible that the Assembly might wish to go further, and either to adopt some actionthemselves or to   pass a Resolution that would be unacceptable to Japan.   He had noticed that theLytton Commission did not recommend the League to do anything in particular.   Most of their recommendations were addressed to China or Japan.   He thought thathe might be able to make some use   of this point.If a Resolution was moved that Manchuria must notbe recognised, he would do his best to oppose theproposal.    In this connection it had to be rememberedthat recognition was not given for the benefit of aState so much as for the convenience of the people who were giving the recognition.   He was already being pressed by commercial people to recognise, andit would certainly be most inconvenient if, in akidnapping case, for example, comparable to that ofMrs Pawley, we were unable to obtain any assistance for British subjects owing to our failure to recognise.He proposed, therefore, to be careful not to commit the Government never to recognise Manchukuo.
The Prime Minister agreed that the act of recogni-tion belonged to the sovereignty of States,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thenreported that one proposal,that had come from an authoritative quarter in the League of Nations, wasthat the last part of the Lytton Report should bereferred to the United States of America, the Unionof Soviets and the signatories of the Nine-PowerTreaty,   He thought it probable, however, that someof the smaller Powers- would be reluctant to allow the question to pass out of the hands of the League.The Cabinet approved the general line proposed by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs.
reduction and limitation of armaments .The DisarmamentConference.Prime Minis-ter&apos;s proposed visit to geneva.(previous previous reference:Cabinet 62(32), Con-clusion 16 .)F.R.5. The Prime Minister discussed briefly withthe Cabinet his proposed forthcoming visit to geneva, and its objects.    He thought it desirableto avoid taking any part in the Meeting of theAssembly on the Manchuria question.   He had arranged, however, to meet M. Herriot and Baron vonNeurath, and he hoped also to see Mr Norman Davis,the American representative.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported also that Italian representatives would beat Geneva, and his proposal that Italy should berepresented in the forthcoming discussions with theobject of bringing Germany back to the DisarmamentConference had been warmly welcomed by Italy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out thatthe position of the Debt negotiations and theshortness of the time available rendered it somewhatdubious as to whether it was advisable for the PrimeMinister to be absent for more than a day    or two.The telephone did not provide a sufficiently secretmeans of communication.The Cabinet felt that the Prime Minister*s negotiations at Geneva might prove so important thatit would be Inadvisable for him to cancel hisarrangements, unless it transpired that some of theother principals were unable to attend.    If the Debtnegotiations should again reach a critical stageit might be necessary for the Prime Minister toreturn at. short notice.The Prime Minister accepted this view, and invited the Secretary of State for Boreign affairs to ascertain at once whether M. Herriot was likely
to be able to come to Geneva, as the latest news from our representatives at Geneva tended to showthat he would not be able to leave Paris.
mPE DISARMAMENT     6.      The Cabinet had before them the Report of anSperence .u      __ Inter-Departmental Conference on the subject ofinhibition . ,    , % ^on the Use of       Chemical Warfare (CP.-408 (32)), under the Chairman-fiheiBicalWarfare, ship of the Secretary to the Cabinet, held onNovember 22, 19 32, the Conclusions of which were(previous reference: summed up at the end of the .Report as follows:-Cabinet 61(32), Con- (1)  In carrying out the policy of the Cabinetelusion 10,) the British representative on the bureau of the Disarmament Conference might consider the following methods, accord-ing as circumstances permit, for avoid-ing isolation:-(a) ^o adhere firmly to the policy hithertopursued by His Majesty&apos;s governments in the United Kingdom and the dominions of refusing to enter into definitecommitments for exercise of sanctions.This will probably compel the Frenchand other Delegations to refuse toabandon the right of retaliation.(b) To present the matter not as a statementof the British case, but as objectivelyas possible and as a matter affectingall nations, as-suggested in paragraph 12.(c) To emphasise the point that abolitionof the right of retaliation will not prevent of impede the production ofthose important forms of gas which,as shown by earlier internationalexpert investigation at Washington andGeneva, are produced in time of peacefor commercial purposes. If he thinksit likely to strengthen his case, theUnited Kingdom Delegate might ask thatthis aspect of the question be referredanew to inquiry by chemical experts.(2) Even if the United Kingdom representative is unable in the last resort to avoid isolationat the Bureau in carrying out the policy ofthe Cabinet, he can reasonably expect to havethe support of most, if not all, of theDominions, and perhaps of some other nations(including, possibly, Germany) in any largerassemblage at the Disarmament Conference..(3) Even if His !Va,jesty&apos;s Governments were willingto reverse their previous policy towardscommitments, sanctions are not likely, except possibly in cases of wars between two smallStates, to be sufficiently reliable or promptin operation to be depended on to prevent theuse of gas, for reasons given in paragraph 19.(4) On a hasty examination, the Conference cannot recommend the proposal for a time-limit withinwhich the League should endeavour to securedesistance from the use of poison gas by abelligerent, and during which resort should
not be made to retaliation.   The defence departments, however, should give furtherconsideration to the suggestion,: The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs paidtribute to the work of Mr. Eden on this question.He suggested, however, that when the critical stagewas reached it would be very desirable that theSecretary of State for War should be present at Genevaor the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State if he was unable to attend.     The Secretary of State for War saidthat he was always ready to go to Geneva if the stateof business at home permitted.The Cabinet accepted the report of the Inter-Departmental Conference on the subject of chemical warfare CP. 408(32).
&quot;7.       The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of Housing Policy:-The Report of the Cabinet Committeeappointed at the Meeting referred toin the margin (CP.-409 (32)), which contained, the following recommenda-tions:-(l) That as regards England and wales the Minister of Health should beauthor is ed:-(a) to negotiate with the EuildingSocieties and the Local Axithori-ties on the lines indicated inparagraph 1 (iii) of C.P.-386(32), on the understanding -(i) that in the proposed nego-tiations with the building societies the Ministry ofHealth should endeavour tosecure the most favourable terms as regards rates ofinterest and period of   .replacement for loans advanced by the Societies&apos; for thebuilding of working-classhouses:(ii) that any Exchequer guarantee should be conditional on therate of interest and periodof the loan being approvedby the Treasury.(b) To introduce legislation forterminating subsidy under theActs of 1924 and 19 31 and forauthorising arrangements on thelines indicated in paragraph 1(iii)  of C.P.-386 (32).(c) To proceed with the consilidation of subsidy under the Housing acts of 1919, 1923 and 1924.   .(S) That, with a view to the proposedHousing Bill receiving a SecondReading before the Christmas Recess,the Minister of Health should beauthorised to introduce the Billin the House of Commons early inDecember in the form approved bythe Committee of Home Affairs.(3) That as regards  Scotland, theSecretary of State for scotland should be authorised to proceed on the lines proposed by him (seeparagraph 4 of C.P.-409 (32)) subjectto agreement being reached with theChancellor of the Exchequer on theamount of the reduced subsidy tolocal authorities in Scotland under
the Act of 1924, during a periodof two years, and subject alsoto the application of (l)(a)(i)and (ii) above to the negotiations in Scotland with the building societies and Local Authorities.A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Scotland (C.P.-411 (32))    whichhad been before the Cabinet Committeewhen preparing the above Report,setting out fully Scotland&apos;s special housing problem and seeking authorityfor *-(a) negotiation with the building societies and the Local Authori-ties on lines indicated in para-graph 9 of his Memorandum;    and(b) introduction of legislation -(i) terminating subsidy under theActs of 1923 and 19 31;(ii) terminating subsidy under theAct of 1924 so far as payable to private builders, and reducing subsidy to Local, Authorities under that ActJ$7 to a sum of  4 ^ sfesisgog? inhI rural areas)   the reducedsubsidy to continue for aperiod of two years;    (theforegoing to be subject tothe understanding that, inpractice, the subsidy willbe made available only inrespect of houses erectedfor the abatement of over-crowding and for the accommo-dation of low wage earners);and(iii) facilitating the sale and theletting at a higher rent ofhouses erected under the act of 1919, if on further investi-gation such action is found tobe practicable.
The Prime Minister made observations to the following effect:-(i)    It was very desirable that the rent restriction Bill should be introduced before the Bill now contemplated, asthe latter was likely to be unpopular;(11) That It was Important for the Cabinetto be sure that private enterprise wouldbe in a position to provide houses on anadequate scale:(iii) That it Is most undesirable that the numberof houses per acre of land should beincreased on any considerable scale, e.g.,from twelve to twenty:(iv) That It was important to obtain the co-operation of the local Authorities as wellas of the Building Societies.The Minister of Health gave replies showing that allthese points were receiving careful consideration.In reply to a question the Minister of Healthexplained that one effect of the present proposals shouldbe to concentrate the building activities of LocalAuthorities and their special building organisations onslum areas for which the Chancellor of the Exchequer wasproviding funds.The Secretary of State for Scotland .reported thathe had agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer thatthe subsidies to the Local Authorities should be reducedto  3 instead of  4, as set forth in CP. 411(32),paragraph 20 (b)(.ii) (quoted above)j    the reduced subsidycontinuing for a period of two years.     He also drew atten-tion to the following passage In paragraph 4 of CP.409(32):(b) The introduction of legislation: -(iii) facilitating the sale and the lettingat a higher^rent of houees erectedunder the Act of 1919, if on   further investigation such action is found tobe practicable.
The Minister of Health said that this pointrequired co-ordinating with the English Bill, sincethe proposal in Its present form is not applicableto the latter.     He suggested that the matter be leftto the two Ministers who were doing their best to findaccommodation between their respective positions.The Cabinet agreed:-(a) To approve generally the proposals in CP. 409(32) and CP. 411(32),as summarised above:(b) To take note that twoBills, one for England and one forScotland, will be required.(c) To take note that in the case of scotland the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for Scotland had agreedto reduce the subsidy to Local authorities under the Act of 1924 from  4 to  3:(d) To take note that the Minister of health and the Secretary of State for scotland were considering further the point in scottish legislation,relating to the sale and letting at higher rent of houseserected under the Act of 1919, if on further investigation such action was found to be practicable.
EDUCATIONCONFERENCE.previous reference:Cabinet 62(32), Con-clusion 12.)8.     The Cabinet again had before them a Memo-randum by the President of the Board of Education(CP.-397 (32)) on the subject of an ImperialEducation Conference, consideration of which hadbeen postponed at the Meeting referred to in the margin.    In this Memorandum the President asked the approval of the Cabinet to his approaching the oversea Governments with a view to holding an imperial Education Conference in 1934.The Chancellor of the Exchequer raised thequestion as to whether   in the present financialposition it was necessary to deoide on a conference as soon as 1934.The Cabinet were informed that the proposal had been recommended by a Committee on which theDominions were represented by their respectiveHigh Commls sioners.The Cabinet were also informed that, from thepoint of view of the Colonies who were being pressed to reduce expenditure, it would be embarrassing ifthe Conference resulted in recommendations forfurther expenditure on education.      On the otherhand a good deal of emphasis was laid on theimportance of Imperial contacts of this kind.The Gabinet agreed.-To authorise the President of theBoard of Education to approach the oversea Governments with a view toholding an Imperial Education Conferencein 1954, but invited him in doing soto intimate that the invitation wasprovisional and might have to be postponed if financial conditions didnot Improve,

The Prime Minister suggested that theGovernment should adopt, not rigidly, but so faras might prove practicable, the following procedure in dealing with Private Members&apos; Bills:-(a) As a general rule, where practicable,    \Ministers should abstain &quot;from makingstatements of Government Policy on        /Private Members&apos; Bills:(b) That when Ministers did speak onbehalf of the Government on private members&apos; Bills they must be very careful not to promise facilities.The Dog Racing (Local Option) Bill was recognised as one of the cases where the Governmentprobably could not abstain from some announcement.The Cabinet agreed  That the Government spokesman shouldmake it clear that the Government didnot agree in all the details of theBill, but? if the House desired toproceed with the measure, would not oppose and would move some amendments in Committee.   He should make itclear, however, that the operationof the Bill could not be retrospective.The Cabinet agreed  That the Wheat Act (1932) amendment bill would probably be blocked bythe Dog Racing (Local Option) Bill,and that the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries should have authorityto take appropriate action with theParliamentary Secretary to the treasury to arrange this.

16. The Secretary of State tac India reminded theOabinet that on a previous occasion he had expressedanxiety as to the prospects of the Indian ottawa agreement.    Since then he had been doing his best to promote its prospects and had spoken on thesubject to nearly every Indian Member at the RoundTable discussions.   His apprehensions had been increased rather than otherwise when the SelectCommittee had asked for a second week to complete the examination of the Agreement.   Now, however, hewas glad to inform the Cabinet that the report was favourable.    It contemplated that the Agreement would at any rate last for three years, without necessarilycoming to an end even then.   Meanwhile a StandingCommittee of the Assembly would watch its operation.The adoption of a period of three years comparedwith the original intention of six months only, andwas a marked improvement.    A point which the Secretaryof State emphasised was that this favourable report was due to the intervention of the Minister of Commercein India, who was an Indian, and Mr Chfitty, anotherIndian representative.The Cabinet took note with satis-faction of the above statement.
