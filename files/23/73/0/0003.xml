igg BRITISHJfa TO THER-KD SPATESprevious:; Reference:Cabinet 61(32), Can-elusion 7.;F.R.This Meeting of the Cabinet was in effect a continuation of a meeting which had been held theprevious evening when members of the Cabinet, as itwere in Committee, had discussed the American note in reply to our request for suspension of the war debt payment due on December 15th.    The notes ofthis meeting are attached in the Appendix.The Cabinet had before them the text of theEritish Note presented on November 10th (CP .-389(32)),    In addition, the following had been circulated:-   the text of the American Reply(Cmd.4203) and a number of Secret Telegrams fromthe British Ambassador at Washington.Although no decision had been taken on theprevious evening, the trend of the discussion hadbeen in favour of payment being made to the UnitedStates on December 15th in gold if, as was antici-pated, Congress should refuse suspension.The Prime Minister reported that the result ofthis meeting was taking shape in a tentative draft note to Washington.    In addition, he himself, in company with the Lord President of the Council, theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, had that morning seenLord Tyrrell, who had arrived from Paris for thepurpose, and had discussed with him the actions andreactions of the French Government to this question.Early in the Meeting the Chancellor of theExchequer, after stating that he had prepared a brief summary of the Note mentioned by the Prime -Minister, reported a new development in the situationHe had just received information from an authoritative-tive source to the effect that both President Hooverand the American Secretary to the Treasury took
fil ltd&apos;  Jti-   %rather a different view of the situation from thatassumed by the Press here.    They considered thatwe had gained a major point in so much as boththe present and the coming President of the UnitedStates had agreed to a re-examination of the Debtsituation.   They had not, it was true, been able toagree to a suspension of the payment to be made onDecember 15th, as they did not think that congress would accept it.    They had, however, made a proposalfor payment into a blocked account, though they now recognised that this would not be acceptableon this side.    Further, they had not closed the doorto a counter proposal on our part.   They had nowcommunicated, through unofficial channels, asuggestion that we should ask the United StatesGovernment, so far as the principal of the Debt was concerned, to waive their rights for 90 .days&apos; notice and to allow us to suspend payment for two years-.So far as the interest was concerned, they suggestedthat we should offer serial Bonds payable at one,two or three years .    They believed that they mightbe able to get this accepted by Congress.   Thisproposal was believed to amount to the same as ourown request for a suspensionJ Admittedly there wasAa possibility that the successors to the present administration might take a different view, as noPresident could bind his successor.    The present administration believed, however, that their successors would take the same view as themselves.The difficulty of this arrangement was that in all probability the United States Administration couldnot give the same terms to their debtorson the Continent of Europe,     Consequentlyif we took advantage of this hint and made
the proposal in the knowledge that it wouldprobably be accepted, we could be accused byPrance and other Continental debtors with having made an arrangement behind their back which put themin an impossible position, notwithstanding thearrangements made at Lausanne for keeping in touchwith them on the question.   This would wreck the lausanne Agreement, to which the Chancellor of theExchequer attached the utmost importance, and make our fixture relations with the European powers concerned very difficult.   The Chancellor of theExchequer was inclined, in these circumstances,  to instruct His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington to approach the American Secretary to the Treasury andenquire whether a proposal based on the aboveunofficial suggestion would be acceptable.    If the answer was in the negative, then we should fall backon our original intention to intimate that if our request for suspension was refused we would makethe December payment in gold, and the position wouldbe as it was today.    If the answer was in the affirmative, we should make clear that we could not accept unless the proposal was also available to thedebtors on the Continent of Europe..    In this way we should avoid any grievance that otherwise thepresent Administration might have that they had mad3us a fair offer and that we had rejected it?    and ifthe offer were made available to Continental debtorswe should avoid dangerous reactions on future negotia-tions with America on the ground that we had rejectedthis overture ,The discussion showed that this proposal had brought a very awkward complication into the issuebefore the Cabinet.   Up to that point the only
questions before them had been whether to pay or notto pay, and as to the form that our Note should take.The new offer, however* raised immense difficulties.The offer in itself was generally recognised to be favourable to this country, and in all probabilitylittle, if at all, inferior to our own request fora simple suspension.   The real difficulties arose,however, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer had indicated, in connection with the European debtors.We were bound by the understanding reached at lausanne, not, it was true,  in making our decision,to accept their opinion, but to keep them in touchwith the negotiations with as much candour as possible.To notify them that we had received this hint and intended to act on it and to suggest that they should(though precise information was lacking)do the same, appeared hardly fair, since/it was not likely that the offer would be open to them.   Theywould be entitled to say that we had made terms behind their backs.   And if, in fact, the same terms were hotdefault or togxven to them, they would either have to/pay the december instalment  in which case they would notratify the Lausanne Agreement.On the other hand, if we were to refuse the American offer on the ground that it was not tobe extended to other European nations, the american administration would have a legitimate grievanceagainst us and future negotiations would be prejudiced.Moreover, there was little doubt that, sooner or later,the unofficial suggestion would leak out.   The UnitedStates Administration, particularly if accused in thePress of either country of having treated us withundue severity, would be bound, in their own defence,to let it be known that this unofficial suggestion

And if, in fact, the same terms were hotdefault or togiven to them, they would either have to/pay the december instalment - in which case they would notratify the Lausanne Agreement.On the other hand, if we were to refuse the American offer on the ground that it was not tobe extended to other European nations, the american administration would have a legitimate grievanceagainst us and future negotiations would be prejudiced.Moreover, there was little doubt that, sooner or later,the unofficial suggestion would leak out.   The UnitedStates Administration, particularly if accused in thePress of either country of having treated us withundue severity, would be bound, in their own defence,to let it be known that this unofficial suggestion
had been made.    It would be represented by hostilecritics that His Majesty&apos;s Government had refuseda favourable   suggestion in the interests of Prance,a country that is most unpopular at the present timein the United Kingdom.    The accusation would beuntrue, for the real reason would be that we werenot willing, in order to gain this advantage, to upset the Lausanne Agreement and to disarrange thewhole of our European policy for an indefinite period.It was recognised, however, that it would be difficultto bring the true reason home to the public.   Forthese reasons it was felt that it would be dangerous to add the proposal to the Note which was about tobe sent to Washington.At a late stage of the discussion the Chancellorof the Exchequer read to the Cabinet a full summaryof the draft Note which was in course of preparation.The greater part of the Note consisted of a fullanswer to the veiled request of the United states administration that we should put them in possessionof facts and arguments in favour of suspension of thepayment due on December 15th, which could be presented to Congress for favourable consideration.   The draftended by intimating that if Congress could not be induced to suspend the payment we should be preparedto make it, and in gold.After hearing the very powerful case set forth in the Note, the Cabinet felt that there was every reason in favour of presenting it at the earliestpossible moment and publishing It to the world.The only question at issue, therefore, was as towhether the Note should end as set forth above, orby the inclusion of a proposal based on the linesof the unofficial suggestion from the United States;-5-
or simply contain the reasoned statement of thegrounds of our request for suspension, without anyintimation that we would pay or any counter proposal.Various alternatives were considered, e.g,, that theBritish Ambassador in Washington should be authorisedto show the Note to the American Secretary of theTreasury and consult him as to whether the offer should be included or not:    or that at the time of presentation of the Note he should continue conversa-tions as to the unofficial suggestion, in the courseof which he should ascertain, first, whether theywere in fact prepared to separate the question ofthe principal of the Debt from the interest:,   and,later, as to whether the offer would be extended to continental debtors.    In fact, if the reactions were favourable, he might be able to explain the disaterous efect on the Lausanne Agreement and on the politicaland economic state of Europe which would result froma refusal to do so.Considerable discussion also took place as towhat communications we should make at the presenttime to the Governments of Prance and other Europeandebtors.    Should we content ourselves with informing them of the general tenor of the grounds on whichwe substantiated our request for suspension?    or should we let them know of the unofficial hint thatwe had received?    strong views were expressed that we ought not to have to lose this favourable opportunitysimply owing to French objections, since, whether we accepted the unofficial suggestion or not, france would in any event have to choose between default and payment, with all its consequences, if the unofficialoffer was not extended to her.In dealing with this matter the Cabinet had inmind that the difficulty over the December paymentmust be surmounted in such a way as to open up the
The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State for. Foreign Affairs should instruct. His Majesty&quot;s Ambassador in washington to present to theUnited States Government as soonas possible a Note replying to theimplied request contained in theAmerican Note of November 23rd,and setting forth the facts andarguments in support of our request for the suspension ofthe December payment.   The Noteshould not contain the intimation that if our request for suspensionwas not acceded to we would pay ingold, or any reference to the unofficial suggestion referredto above.   The Ambassador should intimate our desire that the Noteshould be published as soon aspossible after its presentation.(b) That His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador shouldbe instructed, when presenting the note, to broach the unofficialproposal and ascertain whetherit, or some modification of it,could be put forward with good prospects of acceptance by theUnited States Administration and congress,    If so, the ambassador should then seek to ascertain whether the unofficial suggestion would be available to other debtors,and should make clear that FT isMajesty&apos;s Government attach import-ance to this, since differentiationmight involve default by France,the upsetting of the LausanneAgreements., and widespread confusionin the political and economic stateof Europe and the world,.(c) That His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Parisshould, for the moment, content himself with stating to the French Governmentthe general lines on which we intendedto support our request for postponing the payment due on December 15th,and indicating that His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Washington was beinginstructed to ascertain whether theAmerican Administration was willingto enter into further discussion for postponing payment of the instalment.Having thus established contact withthe French Government on the question,further opportunities should be taken,possibly during the forthcoming,meetings at Geneva and/or possibly by action at Paris, to discuss the matterprospect of a negotiation which would settle finallythe whole question of War Debts and Tariffs, for whichthe coming United States Administration was believed to be by no means unfavourably disposed.
in farther detail.   If it had notbeen found possible to induce theAmerican Administration to extend the unofficial suggestion to continental debtors, or at least some offer that would enable themto postpone the payment due onDecember 15th, we should endeavour,in the course of the negotiations,to obtain the consent of the Frenchand other Governments - concerned toour own acceptance of the offer.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,November 29, 1932.

mHE BRITISHfeBT TO THEUNITED STATESOP AMERICA.(previous reference:Cabinet 61(32), Con-elusion 7.)THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had not thoughtit advisable to summon a formal Meeting of the Cabinet,but merely to have a talk with members of the Cabinet,so that it could be announced, if necessary, thatthe Prime Minister, the Lord President of the Counciland the Chancellor of the Exchequer had met some oftheir colleagues,The question of the American Debt was becoming more and more complicated.    It was becoming clear thatthere was little chance of our obtaining a remission of the payment due on December 15th.   One real diffi-culty was that at the moment there was no political authority in the United States.   Mr Hoover was stillPresident:   Mr Roosevelt was not even prospectivePresident, since the Electoral College had not yetmet .   He could not take an effective part in thisquestion unless and until he had nominated hisSecretary of State, his Secretary of the Treasury and minister of Justice.   He could hardly do this untilthe Whips had been appointed, and it would involvehim in the risk of all kinds of intrigues.   Consequent-ly at the moment he.had no authority in America.December 15th was the date that our payment was due,and Congress was to meet on December 5th.   He under-stood that notice for business had been given and thatthe first question was to suspend the enforcement of prohibition.   This meant two daysf debate.   Thencertain formalities, such as asking leave to suspend,and so forth, had to take place before/discussion on.Prohibition,   Congress was only to meet for eight days..Consequently it was very unlikely that they would beable to take action in favour of suspension of payments ,.
The position was that we had now made an applicationfor a suspension and had received a reply.   He, theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Lord President ofthe Council and the Foreign Secretary had been workingaway at the draft of a reply, and were still continuing.At this point, however, they wished to know whether,assuming that no compromise was possible and that congress would not or could not agree to remission,the Cabinet favoured payment on December 15th or not;or, to put it the other way, did they favour defaultor not?(The Chancellor of the.Exchequerentered at this point.)THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that thebest thing that could happen would be that the UnitedStates Government should agree to a suspension of the december instalment.   That would get us out of everydilemma.   He himself had clung obstinately to thishope and had still not entirely abandoned it, although he stood almost alone in this &quot;view.      He recalled that the American Note was not a refusal of our request:in fact it was virtually an acceptance of the principleof re-consideration of the Debts.   So far as theinstalment due on December 15th was concerned, it was of remissionnot a refusal/, but a statement that we had not givensufficient reasons to enable the President to put theproposal before Congress.   We should now give thosereasons.   He was not certain that any reasons couldinduce Congress to remit the instalment, the amount ofwhich was 95f million dollars, made up of SO million dollars principal and 65^ million dollars interest.Under the Debt Agreement we had the right to give 90days&apos; notice that we desired a postponement of theprincipal payment.   That notice had not been given;
but the Secretary of the Treasury had the right to release the SO million dollars of principal withouti going to Congress.   This, however, would not help verymuch on the question of principle.   As regards there mission of interest, the Secretary of the treasury had no powers, and the matter rested with Congress.The Chancellor believed that for internal reasons,such as the Budget deficit, remission was unlikely.The question was complicated by the position in regardto Prance and other Powers resulting from the lausanne conference.   We were not bound by any undertaking to france  and these other Powers, and were free to take our own course:   but,without forming a common front on reparations, we had agreed to consult Prance and other powers as far as possible.    It was important not toget into a position of antagonism to Prance, as thiswould react on the Disarmament Conference and the peace of Europe.   He did not know the French views for certain,though he hoped to hear them very soon:   but such information as he had indicated that if the FrenchGovernment were to make a payment on December 15ththey would be thrown out.   In America there was a very strong feeling against Prance,   We had repeatedly been assured that what was possible for us was impossiblefor France.   The position now was What we had to send a Note,   It need not necessarily contain particulars of whether we intended to pay or not, but before sending the Note the Government must themselves make up their minds as to what they meant to do,i        to Pay, There was no warrant for the statement made in thePress that we were unable to pay.   We could pay.   Thequestion was whether we should.   The main argument against paying was that, in view of the present situationin Europe and the world, it would be almost a crime-3-
to make this payment.   The Prime Minister and thecolleagues he had mentioned had discussed this matterand had come to the conclusion that on that narrowbasis our case would be rather thin.   It was truethat it was a difficult case to bring home to theAmerican public, or even to people on this side.    Ifwe said &quot;We can pay but we are not going to&quot; it wouldhave a serious reaction.   He had consulted theGovernor of the Bank.   Mr Norman had not hithertotaken a strong line in this question, as he probablyrecognised that it had important political aspects;but on that particular point he had expressed adefinite view that default on our part would befollowed by default by three countries that owed usmoney   Australia, Argentina and Germany.   On whatevergrounds we put our case, the Governor of the Bankthought that the result would be that these three countries wotild follow our lead and jump at a plausibleexcuse for doing so.     In addition, refusal to pay would cause a profound shock to a large section ofpublic opinion in this country.   They would say thatit was a black day when this country refused to pay.After prolonged consideration of the subject hehad at last come to the conclusion that we ought, ifAmerica refused to allow remission, to pay up onDecember 15th.   At the same time we ought to put theconsequences quite clearly.   Congress should bebrought to realise that we were not working purelyfor our own interests, and they might then begin toconsider how their own interests were affected.Another consideration was as to what would happennext June if we paid in December.   It was a possibility,of course, that the present situation would be repeated,but he himself believed that before then we shouldhave entered on discussions for a final settlement.-4-
Another point &quot;was that assuming payment onDecember 15th, we could not count on receivinganything from our debtors abroad, whether in foreigncountries or the Dominions.   The Chancellor rejectedat once the proposal for paying the money into a blocked account.   That would have the worst effect.Payment Ixi dollars would also have an injuriouseffect.   There remained two other methods of payment,namely, in gold or by buying up American securitiesand selling them on the American market,   Both ofthese would be objectionable to the United States,but one or other of them would have to be adopted.In reply to questions, the Chancellor of theExchequer said that expert views varied a good dealabout the effect of payment on Sterling.   One goodopinion considered that payment might result in animprovement in Sterling.    If Sterling fell it would bring down commodity prices ,    Otherwise it would haveno effect on prices .THE&apos; PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE felt that theGovernment ought not to feel bound up with thehabitual view of the business man towards such questions.   He himself, as a business man, felt that point of view very strongly, namely, that the disastrous consequences of default could not be exaggerated.   But the troubles from the alternative course were almost as grave.   For example, there wasthe effect on the Lausanne arrangements.   Both we ourselves and. other Powers had believed that it mightbe possible to bring all these Debt arrangements toan end.   Neither the Prime Minister nor the Chancellorof the Exchequer had ever said that the Lausannesettlement depended on our immediate release from theAmerican War Debt;   but neither had they said that
we would release our foreign debtors.   consequently it would be necessary to admit in the House of Commonsvery soon that we were paying ovr instalment withoutreceiving anything from abroad.    It was quite clearthat Prance was not going to pay anything, anyhow.   Theycould not collect reparations from Germany, so theywould not pay.   The resulting financial disturbancewould land us in great difficulties, and it would be extremely difficult to enter into any future arrange-ments .   So far as foreign Exchanges were concerned,his own view was that payment would have a depreciatingeffect.    It might be a valuable argument to use withthe Middle West that payment would reduce our purchasingpower and that she was injuring her best customer by insisting on payment.   The American Government could never ignore the feeling in the Middle West.   If wecould make clear what would be the effect of payment on our purchasing power of meat and wheat it mighthave a very considerable effect.    The only question was whether there was time to push this informationover.Turning to the effect on trade, the president said that last year we bought  104,000,000 of Americanimports and sold them  18,000,000 of our exports.The former included large quantities of cotton and tobacco, as well as wheat and meat.   We should haveto be very careful about tobacco, owing to its effecton the revenue.   On cotton, also, we should have to becautious, owing to our cotton industry; and this rawmaterial provided about half the imports from America.As regards wheat and meat, however, the position was much simpler, since it was possible to discriminate between Empire whe&amp;t and foreign wheat, and we coulddispense with American supplies without any seriousrise in price.
The President of the Board of Trade did notthink that payment of the December instalment would help us in June.    It would be awkward for Mr Rooseveltif Mr Hoover had been paid in December and he was notto be paid in June.   As regards the payment, no doubtit wotild be possible to pay it in gold, but it would reduce our reserve from  140,000,000 to from 110,000,000 to  115,000,000.    He would like to know from the Chancellor whether the lower figure was sufficient backing for London credit.   Some peopleclaimed that the presence of gold made no difference,but the same people probably thought that it waspossible to get on without a metallic basis at all.He would like to know the Treasury view.In his opinion, none of the compromises, such aspaying the principal but not the interest, or theinterest but not the principal, or payment into a blocked account --there was no lack of such expedients  was of any real value.   The only question was whether we should pay or not.    Instinct told him to pay, andreason, not.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat Ministers were discussing an assumption whichthey hoped would not happen but which probably would.He did not agree with the President of the Board ofTrade that the payment now would not help us in June.The reasons against a default on the December payment,from the point of view of the Foreign Office, were asfollows.   First, by a default our best friends inAmerica, those who appreciated and could present ourmoral case, would lose all possibility of being ableto secure concessions hereafter.   These people would say that the American attitude was due to a constitu-tional deadlock, and though they would be rather ashamed-7-
of the American attitude they would say we ought tohave made allowances .   They would say that our originalapplication for remission was a sham, because we had never intended to pay anyhow.   He would, of course,discount the favourite American argument that if wewould do something now we should obtain advantageslater on.   Nevertheless he thought that a payment ofthe December instalment would help us in June,Secondly, there was the effect on Anglo-american relations.   His advisers at the Foreign Office thoughtthat the most powerful restraint on the German attitude in Europe was good Anglo-American relations.   If thetwo countries were to quarrel it would remove one ofthe most effective restraints on Germany in Europe.A third point was as to how we were to conductourselves in matters of default towards such countries as Chile, Greece, Austria, Russia, if we had ourselvesstated that we     can        pay but we will not.   Therewas also the question of the Irish Free State.Fourthly, our position vis-a-vis France was in any event somewhat difficult.   &quot;Tie French were watching usclosely, and, while being economical of information,we had to treat them with sufficient candour.   The only thing that would be quite simple would be to tell themthat we would work as hard as they would for release from this payment, but that in the last   resort wecould not default.   He could not say with how muchrelief he had heard the opinion to which the Chancellorof the Exchequer had come.    So far as Lausanne was concerned the Foreign Secretary admitted that everyonehad proceeded on the general idea that the UnitedStates would give us release.   Even so, however, he wasnot clear why the Lausanne settlement should fall topieces because we had to pay, even if we made norequest to the allies and to Germany to pay.

First, by a default our best friends inAmerica, those who appreciated and could present ourmoral case, would lose all possibility of being ableto secure concessions hereafter.   These people would say that the American attitude was due to a constitu-tional deadlock, and though they would be rather ashamed
of the American attitude they would say we ought tohave made allowances .   They would say that our originalapplication for remission was a sham, because we had never intended to pay anyhow.   He would, of course,discount the favourite American argument that if wewould do something now we should obtain advantageslater on.   Nevertheless he thought that a payment ofthe December instalment would help us in June,Secondly, there was the effect on Anglo-american relations.   His advisers at the Foreign Office thoughtthat the most powerful restraint on the German attitude in Europe was good Anglo-American relations.    If thetwo countries were to quarrel it would remove one ofthe most effective restraints on Germany in Europe.A third point was as to how we were to conductourselves in matters of default towards such countries as Chile, Greece, Austria, Russia, if we had ourselvesstated that we     can        pay but we will not.   Therewas also the question of the Irish Free State.Fourthly, our position vis-a-vis France was in any event somewhat difficult.   The French were watching usclosely, and, while being economical of information,we had to treat them with sufficient candour.   The only thing that would be quite simple would be to tell themthat we would work as hard as they would for release from this payment, but that in the last   resort wecould not default.   He could not say with how muchrelief he had heard the opinion to which the Chancellorof the Exchequer had come.    So far as Lausanne was concerned the Foreign Secretary admitted that everyonehad proceeded on the general idea that the UnitedStates would give us release.   Even so, however, he wasnot clear why the Lausanne settlement should fall topieces because we had to pay, even if we made norequest to the allies and to Germany to pay.
THE PRIME MINISTER said that at Lausanne it hadbeen made clear that if we ourselves had to payAmerica our allies had to pay us.   He thought we ought to make a demand on them to do so.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs emphasised that while the mass of the people would not understand the details, the result of default wouldbe a tremendous propaganda to get rid of the national government.    In Australia the result would be thetriumph of Lang-ism.   The position was not quite thesame in Ireland, because we had offered to discuss with de Valera, but the moral would be drawn that they need not pay.    It would be impossible for the national government to survive if they did not pay.   He hopedthat in the Note that was now to be sent, no doubtwould be left of our intention to pay.   Nothing couldbe worse than to get another rebuff from America andthen t o pay ,THE MINISTER OF HEALTH, agreed that payment shouldbe made, for reasons already given.   He emphasised the importance of payment not only from the point ofview of the sanctity of public debts but also of privatedebts.   Everywhere people were struggling to meet their obligations.    The effect of a conspicuous default bythe British Government would be very serious on these people.    It vrould affect the whole standard of probityin debts.    It was of vital importance today to restore the confidence of investors, and default would have aserious effect thereon.   He thought that the effect onthe Exchange position was probably pretty well discount-ed*    It had been said widely that we were unable to pay.A statement that we could pay might have rather a toniceffect.    In America there appeared to be an impression-9-
that this question had been rather sprung on them.That impression would be removed before June, and theywould not have the same excuse for insistence on payment.   He hoped that payment would be made in sucha manner as rather to give the impression of a lastdespairing effort in order to effect payment .    Inreply to a question as to how this should be done,, theMinister of Health suggested that it was a matter forthe Drafting Committee,THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR THE COLONIES thoughtthat it was far more than a drafting question.   Heshared the view of the President of the Board of Trade.If we paid in December we should be doing a thing thatwe could not repeat,    If the payment was made in goldit might be made to appear in that light.   If payment was made in investments he did not think the result would be the same.   He would do all possible to makeit appear that it was a payment that could only beeffected once.   He asked Ministers not to forget thatwe had always drawn a strong distinction betweenWar Debts and other debts.    It would be very dangerous to treat them as though they were on the same footing as ordinary debts ,   If we paid in December we certainlyought to make a strong claim on several countries topay us, especially Prance, who was in a better position than we were, and able to pay.   Unless it was made plain that this was a last payment the whole question would arise again in June... He did not think thecountry would stand further payments .   That was one reason why he insisted so strongly in representing itas a last payment.   To do so might also have a good effect on the Exchange, although if it appeared thatit was going to be continued it would have a disaterous efect ,
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSobserved that it must not be assumed that france would not in any circumstances pay.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was a great satisfaction to find that every point that had beenbrought up at that Meeting had been considered by thegroup of Ministers who had been working on the subject.. He now felt able to see clearly how the Note couldbe drafted so as to make clear that a payment on the15th December was contrary to the economic advantageof the world;    that we only paid because the payment was due; that,before any further payment coulddebtbe made,/negotiations must be opened up.   When Junecame and negotiations were in progress it would bemuch harder for the other side to insist on payment;for by agreeing to negotiations they would have admitted that the question was an open one.   Consequently the note could now be drafted, showing why we thought that payment on December 15th should not be pressed for,but admitting that if the proposal were rejected we intended to pay.    It was probable that the reasonfor refusing a suspensiongiven/would not be couched in a disagreeable formbut would be apologetic in tone, showing that rtheUnited States were acting/   under the pressure of constitutional necessity,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES did not feel satisfied that the Prime Minister&apos;s summing-upmet his point that it ought to be made quite clearthat this payment was a last effort,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA pointed out thatif we said we would pay now but never again, noPresident would enter into discussions with us.THE PRIME MINISTER said he did not think there was any real difference of opinion between the Secretaryof State for the Colonies and himself.   It was purelya matter of drafting,  Ke did not contemplate a secondpayment. -11-
THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER, in reply to thePresident of the Board of Trade, said he did not anticipate that a Supplementary Budget -would benecessary if the December payment were made.   He would keep the Secretary of State for the Colonies&apos; pointin mind, tut it would not be possible to say in so many words that this was the last payment.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES agreed,but hoped, nevertheless, that the point would be made.For his part he did not feel that he could remain amember of a Government that intended, to continuepaying except under the provisions of the Balfour Note.THE Secretary Of STATE FOR WAR said that if thedecision had rested with him he would have refusedpayment.   There was no doiibt that this December payment would injure us and that we could not go on making these payments indefinitely.    If we refused to pay inJune we should be defaulting just as much as today.He was certain the Americans were not going to let usoff in June,   He was confident that Congressmen werenot going to remit the Debt and would assume that thiscountry would continue paying.   He was confident thatthe country could not do so unless we were obtainingsomething from our debtors.    If we were to pay he hopedthat the payment would be made in gold and that weshould press all our debtors strongly, in order to showthat we were not going to pay the whole cost of the War.It would be fatal, in his judgment, not to press ourdebtors .THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that thesituation was extraordinarily difficult.   He felt agood deal of sympathy with the point of view of thePresident of the Board of Trade and the Secretary ofState for the Colonies.   He thought it was necessary-12-
to point out with the utmost clarity the effect thatthis drain on our resources was going to have on theAmerican export trade.    A young friend of his from theCity had made a suggestion that in dealing with Americansit was important to show a &quot;graph&quot;.   This seemed to him a good idea, and he thought a graph should be attachedto the Note to show the relation between payments andthe effect on American exports and world trade.   he agreed with most of the arguments he had heard on either side, but one transcended all others, namely,that the payment on December 15th did not mean aperpetuation of payments.   Whatever name we gave to a refusal to pay, in fact it would amount to repudiation.That was an ugly word.   He thought repudiation might bring the world within sight of the end of Capitalism.Our word was unique in the world.   If we broke it weshould give an example to the Argentine, Germany,Australia;    and the effect on public and private debtsthroughout the world would be very serious.   Moreover,it would be a tremendous shock to the vast majority ofthe working classes of this country if they realised that we were able to pay and did not pay.   He couldnot see that by paying now we prejudiced the situationin June.   When a new President was in office we shouldhave to have a negotiation.   That would provide anopportunity for the Government to state the whole case as to the effect of these debts.   If America would not give us a proper settlement a very serious situation would arise;   but there was no need to face that today.He hoped that with a new Administration in office itwould be possible to obtain something substantial.Whatever we did, the situation would be very difficult.If we paid there would probably be a good deal ofobjection in a section of the British Press, and that-13-
would be reflected in America.    If we did not pay,the American Press would represent us as thimble-riggers and bilkers.    By instinct and reason he sup-ported the line taken by the Chancellor of theEx che quer .THE PRIME MINISTER said that a point had nowbeen reached where the Ministers who had been devotingthemselves to this  question could complete a draft note, which would deal with the main points of substance raised in the discussion,   &quot;&quot;hat Note wouldbe submitted to a formal Meeting of the Cabinet.As he himself had to leave London for Geneva onThursday, it was important that the terms of the Noteshould be settled as soon as possible.   He therefore asked members of the Cabinet to hold themselves in readiness for a Meeting on the following day, muesday,November 29th.*       C       f1 Whitehall Gardens . s.w.1lovember 38. 1932.
