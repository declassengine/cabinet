REDUCTION AND 1. The Prime Minister explained that the reasonLIMITATION of armaments. for summoning the Cabinet had been to consider the,the  Disarmament latest developments on the War Debt payment to theConference.United States of America due on December 15th, but(previous reference e:Cabinet 64(32). Con-elusion 5.)as the Chancellor of the Exchequer had been delayedin his return from Birmingham by fog, he would takethe opportunity to give the Cabinet some account ofhis recent proceedings at Geneva. He recalled thathe had gone to Geneva for one purpose only, namely,to bring the Germans back to the Disarmament Confer-ence. His object had not been negotiations on disarmament. His main difficulties had arisen fromthe attitude of the American and French Delegations.Turning to his general impressions of the position at Geneva, he said that the United Kingdom was veryweak there.   This arose from the fact that some other nations had permanent Delegates there who did a lot of work when nothing particular was happening in thewasDisarmament Conference.   The result/that Memorandawere circulated and agreement reached informally, andwhen the United Kingdom Ministers arrived they founda great deal had been settled behind their backs .He gave examples of foreign representation, including mr. Wilson, the American representative; Mr Paul-Boncour,the French representative&apos; and Dr. B;enes .   As a resultof the recent Conference, however, the United Kingdomagain had the lead.    One great feature of the recentmeetings was that, owing to the small numbers engaged,it had been possible to have a series of very straighttalks between the representatives of the principalPowers.    He showed by illustration how frank hisinterchanges had been, both with the German and FrenchDelegates, and with others.   The Prime Minister said
that he had been on the verge of securing agreement on the afternoon of his first day in Geneva.   Atthat moment, however, the American representative had intervened in an unfortunate manner which hadseriously delayed matters.   The Prime Minister alsoemphasised that he and the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs had been very careful to keepthemselves within the limits laid down by cabinet decisions.   At the end of the meetings, aftereverything had been agreed, Mr Arthur Henderson, as president of the Disarmament Conference, had been invited to join those who had taken part in the conversations, to receive the results.    It was proposed that as the Disarmament Conference proceeded with its work, those who had taken part in the conversations should keep in touch, and thatMr Henderson should be invited to attend, their meetings in order to represent the DisarmamentConference and thus to avoid the suggestion that thework was being done outside the Conference.The Cabinet recognised that the agreement reached,at Geneva, which had been published in the Press onthe previous morning, was in conformity with their previous decisions .Reference was made to the latest Japanese NavalPlan, which the Prime Minister said he had had no opportunity to study.    He commented, however, thatthe Japanese were bound by the London Naval Treatyuntil 1936, and that their new proposals need not beconsidered until 1935.Some discussion took place as to whether it wouldnot be desirable to appoint a United Kingdom Delegatewho could remain permanently at Geneva.
The Prime Minister said that for the present theForeign Secretary was remaining in Geneva, but thathe would consult him on the subject on his return.-3-
TEE british war DEBT TOTHE UNITEDSTATES of America.(previous reference:Cabinet 65(33), Con-clusion 1 &amp;Appendix.)2, The Cabinet had before them the record of an anglo-French Meeting held in Paris on Thursday,December 8, 1932 (CP .-425 (32)),The Chancellor of the Exchequer read to theCabinet the text of a Note that had been despatched to the United States of America the previous evening(Appendix) and explained the circumstances in whichit had been sent to Washington and subsequently to paris for the information of M. Herriot, afterconsultation with the Prime Minister (who had beenindisposed) and the Lord President of the Council.The Cabinet accepted responsibilityfor the action that had been taken, and approved the Note.(A full record of this discussion is avail-able on the Secretary&apos;s standard file ofCabinet Minutes.)Afterwards the Chancellor of the Exchequer gave the Cabinet certain particulars as to the methods of payment of the instalment of the Debt due on December,15th;    the Budget arrangements;    the effect of goldwithdrawal on the Fiduciary Issue;    the position ofthe War Debts owing to the United Kingdom;    the depositof securities in the Bank to take the place of goldwithdrawn;    and the cost of the despatch of the gold to Washington.A short discussion followed on the arrangementsfor the Parliamentary Debate on the following day.(Details of the above are also on recordin the Secretary&apos;s standard file.)2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,December 13, 1932.
FULL SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION AT THECABINET ON DECEMBEFTlS, IS^STrC^KNW^d^n&quot;B^l^^fQ^C^U^W 2.)2.     The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed theCabinet that he had only just returned from a politicalengagement at Birmingham on the previous afternoonwhich he had made some time before.     During his absenceseveral events had occurred in connection with thequestion of the American War Debt.     First of all, theAmerican reply of December 11th (Cmd.4216 - Appendix I)to our second Note of even date (Cmd. 4215 - Appendix II)had produced an unfortunate reaction in France.     Up tothat moment M. Herriot had benefited from the visitpaid him by the Prime Minister and himself, and hisprospects of maintaining his position in the Chamberhad appeared reasonably satisfactory.     The effect ofthe American Note, however, had been to strengthen theopposition in the French Chamber.     M. Herriot had grownmore and more nervous, and, instead of inviting theChamber to vote on the previous day, had arranged an adjournment in order that he might discuss the question at a joint meeting of the Finance and Foreign AffairsCommissions.     M. Herriot had been under the impression that the United kingdom&apos;s reply to the American Note ofDecember 11th would reach him on the evening of Monday,December 12th, but the Chancellor was not aware of anyfoundation for such a supposition.     Late on the previous evening (December 12th) a telephone message had beenreceived from Paris asking for a draft of our reply,and intimating that unless he could have a copyM. Herriot would not be able to maintain his position.In the absence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Officials of
the Treasury and Foreign Office had thought it necessaryto send a reply to the American Note and to send a copyto M* Herriot.     In order to obtain Ministerial authoritythey had approached the Prime Minister, who was seriouslyindisposed at the time, and had secured his assent tothe preparation and despatch of a Note.     Owing toindisposition, however, he had not seen the actual text(see below).     Late In the evening the Hote had beensubmitted to the Lord President of the Council, who hadbeen assured that it was drawn up in line with theChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s policy.     With this prefacethe Chancellor of the Exchequer read the Note(Appendix III).     He added that he had just seen atelegram from Sir Ronald Lindsay to the effect that theAmerican Secretary of State, speaking to Press represent-atives on December 12th. indicated that if His Majesty&apos;sGovernment made their payment on December 15th and returned no answer to the American Note of December 11ththey would thereby accept the American interpretation of paragraphs 5 and 6 of their Note, as stated in theAmerican Note.     That showed that it had been necessaryto send some kind of Note.The Prime Minister explained that, being indisposed,he had retired early the previous evening and had beenwakened from a deep sleep.     He had not seen the Noteand had only been able to gather a very general impression of the position.     On medical advice he knew that It was risky for him to leave his room to pursue the matter further, . though he had a strong inclinationto do so, as he only realised after the Officials leftthat the Note was to be sent to Paris and he did not quite see the reason for this.     He had not seen the text- 2 -
of the Note, though he accepted full responsibility forall that had been done.The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointedout that the Note was merely a reaffirmation of theGovernment*s previous position.     He thought its despatchhad been absolutely necessary.The Lord President of the Council said that he also had felt that the despatch of the Note was unavoidable.He had been assured that the Note was consistent withthe policy the Chancellor of the Exchequer had in mind,and he had been told of the consultation with the PrimeMinister.     He felt it was rather a serious responsi-bility to take at a late hour, but in the circumstances he had thought there was no alternative.The Prime Minister said he was most anxious thatthe Cabinet should not think that he did not support the note.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs thoughtit was unfortunate that the Note had been sent beforethe Chancellor of the Exchequer had either seen it orhad been communicated with.     All along we had been trying to avoid any suggestion of a European bloc againstAmerica.     It would be awkward if it became known thatthe Note had been sent to Paris before Its delivery inAmerica.     He had understood from the previous cabinet decision that the Note actually sent on December 11thwould not be despatched until just before the 15th.The events of Sunday, however, had necessitated its beingadvanced.     If there were a hostile opposition inParliament they could create an awkward situation outof all this.     It might have been better if the Notehad been kept back until that morning, since M. Herriotdid not meet the Commissions until the same afternoon.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that the urgency of the despatch of the Note had arisen from the telephone message received from Paris on the previous evening.     It was that which had led the Officials to feel so strongly that immediate action was necessary.M. Herriot was to meet the Commissions on the same day(Tuesday, December 13th) at 2 p.nu, and the Chamber at p.m. (afterwards changed to 5 p.m.).     He had promised to explain to the Commissions the reserves with whichthe French Government proposed to accompany their promise to pay, but he could not do so until he knew what our attitude was to be subsequent to the receipt of theAmerican Note of December 11th;    e.g., whether we were going to change our position.     He was under the impression that the Note had been despatched to America andprobably delivered before it could be received in Paris.(NOTE BY THE,.,,SECRETARY.    The actual dates&quot;andTTImes are as follows: -iDespatch of the Note to His Majesty&apos;ambassador In Washington, December 13th,2.55 a.m. (Telegram No.614 to Washington).Delivery of Note at Washington. December12th, before midnight.      (This was possibleowing to the difference in time.) (washington telegram No.557).Despatch of telegram to Lord Tyrrell,13th December, 3.20 a.m.  (Telegram No.212to Paris).Delivery of Note in Paris, December 13th,8 a.m.) .The Chancellor of the Exchequer added that he did notthink we need now be so cautious about the sensitivenessof America to the Idea of a European bloc.     There hadbeen no serious reaction to his own visit with thePrime Minister to Paris.The Secretary of State for War informed the Cabinetthat he had received a telephone message on the subject
the same morning, and had gathered that the Notecommunicated to Lord Tyrrell was merely informationof a Note which had already been sent to washington and delivered before it could possibly be published inParis.     He recalled that he himself had not been inagreement with most of his colleagues as to our payment on December 15th, but, given the policy that had beenadopted, he thought that the Note was a good one.Personally he would have preferred to have had theCabinet summoned even at that late hour.     He thoughtit would be unfortunate if It leaked out that the Notehad been sent with so little Ministerial responsibility.The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointedout that the Note did not involve any change in policy.The Cabinet had decided to pay, under certain conditions.Then the American Note of December 11th had arrivedsomewhat unexpectedly.     The fresh reply was merely areaffirmation of the policy that the Cabinet had saidthat they intended to adhere to.     There might have been serious objections if France had been consulted as tothe contents of the Note.     That, however, was not thecase.     We had merely communicated to France something that had already been sent to Washington.The President of the Board of Education thoughtIt could almost be said that the Permanent Officialswould have been to blame if they had not taken urgentaction.     He did not think that the Government8s casewoxild be at all bad if there should be a leakage.He thought the Note was satisfactory.The Prime Minister said that, on thinking thematter over afterwards, he had felt that it mighthave been better to give M. Herriot a definite pledge
that our general attitude would not he changed withoutsending a copy of the Note.     He did not wish, however,to cast blame on anyone.     An anxious situation had arisen on the previous evening, and there was no doubtthat those who had taken action had felt that it was absolutely necessary.     Moreover, the Note was perfectlyconsistent with the policy of the Cabinet.     He thought,therefore, that the Cabinet should accept the situation.This was generally agreed to.
3.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer Informed theCabinet that he had arranged for gold in London to be earmarked for the Federal Reserve Bank, who would payover the same amount of gold to the United StatesGovernment on December 15th,     This got over thedifficulty of our not being able to ship the goldover before the date at which payment had to be made.Originally he had understood that if the gold was sentonly in English ships it could not reach America beforethe end of February, but now he was informed that itwould all be in America by the end of January.     Thefirst shipment would be made today.4.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he proposed to pay out of revenue.     This would involve anIncrease in the Budget deficit which, he feared, mustbe anticipated.5.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that theBank of England did not want an increase in theFiduciary Issue.     Treasury Officials also thought it unnecessary and undesirable, as it might cause anxietyabroad.The Bank would require the Government to hand oversecurities to compensate them for the loss of gold.Gold did not carry interest, but securities did, andas the securities would be held in the Banking Depart-ment the Bank of England would obtain certain advantage.This might be the subject of criticism.      The Bank,however, was undertaking the cost of packing and shipping the gold, which might be as much as  70,000.6. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed hiscolleagues that under the War Debt Agreements the debt
5 44of Prance was on her own credit only:    that is to say,it was irrespective of what Prance could obtain fromGermany,     Mr. Churchill had made a stipulation that ifPrance paid America she should make some similar payment to us.     Under the Hoover moratorium, payment of Inter-Allied debts had been suspended from June 30, 1931, fora year.     At Lausanne, however, it had been agreed thatno payment should be made until either the LatisanneAgreement was ratified or it had been decided that theAgreement could not be ratified.     If the LausanneAgreements could not be ratified we should go back tothe position prior to the Hoover moratorium, and all our claims against our debtors would be revived.The French and Italian payments were not quarterly, butmonthly.     France now owed us about  5,500,000, andItaly  2,000,000.The Prime Minister pointed out that these werepayable in Sterling.The Chancellor of the Exchequer added that evenif we should make a final agreement with the UnitedStates of America we should have a right to call on ourdebtors to pay a proportionate share of that payment,including the payment we were now making.     It was a mistake, therefore, to suppose that we had remittedany payment.     Payments were only in suspense, with fullrights of subsequent adjustment.7.    The Cabinet then discussed the forthcoming debate in Parliament, and the President of the Boardof Trade expressed the hope that the Chancellor of theExchequer would not belittle the burden thrown upon this country by the payment on December 15th.     He was anxious that it should not be thought, either here or
in the United States of America, that we had made this payment easily.     We ought to take the line thatthe burden was a very heavy one, which must eventuallyfall on the taxpayer.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs expressed the hope, however, that care would be taken not to go too far in this direction.     There were signsof an improvement in trade, and it was most undesirable to damp them down by arousing suspicions of extrataxation.The matter was generally held to be one for the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said thatapparently he would have to open the Debate.     He would much have preferred to hear the criticisms and replyto them, but he gathered that he could hardly avoidspeaking first.The Prime Minister said that there appeared to bea general expectation that he would speak.The Prime Minister&apos;s colleagues pressed himstrongly not to do so, and expressed the view that theHouse would not expect It, as he was known to beindisposed.The matter was left to the Prime Ministerand the Lord President of the Council.k3 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.December 13, 1932.
APPENDIX I.Further Note addressed by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom to the United StatesGovernment relating to the British War Debt.Sir R. Lindsay to the United States Secretary of State.Sir, Washington, December 11, 1932.His Majesty &apos;s Government having received the Note addressedto them by the United States Government on the 7th December,observe with satisfaction that the United States Government welcome the suggestion for a closs examination between the two countries ofthe whole subject dealt with in the British Note of the 1st December.His Majesty&apos;s Government feel that it will be appropriate to reserve for this joint examination their comments on certain of the views expressed in the United States Note of the 7th December, but theythink it right to state that, after further careful consideration, they see no reason to modify the general conclusions set forth in their note of the 1st December.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government will therefore in the presentcommunication deal only with the last portion of the United StatesGovernment&apos;s Note which relates to the immediate question of thepayment on the 15th December. His Majesty&apos;s Government observe that the United States Government recognise the difficulties of effecting transfer, but they remain convinced that no solution otherthan suspension would obviate these difficulties. They note thereforewith profound regret that notwithstanding the arguments containedin the British Note of the 1st December the United States Govern-ment have decided not to recommend this solution to Congress.3&apos;. In view of this decision His Majesty&apos;s Government havedetermined to make payment of the amount due on the 15thDecember under the Funding Agreement of the 18th June, 1923;but they think it desirable to take the opportunity of stating clearlytheir position in regard to this payment and of explaining thecircumstances in which they have arrived at that conclusion.4. For the reasons which have already been placed on recordHis Majesty&apos;s Government are convinced that the system of inter-governmental payments in respect of War Debts as it existed priorto President Hoover&apos;s initiative on the 20th June, 1931, cannot be revived without disaster. Since it is agreed that the whole subject should be re-examined between the United States of America andthe United Kingdom this fundamental point need not be furtherstressed here.5. In the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, therefore, thepayment to be made on the 15th December is not to be regardedas a resumption of the  annual payments  contemplated by the
existing Agreement. It is made because there has not been timefor the discussion with regard to that Agreement to take place, and because the United States Government have stated that in theiropinion such a payment would greatly increase the prospects ofa satisfactory approach to the whole question.6. His Majesty&apos;s Government propose accordingly to treat thepayment on the 15th December as a capital payment, of which account should be taken in any final settlement; and they are making arrangements to effect this payment in gold as being in thecircumstances the least prejudicial of the methods open to them.7. This procedure must obviously be exceptional and abnormal:and His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to urge upon the UnitedStates Government the importance of an early exchange of views with the object of concluding the proposed discussion before the15th June next in order to obviate the risk of a general break-down of existing inter-governmental agreements.I have, &amp;c.E.

APPENDIX IT,Eurtheb. Note Addressed by the United StatesGovernment to His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom relating to the British war debt.The United States Secretary of State to Sir R. Lindsay.Excellency, Washington, December 11, 1932.I learn with satisfaction of the decision of your Governmentto make payment of the amount due on the 15th December underthe Funding Agreement of the 18th June, 1923, but in view of thestatement made in your Note that &quot; in the view of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, therefore, the payment to be made on the 15thDecember is not to be regarded as a resumption of the annual payments contemplated by the existing agreement,&quot; I must call attention to the fact that the Secretary of the Treasury has no authority to accept payment from your Government except as provided under the terms of the Funding Agreement.As I pointed out in my Note of the 23rd November, 1932, thereis reserved to the Congress of the United States the ultimate decision in respect of the funding, refunding or amendment of these inter-Governmental obligations under consideration.The Executive has no power to amend or alter them either directly or by implied commitment.Accordingly, it should be understood that acceptance by theSecretary of the Treasury of funds tendered in payment of the instal-ment cannot constitute approval of or agreement with any conditionor declaration of policy inconsistent with the terms of the agreement.The sum so received must be credited to principal and interest as provided therein.1 therefore assume that in paragraphs 5 and 6 of your Note youare not proposing to make this payment otherwise than in accordancewith the terms of the Funding Agreement, but you are stating your views as to the steps which your Government may desire to proposesubsequently after re-examination of the entire problem.I have emphasised these facts with a view to avoiding any possible future misunderstanding. I believe our future course, as pointed outby our correspondence, is clear.In your first Note of the 13th November you asked for an exchangeof views at the earliest possible moment in respect to the regime of inter-Governmental financial obligations, and in your second Note youwelcomed the expression of our willingness to facilitate such discussions and referred to the desirability of close examinationbetween our Governments of the whole subject in preparation for theInternational Economic Conference.My last Note of the 8th December replied that the President ofthe United States was prepared, through whatever agency may seem
3appropriate, in co-operation with your Government, to survey theentire situation, in which the debt of the British Government to theUnited States necessarily plays a part, and to consider what meansmay be taken to bring about the restoration of stable currencies and exchange, the revival of trade, and the recovery of prices.But meanwhile, as I informed you in my Note of the23rd November, great importance is attached by our Government and people to the maintenance of the original Debt Agreement in force,and that a satisfactory approach to the whole question would be greatlyincreased by the pursuance of such a policy.It would seem to me, therefore, to be undesirable that any steps should be taken which, by causing misunderstanding, would increasethe difficulties that must be overcome in finding an ultimate solutionsatisfactory to both nations.Accept, &amp;c.HENEY L. STIMSON.
APPENDIX III.Further Note addressed by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the united kingdom to the united statesGovernment relating to&quot; the British War Debt.Sir R. Lindsay to the United States Secretary of State.Sir, Washington, December 12, 1932.In replying to the Note of the United States Government of the11th December, His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to emphasise thatthe purpose of their Note of even date was to state clearly their own position in regard to the payment oh the 15th December and to explain the circumstances in which they had decided to make that payment.It was not, of course, the intention of their Note to touch upon any matter affecting the constitutional position of the United StatesGovernment.Their Note should, therefore, be read solely as relating to their own position which they have taken after mature consideration, viz., thatthey are prepared to make the payment on the 15th December in thelight of the considerations set out in their Note of the 11th december and they must reserve the right to recur to these considerations in the examination of the whole question to which the United States Govern-ment have agreed. They would again emphasise the importance of entering upon that examination without loss of time.I have, &amp;c.E. C. LINDSAY.
