U BRITISHL DEBT TOjb united ates.previous inference.      ^atinet 63(32)F.a.1.      The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded theCabinet that, at the Meeting referred to in the margin?they had decided that a Note should be sent to theUnited States of America5        setting forth the facts and arguments in support of a request for a sus-pension of the December payment9 but that the Note wasnot to contain any intimation of our ultimate intentionto pay if our plea was rejected.     At the same time HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington was to ascertain whether certain unofficial suggestions that have comefrom Washington would be acceptable if put forwardofficially.      The British Note had had a good receptionhere but a bad reception in the United States.      Congressseem to have closed their eyes to it, but though it maynot have the effect of averting the necessity of payment on December 15ths  the Note would probably help in theultimate settlement.      The Ambassador&apos;s enquiries had revealed that the United States attitude towards the in-formal suggestions differed fundamentally from the ideaas communicated to His Majesty&apos;s Government.      The formerinsisted that the Bonds which it was proposed that weshould gives instead of being held by the Government3should be marketable and should carry such rates ofinterest as to render them marketable.      That wouldmean that they oould not be taken into consideration inthe negotiations for a permanent settlement.      In viewof this fundamental alteration the Chancellor of theExchequer, after consulting with the Lord Presidentof the Council and the President of the Board of Trade9had rejected the suggestion. .President Hoover&apos;s latest statements made it clearthat there was no prospect of Congress accepting our proposal for a postponement of the December payment.
In the circumstances there appeared to he  three possible courses:-(i) To pay In full;(ii) To request the Secretary of the UnitedStates Treasury to waive the 90 days&apos; notice,required under the Debt   Settlement - for a suspension of the principal of the payment for two years which would release us from$30,000,000 out of a total payment duo of$95,000,000;(iii) To make a counter proposal to make half thepayment in gold and the remainder in Bonds.The Chancellor of the Exchequer did not himself recommendeither alternative (ii)  or (iii) but he felt boundto mention them because the former was advocated by sir frederick Leith Ross and the latter by the Foreign Office.Taking the third method first the Chancellor .of theExchequer felt that to propose this would be humiliatingand would conflict with the general argument of our note which was based, not on our inability to pay, but on theserious re-actions which payment would have on world economy.If wo were to ask to pay half in gold and half in Bondsit would be suggested that our case had not been genuine.- Turning to the second alternative the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer quoted a remarkby Mr. Ogden Mills, the American Secretary to the Treasury,addressed to our Ambassador,  to the effect that no one could stop him from waiving the 90 days &apos; notice except thePresident,  though the latter might possibly think itnecessary to consult Congress.      It had now been suggestedthat Mr. Mills should be asked to ascertain from thePresident whether he would insist on referring the matter to Congress,  and that if he would give an undertakingnot to do so we should adopt this plan.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, however, did not recommend this course.      He recalled that Mr. Stimson2 -
had on one occasion said that Congress required cash andthat nothing else would satisfy them.     If the American secretary to the Treasury postponed, part of the paymentit seemed almost bound to lead to disagreeable remarksin Congress.     Party capital might be made out of theepisode, and when we came to revision of the debtCongress would say that we had already had considerableremission.In the circumstances the Chancellor of the Exchequeradvised the Cabinet to accept neither alternative, but topay in gold.     He thought that this payment should be accompanied by a fresh Note, a draft of which he read to the Cabinet.The course proposed by the Chancellor of theExchequer met with the unanimous approval of the Cabinet.One Member who at an earlier stage of these discussions had felt some difficulty in   agreeing to payment stated that his objections were to a great extentmet by the terms of the draft Note, and that he was nowat one with his colleagues.The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinetthat he did not propose to send the Note at once as hethought a few days ought to be given to the United StatesGovernment to send a reply to our Note, and/or for the presidents statement to Congress.The Cabinet agreed: -(a) That the December instalment of the AmericanWar Debt should be paid in gold:(b) That payment should be accompanied by aNote, the terms of which were read to and approved by the Cabinet.(Note:     A copy of the Note read by theChencellor of the Exchequer isattached to the standard file copyof the Cabinet proceedings).- 3 -
tc) That the Chancellor of the Exchequer shouldtake the Note with him on his visit the same day to the Prime Minister in Paris, and make such use of it in the negotiations with theFrench Government as he and the Prime minister might deem advisable:(d) That the Note should not be presented immediatelybut at a date to be arranged by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and possibly very little beforethe payment was due.(e) That the Note should be published as soon aspossible after its presentation.

PERSIA.3. The Cabinet had before them the followingnihe threat to documents relating to the recent cancellation byPersian Oil the Persian Government of the Anglo-Persian oil company.Companyrs concession:-An Interim Report by the Chiefs ofStaff Sub-Committee (C.P.-419 (33))prepared in accordance with theConclusion of the Cabinet mentionedin the margin.   The Chiefs of Staffdid not recommend any immediatemovement of His Majesty&apos;s Ships,the present dispositions of which arealready favourable, or that any other action of a preliminary natureshould be taken beyond watching the situation carefully.   TheReport contained various recommend-ations in the event of possiblecontingencies, and mentioned thata further Report, dealing with thesematters in greater detail, was in course of preparation:A Memorandum by the permanent under-Secretary of State, ForeignOffice (CP.-421 (32)) in theabsence of the Secretary of State.In this Memorandum the presentposition of the question was described in detail, and theeffect of the Covenant of theLeague of Nations and the optional clause was discussed.   The permanent under-Secretary of State recommendedthat His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Tehranshould continue to take a strong line and to press for the definite with-drawal of the note of cancellationas an essential preliminary to anyresumption of negotiations betweenthe Persian Government and the Company.If the reply should be unsatisfactory,or there should be no reply before,say, the 10th December, he advised that Mr Hoare should inform thePersian Government that the matterwill be brought by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment before the PermanentCourt of International Justice atThe Hague under the Optional Clause,unless the cancellation is withdrawnwithin a week from the date of thatnotification.   The full recommendationsof the Foreign Office are given in theAppendix.,(previous reference:Cabinet 64(32), Con-clusion 3.)F.R.
The procedure suggested in the Foreign office memorandum met with the general approval of theCabinet, who felt that some action was required atonce, that in the circumstances the course proposed was the only one available, and that it was mostimportant not to give the Persians the right of taking us to the Permanent Court of InternationalJustice.    It was assumed that the interlocutory stepsproposed in Conclusion (vi) of the Memorandum wouldearly stage.be taken at an /   and that, in consequence, if the persians took hostile action against the propertyof the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, we should not be debarred from taking the necessary steps for itsprotection.Two points were urged:-First, that before the PersianG-overnment was informed that thematter would be brought before thePermanent Court of InternationalJustice at The Hague, the ForeignOffice should take steps toascertain that the Law Officersof the Crown agreed with theForeign Office as to the strengthof our case.Second, that the Law Officers ofthe Crown should also be consulted as to whether we were -      entitledto bring the Persian government before the Permanent Court ofInternational Justice, since thedispute technically was betweenthe Persian Government and theAnglo-Persian Oil Company.In this connection reference was made to theMavromatos case, in which the Greek Government had brought before the Permanent Court a dispute between a Greek subject and the Palestine Government.    Ithad seemed probable that a majority of the court would have taken the view that a dispute between aprivate individual and a Government could not be tried, and the opposite view had been taken only-7-
owing to the existence of some special provision inthe Palestine Mandate.-It was urged, however, that even if the LawOfficers should advise that the Permanent Court mightrefuse to admit the case, the Government ought tomake the attempt to bring it before the Court, since their hands would thereby be strengthened in takingwhatever measures might prove necessary to protect the Anglo-Persian Oil Company1s property.It was further suggested that, when informing thePersian Government of our intention to bring thematter before the Permanent Court of InternationalJustice, we should warn them at the same time of outintention to apply for an Interlocutory Judgment, andthat if any action was taken on their part that wasdetrimental to British subjects or interests, theGovernment would take all necessary steps to protect them.The Report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committeewas noted, but the Cabinet were informed that it would&apos;be difficult for the Departments concerned in any wayto forestall false reports, referred to in Paragraph23 and Conclusion (8).    If, however, any such reports,which would have an adverse effect, were observed bythe Anglo-Persian Oil Company and were, brought to theofficial notice of the Departments concerned, theywould be considered, with a view to an appropriatecontradiction.In connection with the Chiefs of Staff Report alsothe attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the factthat existing schemes for the protection of Anglo-Persian property did not take into account an aggression by the Persian Government.   As that was now a possiblecontingency it was suggested that the Chiefs of Staff-R-
Sub-Committee ought to be instructed to give their attention to it and to draw up any necessary plans.(At this point the Cabinet adjournedconsideration of this question whilethe presence of the parliamentary under-Secretary of State was secured.After his arrival the subject was resumed.)The Lord President of the Council explained tothe Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State the points on which the opinion of the Law Officers was desired.There was some discussion as to the preciseprocedure which would be followed.   Earlier in theMeeting a desire had been expressed that the case should be lodged at :the Permanent Court at once,including an application for an InterlocutoryJudgment, so that if the Persians took overt actionof any kind against the oilfields we should be enabled to put in hand protective steps .   The Cabinet were reminded, however, that some days, and perhaps aweek, would be required before a complete case couldbe lodged at the Hague Court, and that it was somewhatdifficult to lodge the claim unless the complete case,with all relevant documents, could be lodged at thesame time.   The Cabinet were also reminded that, inthe view of the Foreign Office, the Persians mightconcede what we required without the necessity of taking the case to the Permanent Court.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve generally the procedure proposed by the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs in CP.-421 (32):(b) That the Law Officers of the Crownshould be consulted at once on thefollowing points:-(i) As to whether our case for thePermanent Court of internationalJustice at the  ague is a soundone:(ii) As to whether the case is withinthe jurisdiction of the Permanent-9-
Court of International Justice  inso much, as technically it appearsto be a dispute between the PersianGovernment and a British Company.The Law Officers should be asked togive their opinion on these points at the earliest moment, and, ifpossible, the same afternoon.(c) That even though the advice of theLaw Officers on (b)(ii) is in.the negative, we should, if possible,submit our claim, to the PermanentCourt, which should be put in handwithout delay:(d) That in submitting our claim to thePermanent Court we should ask for anInterlocutory Judgment, as indicatedin Conclusion (vi )&apos;  of the ForeignOffice Memorandum (CP.-421 (32)j:(e) ^hat the Persian Government, whenthey are informed of our intentionto refer the matter to The Hague court, should also be notified ofour intention to apply at once foran Interlocutory Judgment, and shouldbe warned that if, while the case isbefore the Court, they take any action that is detrimental to Britishsubjects oT property, we shall take all necessary action for their pro-tection:(f) To take note of the Interim Reportby the Chiefs of Staff Subt-Coirroittee(CP.-419 (32)):(g) That the Secretary to the cabinet should inform Colonel Medlicott, therepresentative of the Anglo-persian oil Company who advised the Chiefs ofStaff Sub-Committee, that if theCompany hear of false rumours affect-ing the position of the Company or its employes, he should notify themto the Foreign Office or ColonialOffice (according as whether the reportemanates from foreign territory or froma Colony, Protectorate or mandated territory), and that these departments would, consider whether a contradictioncould with advantage be issued:(h) That the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committeeshould be enjoined, in submitting afurther Report or Reports, not to overlook the possibility of aggression by the Persian Government.

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C.P.415(32))covering a Memorandum on Persia by the permanent under-Secretary of State,      This Memorandum provided a commentary on the Memorandum circulated by theSecretary of State for India (CP, 371(32)), whichwas discussed at the Meeting of the Cabinet referredto in the margin, and put forward some of the considerations that have weighed with the ForeignOffice in recent negotiations with Persia.The Secretary of State for India informed hiscolleagues of his intention to discuss the matter with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
INDIA.FinancialSafeguards(previous reference:Cabinet 38(33)? Con-elusion 1.)f.R.5.      The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary of State for India (CP.-418 (33)) covering the following documents on the question of financial responsibility and Safeguards:-A Note by the Secretary of State forIndia (0.1,(32) 17), dated August 10,1932, covering a Note on certain aspects of financial safeguards,dated August 2,  19 32, drawn up byExperts e and covering also -A Report by Financial Experts    entitled&quot;No.8. Financial Safeguards&quot;  (C,1,(32)36) :    andA Second Report of Financial Advisers,No. 18, on Financial Safeguards(C .1,(32)  52) .The Conclusions of the Cabinet india committee on which the Secretary ofState desired to obtain the approvalof the Cabinet are summarised in thelatter document as follows:-&quot;The Committee in the first placeaccepted without modification the&quot;normal&apos; safeguards which are summarised in the Appendix toC.I.(32) 17, and which are alreadyembodied in the proposals for a federal Constitution now beforethe Committee.   The Bill wouldcontain no provisions governinga transitional period between theestablishment of Federation andthe setting up of a Reserve Bank,but on the assumption that a reserve bank would be in existence on theestablishment of Federation woxildprovide for a responsible finance minister from the outset and forthe transfer of financial responsi-bility, subject to the &apos;normal&apos;safeguards .   The Bill would, however,contain a provision that the partof the Act setting up a federal government would not be brought intooperation until a Resolution to thisend had been adopted by bothHouses.   The proposals for a federal constitution already contain sucha provision.   But at the Conferenceand in Select Committee it would,no doubt, be explained that Parlia-ment would not be asked to passsuch a Resolution until the general conditions were such that this partof the Act could be brought into forcewithout endangering the financial stability of India&quot;.
The Secretary of State for India informed theCabinet that this question was the most difficult ofall the questions before the Round Table Conferencesince all the financial arguments were in one direction and all the political arguments in the other.     Unlessfinancial responsibility could be transfered it seemedalmost impossible to set up a Federal Government.^/  Thequestion had confronted the Government for two years.So far it had been evaded but now it had to be faced.He informed the Cabinet that the Governor of the Bankof England and other people in the City, as well as theTreasury experts, disliked talk of transfer at any time.The matter had been considered by the Cabinet Committeewhere the Chancellor of the Exchequer had proved mosthelpful and instructive, and eventually the followingposition had been reached:-(i) The palliative safeguards suggestedfrom time to time and described in theMemorandum before the Cabinet were agreedto be of no value while calculated toirritate Indian opinion:TVI/W&apos; JtriJlili&apos; CtsAsL-(ii) The only solid safeguard was a^reserve bank with financial reserves and with amplepowers.The difficulty was as to when the conditions wouldbe sufficiently favourable for the establishment of theReserve Bank.     This pre-supposed a balanced budget,a steady exchange and the provision of sufficientfinancial reserves.      It was impossible to say when these conditions would be realised.      In the circumstances the Cabinet Committee felt that the best plan would beto include the Reserve Bank in the Indian ConstitutionBill.       The institution of a Federal Government wouldin any case take some time, and it was possible that bythat time it might be possible to get a Reserve Bankestablished and to transfer a*i financial responsibility,- 13 -
If not simultaneously at least not very long afterthe establishment of the Federal Government.     all this depended, however, on events outside the Govern-ment&apos;s control.     It was impossible for them to do more than promise their good-will and assist In bringing the Reserve Bank into existence, but even if the reserve bank was brought into being It was essential for theGovernment to reserve in their own hands the question ofthe date of transfer of financial responsibility.One of the difficulties arose out of the large amount of short-term obligations that had to be met.     In thesecircumstances the Government should, aim at making theestablishment of Federal Government and of a reserve bank, roughly simultaneous in time.     This could bedone either by saying that there would be no Federationuntil a Resolution to that effect had been passed by both Houses, or that there should be no transfer offinancial responsibility until a Resolution had been passed by the Houses.     That was the proposal that theCabinet Committee made.     He felt tt necessary, however,to warn the Cabinet that the Governor of the Bank ofEngland was nervous even of this proposal.      If, however,we did not go as far as this we should be faced witha very serious political situation in India, possiblyso serious as to break India&apos;s credit.      Consequently,in making this recommendation to the Cabinet theSecretary of State warned them of the above risks, and added the possibility that the Indian Hindus might be; Vdriven to leave the Round Table Conference altogether.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that thequestion was an extremely grave one.     He intenselydisliked giving any pledge or avowing any intention ofhanding   over financial responsibility to India at any- 14 -
date.     He did not believe that the Indians were reallycapable of handling this question.     They might destroyIndia&quot;s credit within a very short space of time.As a practical man, however, he agreed that we had nowgot in such a position that if we did not give some indication of our intention eventually to hand overfinance we might break up the Round Table Conference.He had done his best to help but he felt bound to warn the Cabinet of the danger.      In particular he was apprehensive lest we should make statements that india would interpret in one way and we the other.     If wecommunicated our apprehensions in full to the Indiansthey would say that this proved that our proposals meantnothing.     If we did not there was a danger that later on we should be accused of bad faith.      It might be saidthat in any event we had to run risks.     To estimatethese risks it was necessary to understand the facts.The proposal was to set up a Reserve Bank, which wouldbe mentioned in our own legislation. The setting up ofthe Bank, however, would have to be completed by Indianlegislation.      The passage of such a Bill,involving asit did a Reserve Bank under British control, by theIndian legislature,would be rather a severe test.He did not believe that we could set up a Reserve bank and a Federal Constitution simultaneously.     In thisconnection he quoted the following phrase from one ofthe experts reports, attached to CP. 418(52):-&quot;On the other hand, it is also desirable thattoo much stress should not be laid on theestablishment of a Reserve Bank, lest theimpression be created that this alone would stand in the way of the introduction of federation and that Parliament would be askedto adopt the necessary Resolution bringing the Act into force as soon as a Reserve Bankhad been established&quot; (CI. (32)52).- 15 -
The experts had feared two things (i) premature attemptto set up a Reserve Bank before the conditions were favourable and (ii) lest the setting up of the reserve bank should be a signal for setting up a Central Govern-ment.     He did not think the two actions could takeplace simultaneously.     The Reserve Bank would requireto be tested.     City opinion would want to know how theBank was functioning before they co-operated.The real difficulty was in raising the necessaryfinance.     He was told that if a whisper of transfer ofresponsibility to India/^was heard it would be sufficientto stop any loan from the City.     He gathered that indian representatives were to meet representatives of the City,and he hoped that they would take as definite the viewsthat they would hear on the financial issue, and thatthey would not attribute them merely to unwillingness toanhand over the Government of India to/alien people.     Itwas important that the Indian representatives should bebrought to realise that they could not raise money withoutcreating confidence.When the Indian representatives did realise this fact it would not be long before they would come to theCabinet and inform them that they could not commandsufficient confidence and   suggest that the UnitedKingdom Government should guarantee the loans.     Thatwould raise   a   liability that he, the Chancellor of theExchequer, could not contemplate.While accepting the Secretary of Statefs proposal,however, the Chancellor of the Exchequer asked the Cabinetto take note of the warning he had given.In the course of the subsequent discussion theCabinet were informed that safeguards had been provided to ensure the balancing of the Indian budget.- 16 -
The Lord Chancellor, while recognising the forceof the financial aspects, said that all concernedin the Indian negotiations were agreed that somethingmust be done on the political side, otherwise therewould be chaos in India that would cost us dear.He hoped, however, that no promises would be made asto any definite dates.    On the legal side of theIndian problem the outlook two years ago had appearedhopeless, and now 95 per cent, of the difficulties had been surmounted.   He hoped that the same might prove to be true of finance.   It was necessary,however, to bring home to the Indian representativesthe realities.   Consequently he attached greatimportance to their meeting with representatives ofthe City.   He hoped, however, that the latter would put their case, not from the point of view of whatbutwas best for England,/for India itself.   He warned the Cabinet that the Indian representatives would soon be asking for a definite date for Federation.He hoped that it would not be given.   What they desired was that it should be &quot;not later than&quot; suoh-and-such a date.   He believed that in the end   11would come right, but he was opposed to any definitedat e.The President of the Board of Education agreed in avoidance of a date.   He himself had begun-by holding views that were not entirely different, but were on parallel lines to those advanced by theSecretary of State.     He still entertained his own views, but as a practical man he recognised thedifficulties of transfer of financial responsibility.He wanted the Cabinet, however, to realise that the indians would interpret the Prime Minister&apos;s statemert-17-
last December to mean that finance would betransferred.   We should have to justify the policynow proposed by changed conditions, and the Cityrepresentatives might help in this aspect. Hewarned the Cabinet that the plan of tying thetransfer of financial responsibility to the estab-lishment of a Reserve Bank and the transfer of federation might mean that Federation would be suspended owing to finance.    If, at any time when on other grounds Federation might be completed, it hadto be postponed owing to finance, a difficult position would arise.   He thought, therefore, thatthe Cabinet should not close their minds to thepossibility of adopting Federation without neces-sarily involving the transfer of financial responsi-bility.    He expressed some apprehensions also as tothe proposal that action should only be taken on aResolution of both Houses of Parliament.   He thoughtit possible that the House of Lords might prove a difficulty,The Secretary of State for War. as a member ofthe Cabinet Committee, while sharing the Chancellorof the Exchequers anxities, supported the Secretaryof State for India.   His reason for sharing theChancellor of the Exchequer *s anxieties was that wewere committed to establish responsible governmentin India, and he regarded the control of financeas a central element in responsible government.There was no doubt the Prime Minister&apos;s statementlast December was meant to indicate an Intention ofestablishing a Central Government.   The best opinionthat the Committee had been able to obtain consideredthese safeguards to be the most suitable.   He thought
It. 2 2it could be said that the safeguards -were as much inthe interests of India as of the United Kingdom.Consequently he supported the Secretary of State&apos;sproposals.    He was, however, not very sanguine thatthe Indian representatives would accept thesesafeguards.The Lord President of the Council summed up thatit was the general desire of the Cabinet to supportthe Secretary of State for India, to whom he offeredvery warm congratulations on the success -of his efforts.The Secretary of State for India said that hewould take into consideration the proposals of thePresident of the Board of Education.The Cabinet agreed  To approve the proposals of theSecretary of State for India.-IP-

TheseSocieties had reduced the level ofthe terms which the Minister had previously been informally givento understand they would require.They are prepared, at present rates,to make advances, under guarantee,at rates not exceeding 4^? per cent,in London and the Home Counties, and4 per cent, in the Provinces, withindications of possible lower ratesof interest in particular areas.The Minister was satisfied that the revised proposals submitted on their behalf would, if parliamentary sanction is obtained for the guarantees,enable them to play a very useful partin a field which is new to them, namely,the provision of small houses to belet to members of the working classeswhose circumstances are such that theycannot ordinarily acquire housesthemselves:A Memorandum by the Minister of Health(H.A.-41 (32)) covering the draftHousing (Financial Provisions) Bill,prepared in accordance with thedecisions of the Cabinet at theMeeting referred to in the margin:together with the following Conclu-sions of the Committee of Home Affairs(H.A.C, 12th Conclusions (32)):-(l) To approve the Piousing (financial provisions) Bill in the form ofthe draft annexed to H.A.-41 (32),subject to any drafting or other minor alterations that may bethought necessary or desirable:(2) That, in pursuance of Cabinet 64(32), Conclusion 7, the MinisterOf Health should be authorised tointroduce the Bill in the Houseof Commons forthwith, with a viewto its receiving a Second Readingbefore the Christmas Recess.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that thefollowing formula in C.P.-420 appeared to be a newone :-&quot;They now proposed that the advancesunder guarantee should be made for periods as long as 30 years and at per cent, under their current ratesof interest for ordinary loans&quot;.-20-IoUSING POLICY,Phe Housing[financial provisions)Bill.(previous previous reference:Cabinet 64(32), Con-conclusion 7 .)1
That raised the question that 30 years was. too- shortto enable houses to be let at 10/- including rates.On these terms a house costing  350 could not be letat less than about 10/- a week exclusive of rates.Further, if the Building Societies oould not comebelow 4 per cent, that meant that their ordinaryrates would continue to be 5 per cent,   One objectof the Conversion Loan had been to lower general rate-eof interest, and this applied to Building Societiesas to everyone else.   He hoped that sooner or laterrates of interest would oome do?rn% and consequentlyhe did not want to encourage continuance of present rates.   He suggested that the Minister of health should include in his formula the words &quot;with aminimum of 3 per cent&quot;.The Minister of Health undertook to write to the Building Societies andto ask them to add these words.

Cancellation of Anglo-Persian Oil Company&apos;s Concession.Extract from Memorandum by the Permanent Under-Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.13. The recommendations of the Foreign Office may therefore be summarisedfollows :. (i) That Mr. Hoare&apos;s new proposal, involving a radical modification of thedemand already made to the Persian Government for the withdrawalof the note of cancellation, cannot be adopted without serious loss offace for His Majesty&apos;s Government,(ii) That consequently His Majesty&apos;s Minister should continue to take astrong line and to press for the definite withdrawal of the note of cancellation as an essential preliminary to any resumption of negotiations between the Persian Government and the Company.(iii) That if the official demand for withdrawal already made should elicitan unsatisfactory reply, or if no reply should be received by, say, the10th December, Mr. Hoare should inform the Persian Governmentthat the matter will be brought by His Majesty&apos;s Government beforethe Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague underthe Optional Clause, unless the cancellation is withdrawn within aweek from the date of that notification.(iv) That this threat should be put into effect by His Majesty&apos;s government without hesitation if the need should arise.(v) That even in the face of grave provocation, such as a serious attempt to hamper the activities of the Company, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould be on weak and dangerous ground in resorting to forciblemeasures, whether of protection or retaliation, until the resources of. pacific settlement provided by the League Council and The Hague court have been exhausted,(vi) That it is nevertheless essential to provide against possible Persianattacks on the Company&apos;s property and premises in Persia while theproceedings are pending before the Court. The Statute and Pules ofProcedure of the Court, however, provide a procedure intended foruse in such circumstances, and it is the A*iew of the Foreign Office thatrecourse should be had to this procedure before anything in the natureof forcible action on Persian territory is contemplated. Article 41 ofthe Statute of the Court provides as follows : &quot;The Court shall have the power to indicate, if it considers that circumstances so require, any provisional measures which ought to betaken to reserve the respective rights of either party.&quot; Pending the final decision, notice of the measures suggestedshall forthwith be given to the parties and the Council.&quot;And article 57 of the Rules of Court is in the following terms :-&apos;&apos; An application made to the Court by one or both of the parties,for the indication of interim measures of protection, shall have priority over all other cases. The decision thereon shall be treated asa matter of urgency, and if the Court is not sitting, it shall be convenedwithout delay by the President for the purpose.&quot;If no application is made, and if the Court is not sitting, thePresident may convene the Court to submit to it the question whether such measures are expedient.&quot; In all cases, the Court shall only indicate measures of protectionafter giving the parties an opportunity of presenting their observa-tions on the subject.&quot;It is obvious that in the event of the Court indicating &apos;&apos; measures ofprotection &quot; and the Persian Government refusing to carry them out,the case of His Majesty&apos;s Government for taking such action as mightbe absolutely necessary to protect the property of the Company wouldbe greatly strengthened. We could, of course, inform the Persiansof our intention to apply to the Court for &quot; provisional measures,&quot;and indicate that, in the event of their not complying with any such measures which might be indicated by the Court, we must reserve out-right to take such action as the circumstances might require.[7950-1]
1.     His Majesty1s Government note with profoundregret that - notwithstanding the argumentscontained in the British Note of 1st instant - theU.S. Government have decided not to recommend to congress the suspension of the War Debt paymentdue from the United Kingdom on December 15th.In view of this decision His W[ajesty*s&quot; Government have determined to make payment of theamount duej    but they think it desirable to takethe opportunity of stating clearly their position inregard to It and of explaining the circumstances inwhich they have arrived at that conclusion.2.     For the reasons which have already been fullyset out His Majesty&apos;s Government are convinced thatthe system of inter-governmental payments in respectof War Debts, as It existed prior to president hoover&apos;s initiative on June 20, 1931, cannot be revived without ultimate disaster.     Since theU.S. Government have already expressed their willingness that a discussion in regard to theBritish War Debt Agreement should take place thisfundamental point need not be further stressed.3.      In the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government,therefore, the payment to be made on the 15thinstant Is not to be regarded as a resumption ofthe annual payments contemplated by the existing agreement.     It is made because there has not been time for the discussion with regard to that agreement to take place, and because the U.S.Government have stated that in their opinion sucha payment would greatly Increase the prospects ofa satisfactory approach to the whole question.
4.     His Majesty&apos;s Government propose accordingly to treat the payment on the 15th instant as a capital payment, of which account should be takenin any final settlement, and they are making arrangements to effect this payment in gold.5.     This procedure must obviously be exeptional and abnormal:    and His Majesty&apos;s Government desireto urge upon the U.S. Government the importance of concluding the proposed discussion before the15 June next in order to obviate the risk of ageneral breakdown of existing agreements.
