INDIA.-Tableinference.previous reference:Cabinet 67(32)    Gon-clusion 4.)1.   The Secretary of State for India made a statement to the Cabinet to acquaint them with progress In theIndian Round-Table Conference and in order to obtainauthority as to the line which he was to take at the closing of the present Meetings,    On the whole, matters were not going too badly at these Meetings,.   There wasone difficult point to surmount on financial safeguards.He could assure the Cabinet, however, that there wasno risk of a break-away, although there might be some differences en points of detail.   He was not proposing to issue a White Paper similar to those issued afterprevious Meetings of the Round-Table Conference.   Therewould, however, be a number of Reports from committees which would be embodied in a final document that wouldbe published.   These Reports, as at previons sessions,would consist mainly of a summary of the differentopinions expressed, tefc^-4fee^4fe-i t e1 Pa per.....w Id-1 o onfrfrMano series of Resolutions.    Either he himself or theLord Chancellor would have to make a speech at the close of the general debate.    They would be careful to base themselves on the White Paper and the decisions ofthe Cabinet.   He was anxious to give as much satisfactionas he could to the different sections of the Conference,and, fortunately, was in a position to do this.   without going into detail, he mentioned such points as the separation of Sindh from Bombay, which the Moslemsurgently desired;    the creation of a separate province of Orissa, as desired by Hindus-;    and the great progress on Federal finance-, on which (apart from the questionof safeguards) more progress had been made than could have been expected;   also the acceptance of theDavidson Report, which would please the States.   Byannouncing such points as the above, a good deal ofsatisfaction could be given to many sections of the-1-
Conference while avoiding any general bloc   against us .The Chancellor of the Exchequer congratulated theSecretary of State for India on the skill with whichhe had steered the Conference.   There were two points on which he had felt some concern after reading thedraft Report on the question of financial safeguards.His first point was a phrase in the Report which mightbe interpreted to mean that the British Governmentwould provide the reserves required to establish theReserve Bank.   The second, point was that the Reportseemed to indicate that as soon as the Reserve Bankis in operation, Federal Government could be set up;whereas he felt sure that a period of waiting andtesting would have to intervene.   He had written tothe Secretary of State on these points.   He explainedthat it was mainly a question of the emphasis givento certain points in the Report.As regards the first point the Secretary of Stateexplained that the Indians were under the impression that they themselves would be able to find the capitalnecessary W*-grirvi-d-e bho-r-eg-reserve-s- for the reserve bank.   He thought that the Indians themselves wouldmake reservations which would show that they did notmisinterpret the Report.   He undertook to givecareful consideration to the Chancellor of theExchequer^ letter. and paid a tribute to the invalua-ble collaboration of his colleagues on the UnitedKingdom Delegation.
Subject to the above, the cabinet approved the general line whichthe Secretary&quot;of State proposed totake at the final Meeting of the round-Table Conference.(At this point the Lord Chancellor and theSecretary of State for India withdrew.)
2. The Cabinet bad before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies (C.P.-435(32)) proposing to instruct the Governor of Malta to exercise his powers of reservation in respect ofa Bill to amend the Criminal Laws which had recentlybeen introduced by Ministers in the Maltese Legisla-ture if the Bill was passed by both Houses.   this bill was of a very sweeping character, designed topenalise any expression of opinion derogatory tothe Roman Catholic religion, and contained a clausewhich is equally designed to penalise criticism ofany other cult tolerated by law, but provided thatin that case the punishment should be reduced by twodegrees (by about half).   As the Bill was not onlyobnoxious and improper but also a clear abuse of thepowers which had been conferred on the Malta Legisla-ture, the Secretary of State proposed, after hisreservation as above, to advise His Majesty not tosignify his assent to it.(Mr Eden, Parliamentary Under-Secretary,Foreign Office, was present during this discussion.)The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Cabinet that the procedure of the Malta cabinet was somewhat peculiar, and the present Bill had been introduced by a Minister in the Malta Cabinet apparentlywithout Cabinet approval, and it was not certain thatit would be proceeded with.   The Foreign Office had suggested that,if the Bill was proceeded with, they
Italianpropagandas-fee^3?4--&amp;o4--ge further-he?.This was agreed to by the Cabinet.The Secretary of State for the Colonies thenexplained to the Cabinet that there was now no doubtthat Maltese Ministers were in touch with the ItalianGovernment and were concerting violent Italianpropaganda in Malta.   One of the Maltese Ministerswas in daily contact with the appropriate italian minister on all kinds of questions of detail of italian propaganda.    There was no doubt that SignerMussolini had given, whether wittingly or       /, /.unwitt ingly, miologging infunnobieni on this subject.The Governor of Malta had power under the letters patent to deal with the question, since, without consulting the Maltese Ministers, he was able to issue an Ordinance requiring&quot; aliens to have a licence.The Foreign Office had now drafted a Despatch to Romeinstructing His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to tell-signor mussolini that the position was an impossible one;explaining that the Governor of Malta would have toissue an Ordinance to deal with it;    and suggesting that the Head of the State in Italy should forestallany drastic application of the Ordinance by ensuring that propaganda was stopped.   As action would have tobe taken during the Recess the Secretary of State felt bound to report it to the Cabinet,The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the proposals of theSecretary of State for the colonies in C.P.-435 (32) for instructing theGovernor of Malta to exercise his powers of reservation in respect tothe Bill to amend the Criminal Lawsreferred to therein, and, afterreservation, for advising His Majestynot to signify his assent to it:tww^ t^**- -!2   Foreign Office should^^rpr^ach theiJU/W tU^U. ^^Tlr  Vatican with ajyd^rTo their suggest-, t-/^*g- ing to th^A-f^ohbishop of Malta that:
(c) To approve the action proposed bythe Secretary of State for theColonies for dealing with Italianpropaganda in Malta:(d) mo leave full discretion to theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs to send a Despatch toHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Romewith the same object.(Mr Eden withdrew at this point.)
nigB BRITISHm DEBT TOUNITEDSTATES of America .(previous reference:Cabinet 66(38), Con-clusion 2.)3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer made a statement to the Cabinet as to the present position in thematter of the American War Debt.   The President ofthe United States had sent a new message to congress on December 20th, in the course of which he had madea certain number of rather disputable propositions.For example, he had said that the request for postpone-ment of the December payment was refused because itwould have impaired the integrity of existing agree-ments .   This was a. thesis ttea4.....tho -e^fefertff- - - of theHoover moratorium 3cs^M-^hra-3a4i$ -^usJiapin.   president hoover had indicated that exploration of the Debtsproblem must precede the World Financial and EconomicConference, and that, though discussions could not be concluded before March 4th, they should begin as soonas possible.   The Chancellor himself had had in mind that it would be desirable to call the attention ofthe President to the need for further discussion onthe subject, and had acttially drafted a Despatch to besent to America shortly after Christmas, of which he gave the general lines to the Cabinet.   The previous-evening, he had received a message from the Prime Minister,which he read to the Cabinet (Appendix).The discussion showed that the general view of theCabinet, subject to the Prime Minister&apos;s agreement, wasin favour of emissaries proceeding to Washingtonshortly after Christmas, if the United States Govern-ment agreed.   As the discussions could not be completed before March 4th it was felt to be inadvisable that ministers or other plenipotentiaries should be sent.What the Cabinet felt was required was someone who could indicate clearly what lines of negotiation were likely to produce agreement and what were not, without being able to commiti the Government.   For this purpose
Government Officials, such as Sir Warren Fisher andSir Frederick leith Ross, were felt to he suitable.It would be desirable to approach the American Govern-ment with this proposal, and it was realised that ifCongress should not permit the President to enter into further conversations it might be necessary to publish the Despatch.The Cabinet agreed  To authorise the Chancellor of theExchequer to consult the PrimeMinister and the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and, subject totheir assent, to send a Despatch tothe United States of America drawnup on the above lines.-8-
THE world economic ANDFINANCIALCONFERENCE,(previous reference:Cabinet 62(32), Con-clusion 13.)a4.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed theCabinet that the Preparatory Commission for the world economic and Financial Conference was due to re-assemble on January 9th.   This only left them a fortnight within which to draw up the Agenda for theWorld Conference,    Unless the discussions were morefortunate than on the last occasion, the Agenda would consist only of a series of contradictory opinions.The question would then arise as to whether theConference ought to be convened in such circumstances.His own view was that if the Conference was to be a success it was desirable to get the American War Debtout of the way first and to secure some agreementbetween the leading Powers on the major issues beforethe Conference.   At present, both on monetary andeconomic matters, the Governments of the UnitedKingdom, the United States of America, France andGermany were very wide apart.    Unless some measureof agreement could be reached, the Conferenceappeared to be doomed to failure.    He suggested thatif the Experts could not reach an agreement it mightbe useful for Ministers of the countries concerned to have some preparatory interchanges of views.Subject to the Prime Minister&apos;s agreement, therefore,he was inclined to suggest that it- might be put intofefel^-^MT^g^oT^Irn^-^gpeyt-^ thai theyouoh pr upmsri and that the date of the conference might be made dependent on the progress made byMinist ers.In the course of the discussion similar views were expressed.    It was urged that without some such exchanges of views, as proposed by the Chancellorof the Exchequer, it would be impossible to obtain a
success at the Conference, and that it was especially important to get the question of War Debts out of theway first,    It was proposed also that the Expertsmight suggest a series of questions which ought toform the subject of an exchange of views between theMinisters of the countries primarily concerned, beforethe Agenda Paper of the Conference was finally fixed.The Cabinet authorised the Chancellorof the Exchequer to inform the PrimeMinister that they agreed generally in his views as summarised above.
RUSSIA.?rade with.(previous reference:Cabinet 52(32), Con-elusion 4.)Russian Com-mercialAgreementNegotiations5.      The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-440(32)) on the subject of the negotiations which havealready begun with the Soviet Government for a new treaty or Agreement to. replace the Temporary Commer-cial Agreement which was denounced on October 17,1932.   This Memorandum dealt almost entirely withthe question of debts.   After consultation with theChancellor of the&apos; Exchequer and the President of theBoard of Trade, the Secretary of State submitted thefollowing recommendation for Cabinet approval:-&quot;Inasmuch as notice has now beengiven to terminate the TemporaryCommercial Agreement with the soviet union, and negotiations for a new agreement have now begun, and inasmuch as it would seem inadvisable to intro-duce the question of Russian debts andBritish claims against the SovietGovernment into the course of these negotiations, the Cabinet shouldprovisionally decide to maintain theprevious policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in keeping the questionof debts and claims apart from thenegotiations for a commercial agree-ment.&quot;&apos;The Secretary of State further suggested that at anearly opportunity in the course of the negotiations the British representatives should make the followingreservation of our rights in this connection:-&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom remind the SovietGovernment that there are debts and claims, both Governmental and private,outstanding against them&apos;    that theexistence of these debts and claimshas been recognised on several occa-sions by the Soviet Government:    thattheir settlement was one of the condi-tions for the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two States in1929;    and that the negotiations onthis subject which took place during19 30 and 19 31 were discontinued owingto the insistence of the soviet Govern-ment that financial facilities shouldbe placed at their disposal, before they would consider compensation forany categories of claims.   His Majesty&apos;s- 11 -
Government in the United Kingdomdesire to record that they maintain and assert both their own claims and those of their nationals.They trust that the SovietGovernment are still animated bythe desire which they have expressed on former occasions to settle thisquestion by negotiation on a just and equitable basis at the earliestconvenient opportunity.   Theyconsider that the negotiation ofa permanent Treaty of commerce and Navigation must be accompaniedby a satisfactory settlement ofthese debts and claims;    and theymust therefore regard any commercial agreement which may be negotiatedmeanwhile as being of a temporary and transitional character pending a final disposal of this question.&quot;The Cabinet approved the Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs(CP. 440(52)).    &apos;
6.       The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (CP.-453 (32)) on Russian Timber.    Circulated with his Memorandum wasa Note summarising discussions which had taken placein connection with a proposed contract for thepurchase for next season, by a group of some 170firms in this country known as Timber Distributors,Limited, of a bulk quantity of soft wood from Russia.The President of the Board of Trade gave warning that it would be necessary presently to decide theattitude to be adopted towards the request for action under Article XXI of the Ottawa-United Kingdom-Canada Agreement, which we may expect to receive fromthe Canadian Government and of which warning hasalready been received.   It was not necessary at thisstage to take any action in regard to the proposedcontract, which was the subject of the Memorandum,and so long as the present Agreement with Russiaremains in force (i.e. until April 17, 1933) it isnot possible for us to discriminate against Russiantimber.   Much would turn on the way the forthcoming negotiations with Soviet Russia shaped.   The threat ofthe exclusion of Russian timber was a bargaining counter which we could not afford to throw away.The Cabinet were informed that Mr. Bennett,the Prime Minister of Canada, had been kept informed asto the position, and on the occasion of his recent visit had not raised the question of this contract.The Syndicate were aware that any contract theyconclude may be nullified if His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare obliged to prohibit the importation of the timber,and that no rights can be established in virtue ofsuch a contraet.
RADE WITH[JSSIA.sport CreditsreviousReference:Cabinet 52(32), Con-clusion 4.)7.     The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (CP. 442(32)) onthe subject of Export Credits for Trade with Russia.After setting forth the views of the Advisory Committeeand the present position of the question, the Presidentof the Board of Trade stated that, with the concurrence   -of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who had agreed tohis proposals on the understanding that we are not committed to guarantees amounting to more than  4.millions in the year (this being the amount of Billsmaturing during the year), he had requested theAdvisory Committee to continue substantially at thepresent rate and on the present terms:    that is tosay, they would continue for the present to recommendguarantees covering exports at the rate of some 5,000,000 a year with a maximum of 18 months&apos; credit.As before, no announcement would be made as to theamount of credits available, and they would endeavourto maintain a strict control of the rate at whichthese facilities are made available to Britishexporters, taking account of all the relevant factors.The Secretary of State for War said that for reasons with which the Cabinet were, he thought, familiar,he objected to export credits to Russia, and he recalled that on a previous, occasion he had been allowed to register his dissent (Cabinet 25(32), Conclusion 7),He did not wish to take up the time of the Cabinet bygoing into the matter again in detail, but he asked the Lord President once more to allow him to registerhis dissent as an exception to the general rule to thecontrary.     The Lord President agreed to this.Subject to the dissent of the Secretary of Statefor War, the Cabinet agreed:-To approve the policy set forth by thePresident of the Board of Trade in CP. 442(32).- 14 -i
WFOUNDLAND.     8.     The Chancellor of the Exchequer Informed thenancial Cabinet that he had been faced with the unpleasantition of.... contingency of a financial default by Newfoundland onevious December 28th.     The finances of this Dominion wererence:&quot;net 92(31), very unsatisfactory,   the revenue being short ofonclusion 7).requirements..     It was difficult to see how Newfound-land was to meet its loans in future unless pricesrose..    Although the population only amounted to250,000 it was a serious matter to allow a Dominion todefault,     since this was calculated to affect Dominionstocks adversely, including m&amp;re particularly those ofCanada.     In the circumstances, he and the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs had taken advantage of Mr.Bennett&apos;s visit to discuss the matter with him, andhad eventually reached an agreement, vdiereby the newfoundland Government would find half the amount due on December 28th, the other half being found jointlyin equal shares by the United Kingdom and Canada.This assistance would take the form of a loan toNewfoundland, but would be accompanied by insistence onthe  appointment of a Commission of three persons toexamine the future of that Dominion.     POr example,one proposal was that Newfoundland might sell Labradorto Canada.     He thought that the future form of Govern-ment of Newfoundland would before long require close attention from the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs.The Cabinet took note of the above statement.

The Cabinet had before them an Interim Reportby the Cabinet Committee on the Hunger Marchers(CP,-434 (32)), the Conclusions and Recommenda-tions of which are summarised in paragraph 11 asfollows:-(ij That before resorting to new legislation further trialshould be given to the pro-cedure by which a Court of summary Jurisdiction may, uponcomplaint, order any person toenter into a recognizance and find sureties to keep the peace or be of good behaviour.(ii) That if this experiment provesunsuccessful the question of strengthening the existing law should be again considered.(iii) That the present Committee shouldbe authorised to proceed with the examination of the existing powers relating to matters such as the importation of funds destined for seditiouspurposes, and communist propa-ganda in the Services.A short discussion revealed that the Cabinetattached considerable importance to Recommendation(iii) above.The Cabinet approved the Interim Reportof the Cabinet Committee  (CP. 434(32)),and the Conclusions and Recommendationsset forth above.
11,    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (CP.-437(32)) on the subject of Meat Prices.   With the concur-rence of the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs and the President of the Board of Trade, the Ministerrecommended that the position should be reviewedforthwith in consultation with Dominion and. foreign interests, with due regard to the provisions of the ottawa Agreements Acts, and he asked that the ministers concerned should, be authorised to negotiate for such further measure of co-operation as may be considered necessary in the light- of expert advice, it being understood that no reductions beyond those already authorised are contemplated.The Cabinet agreed. -(a) To approve the proposals of theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries,as set forth in CP, 437(32) and summarised above:(b) That the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries should be authorised tomake a statement on the subject,after consultation with the Presidentof the Board of Trade as to its terms.
THE TOTALISATOR 12. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by in TOTE CLUBSthe Home Secretary (CP.-439 (32)) on the Use ofAND ON GREY-HOUND RACINGTRACKS .(previous reference:Cabinet 20(32)    Con-conclusion ion 9 .)Totalisators in Tote Clubs and Greyhound RacingTracks .    In this Memorandum the Home secretary reported that a recent Judgment in the High Courtmade it clear that the use of totalisators wasillegal on greyhound racing tracks and, by implications-tion, in Tote Clubs.   As regards Tote Clubs theHome Secretary assumed that the law would be allowedto take its course.   As regards greyhound racingtracks he submitted the following alternatives tothe Cabinet:-(l) To leave the law unaltered, with theresult that in course of time thetotalisator on greyhound racing trackswould be replaced by the bookmaker:(2) To introduce legislation providingfor the use of totalisators ongreyhound racing tracks undersafeguards similar to those nowin force in respect of the use oftotalisators on approved race-courses .After hearing a statement by the Home secretary the Cabinet agreed:-(a) That as regards Tote Clubs the law should be allowed to take its courses(b) That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows:-The Secretary of State for HomeAffairs (In the Chair),The Secretary of State forDominion Affairs,The Secretary of State for Scotland,The Attorney-General,The Lord Advocate,should meet after Christmas, as soon asa report is received from the RoyalCommission on Betting, to considerthe nature of the policy to be adopted as to the use of totalisators onGreyhound Racing Tracks:(c) That the Home Secretary should have discretion, if he thought necessary, to consult the above Committee as towhether any special legislation was   required to prevent evasion ofthe law in respect of Tote Clubs.- 19 -
elusion 13.)and the findings of the Committee were as follows:-JmV (i) That no attempt should be made bythe Government to interfere with messrs Pinchin, Johnson&apos;s lease ofNo.4, Carlton Gardens:(ii) That in view of the fact that no decision has been taken, or willbe taken in the near future, withregard to the future developmentof Carlton House Terrace, thismatter should be deferred pendingthe Cabinet decision on the questionof future Government responsibilityfor the administration of the crown lands:(iii) That, in view of the constitutional and technical considerations involved,the question of future Governmentresponsibility for the administrationof Crown Lands needs further carefuland detailed examination.In the course of the discussion attention was called to a letter signed by a number of Members ofParliament, which appeared in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaperof even date, and it was suggested that arising outof this letter an opportunity might occur for puttingpressure on Messrs Pinchin &amp; Johnson to lower theelevation of the building they are erecting on the site of No.4, Carlton Gardens.    They would, however,be likely to demand compensation and perhaps to askfor accommodation in adjacent buildings.The Cabinet were reminded of the many disadvantagesunder which the buildings in Carlton House Terracesuffered.   Not only is it almost impossible tofind tenants for such inconvenient houses, butstructurally their shell is not strong enough to stand thorough re-conditioning.

This Interim ReportCabinet 67(32), Con- dealt only with the question of Carlton Gardens,
therefore, it was certain that reconstruction wou^Ldhave to take place.    This was not disputed, but washeld by se-me members of the Cabinet to support thearguments in favour of placing the responsibilityfor Crown lands under the control of a Minister whoseDepartment had to deal with building plans on a large scale.    In this connection the Cabinet were informedthat the decision as to No ,4 Carlton Gardens hadbeen taken without consultation with the first commissioner of Works, notwithstanding his responsi-bilities in connection with adjacent public buildings,such as the Admiralty Arch and monuments ,The Cabinet agreed  (a) To authorise the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries to avail himself of anyfavourable opportunity to negotiate with Messrs Pinchin &amp; Johnson for areduction in the height of the new building they are erecting at No,4Carlton Gardens, subject to his obtain-ing the authority of the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer before agreeing to pay compensation.

Extract from a letter from the Private Secretaryto the Prime Minister to the Private Secretary tothe Chancellor of the Exchequer.10, Downing Street,Whitehall, S.W.1.20th December, 1932.&quot;The Prime Minister told me that his ownfeeling was that somebody (either the Ambassador or somebodyin a more private capacity) should at once quite privatelyindicate that we had taken cognisance of the Presidentsmessage to Congress:    that we should like to exchange views as to the time and place when a meeting might take place,and that we should agree that a meeting is urgent.      ThePrime Minister would deprecate going into any details at thisstage as this would merely frighten Hoover, and the President&apos;sadvisers would tell him that he could not accept the proposal of a meeting because conditions were attached to it.     ThePrime Minister was very insistent that the tone and spirit ofthe message should be personal, though there should be no room for doubt that the substance of the message contained theofficial views of His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;
