Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Education (Paper G.T.-7496), a Memorandum bythe Food Controller (Paper G.T.-7499), and a Report of the Sub-Committee of the Liquor Restrictions Committee (Paper G.T.-7527)on the question of an increase in the quantity and an improvementin the quality of beer.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the position sincethe last meeting of the Cabinet was not clear. He understood from the Food Controllers Memorandum that the TechnicalAdvisory Sub-Committee appointed by the Cabinet Committee onLiquor Restrictions were in favour of the abolition of all restric-tions on gravity.   It now appeared that this was not so.Mr. Fisher said that he could only report that, contrary towhat was at first supposed, the majority of the Sub-Committeewere in favour of retaining some control of gravity, though not[826]-749 B
necessarily in favour of the existing arrangement. There were three questions for consideration : (1.) Whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer should surrender13,O0O,000L to the brewers in exchange for anincrease of 30 or 4P of gravity in the quality of beer ;(2.) Whether the existing average gravity should be main-tained ;(3.) Whether all control of gravity should be abolished.-He had come to the conclusion that it was not possible to main-tain the existing average gravity consistently with an improvementin the quality of the beer supplied. After seeing the brewers his impression was that they would do their best, in exchange for there mission of *the proposed 10s. duty, to improve the beer, and thatefforts would be made by the Brewers&apos; Society in that direction, butthey could not give an absolute guarantee.Mr. Bonar Law enquired why a minimum as well as a maximumshould not be introduced in the scale of prices.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the proposal was toraise the minimum and the maximum of each degree. The original proposal had been to raise the gravity 3&quot;. The brewers had taken the point that that was impossible unless the average gravity was raised. The proposal was added to take a lower minimum of under10200 to be sold at 2d. per pint. Mr. Fisher had made the point that if a brewer were brewing at the bottom of any particular scale,e.g., 3d. beer at 10230 (scale 1023o-1029o), and the gravity were raised3D, the public would get 3&quot; benefit, but if he were brewing at the top of the scale he might continue to brew exactly the same beer underthe new grading. According to the brewers, if the increase were 4&quot;instead of 30, it would make it more certain that the benefit of the improved quality would really be obtained.Mr. Bonar Law enquired whether Mr. Fisher was satisfied thatit would be possible to assure the House of Commons that therewould in fact be improved quality.Mr. Fisher said that it would, to a certain extent.Mr. Chamberlain said that the Food Controller, with theconcurrence of the Cabinet, had said that the barrelage would beincreased, and foreshadowed a corresponding additional duty, but nofigure was mentioned.Mr. Roberts said that the original Exchequer estimate of13,000,OOOZ. revenue was the equivalent of 30; 40 was substituted inorder to get over the difficulty of the grades.Mr. Bonar Law said that a leading brewer had told him that -with the existing average gravity it was impossible for brewers tobrew the quantity contemplated.Lord D&apos;Abemou said he did not know the reason for that, butit did not appear to him to be correct. The only difficulties he knew of were in regard to the shortage of barrels and of transport facilities, which were temporary, and were, in fact, the main reasonfor the present shortage.Lord - Milner said that it was very material to bear in mind that the shortage in quantity was the real cause of the presentdiscontent.Mr. Chamberlain said that 10s. per barrel over the whole outputrepresented the additional taxation proposed. Translated intogravity, it was just over 2D ; therefore, when he suggested 30, he wasasking more than 10s., and the 4G suggested by the brewers was nearly double. It was clear that the complaints as to the poor quality of beer were well founded, and they were anxious to meet them, although this would cost more than the 10s. taxation it was proposed to forgo. It was possible that, had the quantity beenpromptly increased, agitation might have been avoided, but at the
present stage he was of opinion that if an attempt were made totake the whole amount of 13,000,OOOL of taxation the Governmentwould be faced with a public opinion which they would be unable tosatisfy; the whole of the additional war revenue derived from beerwould be imperilled. This was a very serious contingency, uponwhich, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, he was bound to lay great stress.As a result of such agitation, the most real part of the liquor control Restrictions, that of hours, would break down. Once the agitation was allowed to gather volume it would extend to thequestion of prices and revenue, and the Government would not beallowed to raise the big revenue they were now receiving, which hadbeen increased from 7s. 9d. per barrel before the war to 70s. A revenuebefore the war of 13,000,0001. had been brought up to very nearly100,000,000Z. In his opinion the main cause of the increase intemperance was due to restricted hours.Lord Milner said that he was not merely arguing from thetemperance point of view he was very much concerned about therevenue, which he thought would be attacked sooner or later.Mr. Roberts said he was prepared to defend the case for takingrevenue through liquor taxation, but any complaints which rested onquantity or gravity of beer would always make a powerful effect upon an audience. He addressed food conferences monthly and hadto meet constant criticism on this ground. The Chancellor of theExchequer would also have to defend the Governments policy in theHouse of Commons.Mr. Fisher said that after his recent interview with the brewershe was left with a very favourable impression of them, and did notthink they wanted to exploit discontent. They seemed to be honestand patriotic men who wanted to co-operate with the Government.He thought that the volume of discontent was caused by the deficiency in quantity. It was also caused by the deficiency in quality, but avery great deal of the deficiency in quality and quantity was in process of being remedied. Gravity had recently been raised from10300 to 10400, and tbe brewers have not yet got their average upto 10400. &apos; They were at present brewing at an average of 10350.In his opinion the working classes were quite content with the beerat 10350 which was being brewed. He felt that the complaintswhich were now heard were the last mutterings of a storm that waspassing away. All the causes of extreme discontent were beingremedied, and at the present date there were no reasons for concessions. He was prepared to agree to releasing all controlof quantity, which would have a useful political effect, thoughit would make no practical difference, as the brewers were not yetable to brew^ tbe full amount, but he was against releasing therestrictions on gravity.Mr. Bonar Law agreed that the discontent was largely clue tocauses that were being remedied, but his information was to theeffect that the agitation was a growing one, and would not benecessarily allayed by the removal of the control of quantity.Dr; Addison said that he had made enquiries in East London and elsewhere, and was informed that the grumblings were much more general on the soore of shortage than anything else. Mr. Fisher&apos;spoint that the effect of raising the gravity was not yet felt, andthat the gravity had not been raised to the full amount, required an answer. It had bad no time to make itself felt, and he did not see any cause for the proposed increase in gravity, except for thepurpose of buying off opposition. If an amount of 13,000,OOOLwere actually obtainable, he could see no reason for giving it up.He would, at any rate, wait to see what happened when the gravityreached 10400.Mr. Chamberlain said that the full benefit of the increasedbarrelage had not been absolutely secured, though the brewers badcome very near it, but the full benefit of the increase in gravity to
10400 had been obtained so far as it would be obtained. the brewers, at the present prices, could not brew to the full amount ofthe average gravity permitted. That was, in fact, the case put by those who argued that you need not have a check on gravity, sincethe effect of prices, combined with taxation and cost of materials,was sufficient.Mr. Fisher agreed with the opinion expressed by Mr. Chamber-lain that the brewers had not found it profitable to brew up to the permitted average of 1040c.Mr. Roberts said it was essential that the public should besatisfied with the quantity of beer supplied. Mr. Tillett had recentlybrought a deputation to him including on it a man whom he hadknown as a temperance advocate. The deputation had insisted that trade Unionists would not drink wash, and Mr. Tillett had threatened to remove his influence that he was at present exercising to prevent them from going on strike. Mr. Roberts was convinced that theGovernment would have to give in. and would have to give improved&apos;quality by refraining from imposing additional taxation. If they didnot do it now they would be forced to do it later.Dr. Addison said that it was not at all clear fromMr. Fisher&apos;s Memorandum that there was any guarantee that the13,000,OOOZ. would be devoted to improving the quality.Mr. Bonar Law said that the real danger was that the wholeof the Chancellor of the Exchequers revenue from beer would be putin jeopardy, through the discontent roused by the addition of extrataxation without any improvement in the quality, and he thoughtthat a public statement that 13,000,000Z. would be devoted to improving the quality of beer would go a long way in allayingdiscontent.The Home Secretary was inclined to agree,Mr. Chamberlain said that it should be borne in mind that hehad increased the duty by 20s. from 50s. to 70s. without any negotiations at all ; that it had been done by a resolution in theHouse of Commons which must be converted into the Bill. Theimposition of a further 10s. would mean another resolution andanother Bill. That would involve concentrating the discontent.Once the public set their face against the taxation they would notstop at 10s. In trying to get the additional 10s. the government might jeopardise the whole revenue and lose the 20s. &quot;which hadalready been imposed.The President of the Board of Education said there was nodoubt the Government were going to encounter a campaign all along the economic field, in view of the high prices which were probable inthe coming winter.Lord d&apos;abernon said that comparative figures of intemperancewere 4,000 a week before the war, 700 a week on the date of thearmistice, and 1,500 a week at the present time. He thought thatthese figures were not really unsatisfactory in view of the increased supplies, the large number of men recently demobilised, and thecontinuance of the unemployment donation, which afforded ample opportunity for drunkenness.Mr. Chamberlain said that Lord d&apos;abernon had previouslypointed out to him that the increase in the supply of whisky had increased drunkenness, whilst the increase in the supply of beerdecreased the rate of intemperance. There was also no doubtthat the fear of shortage of supply caused what was known as&quot; rush &quot; drinking, that is to say, that the public-houses were over-crowded at the beginning of the week by customers who sought todrink all they could while the supply was available.Lord D&apos;Abercorn agreed that shortage of supply carried with it agreat danger of &quot;rush &quot; drinking, but he thought that the danger of shortage of supply was now being overcome. If the Government had13,0O0,O00Z. in hand, it should surely be a powerful lever to secure-
the assent of the Trade to the improvements proposed in the draftBill prepared by the President of the Board of Education.Mr. Bonar Law observed that that only showed the danger ofdealing with the matter piecemeal, and enquired whether it wouldbe worth while to appoint a Select Committee of the House ofCommons in place of the present Liquor Control Committee toconsider future restrictions of the liquor trade.The Food Controller said that he had very little confidence inthe present Committee, which was too much inclined in one direction.The President of the Board of Education said that the central control Board ought not to go on indefinitely and thought that therewas a good deal to be said in favour of appointing a SelectCommittee.Lord Milner asked whether the Government could not refrain from imposing additional taxation and maintain the average gravityat the existing rate ? He thought that there might be formidableopposition if more revenue were taken.Mr. Bonar Law said he would like to spend the money in improving the quality without increasing the average gravity.Th e President of the Board of Education said that he&apos; was convinced that that was impossible.The President of the Local Government Board agreed that theGovernment ought to get something tangible for the 13,000,000/.,and at present he could see no case for increasing the gravity up to20440. From the Parliamentary point of view he agreed that thepossibility of an attack on the whole beer revenue would make avery good case in the House of Commons for not imposing theadditional taxation.Lord Milner said that he would leave the gravity unchangedeven if no taxation were imposed. He would prefer to get nothing for the 13,000,000Z. rather than to get something bad for it.The President of the Local Government Board said it was a mistake to suppose that the whole unpopularity for the beer shortagewas falling on the Government. The brewers were even moreunpopular.The Home Secretary said that that was not the case in thenorth of England.The President ofthe Board of Education said that he had hadan exchange of views with some leading brewers and found that theywere thinking very much on the lines of the draft Bill. The moment was opportune for substantial reform.The President of the Local Government Board suggested thatMr. Fisher should be empowered to negotiate with the brewers onthe lines of his draft Bill.Mr. Bonar Law said it was no use trying to negotiate on thequestion of restricted hours. That the Government must settle for for themselves.Lord D&apos;Abernon said that he would like to tie the brewersdown on the question of hours if it were possible. While they mightnot readily assent to them, they would acquiesce in the Govern-menfs decision.Mr. Chamberlain said that he thought the Trade were in a veryreasonable frame of mind. There was a constant rumble of discontentin the country of which they were very much afraid, and they were very anxious for a settlement.The Food Controller agreed. When the Ministry of Food firstapproached them,.they did not object to the further increase of 10s.taxation and were alarmed at the state of public opinion.Mr. Bonar Law said that he favoured a Select Committee of theHouse of Commons, partly on the ground that there was constant pressure in the House of Commons to remove restrictions on clubs,and support of a Select Committee in maintaining restrictions allround would be valuable.[826]-749 C
In reply to a question by Mr. Chamberlain, there was generalagreement that restrictions on the quantity of beer permitted to bebrewed should be removed.Mr. Chamberlain continued that the whole question was,therefore, whether the gravity should also be increased, and whetherthe Government should make any announcement of further taxationuntil they had an understanding with, the brewers in regard to prices and gravity. If it were possible to approach the brewers in afew days with the terms of a Bill for the reform of the trade, hewould have no objection, but it was impossible to wait for several weeks.Mr. Fisher said that, in his opinion, the brewers would beready to agree to the following : (1.) A new statutory body to take the place of the liquor control Board, with a Minister at the head of itresponsible to Parliament.(2.) The continuance of restricted hours.(3.) The continuance of restrictions on credit sales.(4.) The continued application of restrictions to clubs.(5.) Reform of the basis of the License Duty, in order toencourage the improvement of premises. (The presentsystem put a premium on selling the largest amount of beer in the smallest space.)(6.) Encouragement to sell food and non-intoxicating drink.(7.) Stipendiary Justices in place of Licensing Justices, and alarger area for licensing.The brewers were not prepared to admit that there was an excessive number of public-houses in the country, but said that they. were ill distributed, and that there was a great redundancy incertain places.     They particularly urged that the  Governmentshould not introduce a Bill without consulting them.Mr. Bonar Law thought that there was nothing in theseproposals that could not be obtained in the House of Commonswithout the previous agreement of the brewers. He did not seeanything on which a bargain could be usefully concluded with the brewers in the points put forward by Mr. Fisher.The President of the Local Government Board hoped that,before an announcement was made, the Cabinet would be informed ifthe trade were likely to oppose. He felt that all the Governmentwere getting in return for giving up their 13,000,0001. wereuncontrolled quantity, a rise in gravity, and a vague promise on thepart of the brewers that they would do their best to improve thelower grades of beer.Mr. Chamberlain said that, in his opinion, the- 13,00O,000Z.would never materialise. It was important that the Cabinet shouldremember that the original proposal upon which the Budget was founded was for a barrelage of 20,000,000, which was subsequentlychanged, at the direction of the Cabinet, under the pressure ofpublic opinion, to 26,000,000. The public had accepted theadditional 20s. taxation, but he was sure that they would not continue to acquiesce in further taxation. He wished to point outthat a barrelage of 20,000,000 with an average gravity of 10400 hadbeen agreed to by a Treasury Committee as a compromise. At therequest of Lord Milner the Committee had added that, should theCabinet increase the barrelage hereafter, that would be a reason for increasing the tax.The President of the Board of Education said that they were bound to accept the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s view that itwould be very difficult at this juncture to impose the extra 10s. duty.The alternatives before the Cabinet were, therefore : (1.Y To do nothing.(2.) To get something from the brewers in increased quality by increasing the gravity.
He did not think there was any serious risk to temperance in granting 3Q an increase of three degrees could only just be appreciated. He was very much against releasing control ofgravity altogether, and if any concession were made the Governmentshould take advantage of it to bring forward a Bill for improving the conditions of the trade, and should so inform the brewers.Mr. Bonar Law enquired whether an addition to the duty of5s. instead of 10s. would be desirable in order to placate the brewersby not taxing to the full amount expected.Lord D&apos;Abernon said that there was great danger of arousingpopular irritation by thus enhancing brewery shares on the stock exchange.Mr. Bonar Law agreed and said that there was also the dangerof a campaign against profiteering.Mr. Chamberlain said that he would have preferred to allocate the 13 millions to decreasing the price, but the amount was too small to show effect in the retail price. There was the additionaldanger that if the Government did not take the 13 millions thecry would be raised by the public that the consumer should have the extra profit.The President of the Board of Education suggested that, inview of the difficulties which the Chancellor felt in imposing freshtaxation, an announcement should be made that control overquantity should be removed, that the gravity would be increasedby 3D all along the line, that there would be no additional taxation,and that the Government were preparing a measure which would ensure that the ground gained for temperance during the war wasnot lost by the ill-considered removal of reasonable restrictions.Mr. Bonar Law said he believed that a simple announcement that control.over quantity would be removed and quality would be improved would have enormous effect.Mr. Chamberlain said that he did not think the case oftemperance would be the least affected by the increase of gravity.The increase of gravity from 10400 to 10440 would not cause one case of drunkenness in 1,000.Lord D&apos;Abernon said that he would agree to the increase of4Q if that were to be the end, but the Government had kept on increasing the gravity.Mr. Chamberlain said that if it were desired to maintain gravityat a low level the proper thing would be to forbid brewing above acertain gravity altogether, but that meant abolishing well-knownspecial brands Bass, Guinness, and London Stout. That was theonly way to make the system of average gravity work with fairnessand consistency.Mr. Bonar Law said he did not think the Government would face such a proposal. He would propose to the brewers that theymust either improve their quality by 40 or submit to the 10s. extraduty. &apos; &apos;The Food Controller pointed out that the answer to that was thatit was differentiating in favour of the brewers who brewed high gravitybeer. The addition of 40 to the average gravity would favour thehigh-gravity brewers because it would enable them to brew largerproportions of their own special brands.The President of the Board of Education observed that in hisopinion the brewers had made out a case that with the averagegravity at 10400 thej&apos; could not give the consumer of industrialbeer 13,000,O00Z. in additional gravity.Mr. Chamberlain observed that if the brewers were asked tobrew at an average gravity of 10400, and to increase the gravity cfall grades by 3D up to the 7cL. beer, they would say they could not do it,and that a 10s. additional duty would be cheaper for them. In theresult there would be a violent outcry.The President of the Board of Education said that he had putthat proposal, and after two hours&apos; discussion had come away withthe view that it was impossible.
Mr. Bonar Law said that reduced the proposition to two alternatives to raise the gravity to 104&apos;4o or to do nothing.Lord Milner said of the two he preferred to do nothing.The Home Secretary said that, in his opinion, the question of quality was not quite so important as quantity, but very nearly so.The Food Controller said that the opinion had been forced upon him, when he was Minister of Labour, that the restrictions onbrewing were only defensible so long as the war was going on, andnot for a moment longer. He was not prepared to resort tounderhand devices to obtain the execution of a temperance policy,which should be openly declared and defended.Mr. Fisher said that when the Chancellor of the Exchequermade his announcement he should make it clear that the Govern-ment intended to introduce a Bill defining their policy in regard toliquor control.Subject to the Prime Ministers consent, the War cabinet decided that  x(a.) All restrictions should be removed as to the quantity of beer which might be brewed.(6.) The gravity of beer in each grade should be increased by40, and the permitted average gravity of the output ofany brewer should be raised by a like amount,(c.) The price of beer of a gravity under  10200 should be2d. per pint.(d.) In announcing (a) above, the F^ood Controller should statethat the amount which the Government had proposed toraise in additional taxation to cover the increased rate of profit arising out of a larger output of beer would be spent in improving the quality of beer supplied to thepublic.(e.) A simultaneous announcement should be made of theGovernments intention to introduce this Session a bill dealing with the question of a Central Liquor Authority,restriction of hours, and general licensing conditions.(The Secretary of State for the Colonies ^ and the President of theLocal Government Board desired to record their dissent fromthe decision in paragraph (b) of the foregoing.) &apos;2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,June 23, 1919.o
