Evans, Assistant Secretary.The Case of Miss 1. Mr. Bonar Law said that the House of Lords had decided inDouglas-Pennant. favour of the enquiry asked for by Miss Douglas-Pennant. It was now for the Government to decide (l) whether they would grantsuch an enquiry, and (2), if they refused an enquiry, what should be their attitude to the House of Lords should they decide to conductan enquiry itself by means of a Select Committee ? He thought hewas correct in saying that either House was entitled to set up a select Committee and to call evidence, but he did not think thatthere was power in such cases to call for evidence on oath.[826]-698 B
The Acting-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theHouse of Lords asked for a judicial enquiry, he supposed before oneor two judges, and evidence taken on oath. The point of view ofthe blouse of Lords was that, by the recent publication of certainletters by Miss Douglas-Pennant, an entirely new complexion hadbeen placed upon the case, inasmuch as charges of a serious characterwere made. In addition to this, a pledge had been given by theSecretary of State for War that, if a primd facie case for an enquirycould be made out, the Government would set one up. It wascontended that the publication of these letters constituted a sufficient reason for an enquiry.The Secretary of State for War said that he did not agree thata primd facie case had in fact been made out. When he had firstentertained the idea of an enquiry, he had been told that MissDoup-las-Pennant had alleged that she was dismissed because sherefused (1) to overlook immoral practices said to be rife in the force,and (2) to become a party to a corrupt clothing contract. these would have been sufficient reasons, but these allegations did notappear in any of her documents. It woxdd, in his opinion, not be justifiable to have an investigation into her charge that she hadbeen obstructed in her work. He had studied the whole matter very carefully, and could not agree to the Government supporting the House of Lords in this matter.Lord Curzon thought that, while no obstacle should be placed inthe way of the House of Lords holding an enquiry if they so desired,it should also be made clear that the Government could not recedefrom the position they had taken up in the House of Commons onthis question.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that if the Governmentbecame in any way a party to the House of Lords enquiry, theywould be bound to provide their public servants, who, in the Govern-menfs opinion, had been attacked unjustly, with legal opportunities of defending themselves. This would be a costly proceeding. Inhis opinion it should be represented to the House of Lords that theGovernment considered that wholly insufficient reasons for such an enquiry had been made out, and that the Government was neitherjustified in incurring the expense which would be entailed nor insetting up a bad precedent.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he felt very strongly that if the House of Lords enquiry was endorsed by the Govern-ment, it would be striking a blow at the beads of departments. this had been the subject of an important debate in the House ofCommons, and the policy adopted by the Secretary of State for war had not been challenged in that House. Tf every case in whichallegations were made against the members of the Government wasto be investigated there would be no end to them.Lord Curzon said that the points which influenced the Houseof Lords in this matter were three : -(1.) That Mr. Harmsworth had conducted an investigation and reported in favour of a Judicial Enquiry ;(2.) That on two occasions when this matter came up, LordWeir, although in this country, was absent from theHouse ;(3.) The specific pledges given in the House of Commons thatif a primd facie case was made out an Enquiry would begranted.The whole case really turned on whether a primd facie case hadbeen made out for malice and corruption.The Secretary of State for War then read to the Cabinet his last letter to Miss Douglas-Pennant.Some discussion then took place as to whether it would bedesirable to publish the Report of Mr. Harrhsworth&apos;s Enquiry, but
Mr. Harmsworth stated that if this course was contemplated hewould have first to obtain permission from several people who were involved. He had recommended a Judicial Enquiry for the reason that Miss Douglas-Pennant had made allegations against DameKatherine Purse and others, which he felt were of such a characterthat he was not competent to decide upon them. He did not thinkthat an Enquiry, if held, would last more than a very few days.It was generally agreed that to publish a Confidential report made to a Minister would form a bad precedent, and that to publish a summary of it would be viewed with suspicion and would not satisfy those who were clamouring for the whole Report.Lord Curzon said that, in his opinion, the best way to treat thematter was for the Government to support the Secretary of Statefor War in his contention that no case had been made out for a judicial Enquiry, and that Mr. Bonar Law should answer to this effect in the House of Commons ; then, when the House of Lordsmet again, he (Lord Curzon) could inform them of this fact and saythat any action taken by them must be on their own account, andhe would add that, in his opinion, it would be unwise of their lordships to take independent action.Mr. Bonar Law then read out the following question, which wasto be asked in the House of Commons that afternoon, and the answerhe proposed to give :  &quot; Sir E. Thomas.-To ask the Leader of the House whetherthe Government are now prepared, in view of what occurred in another place last week, to agree to set up a full judicial enquiry in respect of Miss Douglas-Pennanfs dismissal.&quot;&quot; Answer. The Government have given most carefulconsideration to the opinion expressed by the House of Lordsthat a judicial enquiry should be held into the circumstances inwhich the Hon. Violet Douglas-Pennant was removed from herappointment under the Air Ministry in August of last year.The responsibility of instituting such an enquiry must rest uponthe Government. It would involve a large expenditure ofpublic money, it would be contrary to the general principles of departmental administration, and it would establish a very unde-undesirable precedent, for if an enquiry were agreed to in regard to thislady, who is not only greatly respected but has great personaliufluence, it would be difficult to justify the refusal to take a similarcourse in the case of many others who are not in an equallyinfluential position. In these circumstances His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have decided that it would not be right for them toset up this tribunal.&quot;Lord Curzon said that he agreed with the proposed answer, inprinciple, but suggested that the wording should be slightly altered.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To approve the proposed -answer by Mr. Bouar Law in theHouse of Commons that afternoon, but that the wordingshould be agreed upon between Mr. Bonar Law and the acting-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs ;(b.) To refuse to publish Mr. Harmsworth&apos;s Report.Salaries of 2. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum byScientific and the president of the Board of Education (Paper G.T.-7108) containingTechnical Officers. a pr0p0Sai t^at) jn v^ew 0f tp,g increasecl number of scientific andtechnical officers who would be brought into Government service bythe establishment of the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Supply,and tiie Ministry of Ways and Communications, and in view of theco-ordination of the general scientific work of the Government underthe Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the whole[826]-698 B 2
question of the salaries and conditions of service of such officers should be reviewed by a strong Committee consisting mainly of menof standing in the scientific and possibly also in the business world,together with one or two civil servants or ex-civil servants, whowould be able to assist the Committee to relate their proposals tothe existing practice of the Government as regards their services,together with memoranda on the same subject by the First Lord ofthe Admiralty (Paper G.T.-7156), the Secretary of State for War(Paper G.T.-719L), the Minister of Munitions (Paper G.T.-7231),Sir Eric Geddes (Paper G.T.-7258), the Postmaster-General (paper g.T.-7339), and the Under-Secretary of State for Air (paper g.T.-7350).The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded Mr. Bonar Law thatwhen, twelve months before, this proposal had been put forward, hehad disagreed with it, and he (Mr. Chamberlain) was still of theopinion which Mr. Bonar Law held at that time. The whole positionof money values and wages was too uncertain to make it desirableto fix permanent &quot;scales of salary at the present time. Scientific men,however, had the idea that this was their opportunity to press on theGovernment their claims fur large salaries. That was the chiefreason wliy he deprecated the appointment of the Committee sug-gested by Mr. Fisher. His own opinion was that there should be nodifficulty in obtaining a sufficient number of competent men at thescale of salaries and war bonus offered by the Government. In fact,many efficient men were taking other appointments which were nobetter paid than Government posts. Replying to Mr. Bonar Law,Mr. Chamberlain admitted that there was a certain demand in business circles for scientific men, but this demand was for men of high specialist qualifications. If it were decided to appoint thethe Committee, he hoped that it would not be composed so largelyof scientific men as was suggested.The Postmaster-General said that salaries throughout Govern-ment Departments for the higher grades were very low. Themaximum salary of the head engineer at the Post Office, who had under him 20,000 men, was in charge of plant of the value of30,000,0007., and was resiDonsible for the purchase of goods to perhapsabout 2,0 0 0,00 07,, was &apos; 1,2007, a-year. In his (Mr. i Ring worth&apos;s)opinion the whole question of the salaries of the higher Civil Servantsshould be taken in hand, and large increases made. Scientific men inparticular should have good commencing salaries; they would not take Government posts when they could obtain better paidpositions in Industrial firms.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that the war had given an enormous impetus to scientific research. In the Navy, inparticular, a number of experiments were in process of beingcarried out, and a decision on the question of salary was essential ifthe Admiralty were to retain their best research workers. Thequestion would arise in Parliament on the Naval Estimates, and he felt certain that the Admiralty would be pressed to give assurances that research was being properly carried out. The Controller of the research Department had informed him that he was losing mendaily on account of the uncertainty as to the provision of adequatesalaries.Mr. Bonar Law said that the appointment of the proposed committee would make it impossible to confine the enquiry tothe salaries of technical and scientific officers. The alternative was that the Treasury should be prepared to treat more generouslythan they had done before particular men of high attainments.The Under-Secretary of State lor Air said that, the matter was urgent from the point of view of the Air Force al-o. Theprogress of research in aerial matters tended to save life, and ifthe Government omitted to provide adequate salaries they would .only be able to obtain second- or thirds-rate officers for theirresearch work.
5WC 576.The Minister of Munitions instanced the case of the GeneralElectrical Company, who were taking selected University men fromthe army and paying them 201. a month during training over aperiod of eighteen months, and appointing them, if they provedefficient at the end of that time, to posts carrying salaries of1,000Z. a year.The President of the Board of Education said that in futurethere would he a large number of Departments employing manyscientific and technical men. He agreed there was a great deal inthe argument that it would be preferable to fix permanent scales of salary for such men in twelve months&apos; time; but something shouldbe done to meet the present situation. Neither the Treasury northe Departments concerned were able to judge of the value of a man who might, perhaps, have specialist qualifications for which therewas a great demand in industry and a very restricted supply. If itwas not possible to appoint a Committee such as he had proposed,he would like to suggest that a temporary Committee of theTreasury should be set up to go, wdth the Departments concerned,into the question of the salaries to be offered to scientific andtechnical officers, and to make some provisional arrangementspending more normal conditions.The first Lord of the Admiralty and the Under-Secretary olState for Air supported this proposal.Lord Curzon said that this question was continually before him as Lord President of the Council and Chairman of the Council ofthe Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Should theCabinet decide to appoint a Committee, he was strongly of theopinion that it should consist mainly not of men of science, but of men of affairs. The term &quot; scientist&quot; was very elastic, and claims would arise for the revision of the salaries of men in all branches of the service. He agreed with the President of theBoard of Education that there were a number of very competentmen whom it would be bad policy not to keep in the government service, but he felt that each Department should bring its own cases to the Treasury to be decided on their merits.The War Cabinet decided that The Chancellor of the Exchequer should set up a temporaryCommittee to examine, in consultation with the Depart-ments concerned, the question of the salaries to be offered to scientific and technical officers whom it was desired to employ in the Government service.Lord French&apos;s 3. The War Cabinet considered what replies should be given inBook. the House of Commons to the following questions : Questions in (1.) Whether Field-Marshal Lord French has published variousParliament. confidential documents which he learned of in his officialcapacity, including his original instructions from Field-Marshal Lord Kitchener and a Memorandum which headdressed to the War Cabinet; and, if so, what action itwas proposed to take.(2.) Whether tiie report by Lord Kitchener, on the supply ofshrapnel and high explosive shells in September and october 19 L4, can be issued as a Parliamentary Paper.The Secretary of State for War said that, in ins opinion, theGovernment should reply to all such questions to the effect that, inview of the partial disclosures in various quarters, (he government proposed to table a Blue Book containing all the relevant documentsbearing on the question of the supply of ammunition to the armies in the field in the early part of the war.    He would go further, and
announce that the Government, after the signing of peace, wouldpublish a series of Parliamentary Papers which would give the storyof the great episodes of the war to the public in an authentic form.The various documents would be edited as the public interestdemanded, but the Government would take responsibility for giving a fair, full, and representative account of the events that had takenplace. Mr. Churchill added that one of the main advantages ofsuch a course would be that historians would have authenticdocuments on which to base their narratives. He had talked thismatter over with the Prime Minister, who had approved thesuggestion, and had said that he would very much like to havepublished an authentic account of the munitions crisis.The First Lord said that he bad discussed the matter with hisNaval Advisers, who were all of the opinion that any attempt to publish all the papers connected with the War would inevitablystrike a serious blow at Staff work and administration. It wasimpossible to call upon men to defend every decision taken at amoments notice and in the heat of conflict. The Admiralty were,however, preparing a record of the events of the War, although theycould not agree to the publication of the secret documents.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Secretary of State for War should reply to theQuestion concerning the publication by Lord Frenchof confidential documents on the following lines : &quot; I have now had the articles referred to examined in the War Office. The publication of certain of these documents was unauthorised. On the other band, hadpermission been sought it is probable that it wouldhave been accorded, as publication of none of these documents is in any way detrimental to the publicinterest. The whole subject is now in the region ofpublic controversy, and I do not contemplate anyspecial action in regard to it.&quot;(b.) He should reply to the Question regarding the publicationof Lord Kitcheners report on shells, in the sense thatthe Government were not prepared to publish anydocuments giving a partial or one-sided view of the events of the War. i(c.) He should add that the Government had under considera-tion the question of the more general publication, at alater stage, of official documents bearing on the events of the War.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,June 4, 1919.
