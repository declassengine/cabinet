The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Food Controller (Paper G.T.-7175) on the demobilisation ofthe Ministry of Food, in which it was pointed out that there were three alternative courses for decision : (a.) As to whether the policy of demobilising the Ministry ofFood indicated in the Memorandum should be carriedout, and the most suitable date to aim at for thetermination of the Ministry;(6.) As to &quot;whether any single Department should be givencontinuing responsibility for food questions generally,and, if so, which Department;(c.) If the alternative of splitting up the permanent measuresof control were preferred, which Departments should undertake the various iteras.[820-607]The future of food control.
The War Cabinet also had before them a letter from theSecretary of the Consumers&apos; Council (Paper GT.-7132) urging thecontinuance of the Ministry of Food, with extended powers.The Food Controller stated that the matter was urgent, owingto the consideration of the question in the House of Commons onthe following day. An amendment would be moved by Mr. Clynes,on behalf of the Labour Party, at the instigation of the Consumers&apos;Council, to reduce the vote for the Ministry of Food in order to urge the necessity for retaining the Ministry as a permanent institution.The amendment was supported by the Executive of the LabourParty and the Parliamentary Labour Party.    He had understoodthat it was his business to close down the Ministry as rapidly aspossible, and he had carried out a policy of decontrol as quickly as was consistent with the interests of consumers.   He understood that,in so doing, he was carrying out the policy of Mr. Clynes, which hehad formulated up to the time of his resignation.   By the end ofJune control would be substantially reduced, and from that time ondecontrol would he very rapid, and, in his opinion, by the end ofNovember there would not be sufficient work to justify the existenceof a separate Department with a large administrative stalk   Theproposal of the Consumers&apos; Council was to retain the Ministry and give it much more extended powers : for example, they proposedthat a newly constituted Ministry of Food should have charge of thewhole of the work of extending home production.   In the view ofthe Ministry, there were certain powers which were being exercisedand oertrn experience which had been accumulated, which shouldnot be dissipated  and   should be taken advantage  of by theappropriate Departments.    For. instance, it was suggested thatthere should be permanent control over milk, under the Ministry ofHealth, and that the control of liquor should go to the Home Office.He suggested that in Clause 4 of the Ministry of Supply Bill therewere powers which would enable that Department, when constituted,to undertake control of food supplies.   He required immediateguidance for the purpose of the discussion  in the  House ofCommons on the following day, when he would have to make astatement as to the future of the Ministry.   He suggested that anundertaking might be given that, before the Ministry actually came to an end, the whole matter would be reviewed in the light of past and present experience.   The Consumers&apos; Council was created byMr. Clynes, at the suggestion of Lord Rhondda ;  it had filleda useful purpose, but had frequently proved to be an embarrassment.It threatened to work up a very large agitation against the proposalto terminate the Ministry.   It was an advisory body, of a not veryrepresentative character, containing too many theorists.   He wasnominally Chairman, in succession to Mr. Clynes.   It was probablethat, as a matter of expediency, the Labour Party would find itnecessary to support the Consumers&apos; Council.   The Co-operative societies were also very, anxious to preserve control, as they had made progress under it.   Undoubtedly by far the greatest body ofopinion in the House of Commons was in favour of abolishing allcontrol.   Of that there could be no question.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there were threedistinct issues: (a.) Was food to be controlled as during the war?If so, it could only be done effectively by means of a thoroughsystem of control of prices, control of distribution, and purchasedraw materials. In his view there was no question that that form of complete control must be brought to an end. There was no question as to the view the House of Commons would take if it were necessaryto continue a large body of officials, and even increase their number,in order to continue control, (b.) There were a certain number oi:minor controls which were bound up with questions of policy nowbeing considered by the Cabinet; for example, the question of the liquor trade, in which it was not yet possible to say what shape that control would take,   (c.) Provision must also be made for a more
efficient control of the same kind as that exercised by the Board ofTrade and the Local (fovennnent Board before the war ; for example,the prevention of adulteration, and similar matters. At the momentit was not necessary to specify the subjects which would hecontrolled, or how the control would be exercised, lie thought, itshould bo stated definitely that control as we had known it duringthe war, was only possible on the most extensive scale, and that theGovernment did not mean to attempt it.Lord Ourzon stated that an answer in the negative was the only possible answer to Mr. dynes&apos; proposal. The Government were committed to it by their policy during the last two years. It hadbeen frequently announced that control would be abolished on thetermination of the war, and he viewed with great alarm the kind of extension foreshadowed by the Consumers&apos; Council. He hoped that nothing would be said in the House of Commons debate to suggestthat the present Ministry of Food, or anything like it on a larger scale, would be made a permanency.Mr. Fisher expressed his agreement.The President of the Local Government Board stated that: he also agreed, and said that the point as to how profiteering was to hedealt with would have to be met. The only possible answer wasthat, if prices were controlled, production and distribution must alsobe controlled, and that the Government would not undertake.The Food Controller said that he proposed to show that control,could not be partial, and that enormous staffs were necessarythroughout the country. Half of the expense of the Ministry Avas onaccount of local committees. These committees could no longer bekept together on their presont basis. The men composing thembelonged to municipalities and business firms, and could no longer be spared. Consequently the maintenance of the stall would involvethe creation of a huge new Ministry.The Minister of Supply said, in reference to Mr. Roberta&apos;suggestion, that the Ministry of Supply should undertake food control, that such was not the intention of the Bill setting tip theMinistry of Supply. It was merely to be a Government Departmentbuying materials for other Government Departments, and not for thesupply of the public.Sir William Beveridge said that until quite recently decontrolhad been going very smoothly, and had invariably led to a reduction* in prices ; but a tendency the other way had now set in, possiblyowing to purchases on German and Austrian account, particularlyin the matter of bacon and oil-seeds.Sir Auckland Geddes said that the point raised by Sir william beveridge was of great importance. We were faced with a profound. change that might affect the whole world markets in food and rawmaterial. There would be for a short time great stringency in supplies, owing to the Central European demands that was the one point to be borne in mind. It might be wise for Mr. Roberts tostate quite clearly in the House of Commons that such a dangerexisted, and that all control would not be removed until the danger was passed.The War Cabinet decided :  (a.) To approve of the statement Mr. Roberts proposed to makein the House of Commons, that the Ministry of food would be demobilised as soon as the need for controlcame to an end ;(6.) That the subsidiary questions referred to in theMemorandum by the Ministry of Food, including thepermanent measures of control of certain articles, shouldbe referred to the Home Affairs Committee, to determine&quot; by which Department or Departments they should tieundertaken, viz., milk control, liquor control, nationalkitchens, farina mills, investigation and records of prices,

The Acting President of the Board of Trade said that theCommittee under his Chairmanship, which the War Cabinet had appointed on the 14th April (War Cabinet 55fi, Minute .1) to examinethe drafting of the Electricity Supply Bill, had completed their work, and the Bill was now ready for introduction to Parliament.He understood that the Home Secretary would be in charge of theBill.The War Cabinet decided : To sanction the introduction of the Bill in Parliament.Unemployment ^ With re;erence to War Cabinet 554, Minute 2, the WarDonation.
