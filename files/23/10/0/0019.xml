Lord Inverforth, Ministerof Munitions.Colonel L. C. M. S. Amery, M.P., Parliamentary Under-Secretary, Colonial Office.Mr. Thomas Jones, Acting Secretary.Captain L. F. Buegis, Assistant Secretary.Mr. G. M. Evans, Assistant Secretary.Oilfields of Papua. 1. With reference to War Cabinet 518, Minute 2, the War cabinet had under consideration a memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (Paper G.T.-7235), and a memorandum by the FirstLord of the Admiralty (Paper G.T. 7234), on the question of theproposal that the British and Australian Governments should eachprovide 50,000?. for- the purpose of conducting experiments intothe oil resources of Papua.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the great objectionhe had to the scheme was that, at a time when our capital resources were so small and the demands upon these resources so heavy, wewere asked to provide money for something we had never beforeclone, namely, to assist one of the self-governing dominions todevelop its own resources. Apart from any other objectiou,it would provide a bad precedent, and the government might be overwhelmed with requests to participate in numbersof similar undertakings. He had put that view before the WarCabinet when the question was previously discussed, but it had then been decided to enter into a joint undertaking with theAustralian Government, provided a scheme was put forward forcarrying it out which was a practical business proposition. Theonly scheme which had been advanced up to the present was a verysketchy one.The First Lord of the Admiralty remarked that Sir JosephCook had said that the Australian Government would be preparedto meet all the difficulties of the Treasury ; they merely desired thatwe should share equally in the undertaking. His own opinion wasthat there were great potential advantages for this country as wellas for Australia in the proposition. Whatever might be the futureof the Australian Navy, there was no doubt that Great Britain would[8261-678
2continue to have commitments in the Pacific, and, in view of the increasing- tendency of warships to depend upon oil for their fuel,it would be an immense gain if this oil were ready to hand inPapua, and we were thus saved the necessity of carrying it fromafar. Mr. Long added that he thought we were actually committed to the enterprise and certainly the Australian Government were ofthat opinion.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed, that any greatdevelopment of the oilfields in Papua would be of advantage to thewhole Empire, particularly from the naval point of view. At themoment, however, he had in view not the question of principle, butthe actual scheme which had been put forward. At present itmerely amounted to an agreement as between this country and australia for equal participation in expenses and results ; but therewas no scheme for the working of the wells bhould the resxdts of the experiments justify our going forward. He was afraid that the peculiar position of Australia as regards labour might make any scheme of development expensive to carry out, and that theAustralian Government might have to give away in the cost oflabour all profits that might accrue-a thing which we could not afford to do. On mentioning this to Sir Joseph Cook, however, thelatter had informed him that the law prohibiting the employmentof coloured labour operated in Australian territory only, so that that difficulty did not arise. Sir Joseph Cook had also said, in reply tothe Chancellors fear that the Government might be committednot merely to developing the oilfields, but also to working them and marketing their produce at some future date, that, whilst publicopinion in Australia would not allow the cession of these natural resources now to private concerns, there would not be the sameobjection to their being worked by companies under proper control, if that course was thought desirable later. Mr. Chamberlain went on tosay that Sir Joseph Cook&apos;s assurance had done something to meet his views; besides, the matter had gone so far that it would be difficult for the Imperial Government to withdraw now. Bat he hoped that,if the War Cabinet agreed to the proposal to provide the sum askedfor, the Colonial Office would clearly understand that it was not tobe taken as a precedent in the case of claims for help in similarundertakings.The Under-Secretary of State for&apos; the Colonies pointed out thatone reason why the Government should approve the present proposal was that the Prime Minister and Lord Milner, in negotiations withMr. Hughes, had been discussing a somewhat similar under-taking in connection with the island of Nauru, by which com-missioners would be appointed to&apos; superintend the working ofphosphates under the Australian and New Zealand Governments.One of the conditions of that scheme was that the governments should not interfere in labour matters, and a similar conditionmight be inserted in the Papua scheme.The Minister of Munitions expressed the opinion that 100,000i.would not be sufficient even to complete the experiments and to prove if oil were there in sufficient quantities.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that the question had been exhaustively examined by the Petroleum Executive allthe members of which were experts and the opinion had beenreached, after a most careful examination, that 100,U00Z. would besufficient for the purpose. A great deal of the preliminary work had already been accomplished, and the question now arose as towhether the State or private companies should continue the work.Mr. Long added that he would like the War Cabinet to considerthe question of continuing the Petroleum Executive as a permanentdepartment to control and develop the oil supplies of the Empire.His own opinion was that it should be made a permanent department under the Ministry of Supplies.Mr. Bonar Law observed that this question had been brought
2. The. Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies said thatduring the last three months General Botha had been pressing thePrime Minister and Lord Milner that some return should be madefor the services renaered to the Empire by the South Africanrailways during the war, services which included the provision ofmany hundreds of miles of rails for the campaigns in Africa, and thefree transport over their lines of material and personnel (includingLabour Units) necessary for the campaigns of the Imperial Govern-ment; services, as a consequence of which the South african government were without rails and equipment for their immediateneeds. lie (Mr. Amery) had gone very carefully with LordInverforth into the claims of the South African Government, and had come to the conclusion that, apart from the rails supplied to South-West Africa which would come back to the Union, the only seriousitem in those claims was that for the free carriage of Imperialtroops, and that, in this respect, the South African estimate of one and a half millions up to March 1918, plus a corresponding additionfor the rest of the war, was very excessive. It had been suggestedby the South African Government that the matter should be settled by supplying them with surplus railway material now held by theImperial Government, from the cost of which should be deductedthe value of the services rendered by the South African railways.Lord Inverforth and representatives of his Department had, however,considered that there were great difficulties in the way of offeringthis material to the South African railways at a special price, and ithad been decided that it would be preferable to meet our obligationby offering the South African Government second-class rails whichhad been used in Prance. He (Mr. Amery) had therefore tentativelysuggested to General Botha that the Imperial Government mightbe prepared to offer the Government of South Africa these railsup to the value of 500,000Z. General Botha, who appeared tothink this was a definite offer, had informed his colleagues inSouth Africa of the fact, and a telegram had been received that day in London to the effect that Mr. Burton had, amid greatenthusiasm, announced in the House of Assembly the decision ofthe Imperial Government to give the Union Government railwaymaterials to the value of 50O,0OOL for national service rendered.In these circumstances he (Mr. Amery) thought it right that theWar Cabinet should be made aware of what had happened.The War Cabinet took note of the statement made by the under-Secretary of State for the Colonies.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. L,Maij 28, 1919.oforward some time previously but had been postponed for later consideration, and it bad better await the passing of the Ministry ofSupply Bill.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, referring to Lord Inverforth&apos;scontention that 100,000Z. would not be sufficient to carry out the experiments, said that one of the clauses of the agreement was thatthe liability of each Government was to be strictly limitedto 50,0007,The War Cabinet decided (a.) To reaffirm their previous decision to share equally withthe Australian Government an expenditure of 100,OOOZ.for conducting experiments into the oil resources ofPapua.(6.) That the Petroleum Executive should formulate a practicablescheme for executing the work on business lines.
