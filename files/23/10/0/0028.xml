Decentralisation of 1. With reference to War Cabinet 578, Minute 3, the Warthe Ministry of Cabinet took note of a   Memorandum  by   Lord   Milner   (Paper-Pensions. G,T.-7484).in which he said that he bad read the papers regardingthe proposed temporary occupation of school premises in AlbanyRoad, Cardiff, for the&apos; use of the Pensions Ministry regional headquarters Staff, and had come to the conclusion that theproposed occupation could not be justified.Supply of Beer. 2. With reference to War Cabinet 577, Minute 3, Mr. bonar law said he did not think it had been made clear in publicannouncements that, although the baiTelage of beer was restricted to 26,000,000 standard barrels, that was in practice as much as the brewers could brew. He was convinced that a large part of the unrest in the country was due to the feeling that the government did not allow sufficient beer to be brewed ; and he thought that all restrictions on quantity should be removed. He had been informedthat there had been a considerable idse in the price of barley, whichthe brewers would use as an argument against further taxation.\ The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had received fromBirmingham an anonymous letter, signed by a, man who calledhimself &quot; A Shop Steward,&quot; on this subject. Although he paid no attention to such letters as a rule, he proposed to circulate this oneto the Cabinet, as he thought, on the face of it, it presented a genuine case. fie proposed to discuss the question of gravity withthe President of the Board of Education and the Food Controllerthat afternoon.The President of the Board of Education said that on theprevious Thursday he had had two long conferences with the brewers.At the morning conference he was the only Government representa-tive present, and they had discussed a number of questions connectedwith the reform of the licensing trade. At the other conference theFood Controller had been present, and they had merely discussed the specific question of gravity, which bad been referred to them by theWar Cabinet. The brewers bad impressed him favourably as fair-dealing men who desired to co-operate with the Government inschemes for liquor control. As a result of the interview he was quite convinced that the brewers were unable to guarantee that thewhole of the 13,000,000Z. of taxation which the Government proposedto remit would be employed to the benefit of the consumer even, ifthe average gravity was raised 3&quot; in every grade. While admittingthis, the brewers were prepared to give assurances that they wouldhonestly try to pass on the benefit to the consumer. The result of.the interview, as far as he was concerned, was that he came to theconclusion that the Government should keep the gravity at 1040&quot;and retain the 13,000,000^&apos;., and he was circulating a memorandum to this effect. The Food Controller, howTever, who was also circu-lating a Memorandum, advised the Government to raise the averagegravity. Mr. Fisher went on to say that, amongst other things, he- had proposed to the brewers that all beer under I020o should be sold at not more than 2d., and they had been prepared to accept that proposition so long as they were guaranteed that they would nothave to compete with mineral water manufacturers.The War Cabinet decided (oO To request the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos; to meet thePresident of the Board of Education and the FoodController that day, to discuss the question of averagegravity.(b.) Subject to the approval of the Conference referred to in (a),an announcement should be made forthwith to the effectthat   all  restrictions on   the quantity of beer to be.: brewed should be removed.
3 WC 580    *3. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Paper G.-248) on a proposal made by the Empire Resources Development Committee that a JointCommittee of both Houses should be set up to consider Stateparticipation in the development of natural resources and oppor-tunities in the Empire.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this question hadbeen raised by Mr. Wilson-Fox on the Debate on the Address, andthe Leader of the House had encouraged the latter to speak to him(Mr. Chamberlain). He had then asked Mr. Wilson-Fox to state his views on the question, and he had received from him the proposalfor the appointment of a Joint Committee of the two Houses, withthe following terms of reference : &quot; That a Select Committee be appointed for the purpose of considering whether the State can with general advantage tothe community embark upon a policy of engaging for profit,either directly or indirectly, in the establishment and conduct of productive and distributive enterprises and industries, andespecially such as are concerned with the provision of public and semi-public facilities and needs, or generally in the developmentof the natural resources and opportunities of the Empirewherever they may be found; and, if so, what limitation shouldbe imposed upon such activities ; and what organisation shouldbe established to ensure the prudent selection and efficientconduct of undertakings suitable for the purposes in view, and the protection of the financial interests of the State,&quot;together with, certain reasons explaining his proposal, which appearedon page 1 of the above-mentioned Memorandum. After consultationwith the Minister of Munitions, the President of the Board of Trade,and the Secretary of State for the Colonies, he had replied toMr. Wilson-Fox in the terms of the letter on p. 2 of his Memorandum,in which he pointed out various objections to the proposed scheme.The Empire Resources Development Committee had then replied,recognising the objections he had put forward, and had now limitedtheir proposals to the development of the oversea resources withinthe Empire, and they proposed that the Committee which they suggested should be set up should report (1.) Upon the acquisition of land within the British Empire.(2.) Upon fisheries in the waters of the Empire.(3.) Upon the possible development of the petroleum resourcesof the Empire.&quot;Mr. Chamberlain expressed the opinion that, in the present form of the proposals, it was for the Secretary of State for the Coloniesprimarily to consider whether it was compatible with our colonial policy that the British Government should assume possession of Crown lands or participate in ownership with local Governments inreturn for our financial assistance. He thought there was a greatdeal to be said for a proposition of this kind if there was plenty ofcapital available for the purpose, but he was faced at present withthe dearth of capital for our own urgent needs. It was quite possible that, even if the Government tried to borrow money for this&quot;purpose, it would not be forthcoming. On the whole he doubted the desirability of setting up a Commission at the present time.He would like, however, a preliminary discussion on the matter, andwhen the views of his colleagues had been given he proposed thatthe Secretary of State for the Colonies should formulate specificsuggestions for the consideration of the War Cabinet.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he was sorry to hear from the Chancellor of the Exchequer that there was nocapital&apos; available for such schemes. He thought it should not beimpossible to obtain   capital for the  development  of the  moreEmpire ResourcesDevelopmentCommittee.
promising parts of what he would call our dependent Empire. In hisopinion the development of our Imperial resources would be one ofthe best sources of revenue in future. He doubted very muchwhether we should be able to get along on our old methods of finance ;and we should have to look round for some new sources of revenue.While it did not appear that our dependent Empire would bring in agreat deal in the immediate future, he thought that a substantialreturn might be obtained at a later date for a small investment now.In any case the matter deserved enquiry. He could never under-stand why we obtained so little from the other parts of the Empire.We seemed to neglect them at first, and then, when we starteddeveloping their resources, we never obtained from them as much aswe deserved. The Suez Canal and Anglo-Persian Oil company were perhaps the only conspicuous exceptions to this.Mr. Bonar Law suggested that the Secretary of State for theColonies should go into this question arid come to the War cabinet with definite suggestions. Pie would like to say that, although itwas impossible to find money for this purpose during the war, whenhe was at the Colonial Office it had been constantly in his mind. Hethought it was folly not to develop where we could, and obtain ashare in the profits.The Secretary of State for War concurred in the view that therehad been a deplorable failure to develop the Empire&apos;s tropicalestates.The War Cabinet decided that-The Secretary of State for the Colonies should consider thequestion raised in the Memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, and should formulate definite proposals forthe consideration of the War Cabinet.Military Supplies 4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the for Serbia. Chancellor of the Exchequer regarding the provision of military supplies to Serbia (Paper G.T.-7477).The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that throughout thewar Serbia had been financed by France and England jointly, andthat for the last three years the arrangement had been that Serbiareceived the supplies required for her army, and a cash allowance(9,000,000 fr. a month), and the payment of the coupons of her debt.The supplies to the army were regulated by military conventions ofFebruary 1916 and July 1918. He now asked that these supplies should be terminated, and proposed that further cash advances shouldbe made between now and the end of the year up to 35,000,-000 fr.,and that supplies in kind from the War Office should cease as fromthe 30th June. Pie was much concerned about the Avhole question of loans to Allies, and could observe no principle on which loans weremade. At the present moment we were being pressed to assist theItalians, Roumanians, and Serbians, but why we should do so he hadnot yet been able to discover.The Secretary of State for War said that he agreed with theChancellor of the Exchequer that we made Joans to all and sundry,and he personally would like to see our efforts concentrated. Inthe present case of Serbia he would prefer the French to take overSerbia en bloc, but on the other hand we had agreed with theFrench to provide a certain proportion of their supplies; and he understood that the General Staff&apos; were anxious to continue this fora time at any rate. He would, however, undertake that no military supplies should be sent to the Serbians after the 30th Septembernext.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) No military supplies should be sent by this country toSerbia after the 30th September next, and that the
Responsibility for storage, Guarding,and Moving of &apos;Surplus Stores.5.. The War Cabinet bad before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (Paper G.T.-7423), together with aMemorandum by the Minister of Munitions (Paper G.T.-7474),regarding the responsibility for storage, guarding, and moving of surplus stores.The Secretary of State for War stated that at the presentmoment he was doing his best to demobilise and return to civilianlife as many men as possible, but he was hampered in this effort by theresponsibility which rested on the military for guarding the surplus stores. This entailed the retention of a large number of men.So long a.s we bad a compulsory army, there would be discontent,and it was for this reason that he wanted to send home speedily as-many men as possible. With that end in view he had instructed the Quartermaster-General to make proposals, and they had succeeded in cutting down by one-half the number of men requiredto look after salvage. As part of this policy he now asked that theMinistry of Munitions should take over the responsibility for alldisposable stores, and place the whole organisation in the hands of civilians.The Minister of Munitions said that it would be quite impossible in existing circumstances to improvise, without excessive delay, the .necessary staff and machinery for carrying out the executive andadministrative duties connected with the handling of stores, andfurther, even if such a course were practicable, any system underwhich two virtually duplicate organisations were established side by side in each theatre of war would be likely to lead to over-lapping of functions, ill-defined responsibility, and other serious administrative-difficulties. He was fully alive to the importance of disposing rapidly of the immense quantities of stores in thevarious theatres of war, particularly in the eastern area of France,and with this end in view he was already in communication withthe French Government with regard to their purchasing any surplus stores not required by us.The Chancellor of. the Exchequer said that the Minister ofMunitions bad consulted him with regard to the sale of surplus storesto the French Government. Although he (the Chancellor) wouldhave preferred some other arrangement owing to the fact that thiscourse would increase the debt of the French Government to our-selves, he had, on the representations of the Minister of Munitions,agreed that we must endeavour to sell to the French and spreadpayment over a number of years. He thought that, if the proposed agreement with the French Government was concluded, it would help to solve the difficulties of the Secretary of State for War,it would add to bis own.The First Lord of the Admiralty thought that the plan of theSecretary of State for War should be tried. This country had atthe present moment a vast number of unemployed, and he felt sure that, if generous terms were offered the required number of men would soon be obtained for dealing with stores in France.Mr. Bonar Law said that, although he was attractedWar Office plan, he feared it was impracticable.    At thethoughmoment anorganisationwas at work dealing with theseby thepresentsurplus[826]-729stores, and in any case a considerable interval must elapse before a civilian organisation could get to work. He saw no other solutionbut that the Secretary of State for War should continue to reduce,as he had been doing, the number of men engaged on salvage work,and that there should be closer co-operation between the Wa,r Officeand the Ministry of Munitions.secretary of State for War should notify the FrenchGovernment of this decision,(ft.) That cash advances should be made up to the end of theyear as proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
The War Cabinet decided that--(a.) The War Office should remain responsible for the organisa-tion dealing with the storage, guarding and moving of surplus stores, and that, the Secretary of State for war should continue to reduce as rapidly as was consistent with efficiency the number of men employed on salvagework.(o.) The War Office and the Ministry of Munitions should maintain the closest co-operation in this matter.Peace Celebrations. 6. With    reference    to    War     Cabinet     559,    Minute   6,Mr. Bonar Law said that, when he was last in Paris, the PrimeMinister had expressed the view that as soon as peace was signedthere would be a strong desire on the part of the nation to celebratethe event immediately without waiting for the functions in Augustwhich were being- organised by Lord Curzon&apos;s Committee. ThePrime Minister had therefore asked that the War Cabinet shouldtake this view into consideration when peace celebrations were underdiscussion.Lord Curzon said that, although personally he was against anypeace celebrations, he felt that the country expected demonstrations,and meant to have them. He could not quite agree with thediagnosis of the Prime Minister, and in his view the country was sobent on having the celebrations that, even if they burst out whenpeace was signed, they would still desire to carry out the moreelaborate plans which were being made for August next.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he agreed with lord Curzon ; the people were very keen on having some display bythe Navy, and the Admiralty wTas already arranging to bring anumber of ships up the Thames, &amp;c. If the date already fixed forthe celebrations was anticipated, it would be impossible to do this.The Secretary of State for War said that in his view, supposingpeace was signed at the beginning of next week, it would cause noexcitement. He was very keen that there should be organisedcelebrations in August, as it was the anniversary of the outbreak ofhostilities, and favoured adhering to the policy advocateI. by thePeace Celebrations Committee.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed, but suggested that, inorder to meet the Prime Ministers point and. to guard againstunorganised demonstrations as soon as peace was signed, a statement should again be issued to the effect that peace celebrations wouldnot take place until August next, as time was required for thenecessary arrangements.The Minister of Labour said that he did not think there wouldbe demonstrations when peace was signed, provided the public were informed that the celebrations would be held on a specified date.H e would like to bring the question of payment of wages during thepeace holidays before the Cabinet. When the armistice was signedthere had been some difficulty regarding pay to persons engaged on government work. In order that this difficulty should not occuragain, he recommended that Tuesday, the 5th August, as well asMonday, the 4th August, should be declared a Bank Holiday, andthat the Cabinet should agree that employees in permanent Govern-ment establishments should be paid for these days, thus excludingtemporary establishments. He had heard that private employersdid not propose to pay any wages fur the Tuesday.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Acting Secretary should inform the Prime minister that the Cabinet was of the opinion that the signature of peace should not be the signal for premature peacecelebrations, aud that the date in August fixed for thepeace celebrations should be adhered, to.
August,(b.) Tuesday, the 5thholiday, and   employeesestablishments should receive pay for this dayWC 580should be declared a bankin   permanent   GovernmentCanadian Riot atWoodcote ParkHospital.7. The Secretary of State for War read to the War Cabinet thefollowing telegram which he said be bad just received, concerning ariot of Canadians at Woodcote Park Plospital: &quot;Canadians from Woodcote Park Hospital attacked thecivil police station at Epsom last night, where there were twoCanadian prisoners awaiting escort ; they killed a policesergeant, wounded an inspector, three sergeants, and eightconstables, and rescued the prisoners.&quot;Mr. Churchill said this was a very serious matter, and he had told General Home, with whom he had discussed it, that the canadians themselves must in the first place have an opportunityof clearing the affair up, of arresting the guilty persons and takingproceedings against them. If, however, after a reasonable time there was any doubt of the matter being settled, it would benecessary for the British Government to take steps to deal with it.He recognised that that would be a serious step for the War Officeto take, and he hoped it would not be necessary. Mr. Churchilladded that lie was also experiencing considerable difficulty inobtaining men to go to India in order to relieve the men there.The men who were placed on draft for India grumbled considerably,and wished to know how long they would be away. He had now had to promise that no Derby scheme men would be sent out toIndia.The War Cabinet took note of the statement of the Secretaryof State for War.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.
