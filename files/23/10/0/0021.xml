Increased Supply 1. With, reference to War Cabinet 570, Minute 2, the Chancellorof Beer. 0f ^ae Exchequer made a statement with regard to the increasedsupply of beer. Upon the introduction of the Budget he had announced the policy of the Cabinet to allow 20,000,000 standardbarrels to be brewed, of an average gravity of 1040&quot;, which was anincrease of barrelage and a considerable increase in average gravity.Taxation was based on those proposals, and at the request of the liquor Restrictions Committee he had added that if there were anyfurther increase in the barrelage it wordd be accompanied by afurther increase of taxation, and that the trade must be prepared forthat. In view of the continued shortage of beer, the Cabinet had subsequently decided to increase the barrelage to 26,000,000 standardbarrels (W.C.-570, Minute 2). The Food Controller had announcedthat the price would be unchanged, that the average gravity would remain the same, and that he (the Chancellor of the Exchequer)would make proposals for additional taxation. Representations hadbeen made to him and Mr. Bonar Law asking them to be content with that portion of additional taxation which wordd came automati-cally from the increase in the number of standard barrels without raising the rate of duty, on the ground of a decreased cost per barrel due to the larger output. He estimated the extramargin of profit the brewers would make, owing to the costof production being spread over a larger trade, at 10s. per barrel.His attention had been drawn to the great discontent caused by thepresent quality of beer, and he had been asked to devote the 1Os. to improving the quality of the beer instead of taking it in taxation.He had discussed the matter at a meeting with the brewers and had stated his readiness to listen to proposals for improving the qualityinstead of taking the I3,000,OOOZ. in taxation. He had suggestedthat the matter should be adjusted by undertaking to sell 4d. beerfor 3d.,&apos; 5d. beer for 4d., &amp;c, throughout the scale. This was rejected, on the ground that it wrould cost more than 10s., which was confirmed by the Customs. The Customs authorities put the value11 &apos;; of the concession of 10s. at a fraction over 2&quot; in gravity. The, brewers offered an increase in gravity of 3D at the same price, which&apos; &apos;, was rather more than the money value. He therefore proposed to.&apos;. &apos; , the Cabinet that the Food Controllers orders should be amended by adding 3D to the figure of gravity wherever gravity was mentionedin those orders. The average gravity would remain the same, namely,10400. He had put the point to the brewers that there was no guarantee that the improved quality would in fact be brewed. Theyhad said that, although they could not bind all brewers, they thoughtmost of them would loyally co-operate in improving the quality ofthe beer, especially if there were a clear indication from theGovernment that a higher gravity beer was required. The general5, t. impression at present existing was that the Government wanted them, -. . ; ... to brew &quot; washy &quot; beer. Generally speaking, he was of the opinionthat the proposals would be effective in improving the quality of beer, in view of the competition amongst the brewers andpublic-houses and the pressure from customers. The expertsat the Ministry of Food, he was informed, were of opinion thatthe increase of 3C would be appreciated by the public. TheGovernment were now receiving a tremendous revenue from beer.The irritation caused by control was growing. It was mostimportant to maintain prices in order to maintain revenue.Should the discontent both -as. to quality and quantitycontinue, the whole system might break down. On the general question of abolishing all restrictions, both the Food Controller,the Customs authorities, and the brewers believed that there worddnot be much change in the quality if the limit of average gravitywas taken off. The limit affected mainly special kinds of beer.Special classes of the trade, particularly the Burton trade and brewersof London stout, had been hit very hard. At the present scale ofprices it did not pay the brewer to brew over 10520, and he did not
think that a removal of the average gravity limit would much increasethe quantity of the heavy beers. The removal of the limit wouldmake it clear that the Government were no longer responsible forbad quality. Neither did he think that limiting the barrelage had much effect, for we were now very near the pre-war quantity. his attention had been called by various Members of Parliament to theextreme dissatisfaction in their constituencies owing to shortage of beer, and the view was generally expressed that if control were carried too far we might risk everything by attempting to maintain it.Mr. Bonar Law asked whether the Chancellor of the exchequer was sure that the brewers would brew the additional quantity of beer required unless they were guaranteed a higher price.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said the Customs authoritiesthought the beer would be brewed, although they were not quite certain.The effect of his proposals would be to increase the quality ofthe lowest classes of beer. At present, in order to be able to brewcertain special brands of heavy beer, some brewers were obliged,in order to keep within the average gravity on their total produc-tion to brew a large quantity of &quot;wash,&quot; which-was sold to otherbrewers and used to water down their ordinary brew. He wouldlike to emphasise that he was in a very embarrassing position, inthat no Minister was responsible for the Liquor Control Board. Inhis discussions on the Budget he had had to explain that, asChancellor of the Exchequer, his taxation proposals were made to fit in with the decision of the Cabinet on restrictions, whereas it was generally assumed that the restrictions were imposed by him forfiscal reasons. Similarly, Mr. Roberts was in a difficult position in having to defend restrictions in the House of Commons, which hethought were unwise.Mr. Bonar Law said that in view of the policy announced bythe Government, he thought it would be a great mistake at thisstage to alter the average gravity erratically. At the same time hehad received very insistent icomplaints about the quality of beer.Representatives of the Labour Party, on whose opinion he placedgreat weight, advised him that hostility to the Government was onaccount not only of the shortage of beer, but quite as much owingto bad quality. He thought it would be difficult to face the Houseunless some guarantee could be given that the gravity of the beerwould be raised. He asked whether it would not be possible to fixan under limit as well as an upper limit.The Food Controller said that that would be possible. Repre-sentations had been made to him that the range of quality in eachscale of beer had been fixed too wide.We must be able to give an assurance to the public that thequality would be improved. Personally he thought it would be.The reputation of the brewers was at stake, and the competitionwould be keen. He had received many complaints by tenants onaccount of the prices charged by brewers. Owing to the varyingconditions in different districts he had found it impossible to judgethem on their merits, and had therefore arranged for District Com-mittees to be set up in every area representing the brewers and the tenants on the analogy of the Joint Industrial Councils. All corn-plaints were referred to these Committees, and from them to a Boardof Appeal. If the matter could not there be settled, there was a finalappeal to the Ministry of Food. He proposed to call these autho-rities together and endeavour to get them to agree, in their respectiveareas, that the brewers should improve the quality to the extentdesired. His original proposal had been to reduce the price of beerby Id., but he was advised that this was not practicable within the range of prices established, and he had therefore agreed to anall-round increase of 3D.Mr. Bonar Law observed that if the Chancellor of the Exchequersschemes were adopted the Government would be going back on their

He had suggestedthat the matter should be adjusted by undertaking to sell 4d. beerfor 3d., 5d. beer for 4d., &amp;c, throughout the scale. This was rejected, on the ground that it would cost more than 10s., which was confirmed by the Customs. The Customs authorities put the valueof the concession of 10s. at a fraction over 2&quot; in gravity.

declarations, and thereupon, if they decided to give up the extrataxation, they must be able to give a definite guarantee to the Houseof Commons that quality would be improved.The First Lord of the Admiralty said he felt sure that competi-tion amongst the brewers and public-houses would secure the improved quality.Mr. Bonar Law said that while no doubt that was true, they didnot provide a guarantee which he could state in the House ofCommons.The President of the Board of Education agreed that therewas great discontent as to the shortage of beer. He had noobjection to increasing the barrelage, but would be very sorry tosee the average gravity raised. It had only recently been increased from 10320 to 10400, and the full effect of that increase was not yetfelt. He thought it would be a sign of weakness if the government now abandoned the average gravity of 1040\ The real question forconsideration was whether the 13,000,000Z. revenue should be abandoned in the hope, which was not certain of fulfilment, thatthe brewers would improve the quality. Moreover, there was evidence that the brewers were learning to brew more palatablelight beer. In Scotland the difficiilty as to quality did not exist.In England the brewers wrere learning to improve it, and a taste for light beer was being formed. The Government ought not lightlyto abandon the chance of establishing the taste for light beerthroughout the country. If a sufficient quantity of beer were pro-vided, that, in conjunction with the recent rise of 80 in gravity,ought to suffice. If, on the other hand, the Cabinet thought that something must be done, was it necessarv to abandon the whole ofthe 13,000,000Z. ?The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was impossible tosplit the amount in practice. The 10s. represented just over 2Q,and the brewers offered to increase the gravity by 3&quot;.Lord d&apos;abernon said that the Government would losel3,000,000Land wrould gain nothing. If they had not met the discontent by increasing the gravity from 10320 to 10400, was it reasonable to expect that they wrould do so by so small an increase as 3C. Ineffect, the public wordd receive a higher gravity beer for the sameprice.Mr. Bonar Law pointed out,that by the Chancellor of the exchequers proposal the brewers would be compelled to improve the quality of their beer all along the line. The lowest quality beerwould be improved.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that what had been doneby raising the gravity to 1040&quot; was merely to enable the brewers tobrew more of the middle gravity beers without improving the quality of the lowest grades.   That was the way the average was secured.Lord d&apos;abernon did not agree. The object of raising theaverage gravity from 10320 to 1040&quot; was to diminish or improve the &quot; wash,&quot; and, in bis view, that was being done.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the object would never be achieved until a limit was put below which they may. not brew.Mr. Bonar Law said that it wras put to him at the time that theeffect of raising the gravity to 1040&quot; would be the brewing of alarger proportion of heavier beer without altering the quality of thelower price beer. If Lord d&apos;abernon were right there certainlywould be no sense in abandoning the 13,000,000LLord d&apos;abernon contended that the quality had already been improved all along the scale by raising the gravity to 1040&quot;. Ifthis had not occurred then the whole policy of raising gravity hadbeen a failure.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the increase ingravity had merely enabled the brewers to brew a larger quantity of5d. and 6d. beers and the special brands.Lord d&apos;abernon said that the discontent had arisen mainly from
the alleged large quantity of extremely &quot;washy&quot; beer beingbrewed, and not from the absence of heavy beers.The Government were urged to raise the average gravity inorder to get rid of this grievance, and the alterations had beenmade largely to accomplish this purpose.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had originallysuggested that the remedy was to put a minimum gravity. He wasmet by the argument that that would prevent brewers from brewinga weak beer, and that that woidd be a very bad example. As a matterof fact, a brewer had protested strongly to him against the proposal toraise the whole gravity, for the reason that that would cut down theamount of heavy beer he could brew.The Eirst Lord of the Admiralty was confident that the reportsof discontent were only too well-founded in regard to some parts ofEngland. In the west of England there were even processionsof men going about from one public house to another until they came to one which was well stocked with beer, which they proceeded to exhaust. One inevitable consequence of Government control wasthat the Government were blamed for every cause contributing tothe shortage in quantity or bad quality of beer, although they mighthave nothing to do with it. If the Government did not now make concessions, they would undoubtedly be driven to it later on by an agitation of a very disagreeable character.Lord D&apos;Abernon said that he would be glad to see theGovernment give up control of quantity, but he was very strongly against the gravity being raised unnecessarily. An increase ingravity was not the same thing as an improvement in quality.Mr. Bonar Law said there was a difference of opinion about that. A brewer, who had learned to make a good light beer, andhad therefore no interest in the matter, had expressed to himexactly the opposite opinion.Lord D&apos;Abernon said that another brewer had informed him that he was now brewing a light beer, which before the war he had thought it quite impossible to brew. If the proposals suggestedwere carried out it would mean losing 13,()0O,0OOZ of revenue andgaining nothing.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that all the brewerswere learning to brew lighter beer. The Scottish brewers werebrewing a beer of a special quality, but this was partly owing to aspecial quality of barley tl^ used, which was limited in quantity and could not therefore be made universal.The Food Controller asked whether the total removal of restrictions was ruled out. In his opinion, it would be so long-before the Government were able to deal with the future of the liquor trade that they would not be able to resist the agitation inthe country in the meanwhile. He thought it would be much better for the Government &quot;to give up restrictions altogether than to yield piecemeal. He believed that natural circumstances were sufficiently restrictive to prevent abuse. Scarcity of labour and therise in the cost of&apos; materials would alone have that effect. the popular impression at present was that the restrictions were attribu-table to the policy of the Government, and that impression couldonly be removed by abolishing them.Mr. Bonar Law drew attention to the fact that the PrimeMinister and himself at the time of the General Election had under-taken that they would endeavour to secure a proper adaptation to peace conditions of the experience which had been gained during thewar. Until the Government had made up their minds as to whatexactly they were going to do in regard to the liquor trade hethought it would be unwise to remove the restrictions altogether.If they were removed now it would be difficult to re-impose themlater on.Lord d&apos;Abernon agreed that the Liquor Control Board shouldbe under Ministerial control.   Its constitutional position was at[826]-684 C
present anomalous. It was also most necessary to have a new-authority. The Central Board was essentially a war authority;therefore its influence was waning, and it was impossible for it tocontinue effectively. A new authority, even with less powers, would,be much more capable of maintaining the restrictions which were undoubtedly desirable.The Chancellor of the Excheqiier said that, in the present stateof public opinion, he would be afraid to go to the House of commons and ask for an additional l()a. in revenue per barrel of beer. the brewers had accepted the Budget proposals, but they would resist any further imposition, and if once a real agitation were directed against the price of beer the whole of this large revenue wouldbe in danger.The President of the Board of Education said he had noobjection to the Chancellor of the Exchequers proposal if the averagegravity were kept at 10400, provided they were really going to get abetter supply of the lighter beer in exchange for the sacrifice of13,0OO,O00L revenue, but he saw no guarantee of that beyond avague assurance from the brewers.Mr. Bonar Law pointed out that if the proposals were acceptedthey would have the important effect of preventing agitation againstthe Budget in the trade. Such an agitation would be very dangerous,and would spread all over the country, working upon the generaldiscontent.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that the Ministerof Food should be asked to resume negotiations with the brewers onthe basis of a 3D increase, at the same time requiring an assurance from them that they would allow the consumer the benefit by placinga limit on the lowest gravity that could be brewed.The First Lord of the Admiralty was sure that if once it were stated in Parliament that the Government had removed all restrictions on brewing that they reasonably could, if the supplyof beer in any district still remained of an inferior character thepublic-houses would be wrecked. Consequently, the brewers andthe publicans would be frightened into compliance. In view of the harvest, an early announcement was most desirable.The Minister of Labour said that there was great discontent among the working classes in regard to the quality of beer,particularly on the Clyde. If the quality were improved thediscontent would certainly be allayed.The President of the Board of Trade said that, in his opinion,it was worth spending a great deal of money to be able to supplybeer of appropriate quality and in sufficient quantity. He was allin favour of removing as many restrictions as possible, and wouldadvocate allowing the 13,000,O00Z. to be abandoned.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that the treasury would still receive an extra 21,00O,O00L over the Budget proposals,on account of the increased barrelage.Lord D&apos;Abernon drew attention to the enormous rise in breweryshares since the Budget. Unless great care were taken, there wouldbe another big boom in brewery shares as the result of the relaxation of Government restrictions, of such extent that it might amount - toa scandal, and it would be said, by those who were not aware of thefacts, that the Government, were in the pocket of the brewing trade.Mr. Bonar Law said that he was informed that the rise was dueto the decrease in the Excess Profits Duty. He suggested that theChancellor of the Exchequer should get a return from the InlandRevenue authorities showing precisely what profits had been madeby the brewers. He had met a deputation of brewers last year, andthe statement they made was that, while soxne brewers were makinglarge profits, others had been very badly hit.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that, while therewere big profits, at the same time there was greatly increased expensein carriage and materials.     In munition areas, and in places where
there was a large demand for cheap beer, the brewers had done very well, bat brewers who specialised in particular brands of better-classbeer, and also those who had been least efficient in conductingtheir business, had been very badly hit.The Food Controller pointed out, that that was bound to happenwherever any commodity was controlled. Those producing specialtypes of the commodity, and those whose businesses were not runon the most efficient lines, were very frequently badly affected, whilebigger businesses with the most efficient organisation had madeenormous profits.Lord LVAbernon stated his opinion that profits to-day were twoor three times- the pre-war profits throughout, both wholesale and retail, and that the present decision of the Cabinet woidd accentuatethis unless great precautions were taken.Mr. Bonar Law said that another problem was that of the shortageof whisky.Lord D&apos;Abernon said that the recent decisions of the Govern-ment had brought the supply of whisky up to 75 per cent, of thepre-war consumption.Mr. Bonar Law asked whether there was no way of getting it into circulation.The Food Controller pointed out that the whisky was in existencebut that it was impossible to compel the retailers to sell it.Lord D&apos;Abernon suggested that that was caused partly by thedearth of beer.The Food Controller agreed. The retailers would not sell to private people when a publican, who could sell in small quantities overthe counter, would pay .18s. a bottle, whereas the controlled price perbottle was 10s. 6d. It was almost impossible to trace all transactions and see that the control was observed. He advised that theGovernment should abandon the control altogether, because the onus of the shortage, which was in fact caused by the tradersthemselves, was being attributed to the Government.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was under theimpression that the spirit trade was under a restriction imposed by thePrime Minister when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, that nospirits might be sold under three years old. Consequently it wasnecessary to wait for three years after distillation, and the effect of theremoval of the restrictions on distillation would not be immediate.Lord Curzon said that he could not agree that the Chancellor ofthe Exchequers proposals were desirable. Pie could see no reasonfor sacrificing 13,000,0007.The President of the Board of Education said he agreed with lord Curzon. He did not see how the Government could guarantee that the quality of the beer would in fact be improved.Mr. Bonar Law pointed out that the Government would not agree to give up the 10s. extra revenue unless the brewers wouldgive them an adequate guarantee that the quality would in fact be improved.The War Cabinet decided that (1.) Subject to the approval of the Prime Minister, the FoodController should be authorised to negotiate with the brewers on the basis :- (a.) That the gravity of beer in each scale should beincreased by 30, the average gravity to remain at10400, and the price to remain the same ;(b.) A minimum limit of gravity to be imposed ;(c.) The brewers to furnish a guarantee satisfactory toParliament that their part of the agreement would be carried out.
The Eailway 2. With   reference   to   War  Cabinet  502,   Minute  5   andSituation in Appendix, the War Cabinet had under consideration a MemorandumSouth Russia, &quot;by the Secretary of State for War on the Railway Situation in south russia (G.T.-7348). The Memorandum pointed out that thecondition of the railways in the area controlled by General Denikinwas very unsatisfactory ; their capacity had dropped to 20 per cent,as compared with pre-war clays, and the quantity of stores on handwas barely sufficient for four months. This state of affairs Avasseriously affecting the military situation. The minimum value ofthe material required was 500,0001. for actual railway stores and afurther 500,O0OZ. for equipment, clothing, and medical stores forthe railway staffs, and certain lorries. The question had been taken up with the Supreme Economic Council in Paris, but the council had refused assistance, as the area was not one for which it had made itself responsible.The Deputy-Director of Military Operations said that thegeneral staff regarded the Avkole success of future operations inSouth Russia as hingeing upon the re-establishment of railwaycommunication. General Denikiu had at present only 240 loco-motives out of 800 which could be used. It was, however, notlocomotives that were required, but material for their repair. Theefficiency of the Russian railway employes was much affected bythe fact that they had no proper clothes or boots, and GeneralBriggs, the British Staff Officer attached to General Denikin, was pressing for the immediate supply of the articles enumerated in theWar Office Memorandum. General&apos; Kirke pointed out that untilthe railway service was effectively reorganised it was impossible forGeneral Denikin to distribute and make proper use of the greatquantities of military stores which we had supplied to him.Moreover, the political situation in the Caucasus would be greatly influenced by the success or failure of General Denikin, and thisaffected the possibility of withdrawing our troops.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that 12,500,0007. sterlinghad already been placed at the disposal of the Siupreme economic council in Paris for relief purposes in Russia. In the case iioavbefore the Cabinet the familiar procedure had been adopted, that isto say, that the Supreme Economic Council had been approached indie first instance and, as assistance was not forthcoming in that quarter, application had been made to the War Cabinet. The whole burden of fighting the Bolshevists in Russia was now being borneby Great Britain alone, and the situation was becoming intolerable.The million pounds now asked for might be no great matter, but itmust be remembered that it was required in order to distributemillions of pounds of stores wdiich had been sent out to general denikin. He understood that a certain amount of railway material would be shortly taken awaj- from Salonika, in which case heenquired whether it could not-be diverted to South Russia. If, aslie understood, we were exceedingly short of railway material in thiscountry, we would, hardly be justified in supplying general denikin. It was not so much the actual cost of the material required but the fact that this material was urgently needed for ourIn consideration of the above, the Governmentwould not claim from the brewers an additional revenue of 13,000,0007., representing the increased profit whichthe brewers would make by reason of the decrease inthe cost of production on the increased output.(2.) The Minister of Food should investigate the reasons for theshortage in the supply of whisky, particularly haviugregard to the withholding of supplies by traders and thesale of Avhisky secretly at prices above the controlledprice, and should report to the War Cabinet.
Proposed Transferof Aeroplanes bythe Eoyal AirForce to DominionGovernments.[826]-6843. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the under-Secretary of State for Air (Paper G.T.-7332) regarding theproposed transfer of aeroplanes by the Royal Air Force to DominionGovernments. The memorandum stated that the Air Council had had before them a request from the Canadian Air Force for the presentation to that Force of ninety-two aeroplanes and engines toassist the Canadian Government in starting a permanent AirForce. The Air Council thought this request shotiTd be con-sidered as part of the general question whether, and if so, underwhat conditions, the Governments of the Dominions should be assisted in initiating independent military Air Forces, a similarquestion having been raised on behalf of South Africa. The viewof the Air Council was that a free gift of a certain number of machines should be made. In this way the pressure on storagespace on account of the number of machines which there was no prospect of selling until they had become practically useless wouldbe alleviated to some extent, and this course was recommended bythe fact that, in the view of the Disposal Board, when everydemand which could reasonably be foreseen was met, there would still remain a considerable surplus of machines of certain typeswhich would not have a higher value than scrap value because theyhad become obsolete or deteriorated through storage.The Under-Secretary of State for Air said that he proposed,with the approval of the War Cabinet, that when the Air council had in stock 500 or more machines or engines of any one typesurplus to active and reserve requirements of the Royal Air Force,Down railways in order to set our trade going once more. Hosuggested, as another alternative, that the Minister of Munitionsshould be consulted as to the possibility of supplying general denikin&apos;s requirements from stores which had been returned from france and elsewhere.The President of the Board of Trade pointed out that therewas a very grave shortage of iron and steel at present for ourown rolling stock. Already our export trade was being held up toa serious extent on this account, and be thought it would be short-sighted policy for us to provide material for South Russia at theexpense of essential services in this county. He felt it his duty to impress upon the War Cabinet the fact that the transport situationin Great Britain gave cause for profound anxiety.Sir Graeme Thomson, in reply to an enquiry, said that theMinistry of Shipping might be able to provide the necessary tonnage,but he would like to be informed as to what the requirements would amount to in bulk. He noticed that among the things particularly asked for were lorries, which were especially bulky articles, and he hoped that these could be supplied from countries nearer to south russia than Great Britain.Mr. Bonar Law thought that the War Office should explain in greater detail exactly what they wanted, shewing where they thought they could get it, and what it would all amount to in bulk.This might be done by that Department in consultation with theBoard of Trade and the Ministry of Munitions.The War Cabinet decided :  (1.) That the War Office should prepare detailed estimates ofthese requirements, indicating possible sources of supply,and stating exact amount of tonnage that would be needed.(2.) To sanction the required expenditure if the President ofthe Board of Trade, after consultation with.the Ministryof Munitions, was satisfied that the said requirementscould be met without any sacrifice of the essential interests of this country.
/Supply of railway material to south Africa.Report of Indus-trial Conference:Minimum Eatesof Wages and&apos;Appointment of commission.4. With reference tp War Cabinet 571, Minute 2, relating to thegift of railway material to South Africa, the Under-Secretary ofState for the Colonies said that he had seen General Botha, who had informed him that he quite understood that the offer made by him(Colonel Amery) was only a tentative one, and that the public announce-ment was due to a misunderstanding on the part of Mr. Burton, theMinister of Railways in South Africa. General Botha would be glad,however, if the Government would offer the Government of SouthAfrica rails to the value of 500,OOOZ. as soon as possible, as he wishedto make arrangements regarding shipment.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, after looking more closely into this question, he offered no objection to the proposal of the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies.The War Cabinet decided That the Government of South Africa should be offered second-class rails and material in France up to the value of500,000L, and that the details shoxdd be arranged betweenthe Ministry of Munitions and the South African Govern-ment.5. With reference to War Cabinet 557, Minute 4, the MinisteroE Labour said that he had that afternoon to meet the JointEmployers and Workmens Committee of the Industrial Conference^and make reply to them on behalf of the Government regarding(a) limitation of hours, (b) minimum rates of wages, and (if the answer on these two questions was satisfactory) (c) the setting up ofa National Industrial Conference; the last was regarded as of supreme importance by the employers. In the Joint Report ofEmployers and Workmen, they had laid it down inter alia that they required an announcement on the minimum wage immediately, theprinciple to be accepted by the Government and a Commission setpower should he given to put a number not exceeding 100 at thedisposal of a Dominion free of cost.The First Lord said that the Admiralty were asked to giveships to the Dominions, and proposed to do so on the same principleso long as the loss to the United Kingdom would not exceeda reasonable sum.The Secretary of State for India thought that if the cabinet agreed to the Under-Secretary of State for Airs proposal, india should be included with the Dominions. He did not think that ifthe Dominions were given free gifts of aeroplanes India should beexpected to pay for hers.Mr. Bonar Law said that he saw no objection to General Seely&apos;proposal. He thought, however, the fact that we were making a gift of aeroplanes to the Dominions and India should be made widely known to the public.The Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies said that a numberof colonial Governments and protectorates would be glad of the gift of a few machines.The War Cabinet decided-fa.) To approve of the Under-Secretary of State for Air&apos;proposal that a gift of aeroplanes not exceeding 100should be made to each Dominion and India, andthat a gift of a few machines should be made to anycolonial Government or protectorate requiring them.These machines would be in addition to those to bereturned to the Dominions free of cost to replace the machines given by the Dominions during the war.(o.) That the Under-Secretary of State for Air should arrangefor adequate publicity to be given this action by BisMajesty&apos;s Government.
up to fix rates. He (Sir R. Home) at first had thought that this wasnot feasible, but he had now arrived at a compromise with the JointCommittee to the effect that a Bill should be passed. The preamble to the Bill would admit the expediency of fixing minimum rates,and would provide for the appointment of a Commission for thepurpose of enquiring into the basis on which such minimum rates should be fixed, regard being had (a) to the cost of living in thevarious districts, the circumstances of industries in the district, andsuch other matters as appeared to the Commissioners to be relevant,(6) the methods by which such minimum time rates of wages shouldbe fixed, and by which they should be varied as and when occasionrequired, (c) the granting of exemptions from the rates so fixed inthe case of infirm and incapable workers and for exceptional causes,and the method on which such exemptions should be granted.The Government had already accepted the principle of theminimum wage (W.C. 557/4), and he thought that a commission appointed with the above terms of reference would meet the case.The Ministry of Labour added that the Commissioners were to beappointed by the Employers and the Workmen of the national industrial Conference when set up, but the Government wouldappoint the Chairman. The Governments hands would still be-free when the Report was received.The Acting President of the Board of Trade said that in therecent advances made in Naval Pay a successful effort had beenmade to keep the adult age at 19, and he was working for this ageon the railways. If the Joint Committee of Employers and Workmenreduced the adult age to IS, a similar age would either at once orsoon have to be adopted in the Navy and on the Railways.The Ministry of Labour replied that both employers and workmen always regarded the adult age as IS, and he had in facthad some difficulty in excluding people under that age.With regard to the question of hours, the Ministry of Laboursaid that the Board of Agriculture did not now object to being included with other industries in a 48-hour week, but they wantedelasticitj- in its application to agricultural labour. He would that afternoon, however, try to exclude agriculture from the statutory48-hour week. He now asked the Cabinet if he could proceed withthe Minimum Rates of AVages Commission Bill and inform theEmployers and Workmen&apos;s Committee that afternoon that theGovernment would introduce a 48-hour week Bill for industrial workers only.The Committee had wished to extend the forty-eight hour week to commercial work, but he had not been able to agree to that.This proposal would automatically extend to domestic servants.The First Lord emphasised the gravity of the hours question in agriculture and the bad effect on the milk supply, and of therecent decisions by the Wages Boards.Mr. Bonar Law said that, if the Cabinet agreed to Sir R.Horne&apos;s proposal, they would only be re-affirming the principle theyhad already arrived at with regard to these questions.The War Cabinet approved of the action Sir R. Horne proposedto take.6. The First Lord informed the Avar Cabinet that on theprevious day over 575 mines had been swept up as compared withthe average daily number of 200. It was hoped to complete thework by the end of July. There were 15,000 men and 670 officersengaged on the work.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,May 29, 1919.
