The War Cabinet had again under consideration a Memoran-dum by Lord Robert Cecil (Paper G.T.-7242), and a Memorandumby Sir Auckland Geddes (Paper G.T.-7270) on the question of the censorship of cables and wireless.The Postmaster-General read a letter which he had received* from the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, which he said wastypical of letters he was receiving almost daily from every part ofthe country. The mercantile community was growing more andmore impatient and the position was becoming intolerable. It wasvitalby important to arrest the threatened paralysis of trade.The President of the Board of Trade said that, as instructed by the War Cabinet (War Cabinet 566, Minute 2), he had madecareful encpuiries into the whole question of the censorship. As aresult, it had become clear to him that the War Cabinet must decidedefinitely, as a matter of policy, Whether the special services whichthe censorship could render were worth the enormous price the[826]--695 B
country was paying. It was impossible to maintain the specialservices unless the censorship was retained. He could estimate,with some degree of accuracy, the extent of the damage to trade,but he was not in a position to determine the value of the saidservices. As a result of the censorship the lines, which were inbad repair, were heavily congested, and delays of three weeks werethe general rule in the case of messages to distant markets. Theuse of private codes, which at present was not permitted, mightslightly ameliorate the situation, but half-measures would not provideany real remedy.The Acting-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that attheir last discussion two points had been raised: (1) If the censor-ship were withdrawn, would it be possible to obtain the informa-tion in any other wTay ? The Postmaster-General had then saidthat he thought we possessed this power under the existing law ;(2) that delays were due to congestion on the cables more than toany action by the Government. Lord Curzon then explained thevalue of the censorship from the Foreign Office point of view.The Postmaster-General stated, in regard to Lord Curzon&apos;s first point, that he was informed that in the case of emergency he was empowered, when authorised by a Secretary of State, to insist uponthe cable companies handing over to him copies of all telegramsreceived. He had recently arranged that State and private messagesshould have the use of the cables in equal proportions except forpriority &quot;A.&quot; He himself was strongly in favour of abolishing the censorship, as he thought that, in the present state of thecountry&apos;s trade, commercial interests were paramount.Mr. Bonar Law w^as of opinion that, in view of the desirabilityof rehabilitating our trade as soon as possible, it was necessary toget rid of the censorship without delay. The question was whetherthe present moment wras opportune for its complete removal. Itmight be preferable to break it down gradually. He understoodthat if private codes were permitted, a large special staff would berequired to deal with them. He thought that perhaps private codesmight be permitted so long as the Government reserved to them-selves the power to prohibit their use in certain cases. He fully appreciated the value of the censorship from the point of view ofthe fighting services, but he thought those services were inclined tounderestimate the real and the psychological effect on trade of therestrictions now in force. &apos;Colonel Lord William Percy explained the various disadvantages of allowing the use of private codes.The Secretary of State for War said that he had not beenconvinced by the arguments which had been advanced againstpermitting the use of private codes. He was, however, satisfiedthat, at the present juncture, it would be most dangerous to remove the censorship. The whole world was in the melting-pot, and wewere faced with the reaction following upon the Peace negotiations.The value of the censorship, from the point of view of his Depart-ment, had been fully demonstrated, and the War Office could not recommend any relaxation, at least until Peace with Germany hadbeen signed.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that his Naval Adviserswere unanimously against the abolition of the censorship at the -present moment. It was a question of balancing its value, for political purposes, against the loss of trade. If, however, thingswent wrong with us politically, our trade would be in a urach worsestate. He, himself, would maintainthe censorship until Peace was signed..The Acting-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that ithad been proposed to abolish the censorship in practice, but to easematters by permitting the use of private codes. He, himself,suggested that a period might be fixed up to which the presentsystem should be allowed to survive. He agreed with the FirstLord and the Secretary of State for War that the censorship shouldbe maintained until Peace was signed and we knew where we were on the main issue.
3WC 575       72After some discussion, the Secretary of State for the colonies and the Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that they were in favourof permitting the use of private codes.The President of the Board of Trade thought that there was nohalfway-house. The censorship, in his opinion, must either he maintained intact or abolished altogether.Mr. Bonar Law said that his own feeling was that private codesshould be allowed, and the earliest opportunity should be taken of abolishing the censorship altogether. He felt, however, in face ofthe attitude of the Acting-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, theSecretary of State for War, and the First Lord of the Admiralty,that the War Cabinet could not decide in that sense. At the sametime, every Chamber of Commerce in this country was profoundlydisturbed by the retention of the censorship, and enormous damage was unquestionably being done to our trade.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) It was desirable, in the interests of the country&apos;s trade,that the restrictions of censorship should be removed assoon as the political and military situations permitted ;(6.) The Acting-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the FirstLord of the Admiralty, the Secretary of State for War,and the Home Secretary, should examine the question,with special reference to the practicability of reintro-ducing private codes, and should report forthwith to theWar Cabinet.2. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the President of the Board of Trade (Paper G.T.-7363) on theimportation of German goods, in which it was stated that the allied and Associated Governments had decided that trade should be permitted within the occupied territories, that foodstuffs should beallowed to be imported into unoccupied Germany, that germany should be allowed to export all goods except war material, gold,silver, and securities^ that the resumption of trade should be permitted with the territories comprising the former AustrianEmpire, but not with Hungary, and that it had been left to each ofthe Allied and Associated Governments to decide for itself how far it would allow its own subjects to engage in trade in each case.In view of the possibility that the blockade would be raisedimmediately on the signature of the Peace Treaty, a decision of theWar Cabinet was required upon the following questions : (1.) Are imports from Germany to be treated like all otherimports when trade relations are resumed withGermany ?(2.) Are trade relations (so far as it is decided to permit them)to be resumed on the signature of peace ?Sir Auckland Geddes said that if any changes were to be made,a great deal of preliminary work would have to be done in advanceof any public announcement. There was a considerable outwardtrade to, and a little inward trade from, the occupied parts ofGermany. &apos; If it were decided to resume general trade withthe whole of Germany, there would be great difficulties inmaking the necessary aiTangements. The precautions to betaken against excessive imports would have to be worked outwith great care, owing to the very low level of the Germanexchange. Pie suggested that the proper course would be to make preparations for resuming trade- with Germany, and that theBoard of Trade should be empowered to impose special restrictionson imports from Germany, under the Defence of the Realm Act, inorder to prevent this country being flooded with accumulated stocks[826]-695 B 2Importation ofGerman Goods.
of German goods. It was necessary for the Government to realise that owing to the exchange situation we were in a most dangerousposition with regard to any article which the Germans wished tosend to this country. Because of the exchange theyAvould beable toundersell us in all directions, and we must be in a position to stop it.The War Cabinet decided that The Board of Trade should make the preparations necessaryfor resuming trade with Germany, and should draft thenecessary regulations under the Defence of the Realm Actto prevent this country from being flooded with stocks of manufactured goods accumulated in Germany, and should submit the same to the War Cabinet.Peace Celebrations:Eelease ofPrisoners.3. The War Cabinet had before them the following Questionregarding the release of prisoners on the signing of Peace, whichwas to be asked in the House of Commons : &quot; Whetherthe Prime Minister will advise His Majesty to grantan amnesty to men in prison for purely political, naval, andmilitary offences on the signing of Peace Treaty.&quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in his opinion, theprinciple of granting an amnesty to prisoners on occasions ofnational rejoicing was wrong; the idea belonged to systems oforiental barbarism when there was no other gaol delivery, andshoidd not be made to apply in this country, where no man wasimprisoned except by sentence of a Court of Justice.The First Lord of the Admiralty stated that representatives ofthe Admiralty had discussed the matter with the War Office and theAir Ministry, and had come to the conclusion that, if prisoners wereto be released, the precedent of the Coronation of 1910 should befollowed, when all persons imprisoned for ordinary disciplinarycrimes were released. Personally, however, he agreed with theviews expressed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and thought the answer to the Question in the House of Commons should be inthe negative.General agreement was expressed with these views.The War Cabinet decided that The Answer to the Question in the House of Commons shouldbe in the negative.Investigation of profits in Industry.4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Commissioner of Works (Paper G.T.-6834) regarding a proposed investigation of profits in industry. The Memorandumstated that, in view of Labour unrest and the continual accusationsof profiteering in various industries, a useful purpose would be served if the Government would establish a small. Committee of expert economists and accountants to investigate authoritatively theaverage interest earned on industrial capital over a number of years,and proposed, if the idea was approved, that the President of theBoard of Trade should be requested to draft tUe Terms of reference and to nominate the Committee.The President of the Board of Trade stated that his department was dealing with this matter on a much larger scale in connectionwith the fiscal proposals, which he hoped to bring before the cabinet at an early date. Any enquiry such as was suggested would createsomething which might prove more harmful than Labour unrest,i.e., Capital unrest.The First Commissioner of Works said that he was not aware that the President of the Board of Trade was already going into the
subject of his Memorandum, and in these circumstances he woiddbe glad to discuss the matter with him.The War Cabinet concurred.Government Cars 5  The War Cabinet had  before   them a Memorandum ontor Orhcial Use.       Government cars for official use (Paper G.T.-7359) by the FirstLord of the Admiralty.The War Cabinet decided To instruct the Acting-Secretary to ask the Heads of Depart-ments for a return showing the number of Governmentmotor cars assigned to the Departments, the officials towhom they were allocated, and the purposes for which theywere required.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,June 3, 1919.
