2Office Accommoda- 3. With reference to War Cabinet 550, Minute 2, the Wartion and Demobili- Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by Sir Auckland Geddessation. regarding the staffs of Government departments (G.T.-724.6).Sir Auckland Geddes said that he proposed, in order to reducethe staffs of departments as rapidly as possible, that, as therewas such a large number of men and women engaged on liquidation-tion work for the various departments, all liquidation work shouldbe removed from individual departments and concentrated in asingle building in the outskirts of London, under the control ofan expert or experts appointed with full powers to close and com-plete all outstanding transactions as soon as possible on the most advantageous terms. He thought a maximum establishment of,say, 10,000 should fee allowed, on which progressive reduction could be expected as the work proceeded.Lord Curzon suggested, if it were assumed that ai a givenperiod all offices should revert to normality, and if that periodwere fixed at, say, six months from now, then it might be possibleto lay down a progressive rate of demobilisation of staffs to takeplace during that period, thus reducing the total number of thestaff of each department by so many per week or per month.Sir Auckland Geddes said that he had considered this sug-gestion, and proposed to use it in some degree in connection withhis scheme of liquidation.The War Cabinet decided   .To adjourn the discussion until the following Monday, whenMinisters interested in the question should be asked toattend.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,May 15, 1919.o
