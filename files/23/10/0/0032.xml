The SouthportLabour Conference:Attendance ofForeign Delegates.1. The Home Secretary stated that he had just received in-formation that four Frenchmen and one Italian, who had beengranted passports, had arrived in this country that morning in orderto attend the Southport Labour Conference. He had had information to the effect that a Mr. De Kay, who had helped to finance &quot; TheHerald,&quot; and was in close touch with the German extremists andwith Lenin, had placed a sum of money, believed to be at Cook&apos;sBank, at the disposal of these Frenchmen for the purpose of(a) bringing about an international 24 hours&apos; strike; (b) sowingdisaffection in the British Army and Navy. The names of the fourFrenchmen were, M. Longuet, who was the editor of a Socialistpaper in Paris, M. Huysmans, M. Renaudel, and M. Jouhaux, and ofthe Italian, Signor Ludovici d&apos;Aragone. The Home Secretary had, onhis own responsibility, detained M. Longuet at Folkestone,-but the others were now in London and waiting to proceed to the SouthportConference at 1 o&apos;clock that day. He now asked for War cabinet authority to send the whole of this party back to France. TheFrenchmen were well-known extremists, and he had good reasons forsupposing- that they were attending the Southport Conference merely as a mask, and that their real intention was to spread disaffection inthe Navy and the Army. Should any question be raised in theHouse of Commons, he felt sure that he could give a satisfactoryanswer.(At this point Sir Basil Thomson entered.)Lord Curzon said that MM. Longuet and Renaudel were well-known French Socialists and, he understood, had been in this country before. He would like to know, therefore, what suspicions hadbeen aroused that made the Home Secretary distinguish the presentfrom the previous occasion.Sir Basil Thomson said that the circumstances were nowdifferent. M. Longuet had been in communication with well-knownrevolutionary and Bolshevist agencies. There was reliable informa-tion detailing the activities of these extremists in stirring up trouble with the French sailors. The passports of these gentlemen had beengiven by the Passport Office in Paris, he thought on the PassportOfficers own authority, but they were now enquiring into thismatter. Sir Basil Thomson added that another objection to theirattending the Southport Conference was that this conference wasnot of the ordinary industrial nature, but was called in order to urgepolitical action by the Triple Alliance.Lord Curzon asked whether the speeches of these FrenchSocialists had been subversive of military discipline.Sir Basil Thomson replied that his information was tWt thiswas the case, but he was unable to make a definite quotation.(The Minister of Labour entered at this point.)The Minister of Labour said that the Independent Labour party and the Triple Alliance were both meeting at Southport this week.The Labour forces of the country were at the moment, on the whole,inclined to be more tractable, and great care should be taken not toirritate them unnecessarily. With regard to the Triple Alliance, he.admitted that this vvas a more dangerous body, but he would pointout that, although they had expressed rather extreme views withregard to political action by industrial pressure, they had so far donelittle more than talk,- and he. doubted whether the present conferenceat Southport would come to much. In his opinion the present wouldbe a most unfortunate moment to choose to prevent these FrenchSocialists from attending the Southport Conference.The First Lord of the Admiralty. said that he thought theCabinet should consider the effect the suggested action by theHome Secretary would have in France. In his opinion it would create a very difficult situation, inasmuch as the French press was at the moment very tender over the Scapa Flow. incident, and a
- 1 023 WC 584      XUCtrefusal on our part to allow MM. Longuet and Renaudel to proceedto the Southport Conference might be attended by very unfortunate results. These two gentlemen were men of substance, and could notbe treated like the ordinary agitator. His advice was that theyshould be followed and watched. This course in itself might havethe effect of making them return to France of their own accord.The President of the Board of Trade was of the opinion that itwould be unwise to take action as suggested by the Home Secretary,unless we could present to the public a very good case. Affairs wereby way of settling down fairly comfortably as regards Labour,and the detention of such well-known Socialists as MM. Longuetand Renaudel might unsettle the Labour world at the very moment when they were getting into a more reasonable frame of mind,and when the influence of the more sober-minded leaders wasreasserting itself.Lord Curzon said that he feared the Government would notbe in a very strong position if they were to refuse permission tothis Socialist Party to proceed to Southport, especially as passportshad already been granted to them. He admitted that the case made out against M. Longuet was stronger than that against the others,but, even so, it would be unwise, in his opinion, to differentiate inthe treatment of this party ; either all must be made to return to france , or none. There was little doubt that the action suggested would create a commotion in the Labour world, and his own opinion was that the Government were not on strong enough ground to take any action. If he interpreted the feeling of the Cabinet rightly,this was also the general consensus of opinion- He saw no reason,however, as Sir Basil Thomson was shortly going to interview the delegates, why be should not tell, them that their journey had been delayed because of suspicions which had been aroused as to their intentions in this country. He might go so far as to inform them that they were only admitted to this country on the under-standing that they did not attempt to tamper with the loyalty ofour sailors and soldiers. He also thought that it would be advisable that they should be informed that their passports Avouldexpire at the conclusion of the Southport Conference.The &quot;War Cabinet decided that (a.) The extremists who had landed in this country for the expressed purpose of attending the Southport conference should be allowed to proceed thither, but that theyshould be informed that the delay which had attendedtheir journey was caused by suspicions regarding their intentions, and any overt act on their part would not be tolerated, and that any attempt to tamper with the loyalty of the army or navy would be followed by their immediate expulsion.(6.) The Home Secretary should confine the validity of theirpassports to the duration of the Southport Conference.Sinking of German 2. The First Lord of the Admiralty stated that he would haveShips at Scapa that afternoon a series of questions addressed to him in the House ofFlow. Commons with  regard to the sinking of German ships at ScapaFlow, one of which questions was asked why proper steps had notbeen taken by the Admiralty to prevent such an incident. he proposed, if the War Cabinet approved, to give the followinganswer : &quot; Full and detailed reports of the sinking of the german ships have not yet been received by the Admiralty. Admiralvon Renter stated verbally that he personally had given ordersfor the ships to be sunk, being under the impression that thearmistice had ceased at noon on Saturday. There would nothave been any difficulty in the German Admiral circulating
these orders since he was allowed to visit his own ships for thepurpose of maintaining discipline therein, and when doing so hewas conveyed in a British boat.&quot; The present position of the ships is as follows : &quot;10 battleships sunk, 1 afloat.&quot;  5 battle-cruisers sunk.&quot;  5 light cruisers sunk, 3 beached.&quot;30 destroyers sunk, 2 afloat, 18 beached.&quot;Salvage experts are now making an - examination, anduntil their report is received it is impossible to say whether thesunken ships may be salved, or to what extent they willinterfere with the&apos; anchorage or channel. The question of reparation for the sinking of these ships is now underconsideration by the Allies in Paris. The statement which hasappeared that the crews had been changed periodically isinaccurate. Sick men, &amp;c, had been exchanged as circum-stances arose. The total numbers of the care and maintenanceparty have been reduced from 4,700 to approximately 1,800.As regards the question why precautions were not taken by theAdmiralty to prevent tbe Germans from scuttling their ships,this was impossible as the ships were interned, not surrendered,and the Admiralty therefore had no power to guard them. Itis not correct that the na,val advisers of the Admiralty were infavour of interning. Their views were clearly and definitelyexpressed at. the time, but the decision of the heads of theAllied Governments was in favour of interning, and this has, ofcourse, controlled the situation ever since, and made theprevention of the scuttling impossible. I desire to deprecatethe attacks made in certain quarters upon Sir Rosslyn Wemyss,for which there is not the slighest justification.&quot;The main question which was now agitating the public mind was why this incident had been allowed to occur, and it had beensuggested that the Admiralty was to blame. In reality, the answer to this question was quite simple, inasmuch as these ships wereinterned and not surrendered. Internment carried with the rightof the Germans to look after their own ships, and made it illegal forthe British to place armed guards on board. There was a &quot;furtherallegation that the Admiralty had not given, at the time when thearmistice was signed, the right advice in advocating internmentrather than surrender of the German ships. The advice of theAdmiralty was that the German ships should be surrendered, and atthe Peace Conference the French and Italians had agreed with thisview. The United States, however, took the view, which ultimatelyprevailed, that the ships should be interned. He might that after-noon be pressed regarding this aspect of the question, and he feltthat, should this be the case, he would, be bound, in justice to theNaval advisers, to say that the advice of the Admiralty to the PeaceConference had been that the ships should be surrendered.Lord Curzon said that he thought that it would be perfectlyopen to the First Lord to state in the House of Commons, if asked adirect question as to whether the Admiralty advised internment orsurrender of the German ships at Scapa Flow, that the admiralty had been in favour of the latter course, but that this view had been over-ruled by our Allies.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To approve the proposed answer of the First Lord in theHouse of  Commons that afternoon  to the questionsaddressed to him regarding the Scapa Flow incident.(b.) That in tbe event of the First Lord being asked whether*        the Admiralty had advised internment or surrender ofthe German ships, he should state that the Admiralty
5 WC 584had advised surrender, but that this advice had been over-ruled by our Allies.iirTransport of Troops 3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theto India. Secretary of State for War (Paper G.T.-7510) and a Memorandumby the Minister of Shipping (Paper G.T.-7536) relating to thetransport of troops to India.The Secretary of State for War stated in his Memorandum thatthe Ministry of Shipping was asked on the 12th May to provideshipping direct for these troops from the United Kingdom to India.Certain special measures for the comfort and health of the troops were asked for, as they had to pass through the Red Sea at thehottest time of the year. These measures included a reduction ofthe usual numbers carried. The Ministry of Shipping repliedsuggesting that the troops should leave the United Kingdom by sea, and that some of the ships should disembark all their comple-ment in Egypt ; others half their complement of troops. All troopsdisembarked would be re-alloted to other vessels directly connect-ing, so that none of the troops would have to be accommodated inrest-camps. The Shipping Controller agreed to the percentage oftroops to be carried on vessels, with the exception of the numbers onthe lower decks. The Army Council replied that, for the importantreasons of health and discipline, they still considered that it was essential that the journey by sea should not be interrupted by thetranshipment suggested. As the battalions would only partiallyconsist of men enlisted on post-war conditions, it was essential fordiscipline that the units should be embarked as a whole, so that the commanding Officer could exercise direct control. The WarCabinet was therefore asked to decide whether (1.) The twenty battalions should be conveyed in suitable ships by complete units direct from the United Kingdom toIndia without transhipment ;(2.) This move was to take precedence over all other shipping-commitments.The Quartermaster-General said that in this case the ArmyCouncil felt most strongly that, as the Regular Army had practicallydisappeared and they were in process of forming a new RegularArmy, it was a matter of national interest that nothing should bedone to affect adversely its re-birth. It should also be rememberedthat the temper of the army was different from what it was someyears ago, and that it contained a number of disaffected men. Forthese reasons it was felt that every effort should be made to subject the men to the minimum of discomfort in travelling. It wasa King&apos;s Regulation that troops sent to hot climates should onlyproceed at certain times of the year. Owing to military necessity itwas essential that these troops should be sent to India immediately.&apos; Further, by the transhipment of troops in Egypt, as had beensuggested by the Shipping Controller, a risk would be run that theywould mix with disgruntled men now there. It should be remem-bered that the men were in a peculiar state, and if they were sent out under conditions such as would cause a disturbance there was nodoubt that it wouid react unfavourably on the whole of the Army.The Shipping Controller said that he appreciated the spirit inwhich the War Office approached this matter, but it was an absoluteimpossibility to meet all their demands. He had already agreed that from Egypt onwards the number of troops should be still further reduced by 50 per cent., making a total reduction of about 60 percent, as compared with the regulations. The Army Council, however,. . were not satisfied with this, and asked&apos; for a still further reduction inthe number of troops accommodated in the lower decks. The WarOffice also opposed the landing of men in Egypt for transhipment,[826]-751 &apos; C
and he had therefore agreed to direct transhipment without landing.Should the War Office demand for an uninterrupted journey be approved, the amount of shipping required would be very largely increased, about 50 per cent., and the demand could only be met by taking for the purpose ships now in the course of preparation forthe repatriation of Dominion troops. If the War Office could defersending the bulk of these troops until September and thereafter,however, it would make all the difference. He had made no mention of the expense of these proposals, which was enormous.The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he had endeavoured to defer the despatch of troops, but the Commander-in-Chief in India had intimated that he must have these battalions atonce, partly because of the unrest in India and partly owing to thecondition of the British troops now out there, a number of whom were Territorials and due to return to this country.Lord Curzon asked whether the War Office attached more importance to obtaining more accommodation for the troops on thelower decks, or to the direct journey without transhipment.The Quartermaster-General replied that he thoaght it was moreimportant that the troops should not be disturbed during the journey.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he had heard a gooddeal from various sources regarding the question of the transport ofsoldiers to India, and in his opinion it was one of the main causes of unrest. The men knew more now than they did a few years ago,and asked more questions. The question of accommodation was more grave than people realised, and the question of the accommoda-tion of seamen was now causing much comment.The President of the Board of Trade said that, although hesympathised with the importance of comfortable accommodation forthe men, he thought the necessity of getting our trade routes runningagain had been lost sight of. It was not a question of just thisactual voyage, but of adding to the absortion of ships, already great,for the use of soldiers. It was a serious thing to say that ships werenot to be used above 40 per cent, of their capacity when the ShippingController had stated that he could give satisfactory accommodationfrom Egypt onwards. The Government had an anxious situation to face regarding tonnage from now to the end of the year, and he urged the War Cabinet not to sanction the use of tonnage whichwas not fully justified. He would press that the War Oflice&quot;shouldbe asked to agree to the transhipment of these troops in Egypt,and he could . not see what objection there was to this course ifthe Shipping Controller undertook that the men should be tran-shipped without ever touching land. It would be advisable, how-ever, to inform the troops of the reasons for such a course. Wewere so short of long-range tonnage at the moment that we mustuse every safeguard against the wasting of it.The First Lord of the Admiralty thought that it would be noeconomy in the use of tonnage if a state of feeling was brought about which prevented our having an army at all. He wondered if thecondition of our serving men to-day was realised, and he thought itwas quite probable that some of these men destined for Indiamight refuse to go. He was strongly of opinion that the feeling of the serving men should be our first consideration.The Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies urged thatit was generally better that troops should suffer some discomfort onthe voyage than that repatriation or demobilisation should be delayed.He had come across the question mainly in connection with there patriation of the Dominion troops, and was much impressed by thediscontent and&apos; ill-feeling caused by delay, and thought that theDominions had made the mistake of setting too high a standard of accommodation for their own troops in view of the urgency of repatriation. He saw no reason why transport at Port Said shouldnot be resorted to if it in any way saved tonnage or acceleratedrepatriation.
- 104.WC 584The Shipping Controller said that, provided the War office would reduce the number of their battalions to between 600 and 800men, he would be willing to provide two ships a week and a continuousvoyage.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Shipping Controller and the War Office should confer on the basis of providing two ships a week for thetransport of troops to India ;(o.) The complement of each ship should be   approximately50 per cent, below the ordinary rate ;(c.) The  voyage  from  this   country  to   India   should   becontinuous.Operations in 4. The Deputy Chief of the General Staff informed the WarRussia. Cabinet   that   the present minor   operations   which   were   being conducted by General Ironside in North Russia were connected withminesweeping only, and did not in any way form part of the majoroperation which it was proposed that this General should carry outin North Russia at a later date.GovernmentWireless stations at Leafield andAbu Zabal.5. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby Lord Milner giving the views of the Imperial communications committee on a proposal to complete the Government wireless stations at Leafield, near Oxford, and Abu Zabal, near Cairo(Paper G.T.-7518).Mr. Piling worth said that it was very desirable that theproposal should be approved. The Government were at the momentengaged in a lawsuit with the Marconi Company involving a matterof some 7,000,0001. damages, and it might have a considerable effectif, by deciding at once to complete the stations in question, theGovernment were to show that they could do without the assistanceof the Marconi Company. Moreover, there was a great deal of congestion in the cables to Egypt, and this would be relieved by thecompletion of the Leafield and Abu Zabal Wireless Stations.Colonel amery said that Lord Milner felt very strongly thatthe proposal ought to be approved. Lord Milner&apos;s view was thatthe completion of the Leafield and Abu Zabal Stations was justified on its own and quite apart from any general scheme. The fact ofthe scheme being approved would put our representatives at Parisin a stronger position to demand the allocation to Great Britain ofsuitable wave-lengths, and also, the proposed service would providea nucleus of personnel for the bigger Imperial scheme of wireless stations which would come later.The War Cabinet decided that The recommendations of the Imperial Communications Com-mittee for the immediate completion of the Leafield and.   Abu Zabal Stations should be approved.Repatriation of 6. With reference to War Cabinet 509, Minute 4, the WarChinese Coolies. Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum from the Ministryof Shipping (Paper G.T.-7541) again pressing for the repatriation of chinese coolies, of whom there were at present about 80,000 now inFrance. The Memorandum stated that the position as regardsshipping was as set forth in paragraph 1 of another Memorandum ofthat Department, dated the 28th November, 1918 (Paper G.T.-6399),and, in addition, a vessel was shortly due at Marseilles on her way[826]-751 D
back to Hong-Kong. This vessel had accommodation for 2,000coolies, and if these were not carried the ship would proceed with her space unused. The Memorandum accordingly submitted thatarrangements should be made to release coolies for shipment to Chinaat the rate of 5,000 or 6,000 per month, and that, in particular, stepsbe taken to provide immediately 2,000 coolies for embarkation atMarseilles on the steamship &quot; Nile.&quot;The Quartermaster-General said that the Secretary of State forWar had gone into this question most carefully with his military advisers, and had come to the conclusion that the repatriation of chinese coolies from France was practically impossible at the present justice for the following reasons : In the first place, there was an enormous mass of warlike material and stores which had to be packedup and loaded for despatch to England. In the second place, as itwould appear that the Germans propose to sign tbe Treaty of Peace,it would be necessary for us to repatriate German prisoners of war who might otherwise have been utilised for the purpose of dealingwith this material. In fact, so far from being able to dispense withChinese coolies, the War Office had considered the possibility ofincreasing the number of those already in France. If it was decidedto reduce the number they had, it would involve jettisoning a large amount of material, which would mean a considerable loss to theGovernment.&apos;The Shipping Controller said that he thought that a certainproportion of the coolies in France were employed in unloadingBritish imports into that country. As the flow of British exportsinto France was steadily diminishing he had assumed that theservices of a large number of coolies might now be dispensed with.Shipping was still very scarce, and he strongly urged that the shipnow returning to Hong Kong should not proceed empty on her way,as this would mean the loss of 30,000Z. to 40,0O0Z.The Quartermaster-General pointed out that many of thesecoolies were used in connection with an extensive cross-Channelbarge service, which was not under the Shipping Controller.The First Lord of the Admiralty hoped that the Chinese coolieswould not be repatriated, as he feared that this would mean that theWar Office would make large demands upon civilian labour in thiscountry, to the detriment of agricultural interests.Lord Curzon reminded the Cabinet that, when they had last discussed this questiou, on the 4th December, 1918, the PrimeMinister had expressed himself in favour of the gradual repatriation of Chinese coolies.After a brief discussion, the War Cabinet decided that  Two thousand Chinese cooliesnow in France should be embarked onthe steamship &quot; Nile,&quot; which was shortly due at Marseilles,and sent back to China ; the War Office to make thenecessary arrangements without delay, in concert with theController of Shipping.West Indian Court 7. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theof Appeal Bill. Secretary of State for the Colonies (Paper G.T.-7526), covering thedraft of a Bill to provide for the establishment of a Court of appeal for certain of the West Indian Colonies, which it was thought desirable to pass during the present Session of Parliament. TheMemorandum stated that the proposal had been under consideration for some years, and assumed a definite shape as the result of an inter-Colonial Conference held at Trinidad early in 1916. Thepresent draft had been submitted to, and concurred in by, the variousadministrations concerned, and applied to the colonies of trinidad and Tobago, British Guiana, Barbados, Leeward Islands, Grenada,St. Lucia, and St. Vincent, where provision was made for the additionof any other colony by Order in Council..
9WO 584  105The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the colonies said that it was desirable that the War Cabinet should sanction theintroduction of this Bill at an early date.The War Cabinet decided To approve the draft of the Bill and of its early introduction inParliament.State Grant-in-aid of MaintenanceAllowances forPupils attendingPlaces of higher education.8. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the President of the Board of Education (Paper G.T-.-7452)stating that when the Education Act of 1918 was in Committee a gooddeal was said, especially by members of the Labour Party, as to thenecessity for more general and adequate provision of maintenanceallowances to enable poor and promising children to follow courses of higher education. The local Education authorities had for sometime had power to provide scholarships for children over the age, of12, and a provision was inserted in the Act of 1918 declaring thatthe power to provide scholarships included a power to providemaintenence allowances. A great deal of money spent out of ratesand taxes on the provision of Secondary Schools and other institutions of higher education, was thrown away because many of&apos;the pupilsthat attended them stayed for so short a time. It was urged thatthe mischief of leaving school prematurely was largely due toinsufficiency and uneven provision of maintenance allowances.The President of the Board of Education said what he proposedin his Memorandum was that a State grant, at the rate of 50 percent, of expenditure incurred by Local Education Authorities under arrangements;, approved by the board, for providing maintenanceallowances tenable at institutions of higher education, should beestablished; the total grant in each area not to exceed the sum of3s. per head of the children in the area who are attending public elementary schools. Under this limit the State expenditure couldnot exceed 787,500Z. On basis of the present expenditure it was estimated that the grant might in the first year amount to &quot;250,000LIt was useless to provide courses of higher education unless thosewho began them were enabled to complete them, while from apolitical point of view it was very desirable that the grant should beestablished without delay. Mr. Fisher said that he had discussed the question with the Cbancellor of the Exchequer who had been,favourable to his proposal, but had said that he would be unable togrant a supplementary estimate for the purpose this year. He(Mr. Fisher) regarded his proposal as forming an integral part of thegeneral educational joolicy of His Majesty&apos;s Government. What he asked the War Cabinet to do that morning was to affirm theprinciple of Government aid in providing maintenance allowances tothe extent of the aforesaid 50 per cent., leaving the question of theestimate until the following year.The Joint Financial Secretary to the Treasury said thatthe Chancellor of the Exchequer had proceeded that morning to scotland, and he had had no opportunity of discussing the question with him before he left, so he was not in a position to state definitelywhat Mr. Chamberlains views were, but he felt sure that theChancellor would not be unsympathetic to the recognition of theprinciple urged by the President of the Board of Education.The War Cabinet decided To affirm the principle that State aid at the rate of 50 per cent,of the expenditure incurred by Local Education authorities for the provision of maintenance allowances tenable atinstitutions of higher education, be accepted as forming part of the educational policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government,
2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 24, 1919.and authorised the President of the Board of Education tomake a statement in Parliament in this sense, on theunderstanding that there should be no change on this year&apos;estimates.
