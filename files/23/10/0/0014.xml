With reference to &quot;War Cabinet 556, Minute 5, the WarCabinet took note of the Minister of Labour&apos;s concurrence in theproposals of the Secret Service Committee (Paper G.T.-7085).2. The Wrar Cabinet had under consideration a Note by lord robert Cecil to Mr. Balfour and the Prime Minister on the censorship of cables and wireless (Paper G.T.-7242), urging thatthe time had come for the removal of the censorship on cablesand wireless between the United Kingdom and the rest of europe and America, although, in view of the disturbed conditions inEgypt and India, it might be necessary to maintain it with regardto the East. The paper stated that, under present conditions, theblockade value of the censorship was negligible, while the commer-cial reasons for removing the censorship were very strong. lord robert Cecil therefore pressed that it should be removed withoutdelay. Appended to the Note was an endorsement by Mr. Balfourto the effect that he agreed with its contents, and a note by the[826J--626B
2Prime Minister&apos;s Private Secretary saying.that Mr. Lloyd Georgeaccepted Mr. Balfour&apos;s decision on the subject.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thoughtthat the Cabinet were faced) with a very serious situation. Onthe one hand, Lord Robert Cecil had secured the consent of theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister tothe removal of the censorship. On the other hand, both he himself,in his capacity as head for the time being of the Foreign Office,the First Lord of die Admiralty, and the Secretary of State forWar, were convinced that to adopt Lord Robert&apos;s recommenda-tions would have the gravest possible results. Lord Curzon thenproceeded to indicate what these. results would be, and stated at length the powerful arguments in favour of maintaining the censorship, which had appealed to himself and his colleaguesabove mentioned: Peace had not yet been signed, and he urgedmost strongly that the organisation which had been patientlybuilt up since the commencement of the war, and which had been of incalculable value, should not be broken up.The Secretary of State&apos;for War explained the present prac-tice, and the powers under which Government departments were entitled to act. Peace negotiations to-day had reached a most critical stage, and he agreed with the Acting Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs that it would be disastrous at the present timeto abolish the censorship.The Acting President of the Board of Trade said that themaintenance of the censorship was having a very prejudicial anddetrimental effect upon our trade. The use of private codes was still refused. The delay and uncertainty caused by the censorshipgave rise to very great irritation in commercial circles, and theactual results were reported to be very serious. The amount oftime which it now took to get replies from the East hampered ourcotton merchants to such an extent that the trade was slippingaway from them, and it was largely due to this that there was somuch unemployment in Lancashire.The Postmaster-General said that at present there were sevenor eight official codes which were allowed to be used, but noprivate codes weie permitted. Were this embargo withdrawnmuch delay would be obviated, and the cables would be relieved tothe extent of at least 20 per cent. aThe Secretary of State for War saw no danger in concedingthe use of private codes, and thought it could be done without detriment to military interests. He suggested that the WarCabinet should decide that it was not possible to relax the censor-ship at the present time, but that it might be feasible when we reached a less critical period in the world&apos;s affairs.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed, so long as copiesof the codes were deposited with the Postmaster-General. TheForeign Office, the Admiralty, and the War Office could safeguardtheir own interests by instructing the Postmaster-General to send to them copies of all messages of doubtful origin or character.The lines were now heavily oongested, and the use of private codeswould afford considerable relief. He enquired whether copies ofthe coded message were sent to the addressee before being decodedby the Censor&apos;s Department, or whether they had to be decodedfirst.Colonel Lord Arthur Browne described briefly the system ofdecoding and censoring cables. In reply to the Chancellor of theExchequer, he said that messages were decoded before copies were sent to the addressee, but this seldom involved a delay of morethan an hour. It was true that delays of 10 to 12 days occurred in the transit of messages from abroad, but these were notattributable to the censorship, but mainly to the large amount otGovernment traffic massing over the wires, and consequent con-gestion. He pointed out that if the censorship were abolished itwould be impossible to exclude German traffic, which before the
? W.C. 566war had fully occupied five special lines, and the present con-gestion consequently would be accentuated instead of relieved.Mr. Bonar Law thought that there was some point in the con-tention that the present moment was not opportune for abolishing the censorship&apos;. On the other hand, they were anxious to relieve the situation so far as might be possible. It was essential to. get back to normal conditions without delay, and to get our tradegoing. His sympathies therefore were with those who desired toremove the censorship. On the other hand, he had been impressed by Lord Curzon&apos;s and Mr. Churchill&apos;s arguments against thiscourse. He agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer thatrelief might be afforded if the use of private codes were permitted,subject to the proviso that copies were deposited with the PostOffice,The Parliamentary TJnder-Secretary for Foreign Affairs saidthat pressure had been brought to bear by the Americans in Parisupon our delegates there to induce them to abolish the censorshipas part of the general American movement for abolishing theBlockade. They had done their best to achieve this for a consider-able time past.The Postmaster-General said, with reference to a point raisedearlier in the discussion, that he had consulted the legal authori-ties of the General Post Office over the telephone, and was informedthat no special legislation would be required in order to extend tocables the same powers the Government had in regard to letters in times of emergency.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs did notthink that the War Cabinet were sufficiently conversant with thetechnical details of the subject to reach a satisfactory decision that morning on a question which was really of first-rate impor-tance. He suggested that Sir Auckland Geddes should be invitedto assemble a small conference of departmental experts to tracethe causes of delay and to make proposals.The Acting President of the Board of Trade said that hewould undertake to make this enquiry if the Cabinet so desired.He confessed, however, that he was quite unable to understand what was holding matters up. Both the Foreign Office and theWar Office stated that in a short time there would be no furtherinterference with trade; in the meantime they had, in his view,sufficient powers under the Defence of the Realm Act to securewhat they desired.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs againurged that the Cabinet should be further enlightened in regardto technical details, and reminded them, that we could not abolish the censorship without the consent of the French and the Italians.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) Sir Auckland Geddes should enquire into the present\ working of the censorship, report the resulf to theCabinet at an early date, and&apos; make recommendations as to the policy the Cabinet should adopt.(&amp;.) Until Sir Auckland Geddes had concluded his enquiry,no action should be taken on Lord Robert Cecil&apos;s paper.The War Cabinet took note that, by agreement with theFrench and Italian Governments, His Majesty&apos;s Government couldnot abolish the censorship without reference to our Allies.Pay and Conditions 3. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumof Service in the by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Paper G.T.-7227), drawingArmy, Navy, and attention to the following decision arrived at by the Soldiers&apos;Air Force. and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee at their 49th meeting: :&quot; To draw the urgent attention of the Chancellor of theExchequer to the necessity of correlating the conditions of[S26]-626 B 2
service in the Navy, the Army, and the Air Force, and to-recommend that for this purpose a permanent Committee,composed as under, should be set up to bring into uniformitythe whole question of the pay, allowances, pensions, and cash, emoluments of all kinds of the three Services.&quot;A Representative of the Treasury (in the Chair),&quot;A Representative of the Admiralty,&quot;A Representative of the War Office,&quot;A Representative of the Air Ministry,&quot;A Representative of the Ministry of Pensions.&quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer in his Memorandum saidthat he agreed with the recommendation of the Pay Committee,,and hoped that it would be adopted by the War Cabinet.The Minister of Reconstruction said that suggestions were constantly coming up before the Pay Committee which were merelya mass of detail. None of the departments immediately concerned had been consulted on the proposals put forward, with the resultthat decisions bad to be arrived at without sufficient preliminary examination. A great deal of time and money would be saved ifthere were in existence a joint departmental machine which would co-ordinate the proposals of the different fighting Services before these were put forward to Ministers, instead of their being first of all submitted to Ministers and then referred to departmentalexperts for examination.The Secretary of State for War said that he was entirelyopposed to the suggestion, which would have the effect of limiting the responsibility of the, various departments and the Ministers incharge. The position at present was that the War Cabinet hadgranted the Admiralty proposals for the pay of the Navy, and itwas for the War Office to consider departmentally how those-proposals affected the pay of the post-war Army and Air Force.When the War Office proposals were ready for submission to the-War Cabinet they could not agree to have them hung up for examination by the proposed Committee. The right method ofprocedure, in his opinion, was that the Ministers at the heads ofthe departments concerned should meet in consultation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded the Secretary ofState for War that, when the Jerram proposals were before theCabinet, he (Mr. Churchill) bad expressed the view that the con-cessions granted to the Admiralty, and the circumstances in whichthe Jerram Report had been presented, would prejudice the pro-posals to be put forward by the War Office and Air Ministry forthe rates of pay of the post-war Army and Air Force respectively.The alternative suggestion of the Secretary of State for War, thatthe only consultation on proposals put forward by departments should be between the heads of the departments, would give riseto the same condition of affairs as had occurred in the case of theJerram Report. The proposals would be brought to the cabinet for a decision at very short notice, and there would be no timeto look into the question thoroughly. It was essential that ministers should have the advice of their permanent officials before!deciding large questions of policy, and it was impossible now tocontinue the war-time practice of departments bringing largeschemes, entailing huge sums of money, to be decided upon bythe War Cabinet before examination by departmental experts.Some continuous machinery should be arranged.The Minister of Reconstruction, in reply to Mr, Bonar Law,,said, that the proposal was that the Committee should examine-schemes put forward by the departments before they were sub--mitted to Ministers for final decision.The Financial Secretary to the Admiralty said that the sug-gestion made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer was not thesame as the recommendation of the  Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay
W.C. 566Committee, which had expressly stated that the proposed Com-mittee should be set up to bring into uniformity the conditions ofservice in the Navy, Army, and Air Force. That was impossible,,as the Services were entirely different, and uniformity was a sug-gestion to which the Board of Admiralty would never agree. TheChancellor of the Exchequer, however, in his Memorandum had referred to &quot;the need for continuous machinery for consultation between the departments immediately concerned, in order toprevent changes being made by one Service from taking a formunnecessarily injurious to the interests of another.&quot; This was really ,a different suggestion from that of the Pay Committee, andhe thought the Board of Admiralty would be prepared to acceptthe appointment of a Committee with Terms of Referenda suchas these, provided that the differences between the three services were not ignored. He did not think, however, that a Treasuryofficial should be in the Chair.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was preparedto accept Dr. macnamara&apos;s suggestion for the Terms of Referenceto the proposed Committee, except as regards the question of theChairman.The War Cabinet then had a discussion on the constitution and functions of such a Committee as it was proposed to set up.On the one hand, it was urged that the creation of an outside bodyof this kind would derogate from the responsibility of theMinisters as heads of departments. If such a Committee were necessary, it could be set up ad hoc, and the Minister directly responsible should take the initiative in such a matter. It was preferable that any such Committee should consist of the ministers concerned rather than of the permanent officials. It was con-tended, on the other hand, that Ministers did not have the specialist knowledge necessary to examine in detail financial pro-posals which, while put forward by one department, might seriously react on the conditions of. others. The object of the pro-posed Committee was (1) To prevent things being done inignorance which with a fuller knowledge would not be done;(2) To reduce controversial points to a minimum before submission-sion to Ministers. It was essential, in order to save Ministers&apos;time and public money, that &quot;any proposals should be examined bydepartmental experts before being finally submitted to the WarCabinet for decision.Lord Curzon said that a Committee, set up as suggested inthe last paragraph of the Chancellor of the Exchequers Memo-ran dum (Paper G.&quot;T.-7227), would be of the greatest service tothe War Cabinet. He would suggest, however, that the Terms ofReference should be carefully drafted by the Chancellor of theExchequer, and that the Chairman of the Committee should bethe senior civil servant appointed to serve on it.\\     After further discussion, the War Cabinet decided-To adopt Lord Curzon&apos;s suggestion, namely :(a.) That a Committee, comprising representatives of theTreasury, Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry, and ministry of Pensions, should be set up for the purposeoutlined in the last paragraph of the Chancellor of the exchequers Memorandum, namely, &quot; for consultation between the departments immediately concerned, inorder to prevent changes made by one Service from taking a form unnecessarily injurious to the interestsof another.&apos;&apos; -(b.) That the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Seore-tary of State for War, should draw up the Terms ofReference of this Committee.A
(c.) That the Chairman of the Committee should be the senior&quot;civil servant appointed to serve on the Committee.General Licence for 4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theImports from the Acting President of the Board of Trade (Paper G.T.-7230)British Empire. regarding the General Licence for Imports from the BritishEmpire. The Memorandum stated that it was announced in theHouse of Commons in March last that no import restrictions would be, or continue to be, imposed on goods coming from anypart of the Empire, which were the produce or manufacture ofHis Majesty&quot;s dominions, without the special consent of theCabinet in each case. In accordance with this a general licencewas issued to the Customs, permitting the importation into theUnited Kingdom of all articles on the list of prohibited importswhen they were exported from, or were the produce or manufac-ture of, any part of the Empire. It was announced at the sametime that, for the time being, this general licence would notapply to (a.) Gold or articles containing gold, except when consigneddirect to the Bank of England.(.&amp;.) Spirits, other than brandy and rum.(c.) Hops.Since the issue of this general licence circumstances had altered, making it no longer necessary to continue the exceptions(a) and (b).  It was, however, proposed to retain (c).,The War Cabinet were therefore asked (1.) To ratify the steps already taken by the Board of Trade.(2.) To approve that hops should be continued as an exception to the general licence.(3.) To authorise the Board of Trade to exercise their dis-cretion in interpreting the phrase &quot;produce or manu-facture of His Majesty&apos;s dominions.&quot;The War Cabinet approved of the above proposals.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,May 13, 1919.o
