The  Chancellor  of  the  Exchequer requested the Warand British Pro- Cabinet to consider, as a matter of urgency, the position of certaintectorates. territories in relation to the system of Imperial Preference pro-posed in the Budget. It was proposed to include within the area to which Preference would be extended His Majesty&apos;s Dominionsoutside the United Kingdom, together with countries under british protection, and India, and would incidentally raise thequestion of Egypt and the Sudan. It was also proposed that if,at some future date, a mandate should be granted in respect ofany territory on the terms that it should come within the customs union of the mandated territory, His Majesty should have power,[826]-631 - B-A
by Order in Council, to direct that Preference should be extendedto that territory.Lord Curzon said that it was necessary to be very careful inthe use of the terms &quot; Protection &quot; and &quot; Protectorate.&quot; In thecase of Mesopotamia, the country would certainly be under a mandate, but it would in no sense be a British Protectorate, andgreat care had been taken to maintain the distinction in terms.Countries under a mandate would be under the League ofNations.Mr. Bonar Law suggested that the rationale of the distinction should be whether a country came under the Customs Union ofthe mandatory State; for example, German South-West Africa.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that His Majesty&apos;sDominions did not include such territories as the Native Statesand the Malay States. It was therefore necessary to. insert theexpression &quot; territory,under His Majesty&apos;s protection.&quot;Lord Curzon said that the use of that expression would not involve the inclusion of Egypt. Egypt was not, strictly speaking,at present under the protection of Great Britain. The Protec-torate declared at the beginning of the War would not be effectiveuntil it had been recognised by other foreign Powers. At presentrecognition had been made by France and the United States ofAmerica. Recognition was part of the Peace Treaty which wasbeing enforced on Germany and would be enforced on Turkey. Itwould also have to be made by the neutral Powers, and egypt would then fall under the heading of those States which subse-quently came under British protection.The War Cabinet decided that Imperial Preference should be extended to such territories as are now included in His Majesty&apos;s Dominions or are under His Majesty&apos;s protection, and that there should bepower, by Order in Council, to . extend the system ofImperial Preference to any countries which in futuremight come under British protection, or in respect ofwhich a mandate was granted to any portion of theBritish Empire, of such a nature that the mandated territory came within the Customs Union of the manda-tory country.Proposed Loan to 2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that representativesOmsk Government, of the firm of Barings were prepared to grant a loan of  9,000,000to the Omsk Government, provided that the Treasury approved,on the understanding that no part of the money should be spentoutside Europe. The Treasury had no objection on financial grounds, and presumably the Cabinet would not wish to offeropposition. The object of the loan would be to restart theexchanges between Russia and Europe, and to pay for materialsobtained in Europe. The Russians were acting through M. Bark,who was co-operating with the Sazonoff group.The War Cabinet decided that They had no objection to the proposed loan.British Officers and 3. The  Chancellor  of  the Exchequer drew  attention toIISbST ^oreiSn Office telegram No. 433 of the 9th May, 1919 fromMr. Robertson, His Majesty&apos;s Representative at Vladivostok, mwhich it was stated that Mr. Hodgson, at Omsk, bad spoken to admiral Kolchak on the subject of the proposed formation of a russian Brigade at Ekaterinburg, with British officers and non-commissioned officers Admiral Kolchak was strongly m favourof the proposal, and, Mr. Hodgson presumed that, on political
3WC 567    &apos; 47grounds, there would be no objection to the project, whichemanated from General Knox, of allowing British officers to figthtwith the Russians, that being the only logical step beyond allowingthem to train Russian soldiers. It was evident that this would commit His Majesty7s Government to more definite support, ofthe Omsk Government than had hitherto been given. Mr.Chamberlain stated that the Cabinet had merely sanctioned theloan of officers for the piufpose of training, and the proposals inthe telegram went beyond anything which had yet been approved.He saw grave danger, if British officers became involved in fighting, of our being obliged to go to their support in the eventof their being in difficulty.Lord Curzon said that the proposal was closely connectedwith recognition of the Omsk Government. The Foreign office had come to the conclusion that the time had now arrived forrecognising that Government, and were in favour of according itrecognition as the Provisional Government of Siberia. admiral kolchak, on the other hand, desired his Government to be recog-nisedas the Government of all Russia. The American Govern-ment had hitherto opposed recognition, but he gathered, froma conversation he had recently had with Mr. Lansing, thatthe American Government were now disposed to reconsider theirattitude.The War Cabinet decided that The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should examine the proposals contained in the telegram, in con-, sultation with the Secretary of State for War, andshould call the attention of the British representatives in Paris to them.Women&apos;s Emanci- L The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention to thepation Bill. urgent necessity for considering the position in relation to theWomen&apos;s Emancipation Bill, raised in a Memorandum submittedby him on the 8th May (Paper G.T.-7239), in which-he had drawn. attention to the serious consequences that would follow if the bill were passed into law in its present form. The Bill was that morning being taken in Committee in the House of Commons, andthe matter was therefore urgent. For example, the effect of clause 1 would be to throw open to women every post in the IndianCivil Service.The Acting Secretary stated that the Bill had been referredito the Committee of Home Affairs.Mr. Fisher stated that he understood that the President ofthe Local Government Board, who was in charge of the Govern-ment case for the Committee, intended to oppose Clause 1. Hewould take an opportunity of seeing Dr. Addison on the subject.Forestry Bill 5. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby Dr. H. A. L. Fisher (Paper G.T.-7194), together with a letterfrom the Chairman of the Interim Forestry Authority (paper g.T.-7215), and a revised draft of the Forestry Bill (paper g.T.-6913A).The President of the Board of Education, speaking as chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, said that the ForestryBill, which had been referred by Mr. Bonar Law to the HomeAffairs Committee, found little favour among members of theHome Affairs Committee, on the following grounds: (1) The. powers vested in the new Forestry Authority were too extensive,particularly in respect of the proposal to aid private individualsby way of loan, or grant and to subsidise education and researchat the universities; (2) The Bill differentiated between Ireland
and the rest of the United Kingdom, provision being made for thepower to transfer by Order in Council to the Forestry Commis-sioners the forestry powers now vested in the English and ScottishBoards of Agriculture, and no such provision being made in thecase of Ireland; further, while the power of the development commission to assist Forestry in England and Scotland was to betaken away, it was to be continued in Ireland. In view of the unfavourable reception of the Bill in the Home Affairs Committee,he had thought it necessary to refer it back to the War Cabinet.It was clear that it wouldbe difficult to get support for the Billamong the departments, and particularly the Scottish Office. Hehad accordingly asked Mr. Acland to introduce amendments intothe Bill in order, as far as possible, to meet the principal objec-tions to it. Mr. Acland had submitted a new draft, which,provided for uniformity of treatment in all three countries,eliminated the transfer of powers by Order in Council, andempowered the Forestry Commissioners by agreement to carry out their executive functions through the Boards of Agriculture inScotland and England, as well as through the Department ofAgriculture and Technical Instruction in Ireland. He could not say whether the amendments proposed would meet the objectionsfelt by the Secretary for Scotland. The real question for decision was whether it was desirable to have a Forestry Authority armed with the power of carrying out a forestry policy in the three countries either through the instrumentality of the Boards ofAgriculture &quot;or, if necessary, independently of them.Lord Curzon stated that the President of the Board of Educa- ,tion had put forward a case that had already been more than once discussed and decided by the Cabinet. In the spring of1P1S, there being a complete impasse in the proposals for setting up a Forestry Authority, the War Cabinet had decided(War Cabinet 360; Minute 17, and War Cabinet 411, Minute 7)to refer the matter to Mr. Barnes and himself, with full authority to settle it. After many sittings and the hearing of evidence of all shades of opinion, including experts in scottish Forestry, the Committee decided, although they had full power to settle the matter, to refer back to the Cabinet,or. account of the views of the Secretary for Scotland, towhom it was a matter of great moment. The Committee reportedin favour of creating a strong central Forestry Authority, and put forward two solutions, the first of which the constitution ofa new central Forestry Authority was regarded as much to be preferred. As an inferior alternative it was suggested to set upa branch of the Development Commission as the Forestry&apos;&apos;Authority. The point was taken that it might be difficult tO&apos;carry out the first proposal in Parliament, and at Mr. bonar law&apos;s suggestion the matter was referred to Sir George Youngerand Mr. Pratt to obtain the opinion of the Scottish members. Mr.Pratt reported that the majority of the Scottish members werenot unfavourable to the more ambitious scheme. The Cabinetthereupon decided to adopt the Committee&apos;s first suggestion (WarCabinet 455, Minute 15). The Secretary for Scotland maintainedhis objections at each stage. The decision of the Governmentwas announced in both Houses of Parliament, and a sum of 100,000 was Voted for taking the preliminary steps to set up an interim Authority, with Mr. Acland as Chairman. A Bill hadbeen drafted by Mr. Acland to give effect to the War Cabinefspobcy, but, in view of the objections raised on the details by theBoard of Agriculture and the Scottish Office, the matter was referred to the Home Affairs Committee, the Cabinet beingoccupied with other matters at that time. There were on theHome Affairs Committee several Ministers who were opposed tothe Barnes-Curzon Report, and there was no one there to advocate the case for the Report. He was therefore not surprised that theCommittee had been unable to support the Bill.  The Home Affairs
5WC 50748Committee had already referred the Bill back to the Cabinet for confirmation of the principle of a central Forestry Authority, andthe Cabinet had confirmed their previous decision (War Cabinet549, Minute 3). The result of the present disagreement was thatthe Cabinet were back again in the same position as they were before he and Mr. Barnes undertook their investigation. If theCabinet were to reverse the whole of their policy they would lose their Bill, the forestry experts would resign the appointments theyhad consented to fill, and great opposition would be raised,possibly in the House of Commons and certainly in the House ofLords.Mr. Chamberlain said that departmentally it was immaterialwhether there was a central authority for, the United kingdom or a separate authority for the three countries, but the Bill in itspresent form was the worst possible compromise, involvingseparate local authorities for the executive work, with a centralauthority superimposed. Consequently a dual expert staffthroughout would be necessary.Sir Auckland Geddes admitted that he was responsible forfocussing criticism in the Home Affairs Committee upon the Bill,as originally drafted. It was very much better in its present form. The original Bill would have involved duplication of the research Authority, the Education Authority, and the Develop -ment Authority, with the consequent waste and overlapping. Ittreated the United Kingdom as a unit, whereas from the point ofview of forestry it fell naturally into the three national divisions.Forestry in Scotland was a much bigger industry than in England,and he strongly urged that the best solution was to put forestryunder the -Development Commission for the purpose of advising the Treasury on finance, and to leave the practical work to bedone by the national authorities.Lord Curzon said that this would involve throwing overeverything that had been done. All the arguments put forwardnow had been considered by Mr. Barnes and himself. In every country where forestry had been successful it had been controlled by a central authority, conspicuously in India, where the system with which he was familiar had worked admirably. If it were placed under the Development Commission it would be starvedand side-tracked.Mr. Bonar Law said that he was quite sure the PrimeMinister would regard the solution proposed by Sir auckland geddes as out of the question.Mr. Munro said that the last thing be desired was to frustrate the decision of the War Cabinet. He-had defended the Govern-ment policy in the House of Commons, and he had given every possible support to Mr. Acland in connection with the InterimForestry Authority. The Report of the Barnes-Curzon Com-mittee was considered by the Cabinet, in his recollection, in theabsence of representatives of the departments concerned. Whenthe Bill came before the Home Affairs Committee the matter was regarded by Sir Auckland Geddes as open for reconsideration,and in this view the Committee concurred.Mr. Fisher interposed that he was in favour, of a centralauthority, but the feeling of the Home Affairs Committee was so strong that it was impossible to proceed.Mr. Munro said that he was in favour of a central body, butobjected to the transfer of the executive powers of the Depart-ments to it, and was certain that the Scottish members would sharehis objection.Mr. Bonar Law interposed] that Sir George Younger hadtaken the view that there would be a great deal of opposition, but.did riot think it would be so serious as was feared.Mr. Munro, continuing, said that the forestry powers of theScottish Board of Agriculture had only been granted in 1913, and,in consequence of the War,,they had had neither money nor staff.[826]-631C
They had therefore no time in which to justify their policy inregard to forestry. The present position was impossible. as secretary for Scotland he was responsible by statute for forestrywork which was in fact being carried out by the InterimAuthority. The proposal to transfer the powers from the scottish board of Agriculture would divorce forestry from agriculture.The matter having been reopened in the Home Affairs Committee,he felt at liberty to discuss it, but would, of course, conform tothe decision of the Cabinet.Lord Ernie said that he regarded as essential a CentralForestry Authority to dictate the policy to be carried out by thethree separate Departments. He strongly objected to differentia-tion between Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. he approved the Bill in its revised form, subject to an amendmentof Section 3, Sub-section 2, in order to provide that any Depart-ment from which powers and duties in relation to forestry were transferred to the Forestry Commissioners should, if the Depart-ment so desired, continue to exercise and perform on behalf of theCommissioners any of the transferred powers and duties, subjectto such arrangements as might be agreed between the Commis-sioners and the Department, or, in default of agreement, bedetermined by the Treasury.Mr. Chamberlain said that he was all in favour of localaction in matters of this kind, but it was against all principles ofGovernment to reverse a decision come to by Ministers to whomthe matter had been specifically referred for settlement. He sug-gested that power should be conferred on a central authority to inspect, to control, and to make or withhold grants, the grants tobe given with due regard to the possibilities of forestry develop-ment in each country and not to population.Lord Curzon stated that Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s suggestions hadbeen carefully examined and rejected. Mr-. Barnes had written to him emphasising his conviction that the Barnes-Curzon report should be adhered to. He (Lord Curzon) was so anxious that thescheme should work successfully that he was prepared to give amajority of the appointments on the Forestry Commission to scotland..Mr. Fisher drew attention to the fact that the principalalteration in the revised draft Bill was in Clause 3 (2), whichproposed, that, by agreement with the Forestry Commission, theAgricultural Departments in the three countries might continueto exercise forestry powers on behalf of the Commissioners, and pointed out that the central authority required to be in a positionto exercise those powers if the departments failed to do so.After further discussion, Lord Curzon suggested that a Bill,drawn up on the lines of the Barnes-Curzon Report, should beintroduced in the House of Lords. This would give an opportunityto test public opinion.Mr. Bonar Law pointed out that the Government must beprepared to take the responsibility for a definite policy.Mr. Chamberlain agreed, but pointed out that it would be-easier to accept amendments in the House of Lords than it wouldbe after a controversial discussion in the House of Commons.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) They adhered to their decision to constitute a CentralForestry Authority with executive powers.(&amp;.) The Forestry Bill should be introduced in the House ofLords.(c.) The President of the Board of Education and theSecretary for Scotland should confer with theChairman of the Interim Forestry Authority and LordLovat. as to whether the Bill should be introduced inits original or in its revised form, and, in the event of failure to agree, should refer to the Cabinet.
Indian Keforms. 6. With reference to War Cabinet 533, Minute 3, the WarCabinet had under consideration Memoranda by the Secretary ofState for India (G.T.-7243 and G.T.-6698), to the latter of whichwas attached the draft of a BillTo make further provision withrespect to the Government of India.&quot;The Secretary of State for India said that the Bill, whichhad been, drafted some time previously, had been referred to aCabinet Comimittee; and had been revised and considered very carefully by an important Reforms Committee sitting in the india Office. The subject, however, was so technical that it wouldtake the Cabinet a considerable time fully to inform itselfregarding the measure, while he was constantly receiving repre-sentations that the position of affairs in India made imperativethe early introduction of the Bill.( Tie therefore sought generalauthority from the War Cabinet to introduce, a. Bill in the follow-ing month, and to move that it be referred to a select Committeeof both Houses; asking from the Government support for the bill at its second reading. The Bill he proposed to introduce would carry out such parts of the Monfcagu-Chelmsford Report and ofthe Reports of the two Southborough Committees sitting in india as required legislative provision. The segregation of functions and the extension of the franchise would be effected by regulations under the Bill, and would not appear in the Bill itself. It wasthe intention of the India Office, however, to submit a draft of thegeneral policy of the regulations it was proposed to carry out under the Bill to the same Committee as considered the Bill itself,so that they could report to the House of Commons both upon theBill and the regulations.In reply to a question by Lord Curzon, Mr. Montagu saidthat the Bill had been modified, since it was drafted some months ago, in response to a despatch from the Government of India andin view of the opinions of the Local Governments. The principle underlying the Bill, however, was untouched. There was one,and as far as he could see, only one, great point of differencebetween the authorities who had put forward the various schemes.The Mqntagu-Chelmsford Report with regard to Local Govern-ment had recommended a scheme which was generally referred toas diarchy. Certain of the Local Governments were opposed tothis scheme, but the Government of India, which had considered in conference the objections put forward by the Local Govern-ments, had, after careful examination, rejected the alternative schemes suggested by these Governments, and had decided infavour of diarchy.Mr. Bonar Law pointed out that a question so important as this was bound to come up when the Bill was referred to the SelectCommittee. Was he to understand that the Secretary of Statefor India asked the Government to commit themselves, on thesecond reading of the Bill, to the principle of diarchy?The Secretary of State for India explained that at a meetingof the Cabinet Committee, which was attended by the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the President of the Board of Education, and himself, it had been agreed that this principle was the best; andthe Secretary of State for the Colonies, who was also a. memberbut had been unable to be present, had also expressed, his approvalwhen the matter had been explained to him later. With regardto the views of the eight Local Governments in India, Madrasobjected to everything. Of the remaining seven, two were infavour of the principle of diarchy, four were opposed to it, andBombay expressed no opinion. The newly-appointed governor of Bombay was in favour of diarchy.Lord Curzon said that the principle of diarchy was one ofthe chief controversial points in the scheme, and one&apos; to which theformer Governor of Bombay, Lord Willingdon, was entiretyopposed. &apos; While he agreed that the War Cabinet should give theSecretary of State for India authority to introduce a Bill immedi-WC 567
ately, he did not wish to be committed without further and detailed examination to this principle. Radical changes might be madein the Bill when it came before the Select Committee, and he didnot desire to have to support in the House of Lords a principle which possibly the Committee might have rejected.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that after careful con-sideration of the matter he felt strongly that diarchy was the bestforward was a consistent wdiole. The Government, however, mustbe left free to consider impartially whatever report the SelectCommittee might make.The Secretary of State for India said that he had no desire that the Government should commit themselves on this question at this stage. He wdshed the Committee to consider the Bill very carefully and in complete detail. But, without committing theGovernment, he hoped that he would have absolute freedom in moving the second reading to state his own views and to recom-mend as strongly as he could the course of action which he thoughtbest.The War Cabinet decided To authorise the Secretary of State for India to introduce inParliament a Bill on the lines indicated as early as pos-sible; and to move in due course that it be referred toa Joint Committee cf both Houses. The Governmentwrould support the Bill at its second reading on the under-standing that they were not committed thereby to thesupport of the principle of diarchy as regards LocalGovernment, before the Select Committee had reported.But the Secretary of State for India should have absolutefreedom to recommend for the acceptance of the Houseof Commons his own personal views in the matter.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,system of LocalMay 14, 1919.o
