Police Unrest. 1. WITH reference to War Cabinet 544, Minute 1. the WarCabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Home Department (Paper G.T.-7406), in which he statedthat he wished to make an announcement in the House ofCommons, before the Whitsuntide recess, on the Police question,and to disclose the policy it was proposed to pursue.The Home Secretary said that, with regard to the PoliceUnion, he would like to explain to the Plouse exactly what thearrangement was in August last, and then detail how thatarrangement had worked and how it had been treated by theleaders of the Union, adding that such an arrangement could notbe allowed to continue. He and his advisers had been working out a scheme of organisation for the Police, to be managed by themselves within their own body, which would ensure that theinterests of the youngest constable would be completely safe-guarded. Lord Desborough&apos;s Committee was also consideringthe same question, and he wanted to tell the House that it was proposed to place such an organisation on a statutory basis. Hewould like to add, in his statement, that, when the new organisa-tion had been completed, every serving police officer should becalled upon to leave the Police and Prison Servants&apos; Union.The Minister of Labour said that he understood that theLabour Party were going to reply to the home Secretary&apos;s speech that afternoon, and that there would be little opposition on theLabour side, provided the Home Secretary&apos;s proposals werereasonable.Mr. Bonar Law said that the question for decision reallyreduced itself to whether (a) the men should be called upon toleave their Union immediately, or (6) wait until the new organisa-tion, which was being prepared by the Home Secretary, was complete. Pie himself favoured the latter course, but he thoughtit should be made plain that the organisation was in fact a realUnion, but that it would be confined to the Police and would notbe allowed to affiliate itself to any other bodies.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he understood thatstrong feeling existed in the Police Force against the appointmentof Commissioners from outside the Force, and that this caused agood deal of unrest The same feeling existed in the Royal irish constabulary, in which a similar practice obtained. This bodyfelt that the Inspector-Generalship should be given to a man from within the Corps. The home Secretary said that a certainamount of misunderstanding arose on. this point because men whowere trained policemen had now resumed their duties with militarytitles.   He would make some reference to this in his statement.The Under-Secretary for Scotland asked whether thePlome secretary&apos;s announcement would apply to the whole country. The Secretary for Scotland was quite willing that thisshould be so, but would prefer that the question of whether thereshould be one Union for Great Britain or one for England and one for Scotland, should be left open.The Home Secretary said his proposal was intended to applyto the whole country.The War Cabinet approved the statement the HomeSecretarvproposed to make in the House of Commons that after-noon.Employment forDisabledEx-service Men.2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Labour (Paper G.T.-7414) relating to employment for disabled men.The Minister of Labour apologised for giving the War Cabinet-such short notice of this question, but the matter was urgent,inasmuch as he had received alarmist telegrams from the General
Secretary of the Discharged Soldiers&apos; Association intimating thatthere was to be a general meeting of the Association in Manchesteron Sunday next, that great difficulty had been found in dealingwith the extremists, and that it was feared that violence mightbe resorted to unless an assurance could be given that theGovernment was giving its earnest attention to the needs ofdisabled ex-service men. In his Memorandum he asked for authority (a.) To initiate immediately a national scheme under which employers would be asked to give an undertaking tofind work for as many disabled men as possible, but inno case less than 5 per cent, of their totpl staff.Employers who signed such an undertaking would begiven a certificate to that effect by the Ministry ofLabour, and would be authorised to stamp theirstationery with an official die.(5.) To take steps to secure a resolution of the House ofCommons to deal with the employment of disabled menby Government contractors, somewhat on the lines ofthe &quot; fair wages clause.&quot;(c.) To announce that the Government would give a lead by undertaking to employ 5 per cent, of disabled men bothin the Government service and in Government indus-trial establishments.(d.) To arrange with the Treasury for a circular to be issued to all Government Dejsartments with regard to theemployment, in substitution for women holdingtemporary posts, of men Avho have served in the Forces.(e.) To issue an instruction to Employment Exchanges thates-Service men were to have a preference, other thingsbeing equal, over civilian labour in being offeredvacancies.With regard to proposals (a) and (b), he was advised that itwould be necessary, before putting them into practice, to obtainthe approval of the Trade Unions; otherwise, if the Governmentdismissed a fit man in order to make room for a disabled man, itmight result in strikes. He did not anticipate putting the first two proposals into operation until trade union assent had beenobtained. With regard to proposal (d), he thought somethingwould have to be done, inasmuch as it was asserted that there were many women holding Government posts who did not require this form of income at all and many of the women were married and could be supported by their husbands. Great irritation w*as felton this point by discharged officers, who were now in a mostdeplorable state and were walking the streets in search of employ-ment. He suggested that there should be a census of GovernmentDepartments with regard to the temporary posts in which women were employed. As to proposal (e), he saw no objection to this being carried out.Mr. Sonar Law said that he thought the Cabinet would a^reethat it was necessary to do something on the lines suggested bythe Minister of Labour, but be doubted the feasibility of fixing a figure such as 5 per cent, of disabled men to be employed in theGovernment service and in certain industrial establishments.The Minister of Labour replied that this percentage could be varied either by an application centrally by a trade to the Ministryof Labour, or locally by application of an individual employer tothe Local Employment Committee. He would be prepared tonegotiate on this point with anv trade which desired negotiation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said, with regard toemploying 5 per cent, in Government Departments and in indus-trial establishments he did not know whether it would be possiblefor employers to do this, and he doubted whether it could be
enforced in Government Offices. The Government Offices duringthe war had trained a number of temporary officers, who were nowpossessed of some experience; it would be difficult to replace theseby persons with no experience at all, and might involve an increasein staff and a decrease in efficiency. He understood that theexperience already obtained of demobilised soldiers in GovernmentDepartments was not altogether a happy one. He had not the leastobjection to an enquiry, and thought it would be a good thing ; butat this stage it would be unwise for the Government to commit themselves.The Secretary of State for War said that discharged and disabled soldiers wrere a very difficult class, and one whichnaturally obtained much sympathy throughout the country.There was no limit to what a man, whose nerves had been shatteredby the war, might do. The problem had to be tackled, otherwiseriots of a most painful kind might result. He would like to ask the Minister of Pensions whether a Chelsea Hospital for Scotlandhad been set up. In his opinion there should be a retreat for thesemen, and some place provided for them to which they could go ifthey found the battle of life too strenuous.The Minister of Pensions replied that he had made plans lastFebruary for the setting up of convalescent centres, at which men whose nerves had been shattered during the war could recoup andbe made fit to take their part in the world. Unfortunately, thescheme had not made much progress. At the present momentthere were 600.000 disabled soldiers drawing pensions, and 367,000pensions to &quot;Z &quot; men had been granted since demobilisation.Mr. Bonar Law said that they all felt the urgency of Krisproblem, and it had been put to him with great force by the Kingthe other day. These disabled and discharged soldiers were trying to insist on seeing His Majesty, which, of course, was impossible,but the King was at the present moment making progressesthrough different towns, and a disagreeable incident might arise if a body of these men broke through the police cordonThe Minister of Labour said that the King had intimated his willingness to grant Royal Warrants only to those firms whoemployed 5 per cent, of disabled men.The First Lord of the Admiralty said, with reference to theSecretary of State for War&apos;s suggestion regarding an extension ofthe Chelsea Hospital scheme, that he heartily agreed that some-thing of this kind should be done. The most urgent problem atthe moment was that of the demobilised men, and he thought satis-factory results would follow if hopes could be held out that theChelsea Hospital scheme would be extended.The Minister of Labour said that he thought at the presentmoment he could not make a very satisfactory statement in theHouse, but he would like the War Cabinet to sanction his proposals(a), (b), (d), and (e); (a) and (&amp;) being subject to consultationwith the Trade Unions. With regard to proposal (c), relating to5 per cent, disabled men being employed in the Government serviceand in Government industrial establishments, he suggested thata Departmental Committee should be set up, consisting of repre-sentatives ofThe Treasury,The War Office,The Ministry of Labour.The Ministry of Pensions,to go into the question and to report.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he assumed that,before the Minister of Labour summoned the Committee, he wouldascertain that any women wdio might be dismissed as a result ofthe Committee&apos;s proposals would not swell the ranks of the unem-
,5 WC 577ployed. Some of the women would piobably be found to be widows of officers killed in the War.The War Cabinet decided--(a.) To approve (i.) A scheme being initiated under which employers would be asked to give an undertaking to findwork for as many disabled men as possible, butin no case less than 5 per cent, of their totalstaff;(ii.) The Minister of Labour taking steps to secure aresolution of the House of Commons to ensurethe employment of a certain proportion of dis-abled men by Government contractors;(i) and (ii) being subject to the Minister of Labour&apos;s negotiations wdth the Trade Unions, and to suit-able provision being made to vary the percentagein special cases.(&amp;.) That a Departmental Committee, consisting of represen-tatives of The Treasury,The War Office.The Ministry of Labour,The Ministry of Pensions,should go into the question of the number of establishedposts in Government Departments and the number of temporary posts, and ascertain what percentage of thetotal of temporary posts now filled by temporary menand women could be filled with disabled men, the Com-mittee to be convened by Sir Robert Horne.(c.) That, preference should be given to ex-Service men in theirtrades by the Employment Exchanges in dealing with applications for emplojmient.(d.) That the Ministry of Pensions should consider the ques-tion of an extension of the Chelsea Hospital scheme,and report to the War Cabinet.Increased Supply 3. With reference to War Cabinet 573, Minute 1, the WTarof Beer. Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the Presidentof the Local Government Board (Paper G.T-7409) in which he deprecated the proposed remission of the extra 10s. tax resultantupon the increased barrelage of beer, if the gravity in each gradewere raised 3 degrees without altering the price, on the grounds that this (1) would not lead to the provision of an additional quan-tity of beer; (2) would not lead to any diminution in price; and(3) would not give any security whatever that we should in factget the increased gravity of 3 degrees which it is sought to obtain,and consequently no surety of obtaining any increase of qualitybeyond what it is hoped to obtain by raising the gravity to1040 degrees; and a Memorandum by the Pood Controller (paper g.T.-7397) recommending that the average gravity should beraised to 1043 degrees in Great Britain and to 1050 degrees inIreland.The Food Controller reminded the War Cabinet that he hadbeen requested to negotiate with the brewers on the basis that the gravity of beer in each scale should be increased by 3 degrees, theaverage gravity remaining the same, the Government undertaking,if this were done, to remit the additional tax of 10s. per barrel towhich the Treasury was entitled owing to the increase in barrelagefrom 20,000,000 to 26,000,000 standard barrels. He had found itimpracticable to conclude any arrangements on these lines. Hewas advised that the gravity of each class of beer could be raised[826]-705 C
only by a corresponding increase in the average gravity, otherwisea brewer who was now brewing at or slightly below the permittedaverage gravity would have to brew a much larger proportion of beer of a lower category than at present. There was already alarger quantity of &quot; wash&quot; than the public desired, and he there-fore recommended that the average gravity should be increased by  degrees, as set out in his Memorandum.. The President of the Board of Education said that when thequestion was previously discussed by the War Cabinet it bad beenagreed that the first step was for the Government to receive anadequate assurance that if, in order to increase the quality of the cheaper and lighter beer, they would remit the 13,000,000/. of increased taxation, the benefit of this remission would in fact gcto the consumers in the shape of better beer.Mr. Bonar Law agreed, and pointed out that, even if theCabinet agreed to raise the gravity to 1043 degrees, there was stillno assurance that the consumer would receive the benefit of the13.000,000/.The Food Controller said he was advised that it was poi ubleto obtain such a guarantee by inserting a further grade into thescale of prices, so that beer under 1020 degrees should not be soldat more than 2d. At present, retailers could demand 3d. for anyquality of beer between 1010 degrees and 1023 degrees. His pro-posal would tend to rule out the very low7 grade beer. He had drawn up a revised scale of prices, increasing the gravity by  degrees in each grade, and introducing this new grade of beersbelow 1020 degrees.The President of the Board of Education expressed hisstrong opposition to the proposed increase in average gravity. he did not appreciate the brewers&apos; argument that, in order to raisethe gravity in each scale while keeping the average gravity fixed,they would have to increase the amount of &quot;wash&quot; brewed. TheChancellor of the Exchequer was aware that the average gravity of 1040 degrees did not ensure that the lower price beers werepalatable, and he proposed, therefore, to put some constraint onbrewers to provide better beer at the lower prices. If that&apos; were done it would mean that the brewers would brew less of the heavygravity beers and more of the.middle gravity beers. The brewers,however, wanted it both ways. They desired a remission of theincreased taxation and at the same time an increase in the averagegravity. He felt quite certain that with an average gravity of1040 degrees (and this had only quite recently been raised from1032 degrees) the brewers should be able to put a good light beeron the market. Mr. Fisher went on to say that he doubted whetherthe advantage to the consumer would justify our sacrificing sucha large amount of revenue. He was not looking at it from a tem-perance point of view, but from the point of view of revenue. Hewould only be satisfied that the gravity of the lower class 1 oerswas increased if it were shown by actual analysis that the bre- fevswho had been brewing near the lower limit of the range perm- ttedfor a certain price, had increased the gravity by 3 degrees tow irdsthe upper limit. In that case, of course, it would be obviou^ thatcertain brewers, for the sake of profits, had been putting on themarket low gravity beers. The other brewers who had been brewingtowards the upper limit and putting a much better beer on themarket would not need to increase their gravity, since the rangefor any price was as wide as 6 degrees. One thing was certain ifthe Government were going to spend 13,000,000/. on this project,they ought to have a definite assurance that the consumer would obtain substantial advantages. He thought these advantageswould be small, and he doubted whether the scheme - as worthwhile.Mr. Bonar Law said that the War Cabinet would not agreeto remitting this taxation unless they had proof which would con-
7WC 577     $ 0vince the House of Commons that the consumer was actuallyobtaining the benefit of it.The President of the Local Government Board pointed outthat the gravity had only recently been substantially increased,with the intention of improving the quality. It appeared to himvery difficult to devise a scheme in which, by an arbitrary revisionof the scales, the satisfaction of the consumer of lighter beers wouldbe increased proportionately to the amount of revenue it was pro-posed to remit; and unless the consumer was really satisfied itwas not justified.The Food Controller recognised that 13,000,00OZ. was a con-siclerable sum of money, but it was worth while sacrificing it if, by so doing, the Government could allay the irritation aroused by thelow gravity beers&apos; and the restraints now imposed on drinking.Mr. Bonar Law said that it had been pointed out previouslythat an increase in average gravity would tend to increase the gravity of heavy beers. The War Cabinet had been prepared to. give up 13 000,000Z. to the brewers if they guaranteed a betterquality in the lower gravity beers, but they could not remit this amount of money in order to allow the brewers to sell more of theheavy gravity beers.. The brewers said that they could not acceptthe Cabinet proposition. He was inclined to think, however that,if the brewers were faced by the Governments refusal to raise theaverage gravity and their determination to impose a further taxunless more of the lower gravity beers were brewed, they wouldprobably find some plan for carrying out the Government scheme.Mr. Bonar Law enquired why the gravity of each scale should notbe raised 3 degrees and the price of that below 1020 degreesdecreased to 2d. without raising the average gravity?Mr. Wight-man said that the brewers of the heavy beers couldnot do it. Guinness, for example, were now brewing only two-tenths below the highest gravity allowed. If they had to increaseeach scale by 3 degrees and at the same time keep the averagegravity at 1040 degrees they would have to brew an enormousamount of &quot; wash&quot; which they were unable to sell.Lord D&apos;Abernon pointed out that the increase in the gravityto 1040 degrees had allowed the brewers of heavy beers to. increase their output of the higher gravities. It was not good policy toallow the brewers of these proprietary beers further to increase their gravity.The President of the Local Government Board said that thepurpose of the proposed sacrifice of  13,000,000 of revenue was toimprove the quality of the lighter beers. It was not part of the&quot;Governments aim to increase- the amount of higher gravity beerswhich Bass or Guinness might wish to brew. These were twoentirely different propositions, and whereas the former might be worth while, from the point of view of allaying public irritation,there was no justification whatever for the latter.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that; the brewershaving rejected the first proposition of the Government, we should negotiate on another basis, and suggested as a possible solutionthat there should be no increase in gravity of the higher price beers,but that the quality of the 3d. and 4-.d. beers should be improved,and the brewers should agree to place on the market a largerquantity of 5d. and 6d. beers.Mr. Wightman said it was a possible scheme, but he thought the brewers would not agree to it. The London brewers, inaddition to Bass and Guinness, were concerned mainly with thebrewing of high gravity beers, and the trade would object to their,being singled out for special treatment.The Food. Controller added that we were being forced step bystep to give up all the restrictions which had been imposed. Hadthe Government been ready with proposals of a permanent naturethe position might have been easier; but at present the view was[826]-705 D
held that the regulations which were now being retained had been&apos; imposed during the war in order to contribute towards success inthe war, and would never have been imposed in normal times. Inreply to a question by Mr. Bonar Law, Mr. Roberts said he did not mean by this that the Government were not entitled, in framingtheir peace-time legislation, to take advantage of their war-timeexperience; but he felt strong].)7 that they should announce their permanent policy as early as possible.The President of the Board of Trade said that he was infavour of imposing an upper limit above which brewers couldnot brew, if it could be done in such a w.a,y as to ensure a sufficientquantity of lighter gravity beers being brewed. He was informedthat there was a great shortage of beer of these qualities, and much consequent irritation.Mr. Bonar Law enquired whether there was any doubt thatbrewers would brew up to the maximum quantity allowed, what-ever attitude the Government adopted as regards the remission ofthe extra taxation.Mr. Wightman said that, the brewers would brew every barrelallowed, although they would be seriously handicapped by lack oftransport and would not be able to deliver the whole quantity. if conditions remain as at present, and if the output in fact isbrewed at only an average of 1036 degrees, which is probable, this gives 39f million bulk barrels, a figure above&apos;the pre-war bulk. If,on the other hand, the permitted average gravity is raised to 1043degrees, and if the output were in fact brewed at only 1039degrees, which is probable, then the bulk output would shrink by;3,000,000 barrels, Replying to Dr. Addison, Mr. Wightmansaid that the corisnrher would probably feel the effect of the increasein quantity which had recently been decided upon in about a week&apos;s time.Lord D&apos;Abernon repeated his conviction that quantity, andnot quality, constituted the real grievance to-day, and that the raising of,gravity would prejudice supply.The First Lord said that there were also grave complaints ofthe quality.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, as long as theaverage gravity was maintained at 1040 degrees, the proprietors ofBass and Guinness and the London brewers would brew a greatdeal of wash. All the evidence he had went to show that this wascausing considerable unrest:Mr. Bonar Law said he was informed that, in order to brewany standard high-price beer, it was necessary, with the presentaverage gravity, to brew a large quantity of wash. If the Govern-nient proposition had been accepted and the extra tax remitted, he felt quite certain that in the case of proprietary beers the highergravity beers only would have increased, and the only people to benefit would be that part of the public who consumed these brews.Lord D&apos;Abernon pointed out that the result of increasing theaverage gravity from 1032 degrees to 1040 degrees had. been toincrease the quantity of higher gravity beers instead of improving the lower gravity beers. Lord D&apos;Abernon added that. he recognised the great difficulties of the Government and the big sense of grievance which existed. His solution was to leavethe question of gravity and proceed in another way. His first step would be to place the Central Control Board under a Minister,Avho would be responsible to Parliament, and he urgedthat this should be done as soon as possible. In the second place,he was still convinced that the real grievance of the public wasquantity, and he would see that the brewers were brewing to thelimits permitted. If that were not sufficient, he would remove all restrictions as to quantity. He thought the Government should then negotiate with the trade on the whole question, and see whatagreement could be arrived at, on the lines of the Report of Mr.
Fisher&apos;s Committee. He thought the scheme of spending 13,000,000 in order to raise the gravity 3 degrees all round wasunwise and unworkable, and in any case would accomplish little.The money would be much better spent by using it to abolish licenceduties and to establish a fund for getting rid more rapidly ofredundant houses. Once these grave abuses were got rid of, thetrade would be more efficiently carried on, a great deal of thepresent discontent would evaporate, and it should not take long tocome to a satisfactory arrangement on the whole question of liquor control.Mr. Bonar Law pointed out that there was very little timein which to negotiate before the House met again,-and the Chan-cellor had to be ready with his proposals. He suggested that the extra tax might be imposed, and that the  13,000,000 should be earmarked for some such purpose as Lord D&apos;Abernon had suggested.The Chancellor of the Exchequer expressed the opinion thatif the Government insisted on the additional tax it would, in viewof the present dissatisfaction, jeopardise not only the remainingrestrictions, but even the large revenue which he estimated weshould obtain from his original proposals. He was quite preparedto spend the  13,000,000 if it were employed in providingbetter qualitjr beer. The brewers had said that they could not raisethe gravity in each scale without an increase in the average gravity.He suggested, therefore, that the Government, in announcing their refusal to agree to an increase in the average gravity, should present them with the alternatives (1) of an increased tax of 10s.per barrel, or (2) that this increase should be used in brewing thelower-priced beers at higher gravity.Mr. Bonar Law said he was still not convinced that thereshould not be a lower limit to gravity as well as an upper limit, andhe thought that the Government should announce to the brewersthat they would not remit the extra tax unless there was a definiteguarantee that the gravity of the lower-priced beers should beraised without an increase in the average gravity or in the price,and that any beer brewed under 1020 degrees should be sold for not more than 2d.The War Cabinet decided that The Food Controller and the President of the Board of Educa-tion should continue negotiations with the.brewers on thefollowing lines :  (1.) The average gravit)^ to remain at 1040 degrees.(2.) The Government would remit the extra tax of 10s.per barrel provided (a) that an increase of3 degrees in each grade in the scale were guafan-teed, except as regards the higher gravity beers(that-is, the 7d. and Sd. beers); (b) that themaximum price of beer below 1020 degreesshould be 2d.4. The War Cabinet had under consideration a&apos; Note(G.T.-7405) by the President of the Board of Trade circulating aDraft of the Coal Mines (Control) Bill, which, had been prepared with a view to carrying out the recommendations of the FirstEeport of the Sankey Commission. The Note stated that, althoughlegislation on the lilies of the Bill would certainly be required thePresident of the Board of Trade did not recommend that the Billshould be introduced into Parliament until the Second Report,dealing with the question of Nationalisation, was received fromthe Sankey Commission.   His object in circulating the Bill at thisCoal Mines(Control) Bill.(Clause 15 Provi-sions as to new capital Expendi-ture.)
stage was to show the complexity of the legislation which would benecessary to-carry out the recommendations of the First Report,and to obtain an immediate decision on one point which related to new capital expenditure (Clause 15 of the Bill). It was particu-larly urgent that approval or otherwise should be given forthwith to the provisions of the said Clause, as it was highly desirable; inorder to get developments restarted, that owners should at once beinformed that the Government undertake to include in the bill the provisions contained in Clause 15. The President of the Boardof Trade therefore asked to be authorised to furnish owners witha copy of the provisions of Clause 15, and to state that they hadthe approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government.The War Cabinet decided To authorise the President of the Board of Trade to informthe owners of the provisions of Clause 15 of the DraftBill, and to state that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentapproved their incorporation in the Bill.5. With reference to War Cabinet 557, Min. 2, the WarCabinet approved the following Terms of Reference for the SelectCommittee on Land Values Duties :&apos; &quot; To enquire into the present position of the duties imposed by Part I of the Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910; tomake recommendations in regard to their retention, altera-tion or repeal, and in regard to such legislative or administra-&apos; tive measures as may be necessary in order to give effectthereto; to enquire into the basis and present position of thevaluations of land prescribed by Part I of the Finance(1909-10) Act, 1910, and to make recommendations thereon,regard being had to the desirability of State valuations ofland being available for public purposes.&quot;Herring Fishing 6. With reference to War Cabinet 570, Min. 1, the Chan-Industry, cellor of the Exchequer said that he had to report to the WarCabinet that, at the request of the Lord Privy Seal, he had net the  Secretary for Scotland and representatives of the Board ofAgriculture on the previous day, and had reached a settlement inregard to this matter. He had agreed to a scheme by which theGovernment would be prepared to purchase at the 15th September,1919, sound pickled herrings cured during the present season, if atthat date the curers had been unable to dispose of them owing tothe continued closure of Continental markets. Scheduled prices would be fixed, and the arrangement would apply to a limitedbarrelage of 400,000 barrels. This scheme would protect the cureragainst loss, but, on the other hand, would not allow them to makeany profit through Government assistance.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.Qth June, 1919.Land ValuesDuties.o
