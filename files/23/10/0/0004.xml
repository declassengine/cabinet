2Electricity SupplyBill.The question ofGovernment Profit.Ireland.Limitation ofPrices.Prohibition of strikes withoutNotice1. With reference to War Cabinet 550, Minute 4, the Wax-Cabinet had under consideration a draft of the Electricity SupplyBill (Paper G.T.-7093).Sir Auckland Geddes said that the Bill had been consideredby a special Committee composed of the Chancellor of theExchequer, Sir Eric Geddes, and Sir Albert Stanley.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that the clauseunder which the Government was to get \ per cent, was a corn-promise to which he had agreed at Sir Eric Geddes&apos; earnestrequest. He would have preferred the Government to receive more.The present arrangement was that the stations should be run soas toi pay for all working expenses plus any additional profitwhich the Board of Trade might decide. He himself thought itwas right that the Government should get some profit out of theworking of the stations, but Sir Eric Geddes was strongly opposedto this.The Home Secretary pointed out that Clause 33 of the DraftBill provided for the Electricity Commissioners lending money onsuch terms as the Government thought fit., Sir-Auckland Geddes said that the specific points referred tothe Cabinet for decision were : Firstly, the question of the Govern-ment being reimbursed to the extent of \ per cent.; secondly, thequestion of leaving it open to the Electricity Commissioners to fix the margin by which receipts might exceed expenditure; thirdly,the question as to whether Ireland should be included in the Bill;and, fourthly, the suggested clause making strikes without noticea penal offence. The Bill was only intended to provide for the initial stages, and he presumed that later on it would not be neces-sary for the State to finance the power stations.In reply to a question, Mr. Bonar Law stated that it was understood that the powers now being taken under this bill would eventually be transferred to the Ministry of Ways and communications.The War Cabinet proceeded to consider whether the Billshould apply to Ireland. It was explained that the Chief secretary was absent in Ireland.The Home Secretary thought that if the Ministry of ways and Communications was going to administer the Bill, it should certainly include Ireland, where there could be a special board for dealing with the supply of electricity, in the same way as was proposed in the case of ways and communications. It was very desirable that the&apos;Ministry of Ways and Communications shouldant as the co-ordinating authority.Sir Auckland Geddes said that the only objection raised fromthe Irish point of view was one by the Irish Local GovernmentBoard, which raised the objection that the inclusion of Ireland was contrary to the principle generally adhered to. The case mightbe met by the appointment of a Board composed of Irishmen. he did not think, ,however, that they were fully informed in thematter.The Chancellor of the Exchequer was of opinion that it was-very desirable that the Bill should apply to Ireland. *Sir Auckland Geddes said it was proposed to leave it open tothe^ Electricity Commissioners to fix the margin by which thereceipts of the District Electricity Boards might exceed their expenditure. .The Chancellor of the Exchequer read Clause 25, paragraph^!,of the Draft Bill, and said that he would like to omit the words &quot;sofar as practicable T&apos; in the second line.Mr. Bonar Law said that the next question was whetherClause 36, which extended the Conspiracy and Protection ofProperty Act, 1875, to persons employed by a District electricity board, and made it a penal offence&apos;to strike without warning,should be inserted in the present Bill.   For his part, he thought
it was desirable that the 1875 Act should be extended; it was merely carrying out something which was already law in regardto persons employed in the supply of gas and water, and ifelectricity had been in general use when that Act was passed therewas no doubt that electricity would have been added.The President of the Local Government Board said he thought the insertion of Clause 36 would only result in annoying labour and do no good whatever. He was of opinion that the men, if they wished to do so, would strike without giving clue notice in spiteof the clause, and it would be impossible to take proceedings against, say, 50,000 men. When the Act had been extended tomeet the recently threatened electrical strike public opinion hadbeen behind the Government. It did not follow that this would always be the case.The Secretary of State for War said that there was no doubtthat, when the electricians threatened to strike a short time ago,the extension of the 1875 Act, under the powers of the Defence ofthe Realm Act, had a decisive effect, and in his opinion preventeda strike. In the next few years discrimination would have to be shown, and people taught to draw a line between strikes againstprivate employers and strikes which affected the whole community.If a stable Government was not going to fight for the upholding ofthese principles it could have no permanent foothold.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that the 1875 Actwas only extended, in the threatened electrical strike, under powerof the Defence of the Realm Act, and if Clause 36 was not inserted in the present Bill the Government would have no power to applyit when the Defence of the Realm Act ceased to be operative. Itwas no use having public opinion on the side of the Governmentunless the Government possessed the powers necessary to take effective measures.Sir Eric Geddes said that if a Bill came in, in the future, forthe nationalisation of railways on the lines of the Bill under dis-cussion, it would then be necessary to make the Conspiracy and protection of Property Act applicable to. railways, and in hisopinion the moment was extremely opportune to bring in the safe-guard in the present Bill.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that Labour was nowpressing for the nationalisation of public utility services, andLabour must be prepared to forgo something in order to obtainthis.The Minister of Labour said he was strongly in favour of theinclusion of the Clause in the Bill, and thought public opinion would support the Government in such a course.The Secretary for Scotland concurred, and said that theanalogue of gas and water was complete. The effect of the recentaction under the Defence of the Realm Act had succeeded in glasgow as it had in London -The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Bill should provide for the Treasury making a smallcharge in respect of their guarantee;(&amp;.) Ireland should be included in the Bill, and that the chief secretary should be so informed;(c.) Paragraph 1 of Clause 25 should be amended to read asfollows : &apos;&apos; A District Electricity Board shall fix their charges for electricity so that their receipts may besufficient to cover their expenditure, with such marginas the Electricity Commissioners may allow &quot;;&apos;(d.) Clause 36, extending the Conspiracy and Protection ofProperty Act, .1875, to persons employed by a DistrictElectricity Board, should be retained in the Bill;[826]-521B 2
(e.) The following Committee should be appointed to examinethe drafting of the Bill before it is presented toParliament: Sir A. C. Geddes (Chairman),Sir E. Geddes,The Secretary for Scotland,The Attorney-General or Solicitor-General,The. Home Secretary,Colonel Storr (Secretary).Permanent 2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the commissions in the   Secretary of State for War (Paper G.T.-7072), in which he askedBoyal Air Force.      th.&amp;t authority might be given for 1,500 permanent commissions tobe granted to Air Force officers.General Seely stated that difficulty had been found ininducing officers to sign on for a further period of service unless apermanent commission in the Air Force was granted to them.The 1,500 commissions asked for was a very modest figure,especially in view of the urgent requests which were now beingmade to the Air Ministry, from the East and elsewhere, foraeroplane squadrons. He also asked, in addition to the 1,500permanent commissions, for authority to recruit, on present ratesof pay, up to 30,000 other ranks. It was most essential that theAir Force should keep some of the men whom they had taken agood deal of trouble to train, and although in all probability theywould not recruit up to 30,000, he suggested this as a maximumfigure.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he was afraid, if pex-mission to do this was granted, it might prejudice the future ratesof pay in the Royal Air Force. Trouble had already arisen inendeavouring to distinguish between the pay of the Army ofOccupation and those ranks which were not in the Army ofOccupation, and this had resulted in having to place those in thelatter on the higher scale. He wanted to avoid Air Force recruits,who might at a later date be enlisted on a lower scale, demandingto be put on the same basis as those recruited at the present time.&apos; General Seely pointed out that it was provided, in the termsof contract of the men now being recruited, that they would revert to a lower scale of pay should it come into force, and he thought there would be no trouble in this direction.The War Cabinet decided that Authority should be given to recruit the Royal Air Force at existing rates of pay up to 10,000 non-commissioned officers and men, and 1,500 permanent officers, subjectto the understanding with the Treasury that the ratesof pay should be increased or decreased according to future rates of pay when those rates are finally settled,and that this reservation should be stated in the recruiting appeal.3. With reference to War Cabinet 542, Minute 5, and paper g.T.-7107, Lord Robert Cecil asked that the War Cabinet wouldgive authority to members of the Supreme Economic Council whorepresented heads of Departments to come to decisions on behalfof, and without constant reference to, the Departments concerned.He said that the work of the Council had been greatly hampered by the fact that nothing could be decided by its members without reference to this country. The Treasury and the Board of trade had already given the necessary authority to their delegates, andhe wished to have the directions of the War Cabinet that otherDepartments should do the like.Supreme economic council.
Unrest in India.Secret Service&apos;Committee.Conciliation and arbitration board for government employees.Lord Curzon said he would like to consult Mr. Harmsworthon this matter before expressing an opinion.     ;Mr. Churchill said that, in the view of the military authorities,the Blockade should be discontinued immediately.The War Cabinet decided To approve the recommendations submitted by Lord robert cecil, subject to no objection being offered by the ActingSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, after consultationwith the Blockade Department.4. The Secretary of State for India stated that be had receivedthree telegrams reporting further rioting in India, of which hethought the War Cabinet should be informed. Though thesituation gave cause for anxiety, he did not consider it seriousA telegram dated the 11th April stated that a slight disturbanceoccurred at Lahore on the previous day in connection with passive resistance. A few shots were fired by the police on the mob whichattempted to reach the civil station. One person was killed and four wounded. Order was quickly restored. A further telegram,dated the 11th April, reported that the city telegraph office atAhmedabad had been attacked, and at the time of the despatchof the message was being burned by the mob. A telegram had also been received from the Punjab, dated the 11th April, statingthat serious rioting had occurred that day at Amritsar. the telegraph office was wrecked, the goods shed destroyed, and theNational Chartered Bank and Town Hall had been burnt. ThreeEuropeans were killed. Three hundred troops were being sent toAmritsar from Lahore as soon as possible, including 100 British.Mr. Montagu then read a telegram which he had received from theVicero)^, dated the 14th April. The Viceroy said it was difficultto attribute the present outbreak to any particular cause. Racialfeeling, Mohammedan soreness, Rowlatt Bills, high food prices no doubt all contributed. It was noteworthy that outbreaks had occurred at places where our policy had been repressive (Punjab),Laissez-faire (Bombay), and also from mere accidental collision(Delhi). The Viceroy stated that, so far, there were no indica-tions of active disturbance outside the Punjab and Bombay areas,but as the passive resistance movement ha,d spread its net verywidely the trouble might easily occur anywhere. Also that, sofar, the town rabble had been the actively hostile element, not thecountry folk. Military measures, he added, had been taken, asfar as it was possible, at dangerous points of movement over thecountry. So far he had acted with great restraint, but if therewas any further collision in any of the main centres of the dis-tufbance he would, he thought, be in a position to deal effectivelvwith it. No unrest among the police had been reported.Mr. Montagu said that, in reply to a private question in theHouse, he proposed to read the three telegrams, one of which hadalready been published.5. The War Cabinet had under consideration the Minutes ofthe Third Meeting of the Secret Service Committee (paper g.T.-7085).The War Cabinet decided To approve the proposals of the Committee, subject to- theconcurrence of the Minister of Labour.6. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Paper G.T.-7096) on. thequestion of the representation of civil servants before the Con-ciliation and Arbitration Board by outside Trade Unions, together
- .      .:.-        t......*.....2  Whitehall Gardens, S. W.,April 14, 1919.with a letter from the Secretary of the Conciliation and arbitration board (Paper G.T.-6928), and a Memorandum from the Con-ciliation and Arbitration Board (Paper G.T.-7102).The Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer statedthat the Terms of Reference of the Conciliation and arbitration board for Government employees, as settled by War Cabinet 252,Minute 6, prescribed that &quot;Any claim which may fall within the Terms of Referenceshall be heard before the Board acting as a triplicate Chair-man, together with not more than throe official representa-tives, and not more than three representatives of the class; of employees concerned or their Associations, where suchAssociation exists. Provided that in all cases the employees concerned shall be at liberty to nominate as one of theirrepresentatives a person who is not a member of the class inquestion. Such a person shall not, however, be a signatory to-any agreement arrived at by conciliation.&quot;In his Memorandum the Chancellor of the Exchequer sug-gested that the words &apos;&apos; Such a person shall not, however, be asignatory to. any agreement arrived at by conciliation &apos;&apos; should be deleted.In their Memorandum the Conciliation and arbitration board concurred, but suggested that the objections to these wordspointed out by the Chancellor of the Exchequer applied also tothe preceding sentence, which while apparently enabling was really restrictive, and asked that the vdiole of the passage shouldbe omitted from &quot; all their Associations &apos;&apos; to the end, in orderthat the Board might be free to regulate their procedure in eachcase according to the practice adopted by the Department orDepartments concerned in that case.The War Cabinet decided: (1.) To substitute the title &quot;Civil Service arbitration board &quot; for the existing title &quot; Conciliation and arbitration Board for Government Employees&quot;(2.) That the Terms of Reference of the Board, as settled by War Cabinet 252, Minute 6, should be amended (a.) by the omission of the following words &quot;or their Associations, where such Associationexists. Provided that in all cases the employees concerned shall be at liberty to nominate as one of their representatives aperson who is not a member of the class inquestion. Such a person shall not, however, bea signatory to any agreement arrived at byconciliation.&apos;&apos;(&amp;.) that the following words should be insertedinstead of the words omitted &quot; provided thatit shall be open to the Board at their discre-tion to permit the number of representatives on either side to be increased.&quot;
