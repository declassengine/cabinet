21. The Chancellor of the Exchequer called attention to a bill which Mr. Bottomley proposed to introduce in the House ofCommons dealing with dormant bank balances. Mr. Bottomleyhad put the value of these unclaimed balances at 100,0O0,000Z.,and his proposal was that they should be handed over to thePublic Trustee, presumably with a view to their ultimately becomingthe property of the Government. From the enquiries which he(the Chancellor of the Exchequer) had made, he found that the banks put the figure at about 500,OOOZ., and they were strongly opposed to any legislative interference. He did not think theGovernment could oppose the Bill, but he would welcome the viewsof the War Cabinet as to the attitude to be taken to the Bill.*The War Cabinet expressed the view that, while the small amount involved would not justify the Governmentintroducing a Bill, the Government should not resist aBill if introduced by a private member.Pay of the Eoyal 2. With reference to War Cabinet 564, Minute 6, the Warnavy. Cabinet further considered the Admiralty proposals for the pay ofthe Royal Navy and Royal Marines (men) (Paper G.T.-7144), andalso had under consideration a Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for War (Paper G.T.-7190), showing the effect whichCommittees of the War Office and the Air Ministry consideredacceptance of the Admiralty proposals would entail upon the ratesof pay in the Army and Air Force respectively ; and a memorandumby the First Lord of the Admiralty (Paper G.T.-7223).The First Lord said that there was little to add to the state-ments he had made at the previous discussions of the War Cabineton this matter- He had circulated on the previous day a shortMemorandum (Paper G.T.-7223) clearing up a small point of detail.The Secretary of State for War had been under the impression that the suggested rate of pay of 4.s\ a-day was to be given to all ableseamen; in fact, however, this was only granted to long-termsailors, the rate for short-service men being 6d. a-day less thancorresponding ratings who enlisted for the longer period. 1 Thesituation in the Navy remained as grave as it well could be. Themen believed, and with justification, he thought, that their case hadbeen over long delayed. They understood that, the Jerram Com-mittee having been set up, the Government would at once considerthe.men&apos;s claims and the recommendations made by the Committee,apart from the bearing those claims might have on the other services.Mr. Bonar Law said that he had endeavoured when in Paristo secure an opportunity of discussing the question with the PrimeMinister, but owing to the great pressure on the Prime Minister inconnection with the Terms of Peace the Prime Minister had asked him to return to London, and had given him full power to act onhis behalf in the matter. He (Mr. Bonar Law) was of the opinionthat in substance they would have to accept the Report as it stood. At the same time,1 if the recommendations of the ReportSeparation as  regards separation allowances and   children&apos;s  allowances wereallowances. accepted, namely, that they should be left for final settlement untilthe end of the year, he felt that the Government would be committed to granting something unless an announcement,wasmade that the continuance or otherwise of these allowances must depend definitely on variations in the cost of living.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, as he understood,the Navy had never given separation allowances at all until the&apos; 1st October, 1914, although there were no regulations to preventmarriage.   During the war they had had to give separation allow-; ances both for the wife and children.   The Jerram Report proposed* the chancellor of the exchequer has since learned that the banks nowestimate the amount at about 1,000,ooox, and that they have no strong; objection tothe bill.Unclaimed BankBalances.
that the allowances for children should he permanent, but the con-tinuance of the wife&apos;s separation allowance after the 1st January,1920, should depend on the cost of living. Meanwhile, the presentseparation allowances should continue in force until the end of 1919.If by that date the cost of living decreased by 25 per cent., theal owances, other than those for children, should be withdrawn or if the decrease were less than 25 per cent. should be propor-tionately reduced by the amount of the decrease in the cost ofliving If the War Cabinet decided to accept the Jerram proposals on this point, he was prepared to fall in with them, subject to oneproviso. Since the Government were now, for the first time in theNavy, going to recognise marriage officially, he would suggest thata man should serve for a certain fixed period, say three years&apos; fullman&apos;s service, before he was allowed to benefit from the allowancewhich his marriage occasioned.Mr. Bonar Law said that he thought he could agree generally with the proposals regarding the wife&apos;s separation allowance, but hedisliked strongly the idea of committing the Government to a new system of separation allowances for children. If the payment was sufficient there was no need to make any provision for children atall. He had consulted Mr. Barnes on this point in Paris, and thelatter had been in agreement with him that the pay of men in theNavy should be such as to warrant no claims for children&apos;s or other allowances. Unless it was made clear immediately that the; con-tinuance of allowances &quot;would depend upon the cost of living, and unless the Government could guard themselves in some such manner as this, they would find themselves committed to giving some allowance in addition to pay.&apos; The First Lord suggested that Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s point would bemet if it were announced that the question of allowances, set out inPart III of the Admiralty Report, were reserved for full consideration at some future date.Mr. Bonar Law repeated that the question of grantingallowances in future must be associated somehow or other with thecost of living.Dr. Macnamara said that he thought the proposition was quite a. fair one. He felt, however, that he must warn the War Cabinetthat soldiers would certainly expect a continuance of their separation allowances.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the case of theArmy was different, in that the rates of pay were not yet fixed,and depended to a large extent on the other conditions of service which also had not been decided upon up to the present. If theWar Office decided to grant separation allowances to soldiers he presumed that they would make a corresponding reduction in their proposed rates of pay. The important point as regards the army was that the War Office had to depend for the fulfilment of its obligations at home upon short-service men, and it was not desirablethat these should be encouraged to marry.The First Lord said that, as he understood the position, theCabinet wanted the Admiralty to adopt a modified form of thesystem of &quot;marriage on the strength,&quot; which had been in vogue inthe Army. His opinion was that this system was absolutelyindefensible from every point of view. The trouble the Governmenthad had with the &quot; unmarried wife &quot; on the outbreak of war was due in large measure to the restrictions placed on marriage in the ranks. He realised very fully the difficulties of the Leader of theHouse and of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but he felt bound topoint out that, in placing restrictions on the marriage of men in theServices, merely from the point of view of financial economy, theWar Cabinet were trenching on very dangerous ground. Withthese observations he was prepared to accept the proposal ofMr. Bonar Law.Mr. Bonar Law said that he felt things had gone too far in the
Navy for them to delay any longer before taking a decision.   Theymust leave the Army as free as possible, and the Secretary of State,in considering the rates of pay that he would offer for the post-warArmy, should look at the matter mainly from the point of view of attracting sufficient men to fulfil our obligations.The Secretary of State for War said that he did not oppose the proposals put forward by the Admiralty, but he felt bound again to point out the consequential effect they would have on the rates of pay in the Army. At the- moment he had no idea what our commit-ments were likely to be in the East or in Europe, and so he couldform no opinion as to the future requirements of the Army. Itwas therefore too early to make any attempt to say what effect theproposals were likely to produce on the pay of the Army, but therewas no doubt that, when the. rates of pay for the post-war Armycame to be considered, they would be greatly affected by the presentdecision.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) With regard to separation allowances, the existing&apos;allowances should continue until the 31st December,1919.(b.) Thn future of separation allowances from that date shouldbe the subject of further consideration, regard being, had to the cost of living in determining the question.Pensions. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he could not agreeto the recommendation that the new scales of pensions should beapplied to all pensioners already on the rolls. In the case of theCivil Service it had been arranged that all pensioners, during theper;od in which the war bonus had effect, should have the benefitof their pension plus the war bonus, but this concession had notbeen granted to pensioners who had retired before this decision.Dr Macnamara quoted as follows from the Admiraltyproposals : &quot; That the Admiralty recommend that the case of thesemen, in view of their past services, should receive the most favourable attention of which the circumstances admit, butrecognising that the question is one effecting all Governmentpensioners, they do not feel able to urge it as a claim on behalfof the Navy alone.&quot;Mr. Bonar Law said he felt that the War Cabinet must rejectthis proposal, in view of its possible widespread extension.The First Lord suggested that it should be announced that consideration of this proposal had been reserved for the time being,and would be announced later.Mr. Bonar Law said that he felt there was a great objection in not having the whole question settled. To say that this matter was still under consideration might give rise to hopes that the cabinet would be prepared to make some concessions.The War Cabinet decided that-  .The revised scales for pensions proposed by the Admiralty should apply as from the 1st April, 1919, to all future pensioners,all pensioners now serving, and all who have served duringthe war, including those serving in a civil capacity. - the revised scales should not apply to any other pensioners.Widows&apos; Pensions. Dr. Macnamara stated that the men had strongly urged, and theAdmiralty Committee recommended, that when a man died hiswidow should have two-thirds of his pension under usual conditions,.    : and that corresponding compassionate. grants should be made to hischildren. The claim was based on the fact that these grants were givento officers&apos; widows it&apos; they could show that they were in necessitous.
circumstances. The men argued that the widows of all lower ratingswould be in poor circumstmces, and it was felt that they should begranted some allowance as a matter of course.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this concession could not be given to the Navy without granting it also to theArmy and the Civil Service. While the cost for the Navy was notexcessive, the cumulative cost would be prodigious.The War Cabinet decided Not to approve of the recommendations regarding widows&apos;pensions and childretfs compassionate allowances.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, when the matter had been discussed before, the feeling of the War Cabinet was thatthe increases should date from the day on which they were announced. The Jerram Committee had recommended ante-datingthem to the. 1st October, 1918. The Admiralty recommended thatthe increases should be ante-dated to the 1st February, 1919, thedate of the last interim increase given to the Navy. But there wasno reason for connecting these increases with the bonus sdven on thatdate, since it had been given to the Navy merely because some allowance had to be given to men who were retained in the armies of Occupation.Dr. iVlacnamara pointed out that it was only to meet the wishes of the War Office that they had agreed to date that interim increase from the 1st February rather than the 1st October. Evenif the present increases were&apos;ante-dated to the 1st February he feltthere would be a certain amount of dissatisfaction that they werenot being carried back to the 1st October. In reply to a question byMr. Bonar Law, Dr. Macnamara said that the cost of ante-dating the increases to the 1st February would be about 840,OOOLMr. Forster said that a decision to ante-date the increases to the1st February would be a strong claim for a long ante-date when therates of pay of the post-war Army were established.Mr. Bonar Law said that he felt the Cabinet were granting verygreat concessions, and he was afraid that unless the increases wereante-dated as suggested by the Admiralty they would be robbed ofa great deal of their value in the eyes of the Navy, who would regard these concessions as grudgingly and unwillingly given.The War Cabinet decided that The increases should take effect from the 1st February, 1919.Subject to the decisions arrived at, above, the War cabinet decided To approve the recommendations of the Admiralty as set forth in Paper G.T.-7144.Naval Officers&apos;Pay. 3- The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he wished tcmake an appeal for the future. Now that the rates of pay for menin the Navy had been settled, he presumed that recommendations would soon be put forward for pay for the naval officer, and hewould like the Adi &quot;rait&quot; not to come to any settlement or formulate&apos; any final decision? on tnis matter without the fullest consultationwith the other Dt,^ ....nents concerned. He felt that there shouldbe a full &quot;War Cabinet discussion first of all as to the lines on whichthe Admiralty shouh1 -^oceed when putting forward any proposals.The Soldiers&apos; and rs&apos; Pay Committee bad twice drawn his attention to the necessity for correlating the system of pay and allowances in the three Services, and he had circulated a memo-randum to the War Cabinet suggesting that a Committee be set upfor this purpose.[826J-621 0Date of Increase.
The First Lord said that he himself had resisted pressure, bothpublicly and in the press, iii order that the War Cabinet shouldhave as much time as possible to consider the Admiralty proposalscarefully. The Government, however, had recognised as long ago as last December that there was a long outstanding debt to be paid inthe case of the Navy.Dr. Macnamara said that the report of the Jerram committee regarding the pay of officers was expected on the following day.Mr. Bonar Law suggested that, before the Board of Admiraltycame with final recommendations to the War Cabinet, the report should be referred to the ?soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee.The First Lord said that he was quite prepared to discuss thematter with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary ofState for War.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that what he objected toin these matters was the form of procedure. The Committee whichhad been looking into the question of naval pay was composedentirely of naval office is, who had no idea of the conditionsobtaining in the other Services. If they had been fully aware ofthese conditions they might have made proposals different fromthose which had been put forward. They had conducted an enquiry,and the method in which this had been done had made it quite certain that their views would become known to the Fleet at large,so that when the Admiralty came with their recommendations tothe War Cabinet the latter had no option but to accept them.Lord Curzon said that the Beport of the Jerram Committee asregards men had become public property. It should, however, bepossible to avoid this in the case of their report on the pay of theofficers.The First Lord said that he though it would be impossible,owing to the nature of the enquiry which had been carried out, toprevent the recommendations from being known to the Fleet. the sense of grievance was as bitter amongst the officers as amongstthe men, and, in view of the conditions obtaining in the Service, he himself did not wonder at it. It was true that the JerramCommittee comprised only naval officers. The suggestion had beenmade that other people should be included on it, but it hadoccasioned a great outburst of feeling in the Navy, where the opinion was held that this matter concerned the Navy alone.The Secretary of State for War said that, as regards the Army,the most far-reaching changes had taken place owing to the increasein the cost of living. The Army, before the War, had been run onthe basis that a subaltern had a private income. Expenses had soincreased that in some cavalry regiments difficulty was found in providing for the upkeep of uniform and in making provision forhorses. In addition, there were numbers of officers who had wontheir commissions on the field by acts of,saperb and unexampledbravery, and who had nothing apart from their pay. . Great changesv,ould have to be introduced, and some kind of social lite inventedthat would enable these men to maintain the status of a commissionedofficer.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he must have a meeting with the First Lord and the Secretary of State for War on. the .Admiralty proposals for officers&apos; pay.   He would be glad, however,if a preliminary meeting could be held between the representativesof the three Departments to discuss the matter.The Secretary of State for India suggested that, since  any&apos;proposals affecting the British Army would react on &quot;the Army inIndia, the India Office should be kept in touch with the proposalsof the other Departments.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of Statefor War, and the First Lord of the Admiralty should
confer together on the proposal for naval officers&apos; pay tobe put forward by the Jerram Committee before theBoard of Admiralty formulated definite proposals on thissubject for submission to the War Cabinet.(b.) Prior to the meeting of the three&apos; Ministers, the Jerramproposals should be examined by a conference of expertsrepresenting the Treasury, the War Office, theAdmiralty, the Air Ministry, and the India Office.4. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandum from the Ministry of Shipping, on the suggested sale of nationalshipyards to the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades(Paper G.T.-7225).The Shipping Controller said that the War Cabinet on the8th January last (War Cabinet 514, Minute 7) had approved of his proposal to dispose of the national shipyards, and in the course ofthe discussion the Prime Minister had said that it would be useful ifhe could ascertain if the yards could not be taken over under someco-operative arrangement. Sir Joseph Maclay said that he had accordingly interviewed representatives of the Co-operative Union,,the Co-operative Wholesale Society, and various trades unions, theTrades Union Parliamentary Congress Committee, and other repre-sentatives in the labour movement. After prolonged discussion theexecutive of the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades had now decided to submit to its members a draft Memorandum of theterms on which he thought it possible that the Government mightoffer the yards to the Federation. The executive1 of the Federa-tion had welcomed the proposal, and were prepared, if the WarCabinet endorsed it, to submit it to a conference of the shipbuilding and Engineering Trades to be held at Cardiff in thecourse of the next few days. The draft proposals, whichwere now submitted for the approval of the Cabinet, were asfollows : (1.) That the national shipyards at Chepstow and Beachley be sold to the trades unions of the shipbuilding and; 1 engineering industries at a price to be agreed upon.(2.) That the whole amount of the purchase-price be paid inthe manner following, and untd paid off be.secured by asecond mortgage debenture at a rate of interest to beagreed; that the purchase-price be paid in such amountsand at such intervals as the \inions may elect, provided always that the unions shall pay an annual instalment ofnot less than  ......... (amount to be agreed).(3.) That the unions may borrow from outside sources suchsum or sums of money as shall be deemed requisite forthe working and development of the yards, such sum orsums to be secured by first mortgage debentures.(4.) That the Government undertake to hand over the yards insuch condition as shall render the yards fit to be workedupon a commercial basis.(5.) That the management of the yards be entrusted for thefirst three years jointly to the unions and to persons of experience in shipyard management, to be selected withthe approval of the Government.Sir Joseph Maclay said that he felt bound to point out that alarge sum of money was involved, and that his proposal entailed theGovernment bearing the financial risk of the failure of the under-taking. He hoped, however, in view: i of the present industrial situation and of the valuable lessons to be learned from an experi-ment of this kind, that the War Cabinet would waive the financial considerations. The price that would probably be realised by the[a26]-621 DSuggested Sale ofNationalShipyards to theFederation of engineering andShipbuildingTrades.
sale of the two Chepstow yards, the cost of which had been4,000,000?., might range between 500.000Z. and 1,000,0001.The Minister of Labour said that he was fully in accord withthe proposals of the Shipping Controller. He thought their effect upon labour would be excellent; they would show that the Govern-ment had no prejudice against their undertaking a co-operativeenterprise of this character.Mr. Bonar Law said that be had been informed by the ShippingController that he was not afraid of opposition from the ship-builders.The Chancellor of the Exchequer inquired what sum the yardswould probably fetch by sale in the open market in the event of theproposed negotiations breaking down.The Shipping Controller replied that it was difficult to say, buthe thought that the sum would range between 500,000Z. and1,000,OOOZ.The War Cabinet decided To approve the proposals of the Shipping Controller.5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by sir arthur Steel-Maitland relating to Belgium and Imperial Preference(Paper G.T.-7206).Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland stated that the Belgian Governmenthad put forward a request that they should be accorded the benefitof any tariff preference given to this country by the Dominions, or tothe Dominions by this country. The Belgian Government hadneither suggested nor excluded a reciprocal grant of preference byBelgium to British products. In conversation, however, Belgianrepresentatives had expressed the view that Belgium would be readyto give such a preference. The competition of Belgium with theUnited Kingdom, once her factories had been fully rehabilitated,would be somewhat felt in certain trades, e.g., iron, steel, and glass;an examination, however, of the trades affected indicated that evenin normal times the amount of competition would be comparatively small. As regards the Dominions, industries in Canada might be slightly affected, otherwise raw materials alone were concerned, andof these sugar was the only one likely to be of importance.. TheBelgian Government had pressed for an early reply on this question,as the French had already approached them with a view to concludingclose working arrangements in most branches of economic life. Sincewriting the memorandum under discussion he had heard the natureof these proposals, which contained- inter alia a Customs union which would include, on the French side, the whole of the devastatedarea, and, on the Belgian side, two-thirds of the country. Part ofthe Port of. Antwerp was also to be reserved exclusively for Frenchpurposes, The feeling in Belgium was against the acceptance of theFrench proposals. Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland added that, as regardsthe legal aspect of the question, exceptional treatment of the naturedesired by Belgium was inconsistent with the British (but not withthe American) interpretation of the most-favoured-nation clause in commercial treaties. It might, however, be held that the exceptionalcondition of Belgium warranted exceptional temporary treatment.The Belgian representatives had stated that it was felt that Belgiummust lean on some great Power; they did not want that Power tobe France, and they preferred the United Kingdom to the UnitedStates..  . , -, ;      ... -   .. Mr. Bonar Law said that preferential treatment pure and simpleto Belgium was impossible. It was possible that the Belgians mightbe treated in the British Empire in the same way as they treated us.He did not think, however, it would be of much use making anyproposal to the Belgians until we knew what.our own fiscal policy was going to be...
2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,May 9, 1919/Lord Curzon said that the problem bristled with difficulties, butwe had to contemplate the fact that Belgium might be bound fiscallyto France. His suggestion was that Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland, theBoard of Trade, and the Foreign ()office might consult together witha view to putting to the Belgians some counter-proposition in theform of a Customs Union or special concessions. We did not wantBelgium to drift into the arms of France, and in his opinion it was worth while exploring the possibility of presenting to the Belgiansan alternative proposal.Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland thought that Belgium was mainly concerned with preference given by the Dominions ; preference withthis country mattered little to her. His own feeling was that, as amatter of principle, he did not want our Imperial preference tamperedwith by any outsider. The Belgians, however, as he had stated, feltthat they must lean on some great Power, and they wanted that power to be the United Kingdom.Colonel Amery said that the Secretary of State for the Coloniesfelt that the whole structure of our relations with the Dominionswith regard to preference would be endangered if we admitted aforeign Power on the same terms as the colonies. Hard cases madebad law, and once we allowed a foreign Power Imperial preferenceterms, it would be impossible to say that our preferential relationsdid not extend beyond the Dominions. Canada&apos;s relation to Englandwould then be on the same basis as Belgium&apos;s relation to England.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had been informed in the House of Commons that Imperial preference was infringingthe most-favoured-nation clause. This was nonsense as applied to a unit like the British Empire, but once a country like Belgium was included, people would be entitled to say that the niost-favoured-nation clause had broken down.Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland said that, as regards a breach of themost-favoured-nation clause, a circular had been sent out last yearto the effect that we would give special treatment to our Allies afterthe war.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this special treat-ment was only as regards supplies, and arose out of war conditions.The proposition under discussion was not preference at all, andshould be kept apart. It might be desirable to offer the Belgians a customs Union, such as had been suggested by Lord Curzon, but itshould not be linked up with preference.The Acting President of the Board of Trade said that, withregard to the suggestion that the Board of Trade - should consult with Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland with a view to putting a counter-proposition to the Belgians, he was perfectly willing to do this, buthe feared that the result would not be very satisfactory, inasmuch as the Board of Trade was far from clear as to the future trade relations of this country, and had, so far, been unable to form anysound line of policy.It was pointed out that a matter of this kind was of vitalconcern to the Dominions, and that it was for them to say yes or no,and Mr. Bonar Law suggested that the Secretary of State for theColonies might discuss the subject with the Dominion Premiers.The War Cabinet decided (a.) Not to approve the granting of preferential treatment to belgium.(b.) That the Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs andSir Arthur Steel-Maitland should consult together witha view to framing a possible counter-proposal to the belgians for submission to the War Cabinet.
