1. With reference to War Cabinet 566, Minute 3, the WarCabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Air relating to the pay, &amp;c, of the Royal Air Force(Paper G.T.-7479).The Secretary of State for Air read to the War Cabinet a letterhe had sent to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the previous evening with regard to this matter (Appendix), and he now askedwhether the method suggested in his letter for dealing with the pay of the Royal Air Force would be adopted.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that, in his letter,the Secretary of State for Air referred to the Jerram Report as if that report had made recommendations regarding the pay of officers.This was a misapprehension, as the Jerram Report only dealt withthe pay of men, and it was the Halsey Report which dealt with the pay of officers.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he would deal first with the very helpful proposals made in the letter he hadreceived that morning from the Secretary of State for Air.With regard to proposal (1), he was in substantial accord withthe method of treatment suggested by Mr. Churchill, and welcomed the proposal that an Inter-Departmental Committee should beappointed to co-ordinate the proposals of the Admiralty, the WarOffice, and the Air Force as regards pay. He must, however,deprecate the suggestion that the Committee should report within aweek or ten days. He did not think the amount of work theCommittee would have to do was realised, and he therefore proposedthat instructions should be given to the Chairman of the Committeeto report as rapidly as possible. He agreed to the composition ofthe Committee as suggested by Mr. Churchill, and welcomed thesuggestion that Mr. Fisher should take the chair. He also agreedthat the Committee should report direct to the War Cabinet, andthat a Secretary should be found from the War Cabinet Secretariat.Finally, he would ask for a ruling as to whether the Halseyproposals should be accepted as a basis on which the Committeeshould work, or whether these proposals should be open to review.On this point he would like to say that the Halsey Report was sentto the Treasury by the Admiralty on the 21st May. The Admiraltyproposals in regard to it were sent to&apos;him on the 11th of the present month. The Air Force proposals were sent to the Treasury&apos;&apos; on the5th June, being the Thursday before Whit Monday. They had,therefore, been in the possession of the Treasury just a fortnight,including the Whitsuntide -Bank Holiday. It was stated in theSecretary of State&apos;s covering memorandum that the proposals hadbeen &quot; framed independently of the Jerram proposals for the Navy,and are put forward on their own merits.&quot; In the official letter fromthe Air Ministry to the Treasury it was stated that &quot; the proposals are based on the recommendations of the Jerram Committee for the pay of the Navy.&quot; He had reason to know that the previousrecommendations of the Air Ministry Committee on rates of pay for officers were scrapped in consequence of the Jerram Report.Mr. Churchill, interposing, said that it was true that theJerram Report was in the hands of the Committee, but he bad cometo the conclusion that the present proposals were good in themselves.They were based on what officers were now receiving, and hadreceived before the war, and also on what was likely to be requiredto induce suitable recruits to join the service.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, continuing, said that boththe Naval and Air Force proposals necessarily involved an immenseamount of complicated detail. In consequence of allowances in kind,separation allowances and the like, the scale of pay proposed neverrepresented the real emoluments of the officer or man concerned, andwas never comparable with the rates of pay ruling in civilian life.It had not been possible for either the Financial Secretary or himself,or for the Department, to make  anything  like  an  exhaustive
1   &apos; .examination of the proposals in the time at their disposed. The AirForce proposals for other ranks alone comprised seven groups on different scales, in addition to a series of non-substantive rates of pay. He recognised that the high rates of pay accorded to the non-commissioned ranks of the Navy necessarily affected the rates to belaid down for the Army and the Air Force, and that we could notescape from the standard already established, but he would like tobe assured that the rates proposed for the Air Force;, all things beingtaken into consideration, were not more than equivalent, Mutatis Mutandis, to those sanctioned for the Navy. He was not clear thatthis was the case. As a small example he might say that the correct pay of a corporal in the Air Force did not correspond with acorporal in the Marines. A corporal in the Marines received 5s. 6cZ.per diem, and in the Air Force a corporal (non-technical) 5s. ; acorporal (administrative) 5s, 10d., plus higher separation allowances.Similar discrepancies existed in the case of shoemakers and tailors.He thought, therefore, that the rates should be carefully examinedthroughout from this point of view.Turning to the case of officers, he accepted the principle thatthe rates should be such as, without private means, to enable anofficer to live in a style proper to bis rank, having regard to thesocial position which that rank conferred, and to the attraction thusoffered to the Service. Something of the same attraction attachedto Civil Service under the Crown. Class I of the Civil Serviceentered after a severe competitive examination, and almost alwaysafter a University and Public School education of an expensivecharacter. Before the war their salary on entrance was 200Z. perannum. It might very probably be fixed at 300Z. after the war.The plums of the Civil Service were represented by positionscarrying salaries of 2,000Z., or, in perhaps two cases, -2,500Z., whichmight be raised post helium to 2,500Z. and 3,000Z. respectively.He was informed that a young man admitted as a solicitor at, or after, the age of 21 might get 150Z. to 2001. in the first year, and250Z., if he made good progress, in the second. Most youngbarristers probably did not make their expenses until they reachedthe age of 25 or 26. A young doctor just qualified at the age of24 would take a hospital appointment at 120Z. or 150Z. a year, withhis keep. He compared with these civilian employments the proposedscale of a lieutenant in the Navy, or a lieutenant in the Air Force.It was proposed that the Naval Lieutenant at the age of 22should receive 17s. a day, or 310Z. a year, rising after four years to20s., and after six years to 24s. a day. In addition, he had no rentto pay, had free food except for a mess deduction of 2s. a day, hisalcohol and tobacco were free of duty, and he was provided with aservant free and with free medical attendance, with railway fares atcheap rates, and with various allowances for special duties at a rateof Is. a day if he&apos; was not a specialist, and, if he was a specialist orin command, from 2s. 6cZ. upwards. The Admiralty figure forlodgings and compensation when an officer was in employmentashore was 84Z. per annum for lodging, and 80Z. for provisions, fuel and light, with a special addition in the case of London. He thusestimated the real pay of the lieutenant aged 22 on 17s. a. day asbeing .. ....  . - -     :,r17s. a day   ...           ... ... 310 a year.Lodging      ...           ... ... 102     ,,Provisions, &amp;c.           ... ...         80     ,,Special Allowance, say ...         25     ,,Medical  Attendance  and other advantages         ... ...         10     ,,He thus received a minimum of 537Z. a year. If he hadchildren he received allowances in respect of them. It should further be remembered that he had been educated largely at the
public expense, and that pensions were obtainable at a comparativelyearly age.The Air Force Lieutenant, aged 21 to 25, was to receive 23s. aday, or 42 OZ. a year, plus lodging, fuel, light, and rations. these were estimated by the Air Ministry on a pre-war basis as equal to4s. 3d. a day, making a total, at the age of 21, of 27s. 3d. a day,or 4971. 10s. a year. After two years the lieutenant was to receive an additional 2s. a day, making his pay, with allowances on thesame basis, 534Z.If, however, be calculated the value of the allowances, not asthe Air Ministry did, by their estimated pre-war cost, but on theAdmiralty scale of the equivalent in cash to be paid to an officer who did not draw them in kind (and the Air Ministry had warnedus that where cash was paid 4s. 3cZ. a day would not be sufficient),the pay of a lieutenant at 21 was 420Z. a year, and the value of the allowance about 1751., bringing his real emoluments up to 600Z.He submitted that the rates proposed in both cases wereexcessive, having regard to what the same men would earn in civil life. He submitted, further, that it was both bad economy for theState and bad policy for the Services to pay very young men out ofall proportion to what they could earn at a later time. The result would be that they would have more money than they would know what to do with as bachelors, would be encouraged to accustomthemselves to a style of living which they could not maintain asmarried men, and in fhe later stage of their career would find themselves severely pinched and be very discontented.Under the circumstances bhe best proposal he could make tothe Cabinet was that they should fix a standard rate of remunerationsuitable for lieutenants, that the rate so fixed by the Cabinet shouldbe reduced to the equivalent rate of pay by a Committee who woulddeduct from the standard emoluments the value of what was supplied in kind;. that this Committee should further be directed to revise the rates of the senior officers in the light of the Cabinet decision asto the junior rank, but should be informed that the Cabinet did not insist upon proportionate reduction among senior officers, who werefewer in number and might be expected to have greater responsi-bilities both in the Service and in their family relations ; that itshould be an instruction to the Committee that the special rates of income tax were to cease as from the close of this financial year,as proposed by the Admiralty, and that the allowance of specialrates for travelling when not on duty and when not proceeding to orfrom leave should be reconsidered. Fie thought that this revisionmight be carried out by the same Committee which would revise the pay of the other ranks on the basis cf the Cabinet decision for theNavy. He did not insist, however, that the proposed Committeeshould take as the value of emoluments in kind the precise valuethat he had attached to them. He would like to mention, although he knew that the Chiefs of the Air Force were doing all they could to combat it, that much harm had resulted in Air Force officershaving too much money.The First Lord of the Admiralty said: that he was not preparedto admit that it .was legitimate to draw a comparison between the pay received in civil life and the equivalent received in the Nav)?.It had to be remembered that, whateverwere the difficulties of civilians,comparison was impossible because (1) if a civilian had brains he might at a very early age considerably improve his financial position ; and(2) when the civilian was young he was his own master. This didnot apply to the Naval officers, who were never their own masters.The Chancellor of the Exchequer had referred to the evil results ofofficers having too much money. He was sceptical on this point,and in the case of the Navy it was certainly the reverse. Cases had come before him which, if the sufferers had chosen to takeadvantage of &quot;their many opportunities to let their miseries be. known,would have scandalised the country, and would not have been
tolerated by the House of Commons. Scores of Naval officers -werein debt and their wives inadequately provided for. This was notthe position of affairs we wanted. He accepted the Committee that had been suggested, but was ready at the same time to defend thefigures that had been put forward by the Naval authorities. these had received most careful examination, and he would like to pointout to the Cabinet that the feeling of discontent among the officers at the delay in dealing with this question was very marked. he hoped that if the Committee was appointed it would report in aweek or ten days, as suggested by the Secretary of State for Air.Any delay would be fraught with grave dangers. The figures forthe Navy showed that income tax would be charged to officers, andit was desirable that the practice as to income tax should be uniformthroughout the fighting Services.The Under-Secretary for Air said that the position, so far as theAir Force was concerned, was special. He agreed that the Admiralty,the War Office, and the Air Force proposals should be considered asa whole, but strongly urged that there should be a time limit givento the Committee, The state of the Air Force was critical, and theposition serious from the point of view of our home services and thesmall wars abroad. During the past few weeks he had visitedeighteen different Air Stations, and had been much impressed by the unsatisfactory state of affairs. Owing to the delay regarding thepermanent pay of the Air Force they had lost many of their bestmechanics and were short of strength to meet the demands made upon them. He feared that the shortage of mechanics would cause a great expenditure, in the Afghan War. Because of this shortageof mechanics, fatalities in the air had risen alarmingly, and since theArmistice a total of 1,222* lives had been lost. It meant thataeroplanes went into the air without being properly tuned up. Inaddition, there was a great shortage of riggers. Riggers were highly paid in civil life, and now wanted to return to it. This helped to account for the loss of life. If, however, the future rates of pay ofthe Air Force were properly fixed, he felt convinced that they would obtain the good officers required by the Force, and the mechanics, onwhose efficiency every life depended. He asked, however, that theReport should be made within a specified period, and he thought ten days was sufficient.Mr. Bonar Law said the Cabinet had no doubt as to the advisability of appointing the Committee suggested by the Secretaryof State for Air. Only two points, therefore, remained for decision : (1.) The time within which the Committee should be asked tomake a Report ;(2.) The suggestion of the Chancellor &quot;of the Exchequer thatthe War Cabinet should now rule that the rates of the junior officers were in any event too high.With regard to (1) he felt that it would be difficult to ask theCommittee to report in a limited time, and he was sure they couldrely on the President of the Board of Education to report at theearliest moment. With regard to (2) he was of opinion that, as theCabinet would not be committed by the Report of the Committee,they might well leave the question as to the rates of pay for junior officers to the Committee. He would like to refer to the Under-Secretary of State for Air&apos;s remarks with regard to the great number of &quot;fatalities in the air since the Armistice. The figures were indeed alarming, and he did not think the country realised* Note. The Secretary of State for War has since issued a Memorandum(G.T.-7o38), in which he states&apos; that this figure, includes death from all causes,including influenza, &amp;c, which had occurred in the Koyal Air Force since theArmistice. The total number of flying casualties at home and abroad since theArmistice up to the 31st May last, is now shown to be 263. Acting Secretary, WarCabinet.[826]-734 C
their significance when General Seely made a statement on thesubject in the House of Commons a little while back. He felt most strongly that instructions should be issued to all officers commandingaerodromes that they were not to allow flights in machines that wereunsafe ; Commanding Officers should be held responsible for carryingout these instructions; the pilots could not be relied upon to do thisthemselves, as they would go up in any machine, whether it wassafe or not.The Chief of the Air Staff agreed that the state of the aerodromes in England was very bad. This was due, in a great measure, to the officers and men of the Royal Air Force not knowingthe Rates of Pay and the Terms of Service. Officers and men feltthat they did not know whether they could stop in the Royal AirForce or not, and regular officers were of the opinion that theymight lose by not applying to go back to their parent services.This had caused the Royal Air Force to lose a very large number ofboth officers and men.All the necessary steps were being taken to prevent machinesgoing into the air that were not airworthy; but this practice was due to the lack of good officers and air mechanics.It was admitted that discipline had deteriorated badly owingto the delay in putting the Royal Air Force on a proper footing.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he felt bound to pointout that the delay referred to by the Chief of the Air Staff couldnot be laid at the door either of the War Cabinet or the Treasury.As he bad already pointed out, the pay proposals had only beenreceived from the Air Ministry a week or ten days ago, and reason-able time must be allowed for consideration.The War Cabinet decided - (a.) To appoint a Committee, consisting of two representativesof the Treasury, the Admiralty, the War Office, and theAir Ministry, under the chairmanship of the Presidentof the Board of Education, to co-ordinate the proposalsof these Departments with regard to pay.(b.) That the Chief of the Air Staff should issue instructionsto officers commanding aerodromes forbidding the use of aeroplanes that had not been thoroughly tested and found sound.First Report ofCommittee onNationalExpenditure :Official Cars.2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he would like totake this opportunity of drawing the attention of the Air ministry to the report of the Committee on Expenditure. In this reportreference had been made to the number of motor-cars used by theAir Ministry headquarters. He wished to inquire if the Air Ministrywere taking steps to reply to the criticism made against them.The Chief of the Air Staff replied that a report on this subject was now being drafted and would be circulated very shortly. Hewould like to add, however, that the number of motors used by thestaff of the Air Ministry was being reduced rapidly.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,June 19, 1919.
APPENDIX.My dear Chancellor of the Exchequer, June 18, 1919.RECOGNISING the difficulties inseparable from the co-ordination of complicatedscales of pay between the various departments, I pi-opose to you the following definitesteps for immediate action, which I suggest should in principle be adopted by theCabinet to-morrow : 1. The Jerram report and the Board of Admiralty recommendation thereon arealready before the Treasury ; General Trenchard&apos;s proposals for the pay of the AirForce have also been for some days in the hands of the Treasury; the War office proposals for the army are now completed, and are being printed this afternoon. Theyare later than the others, but this is perhaps inevitable since they are to some extentconsequent upon them.2. An Inter-Departmental Committee should be appointed to co-ordinate these three proposals, with instructions to report to the Cabinet within a week orten days.3. This Committee should be composed as follows : Two representatives of each of the Departments concerned, viz., the Treasury,the Admiralty, the War Office, and the Air Ministry.The War Office representatives will be The Financial Secretary, Mr. Forster, andThe Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff, General Harington.The Air Ministry representatives will be Lord Londonderry, andGeneral Trenchard.* 4. This Committee will not be able to work without the guidance of a Minister,and 1 propose that an impartial Minister should be chosen. I suggest that Sir auckland geddes should be asked to undertake this work.In view of the prime interest of the Treasury in these matters I suggest that theFinancial Secretary to the Treasury should also be a member. I would ask that oneof the Secretaries of the War Cabinet should act as secretary, and that the Committeeshould report to the War Cabinet direct.5. It is indispensable to the useful action of this -Committee that the cabinet should give a ruling to-morrow on the following points, viz., whether the Jerramproposals as put forward by the Admiralty are to be taken as the foundation,or whether they are to be revised in accordance with the proposals putforward by the other two services. I consider myself that they should in certain respects be capable of revision, as otherwise they impose upon the army ratesof pay which we think in certain cases are in excess of what is necessary to providefor the public service. It must also be remembered that the great risks of flyingrequire in time of peace a certain advantage over army rates ; and thus, if army rates are pushed up not indeed to the same level as the naval proposals, for that we donot suggest but in a certain relation to them, these army rates react in their turnupon the Air Force rates, especially in the junior ranks, and may from that causerequire certain increases in the flying rates, which up to the present have been fixedmainly in regard to the merits, i.e., what it will cost us to get the officers and menwhat they are getting now, and what they got before the war.My proposal therefore is that the Committee as constituted should take the wholeof these proposals of the three Services into hotchpotch. They cannot, of course, startout on the whole enquiry de novc, but they can at any rate shake the whole thingtogether and produce a practical solution which safeguards as far as possible the interestsof the taxpayer. -6. I would impress upon you that within certain limits, which I think are more orless fixed by the circumstances of the time, the purchasing power of money, &amp;c, any decision is better than a continuance of the present uncertainty. I really cannotundertake to continue to be responsible for the Royal Air Force while it is being
absolutely rotted and disintegrated through the prolonged uncertainty in regard to every condition affecting the future of officers and men. Post-war numbers still remain under control, but post-war rates and conditions must be settled. To say this, is in no way to complain of any delay on the part of the Treasury; the delay which has takenplace is entirely due to the complicated nature of the subject and to the inherentdifficulties of the times.I trust these proposals will command your support.
