The Prime Minister said that, in an interview which hehad had with His Majesty, the King expressed the hope that itmight be possible for Thanksgiving Services to be held on thefollowing Sunday, as he was afraid that, if the Services werepostponed for another six weeks, it might look as if the nationwas not particularly anxious to give thanks for the signing ofthe Peace. He had received two or three telephone messagessince from Buckingham Palace confirming the King&apos;s view, andalso a message from the Archbishop of Canterbury in the same sense, and he  wondered if it were not yet possible, in theB
circumstances, to advance the dates of the celebrations by. two orthree weeks.Lord Curzon, speaking as Chairman of the Peace;Celebrations Committee of the War Cabinet, said that therecommendations of his Committee, which had given the wholequestion their most careful consideration, wiere that Peacecelebrations should not take place until the first week in August.These recommendations had been submitted to and approved byPlis Majesty, after their consideration by the War Cabinet. Hehad kept His Majesty fully informed, from time to time, of theprogress made by his Committee, and the King had expressedsatisfaction with the projected arrangements. Lord Curzon saidthat there was no desire on the part of himself or his Committeeto have the celebrations, as they doubted whether the occasionreally justified extensive rejoicing. At the same time his committee were aware, from a great mass of correspondencewhich had been received from various quarters, that the peoples of the Empire had a strong desire to celebrate Peace. Theproposals of his Committee were not on an unduly extravagantscale, but they required careful preparation and organisation.The arrangements, for instance, for the military -processions andfor the naval display could not be properly carried out in a hurry.This was the first time that, on an occasion like this, any attempthad been made to recognise the services of the Navy on a bigscale. It was highly desirable that the celebrations should besimultaneous throughout the Empire, and organised. Even anapparently simple matter like the holding of thanksgivingservices required considerable thought and preparation if theywere to be duly impressive. Moreover, it had been proposed topermit open-air services to be held, and the necessary arrangements for these would take time. He was, of course,quite prepared to modify the Committee&apos;s proposals to meet thewishes of His Majesty and the Prime Minister; at the same time,he felt that there would be great and widespread disappointmentif the arrangements made fell short of popular expectation.The First Lord of the Admiralty and Sir Eric Geddes laid stress on the fact that the Empire was counting much uponadequate recognition being given, to the services of the Navy inthe forthcoming celebrations.Mr. Bonar Law said that one of the reasons why the cabinet had approved of the suggested dates, was that they recognised thedesirability of having the celebrations simultaneous throughoutthe Empire.After a brief discussion, the War Cabinet decided that: Lord Curzon should acquaint His Majesty, either in a personal interview or through the King&apos;s private secretary, with the reasons which had guided the PeaceCelebrations Committee in fixing, and the War Cabinetin approving, the proposed dates for Peace celebrations,and also with the difficulties in the way, at the present justice, of altering the arrangements for thosecelebrations which were already well-advanced; and that lord Curzon should communicate the result of his interview to the War Cabinet at the earliest possible date.The Enabling Bill. 2. With reference to Paper H.A.C.-30, Minute 2, the WarCabinet had a short discussion on the National Assembly of theChurch of England (Powers) Bill (Paper G.T.-7308).Lord Curzon explained that the authorities of the Church ofEngland had for some time been very much concerned over theslowness of Parliamentary procedure in regard to Churchmatters, and the difficulty of passing through Parliament any
legislation connected with the domestic affairs of the Church. Ascheme had therefore been prepared, and was embodied in theBill, whereby the Church, in matters appertaining to its own internal government, obtained certain powers, subject to thecontrol of Parliament. The Bill had not been before the WarCabinet, but it had been considered fully by the Committee ofHome Affairs on May 28, when it was decided, subject to thePrime Ministers approval (1) that the Government should not accept the Bill in itspresent form:(2) that the Government should indicate sympathy with thedesire of the Church to carry out internal reformswith greater expedition and a greater sense of freedom, and the readiness of the Government tohelp to that end.The Bill had already received one day&apos;s debate in the Houseof Lords, and its second reading would be continued on thefollowing day and probably two or three days afterwards. TheArchbishops, the Bishops and representatives of practically everyshade of opinion in the House would probably take part in the debate. On the side representing the majority of the Housethere was a very strong feeling in favour of the Bill, or, at all events, of the principles underlying the Bill, and it wouldprobably obtain a second reading. He doubted, however, if itwould proceed further, and in any case he believed there was little likelihood of its passing the House of Commons. lord curzon went on to say that the Lord Chancellor, whom he had asked to represent in the House of Lords the attitude of theGovernment to. the Bill, had taken great trouble to prepare a speech on the subject, the notes of which he (Lord Curzon) had seen. The speech in certain aspects expressed very strong opposition to the Bill, and, if delivered, would embarrass members on the Government Bench who might desire to vote for the Bill,and whom he (Lord Curzon) did not wish to prevent from sovoting. Further, certain Peers would in any case vote infavour of the measure, and it might be that, in spite of the lord chancellor&apos;s opposition, the Bill would obtain a second reading and the Government be defeated. He had therefore thought it right to suggest to the Lord Chancellor that he might couch hiscriticism in less forcible terms and modify the strongcondemnation of the Bill which was shown in his speech; andwith the sanction of the War Cabinet he proposed not to put onthe Government Whips and to allow the House to vpte as itwished.The Lord Chancellor said that, when this subject was firstraised, he had no very strongi views either way. He merelydesired to have the views of the Government as a whole so thathe should know what line to take in the House of Lords, and itwas at his suggestion that the Bill had been considered by theCommittee . of Home Affairs, who had come to the decisionreferred to by Lord Curzon. Having, however, ascertained theviews of the Committee as expressed in this decision, he had gonewith great care into the Bill itself and the speeches delivered infavour of it at the first day&apos;s debate, and he had now reached theconclusion that the Bill was a thoroughly bad one and somethingless than candid. It was engineered by a small body of men inthe Church who had in view a purpose which was not represented in the Bill. It compromised the whole position of the NationalChurch and the question of Disestablishment. He, however,had no strong feeling in favour of forcing a Division on thesecond reading, and he would be glad to revise the terms of his speech in the way suggested.The Prime Minister pointed out that the Bill was by nomeans a Bill of the Church as a whole, rather, it was promoted by that party in the Church which desired more power for&apos; the
ecclesiastical section. The Church was itself divided on the&quot;question, and the present was only a phase of a struggle whichhad been going on for centuries. He saw no reason why theGovernment should take sides in the matter at all, nor why anymember of the Government should not express his own opinion in debate and vote as he liked.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that this procedure had been followed before in the case of the FranchiseBill.The War Cabinet decided To ask the Lord Chancellor to reconsider the terms in whichhe proposed to deal with the matter, and to allow membersof the House of Lords complete freedom of action inrespect of their attitude towards the Enabling Bill. -Obtaining of Sup-plies by Wives and families of naval officers and Men.3. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the First Lord of the Admiralty (Paper G.T.-7528) on thequestion of affording facilities to the wives and families of naval officers and men for obtaining supplies from canteen shops situateoutside Naval barracks in the home ports. It was proposed thatcanteen shops should be established outside the barracks, at whichthe wives and families of naval officers and men should be permitted to deal.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the proposal toestablish canteen shops would, no doubt, raise the question of competition with local tradesmen. The proposal would be limitedto a very few towns, where at present advantage was being takenby the local tradespeople to exact high prices from sailors&apos; wives.He desired to point out that the wives of sailors were at a disadvantage as compared with soldiers&apos; wives, since the navalcanteens were on board ship and they could not go to them.There were also reasons why it was undesirable to permit sailors&apos;wives to deal at the canteens inside the naval barracks.The Food Controller said that undoubtedly the proposal would arouse the hostility of the private trader and of theco-operative societies. He had always objected to&apos; givingpreferential treatment to special classes of the community. Ifthe argument was that the privilege of obtaining commodities atlow prices was taken into account in assessing the value of navalpay and allowances, the obvious answer was to increase the pay.The Ministry of Food had been pressed to establish shops under its own control, in order to safeguard the consumer againstextortionate prices, and this they had resisted. If these canteenshops were set up it could only be by arrangement with the LocalFood Committees, which was bound to arouse opposition not only from the shopkeeper and the co-operative societies, but also fromthe general consumer., if, as was anticipated, commodities couldbe purchased in the naval canteen shops at lower prices thanelsewhere.Mr. Barnes said that the proposal was certain to increasethe hostility of shopkeepers. Moreover, the towns principally concerned-Plymouth, Portsmouth and Chatham were those where the Co-operative Societies were strong and would certainlygive trouble.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, in view of theobjections raised, which he appreciated, he would, see whether some other wav could not be found to meet the difficulty.The War Cabinet decided Not to adopt the Admiralty proposals.Scheme of out-of-WorkDonation.4. With reference to War Cabinet 562 (Minute 3, the WarCabinet took note of the Interim Report of the Committee ofEnquiry into the scheme of out-of-work donation (Paper G.-250).
Unemployment andthe State of Trade.A   *X 1Holding of land and carrying on ofBusiness by formerAlien Enemies.[8]6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary (Paper G.T.-7581) on the holding of land and carrying on of business by-Germans and other former alien enemies.Notice nad been given by six members of the House of commons of amendments to the Aliens Restriction Bill, to provide that noformer enemy alien should be entitled to acquire or hold land, orany interest in land, in the United Kingdom, to carry on anybusiness in the United Kingdom which might be certified by thePresident of the Board of Trade to be a key industry, or to holdany share in any company carrying on such business, or in anycompany owning a British ship. &quot;The Home Secretary stated that if the amendments were accepted they would involve a complete reversal of the law as itat present stood. They would doubtless meet with considerablesympathy and support in the House of Commons, but he did notthink the Government should accept them in a temporary AliensBill. If anything of the kind were to be done, it should be by wayof amendment to the &quot;British Nationality and Status of aliens act, 1914.&quot; This Act provided specifically that aliens might holdland. It was now proposed, by inserting an amendment in thepresent Bill, which was only a temporary measure taking effectduring the ensuing twelve months, to make a change in thegeneral law.Mr. Bonar Law pointed out that the feeling in the House ofCommons against enemy aliens was far from subsiding.Mr. Barnes said that he desired to resist the amendment on general principles. In his opinion the time would come when weshould be ashamed of the restrictions we sought to impose onformer enemies. He was equally opposed to a temporary restric-tion of the same kind. If the proposals were necessary at all they would be necessary in 15 or 20 years. He noticed that theGermans were also prohibited from acquiring any share in a keyindustry. So far as he was aware, a &quot;key industry&quot; had never been defined and was incapable of definition.The Secretary of State for the Colonies enquired whetherit was possible to make a distinction between the countries withwhich we had been at war and all other aliens. He thought thatit would be very difficult to justify the imposition of further restrictions and to begin, immediately after the conclusion of a peace Treaty, by leislating against our former enemies. He found it difficult to find a moral basis for such a policy.The Prime Minister pointed out that the amendment would affect those who were technically our enemies but had in fact beenfriendly the Yugo-Slavs, Czechs, the Transylvanians. Poles andAlsatians and would have to be in a different form, viz., that noGermans, Turks or Bulgarians should be allowed to hold land.He suggested that it might be possible to impose the restrictionfor a period, and thought there was a good deal to be said for that point of view.Mr. Bonar Law agreed that there was much to be said forimposing such a restriction in the transitional stage.The President of the Board of Trade pointed out that, even ifthe restriction were imposed only for a short period, it might giverise to administrative difficulty. There were a considerablenumber of enemy aliens who owned private house property. this had been under supervision under the control of the Board of- .      ,    &apos;     :&apos;- . v. &apos; C5. With reference to War Cabinet 588, Minute 4, the WarCabinet took note of a Report by the Minister of Reconstructioninto the question of rehabilitating trade and providing employ-ment (Paper G.-237), together with a summary of the variousdecisions taken and recommendations made in the Report (paper g AY
Trade, but had not been liquidated. The Government had theright to seize it for indemnities, though it was doubtful whether,under the Enemy Debts scheme,it would be needed.The Home Secretary enquired what would be the position of house property : would the houses be taken away %The Prime Minister pointed out that under the Treaty ofPeace with Germany we should confiscate all private propertyowned in this country by Germans, and the German Governmentwould indemnify the owners.The President of the Board of Trade said that if the periodof one year were agreed to it should not be difficult to make thenecessary alterations to bring the amendments into line with theprovisions of the Treaty of Peace. But the difficulty would notbe entirely met by the confiscation of property owned in thiscountry by Germans before the War. They would be indemnifiedby their Government, and might seek, out of the proceeds of the indemnity, to buy land. Was it proposed to say that they shouldnot live here and acquire property ?Sir Eric Geddes was of opinion that a temporary measureimposing restrictions for one year would be effective.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that the amend-ments were proposed largely because it was felt that before theWar the Germans had taken every advantage of opportunities toacquire property and businesses in this country, and it was only right that our people should have the first consideration.The Prime Minister said that the proposals arose from thedegitimate sentiment that the German people had devastated,slaughtered and ravaged in the countries of Europe, and that this must be taken into account before permitting them to holdproperty in this country. It was necessary to make some pro-vision for the ensuing year. Even the strongest advocates of theLeague of Nations had felt that the Germans could not yet beadmitted to it, and that time must be allowed. He agreed thatit would be very undesirable to allow the Germans to acquire landduring the next twelve months. If the Germans were wise theywould not come here at all, and, in fact, he did not think theywould. If the Government refused to adopt some restriction of.this kind it would be more likely to hinder the process of -peacethan to promote it.The War Cabinet decided To authorise the Home Secretary to accept amendments tothe Aliens Restriction Bill on the lines of those set out inhis Memorandum (Paper G.T.-7581), provided thatthey were limited in operation to the period of one year after the passing of the Bill and were not inconsistent with the Treaty of Peace.(Mr. Barnes desired that Ms dissent from this decision should be recorded.)Salaries of Scientific 7. With reference to War Cabinet 576, Minute 2, the Warand Technical Cabinet took note of   the following Treasury Minute,  datedOfficers. june 27, 1919 :-&quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer states to the board that he has been requested by the War Cabinet to set up atemporary Committee to examine, in consultation with theDepartments concerned, the question of the salaries to be offered to scientific and technical officers whom it is desiredto employ in the Government service.   The Chancellor of the
Exchequer proposes that the Committee be constituted asfollows : Sir   Thomas   Heath,   K.C.B.,   K.C.V.O.,   F.R.S.(Chairman),Sir James J. Dobbie, LL.D., D.Sc., F.R.S.,Professor Arthur Schuster, LL.D., So.D., F.R.S.,with two other members varying with -the particular department concerned, one being a representative of that department and the other the Principal Clerk of the Divisionof the Treasury which deals with correspondence from that department.   My Lords approve.&quot;Indian Beforms.Composition of theSelect Committee ofboth Houses.8. With reference to War Cabinet 567, Minute 6, theSecretary of State for India said he wished to raise a point inregard to the composition of the Select Committee of both Houses,wnich was to be appointed to consider the Government of IndiaBill. There were to be seven members appointed by each House,to form the Committee, and the question of the members to be selected had been discussed at various times by himself and the leader of the House of Lords. He had, of course, no objectionat all to well-known opponents of the Bill being appointed to theCommittee. He felt bound, however, to protest against onenominee of the House of Lords, who, he had heard the previousweek, was to be one of the seven members representing that House.The noble Lord in question, Lord Sydenham, was well known tohold very strong and uncompromising views on the subject of the contemplated reforms in the government of India, and he feared that, when it was known in India that he was to be a member ofthe Committee, even the moderate party in that country wouldtake the view that the British Government did not really intend to see the Bill through.Lord Curzon thought that the Secretary of State for Indiaattached undue importance to the possible influence that LordSydenham might exert upon the Committee. He had constantlydiscussed the composition of that Committee with Mr. Montagu,and they had both been actuated by a desire to make it an impartial body. In suggesting names of members of theCommittee to represent the Upper House he had been especiallycareful to recommend such men as would best represent the various sections of opinion in that House. The Secretary of State forIndia from the very outset had himself invited the frankest criti-criticism and alternative proposals from all sections of public opinion;and he himself was confident, as he had said, that Mr. Montaguheld an exaggerated view of Lord Sydenham&apos;s possible influence on the Committee.[There then followed a general discussion on the composition ofthe Committee.)The Prime Minister said that a short time previously theAga Khan and the Maharaja of Bikanir had come to see him inorder to discuss Indian Reforms. Their view whether rightor wrong was that the Committee, in respect of the representa-tives of the House of Lords, was &quot;packed,&quot; and that theserepresentatives were distinctly prejudiced against the proposedreforms. They were, in fact, much disturbed at the prospect ofthe Committee containing so many men whose attitude they feltwould be the reverse of sympathetic; and they had said to him.that, if the Bill were not passed, or if it were altered, as they feared, out of all recognition, there would be very serious trouble in India.    They further expressed the view that British, apart
from Indian, public opinori would not tolerate what, they niain-tained, was the denial of justice to India. There was, of course,no objection to hostile opinion being represented on the Committee;but if that hostility were to be overwhelming there was bound tobe very great resentment.Lord Curzon said there was no question, in his mind ofrepresentatives of the Upper House going to the Committee with pre-judged opinions. He contended that it was infinitely pre-transferable to give such criticism as would be offered a full outlet in committee, than to have it obstructing the Bill when it came before the House of Lords. He was aware that there was con-siderable opposition to the principle of dualism, and naturallycertain amendments must be expected. He had, however, alwaysintended to make a special appeal to the members of his Housewho might be selected to serve on the Committee to preservestrict impartiality and to weigh the Bill on its merits.Mr. Bonar Law said that he understood that Lord Sydenhamhad already been asked to serve on the Committee, and matters had therefore gone too far for the War Cabinet to intervene. all they could do now was to try their utmost to remove the miscon-ception that the members of the Committee were Governmentselections and not merely representatives of public opinion in both Houses.The Secretary of State for India said that, as it appeared that Lord Sydenham&apos;s appointment was a fait accompli, he had nothing further to say.The War Cabinet took note of the statements of the Secretaryof State for India and the Leader of the House of Lords.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,June 30, 1919.o
