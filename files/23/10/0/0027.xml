M. Evans, Assistant Secretary/.Civil Employmentof Eetired Officers :Draft Bill.[826]-7171. The War Cabinet had under consideration the draft of a Bill(Paper G.T.-7458) to enable the rules as to the civil employment of retired officers to be revoked or modified in so far as they providefor deductions from civil pay.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that this was a treasury Bill, and explained that, under existing conditions, when are tired officer took civil employment a deduction was made from hiscivil salary to the extent of 10 per cent. Such officers, conse-quently,, tended to seek work elsewhere than in GovernmentDepartments,^ and, after consultation with his colleagues, he had come to the conclusion that a Bill on the lines of the draft now before the Cabinet was both desirable and necessary.The Assistant Financial Secretary of the War Office enquire whether it was intended to lay down the principle that in no cases would deductions be made ; if so, certain anomalies were bound to arise. He agreed that the rules, as they stand also prodimedanomalies and should be revised. In the old days, for instance,deductions had been made in the case of officers employed in one part of Nigeria, and not in the Case of officers employed in the other :this was due to the fact that one part of the country was payingits way and the other was drawing money from the Exchequer.At the present day, retired officers would be accepting employment on- the strength of special knowledge which they had acquired whilst
Food Supplies forthe Inhabitants ofthe occupied territories ofGermany.2. With reference to War Cabinet 574, Minute 5, the WarCabinet resumed the discussion of the question of the food supplies for the inhabitants of the occupied territories of Germany.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in accordance withthe decision of the Cabinet when the question had been previouslydiscussed, he had endeavoured to raise the question with- theBritish Representatives in Paris, but nothing had been settled. Thepresent position was not satisfactory, and he would be glad of anearly decision on the subject.Lord Curzon observed, with regard to the proposal to give ahigher scale of food to the inhabitants of the occupied territories of Germany, that lie understood the argument was raised on behalfof our soldiers, and not of the inhabitants themselves.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that in March last telegram had been received, when he was in Paris, from GeneralPiumer, wdio was at that time commanding the Second Army onthe Rhine, drawing attention to the growing discontent among oursoldiers on account of starving women and children in the occupiedarea.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had receivedfrom the Prime Minister a copy of General Piumer&apos;s telegram, witha request that he would go into the question. He had consultedwith the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, and had subsequentlywirod to Paris to the effect that he had agreed that, as the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff bad represented that the matter was serious and urgent, surplus army stores might be sent to GeneralPiumer for the use of the inhabitants of the occupied territories.On the 18th of the following month a. telegram bad come from the headquarters of the British army of the Rbine, concluding with thewords that it was essential for military reasons that an adequate supply should be provided for these inhabitants.Lord Curzon enquired whether the French were making similar provision. .The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he did not think thiswas the case with the French, but it was so wb h the Americans. Asa matter of fact, our armies were occupying the area where localsupplies, were most limited. The rations which the military authoritiesconsidered indisjoensable in that area were 31 per cent, higher thanthe Germans received elsewhere. The German Central Government,although it showed every sign of keeping the Brussels agreement in regard to the payment of expenses incurred on account of theoccupation of German terri ory by Allied troops, was not preparedto pay for the extra 31 per cent. The total monthly cost of theadditional ration in the British areas was some 460,000^. The localauthorities had undertaken to meet 60 per cent, of these charges,serving in the army. In practice it would be found difficult to draw a sharp line between military and civilian departments, especially inthe case of officers employed, for example, at Woolwich, but underthe Ministry of Munitions, a Civil department. He suggested,therefore, that, in view of these anomalies, it might be desirable notto make the Bill too rigid.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the original intentionhad been to revoke absolutely the rules as to the civil. employmentof retired officers.&apos; His Department would, however, consider care-fully the points raised by Sir Charles B arris before the Bill was introduced in Parliament.The War Cabinet decided To authorise the introduction of the Draft Bill, subject to such modifications as the Chancellor of the Exchequer might think it desirable to make in view of the points raised bythe Assistant Financial Secretary of the War Office.
and the Treasury representative in Paris, on the Supreme economic council, had agreed to accept the payment of this amount up to theend of May. The real difficulty was the balance, which amounted to184,000L per month.Lord Curzon enquired how long it would be necessary to meet this latter charge.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was impossible tosay, but he thought that the harvest would probably bring relief.(At this point the Deputy Director of Supplies, War Office, entered.)The Deputy Director of Supplies, War Office, said that instructions had been received from the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff in Paris, in March last, to earmark 31,000 tons of stores for the Second Army to distribute to the local inhabitants.9,000 tons of these had been sent up, and a telegram had then beenreceived from the Second Army saying that they could take no more.The despatch of the remainder had consequently been suspended.No reason had been given for holding: up the despatch of the rest ofthese stores, but it was probable that the existing organisation wasnot competent to deal with their distribution.Lord Curzon pointed out that the latest information on thesubject was two months old, and he thought it was desirable to clear up the situation by enquiring of the Officer Commanding theBritish Army of the Rhine what the position was at the presentmoment.The War Cabinet decided that -(a.) It was desirable to ascertain from the Commander of theBritish Army on the Rhine (i.) What the present position was, and if he stillpressed for the extra 31 per cent. ?(ii.) The reason for stopping the despatch of theremainder of the 31,000 tons of stores.(b.) The Chancellor of the Exchequer should draft a telegram in the above sense, for the War Office to send to general robertson.3. With reference to War Cabinet 550, Minute 3, the WarCabinet had before them a Report by the Sub-Committee of theInter-Departmental Committee on the Application of the WhitleyReport to Government Establishments (Paper G.-238), together witha Memorandum by the Minister of Labour covering the Report ofthe National Provisional Joint Committee (Paper G.-247) on thesame subject.The Minister of Labour stated in his Memorandum that a Sub-Committee of the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Applicationof the Whitley Report to Government Establishments presented adraft scheme to the Cabinet on the 7th March, 1919, which was approved, after which the scheme was referred to a conference ofrepresentatives of Government Departments and. of Civil ServiceAssociations, held at Caxton Hall, Westminster, on the 8th April.At this conference a resolution was adopted remitting the drafv.scheme to the National Joint Committee. The Report of theNational Joint Committee laid down that the main objects ofestablishing joint Whitley bodies for the Departments were (1.) To secure a greater measure of co-operation between theState in its capacity as employer and the general body ofCivil Servants in matters affecting the Civil Service,with a view to increased efficiency in the Public Servicecombined with the well-being of those employed.[826]-717 B 2Application of the whitley Report tothe AdministrativeBranches of theCivil Service.
(2.) To provide machinery ior dealing with grievances and generally to bring together the experience and differentpoints of view of representatives of the administrative,clerical, and manipulative Civil Service.The Minister of Labour, in his Memorandum, then proceeded to summarise the main points in the Report, expressing a hope that theCabinet would see their way to sanction the proposals at an earlydate, so that the necessary invitations to the National Conference(which was provisionally fixed for the 3rd July) might be issued.The War Cabinet decided &apos;. To adopt the recommendations contained in the Report of theNational Provisional Joint Committee on the Application ofthe Whitley Report to the Administrative Branches of theCivil Service (Paper G.-247).Publication of report of theIrish-AmericanDelegates.4. The Secretary of State ,for the Colonies stated that the&quot; Daily Telegraph &quot; had obtained a copy of the report of the Irish-American delegates to Ireland, which was a very sensationaldocument, and desired to know if they might publish it.Lord Curzon pointed out that a full summary of the reportappeared in that mornings &quot;Times,&quot; and, as it was already published in Paris, there appeared to be no reason to prevent its publicationhere.The War Cabinet decided To take no steps to restrict the publication of the report..Grants in Aid ofthe Blind.5. With reference to War Cabinet 268, Minute 9, the WarCabinet had under consideration a memorandum by the President ofthe Local Government Board (Paper G.T.-7352) in which it was proposed that a grant of 125,000Z. should be made in aid of the blind of Great Britain, and that this sum should be disbursed by certain Approved Societies as set out in Appendix (Bj of the above memorandum, under very careful regulations to be laid down bythe Local Government Board. The memorandum stated that a departmental Committee, under the chairmanship of Mr. HayesFisher, had, in July 1917, reported unanimously in favour of (a) theestablishment of a department in the Local Government Board fordealing with the blind ; (6) the provision of a capital sum of500,000Z. for the new central authority, and an annual grant of250,000Z., also for the central authority, to disburse in aid of various kinds of work ; and (c) the establishment of an Advisory Committeeand other matters. An Advisory Committee was set up underCabinet authority in December 1917 (War Cabinet 268, Minute 9),to advise Departments in the preparation of schemes for submission to the War Cabinet. The Committee had done a great deal of work,but the money necessary for carrying out their plans was not forth-coming, owing to the rt refusal of the Treasury to make any grants untillegislation had been passed. On the other hand, the Governmenthad, through Mr. Playes Fisher, pledged themselves to make earlyprovision for the blind. In the opinion of the President of the LocalGovernment Board, who had gone carefully into the matter, thedifficulties in the way of immediate legislation were insuperable. Inthe meantime, the Advisory Committee had threatened to resign,and Labour Members who were deeply concerned in this matter were very restless.   The proposal for a&apos; grant of 125,0001. hadthe Governmentsbecomingtherefore been put forward in order to redeem11 &quot;1*1 0pledges pending legislation.The President of the Local Government Board explained thatthe position was made more difficult on account of the large number
of people who had become blind through performing duties inconnection with the war. He himself would much prefer to wait until legislation bad been passed, but, in view of the Governmentspledges, an immediate grant should be made, and it was proposed todo this through Approved Institutions responsible to County.andBorough Councils. He hoped it would be possible to introduce legislation in the coming autumn, or at any rate next year.Lord Curzon stated that this matter had been considered bythe Home Affairs Committee (Paper H.A.C.-30, Minute 6) whostrongly urged that a grant should be made without waiting for legislation, in view of the Governments pledges.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that the Treasuryobjected to the proposal to make grants in anticipation of legislationwithout a proper scheme having been worked out. The proposal was being hurried through in order to meet existing agitation, and,in their view, to the prejudice of future schemes. In the&apos; previousJanuary the Treasury had written to the Local Government Board,as follows : &quot; They would not feel justified in starting on a policy ofassistance (for the blind) involving both immediate and prospective expenditure of very large amounts, without a priorsettlement of the principles in accordance with which therespective spheres of responsibility of local authorities and a central authority in dealing with the Government should be clearly laid down. Such a settlement cannot be arrived atwithout legislation, and they would deprecate most stronglyproviding funds without an Act being first passed which should deal exhaustively with the position of the blind and the methodsof treating and assisting them.&quot;They had added that the provision of such a grant would make it allthe more difficult to persuade local authorities to take their fair share in the provision of future help. Mr. Chamberlain went on to saythat Sir Arthur Pearson, with whom he had discussed this matter,had agreed with him that a dole would not give satisfaction to anyone, and it would be better to wait until legislation were passed.The President of the Local Government Board stated that, inhis discussion with the Advisory Council, the latter had pointed to the promises of the Government, to the work that had beencarried out, and to the preparations which had been made fordisbursing the grants, including the drawing up of a list of approved institutions, and it had been stated that a greatdeal of agitation would ensue unless grants were nowforthcoming to enable these institutions to proceed with theirschemes. With regard to legislation, the question of the blindcould not, be dealt with apart from the.whole question of the PoorLaw, as it would open up the question of the domiciliary positionof the blind ; and the Local Government Beard were not yet readywith proposals for dealing with the Poor Law. The present proposals for a. grant were limited to certain approved institutions,and these would be placed under the authority of County andBorough Councils, who would, no doubt, form the basis of the futureconsolidated health authorities. If this- year passed withoutanything being done, the Labour Party in particular would make aloud outcry. The Home Affairs Committee had come to the conclusionthat, in view of the specific pledges on behalf of. the Government, theproposed grant of 125,000L was the least that could be given without.prejudicing the future position ; and this was only half of what theAdvisory Council had asked for. Replying to questions by lord curzon, Dr. Addison said that if the Government did not make a granthe was quite convinced there would be a great outcry and we wouldhave to give way. The Institutions themselves had not the moneywith which to carry out their plans. If the Government had beenable to legislate in. the matter this Session the cost to the State
would have been a great deal more than 125,0001., as they wouldhave bad to provide also for the indigent blind, who at present came under the Poor Law. Dr. Addison added that he did n&apos;6t thinkthat - the grant, if given, would make&apos;local authorities unwilling to: take their share &apos; in, future provisions for this purpose. They were already assuming increased responsibility in various questions of: public health.The War Cabinet decided To approve the following recommendations of the Committee ofHome Affairs :--(to.) That grants should be made in accordance with thelines of Appendix (B) of the. memorandum ofthe President of the Local Government Board(Paper G.T.-7352).: (6.) That legislation should be introduced as early aspossible, in view of definite pledges given, butthe grants should not be delayed for this.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,June 13, 1919.
