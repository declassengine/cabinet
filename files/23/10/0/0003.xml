WITH reference to War Cabinet 553, Minute 1, the WarCabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the HomeSecretary (Paper G.T.-7083) asking for a ruling by the Cabinet as tothe manner in which the decision, that conscientious objectors whohave completed two years&apos;, imprisonment are to be released and discharged from the Army, was to be applied in the case ofconscientious objectors employed under the Committee on Employmentof Conscientious Objectors.Sir Edward Troup explained that the men were divided into two classes: (a) those Who, having served under the Committee fortwelve months or more, with good conduct and industry, had been permitted to take up &quot;exceptional employment.&quot; These men were,to all intents and purposes, already demobilised, and the Home Officecontrol over them was very loose indeed. Originally they had been engaged on work of national importance, but since&apos;the Armistice they
2had been employed on work of various kinds, and were widelyscattered over the country. There was practically no restrictionplaced upon them, although they were forbidden to engage in propaganda. If it was decided to release them, no public announce-ment would be necessary ; all that would be required was to notifythem that in future it would not be obligatory upon them to apply tothe Home Office for permission to change their employment.The Secretary for Scotland and the Deputy Adjutant-Generalhaving signified their concurrence in the Home Secretary&apos;s prqposal,the War Cabinet decided that -The men in the above class should be immediately discharged.Sir Edward Troup said that the men in class (b) were thosewho had not served twelve months under the Committee, or whoseconduct or industry had been bad. They numbered 678, and were employed in groups, chiefly at Dartmoor. Men of both the aboveclasses were, unlike the men in prison, men who had been alreadytransferred to Army Reserve &quot; W.&quot; In regard to class (b) men, theHome Office submitted two alternative courses : -(1.) That they should be released en Hoc;(2.) That they should be released as they complete an aggre-gate of two years&apos; service in prison and under theCommittee. to the latter course serious objections might be urged. The points in favour of the first course were : (i.) It would be much more simple, as a matter of adminis-tration, to discharge them en bloc than gradually ;(2.) It was reasonable that these men, who had agreed toaccept alternative service, should be more favourablytreated than men in prison;(3.) If only certain categories were released, the difficulty of retaining control over the remainder would be greatly-increased. The Committee&apos;s control depended upon theposver of calling individual men from the Reserve to theColours. If that power was not to be exercised therewould be nothing to prevent all the men on Dartmoorand elsewhere from going home;(4.) It would enable most of the staff of the conscientious objectors Department of the Home Office to be discharged at once, and would mean a saving of some800L to l,0O0Z. a week.&apos;The Deputy Adjutant-General explained that in so far as theArmy was concerned they had a somewhat similar problem, that is tosay, there were men awaiting trial, or having been tried awaitingcommittal to prison, who had completed on previous sentences many more than twenty-four months. The Secretary of State was verymuch opposed to their being discharged from their units because ofthe effect which might be produced. It had therefore been arranged to collect them at a selected detention barrack or barracks, to verifytheir documents, and eventually discharge them therefrom. In replyto a question, he said that if men working under the Home OfficeCommittee absconded they could be called up by the military autho-rities, and failure to rejoin would lead to their eventual arrest bythe police and their trial by court-martial for desertion. Anabsconder who returned to the Colours, however, would not be tried by the military authorities unless, and until, he disobeyed orders orcommitted some other offence. He suggested that there might be some difficulty in supporting, in Parliament and before the public,the trial, of such men and their subsequent committal to prison. Asregards the two alternati ve proposals of the Home Secretary, he was
. afraid of the effect on the army if these men were released en bloc.The army, as a whole, had no sympathy with the alternativist, and...... - would, he thought, resent their release en masse.   He thought the1 best thing would be to release at once the men who had done a totalof two jears in prison and under the Home Office Committee, and.     .       j  to release the remainder as they completed an aggregate of two years in prison and under the Home Office Committee.   In this connection,1 .&apos; .    &apos;::      he drew attention to the penultimate paragraph in the Home Secre-tary&apos;s memorandum, which stated that to release these men at onceen bloc would appear to give them an undue preference, but that course might not meet with so much opposition from the public pointof view as would a policy of recalling to the Colours and punishingmen who absconded from the Oommittee&apos;s control. .The Chancellor of the Exchequer enquired whether there were/   &quot;&apos; any men who were still undergoing sentence!   He asked this ques-tion as there appeared to be serious objection, from a military pointof view, to letting out men whose sentence was unexpired. he himself was in favour of the release en bloc, but he thought in that case the men would certainly not be entitled to draw unemploymentbenefit.The Secretary for Scotland said that, while there was much tobe urged in favour of their discharge en bloc, there was a, risk ofParliamentary difficulty if men who were still undergoing sentencewere released before they had served a sentence of two years.Sir Edward Troup said that there were probably about 100men, possibly more, but certainly not as many as 200, whose sen-tences were still une spired. These men were released from prisonon conditional pardon, the condition being that they should work under the Committee, and be of good behaviour. They could not be recalled to prison so long as they observed the condition, and thecondition could, of course, be waived.The War Cabinet decided that :-(a.) The men in class (b) should be released en bloc,and directed -The Home Secretary to take the necessary action in concert with the War Office.(b.) It was undesirable that men so discharged should receiveunemployment benefit.Merchant Shipping 2. The War Cabinet had before them a draft of the Merchant(Wireless ,     Shipping (Wireless Telegraphy) Bill (Paper G.T.-7084.)Telegraphy) Bill. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade said thatthe War Cabinet, on the 5th July, 1917 (War Cabinet 176,Minute 4), had under consideration a paper by the Admiraltyrelative to the fitting of wireless in merchant ships during the war,and the continuance of its use for overseas merchant ships of1,600 tons and over after the war. The War Cabinet had requested the Admiralty, the Board of Trade, and the Shipping Controller toconfer together, and, after deciding what was the best course toadopt, the Board of Trade should, if necessary, introduce a Bill togive effect to the decision. The present Bill was a result of consultations between the Departments concerned, and reallyprovided for continuing the practice which had been institutedduring the war under the Defence of the Realm Act, viz., that all vessels of 1,600 tons and over should be provided with wireless.The advantages of the Bill were: (1) general safety; (2) it wouldenable the Admiralty to take measures for the safety of all merchant ships immediately on the outbreak of war. Mr. Bridgeman addedthat the Act passed in 1914, which only laid down that ships carry-ing 50 or more persons should be fitted with wireless, had never been.
put into force, and the present Bill was in addition to that Act, and included cargo ships.The Postmaster-General expressed his approval of the Bill, and suggested that it would be a good thing if mates on cargo ships weremade to learn wireless telegraphy.Captain Nicholson stated that the Admiralty approved the Bill.The War Cabinet approved the Merchant Shipping (wireless telegraphy) Bill (Paper G.T.-7084).Joint Stock Banks. 3. The War Cabinet had under consideration the draft of a Billto make provision for controlling the amalgamation of Joint StockBanks, and for purposes connected therewith (Paper G.T.-7082), and decided To approve the introduction of the Bill.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W. 1,April 10, 1919.o
