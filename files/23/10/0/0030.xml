1. THE War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFood Controller (Paper G.T.-7360) relating to milk control, togetherwith Memoranda by the President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries (Paper G.T.-7343) and the President of the LocalGovernment Board (Paper G.T.-7478) on the same subject.The Food Controller said that during the war the Food ministry had exercised wide powers over milk by means of the Defence of the realm Act, and when it was contemplated that the Food ministry should disappear he considered it desirable to review what had beendone with regard to milk control and to make recommendations forthe future. It was obvious that the production and distribution of milk was in a very unsatisfactory state, and he therefore had to choose between a permanent and comprehensive system of Statecontrol and smaller devices which would ensure an improvement in distribution, production, and the cleanliness of milk. Fie had outlined in his memorandum a scheme by wdiich the State couldembark on the ownership of supplies, but these proposals hadreceived some adverse comment both from the President of theBoard of Agriculture and the President of the Local GovernmentBoard. He therefore did not anticipate that the War Cabinet wouldview his propositions regarding State control with much sympathy.The less ambitious proposals had, however, received general assent.They were as follows :  (a.) To license all dealers in milk. (This is already providedfor in the Scottish but not in the English Act.)(6.) To grade and define milk according to the-way it has been produced or treated. (This is partly covered by theexisting Act, but wider powers are needed.)(c.) To empower local authorities to undertake the supply of milk within their areas.(d.) To fix maximum prices in case of need.( e.) To regulate distribution in times of short supply.(/.) To control the use of milk for the manufacture of milk products.The President of the Board of Agriculture said he ,was ingeneral agreement with the lesser scheme proposed by the FoodController, although he had certain amendments and suggestions tooffer in regard to them.The President of the Local Government Board also agreed, and thought that the best means of carrying out the proposals of theFood Controller was to appoint a Committee, consisting of The Food Controller,The President of the Local Government Board,The President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries,The Secretary for Scotland,to frame a scheme for carrying out propositions (a) to (/). Hewould ask that, pending a scheme being formulated by thisCommittee, there would be no question of the Food Ministry giving up their control over milk.The Food Controller said that when he drafted his memorandumhe had contemplated the early death of the Ministry of Food. Itwas obvious now, however, that the Ministry of Food would have tocontinue longer than had been anticipated, and he agreed withdraw. Addison that it was desirable to retain the powers which theyexercised under the Defence of the Realm Act. ,The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would like toenter this caveat; the bigger milk control scheme suggested by theFood Controller would require an enormous Government staff&quot;, andhe hoped that the Committee, in considering the best means of
WC 582.      35putting the lesser proposals into effect, would avoid anything thatwould involve the employment of a large staff.The War Cabinet decided (1.) Not to adopt the scheme outlined in the Memorandum bythe Food Controller (Paper G.T.-7360) for the establish-ment of a Milk Control Board.(2.) To sanction the additional powers set out in paragraphs (a)to (/) at the conclusion of the Memorandum.(3.) To appoint a Committee consisting of representatives ofThe Ministry of Food,The Local Government Board,The Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, andThe Scottish Office.to agree upon the details of the proposals referred toin (2) to prepare the necessary Bill, and to frame ascheme for the necessary administration.Food Supplies. 2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he viewed withsome anxiety the future of our food supplies, and he had written tothe Shipping Controller regaiding the moving of food from cheapermarkets, where it could be more easily financed, and he hoped thatthe Food Controller would support his efforts in this direction.He was also somewhat exercised regarding the additional foodpurchases in the United States of America, especially as the conditionof the exchange in that country during the coming autumn would,he feared, be most unsatisfactory from our point of view. He there-fore urged that the Food Controller should obtain supplies from sources which were more favourable . to ourselves than the UnitedStates.Mr. Bonar Law asked whether the Shipping Controller could provide sufficient ships on the Australian and New Zealand service.He had seen Sir Joseph Ma clay with reference to his recentMemorandum (Paper G.T.-7469), and he believed that the ShippingController was now convinced that he would have to reimposerestrictions on shipping owing to the great shortage of tonnage.The Food Controller said that Sir Joseph Maclay had assuredhim that he could provide all the necessary ships for the australian and New Zealand service.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Acting Secretary should draw the attention of theShipping Controller to the above discussion.. (6.) In view of the probable shortage of food supplies duringthe coming winter, it would be necessary to  retain control of food longer than had been anticipated.Pensions arisingout of Disability orDeath due toformer Wars.[826]-7433. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum bythe Chairman of the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee (paper g.T.-7410) embodying certain decisions of.the Committee on thesubject of the pensions of Officers, Naval Warrant Officers, Nurses,and Men disabled, and the pensions of the wives and dependants ofOfficers and Naval Warrant Officers who died in consequence of former wars ; together with a note by the Acting Secretary to theWar Cabinet (Paper G.T.-7472) explaining that the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer desired War Cabinet authority &quot;before giving his assent to decision IV of the above Memorandum.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that decision IVrelated to the grant of a war bonus of 20 per cent, on pensionsgiven on account of death or disability arising out of former wars.He was continually being pressed to increase pensions in the case of 2
all old Government servants ; and he was very nervous lest, if he gaveway in respect of the particular pensions recommended by the Oom-mittee, he might in a few days be met with a demand for increases in all other Government pensions.The Minister of Pensions agreed that such a demand would inall probability be made by the Admiralty, who wished all their oldservice pensioners to be brought up to the current rates (paper g.T.-7473). . The present proposal, however, was for a war bonus ondisability pensions only.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had resisted thedemands of old Civil Servants to have their pensions increased, but had agreed that those retiring since the introduction of the warbonus should have the war bonus taken into consideration in assessingtheir pensions. He would be able to maintain this position if theWar Cabinet decided that increases in pensions should be made only in the ca.se of disability pensions. If, however, they wentfurther and gave an increase on service pensions, he would be unableto resist the demand for increases to all Government pensioners.The President of the Board of Trade, speakiug as Chairman ofthe Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee, said that he did not think the Chancellors position would be weakened by the grant of thewar bonus proposed by the Committee, since that was strictlyconfined to disability and death pensions. There was a distinctcleavage between the latter and the purely service pensions, in whichthe Admiralty were pressing for increases. -Mr. Bonar Law agreed that, since that was so, the Chancellorsposition would not be affected by the proposed war bonus. Asregards the Admiralty proposals, that all old service pensions shouldbe raised to current rates, this had already been considered and rejected by the War Cabinet when the Jerram Committee rates were under discussion (War Cabinet 565, Minute 2). The position was bound to be a difficult one for the Treasury, in face of the continuous demands made upon them, but be thought the present proposal could be agreed to, apart altogether from the question of increases in service pensions.The War Cabinet decided To approve the decisions of the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; pay committee, set out in the Memorandum by the Chairmanof the Committee (Paper G.T.-7410), on the distinctunderstanding that the war bonus under IV should begranted only in the case of pensions given on account ofdisability or death arising out of former wars, and shouldnot be regarded as a ground for extension to other types of Government pension.The Bread Subsidy. 4. The War Cabinet had under consideration a note by theFood Controller (Paper G.T.-7500) enclosing two memoranda from. the Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies, and recommending(i) that the scheme for the decontrol of the flour mills, outlined inthe first memorandum, be adopted; and (ii) that the proposal in thesecond memorandum, for the withdrawal of the Precluded PurposesClause of the Flour and Bread (Prices) Order, 1917, be also acceptedby the Cabinet. In his note Mr. Roberts stated that the most convenient time for the determination of control was the end of thepresent year, and, as the millers were entitled to six months&apos; notice,it was important that a decision should be reached without delay. .&apos;Lord. Crawford, speaking as Chairman of the Royal Commissionon Wheat Supplies, explained that it was thought impracticable atthe time when the bread subsidy was introduced to confine thebenefit of the subsidy to flour used by bakers and householders forbread baking, and it had been accord ingly decided by the Cabinetthat the subsidjr should be extended to ail flour used by bakers and
5WC 582.confectioners, and also to all flour sold for domestic consumption,but that a license duty should be charged on flour for wholesalebiscuit making and other &quot;precluded purposes.&quot; Early this year theFood Controller had appointed a Committee to see to what extent itmight be possible now to limit the bread subsidy to bread flour.The Committee reported in due course (i) that the present system was now open to serious objection, as (a) out of the total subsidy,estimated at 50,000,0007,. per annum, some 14,500,000Z. was due tothe use of subsidised flour for purposes other than the manufactureof bread; (6) that the licence duty on flour for precluded purposesentailed serious hardships on certain manufacturers, its collection was difficult, and, in the absence of an Act of Parliament, the duty unpaidcould not be recovered ; (ii) that the present system could be improved by the abolition of the licence duty, except in the case of export,ships&apos; stores and industrial uses ; and (iii) that, as an alternative tothe present system, it was now administratively practicable to confine the subsidy to flour used in the manufacture of loaf bread. TheCommittee reported, however, that the latter plan though adminis-tratively practicable was open to fatal political objections. At an interview on the 12th June, at the Treasury, the Chancellor had said that he was not prepared to suspend the licence duties, as itwould involve the Government in a possible loss. The wheat commission thought that, in order to secure the saving of14,500,000Z. to the Treasury, a most elaborate system of registrationwould be inevitable. The Treasury would naturally be reluctant to lose so large a sum ; but, on the other hand, the gigantic operationof flour rationing was bound to produce grave political trouble.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that Mr. McCurdy, theChairman of the Departmental Committee appointed by Mr. Robertsto investigate the incidence of the administration of the bread subsidy, had come to see him about the question now before theCabinet. It appeared that the licence duty on flour used for other purposes than making bread worked very unfairly. It had willinglybeen accepted during the War, but could hardly be retained to-day.In practice the licence sometimes worked out at a higher figure than thesubsidy, which really amounted to taxing exports. In Mr. McCurdy&apos;view, the licence duty must go, and if the Cabinet decided to continuethe bread subsidy it should be extended to flour used for all edible.purposes. Mr. McCurcly had worked out a scheme by which thesubsidy would be confined to bread flour, but it raised such political* difficulties that, although it was practicable, it was not, in his view,expedient to adopt it. The present scheme would cost 14,500,0001.in respect of . flour other than that used for bread, and he(Mr. Chamberlain) strongly deprecated the Government spendingthat amount on subsidising fancy articles of food while at the sametime it taxed exports.&apos; It was most important to stop all unneces-sary waste, and he thought that the bread subsidy should be confined to its proper purpose. Political difficulties would arise nodoubt, especially in parts of the country where home baking Was thecustom, but he thought that the War Cabinet should face these difficulties.Lord Crawford pointed out that, for every sack used by theconfectioner four sacks were used by bond fide householders.- Theprice of flour sold retail, all of which was at present subsidised,would have to be raised from 2s. 8d. per stone to the full cost priceof 3s. 10cZ., in order to cover the cost of production to the Government.In reply to a question by Mr. Bonar Law, he stated that the view ofhis Commission was that the price of wheat would fall rapidlyduring the next six months, unless the United States were in aposition to maintain control of the prices. There was enough wheat in the Plate, and in Australia, at a price almost to eliminate thesubsidy if only tonnage could be found to lift it. Our presentsubsidy cost 47,500,000Z, a year, and would continue to do so so long-as we were dependent upon the United States for wheat.
Sir William Beveridge thought that political trouble was boundto ensue if the subsidy were limited to bread flour, as, apart fromdifficulties of registration, it would mean the raising of the price of flour for other domestic purposes for all households. It wouldinvolve all the machinery of bread rationing. As to the licenceduty, the conditions had wholly changed since the decision of theCabinet in August 1917. At that time the wholesale manufacturerwas making biscuits for the Army, and there was not enough fat inthe country to admit of the manufacture of pastry. In presentcircumstances the ordinary confectioner was being subsidised totbe prejudice of the big biscuit manufacturer with whom he nowcompeted.Mr. Bonar Law said that he was very anxious, if possible, toget rid of tbe subsidy altogether. As regards the prospect ofpolitical trouble, it was more possible to continue an injustice towhich people were accustomed than to introduce a new restriction,even though it were more just than that already in force.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that Mr. McCurdy had informed him that the injustice of the present system of licensing was so glaring that it could not be left where it was. To-day, as hadbeen suggested, we were subsidising the confectioner and penalisingthe biscuit manufacturer. He wondered whether, without abolishing the licence system and without confining the subsidy to bread alone,it would not be possible to revise the licences so as to remove thepresent anomalies. It would not save any money for the Treasury,but it would remove a trade grievance-Mr. Paul said that he did not think that the large biscuitmanufacturers were much concerned with the competition of theordinary confectioner. As regards the licence duty, he saw nodifficulty in adjusting it to the correct figure.The Food Controller said that he hoped the War Cabinet would accept his scheme for the decontrol of the flour mills, as this would,among other things, start competition afresh.The President of the Board of Agriculture said &quot;that he had noobjection to this proposal.The War Cabinet decided -(a.) To leave the bread subsidy as it stands at present; -(o.) To adjust the licence duty to the present rate of subsidy ;(c.) To accept the Wheat Commission^ scheme for the decontrolof the flour mills.5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by SirL. Worthington Evans on Future Agricultural Policy (paper g.T.-7413), and took note of the same.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,June 20, 1919.
