The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Minister of Labour (Paper G.T.-7049) on the subject of the twelve-hours&apos; clause of the Bread Order, and night-baking.The Minister of Labour explained that, the twelve-hours&apos;clause of the Bread Order had been introduced during the war inorder to promote economy in cereal consumption, as people ate lessstale than fresh bread. As a consequence of the Order baking at night had ceased. The reasons for the restriction on consumptionhad now disappeared, and the Food Controller desired to revoke theOrder. On the other hand, the operative bakers throughout the kingdom threatened to strike unless night-baking was abolished.The Ministry of Labour had explored the various courses open tothem to secure a settlement, but up to the present without success,and there appeared to remain three alternatives : (i.) To maintain the existing Order prohibiting the sale of newbread.(ii.) For the Ministry of Food to be prepared, in the event of astrike  becoming imminent, to  exercise their  powersB
under Section 2 (GG) of the Defence of the realm regulations and to give directions prohibiting night-work in bakehouses, subject to any necessaryexceptions.(iii.) To stand aside and let events take their course.Sir Robert Home explained that he favoured the second alternative. The Food Controller, however, thought that theresponsibility for prohibiting night-baking should rest with theMinistry of Labour and the Home Office. He was perfectlyprepared to undertake the responsibility, since he thought a strike of bakers at present would be most regrettable.The Food Controller said he doubted whether he had the powerto issue an Order prohibiting night-baking- on the ground nowadvanced. The twelve-hours&apos; clause had been put into force in theinterests of food economy. Before he knew that the question of night work was likely to lead to trouble, he had told deputations ofmaster bakers and others that this Order would be revoked as soonas the cereal position permitted. He doubted whether it would bepolitic for the Ministry of Food to exercise its powers in what was a trade dispute. There was no doubt that the employers wouldaccuse the War Cabinet of taking sides before full enquiry hadbeen made into both aspects of the question. He thought theHome Secretary should enquire into the whole question of nightwork before any decision was taken. His own advisers were of theopinion that a stiike in any case was unlikely. Another point forthe Cabinet to consider was that during the past few days certainmaster bakers had announced that, as soon as the twelve-hours&apos;clause was revoked, they would be able to reduce the price of theloaf from 9d. to 8^d., and this fact would doubtless have a big effecton public opinion. His advisers suggested that the clause should be suspended, and at the same time a statement issued to the effectthat the Ministry of Food retained power to reimpose it shouldtrouble ensue. Finally, he would like to point out that the Ministryof Food was to be closed down as soon as possible, and the retentionof a particular Order of this kind would mean that the section of his staff which dealt with such Orders would be kept longer than wasnecessarv.The Minister of Reconstruction enquired if there were anybaking factories which, for purposes of economy, it was necessary tokeep running throughout the twenty-four hours.Mr. Paul said that many of these factories existed in London in fact, London could only be fed by retaining night work.Lord Curzon said the Food Controller had made three points which were not mentioned in Sir Robert Horne&apos;s Memorandum :first, he had suggested that the question should be left open pending further enquiry ; secondly, he had expressed doubt as to whether astrike would in any case occur; thirdly, a suggestion had been made that the clause should be suspended, to see what effect it would haveupon the policy of the operative bakers. He would like to know what the Minister of Labour had to say with regard to these threematters.The Minister of Labour said that, as regards a strike, he was advised that it would certainly take place if night work were resumed. The Food Controller wished to revoke the twelve-hours&apos;clause at once, and as soon as this was done the master bakers would start night-baking again, and this would probably lead to animmediate strike. His own suggestion was that work should be suspended from 11 p.M. to 5 A.M., and he saw no reason why bakerscould not carry on with those restricted hours. He was entirely in sympathy with the attitude of the operatives, who wished to abolishall-night work. He was, however, agreeable that the matter shouldbe reconsidered and made the subject of a full enquiry, but it wouldhave-to be done quickly.
Unemployment 2. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum byBenefit. the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Paper G.T.-7071) on unemploy-ment benefit, in which was included a letter from Sir RobertKindersley, chairman of the National War Savings Committee.In his memorandum the Chancellor of the Exchequer stated thatit was imperative that steps should be taken to reform the existingagencies distributing unemployment benefit. The Labour Exchangeswere overworked and incapable of exercising proper control, andthere was overlapping between the. allocation of pensions and unemployment benefit. He suggested that a committee should beappointed by the Cabinet to examine the present administration ofunemployment benefit, and to report what steps should be taken toprevent abuse.Mr. Chamberlain said that, while Sir Robert Home held very strongly that the Government were right in granting unemploy-ment benefit and extending the period for which it waspayable at a reduced rate, he admitted that there was a good dealof abuse. The Minister of Pensions took, he believed, the same view. There was no doubt that the proper co-ordination of pensionsand unemplojunent benefit depended upon the efficiency of theLabour Exchanges and of the Local Pensions Committees. Whereone or other of these bodies in any given locality was not efficient,abuses would arise. Cases bad occurred in which a man whowas receiving a pension for total disablement was also receiving umemployment benefit at the same time. There was very strong-feeling in the House of Commons that unemployment benefitwas giving rise to grave abuses, and was encouraging men who might find work at reasonable rates of pay to withhold their labour. Sir E-obert Kindersley had expressed the view, both in hislatter and at a subsequent interview, that small investors were?. 8eii*in$ o contribute towards the purchase of saving certificates on[826]-481 B 2Sir Edward Troup said that the Home Office held the same-views with regard to this matter as the Ministry of Labour. they thought it was very desirable that night work should be abolishedwherever possible, and it would be very unfortunate if a strikecame about in consequence of the twelve-hours&apos; clause being allowedto lapse.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he thought that manyadvantages would ensue from an enquiry into the conditions of thetrade in London, and suggested that it might be possible to appoint a body, on the same lines as the Coal Commission, to go into thequestion. The Order could be suspended and the announcement ofa Committ e of Enquiry could be made simultaneously.The 1 ood Controller informed the War Cabinet that he had consulted the Consumers&apos; Council, on which body Labour was very fully represented, on this matter, and they had quite realised thedifficulties of retaining the Order.The Minister of Labour said that he was quite prepared to sound the men and find out what would be their attitude to an offer by theGovernment of an enquiry into the whole question. Sir robert home added that he had just received further- information to theeffect that opinion was moving rapidly in the direction of &amp; strike,and that the bakers intended it to be a national strike should it bedecided to reimpose night work.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Minister of Labour, in consultation with the HomeSecretary, should ascertain the attitude of the mastersand men to a Government enquiry into night work inthe baking trade in London ;(b.) Pending a decision as to the proposed enquiry, the twelve-hours&apos; clause of the Bread Order should be retained..
the ground that their money was being wastefully distributed in umemployment benefit, and was being made use of to pay their neighbours for doing nothing. This feeling was prevalent bothamongst employers and amongst the working-classes themselves.Accepting the contention that the unemployment donation must continue, he felt that the Government would be greatly to blameunless they could show that they were doing all that was possibleto prevent abuses in administration. The committee, if appointed,should undertake a detailed investigation of typical cases, and determine exactly what was happening. The Committee should be assisted by the evidence of efficient inspectors appointed by theMinistry of Labour and the Ministry of Pensions.Lord Curzon was of opinion that it was most important to setup a Committee at once. The unemployment donation had been mentioned by every speaker in a recent debate in the House ofLords. The question was regarded there as amounting almost to ascandal. There was also a very prevalent feeling of distrust of theadministration of the Labour Exchanges.The Minister of Labour said that, while it was true that theunemployment benefit had been the subject of great abuse, therewas, on the other hand, very genuine unemployment in certain partsof the country, particularly in Lancashire, among people who weretotally unable to get employment anywhere. If unemploymentbenefit were entirely cut off or reduced too low there would be aconvulsion throughout the State. The administration of unemploy-ment benefit was a very serious problem, and the existing machinery required close investigation. One of the great difficulties arose fromthe fact that, owing to the general prejudice against the EmploymentExchanges, employers refused to notify the Exchanges of vacancies,with the result that it was impossible for the Exchanges to bringvacancies to the notice of persons applying for the unemployment donation.Sir L. Worthington Evans suggested that the enquiry shouldbe of such a uature that the Government might base upon theReport of the Committee decisions of principle to guide their future policy, such as, for example, that pensions should be taken intoaccount in assessing unemployment benefit.Sir Auckland Geddes stated that&apos;there were two matters forconsideration. In the first place, it was necessary to obtain a seriesof decisions on which the Government policy for the future was tobe based. The second consideration was one of internal administra-tion. It was necessary to see that there was co-ordination of the.machinery of the Ministry of Pensions and the Labour Exchanges,and to ensure that the Labour Exchanges were doing their workproperly.The Minister of Labour said that, in regard to the principles ofpolicy, the difficulty was that the Industrial Conference was alreadydealing with schemes for mitigating unemployment, and if aCommittee were set up to investigate the same problem it would seriously weaken the position of the Industrial Conference, whichwould be very unfortunate, having regard to the progress which theConference was making to secure industrial peace. On the otherhand, he agreed that a Committee should be set up to scrutinisethe administration of the present unemployment donation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he understood the *Industrial Conference was taking up the question of unemploymentinsurance, contributory or non-contributory, as a general problem ofthe future, and he hoped that a reasonable scheme would beproduced. What was at present wanted, however, was an enquiry into the disbursements that were now being made, his belief being that a great deal of the money was being wasted and given to people who were not entitled to it. The question was quite apart from theproblem of the future of unemployment. Sucii a committee could beappointed by the Minister of Labour as one of his departmental
functions, but it should be composed partly of independent people-whose opinions would carry weight.The Minister of Labour agreed, and said that it would he ofassistance to him in Parliament to be able to say that he had alreadyappointed a Committee to enquire into the administration of theunemployment donation.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) A Committee should be appointed to consider and report upon the administration of unemployment benefit;(b.) The Minister of Labour should consider who would bei suitable as members of the Committee, and should reportthe proposed composition of the Committee to the WarCabinet in a few days&apos; time.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,April 8, 1919.
