The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidjectors. that ^he question of the treatment of Conscientious Objectors wasto be raised in the House of Lords that afternoon, and he wishedto have the instructions of the War Cabinet as to the line he shouldtake. When the matter had last been before the Cabinet (WarCabinet 545, Minute 1), the Secretary of State for War, backed by all his Military Experts, had pronounced strongly in favour ofthe release from prison of Conscientious Objectors. The decisionof the Cabinet on that occasion had been that the question shouldbe deferred for a further period of two weeks. The HomeSecretary had shared Mr. ChurchiU&apos;s view, though after carefulconsideration he had been unable to recommend any further[826]-458 B
mitigation of the conditions of imprisonment in the case of menwho had carried out sentences of two years or more. The actualnumber of Objectors concerned was about 700. The reasons urgedagainst their release were: (a.) A large proportion of them were thoroughly badcharacters;(5.) Thati if they were released they would prejudice the chances of employment of men who were graduallybeing demobilised.He did not think, however, that either argument could be seriouslypursued. The men were much too few to affect employment, andthose who were blackguards would remain so whether they weredetained or not for a few weeks longer in prison. It was certainthat these men must be released soon, and he saw no valid reasonfor their further detention.The Secretary of State for War referred to a mischievousparagraph which had appeared in the &quot; Westminster Gazette &quot;on the previous evening, to the effect that the Home Secretary andhe himself had pressed for the release of Conscientious Objectors,but that the military officials in the War Office had got at theCabinet behind their backs. This accusation was most unjustand absolutely false, and he was taking steps to have it refutedin Parliament. The facts, of course, had been that the cabinet had decided that the men should be detained, against the views ofthe military experts. The Military Members of the Army council were unanimous that the Army, as a whole, would accept withoutdemur the release of these men, within the limits stated in his memorandum (Paper G.T.-6873).Mr. Bonar Law said that the decision of the War Cabinet a fortnight previously had really been due to an answer he had givento a question in the House of Commons, on the 26th February,1919, when he had stated that the Government were not preparedto release these Objectors until demobilisation was furtheradvanced. He suggested that the Leader of the House of Lordsmight reply to the effect that the release would take place as soonas demobilisation was complete, except for the numbers requiredfor the Standing Army, which would probably not mean a delay ofmore than another week or two. He did not wish to press thepoint, but for various reasons he thought it desirable that thequestion down to be asked in the House of Lords that afternoonshould, if possible, be deferred for another week.The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Becon-struction said they concurred in the view expressed by lord curzon, that it was desirable that the men should be released withthe least possible delay.The War Cabinet decided that .(a.) The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, inthe House of Lords, and the Secretary of State forWar, in the House of Commons, should make siniul-taneous announcements, stating that the Government,on the advice of military officials of the War Office,had decided to release all Conscientious Objectors,within the limits laid down by Mr. Churchill in his memorandum;(b.) It was desirable that these announcements should notbe made for another week.With reference to (&amp;) above, the Secretary of State for Warundertook to see Lord Parmoor that morning, in order to inducehim, if possible, to defer asking this question until the following week. If Lord Parmoor would not agree to do this the announce-ment should be made in both Houses that afternoon.
Submission of Esti- 2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by themates to Parlia- Chancellor of the Exchequer (Paper G.T.-7O20), and decidedment- that-(a.) No Estimates are to be presented to Parliament without previous submission to and approval by the Treasury.(&amp;.) Large questions of policy in connection with the Naval,Air and Civil Services are to be submitted for cabinet decision or approval.Censorship ^ne Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War, on the maintenance of the censorship(Paper G.T.-7050), stating that the War Cabinet had decided,on the 12th February, 1919 (War Cabinet 531, Minute 6), thatthe censorship should be maintained; that on the 28th of the same&apos; month Mr. Balfour had agreed with the American representatives on the Inter-Allied Blockade Committee, in Paris, to abolish all british censorship of American transit messages, and that that agreement was put into force from the 12th March, 1919, although this was inconsistent with the above War Cabinet decision; thatthe American representatives in Paris had proposed to theSupreme Blockade Council that all British censorship of transit,postal or cable communication should cease, and that censorshipshould only be carried out by the Allied countries of origin ordestination, or, in the case of neutral countries, by the first Alliedcountry through which the messages passed. The Memorandumfurther pointed out that the sole object of these proposals was the&apos; avoidance of British censorship, and their acceptance would operate exclusively against British interests, and the view of theWar Office was that there were but two alternatives: to maintainthe censorship as it is, or to abolish it altogether; if it wasdecided to maintain it, the American or similar proposals shouldbe strongly opposed.The Secretary of State for War said that the concessionsgranted to the American representatives must have the most fortunate effect, and he proceeded to give varioxis strongmilitary reasons for retaining the censorship. He pointed outthat the French authorities still maintained the strictest possiblecensorship, and had never for a moment relaxed their firm gripof the French press. It was not possible to undo now what hadbeen done, but his Department was strongly opposed to any further relaxation.The Posmaster-General pointed out the grave hindrancethat the censorship caused to business. The commercial worldperhaps unduly blamed the censorship, but there was no doubtthat its removal would tend to make business once more flowfreely. He himself was inclined to think that, by maintaining it,we were doing ourselves more harm than the enemy. Considerablerelief might be given by the revival of private codes, which it was calculated would relieve the cables of 20 per cent, of their work.Mr. Bonar Law said that the question was whether, in thelong run, the maintenance of the censorship did us more harm than good, and he did not think that the War Cabinet were in aposition to come to a decision on the subject that morning.The War Cabinet decided that A Committee, under the Chairmanship of the Home Secretary,should be formed of representatives of the Departmentsconcerned, viz.: The War Office,The Admiralty,i The Foreign Office,The Post Office,The Board of Trade,[826]-458 B 2
The Ministry of Reconstruction,The Irish Office,to go into the whole question and to decide whether to abolish the censorship or to continue it.&quot;unemployment and 4. (a.) The War   Cabinet  took   note  of  the   following the state of trade.   Minutes of Conferences on the question of Unemployment and theState of Trade: Minutes of a Conference held at 10, Downing Street, on the25th February, 1919 (Paper G.T.-6887),G.T.-6835, G.T.-6843, G.T.-6923, G.T.-6924, and G.T.-6925,being Minutes of Conferences held at 2, Whitehall Gardens, underthe Chairmanship of the Minister of Reconstruction.(&amp;.) The War Cabinet had before them a Report by theMinister of Reconstruction (Paper G.-237) on an Enquiry intothe question of rehabilitating trade and providing employment,which he had undertaken at the request of the Prime Minister.The Minister of Reconstruction said that, in his Report, hehad made a certain number of very important recommendations,for which the approval of the Cabinet would be required in due course. He wished, however, that morning to draw special atten-tion to a matter of particular urgency, and that was the questionof Government machinery for dealing with trade and commerce(Section IV of the Report, paragraphs 24 to 27). His recom-mendations under this heading included: (a.) That the Board of Trade should absorb not only the war trade Department, but also the Overseas trade department, and the War Trade Intelligence Depart-ment, and that it should take over from the Ministryof Supply and from Departments such as the WarOffice, which have functions to hand over to theMinistry of Supply, the control of raw materials thatare held on Government account but which are requiredby our manufacturers and traders to re-establish theirbusinesses;(b.) That some joint machinery, possibly of the nature of a standing   Inter-Departmental   Committee   of   theForeign Office and the Board of Trade, should be estab-lished to control such services as the Consular Service,&apos; Commercial Attaches, &amp;c.He suggested that a Committee, consisting of one nominee ofthe Foreign Office, one nominee of the Board of Trade, and a third member, who should belong to neither Department, shouldbe appointed to advise as to what machinery it might be desirableto set up.Mr. Bonar Law said that it was desirable that the WarCabinet should come to a decision on this very important questionwithout delay. He himself was inclined to think that the Ministerof Reconstruction was right in his view, but he felt that the whole matter must be most carefully investigated before any decision were taken. It was very necessary that the Committee, if set up.,should be composed of men who would carry weight.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that the actualmembers of the Committee should not be heads or officials of departments. He would prefer to have the Committee constitutedof three entirely independent men, who would, of course, summonto their meetings officials of the Departments concerned.If was agreed that  it was desirable that Sir Auckland Geddes&apos;recommendations should be closely examined by a Committee, not
Report of the Com-mittee of theNational Indus-trial Conference.5. The War Cabinet had before them the Report of the Com-mittee of the National Industrial Conference, together with covering Memoranda by the Minister of Labour (Papers G.T.-7057and 7057a).The Minister of Labour said that the Industrial Conferencemet over a month ago and elected a Committee, composed equallyof employers and employees, to report on certain important issues.The Committee had now presented a unanimous Report, and thefollowing were some of the recommendations which they suggested should be made law: (a.) A maximum number of working hours for all trades a48-hour week is recommended.(6.) The establishment by law of a minimum wage for alloccupations, the amount to be fixed by a commission which is to investigate and report.(c.) The continuance until the 21st November, 1919, of theWages (Interim Regulation) Act, which stabiliseswages at the level at which they stood at the signing of the Armistice;(d.) The setting up of a National Industrial Council,composed equally of employers and employed, and a standing Committee! of such a Council, for the purposeof investigating and dealing with Labour conditions,this Committee to meet monthly and to advise theGovernment.The Minister of Labour said that Sir Thomas Munro had written saying that the Committee hoped the Government would announce its adherence to the policy outlined in the Report whenthe Industrial Conference met on the following day. Sir robert home stated that he had just learned that Mr. Arthur Hendersonhad been to Paris and had seen the Prime Minister and Mr,Barnes. Mr. Henderson had said that the Prime Minister receivedthe Report most favourably, and endorsed every word of it; also,that the Prime Minister was going to write to the War Cabinetgiving them his views. This letter, however, had not been received.It was probable that Mr. Henderson would state at to-morrow&apos;conference that the Prime Minister accepted the Report. In his(Sir Robert Horne&apos;s) opinion it would, on balance, be undesirable to commit the Government to-morrow to a full acceptance of theCommittee&apos;s recommendations, and he suggested that he shouldbe authorised to take a line somewhat as follows. He would pointout that the Report was a Committee&apos;s Report, and that theGovernment did not know whether, and to what extent, it wouldbe endorsed by the Conference as a. whole. The Conference hadbeen called together by the Government, and the members wouldprobably wish to consult their organisations before committingthem to the programme of the Committee.  If, after consultation,composed- of men belonging  to  Government Departments, butacquainted with the machinery of those Departments, and that lord Cave should be asked to undertake the duties of Chairman.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To establish a Committee at once, to examine thequestion of Government machinery for dealing with trade and commerce;(&amp;.) That the Leader of the House of Lords should take anearly opportunity of ascertaining Lord Cave&apos;s willing-ness, or otherwise, to be Chairman of the Committee;(c.) That the Minister of Reconstruction and the ActingSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs should consult together and make recommendations to the Cabinet asto the further composition of the Committee.
2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,April 3, 1919.oit is found that the Committee&apos;s recommendations are generallyacpeptable, he would lay them before the Cabinet for their early and, he felt sure, their sympathetic consideration. In the mean-time, the Government were prepared to give effect to the stabilisingof wages for a further six months, and to the setting up of aNational Industrial Conference and Standing Committee thesebeing a natural development of the Whitley Council. TheMinister of Labour added that he was definitely of the view thatGovernment action with reference to minimum wages and maximum hours could not be long delayed.Mr. Bonar Law said that he feared it might create a badimpression in the country if the Government was rushed intoaccepting a Report of this kind, with far-reaching consequences,without due consideration. He would favour, however, giving aguarantee as to the stabilisation of wages. With regard to theremainder of the Report, he agreed with the course suggested bythe Minister of Labour. In the absence of the Prime Minister itwas obviously difficult to take a final decision on these important issues.Lord Curzon agreed with Mr. Bonar Law, and thought thatwhen the views of the different Departments on the Report hadbeen received, a full discussion should take place.The Minister of Labour said that on the previous day he had seen a leading employer, who had arrived at the conclusion thatthe country had been so near the precipice within the last fewweeks that the only way to convince Labour that the Governmentwas sympathetic was to accept the Report and introduce thenecessary legislation as soon as possible.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, supposing it was right to accept the Report, to do so at 24 hours&apos; notice wouldhave a very damaging effect, and, when the necessary legislation was being introduced, the fact that the Government had acceptedthe Report at such short notice, and without careful digestion,would tell against them in the House of Commons.The War Cabinet decided that Provided no communication in an opposite sense was receivedfrom the Prime Minister regarding his views on theReport, the Minister of Labour should inform the Indus-trial Conference on the following day that the Govern-ment viewed with favour the Committee&apos;s recommenda-tions with regard to the stabilisation of wages by a continuance of the Wages (Temporary Regulations)Act, 1918, till November 21st, 1919, and the setting upof a National Industrial Council, and were prepared tocarry out the recommendations to that effect in theReport; but that while they would take the other partsof the Report into their sympathetic consideration, theycould not give any immediate assurance with regard tothem.
