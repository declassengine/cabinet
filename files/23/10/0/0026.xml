The Bolshevists had beenboasting of having sunk one of our submarines by gunfire, and aswe had received no news of her for six days it must be assumed that she was lost. This was the first naval casualty we hadsustained at the hands of the Bolshevists.The Secretary of State for War said that this loss would attract public attention, and that questions would certainly be askedin Parliament, certain members of which would want to know what our Navy was doing in those waters.Lord Curzon said that the explanation would be that our shipsm the Baltic were protecting the movements of our Allies in north russia.British Officers and 2. With reference to War Cabinet 567, Minute 3, the SecretaryRussian Brigade. of State for War said that he wished to refer to a memorandum-randum by himself which he had recently circulated to the WarCabinet, entitled &quot; The Expansion of General Knox&apos;s mission in Siberia&quot; (Paper G.T.-7415). The idea was to form a Slavo-British unit with British officers and non-commissioned officers,[826]-7-12
and the proposal had been approved on the 14th May by himself asa Departmental matter. On the same day the Chancellor of theExchequer had drawn the attention of the War Cabinet to a telegramfrom Mr. Hodgson, in which the latter referred to the proposal, andMr. Chamberlain had pointed out that this step committedus to a more definite support of Koltchak&apos;s Government than we had hitherto afforded. Lord Curzon had agreed that this was closely related to the question of recognition of Koltchak, and also theCabinet had decided to refer the proposal to the Foreign Office, theWar Office, and the British representatives in Paris; and that,pending receipt, of the latter&apos;s views, sanction should not be given.Plis own opinion, in which Mr. Balfour, with whom he had discussed the matter in Paris, had concurred, was that details of how theincreased personnel of the Mission should be employed was a purelyDepartmental matter. i m the 23rd May, General Knox had telegraphed making further proposals on the same lines, andMr. Churchill said that he had approved this and had givendirections that steps should be taken to give effect.. When talkingover the matter with Mr. Balfour he had demurred at having torefer the matter again to the Cabinet, as no new principle was created, and the question was quite within his own scope and wasalso in accordance with bis policy. Mr. Balfour had agreed that, inthe circumstances, further reference to the War Cabinet seemedunnecessary. In reply to a question, Mr. Churchill said that he had had no opportunity of discussing the matter with the Prime Ministerbut only with Mr. Balfour.The War Cabinet took note of the statement of the Secretaryof State for War.Decentralisation of 3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thethe Ministry of Minister of Pensions (Paper G.T.-7389), relative to a difficulty whichPensions. jias arisen between the Pensions Department and the Board ofEducation, as to the temporary occupation of school premises atAlbany Street, Cardiff ; and a Note on the above proposal by thePxesident of the Board of Education (Paper G.T.-7421). In his memorandum the Minister of Pensions stated that the War cabinet had approved the decentralisation of certain functions of his Ministry,and that under the scheme a Wales Region had been inauguratedwith headquarters at Cardiff. The Office of Works had proposed the Albany Street Schools, about to be vacated by the Army Medicalauthorities, as suitable temporary accommodation for the MinistryRegional headquarters staff, pending the acquisition of permanentbuildings. An impasse had, however, been created by the refusal ofthe President of the Board of Education to sanction the occupationof the schools by the Pension Ministry staff. The President of theBoard of Education in his Note of the 5th June stated his reasonsfor not being able to acquiesce in the proposal. Public feeling against the occupation of schools and other buildings by Governmentstaffs was very keen. The record of Cardiff, moreover, as regardsschool accommodation was bad. Mr. Fisher suomitted that this wasnot the time to retain, for non-educational purposes, school buildingswith accommodation for 1,577 children, especially in a town wherethe local authorities had been lax in providing school accommodation.The War Cabinet decided To refer the matter to Lord Milner for decision.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.,June 11,1919.
