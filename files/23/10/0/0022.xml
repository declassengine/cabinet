The War Cabinet had under consideration a scheme for the consular Service. reform and development of the Consular and CommercialDiplomatic Services, which had been drawn up by the Directorof Overseas Trade (Paper G.-243), with a covering note byLord Curzon, expressing the hope that the War Cabinet would take an early decision upon whether the recommendations contained inthe scheme should be approved and taken into effect; and aMemorandum by the Minister of Labour (Paper G.T.-7318).The Director of Overseas Trade said that what wasreqiured was the approval of the War Cabinet of the general principles laid down in Part &quot; A &quot; of the scheme, and of Part &quot; B &quot;with the exception of that portion which related to the TradeCommissioners, as any decision in regard to these must depend upon the findings of Lord Cave&apos;s Committee. It was abundantlyevident that some new procedure was necessary, whicheverDepartment should be called upon to administer it. The ConsularService to-day was in a very bad way, being both under-paid and[826]-689 B
grossly under-staffed. Some improvement in pay was essential, butin drawing up bis scheme he had had due regard to economy. Thequestion of the various posts and the training that should beundergone by Commercial Councillors, Trade Commissioners, &amp;c,had been gone iuto with the greatest care. Part &quot; A &quot; covered thewhole of the questions affecting the salaried Consular Service, andthere was an urgent need that this portion, at any rate, of hisscheme should be adopted without delay.The President of the Board of Trade said that, so far asPart &quot; A &quot; was concerned, he had no point to raise. That portionof Part &quot; B,&quot; however, which referred to Trades Commissionerswas acutely controversial and. as had been stated by Sir ArthurSteel-Maitland, could not be settled until the Cabinet were inpossession of the Report of Lord Cave&apos;s Committee. He wished the whole of Part &quot; B &quot; reserved for farther consideration.The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention to the addi-tional expenditure involved, which his Department viewed withconcern. The total annual increase amounted, he understood, to1,233,0007., including War Bonus and Exchange compensation. Thenormal expenditure before the war amounted to 436.000Z.; to-day it stood at 742,000Z. ; under the Tilley Scheme it was estimated to reach789,000Z. ; and under the present scheme it would be l,O50,000Z.Mr. Bonar Law pointed out that the difference was 550,000Z.if increases due to war provision were omitted, or, say, 050,000Z.with War Bonus.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, proceeding, said that thescheme apparently was to bring the Consular Service on to a levelwith the Diplomatic Service. He did not understand why two new schemes should have been produced in such rapid succession.There were many points in the scheme which required elucidation.It did not, for instance, inspire confidence when, under the TilleyScheme, Entertainment Allowance was computed at 5,000Z.,whereas Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland put it at 84,O0OZ. Further, he must take objection to the proposal to relieve Consuls of IncomeTax. Men of the Diplomatic Service were not so exempt, andwould be sure to resent any differential treatment. The treasury had just concluded an agreement with the Foreign Office in regardto Diplomatic Service, and it was impossible for his Departmentnow to agree to Consuls being treated differently in thisrespect. He wished to know wdiether, in grading the pay, regardhad been had to the emoluments drawn by. other officials inGovernment service ; for instance, the yearly increment now askedfor vice-consuls was 25Z., whereas he believed that in the caseof other officials ^^the same scale of salary, it was 20Z.only. It was, perhaps, unfortunate that, in the case of officers indifferent services, holding different posts and drawing the samesalaries, identical nomenclature was used. No doubt somethingmust be done to improve our commercial services abroad. If,however, the broad lines of the scheme were approved in principle bythe War Cabinet, was it intended to start at once to give effect to thescheme on a big scale all over the -world, or would the Foreign Officeproceed tentatively in order to gain experience as time went on ?The Director of Overseas Trade pointed out that the pay, apart from local allowances, was based on rank. Officialsabroad, however, could never really divest themselves of their representative capacity. In England it was possible for an official,after his day&apos;s work Avas over, to go and bury himself in a suburb,but this Avas impossible in a place like Rome. If our representativesAvere to get useful information they must do a considerable amountof entertaining; this necessity Avas inherent in their position. Asregards income tax, he thought that a case could be made out for both the Consuls and men in the Diplomatic Service to be exempted.Our men abroad were subjected now to two taxes, owing to the Avar,Avhile officials at home got off Avith one.   The Chancellor had
enquired why the Tilley Scheme&apos; and the scheme now before theCabinet had followed in such quick succession. The fact wasthat the Tilley Committee had had no time to cover the whole groundexhaustively, whereas bis enquiry had been of the most detailedcharacter. In regard to the Chancellors question as to whetherit was intended to &quot;proceed at once on a big scale, he thoughtit would be possible, though not desirable, to curtail initialexpenditure by cutting out a certain number of posts. He wishedto draw attention to the fact that, unless sanction were quicklyaccorded, the majority of applicants for these new posts who werebeing carefully nursed by his Department--would get tired of waiting and would be lost to the Service.Mr. Bonar Law said that he understood that special allowances were based on the cost of living in foreign countries, and had been- calculated with a view to meeting the case of income tax. he agreed that something had to be done to remedy the defects in ourConsular Service. The question was, how much His Majesty&apos;sGovernment could afford. A Royal Commission had made certain recommendations for the improvement of our Consular Service, but no action had followed, and there was an uneasy feeling inParliament that the Service had been neglected by the Government.The War Cabinet could not be expected to settle that morningquestions of detail; these must be decided by the Foreign Office inconsultation with the Treasury. In adjusting the various scales of pay, care must necessarily be taken to make the various scales inthe different services analogous. He thought, however, that theWar Cabinet must fix the initial number of new posts. He wishedto know whether it was intended that men to fill these new posts who would be appointed for trade purposes only should be selected by, and be responsible to, the Foreign Office or the Board of Trade.His own feeling was that they should be under a Trade Department.Further, who should be responsible for deciding where the newposts where to be ?The Director of Overseas Trade said that his proposal was that the locality of the new posts, and the men to fill them,should be selected by the Foreign Office, in consultation with theBoard of Trade.The President of the Board of Trade agreed that the presentnomenclature adopted in the scheme was not satisfactory. his department agreed that Consuls should remain with the ForeignOffice. He suggested that the War Cabinet might accept in principle the main features of the scheme, leaving details to be settled by theForeign Office, with his own Department and the Treasury; allcontroversial questions, such as that of Trades Commissioners, being left over for the time being.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that the first part ofthe scheme might be accepted in principle, but the details as toscales of pay should be decided between the Foreign Office and theTreasury, and that no new post should be created without Treasurysanction. It was not a sufficient check to lay down that the Boardof Trade must be consulted whenever trade interests were involved.The War Cabinet decided (a.) That the first part of the scheme, as regards the ConsularService, should be approved in principle.(b.) That, as regards the number of posts, the Foreign office should be empowered to create thirty new posts, inconsultation with the Board of Trade, but that any newposts beyond that number would require Treasurysanction.(c.) With the exception of exemption from income tax, to approve the scales of pay and allowances proposedsubject to modifications in certain details, e.g.,the scale of increment; these details to be agreed between Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland and the Treasury,[826J-689 B 2
and to be so adjusted as to bring the rates of pay as much into line as possible with those accepted dorthe Foreign Office and Diplomatic Services.Unemployment 2. With reference to War Cabinet 572, Minute 4, the Ministerona ion. Qf Labour again raised the question of the continuance of theUnemployment Donation to disabled and discharged soldiers. he stated that many discharged soldiers were now reaching the end oftheir period of twenty-six weeks, some would finish at the end ofthis week, and 9,000 at the end of next week. His original intentionhad been not to extend the time limit, but he had become convincedthat something had to be done for the discharged and disabled soldiers. When the War Cabinet had previously discussed thissubject it was decided that uneuployment pay on a modified andgraduated scale should be continued to disabled men only. the debate this week in the Flouse of Commons, however, had convincedhim that there was considerable feeling in the country in favour ofassistance to discharged soldiers as well. If nothing were done itwas probable that demonstrations similar to the recent outbreak inParliament Square would become general. The discharged soldiers&apos;societies were in a dangerous mood and tainted with Bolshevism.The Glasgow society had converted itself into something like a soviet, and had changed its name to &quot; The International discharged soldiers&apos; Society,&quot; and he understood that they were now in touchwith Russian Bolsheviks. The Policw and the Triple Alliance were also active, and he thought, considering the disturbed state of these organisations, that the Government could not afford to run anyrisks. His proposal to the Cabinet, therefore, was that, when theperiod of twenty-six weeks expired, the Unemployment Donationshould be continued for a further period of thirteen weeks to. discharged and disabled soldiers, at a reduced rate of 20s.   TheMinister of Labour admitted that a certain Dumber of ex-soldierswere drawing their pension allowance for children as well as theUnemployment Donation allowance for children, but he hoped tomake arrangements with the Minister of Pensions to meet this abuse.The Minister of Pensions said that, in theory, the abuse shouldnot happen. Strictly speaking, the grant from the pensions ministry was given to a man to cover disablement when in work.The Financial Secretary to the War&apos;Office said that, from arecruiting point of view, the War Office would be very glad to dropaltogether the payment of the donation to ex-soldiers, but he feared that this was politically impossible, in view of the extension givento civilians.The First Lord of the Admiralty said it was true that there wasa general objection to the payment of the unemployed donation, butthere was a still stronger objection to the large number of personsin receipt of the donation who could get work if they chose.The Chancellor of the Exchequer feared that the extension ofthe period by a further thirteen weeks might create a shortage inthe labour required for the harvest, and he would be glad if the- Minister of Labour could find some means of obviating this difficulty.Mr. Bonar Law thought the Government had no option butto extend the period, especially as the civilian donation was being continued until November, and this was the first extension of timethe soldiers had received.The Minister of Labour said that it had been promised that noextension in the donation would be granted without consulting theHouse of Commons, but he supposed this could be clone by. question and answer.The Chancellor of the Exchequer hoped that the Minister ofLabour would explain to representatives of the press that everythingwas being done to prevent abuse of the unemployed benefit, but thatthe case of discharged and disabled soldiers was a special one.
The War Cabinet agreed that *- *The unemployment donation should be extended for a further period of thirteen weeks to discharged and disabled soldiers, at a reduced rate of 20s.Physical Research &apos;3. With reference to War Cabinet 179, Minute 12, and WarInstitution for the Cabinet 53.1, Minute 0, the War Cabinet had under consideration&apos;navy- the  Report (Paper G.-240) of the Committee which had beenappointed to enquire into the Admiralty proposal that a PhysicalResearch Institution be established for the Navy.The War Cabinet decided To approve the recommendations of the Committee as set outin their Report.Sale of EnemyPrize Ships to south Africa.4. Mr. Bonar Law said that he had received from GeneralBotha a letter (Paper G.T.-7369), which had been circulated to theWar Cabinet, urging that the Imperial Government should sell tothe Union Government three of the enemy ships which had been captured during the war. General Botha had pressed this matter very strongly in conversation with himself, and had pointed to thefact that, whereas Australia had appropriated to her own usesthe fifteen enemy ships captured in her territorial waters during thewar, those captured in South African waters (thirteen in number)had been handed over to the Imperial Government, to whom theyhad been of the greatest service. General Botha now represented that it was vital for the Union Government to obtain three ships, inorder to carry on her services and for the development of thecountry ; and it was suggested that the ships should be sold tothe Union Government at the price at which they were condemnedby the Prize Court. Mr. Bonar Law pointed out that the UnionGovernment would thus be obtaining a bargain, since they wereassessed by the Prize Courts at pre-war rates, and their value was now considerably enhanced. The Shipping Controller disliked theproposal. On the other hand, if we refused to sell to the SouthAfrican Government the ships they asked for, they might put in a claim for all the enemy vessels captured in their territorial waters.On the whole, he (Mr. Bonar Law) was inclined to regard therequest as reasonable, and one in which the War Cabinet couldconcur.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To agree to the proposal that the Imperial Governmentshould sell to the Union Government three of the enemyprize ships captured in South African waters, at theprice at which the ships had been condemned by thePrize Court, subject to agreement between the UnionGovernments experts and the Ministry of Shipping asto the type of ship to be sold :(6.) The above decision to be subject to the general arrange-ments to be made with the Allies as to the disposal of enemy ships. In the meantime, the South african government to be allowed the use of the ships.Pood Supplies forthe Inhabitants ofthe OceupiedTerritories ofGermany.5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the War Cabinetthat when he had been in Parjs the Prime Minister had receivedurgent representations that the population of the occupied territories of Germany was on the verge of starvation, a fact that was giving rise to serious discontent amongst the men in the Armies ofOccupation. At that time no provision had been made forvictualling the whole of Germany, and, after careful consideration
and on the assurance of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff thatthe feeding of&quot; the inhabitants of the occupied territories wasnecessary to keep our soldiers contented, he (Mr. Chamberlain) had agreed that the Quartermaster-General should be authorised toissue from the stores the amount of food necessary ; subsequentlyconsiderable quantities of potatoes had been provided. Whenarrangements had been made for feeding Germany, their delegates had led us to believe that the German Government would pay for the food supplied ; but it was now quite clear that theywould not pay for the people in the occupied territories to receivenearly twice as much food as the inhabitants of the remainder ofGermany. Our military authorities, on the other hand, were ofthe opinion that, for the purpose of maintaining order in these districts, the minimum ration of the people should be about30 per cent, more than that agreed upon for the other partsof Germany. Owing to the depreciation in the value of the mark, the population were unable to purchase the food at its cost price, and the cost of the additional ration in the British areas ofoccupation amounted to 460,000L, of which the local authorities onthe left bank of the Rhine were prepared to pay 60 per cent.,or 276,OO0L, it being suggested that the remaining 1S4,000L shouldbe negotiated by way of a loan. Our chief financial representatives in Paris were asking for instructions in this matter, and he(Mr. Chamberlain) would like the guidance of the War Cabinet asto what answer he was to give. On the one hand, it appeared a dangerous thing to lead the rest of Germany to believe that an allied occupation would mean that their food supplies would beincreased by 30 per cent. ; on the other hand, we had the assurance of the military authorities that the additional ration was necessary if we were to maintain order in the occupied areas and keep con-tented our troops who were there.The War Cabinet requested The Chancellor of the Exchequer to take an opportunity of raising this question when in Paris.-2, Whitehall Gardens, 8 W. 1,May 30, 1919.o
