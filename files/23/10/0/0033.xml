The War Cabinet, at the request of the Home Secretary,considered the Report of the Committee appointed by the PrimeMinister, under the Chairmanship of Lord Justice Bankes, toconsider the cases of persons in Government Offices not of british or Allied parentage (Command Paper 1919, No. 195) (g. 251). .The Home Secretary stated that the following question wasbeing asked by Sir John Butcher in the.House of Commons : &quot; To ask the Prime Minister, whether the number of personsemployed in Government Offices who are not children of natural-born subjects of this country or of an Allied country, and as towhom there is no definite national reason for such employment,&apos; has been found by Lord Justice Bankes&apos; Committee to be 849 ;whether he can state in how many of these cases, respectively,both parents were enemy subjects ; one parent only was anenemy subject; one parent only was a neutral subject; bothparents were neutral subjects ; and the nationality was un-known : whether he can state how many of these 849 personshave been removed from their employment; and to which of theabove classes the persons so removed belong.&quot;The Report of the Committee had been published, and all theinformation asked for in Sir John Butcher s question was contained[826]-755 . B
in it, except as to the action taken on the Report. In fact, no action had been taken, and not a single person had been removed from theCivil Service in consequence of the Report. The only action con-templated was with reference to those who join the Civil Service inthe future, and regulations were now being drafted. He was ofopinion that the names of persons for whose continued employmentthere were, in the opinion of the Committee, definite national reasons,should not be published ; it would constitute a grave injustice tothem, and Lord Justice Bankes and the other members of the.Com-mittee were of the same opinion. He had therefore arranged thatthey should not be published. Sir John Butcher asked, in his question, how many of the 849 persons had been removed from theirappointments, and to what classes they belonged. He proposed to answer that none had been removed, but, as there was sure to be a supplementary question as to what action would be taken, he wouldlike the sanction of the Cabinet to answer that action would only betaken with reference to the admission of aliens to the Civil service in future. No department had, in fact, taken any action at all.The armistice had come before the Committee reported, and therewas now no danger ; while, on the other hand, the departmentsgenerally were under-manned and under-staffed.The President of the Board of Trade pointed out that a serious position might arise if it were known that aliens were being retained in Government service for no reason of national importance, while there were a large number of officers who had fought in the warunemployed.The First Lord of the Admiralty concurred with the view putforward by the President of the Board of Trade.  ,The President of the Board of Trade suggested that thequestion might be specially referred to the Committee under theMinister of Labour (appointed by War Cabinet 577, Minute 2),which was at present considering the substitution of disabled ex-service men for women temporarily employed in GovernmentDepartments, but in that case it would be necessary to consider inhow many of the 849 cases one of the parents of the person underconsideration was of British birth.The Home Secretary said that he would be prepared to reply inthe House of Commons that the Government were now considering how far it was possible to replace these people by men who had served in the war. It would, however, mean compensation being given to those who were turned out of the Civil service. Therewas nothing against any of them.The President of the Board of Trade said that he would besatisfied with that reply, and did not think it possible for theGovernment to go further.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The home Secretary should reply to questions inParliament that the Government were now considering how far it was possible to replace persons in government offices not of British or Allied parentage by men whohad served in the war;(6.) The Committee appointed by the War Cabinet at their meeting on the 6th June, 1919, under the chairmanship of the Minister of Labour (War Cabinet 577, Minute 2),should be requested to examine the cases of personsemployed by the Government, of whom Lord JusticeBankes&apos; Committee were, unable to report that theywere satisfied that definite national reasons existed for continuing their employment.
3WC 58510iNurses Registra-tion Bill.Compensation forSubsidence Bill.Responsibility forDepartments.2. The Minister of Health requested the War Cabinet to con-sider the position of the two Nurses Registration Bills, which werebeing promoted by private members, one in the House of commons and the other in the House of Lords.It was understood that the Red Cross Organisation were sup-porting the Bill in the House of Lords. The Bill in the House ofCommons had been introduced by Captain Barnett, and had now reached the report stage.The two Bids had become the subject of acute controversy.He had brought the contesting parties together, but had found it quite impossible to effect a compromise ; he had found that neither of the Bills had been drafted on tbe right lines, and their supporterswere inclined to admit in private that the only solution was for theGovernment to take the matter in hand on their own lines. he desired Cabinet authority to say that the Government accepted theprinciple of the registration of nurses, and that in view of the acutecontroversy over the existing Bills would undertake to introduce a simple Mill for the registration of nurses.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the quarrel overthe two Bills was of long standing and he was rather alarmed atthe Government offering to deal with the matter, but, if Dr. Addisonsaw his way to do it, he had no objection to offer.Dr. Addison said that he thought hf could undertake the matter,but would refuse in the House of Commons to give any pledge asto time and would submit a draft Bill to the Cabinet in due course.The War Cabinet decided that The Minister of Health should be authorised to state in theHouse of Commons on behalf of the Government that inview of the controversy between the partisans of the twoBills for the Registration of Nurses, the Government would undertake to draft and introduce into Parliament a Billfor Nurses&apos; Registration.o. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Home Secretary on Compensation for Subsidence (G.T.-7537).The Home Secretary stated that a Bill, which was beingpromoted in the House of Commons by a private Member Mr. Brace, and other Labour Members of Parliament, was read asecond time on the 30th May. The Bill was to provide for compensation for damage to houses, buildings, and public workscaused or likely to be caused by subsidence occasioned by miningor quarrying operations. At the request of the Whips the binder-Secretary of the Home Office had watched the Bill on behalf of theGovernment, but had made it quite clear that he was speaking forthe Government as a whole, and not for his Department, and thatwhile offering no objection to the second reading the provisions would require careful examination at a subsequent stage. TheHome Office had no locus standi in the matter. Their only interestin mines was in respect of the health and safety of the workers, andin his opinion the Bill, which was partly for the protection of thesmall householder, and partly for the protection of local authorities,came within the jurisdiction of the Local Government Board. TheHome Office had not on its staff anyone who was familiar with thesubject. The Home Office were already charged with several Billsproperly pertaining to other Departments, and he asked to be relieved of this further responsibility.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the same question had been raised when he was President of the Local GovernmentBoard. In his opinion the question was essentially one for theChief Law Officers of the Crown, involving as it did questions of tenure of land and complicated legal points. There were cases inwhich whole villages were threatened, and the matter required mostB 2
careful consideration from the legal point of view. The HomeSecretary of that time held the same view, and eventually thematter was referred to the Attorney-General, but was found to beso contentious that it got no further.The Minister of Health said that the Bill raised immediately anumber of difficult questions relating to law and property in whichthe Local Government Board had no competence. He felt that theHome Office had more knowledge of coal mines than the LocalGovernment Board, although they had not hitherto interestedthemselves in this aspect. He agreed that so far as concernedhousing, the Bill was of interest to . the Local Government Board,and particularly in respect of land required for housing, but trustedthat the Local Government Board would not be asked to representthe Government in the matter, as they knew nothing about thevery difficult legal questions involved. A Memorandum was being prepared for the Government in reference to land for housing inwhich the question for subsidence was raised, but it was not yet ready for circulation.The War Cabinet decided That the Home Secretary, the Minister of Health, and the attorney-General should confer as to what shall j be thepolicy of the Government towards the Bill, and which department should be responsible for watching the courseof the Bill in the House of Commons.4. The Home Secretary stated that arrangements had beenmade for a message to be sent by the King- on the signature of Peaceto the Heads of all the Allied States. The Colonial Office haddrafted a message for the Overseas Dominions. He suggested thatit would be preferable for the same message to cover the whole empire, including the United Kingdom, in which case the ColonialOffice considered that the draft would require some alteration.The Minister of Health enquired whether India was included.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that it was settledsome time ago that the term &quot;Overseas Dominions&quot; should, always be deemed to include India. He certainly hoped that the samemessage would be sent throughout the Empire.The War Cabinet decided That the message to be submitted for His Majesty&apos;s approvalshould be so drafted as to cover the whole of the BritishEmpire.Congestion of Ports 5. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandum in the United by the Food Controller (Paper G.T.-7558) on the congestion of portsKingdom. in the United Kingdom, in which it was stated that unless action was taken immediately it was feared that there would be a shortageof imported foodstuffs in general, and of bacon, meat, cereals, andtea in particular, the cause of the present difficulties being the inability of the ports to discharge and despatch the largeimportations which were now reaching them. It had beenarranged that during the ensuing nine weeks there should be a weekly average importation of 15,500 tons of bacon, but theShipping Controller, owing to the congestion in the ports of Londonand Liverpool, had been obliged to cable that he could only handle2,000 and 3,000 tons of bacon at those two ports respectively duringthe next nine weeks. The weekly consumption of bacon was approximately 10,000 tons, and the reserves were negligible.The Food Controller said that the bacon question had largelybeen eased. The Shipping Controller had cancelled the order to stop. shipments, as he had found that the bacon would come inMessage from theKing on the signature of Peace.
American ships if it were not shipped in British. He desired,however, to direct attention to the main question of congestion inthe ports. He had originally thought that it was due to a shortageof shipping, but was now informed that it was almost solely owingto inability to clear the goods from the ports. He suggested thatan immediate enquiry should be held to devise means to clear the ports rapidly. He also asked that power should be taken to giveabsolute priority, of discharge and handling to foodstuffs.The President of  the   Board of Trade said   that he was rather  surprised that the question   bad   been   put   down   fordiscussion at that meeting.    An enquiry had been taking place at the Board of Trade, and the  Report was now before him and was ready for circulation to the Cabinet.    There was nonecessitv for a further enquiry, and the full facts could be consideredby the Cabinet without loss of time.   The real difficulty was that,for various reasons, coastwise traffic was almost entirely held up, themost important reason being that the railway rates remained at their pre-war level and had not been increased proportionately withshipping rates.   It was recommended that the Government shouldtake power immediately to raise railway rates.   Under the Ways and communications Bill there was machinery for the purpose, but owing to the delay in the passage of that- Bill through Parliament,it would not be possible to rely upon it.   The question whether itwas possible to raise the rates under the Defence of the Realm Acthad been examined, and it was doubtful whether it would be legal todo so. Consequently, the only course was to introduce a very short Billin Parliament permitting a slight immediate increase in freight rates.The question of railway rates was extremely far-reaching ; it wasblocking all the terminals.    An additional effect was that lowrailway&apos; rates for goods very often included collection and delivery,and before the war the railways had given a rebate for privatecollection and delivery.   The rate of the rebate was now too small,and the railway rates were not big enough to permit of its increase.For example, to take an extreme case, the railways in some instanceswere carrying coal at a haulage rate of 8s. a ton, and the cartagerates ,for delivery from the terminal were as high as 10s.   Therailways could not meet the enormous increase in cartage because there was a shortage of horses and lorries, and very great difficultyin  getting  the  right type of lorry.    Probably, so  far as therailways were concerned-, the terminal block was the most im-portant item in connection with the  congestion.    Raising  therates,  and  with  them  the rebates, would  be  a  partial  cureonly; it would probably encourage coastwise shipping, but not sufficiently;   and it might  also be necessary to put coastwise shipping under Government control.   There were certain steps which could be taken immediately, if the Cabinet authorised them,which would do much to relieve the situation.   The government might charter coastwise shipping and so divert traffic from therailways.   It was also necessary to consider what was to be done with the surplus Government railway wagons in France, some25,000 which were not required there, and the number of locomotiveengines which the Railway Companies at present refused to buy.These were held by the Surplus Disposal Board for sale, and, in thecase of the wagons, would be sold to private traders who, if the ways and Communications Bill became law, would have to sellshem back to the Government.   He suggested that the Board ofTrade should be authorised to organise, out of the railway materialm the hands of the War Office or the Ministry of Munitions, a central Government pool of rolling stock the Government placing&quot; themselves in the position of a private trader for the time beingwith regard to the use of the wagons on the railways and also toorganise out of the lorries under the Road Transport Board asystem for dealing with traffic in which the Government are directly interested.
G, The Food Controller suggested that he should confer with SirAuckland Geddes, iu order to see how much of the proposed steps could be put into operation at once, lie could not run risks in thematter of food importation.Sir Norman  [ill said he was surprised to hear the Food Con-troller suggest that the question of bacon was eased. It was truethat the Shipping Controller might bring it over in ships, but itwould stop on board, owing to the congestion at the ports ; and, ifhe should succeed in disembarking it, it would stop on the quays.He contemplated with dismay the prospect of large drvmps of mildbacon lying on the quayside in July and August. It was not a portproblem that had to be dealt with, but a question of distributingfacilities. The ports were blocked because goods, did not go outof the ports as freely as they came in. In his opinion, the questionof railway rates and coasting traffic must be tackled at once. Owingto the railways being subsidised by the State, there was great corn-petition for railway traffic at the expense of the coastwise shipping.The Shipping Controller desired to state that a great deal of delay had been caused by the Ways and Communications Bill, tosuch an extent that matters must now be dealt with as they stood,without waiting for the passage of that Bill into law. The matternow under discussion had already been before the War Cabinet(War Cabinet 522, Minute 6), and had been referred to Sir eric geddes, but at present he was without powers. The only solutionwas under the powers conferred by the Defence of the Realm Act,to put a rate on the carriage of goods by rail that would be highenough to cause trade to flow in its pre-war channels, including the resumption of the coasting trade. The question was extremelyurgent. About 130,000 tons of bacon would be received in the next two months, and would be piled up in Liverpool and else wherein the hot weather unless something were done to relieve the congestion.Lord Curzon pointed out that, while Sir Joseph Maclayrecommended the use of the Defence of the Realm Act, Sir auckland geddes said that legislation would be necessary.The President of the Board of Trade said that, in the opinionof his advisers, the Defence of the Realm Act could not ,now beused for such a purpose. If higher railway charges were imposed under the Defence of the Realm Act Regulation any traderwho refused to pay them might take the matter to the Railway and canal Commission for decision, and the question of the legal validity of the Regulation would at once be raised. In his Opinion avery short Bill was all that was necessary. He had already held*a meeting of the General Managers and Goods Managers of theRailway Companies&apos; and that was the course they recommended.Lord Curzon agreed with a suggestion made by Sir A. Geddesthat the further consideration of the matter should be deferred until the Board of Trade Memorandum had been circulated, whichit was understood would be done at once.,&apos;The War Cabinet decided (a.) To adjourn the discussion of this matter until a Meetingearly in the following week.(b.) That in the interval the Departments concerned should confer and consider how far they could agree on theproposals contained in the Board of Trade Memorandumreferred to.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,June 26, 1919.o
