The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had seen oneAfghanistan. . or tw0 telegrams from India which indicated that a disquietingsituation had arisen in Afghanistan, and enquired whether the most recent information confirmed this.Lord Curzon said that the Secretary of State for India had come to see him the previous evening in regard to the news whichhad been communicated by the Government of India. One of the telegrams received referred to the truculent attitude recentlyadopted by the Amir. It appeared that fresh difficulties had arisenover Tor Khan, which was close to Lundi Khana, and was on theAfghan frontier. The local officials in that area had been issuingproclamations of a disturbing character. A much more disquietingfeature was a proclamation by the Amir of a most outrageous[826]-608 B
nature, stating that both Moslems and Hindus in India were being subjected to abominable treatment by the British Administration.This proclamation had followed on the statement issued by the Amira short time previously, which was tantamount to a declaration of complete independence. In view of this, the Viceroy proposed to close the Khaibar Pass, to stop the Amirs subsidy, and to tell him that, unless he cancelled the objectionable proclamation,we would break off relations with him. Lord Curzon said thathe had advised the Secretary of State to approve the Viceroy&apos;proposal to insist on the withdrawal of the Firman, but he hadcounselled him against connecting the withdrawal of the subsidywith the issue of the proclamation, as he himself felt that thewhole question of our relations with Afghanistan might haveto be reconsidered at an early date on its own merits, andHis Majesty&apos;s Government might decide in favour of allowingAfghanistan to be completely independent and oiE discontinuing thesubsidy. In other words, the Amir had, by his recent attitude,afforded us an opportunity of revising our relations with him. Wecould, in fact, say to him, &quot; You want your independence, and weare prepared to give it to you ; but, of course, this means that youno longer require any financial help from us &quot; ; or, alternatively, wecould say, &quot; You have, by your recent action, forfeited your right tothe subsidy.&quot; It further appeared from the telegrams that the amir had constituted an Eastern circle, or- theatre of action, with anAfghan official in command. There was ho definite indication thatthe Amir intended to attack us, but the atmosphere was electrical.The attitude of the Afridis near the Khaibar was reported to be(piite satisfactory, but the Shinwaris and Mohmands were said tobe in an unsettled state. A further telegram stated that theOommander-in-Chief in India was asking for reinforcements.(At tills point the Secretary of State for India entered the Cabinet.)The Secretary of State for War remarked that quite recently the Commander-in-Chief had refused an offer from the War Officeof three squadrons of aeroplanes.The Secretary of State for India said that until he had seen thelatest telegrams he had had no idea that the Indian government regarded the situation as in any way alarming. The recent internaldisturbances in India had not spread to the North-West frontier of India, and all had been reported quiet until the capture of mendacious Firman promulgated by the Amir, which he himselfthought was obviously designed to prevent the spread intoAfghanistan of the disorder which the Amir believed to be prevalentin India. Mr. Montagu said that he was surprised at the pressingdemands from India for reinforcements, as the Indian Governmenthad two very powerful weapons to hand ; first, the non-payment ofthe subsidy, a threat of which would be all the more efficacious asthe Amir could not now, as in former days, appeal to Russia ; and,second, the closing of the Khaibar and other passes to Afghancaravans. On the other hand, we had received a number of telegrams drawing attention to the fact that Moslem opinion all overthe world was profoundly affected by Mohammedan apprehensions of the treatment that the Allies were believed to be about to meteout to Turkey. It was because of these apprehensions, and the unrest they would naturally create, that, in his view, theCommander-in-Chief was now taking precautionary measures todeal with disturbances on the North-West Frontier, in Afghanistan,and elsewhere.Lord Curzon said that it appeared that at present theCommander-in-Chief in India was only safeguarding himself againsttribal disturbance.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that, if theCommander-in-Chief was asking for reinforcements from Meso-
potamia, lie must regard the situation as critical. In thesecircumstances he considered that the Indian&apos; Government shouldhave addressed the Secretary of State for India direct.Lord Curzon pointed out that the request for reinforcementswas for material, and not for men.The Secretary of State for War then read out one of the telegrams which had been received by the War Office from themilitary authorities in India. He thought this communicationrevealed a somewhat serious situation. It was evident that theCominander-in-Chief contemplated military operations on theNorth-West Frontier; he also proposed to retain in India Britishtroops whom we were under a strong obligation to return to thiscountry without further delay. He was prepared to acquiesce inthe requests of the Commander-in-Chief, but he thought it only fairthat the British troops retained in India should be told that theirreliefs would be sent out very shortly.The Secretary of State for India then read a further telegram which he had just received from his Department, which stated thatthe Viceroy, on the advice of Sir George lioos-Keppel, had authorised the ejection of Afghans from the Bagh Springs ; that troops werebeing moved upi to the frontier in overwhelming strength, so as togive the Afghans an excuse for peaceful retirement; that the Viceroyhad written to the Amir, but doubted whether his letter would have much effect as the Indian Government thought the Amir had been compelled by internal trouble to adopt his present attitude ; that theIndian Government had given Roos-Keppel a free hand to negotiateAvith the tribes, and that the Commander-in-Chief was confident ofthe adequacy of the forces at his disposal.Lord Gurzon said that one of the earlier telegrams had indicated that the position of the Amir in his own country was insecure and thathis uncle Nasruliah had been poisoned in prison. In reply to aquestion, Lord Curzon said that he thought that it was most unlikelythat tiie Viceroy would desire to despatch a force into Afghanistan.The situation, so far as we could envisage it correctly, was ominous.The Amir, on ascending the throne, had been compelled to increasethe pay of his army in order to secure his position; he had heardrumours of disturbances in India ; he knew that the whole Moslemworld was greatly perturbed about the future of Turkey ; and he hadseized this opportunity of consolidating his power by appealing tothe patriotism of fanaticism of his subjects.The Secretary of State for War said that, if the emergencyproved a real one, he would undertake to supply substantialreinforcements to India, but in this case he would ask the permission of the War Cabinet to inform the public of the gravity of thesituation. He suggested that, if it were necessary to send out acertain number of white battalions, he should be authorised to announce that these would arrive in time to meet the emergency ;and that if, on their arrival in India, the situation was easier and itwas found that they were not really required, they would be utilisedto release British troops who, properly speaking, should have beendemobilised some time back. He hoped, however, that the WarCabinet would not ask him to make extensive preparations withoutpermitting him to enlighten the public as to the crisis which hadrendered this action necessary.Lord Curzon expressed the hope that, in any announcement which the Secretary of State for War might make, he would notrefer to the sinister possibilities in Afghanistan, as the effect inIndia, Persia, and Mesopotamia might be serious. The presenttrouble might blow over, and in the meantime, he suggested thatthe Secretary of State for India should exercjse a discreet reticencein replying to questions in Parliament.The War Cabinet took note of the recent telegrams describing the situation in Afghanistan and the North-West Frontier, and of the
statements made by Lord Curzon, the Secretary of State for India,and the Secretary of State for War, and requested The Secretary of State for India to keep them fully informed of developments by arranging for the early circulation of allmessai.es which might pass between the Government ofIndia and his Department in respect of the said situation.2&apos;Yee Passages to ex-Soldiers.2. The War Cabinet took note that the Ministry of Shipping,after discussion with the Colonial Office, desired to withdraw their memorandum of the 8th April, 1919, on the proposal to grant freepassages to ex-soldiers and their dependents to settle abroad (paper g.T.-708S), as the question had since been settled inter-departmentally, and a decision of the War Cabinet was no longer required.Provision ofEussian Qflicersfor Service in north Russia andSiberia.3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War regarding the provision of Russianofficers for service in North Russia and Siberia (Paper G.T.-7165).The Memorandum stated that, since the signing of thearmistice, it had become increasingly evident that an indefinitecontinuance of the occupation of parts of North Russia by allied troops was neither desirable nor feasible, and that an early oppor-tunity for withdrawal must be sought. It was therefore incumbenton the British Government to provide for those Russians who had remained loyal to, and had fought for, the Allied cause in thoseregions. The formation of an efficient Russian national force was.urged as one of the first necessary steps to the attainment of thisobject, and it was stated to be essential to secure Russian officers from some source and despatch them without delay to Archangel.Tor this purpose the General Staff had calculated that it would benecessary to provide a body of 675 officers for the Archangel area,besides 25 for the Murmansk theatre making a total for north russia of 700. It was also considered necessary to despatch 500Russian officers to Vladivostock. In order to carry out this scheme,the Memorandum asked for authority (a.) To provide these Russian officers with free transport tothe United Kingdom from the country where they were now living, and from the United Kingdom to Archangelor Vladivostock.(b.) To feed them during the period from their departure forthe United Kingdom until their arrival in Russia.(c.) To outfit them completely with British uniforms andequipment.(cl.) To enable them to provide themselves with other articles,and to meet small current expenses.It was stated that, although an accurate estimate of the cost ofthe scheme could not be given, 100Z. per officer, or 120,O00Z. forthe T,200 officers, would be required in the first instance.The Secretary of State for War said that the scheme outlined in his Memorandum was all part of the process of evacuating our troops from Russia, and making the Russians fend for themselves.There were now 15,000 Russian troops in North Russia, and this number would probably be increased soon to 25,000 ; in fact, he hadbeen asked to provide equipment later on for as many as 100,000Russians in that part of the world. Affairs in North. Russia were at themoment satisfactory; Admiral Kolchak was moving rapidly, and proposed to go to Archangel himself very soon ; he expected his rightwing to get to Kotlas by the 15th June, and there was no doubtthat this purely Russian army was really rolling forward, and would add to its ranks in the districts through which it proposed to-
Educational Train- 4. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memoranduming of the^Army of hy the Secretary of State for War (Paper G.T.-7103), on educationalOccupation. training in the Army of Occupation. -Lord Gorell, the Director-General of &quot;Education in the Army,said that the case in dispute between the War Office and theTreasury was whether educational instructors should receive the paythey are at present receiving, and whether they should be includedin the normal war establishment or outside it. Officers and menposted to educational duties were receiving special rates of pay, andhad remained in the Army of Occupation on account of that induce-ment. The proposal now before the, Treasury was not to increasesuch rates of pay, but to maintain them at their present level. Inthe first place, officers and men had been pledged that they shouldbe engaged purely upon educational work, and they would not[826]-608 Cadvance. Five new Russian divisions had been formed in Siberia,and were nowr being brought into action. The victories of these troops were being Avon with British weapons and uniforms. Withregard to Archangel, Mr. Churchill thought the^situation was satis-factory, and the gunboats were now being used. Plans were beingmade for handing over to Admiral Kolchak the whole of our obliga-tions in North Russia. The Prime Minister had discussed thesituation with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, and had authorised certain plans and preparations to be made, but no actionwculd be undertaken without a Cabinet decision. The&apos; reports from General Maynard were satisfactory ; the Finns had made a successful push at Petrozavodsk, and had suceeeded in cutting therailway behind the Bolshevists in front of General Maynard. Withregard to Generals Mannerheim and Yudenitch, it was very uncertain what their movements and intentions were. The WarOffice, however, were sending out a mission to investigate theposition. The only unsatisfactory news was from Esthonia and theother Baltic provinces. In conclusion, Mr. Churchill said theCabinet would therefore see the importance of carrying out thescheme of sending Russian officers to North Russia. It was quite possible that the Bolshevik regime would crumple up, and weshould get a civilised Russia friendly to us above all other Powersif events continued to proceed on satisfactory lines. lie thereforewanted to obtain for Russia every officer that was available. TheRussians were now fighting bravely, and all the help we could give them now- would facilitate the eventual evacuation of our forces from Russia and the establishment of friendly relations when peacecame.The Chancellor of the Exchecmer stated that the situation had changed since his predecessor in office had considered it unwise toprovide the financial help required, as requested by the GeneralStaff in December, and he raised no objection to the scheme as outlined by the Secretary of State for War.Lord Curzon said that he understood that the Murmanskexpedition commenced as an Allied expedition, and had neverceased to be one. He therefore thought that, although the Britishhad done all the fighting, the expenses should be borne by our allies as well as by ourselves.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this was the case,and the outlay should be charged to the joint account of the Allies,altbough the British Government would have to provide the funds in the first instance, and it was unlikely that they would ever recoveranything from France or United States of America.The War Cabinet decided that The Treasury should provide the necessary funds to transport,feed, and equip the 1,200 Russian officers whom theSecretary of State for War proposed to recruit and send to north Russia.
otherwise have remained in the army. No Treasury sanction hadbeen asked for at the time, owing to the sudden emergency in whichthe military authorities were placed in having to offer sufficientinducement to prevent the instructors from demobilising, butTreasury sanction had been obtained for the continuance of thesystem. The total number would be 2,500 officers and 7,500 men,if the full establishment were reached, but it was obvious that thefull establishment would not be reached. At present it stood atone-third, and would probably not reach more than one-half, nor would a higher proportion be necessary. The main requirementswere for the Army of the Rhine and the Home Forces. The WarOffice were also being asked for educational instructors for Murmanskand Archangel, but the chief necessity was for the Armies of the rhine, which were composed mostly of young soldiers.Lord Curzon pointed out that the Cabinet were already committed to the education of the Army by the announcement madein the House of Commons by the Secretary of State for War.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was entirely infavour of education in the army. The only question was, how was it to be done ? The only proposal before the Treasury was for an expenditure of 2,500,0OQZ., involving an allocation of four officersand twelve men to each battalion, supernumerary to the establish-ment and with extra pay. The army already had a much greater number of officers than would he required. There were waiting tobe demobilised 45,000 officers out of a total of 53,000, an excess of85 per cent., a large number of whom could be used for educationalwork. It was not too much to ask that the duties should be combined, and that officers should do their regimental work inaddition to educational work. The Treasury had agreed inDecember 1918 to an allocation of 2s. a day for officers and Is. a day for non-commissioned officers, on the representation that teacherswere entitled to immediate demobilisation. The whole system ofdemobilisation had been recast, and teachers were no longerentitled to be demobilised. In addition, a bonus had been grantedto the wdiole army, which ought to cover the allowances which hadbeen offered for instructors. Officers in the army were in receiptof high rates of pay as compared with teachers in civilian life, theaverage pay and allowances received by a subaltern being morethan the salary paid to junior masters in the great public schools.The case for special allowances and for staff supernumerary toestablishment was not a legitimate demand, particularly in view ofthe fact that, when not campaigning, the army officers worked forshorter hours than any other professional class. He must take exception to the vicious system, prevailing both in the army and inthe navy, of granting extra pay for anything outside ordinaryroutine duty. The number of officers in the army of the Rhinewas high as compared with peace-time, and should providea sufficient margin to enable educational instruction to be given aswell as military training.Mr. Fisher said that the question of officers having sufficientleisure to study was important. It must be remembered that manyof the young officers were entirely out of touch with civilian life and educational wbri, and must have time to prepare themselves forteaching. This should be borne in mind in considering whether theywere to undertake regimental duty in addition to educational work.He would much rather that one-quarter of the men were properlyeducated than the whole of the army badly educated, and for that reason he was anxious that the teachers who were employed in theArmy Scheme should be given further facilities for study.The Secretary of State for War said that the educational schemewhich had been started by his predecessor was begun at a time whengreat anxiety was felt about the army moral during the period of delay and tension in the early part of last year. It should be under-stood that the question was not to grant higher allowances, but to
Koyal OrdnanceFactories:&quot;Woolwich Arsenal.5. The War Cabinet had under consideration a letter from theSecretary of the Ministry of Munitions, covering a Report of theCommittee of Enquiry into the Royal Ordnance Factories, Woolwich(Paper G.T.-7175). The letter stated that the majority of therecommendations dealt with questions of general administration uponwhich action was being taken. They included, however, certain points of policy requiring the approvahof the War Cabinet, viz. : (i.) That the arguments in favour of the retention of a Govern-ment Arsenal for munition manufacture in peace time areoverwhelming, and that the location of that GovernmentArsenal should be at Woolwich.(ii.) That Woolwich Arsenal should be organised mainly as a peace establishment for the supply of armaments inpeace-time, and of experimental types and improveddesign in war and peace; and that its reserve of expansion, so far as its peace lay-out is concerned, belimited to increased production in the case of small wars.(iii.) That one Minister only should be solely responsible for control of the Arsenal.The Minister of Munitions said that, if the proposal were adopted, the Royal Ordnance Factories at Woolwich would beretained as a complete Arsenal, and, in conjunction with Enfield,Burton-on-Trent, and Lancaster, would be sufficient for peace-time requirements of munition armaments.Sir James Stevenson, on behalf of the Secretary of State forWar, said that the War Office concurred in the proposal At presentWoolwich Arsenal was composed of two groups: (1) OrdnanceStores (under the War Office); (2) Production (under the Ministryof Munitions). This dual administration was considered bad, andit was agreed to be desirable to decentralise the Ordnance Stores.It was intended to remove them from Woolwich, but, as stores to thevalue of some 20,000,0007. were involved, the removal would necessarily take some time. The 7,000 employees under the WarOffice would gradually be dismissed. One matter might give riseto difficulty, viz., that the Ordnance Committee, which had beenunder the Ministry of Munitions during the war, had been trans-ferred back to the War Office.Sir Benjamin Johnson, Director-General of National Factories,statedvthat control by one Minister was very desirable, and he wishedto draw particular attention to the statement by the Committee thati      Awithdraw allowances already being paid. Officers had never beforebeen asked to give instruction in civilian subjects, and would refuseto dp so if told that they would get no extra pay.The Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed that the allowances should be continued, but that officers should not be madesupernumerary to establishment.The Secretary of State for War stated that it might be possibleto come to an agreement on that basis. At the same time, he wouldlike to assure the Chancellor of the Exchequer that he was usingevery endeavour to demobilise as quickly as possible the 45,000officers who were supernumerary to establishment. &apos;Lord Curzon pointed out that the Treasury would also be relieved to the extent that oidy from one-third to one-half&apos; of the2,500,OOOZ. estimated for would be actually incurred.The War Cabinet decided that The question should be referred to the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Secretary of State for War to come toan agreement on the lines of the above discussion, and, inthe event of failure to agree, the matter should be further considered by the Cabinet.
the arguments in favour of the retention of a Government Arsenalin peace time were overwhelming, and that it should he at woolwich.The Minister of Munitions said, in reply to Mr. Chamberlain,who drew attention to the danger of accumulating large stock oexplosives in a populous district, the intention was that storage ofexplosives would ultimately be removed from Woolwich.The War Cabinet decided To approve the proposals of the Committee of Enquiry intothe Royal Ordnance Factories at Woolwich on the three points of policy above set out, and that the Minister ofSupply would be the Minister responsible.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,May 6, 1919.
