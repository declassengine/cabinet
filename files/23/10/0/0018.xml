The War Cabinet had under consideration a Joint Memo-Industry, randum by the President  of the Board of Agriculture  andFisheries and the Secretary for Scotland (Paper G.T.-7263) onthe Herring Industry, in which it was proposed that, in order tomeet the dislocation of the herring industry caused by the loss ofthe normal export markets in Russia and Germany, the Govern-ment should guarantee the herring curers against loss on theircatch of approximately 600.000 barrels, on the following terms: (a.) Until the 15th September, 1919, the curers and exportersto have the fullest opportunity to dispose of theirpickled herrings in any available markets.(b.) At the 15th September the curers to have the option tosell their remaining stocks to the Government at pricesvarying according to quality and averaging about 31.per barrel.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was alarmed atthe accumulating proposals for Government guarantees in orderto induce traders to carry on their industries. The burden on theExchequer was very heavy; and it was inconsistent, at a timewhen the Government were being pressed to abandon controls, thatthey should be equally pressed to give these abnormal guarantees.The Government were asked to assume a liability of l,8O0,0O0Z. in[826]-649 B
2order to ensure work for a period of six months, or less, for notmore than 12,000 persons, including shore workers. The total amount of unemployment benefit now being paid was l,0O0,0O0Z.,and in this case it would be cheaper for the Government to pay-unemployment benefit than to assume the liability. He was opposed to the whole proposal, which was not merely to guaranteea minimum, but in effect would encourage the greatest catch offish possible. As the amount the fish curers could sell with certainty in the open market was limited, it was possible that theGovernment might be involved in a loss of nearly the whole amount, particularly owing to the very large stocks of herrings in norway. While it was true that the herrings would keep throughthe winter, precisely the same position would arise in thefollowing year, if they were allowed to accumulate, and the samedemands would have to be faced then. We had sold to theNorwegian Government 730,000 barrels of fish, of which only200,000, barely fit for food, were being sold to Germany. Theremainder had to be converted into herring meal or manure.Similar prospects awaited us if we accumulated stocks in thiscountry. Moreover, if there were a large catch of herrings prices would fall, and the consumption in this country would increase considerably. Consequently, one effect of the guarantee must clearly be to keep off the home market a large quantity of herringswhich would otherwise come on to it in relief of the difficulties offood supply.The Secretary for Scotland said that he appreciated the gravity and the difficulty of the proposal, but suggested that an exceptional case had been made out, which must be met. Thedetails were subject to alteration. The fishermen as well as thecurers were in favour of the scheme, and were satisfied that theywould be fairly dealt with by the curers. Unless something of thekind proposed in the Memorandum were done, he was assured,beyond a question of doubt, that the fishing industry wouldcollapse. The fish curers who had hitherto financed the trade would not undertake the risk. They were unable to finance theindustry on the ordinary terms, as they would not be receiving thepayments on account from Russia and Germany, which, before theWar, had provided the necessary credits. If the herring industrycollapsed all the fishermen who had been serving in the Navy wouldbe thrown out of employment. He felt that the Government wouldbe met with very severe criticism if they did not endeavour tosecure that these men were able to resume their ordinary work.Mr. Bonar Law said that he was very much in agreement withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer. &apos; It was necessary to make a stand, or demands for assistance would be made by every trade.On the other hand, there would be a great outcry if fishermen whohad been in the Navy lost their employment. The terms of theagreement proposed were impossible, as they not only provided agmarantee against loss, but also for making a small profit andpossibly a very big profit. He suggested, as a possible alternative,that an agreement should be made that in certain circumstances the Government would buy, but only at a price involving a substan-tial loss to the fish curers as well as to the Government.The Minister of Food said a guarantee of the kind proposedin the Memorandum might be detrimental to the food supply, asit would encourage the fish curers, when gluts of fish occurred, tokeep them off the fresh fish market and pickle them. Arrange-ments were being made by the Ministry of Food to deal with thetransport of special gluts of fish, and these would be interfered with if the fish Avere not allowed freely on to the market. Therewas no home market for the cured fish, and he regarded the sug-gestion of 31. per barrel as most exorbitant. He felt it was neces-sary to make a. stand on principle, and to compel traders to take their ordinary risks. The fishing trade had always been aspeculative one. ,
2. With reference to War Cabinet 544, Minute 3, the WarCabinet had before them a Note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (Paper G.T.-7295), and a Memorandum by lord&apos;Abernon (Paper G.T.-7296) regarding the present shortage of beer, and recommending that the Cabinet should sanction anincreased output without delay.The President of the Board of Education said that the aboveMemoranda had been considered that morning by the LiquorRestrictions Committee, of which he was the Chairman, and theCommittee had! decided to recommend to the War Cabinet (a.) That the quantity of beer should be increased to28 million standard barrels, of which about 2\ millions should be reserved for allocation by the Ministry of[826]-649 B 2Increased Supplyof Beer.The President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheriespointed out that the danger was that, unless some such arrange-inent were made, the fish would not be caught at all. The nshcurers who provided die finance of the whole undertaking wouldnot start operations.Some discussion took place as to the prospects of the blockade of Germany and Russia being released.Lord Curzon pointed out that, as the fish would not be ready for the market before the autumn and would keep throughout thewinter, it was almost inconceivable that the blockade would not beraised everywhere in time for the fish to be marketed.The Acting President of the Board of Trade observed thatthere would be a very hungry Central Europe for some time, andthat there would be great demands for food from Poland, Czecho-Slovakia, and German-Austria, as well as from Germany and russia.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had not thesame objection to Mr. Bonar LawT&apos;s suggestion to fix a minimumguaranteed price for the fish at a figure so low that the traderswouicl make&apos;a substantial loss as well as die Government. He sug-gested that, if such a price were fixed, the Government should share the profit above that figure, and that the guarantee should extend only to a portion of the catch. His objections to theoriginal scheme were (1) that it would be folly to stimulate the activity of the fish curing trade to such an extent as to providefor larger&apos; catches than could be marketed in normal years;(2) that it would adversely affect the home food supply by keepingfresh fish off the market at a time like the present, when thedemand was abnormal; (3) that it would make a precedent whichwould be quoted by every other trade demanding assistance fromthe Government.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) They could not accept the proposal put forward in theMemorandum by the President of the Board of Agri-culture and Fisheries and the Secretary for Scotland.(Paper G.T.-7263).(&amp;:) If on loth September, 1919, there should be no market,or only such market as involves curers in a loss, theGovernment would be prepared to share the lossequally with the curers on a limited barrelage.(c.) The President of the Board of Agriculture and fisheries and the Secretary for Scotland should be at liberty toinform the fish curers that the Government were readyto give assistance on these lines.(d.) The President of the Board of Agriculture and fisheries and the Secretary for Scotland should put forwardfresh proposals for the consideration of the WarCabinet.
Food to areas where the population has greatlyincreased.(b.) That the average gravity should remain at 10400.(c.) That the present prices should continue.(d.) That taxation should be increased pari passu, and alarge share of the new money should be devoted tothinning out unnecessary public houses.Mr. Fisher said that the Committee, in the course of their dis-cussion, had considered the question whether any limit to outputshould be retained at all, and that the Parliamentary Secretary ofthe Local Government Board had recommended that the limit-should be abandoned, in order to shift the onus of blame from theGovernment to the trade, but that the gravity should be reduced.&quot;These proposals had been opposed by the Committee, as unlimitedbrewing led to improper competition in licensed houses and to suchirregularities as the &quot;&apos; long pull,&quot; and would render it more diffi-cult in the long run to carry out any scheme of State purchase.The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded the Cabinet thaton a former occasion he had begged them to release more beer. Onthat occasion he had supported the proposal of the Food controller to increase the barrelage to 24 millions. The Cabinet, however,had referred the question to the Committee, which had permittedan increase of the barrelage to 20 millions only. From the point ofview of taxation, moreover, he had been placed in a very difficult position, and he had explained at the time that he wished to avoidbringing the matter twice before the House of Commons. Asregards any reduction in the gravity, he had consulted the tradeand had been informed that they were strongly opposed to any reduction.The Secretary for Scotland suggested that an alternative tothe recommendations of the Committee was to remove the restric-tion altogether.After a brief discussion, in the course of which it was gener-ally agreed that the gravity should not be lowered, Mr. Bonar Lawexpressed the view that any public announcement of such increasedbarrelage as the Cabinet might decide upon should be postponed until the following Monday, in order to give the Chancellor of theExchequer an opportunity of negotiating with the brewers inrespect of further taxation. He, personally, was in favour of adopting the Committee&apos;s recommendations.The Food Controller urged that an immediate announcement was a matter of real urgency. Exceptional pressure was being brought to bear on his Department from many quarters, and hehad only a day or two previously received a representative deputa-tion, a member of which, who was a temperance advocate, had stated that unless more beer were available it would be difficult tokeep people at work. Already there were reports of disturbances in the Provinces.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had warnedMr. Fisher&apos;s Committee long ago that a niggardly increase in thebarrelage was bound to lead to unrest in the world of labour.The President of the Board of Education observed that the chancellors warning had been when they were working on a15-millions basis, since which time the barrelage had been increased to 20 millions.The Chancellor, proceeding, said that he could see no advan-tage in his negotiating with the trade, as the latter would at oncedemand an increased gravity. It was not for him, as Chancellor,to decide the amount of beer to be brewed, and its gravity; these things, unlike taxation, were not fixed with a view to the Budget.On the other hand, there was a great deal to be said for animmediate announcement, which might include a statement to theeffect that the Chancellor would consider what amended proposals he could make to Parliament in view of the proposed increase. Piesuggested  that  the   Committee&apos;s  recommendations  should  be
Office Aconinmoda- 3. With  reference  to War   Cabinet  569, Minute 1, Sirtion and Demobili- Auckland Geddes stated that he had assembled an Inter-Depart-sation mental Conference on the morning following the day on which theabove decision had been taken, which had been attended by repre-sentatives of the Home Office, the War Office, and the Ministry ofPensions, when the question of the early evacuation of theAlexandra Palace and the King George V&quot;. Hospital had been dis-cussed. As a result of the Conference he was now able to reportthat (a.) Orders have now been issued to move the civilianinterned aliens from Alexandra Palace to Frith Hill,Aldershot, at once; it is anticipated that this move willbe completed by the evening of the 22nd May, thoughthe clearing of the stores, &amp;c, from the Palace willtake a few days longer.(-&amp;.) It is hoped that the King George V. Hospital will bevacated by the 15th June, although, in view of thelarge movement of patients already in hand and theshortage of medical personnel, this date may not beaccepted in full, except that resolution 4 should stop at the word&quot; passu,&quot; and that the remaining words should be eliminated.The President of the Board of Education said, with regardto this latter suggestion, that he thought there was great political advantage in making such an announcement, as the present rate ofthinning out public houses was very slow. In regard to the recom-mendation that 2^ millions should be reserved for allocation to areas where the population had greatly increased, he suggestedthat the actual figure should be arranged by the Food Controller,in consultation with the Board of Excise. It was undoubtedlynecessary that a certain portion of the total amount of beer shouldbe at the disposal of the Ministry of Food for diversion to themore populous areas, as much of the present unrest was due to theunequal distribution. He hoped that in. any public announcementthe bulk barrelage would be announced as well as the standardbarrelage.Mr. Bonar Law said that he agreed with the Chancellor thatthe latter part of Resolution 4 should be omitted, as it would raisethe whole question of Government control prematurely.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To accept the recommendations of the Liquor Restric-tions Committee, amended as follows: (&quot;1.) The quantity should be increased to 26 millionstandard barrels, of which about 2-i- millions should be reserved for allocation by theMinistry of Food to areas where population has greatly increased.(2.) Average gravity to remain 10400.(3.) Present prices to continue.(4.) Taxation to be increased pari -passu.(5.) That the Food Controller should arrange to make anannouncement to the above effect in the House ofCommons that afternoon by means of question and answer.(c.) That the statement in regard to the increase should bein terms of bulk as well as standard barrelage.(d.) To authorise the Chancellor of the Exchequer to instruct the Board of Customs and Excise to issue the necessarypermits at once, and not to wait for the necessary amendments to the taxation proposals.
strictly&quot; adhered to. Everything physically possible,however, will be done to complete the evacuation bythe above date.Sir Auckland said that he was circulating a Memorandum(Paper G.T.-7300) to this effect to his colleagues.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,1,May 22, 1919.
