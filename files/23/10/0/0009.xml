Central Agency for 1. The War Cabinet had under consideration a MemorandumComIrulm0uS&apos;bCial hy fche Minister of Labour (Paper G.T.-7154), proposing that aCoveTiimenT8 ^ central office should be established for the issue of official communiquesDepartments Dy Government Departments, to take the place, in that respect, ofthe Press Bureau. It was proposed in the Memorandum that the publicity Branch of the Demobilisation and Resettlement Depart-ment of the Ministry of Labour should undertake this work onbehalf of all Government Departments which were not desirous of doing it themselves.The War Cabinet also had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary (Paper G.T.-71G0), in which the view was expressed that the press were strongly opposed to the proposal, that theordinary press agencies would do the work better than any officialmachinery, and that, where it was required to arrange a conference between a Minister and journalists, the Minister concerned could make his own arrangements through the Newspaper Proprietors&apos;Association.General Swinton, on behalf of the Minister of Labour, saidthat it had been a great convenience to the Ministry of Labour, as a department, to have a central issuing point for official comnumica-tions, and that, as the Press Bureau no longer existed, other Depart-ments would also require the same service. The three principal pressagencies the Press Association, the Exchange Telegraph Com-pany, and the Central News Agency covered a large part of theground, but did not reach specialised weekly papers; nor did theycarry out the localised publicity especially required by some Govern-ment Departments. It was proposed to institute a service of cyclistmessengers to the different newspaper offices in London. Wliilenewspapers had been averse to the Press Bureau, their objectionshad not been on account of its work in distributing official coinmuni-cations. No doubt the Press Association and one or two of the bigger newspapers would be against the new proposal, but the press at large would favour it.Sir Edward Troup, on behalf of the Home Secretary, said that asimilar suggestion had originally been put forward by the HomeSecretary in February last, in a Memorandum issued to the War-Cabinet (Paper G.T.-G742), but in a later Memorandum (paper g.T.-7160) the suggestion had been withdrawn, on the ground thatthe newspapers desired the Press Bureau to disappear altogether,and would strongly object to another Department being maintained for the issue of communications to the press. He desired to draw attention to a mistake in the Memorandum of the Minister ofLabour, in which it was said that the home Office and the Ministryof Education were of opinion that the absence of a central issuingpoint would cause great inconvenience. That was not so. Beforethe war the Home Office had always found it easy to circulate theirannouncements through the press agencies. As regards technical- matters, it was necessary to have a special list of technical news-papers, which was compiled in the Home Office. To avoid jealousylie would not confine the issue to the Press Association, but would circulate all announcements to the leading news agencies, whichwould cover the provinces as well as London. The Press association was itself an association of newspapers. It had been the practice tosend a special copy to the Times, and possibly that might becontinued.Sir James Masterton Smith, on behalf of the Secretary ofState for War, said that Mr. Churchill was opposed to thesuggestion of the Ministry of Labour. He did not think itnecessary. It would, in fact, be a continuance of the Press Bureauunder another name, omitting the powers of censorship. The need was not a new one. There had been no difficulty, in his experience,either at the War Office, the Ministry of Munitions, or at theAdmiralty,  in  distributing  and circulating to  the newspapers
whatever was necessary. The War Office had a small PublicitySection, and were informed by the official in charge of it that the newspaper Proprietors&apos; Association were against the new proposal,and would prefer to revert to the pre-war practice. The WarOffice circulated their communications to the four press agencies,the principal London morning and evening newspapers, and theprincipal provincial papers having offices in London-, and were hopingto reduce their circulation to 130 copies in place of the 300 issuedby the Press Bureau, of which a certain number were wasted owingto overlapping in distribution. Each Department could make itsown special provision. Bo far as the War Office was concernedthere would be no saving of staff in the scheme proposed by theMinister of Labour. Moreover, he gathered that the head of theproposed central distributing agency would expect to exercise someauthority as to priority of communiques. He did not think that theAdmiralty, the War Office, or the Ministry of Munitions would beprepared to agree to that unless they were satisfied that the officer in charge was a man of considerable experience and standing. Itwas the experience of the- War Office that working journaliststhemselves would prefer direct contact with the Departments.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Admiralty were unable to accept the proposal, for much the same reasons as those already given on behalf of the War Office. The Admiralty had their own Publicity Department, and the press could go there and receive from the officer in charge the news the Admiralty desired toissxie. If the Cabinet should decide to have something of the kind proposed the Admiralty would ask to be left out, The workof the Admiralty Publicity Department was extremely well done,and they could not possibly devolve the duty upon any otherDepartment. His experience of the Press Bureau when at theColonial Office and the Admiralty was that they merely acted as adistributing agency of the communiques the Departments desired toissue.The Minister of Pensions said that, from the point of view ofhis Department, he did not think that a central distributing agencywas necessary,The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention to two lettersaddressed to the Prime Minister, one from the editor of a provincialpaper, asking that all Government announcements should lie sentthrough one agency; and the other from a society of workingjournalists, who Urged the convenience of a central issuing office in preference to the practice prevailing before the war, of journalistswaiting about in the precincts of Government Offices in the hope ofobtaining news or interviews. While he was of opinion that theviews of the employers, as expressed by the Newspaper Proprietors&apos;Association, must prevail, he would like to be sure that the pre-warsystem would satisfy the provincial press. It m as often urged thatthe interests of the provincial press were sacrificed to the interests ofthe London press. He was of opinion that it was impossible, as atpresent advised, to adopt the proposals of the Minister of Labour,but proposed that the Home Secretary should consider especially the needs of the provincial press. Many of the provincial paperssuffered under the inconvenience that it was left to the Press Associa-fcion to decide how much of a particular message should be forwarded. The editor of an important provincial paper had told him that the Newspaper Proprietors&apos; Association did not accuratelyrepresent the feeling of the provincial papers. If there was a general opinion among the provincial press that a central issuing office was desirable, the Cabinet could then reconsider the matter.Sir James Masterton Smith pointed out that provincial news-papers having London offices could easily be provided for in any system, but that provincial papers with no London offices must inany case be provided for,.either by the news agencies or by an expensive system of telegrams.The First Lord said that when he went to the Colonial Office
the feeling of the press was very hitter that they had been starvedin regard to matters of public interest, and he had set up a PublicityRoom, with an officer in charge, which had met the difficulty, butthe case of isolated provincial papers would be a difficulty in anycase. He understood that it was not proposed that the HomeSecretary should investigate the internal arrangements of Govern-ment Departments for supplying material to the provincial papers,but should merely satisfy himself generally that the needs of theprovincial press were adequately secured.General Swinton, referring to Sir Edward Troup&apos;s remarks,jointed out that there must have been some misunderstanding, asle had on the paper with him minutes from those concerned withpublicity in the Board of Education, Home Office, and the WarOffice agreeing that-the establishment of&quot; a Central Issuing Bureaufor -communiques would be a convenience.Sir James Masterton Smith, in reply to Lord Curzon, statedthat the summoning of a conference between a Minister and repre-sentatives of the press, referred to in the penultimate paragraph ofthe Memorandum by the Minister of Labour, was a matter that could easily be arranged between the Department concerned andthe Newspaper Proprietors&apos; Association, and required no special machinery.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that what was reallyrequired was an intimation to those Departments which had notbeen in the habit of sending communications direct to the press,indicating, on the one hand, to whom copies of the communication should be sent, and, on the other, the steps which should be taken if it were desired to summon a conference between a Minister incharge of a Department and representatives of the press.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) It should be left to each Department to make its own arrangements for sending its communications to thepress.(b.) The Home Secretary should consider whether it wasnecessary to enquire further into the position of theprovincial press in this matter, and, if he thought itdesirable, should consider whether any further steps could be taken to meet their wishes.Provision of facilities forTraining disabled soldiers.2. With reference to War Cabinet 558, Minute 6, the WarCabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Minister ofMunitions (Paper G.T.-7143) regarding the handing over of theGarrison Lane factory at Birmingham to the Training Departmentof the Ministry of Labour.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that as long ago asDecember last he had taken this matter up with the Departmentsconcerned, and had pressed the Ministry of Munitions to handover the factory with its machinery for the purpose of trainingdisabled soldiers. He had obtained a promise from the Ministry ofMunitions and the Ministry of Pensions that they would send representatives to Birmingham to arrange the matter, and he hadbeen under the impression that this had been done and the factoryhanded over.Sir Howard Frank said that the fact that the Ministry ofLabour wanted this factory had only recently come to his notice.The factory had been, referred by the Munitions Council to theDisposals Board for sale, and had been advertised for two months.The local authorities were made aware that the factory was fur sale,but he had received no request that it should be reserved fortraining purposes until he heard through Mr. Currie. The tendersreceived from various firms varied from 55,000 . to 9,0O0Z. for thepurchase of the factory, which had been valued at 37,500L with
5WC 561the machinery it was proposed to sell. His contention was that theDisposals Board would be placed in a very unpleasant position if this factory were withdrawn after it had been advertised for two months.There was another factory opposite the Birmingham CorporationTraining Schools in Lench Street, which was almost as suitable asthe one in Garrison Lane, and he thought arrangements might bemade to hand over these premises to the Ministry of Labour. Withregard to the factory at Dudley, which it was suggested might befound suitable, he admitted that training disabled soldiers therepresented difficulties.Mr. Currie, of the Ministry of Labour, said that the Dudleyfactory had been examined by a technical staff and found quite impossible. Great difficulty had been experienced in getting thevarious local authorities to move in these matters, and the Birminghamauthorities felt that tliey had not been treated with much consideration,if their request for the Garrison Lane factory were refused it wouldhave a very bad ellect on other local authorities, and make theMinister of Labours position a very difficult one. It was unfortunate that those factories which Sir Howard Frank found most saleablewere the very ones which were most suited to the requirements ofthe Ministry of Labour.Sir Howard Frank stated, in reply to a question, that theGovernment possessed the right to refuse any tender withoutassigning a reason, but it was generally understood that the highestoffer would be accepted, assuming it was not less than the value.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that disabled soldiers were now walking the streets as a result of proper training schools notbeing provided. If the Garrison Lane factory were not handed overto the Ministry of Labour it was not improbable that the birmingham Committee would resign. Their action would affectother Committees, and there would be an outcry all over the countryaccusing the Government of disregarding the promises made to the disabled soldiers.The Minister of Pensions said that his Department had beencharged with the duty of providing training facilities for disabled soldiers up till the 8th January, when the Ministry of Labour under-took the work, and he did not think the latter was blameworthy for not having informed the Ministry of Munitions earlier of their requirements regarding the Garrison Lane factory. There was nodoubt that demands for training facilities were more numerous thanthey had been, and a bad effect would be produced if the Minister ofLabour&apos;s request in this matter were refused.Lord Curzon said that he sympathised with the position SirHoward Frank would be placed in if he had to refuse the tenders,but his position might lie made easier if the other factory which hadbeen mentioned as available, at Lench Street, was offered in place ofthe one in Garrison Lane. This might be the best way out of thedifficulty. aThe First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Government wasin a position from which it was impossible to extricate itself without being disagreeable to somebody. A solution must be found whichwas consistent with the principles which honourable men wouldadopt in such circumstances. It was a national necessity that theGarrison Lane factory should be used for training purposes. MostMinisters had been bombarded with letters to the effect that theGovernment was not keeping its promises regarding the training ofsoldiers, and no amount of explanation would get rid of the attackswhich would be made if the Government decided to sell the GarrisonLane factory. The only course Avas for Sir Howard Frank to explain to the firm which had put in the highest tender that circumstances had arisen which made it necessary for the Government to withdraw the factory from the market; the other factory in Lench Street could,however, be offered in its place.[826]-582 C
The War Cabinet decided (a.) To reaffirm the principle arrived at when this subject was last discussed (War Cabinet 558, Minute G), i.e., that theprovision of training facilities for disabled soldiers shouldbe regarded as having the first claim on national factories which were suitable for the purpose, provided that, when a factory was saleable, and another, for which no pur-chaser could be found, could be rendered reasonablysuitable, the Training Department should accommodateitself to the letter.(/;.) That the Minister of Munitions should withdraw the GarrisonLane factory, Birmingham, from the market, and hand it over to the Ministry of Labour.(c.) That the Minister of Munitions should offer the Lench Streetfactory, Birmingham, to the firm which had made thehighest bid for the Garrison Lane factory, and explain to the firm the reasons which had made it necessary forthe Government to withdraw the latter from the market.3. With reference to War Cabinet 552, Minute 4, the WarCabinet had before them memoranda on the general position asregards agricultural labour by the President of the Board of Agri-culture and Fisheries and the Secretary for Scotland (PapersG.T.-7153 and G.T.-7167).The President of the Board of Agriculture said that the situation had been rendered critical by the recent Army Order, under which men in agricultural companies were to be recalled for military duty.The view of his Department was set forth in the memorandum now before the Cabinet. In order to allay the apprehensions which theWar Cabinet proposal had aroused in the country, he suggested thata certain proportion of the men now on the land in agriculturalcompanies, who were in the true sense &quot;pivotal&quot; men, should beretained. He fully realised the difficulties confronting the War office at the present time, and he was sure that, if these difficulties were clearly explained to the County Executive Committees, the latter would be alive to the hardship of keeping in the army men of three or four years&apos; service who had every right now to be demobilised,and would not take an unfair advantage- of any concession made bythe War Office. There were now only about 20.000 men in agricul-tural companies, and another 9,000 who had been lent for purposesof agriculture from the other arms of the service. Broadly speaking,his proposal would involve the retention of not more than 10 percent, of the men now on the land.The Director of Organisation, in reply to a question as to why it was necessary to recall these men to the army, said that they werewanted for the following reasons : (1.) To bring up the strength of our cavalry on the Rhine,which was now almost immobilised for want of men.(2.) We were short of 200,000 men in Egypt and the Caucasus,&amp;c, as that number were entitled to be sent home,having been out since 1915 ; these were Army ServiceCorps men.(3.) Men were required to look after the graves of those whohad died in France and Flanders.The War Office was already engaged upon cutting out the less important services, and was, among other things, reducing the men employed in looking after the military stores in France, arrangements being made where possible to sell these stores on the spot. GeneralHutchinson said that lie had recently received deputations fromNorfolk and Scotland, and a provisional agreement had been arrivedat by which the Secretary of State for War undertook to permit up
[826]-582Dto 10 per cent, of the 29,000 being retained on the land, and toleave them on the land either in the Reserve or on permanent leavefrom the Army without pay or allowances, on the understandingthat this number would not be exceeded and that they would be most carefully selected by the Local Committees. In this arrangement he understood that Lord Ernie was willing to acquiesce.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he thought this was .a fair compromise. He agreed that the graves question was serious,and implied a solemn duty. He wished to point out that a gooddeal of local dissatisfaction was being caused by the fact that theWar Office were proposing to take back into the army a considerablenumber of men of a low category of health.The Director of Organisation said that such men would only beused for light duties in the army. Moreover, the men referred toin paragraph 4 of Lord Ernle&apos;s memorandum would not be includedin the 10 per cent., but tvonld be discharged as soon as enquiry hadbeen made into their cases. *The Secretary for Scotland said that he was very grateful tothe War Office for their offer to release 10 per cent. There were,however, two other important points on which he wished to lay stress. The first was, he hoped that all men in agriculturalcompanies would be left in their companies until the 23th instant.This was necessary owing to the lateness of the season. Thesecond point was that the demobilisation of men certified as &quot; pivotal &quot;before the 31st January last should be speeded up. Thousands ofthese were still due to come back to the land, and their release hadbeen promised by the War Office before the new Army System came into force.The President of the Board of Agriculture said that this latter point applied equally to England. Hitherto not more than 65 to 70per cent, of these men had been returned to the land.The Director of Organisation said that, as regards Mr. Munro&apos;second point, all be could do would be to represent it to theDirector-General of Demobilisation. So far as his recollection went,the promise was a provisional one and only guaranteed a gradualdemobilisation. He pointed out that not less than 208,000 officersand men had been demobilised for agriculture since the Armistice.As regards the release of the 10 per cent., he would, of course, haveto obtain the sanction of the Secretary of State for War to theproposal he had made that morning.The War Cabinet decided -That, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State for War,the War Office should arrange (1) for the retention on theland, either in the Reserve or on permanent leave withoutpay or allowances of not more than 10 per cent, of&quot;pivotal&quot; men still employed in agriculture, the selection of such men being made by the Boards of Agriculture inEngland and Scotland, in concert with the War Office ; (2)for the retention on the land of all the men, with theexception of the attached men, until the 28th May; and ofthe attached men for fourteen days from the receipt of aletter despatched from the War Office to Commands on the2nd May, conveying this decision (i.e., until the 17th May) ;and,To call the attention of the Secretary of State for War tothe necessity for speeding up the release of the &quot;pivotal&quot;men, whose demobilisation was sanctioned before the31st january, 1919. \
Prohibition on the 4. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandumImportation of W tjie Yood Controller on prohibition on the importation of potatoesPotatoes. /f)        n t  &quot; i ( t \(Paper G. 1.-/ ]41).The Minister of Food said that his Department was responsiblefor taking over the whole of the sound potatoes in Great britain in 1918, and the whole of the exportable surplus from Ireland. the potato crop had been a very large one, and there was a considerablesurplus beyond the quantity required for home consumption. Outletswere being found for part of the surplus in various european countries, but unless something could be done to stimulate theconsumption of home-grown potatoes, a large residue would remain at the end of the season, for which his Department would have topay. The best way of stimulating home consumption would be to prohibit the import of new potatoes from outside. Such potatoescame mainly from Spain, France, and the Canary Islands. lieunderstood, however, there was an agreement with France bv which her produce was entitled to admission into this country in spite ofany prohibition of imports. An embargo placed upon the importationof potatoes from the Canary Islands and Spain, however, would save the Exchequer not less than 250,000/. Moreover, the prohibition ofimports from Spain would tend to improve our exchange with thatcountry. He was very anxious, indeed, to relieve the Treasury sofar as possible. Since writing Ids memorandum, however, he hadbeen informed that the problem was not so simple as he hadimagined. Potatoes coining from abroad to this country were mainly raised from British seed, and to prohibit their importationwould prejudice in the future our relations with the exporting countries. He had also lately been given to understand that theSpanish Government had just placed an embargo on certain exports.Lord Curzon said that, before the Cabinet arrived at a decision,he would like to examine the question more closely from the ForeignOffice point of view. The matter, it seemed, resolved itself into a prohibition operating against Spain only. He wished also to ascertainto what extent, and for what period, we were bound by the allegedagreement with France. He further thought that the Board ofAgriculture might wish to submit a paper on the subject. He under-stood that Mr. Roberts&apos; proposals applied to this seasons props only.The President of the Board of Agriculture said that he feared that the proposed prohibition would not have a material effect in increasing the home consumption of potatoes, as the public muchpreferred the new crop.The Chancellor Of the Exchequer, referring to Mr. Roberts&apos; state-ment that the Spanish Government had recently decided to restrictexports, expressed the hope that if there was a shortage of potatoesin Spain we should do our best to export from Great Britain. Thiswould be very beneficial from the exchange point of view, and thereshould be no difficulty as regards shipping, as our vessels went con-stantly to Spain to bring back ores. He wished to enquire, however,whether the British representatives on the Supreme economic council in Paris were aware of the surplus here. It might bepossible to get rid of part of it by sending potatoes to Rournaniaand Czecbo-Slovakia, &amp;c. He would like Lord Robert Cecil to beplaced in full possession of the facts, and asked to assist if he could.The Secretary for Scotland said that the Scottish Board ofAgriculture agreed with Mr. Roberts&apos; proposals. In Scotland therewere no less than 100,000 tons of last year&apos;s potatoes surplus to requierements.Sir Auckland Geddes said that, as the result of the enquiry hehad been requested by the Prime Minister to undertake into thequestion of unemployment and state of trade, he had recommended the removal of all but a very few of the existing controls, and theBoard of Trade, of which he mras acting as President in the absenceof Sir Albert Stanley, was now giving effect to bis recommendations.For his Majesty&apos;s Government to adopt Mr. Roberts&apos; suggestion and
Naval Pay (men 5.&apos; The First Lord of the Admiralty raised the question of theonly). Admiralty proposals as to the pay and allowances of the men of theRoyal Navy and Royal Marines, and said that he wished to supple-ment a statement that he had made at the Meeting of the WarCabinet the previous Tuesday (War Cabinet 560, Minute 3). Therewere indications of a strong and bitter feeling in the Navy on thesubject, and there was a probability of serious disaffection if theBoard&apos;s proposals were not accepted. He felt it desirable to acquaint the War Cabinet with the circumstances in which theJerram Committee was constituted. His predecessor at theAdmiralty&apos; had informed the Prime Minister of the gravity of thesituation, and had told him that it was important (a) that the composition of the Committee should be strictly naval, and that other Government Departments should not be represented ; (6) thatthe Report of the Committee, when presented, should be acceptedpractically in its entirety, without reference to the effect that theadoption of its recommendations might have upon the other fightingservices. The Navy stood on a quite different footing from those services, as he could demonstrate if this were considered necessary.The above facts had been accepted by the Prime Minister. the composition of the Committee had become known to the Fleet,and unless the Committee&apos;s recommendations Avere endorsed by the Government very grave trouble would ensue, whichwould be accentuated by a certain portion of the press, whileagitators in the country would be quick to seize a favourable opportunity of fomenting discontent and unrest. There was nodoubt that the whole of the lower decks had been deeply stirred bythe action of the miners and the concessions recently made to them.In conclusion, he would urge the immediate adoption and thepromulgation of the Admiralty&apos;s proposals.Lord Curzon reminded the Cabinet that their decision had beenthat the Admiralty proposals should again be considered by the WarCabinet on the following Wednesday, after consultation between theChancellor of the Exchequer, the First.Lord of the Admiralty, andthe Secretary of State for War.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he was willing tomeet his colleagues of the Exchequer and the War Office, but noamount of discussion would admit of his receding from the positionhe had felt bound to take up, for the reasons he had given to theCabinet.(The War Cabinet took note of the First Lord&apos;s representations.)2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 1, 1919.oprohibit the import of potatoes would look like vacillation in thepolicy of the Government. He fully appreciated Mr. Roberts&apos; point,however.The War Cabinet decided that the Acting Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs should (a.) Examine the exact position in regard to this question asbetween ourselves and France ;(6.) Examine the probable position as between ourselves and spain;(c.) Acquaint Lord Robert Cecil with the Minister of Food&apos;sproposals, stating that we wished to dispose of between250,000 and 300,000 tons of surplus potatoes, and ask him if he could assist in the matter, as our representative on the Supreme Economic Council.
