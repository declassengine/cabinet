He (Lord Milner) thought thatsuch action was premature until the conclusion of the Peace Con-ference, and he had stopped the issue of the despatch. He wouldlike the matter to remain in abeyance for the present, or else have itdiscussed again by the War Cabinet.Mr. Bonar Law agreed that it would be better not to take any action until the conclusion of peace.The War Cabinet took note of the views held by the Admiralty,the War Office, the Air Ministry, the Board of Trade, and theMinistry of Shipping, as regards it being contrary to British interests to depart from the pre-war policy of placing as few restrictions aspossible on the use of British ports abroad by foreign vessels, and of inducing foreign navies and auxiliary fleets to become dependent onthese ports.The War Cabinet approved the proposal that no action shouldbe taken by the Secretary of State for the Colonies on war Cabinet decision 516, minute 7, pending the con-clusion of peace.Military, Naval,and Air ForcePensions.4. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer on Military, Naval, and AirForce Pensions (Paper G.T.-7116).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the proposal wasthat a Committee, composed of the Financial Secretary of theTreasury as Chairman, and representatives of the War Office, theAdmiralty, the Air Force, and the Pensions Ministry, should examine and report upon the schemes proposed by the different departments.Mr. Bonar Law suggested that it might be better if theMinister of Pensions were to act as Chairman to the Committee.The War Cabinet decided that A Committee should be appointed to consider the  matter,composed as follows : The Minister of Pensions (Chairman),Representatives of The Treasury.The War Office,The Admiralty,The Air Ministry,Policy ofRepatriatingRussian Prisonersof War fromGermany.5. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Note by theSecretary of State for War, on the question of repatriating russian prisoners of war from Germany, via the Western frontiers of Russia.(Paper G.T.-7I34).Mr. Bonar Law said that, while agreeing with the views expressed in the War Office Note, he was not quite clear as to what action could be taken by the War Cabinet, beyond sending the WarOffice Note to the Prime Minister and saying that the War cabinet agreed with the views expressed1.
3 . WC 559The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was strongly of opinion that it was undesirable to repatriate the prisoners. Theprinciple had, however, been accepted at Paris about a fortnightpreviously, at a meeting which had been held at Mr. Lloyd George&apos;house.The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff said thatattempts were being made to collect anti-Bolshevik prisoners. Sofar as he knew, nothing had as yet been done as regards repatriatingthe prisoners, and the War Office sincerely hoped that it would be stopped.The War Cabinet decided that  *A copy of the War Office Note should be sent to the primeMinister, with a message stating that the War Cabinetconcurred in the views expressed therein, and instructed the Acting Secretary to take the necessary action.Peace Celebrations. 6.
