The War Cabinet had under consideration : (a) A memo-randum by the Admiralty (G.T.-6448) urging the vital necessity ofadequately protecting the Mercantile Marine, and the desirability ofsecuring that merchant ships are capable of being defensively armedwithin a reasonably short period after the outbreak of hostilities,and setting forth the relative advantages and disadvantages whichwould result from the adoption of the course proposed in theMemorandum ; (b) a Memorandum on the same subject by theMinistry of Shipping stating that the Shipping Controller fullyagreed with the views expressed by the Board of the Admiralty, and recommending that the expense of the cost of the necessary stiffeningof new vessels should be borne by the shipowner as part of the costof construction ; and (c) a Memorandum by the late President of theBoard of Trade expressing the concurrence of that department in the views put forward in the above Memoranda.The First Sea Lord said that the Admiralty Memorandum hadbeen submitted with a view to laying the foundations of an after-,
war policy. That policy envisaged the possibilities of a new war,and was at once far-sighted and economical.The Minister of Shipping observed that it was not proposed todeal with existing ships, but only to make provision for the futureby ensuring that all new merchant vessels should be so constructedas to be rendered capable of being defensively armed shouldoccasion arise. It was purely a Board of Trade concern to see thatthe fittings of skips were in accordance with the orders of Govern-ment.The War Cabinet decided-(1.) That the policy recommended by the Admiralty and endorsed by the Ministry of Shipping and Board ofTrade should be adopted in principle ;(2.) That the measures necessary to give effect to that policy should be settled by the President of the Board of Tradein concert with the Minister of Shipping.Supply of Hay andGrain to theExpeditionaryForce and Army ofthe Black Sea.2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the under-Secretary of State for War on the supply of Hay and Grainto the Expeditionary Force and Army of the Black Sea (G.T.-733D,stating that owing to the failure of the supply of the local &quot; Tibben&quot;for various reasons set forth in the Memorandum, supplies of hayfor the above-mentioned Expeditionary Force could not be supplied from Egypt; and, further, that India, which had hitherto suppliedgrain to Egypt for five months in the year, was, owing to drought,unable to undertake any additional export. As regards hay to constantinople and the Black Sea ports, the requirements of which amounted to 4,000 tons per month, arrangements had been madefor this supply from various North African ports. As regards hayrequirements for Egypt, the only alternative was to provide them from England and Northern France, where certain surplus stockshad still to be cleared off. As regards grain for both Egypt andthe Black Sea ports, the only possible source of supply was England,r- 1, to a smaller extent, the north of France. The Shipping Con-troiier had been asked to allocate the necessary freight, but in viewof the fact that the quantity of shipping involved would necessitate the withdrawal of cargo vessels from other important services, hewas unable to allocate the necessary shipping wtthout specialdirection from the War Cabinet.The Shipping Controller explained about the shortness ofshipping. He said one of the principal difficulties was theshortness of coal. Ships often now take three times as long to getcoal cargoes as had formerly been the case. The effect o lowrailway rates for the transport of material was being felt in the coasting trade, and Sir Eric Geddes had informed him that, as thematter stood at present, it was not within his power to remedy this state of affairs.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said the matter had been raised afresh in a recent memorandum by Sir Norman Hill, whocalled attention to the congestion of traffic in the ports (G.T.-7333).The Acting President of the Board of Trade thought that itwould be possible for his Department to raise the rates for goodstraffic under the same powers as it possessed iu regard to passengerrates. He was going fully into the whole question, and he hopedit might be possible to raise the rate for goods traffic, which,incidentally, would appreciably relieve the Treasury.Mr. Bonar Law doubted the possibility of making any general or percentage increase in the rates, and considered that any adjust-ment must have regard to the particular nature of the traffic. Ashad been pointed out to the War Cabinet at a previous meeting,rates for transport by coast and steamer had risen enormously, andthere had been no concomitant rise in railway freights. He doubtedvery much whether it would be possible to supply oats and hay
from England, as there was a great shortage of both these commodities.The Shipping Controller pointed out that we still maintained83,000 horses in Egypt, which seemed an excessive number under present conditions. One reason for demanding so large a quantityof oats from outside was the reluctance on the part of the Egyptianfarmers to supply them, and, in his opinion, pressure should bebrought to bear upon them through the Egyptian Government.General May said that the Egyptian Government had refuseddie War Office permission to buy oats direct from Egyptianfarmers. He had interviewed General Allenby&apos;s Director of supplies at the War Office two clays previously, and the latter had said thathe was not empowered to make any arrangements in regard to localsupplies.The Shipping Controller pointed out that any extra price thatmight be paid to the Egyptian farmers would amount to far lessthan the extra cost of allocating ships from England.The War Cabinet decided That the Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs shouldrepresent to the Commander-in-Chief of the EgyptianExpeditionary Force that, owing to the impossibility ofproviding shipping, and having regard to the financialsaving that would be effected if oats were supplied, even atan excessive price, within Egypt itself, he should go intothe whole question on the spot and report at an early date as to whether oats could not be provided locally.General May said that owing to the failure of the hay crop theWar Office proposed to try and meet the requirements of the army of the Black Sea and the Egyptian Expeditionary Force by drawingupon the surplus stocks in France, and also, possibly, from england.Mr. Bonar Law suggested that the shipping for the hay mightbe diverted from the North African ports.The Shipping Controller said that, with regard to shipping, wewere getting, into a very serious position. The situation, however,might be easier in two or three months&apos; time. At present it wouldbe less difficult to provide ships from the United Kingdom than from North. Africa, He suggested that 8,000 tons of hay might besent from the United Kingdom and 4,000 tons from North Africa.To a limited extent the shortage of cargo ships might be alleviatedby making use of vacant spaces in liners.The War Cabinet decided That the requirements of hay for the next month of theEgyptian Expeditionary Force and the Army of the black sea should be met as far as practicable by drawing from thesurplus stocks in Northern France, the necessary arrange-ments being made by the Ministry of Shipping inconsultation with the War Office, and that at the end ofthat period the situation should be reviewed.Australian Lead ^&apos;        War Cabinet had under consideration a joint memo-and Copper. randum (G.T.-7354) by the President of the Board of Trade and theMinister of Munitions stating that the above Ministers had met thePrime Minister of Australia on the 20th instant, and had informed him of the terms of the arrangements which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment were prepared to make as to Australian lead and coppersupplies, as the result of a Conference of Ministers held in the leader of the House&apos;s room at the blouse of Commons on the 19thMay, 1919 (G.T.-7328). These terms involved, in the case of lead,the purchase at a fixed price of 130,000 tons of pig up to the 1stApril, 1920, and 65,000 tons in the following six months at a fixedprice of 181. per ton less 1 per cent, net f.o.b. Sydney, the British
Governmentbearing any loss on re-sale, any profit being divided equally between the British Government and the Australian producers. Asregards copper, the proposal was that the British Government shouldpurchase 25,000 tons during the next twelve months, at the price for electrolytic copper of SOL per ton,, less .1 per cent. f.o.b. Sydney,and subject to adjustment as toother qualities. On the following day Mr. Hughes, after consultation with bis trade advisers, statedthat, whilst the copper proposals were acceptable to the interestconcerned, he could not agree to the lead proposals. Mr. Hugheshad been previously informed that the copper and lead proposals must, in the opinion of the said Ministers, be taken together, andthat failure to arrive at any agreement as to lead must involve theabandonment of the copper proposals also. As it had been impossible to arrive at any arrangement which would be acceptable to both parties, the matter had been referred to the War Cabinet.After a brief discussion, the War Cabinet decided : That the Prime Minister should be informed that the two ministers deputed to negotiate with the Prime Minister ofAustralia on behalf of the War Cabinet had been unableto come to any arrangement; that the AVar cabinet had been informed by the said Ministers that in their view it was not feasible to negotiate satisfactorily on terms otherthan those set forth in the Memorandum by Lord Inverforthand Sir Auckland Geddes ; and that the W ar Cabinet was satisfied that it was not possible, in the circumstances, forthem to continue the negotiations.The Acting President of the Board of Trade, in reply to an enquiry, informed the Cabinet that owing to great pressure of workin connection with his new office to go to Paris at the present justice to discuss the matter further would seriously upset thearrangements of his Department, and accordingly he hoped he wouldnot be pressed to go.Unemployment 4. The Minister of Labour raised the question of the continuanceDonation. of the unemployment donation to demobilised soldiers, and statedthat some 9,000 disabled soldiers, who had been demobilised, were due to receive, under present arrangements, their last payment atthe end of the present week. Pie desired to point out to the WarCabinet that there would certainly be a great public outcry if itwere known that the Government intended to withdraw theunemployment bonus from disabled soldiers, and leave them only with their pension, which was quite inadequate for a decentlivelihood. At the present moment there Avere not more than about45,000 disabled men on the unemployed list, so that the continuanceof the bonus to these men would not involve any very greatexpenditure. He suggested that the bonus might be reduced from29s. to II. per week.&quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer, after referring to certainanomalies in regard to widows&apos; pensions, enquired whether theMinister of Labour was satisfied that men who were drawing theunemployed bonus were not employed because no work could befound for them, or because they preferred to continue drawing the bonus to working. There was no doubt that the country was much concerned about the continuance of the payment of unemploymentdonations to men who, it was alleged, refused to take up employ-inent when it was offered to them.The Minister of Labour said that his Department had made an exhaustive examination of all such cases as had been brought totheir notice, and had discovered that in comparatively few instancesavas there any justification for the allegation of malingering. Thefact was that at present it was exceedingly difficult to find employment for these men.
The Acting President of the Board of Trade confirmed this,and said that in many parts of the country there was no prospect ofemployment being found for a considerable time.The Minister of Pensions agreed that it was impossible for adisabled man to live on his pension ; it was only the addition of theunemployment donation that enabled him to exist. In his view, alldisabled men must be treated just as generously as the demobilised.He suggested that the unemployment donation to disabled soldiersmight be continued on a scale which should be so graduated as toleave some inducement to such men to find work.The War Cabinet decided To approve the continuance of unemployment pay on a modified and graduated scale to disabled men, and authorised the Minister of Labour to make a statement tothis effect if and when the question should be raised in Parliament.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., 1,May 28, 1919.
