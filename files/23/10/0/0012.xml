british Control ofthe Royal DutchShell PetroleumGroup. J1. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum byMr. Walter Long, as Chairman of the Petroleum Executive, uponthe heads of an agreement, which had been arrived at between LordHarcourfs Committee on Imperial Petroleum Policy and the RoyalDutch Shell Group (Piper G.T.-6961).Mr. Long said that the formal approval of the Cabinet wasrequested to the agreement, which bad been reached as the result of long discussions in the Committee under the guidance of LordHarcourt. It was expected that, as the result of the proposed arrangement, by the end of two or three years there wouldbe a considerably improved position in regard to the oil supply, andthat at the end of ten years this country would be independent of american supplies.Lord Curzon said that he desired, on behalf of the WarCabinet, to say that His Majesty&apos;s Government was very grateful toLord Harcourt for the work he had done as Chairman of theCommittee, which was of Imperial value of the highest importance.The Minister of Munitions expressed his approval of thearrangement proposed, especially as it did not bind the supply department to obtain its requirements from this particular group,but would leave the Department free to buy in the open market.Lord Harcourt desired to draw attention to one matter whichwas still outstanding. It was necessary to make some arrangement to protect the Dutch shareholders from the incidence of the Britishincome tax. The agreement, by bringing the companies under british control, might subject the Dutch shareholders to Britishincome tax, to which they were not at present liable and to whichthey would not otherwise be liable. !t, was felt that the treasury would not be giving away any revenue which they Avere nowobtaining, or Avhich they would have any light to retain. Thematter was now in negotiation with the Treasury to find a formula to meet the case. It might be necessary to ask the Treasury togive an undertaking that, if it Avas legally impossible to avoid thepayment of British income tax by the Dutch shareholders, themoney so paid would be refunded by the British Government.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Avho entered at this point,Lord Harcourt having retired, said that lie foresaw great difficultyin giving exemption from income tax to foreign shareholders whichwas not given to Dominion shareholders, and it Avas conceivable thatthe Secretary of State for the Colonies would take exception to sucha proposal.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To approve the heads of agreement between the BritishGovernment and the Royal Dutch Shell Group.(/;.) That negotiations between Lord Harcourfs Committee andthe Treasury, in relation to the exemption of the Dutchshareholders from income tax, should continue, and that,in the event of failure to arrive at agreement, thematter should again be referred to the Cabinet.Immediate future requirements in personnel of tin;Royal Air Force.2. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Note by theSecretary of State for Air, covering a Memorandum by GeneralSeely (Paper G.T.-7200), in which it was stated that it had been understood by the representatives of&apos; the Air Ministry that theCabinet had sanctioned the enrolment of 3,500 officers ontemporary engagements, in addition to the award of 1,500 permanent commisions, but that, in view of the decision of the Cabinet as recorded in War Cabinet 556, Minute 2, of the I 5th April, the requisite sanction had not, in fact, been obtained, and that it was now imperative to enrol officers to meet the requirements of theimmediate future of the Air Force.   The Memorandum also set out
the coiiditi&apos; ns of service, and rates of pay to be given to the officersin question.The Secretary of State for Air said that it was necessary torealise that the Air Force differed from the Ai-my and the Navy, inthat it had hitherto had no permanent commissioned officers, andconsequently would (all to the ground if no arrangements wt-re madeto cover the period when the engagement under which the temporary officers were serving lapsed, the only other provision being 1,500permanent commissions which had beer, sanctioned by the Cabineton 15th April. Thf-&apos; uncertainty prevailing as to the future of theAir Force miyht make it very difficult to maintain it. Officers didnot know how long t heir engagements would last, and were unableto decide upon their future careers. The best of them were driftingaway, and the remainder were in a state of dislocation and uncertainty. The quite modest propos ds contained in theMemorandum were compatible with any post-war policy in regard tothe Air Force which it was conceivable the Government would adopt.Even after the Treaty of Peace was signed, the nation would nevertolerate disbanding the Air Force. Apart from all other con-siderations, the liability of the country to attack from the air wouldmake it essential to maintain a permanent air defence force.Lord Curzon pointed out that the. vriattrr now under discussion had not been covered by the previous Cabinet decision as approvedby the Chairman, and it was necessary to consider it on its merits.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that there had not yetbeen any discussion in the Cabinet as. to the future permanentstrength of the Air Force, and he did not desire to commission alarge number of officers before the matter had been examined inits relation to the permanent strength of dm Army and the Navy.He pointed out that the Air Force could be in no immediatedifficulty, inasmuch as they had the right to retain temporary officers.The Secretary of State for Air said that it was impossible todetermine the future strength of the Army until data were available as to the extent of the liabilities we should have to undertake, andfor that reason the suggestion had been made for varying periods ofservice from one to four years, in order to make adjustments possiblein the future. While it was true that the Air Ministry had theright to retain temporary officers for the present, that right couldnot be exercised indefinitely, and provision must be made for thetime when the right to retain control of temporary officers lapsed.General Seely said that, under present conditions, they were in danger of losing the valuable officers and only retaining the inferiorones.Some discussion took place as to whether 2,000 officers wouldbe a sufficient number as a provisional arrangement to enable theAir Ministry to retain all those officers whose services theyparticularly desired to keep.General Trenchard said that, on an estimate he had made threemonths previously, 2,500 was the smallest number which wouldenable them to secure all those officers whom he desired to retain.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was prepare -ed toagree to 2,500 officers, and would sanction the rates of pay for officers proposed in the memorandum by the Air Ministry, but tookexception to the proposed gratuity of 15 per cent, of the total payearned during the period of. engagement, on the ground thatgratuity was essentially a provision for the war emergency, to compensate an officer for breaking off his civil life, and to enable himto start afresh.Admiral Lambert stated that the gratuity proposed was basedon the analogy of a gratuity given to the Royal Naval Air service before the war, at the same rate. Gratuity was well established incertain cases in the Navy for short-term engagements.
General Seely said that it would be very unusual to ask officers to come for a short term without gratuity or pension. It would bea new departure, and particularly unfortunate in this instance, owingto the high rate of fatal accidents in the Air Force, even inpeace time.The Secretary of State for Air said that it was particularlynecessary to offer a gratuity as an inducement, in view of the factthat it was impossible to offer a long career to most of the officersin the Air Force, and it would otherwise be necessary to assumesome responsibility for their future careers. Officers would beobtained from three sources- -those seconded from the army and thenavy for a short period and those engaged for the Air Force, andsome inducement must be offered to those in the last category toenter t he Air Service for so short a period.General Trenciiard pointed out that in the Royal Flying Corpsgratuity had been given before the war to officers serving for ashort period.Mr. Chamberlain said that, in view of the statements made asto the precedents of a system of gratuities in the pre-war period,be would like to consider the matter further.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To authorise 2,500 temporary commissions in the Air Force,of which 1,500 were to be for a period of four years, and1,000 for a period of not longer than three years to bea provisional arrangement pending the decision of theGovernment as to the composition of the permanentAir Force.(/).) To approve the rates of pay for officers, as set out in thememorandum by the Air Ministry, subject to an agree-ment being arrived at between the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Secretary of State for Air in regardto the gratuity it was proposed to pay each officer onthe completion of bis period of active service.Responsibility for 3. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSupply of Aircraft. Chancellor of the Exchequer (Paper G.T.-7034) enclosing memoranda by Lord Inverforth and General Seely, and a note by the Secretaryof State for War (Paper G.T.-7207) covering a Memorandum byGeneral Seely.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that some of the papersnow before the Cabinet laid stress on the urgency of the matter and pressed for an immediate decision. He wished to explain that he himself was not&apos;responsible for any delay that might have occurred in bringing his Memorandum of the 23rd March before the Cabinet.He understood that it was the wish of Mr. Bonar Law to allow thestatus quo to continue until the return of the Prime Minister.The Secretary of State for War stated that he had understood the whole matter had been settled, and he had consequently beenpreparing to arrange to make the necessary adjustments in regard toestimates and transfer of accommodation, the latter in consultationwith the Minister of Munitions. He had conferred with the PrimeMinister some weeks back on the subject, and the latter had statedthat he supposed that anything that was mutually agreed upon bythe Air Minister and the Minister of Munitions would prove acceptable to the War Cabinet. Assuming, as he had, that the matter had been settled, he had rabed no objection to the delay in discussing the Chancellors memorandum. Then he had realised that a greatuncertainty existed in regard to the matter. He wished to point outthat during the war the Aeronautical Supply Department was underthe Ministry of Munitions, but this was only a formal arrangement.When he himself had been Minister of Munitions he had given LordWeir practically a free hand to make what arrangements he liked, in
consultation with the members of the Munitions Board. Lord Weir had then been made Air Minister, and had been succeeded by Sir ArthurDuckham, who spent most of the day at the Hotel Cecil, and for all practical purposes was a member of the Air Board. In point of fact,therefore, the Aeronautical Supply Department of the Ministry ofMunitions had really been an integral part of the Air Ministry ; and,although on paper the present proposal appeared to indicate a consider-able change, this was not really the case. When he had first becomeAir Minister, he had hoped that he would not have to take over thewhole of the Aeronautical Departments dealing with supply, design,&amp;c, but only those connected with research ; and he had minutedvery strongly at the time against the proposal now before theCabinet. He had also approved the transfer of the TechnicalDepartments to the Ministry of Supply, and he had appointed astrong Committee, under the Chairmanship of Sir James Stevenson,to consider the position of Aircraft, Technical, and supply departments. This Committee included partisans of both views,but had reported unanimously that the Ministry of Supply should undertake for the Air Ministry the supply and production of allstores and of standardised aircraft supplies, and that the AirMinistry should undertake the supply and production of suchaii craft technical supplies as are not yet standardised. In face ofthe representations made by the Committee, he had altered hisopinion, and was prepared to recommend the adoption of theirReport.Sir James Stevenson said that the main fact which hadinfluenced his Committee in arriving at their conclusions was thatthe Aeronautical Branch of the Ministry of Munitions during thewar had really been a part of the Air Ministry, and might well havebeen so labelled. Design, production, and inspection were inseparable,and any attempt to dissociate them would prove impracticable in thelong run. Design changed every day, and it was necessary thatthe closest possible communication should be established between the pilots, the designers, and the producers. Cue could not divorcesupply from design without loss of efficiency and considerable friction.The only alternative to the proposals of his Committee was to takeeverything away from the Air Ministry and place it under the new ministry of Supply.General Seely pointed out that the variation in type would bemuch more considerable in ijeace than in war, more especially duringthe transitional stage, when greater elaboration in design was probable.Lord Curzon said that all the arguments which Sir JamesStevensons Committee had put forward in favour of their proposals were familiar to him, as he had himself advanced them on many occasions when he had presided over the Air Board two years before.His own views then had been overridden because the present PrimeMinister, who was at that time Minister for War, had urged that the munitions Department should undertake all aeronautical supplies,and the same line had been taken by the then Minister, Mr. Montagu.Further, Mr. Balfour, who was then First Lord of the Admiralty, hadobjected very strongly to the proposals of the Air Board. However,although nominally aeronautical supply was handed over to theMinistry of Munitions in 1916, in practice it remained with the AirBoard, and this was the proposal to which it was proposed directly to revert.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that when the aero-nautical supply was transferred to the Minister of Munitions, thework was much better done than ever before, because an end was put to the constant change of design. When the Admiralty and theWar Office had their several departments of design the various con-tractors had lodged numerous complaints regarding the great delay and expense caused. When, however, desiun was taken over by theMinistry of Munitions, the latter Department worked with the Air[826-615] C
Ministry with complete harmony and correlation of ideas. as stated in his Memorandum, he was strongly opposed to the present proposals. The existing arrangement had admittedly been a great improvement on the former system, and he could not see why itshould not continue. His views, he had reason to believe, wereshared in strong measure by Sir Eric Gedees, and also, he thought,by Mr. Montagu.The First Lord of the Admiralty declared that if those were theviews of Sir Eric Geddes be felt sure thai, they were not connectedwith his Admiralty experience. As regards the Admiralty, theywould he personal to him only, and were quite opposite to those heldby the Board of Admiralty.The Secretary of State for War thought that the only principle to be followed was that the supply of standardised articles should beleft to the Ministry of Munitions ; the design of aeroplanes was,however, a different matter, and was as much wrapped up in the life of the Air Force as battleships were wrapped up in the life of theAdmiralty.The Chancellor ol the Exchequer said that, whenever any pro-posal was made affecting the control of supply of any Department,the same objections were always put forward, and, in the event, were found to be without foundation.The Minister of Munitions said that when he first discussed thematter with the present Air Minister, they had found themselves oncommon ground. Then had come the appointment of Sir JamesStevensons Committee, and he had to confess that, after reading theCommittee&apos;s report, be had changed his views.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, whatever thedecision of the Cabinet might be, he desired to assure them that theBoard of Admiralty had held very strong views on the subject, andthat these views were shared by every member of the Board. he did not admit the contention of the Chancellor that objections raised to the transfer of control were mere &quot;Lgeys.&quot;The Chief of the Air Staff stated that all his experience went toshow that design must remain with the Air Ministry so long as itvaried almost daily.The Chancellor of the Exchequer interposed to say that thepoint of difference between himself and his colleagues was not designbut manufacture.The Chief of the Air Staff said that, in regard to this, his views were entirely in accord with those held by the Air Minister.Lord Curzon said that he felt the general sense of those present was in favour of adopting the recommendations of Sir JamesStevensoifs Committee. He suggested, therefore, that the WarCabinet might decide accordingly, subject to the ratification of thisdecision by the Prime Minister, who was one of the strongestoriginal supporters of the opposite side; and, if he dissented fromthis decision, be could brine: the matter before the Cabinet again onIns return from Paris.The War Cabinet decided To approve, subject to the Prime -Ministers ratification, therecommendations of Sir James Stevensons Committee.[The GJiancettor of the Exchequer desired that his dissent fromhh is decision slioxdd be recorded.)4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theChairman of the War Cabinet Committee on Accommodation,relating to the evacuation of the Hotel Cecil (Paper G.T.-7208).The memorandum stated that it was hoped that the settlement by the War Cabinet of the absorption by the Air Ministry of theAircraft Production and Aeronautical Inspection Department would
Prices of Coal 5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thesupplied to Allies.     Acting President of the Board of Trade, relating to the prices ofcoal supplied to the Allies (Paper G.T.-7180).The Memorandum stated that the Coal Controller was of opinionthat the time had arrived when the limited prices charged for british coal to Allied countries should be withdrawn. It stated that theFrench State railways, worked on behalf of the French Government,in the distribution of coal had made a, profit on the sale of coal up tothe 30th January last of approximately 35,000,0O0LThe War Cabinet decided that The limited prices charged for British coal to the Allied countries mentioned in the Memorandum by the Acting President ofthe Board of Trade (Paper G-T.-7180) should be withdrawnforthwith.6. With reference to War Cabinet 561, Minute 5, the First Lordof the Admiralty said that, during the previous discussion on theReport of the Jerram Committee, he had not realised how far matters had gone in the December and January negotiations. The suggestion of appointing the Jerram Committee was first raised in December bySir Eric Geddes, in consequence of the grave reports which had beenreceived as to the condition of the Fleet since the Armistice. two days ago he (the First Lord) had received such serious reportsregarding the Fleet that he had telephoned to the Prime Ministeryesterday morning. The Prime Minister had been so overburdenedwith affairs in Paris that it had been impossible for him to go intothe matter. The Prime Minister had intimated to the First Lord,however, that he was prepared to accept any settlement arrived at by the Cabinet. The First Lord, continuing, said that Sir eric geddes retired on the 11th December, 1918, and for a short inter-regnum there had been no First Lord, and the First Sea Lord hadacted in his stead. There was no doubt that the serious condition ofthe Fleet was made known-to \ the Cabinet during December. Theposition was that the Navy had not received anything like the increases of pay during the war which the civilian worker hadreceived, and, in consequence, it had been decided to appoint a purely Naval Committee .to go into the question.   The fact that naval Pay (menonly).not delay the rearrangement of accommodation, necessary for ensuring the evacuation of the Hotel Cecil at the earliest possible moment.The Secretary of State for War said that he was all in favourof the evacuation of the Hotel Cecil at the earliest possible moment,and the taking over of the new premises suggested by the first commissioner of Works as soon as possible. He understood,however, that the new premises proposed were not yet ready.The First Commissioner of Works stated that the new premisesfor the use of the Air Ministry would, he hoped, be ready in amonth&apos;s time.The Under-Secretary of State for Air Maid that he must protest against a fighting service having its offices at the other end of theStrand, and he was of opinion that offices in this neighbourhoodwould greatly hamper the staff in its duties.The Secretary of State for War said that he would undertakethat the evacuation of the Hotel Cecil by the Air Ministry wouldtake place within a montlfs time, and that, provided the newpremises were ready, the Air Ministry would be in occupation ofthem by the end of June.The War Cabinet, on the Secretary of State for War&apos;sassurance, decided that  &apos;The Air Ministry should vacate the Hotel Cecil by the endof June.
this Committee had been appointed was universally known, andthe officers in the Navy were in sympathy with the demandsof the lower deck. There was no doubt that the lower deckwas in a serious condition, and trouble occurred on some ships,and it would he said that the War Cabinet, before whom thematter had been brought during December, would be breakingtheir word if the concessions now asked were not granted tothem. The immediate settlement of this question was now of thegreatest importance, and lie thought that if this settlement was delayed over the week-end it would be at the gravest possible risk.The First Lord said that he gave this warning because, in the event of trouble and nothing having been settled, he was afraid that he wouldhave to state in public that he had warned the War Cabinet of theconsequences of delayed action. If, however, an acceptance of theJerram Committee&apos;s Report were announced by the followingSaturday he thought affairs would calm down. The First Lordadded that he had omitted to state the other day, when this matter had come up for discussion, that, regarding the 4s. a day pay to the younger men, the Admiralty did not propose to give this sum to the short-service men, to whom it was proposed to give 3s. 6c/.The Secretary of State for War said that the following Sundaywas the 11th May, i.e., six months after the Armistice. It waspossible that on this day soldiers might march out of camp and discardtheir uniforms. He had received information from the Adjutant-General as to the conditions in France, at the Curragh, KemptonPark, Winchester, and other centres, to the effect that the men might possibly demobilise themselves. The &quot; Daily Herald &quot; had fosteredthis campaign amongst the men, and the leaders who had been working the affair up had been to see General Childs and confessedto him that they were frightened at the turn events had taken. as for himself, although affairs were grave, he thought nothinguntoward would happen. The commands had been notified and steps taken to meet any great outbreak that might occur.The War Cabinet took note of the remarks of the First Lord ofAdmiralty and Secretary of State for War.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 8, 1919.o
