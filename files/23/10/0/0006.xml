With reference to War Cabinet 553, Minute 3, the WarCabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Home Secretary(Paper G.T.-7110).The Home Secretary said that his Committee had come to theconclusion that the only cause for maintaining the censorship wasthe blockade. The censorship would cease at the end of the month,but he had arranged with Sir Edward Cook to keep a nucleus staffin case it became necessary to continue the censorship. He had always thought that the War Office had control over the wirelesspress censor, but Lord William Percy had informed him that thiswas not the case. He considered that this was an important point,because we received important messages through this source. Inreply to a suggestion that the messages could go straight to theHome Office, the Home Secretary said that this might be done, buthe was not sure if they had the necessary power to secure this.Lord Robert Cecil said that the Americans had been pressing the   Supreme Economic Council  to   abolish or withdraw traderestrictions  as  far  as possible.   He referred  to a Conference,.[826^-545   ,. B
presided over by Mr. Harmsworth, beld at the Foreign Office on the14th April, at which the general questions of the censorship, andcertain, proposals made by the United States Government for modifying the censorship policy, were discussed. The proposals were as follows : (1.) That all telegraphic and cable censorship of messagespassing between the four associated countries, UnitedStates, Great Britain, France, and Italy, be abolished&quot;(the original date proposed was the 15th April, but thishas been postponed).(2.) That all telegraphic and cable censorship of messagespassing between any of the above-mentioned associatedcountries and Central and South America and Cuba be abolished.(3.) That all telegraphic and cable censorship of messagespassing between any of the above-mentioned associatedcountries and the Orient via the Pacific, except messages to and from Vladivostock, shall cease.(4.) That all cables to or from Greece, Spain, Portugal, Norway,Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Switzerland, and Belgiumshall be censored by the Associated Government in whose jurisdiction the message shall originate orterminate, and shall be subjected to no othercensorship.(5.) That all cables to or from Czecho-Slovakia, Jugo-Slavia,Roumania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Finland, Esthonia, and poland shall be censored by the Associated Governmentin whose jurisdiction the message shall originate orterminate, and shall be subjected to no othercensorship.As regards the first proposal, he was in favour of abolishing the censorship as far as the four associated countries were concerned. He also supported the second proposal to abolish the censorship between America and South America. At present hewas against proposal No. 3. As regards proposal No. 4, he was infavour of certain modifications as between themselves and the allied countries in Europe. He considered that the blockade was the onlyjustification for the censorship. He agreed that to abolish the censorship would be to diminish, but not entirely destroy, the effectiveness of the blockade. What was now operating more than any blockade was the impossibility of Germany obtaining materialsbecause she could not pay for them. . Relaxation, in his view,increased our power and did not diminish it. He attributed the holding of Vienna to the relaxations we had made, and they hadhelped us in dealing with Hungary. It would be a great mistake,he thought, to quarrel with the Americans by refusing them theirrequests in this matter.Mr. Harmsworth said he was much impressed by Lord robert cecil&apos;s arguments, and he agreed that it would be bad policy toquarrel with the Americans. We were nearing the end of theperiod of blockade. We had proceeded on the line of relaxation;it had been difficult, but the principle of making concessions to the americans, without, destroying the machinery, had been adopted.The relaxations no doubt weakened our control of the black lists.The Chief of the Imperial&apos; General Staff said that we were still at war with Germany, and that, for all we could tell, we might be.,at active war with them again. It was a mistake, therefore,&apos; hethought, to throw away such a powerful weapon as the blockade.He would agree to raising the curtain of the blockade, but not toabolishing it.Lord Robert Cecil said that the Americans, he understood,would be ready to reimpose the blockade, if necessity to bring
pressure on. Germany arose, and that could be , made a condition ofthe arrangement.Lord William Percy and Lord Arthur Browne offered strong objections to the American proposals.The First Lord of the Admiralty said he regarded the censor-ship as of vital consequence. He had not seen the american proposals, and he did not think his advisers had considered them.He could not, therefore, give his assent to them without further examination.Sir Auckland Geddes said that the blockade was literallystrangling British trade, and its removal was of urgent importance.It was impossible to get into touch rapidly with the markets.Lord Robert Cecil said he was most anxious to have a favourablereply to take back to the Supreme Economic Council, and he didnot see how he could delay giving an answer any longer.It was decided that The Cabinet were in favour of the general principle ofrelaxation of trade restrictions, other than censorship, and approved Lord Bobert Cecil taking such action as hethought fit to that end in the Supreme Economic Council,subject to the approval of the Prime Minister.Food and other supplies for allied and enemy countries.2. The War Cabinet took note of a &apos; Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War, covering a Memorandum by the Quarter-master-General on the organisation of food and other supplies for allied and enemy countries (Paper G.T.-7109).Coal IndustryCommission.Interim SankeyReport.3. With reference to War Cabinet 548, Minute 1, the WarCabinet had under consideration a Memorandum from the Board ofTrade (Paper G.T.-7121)on the Interim Report of the Coal IndustryCommission.Mr. Bonar Law said that the Memorandum only indicated thepossible alternative courses of action, and that it was impossible forthe Cabinet to come to ,a decision in the matter until Sir auckland geddes and the Home Secretary had submitted their recommendations as to the policy the Government should pursue.Sir Auckland Geddes said that he was of opinion that theactual policy which had been followed was leading them straight tonationalisation.The War Cabinet requested The Acting President of the Board of Trade, the HomeSecretary, and the Minister of Labour to prepare a series of recommendations of policy on the Report of the coal commission, for the consideration of the War Cabinet.Financing of Tradewith Eastern. Europe.[826]-5&apos;454. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandum from the Board of Trade on the financing of trade with eastern europe (Paper G.T.-7112).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had put aproposal before the Prime Minister and the War Cabinet on theprevious day which would make provision for financing trade, notonly in Eastern Europe, but all over the world.Sir Auckland Geddes said that it was necessary to make provision for immediate requirements, as indicated in theMemorandum.Mr. Chamberlain enquired exactly what was contemplated.He was prepared to discuss a scheme of insurance if definite proposals were put forward, but he was not prepared to openjj ageneral Government credit in support of trade.   It was possibleltoB 2
insure bankers against loss, but the opening of a Government creditwould entail more Government borrowing, to which he could not agree. The objection to a Government guarantee was that it tookaway the incentive to private firms to make the best bargain possible,and, whenever it was proposed to support our trade with a particularconntry, if an agreement were made with a consortium of merchantswith a foreign Government behind it, it would really amount toguaranteeing a new loan to the foreign country in question. In somecases the corruption of officials and improper influence would be inevitable.Mr. Bonar Law said that he entirely agreed with the Chancellorof the Exchequer, but the present proposal was that a gradualsystem should be introduced as between a certain number ofexporters and a certain number of importers. He suggested thatthe Cabinet should approve the proposal of a system to restartexport trade in Eastern Europe, even should it cost a certain amountof money, subject to the approval of the Treasury of each transactionor series of transactions.Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland said that the banks would not assistwithout a certain amount of Government support. On the otherhand, it was not proposed that the Treasury should give a big blockcredit with all the risks attached to it.Sir Auckland Geddes said that the Board of Trade merelywanted to know whether the British Government were prepared toaccept certain risks, in approved forms, in order to help british trade.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would agree tothat, but he particularly requested that the Board of Trade shouldbe on their guard to prevent &quot;pickings &quot; by Government officials incertain of the smaller European States.The War Cabinet decided  ,To approve the proposal of the Board of Trade that assistance should be given to the export trade with Eastern Europe,- subject to the1 approval of the Treasury of the form of transaction involved, in each case.The Spelter . 5. The War. Cabinet had under consideration a MemorandumIndustry in the by the Board of Trade on the Spelter Industry in the UnitedUnited Kingdom.     Kingdom (Paper G.T.-7113).The Memorandum referred to the arrangements made by theMinistry of Munitions for the financial assistance of zinc smelting,by which, under an agreement entered into in 1918, the Ministry ofMunitions took the whole output of British spelter makers at 56Z.per ton, plus the increased cost of labour and fuel since the date ofthe agreement, it being estimated that on those terms the smelterswould make no profit and incur no loss. This arrangement involved the Government in heavy ldss, since the Ministry of Munitions paid from 561. to 60L per ton for spelter, which could be obtained in theUnited States for about 451. per ton, the reason for the agreement being that it was very desirable to maintain this trade in the -United Kingdom.The War Cabinet decided that-The arrangement made by the Ministry of Munitions should becontinued for a-further period of six months.
Provision of facilities forTraining disabled soldiers.6. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Minister of Labour relating to the provision of facilities fortraining disabled soldiers (Paper G.T.-7105), together with aMemorandum by the Minister of Pensions (Paper G.T.-7119) anda Memorandum by  the  Chancellor  of  the   Exchequer   (paper the Memorandum by the Minister of Labour stated that theMinistry were relying upon the national factories being put at their disposal for the purpose of training establishments. On the onehand; it would involve great delay and still greater expense for theGovernment to erect special factories for the purpose. On the otherhand, where factories were saleable, the district would lose anopportunity of increased employment. It was thought, however,to be more urgent and important to provide training facilities for disabled soldiers than even to increase the number of workingfactories.In the Midlands, the good faith of the Government in the matterof providing for disabled soldiers was at stake, and it was necessaryto demonstrate that effective action was really intended. The caseof a factory at Garrison Lane, Birmingham, had arisen for immediate decision. The factory was considered to be indispensable to thetraining scheme of the Local Pensions Committee. There was noother factory available in the neighbourhood, except at Dudley in aninaccessible position on the top of a hill. The Minister of Supply,on the other hand, had a purchaser in view who was prepared topay more for the Garrison Lane factory than it had cost. In thecircumstances, it was urged that the Garrison Lane factory shouldbe handed over to the training department of the Ministry of Labour..The War Cabinet decided that  i(a.) The Garrison Lane factory should be handed over to thetraining department of the Ministry of Labour.(6.) The provision of training facilities for disabled soldiersshould be regarded as having the first claim on national factories which are suitable for the purpose, provided that,where a factory is saleable, and another, for which no pur-chaser can be found, can be rendered reasonably suitable,the training department must accommodate itself in thelatter.G.T.-7114).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1April 17, 1919.o
