*5 9 3tS    (i1. THE PRIME MINISTER, in the absence of theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs who wasindisposed, read a statement prepared in the ForeignOffice outlining recent developments in connectionwith the recognition of General Franco&apos;s Governmentin Spain.     This statement is appended to these conclusions as Annex A.The Prime Minister reminded the Cabinet that,at the previous Meeting, the Foreign Secretary had informed his colleagues that a telegram had been dispatched to our Ambassador in Paris, indicating that we wished to announce our recognition of general franco at the earliest possible moment, and in anycase not later than the 24th February, and that we hoped that the French would agree to this course and would make a simultaneous announcement.     TheFrench had replied that they were not prepared torecognise General Franco by 24th February, and theyhad asked us to agree to postpone recognition, andthe announcement thereof, until the 27th February.We had acquiesced in this proposal, whereuponM. Daladier, on the 24th February, had allowed apublic announcement of our intentions to be made.This had caused us some embarrassment;   but he (thePrime Minister) had thought it better not to disclose the above facts.In reply to a question, the Prime Minister said ithat the United States Government had not yetrecognised General Franco, but were watching theposition.     It seemed as though the fighting in Spain
*&quot;!) Oi p*do was practically over, and it was to be hoped thatGeneral Franco would now be careful to avoidaction which might offend the opinion of thecivilised world.     At the same time it had to beremembered that there were a number of very dangerous criminals who had committed acts ofgreat brutality, and it was,  therefore, too muchto expect General Franco to proclaim a generalamnesty.With regard to the Italian and German troopsin Spain, there was no recent information.     ThePrime Minister thought that nothing would be moreconducive to the early return of the Italian troops to Italy than a cessation of continual discussions as to the probable date of their departure.The Cabinet took note of the above.

THE PRIME MINISTER reminded the Cabinet thatour proposal for Staff Conversations with the french had been communicated to the French on the 4thFebruary,,   He then read a note by the Foreign Officeexplaining that the French   had now agreed toConversations on the basis suggesteds and referring to various points of procedure.    This note is appended to these Conclusions as Annex B.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE saidthat he was puzzled by the statement in* the ForeignOffice Note that on his advice it had been decided t6omit the proposal that the first stage of the Convertsations should be opened by giving the French a Papershowing in broad outline the strategical position asseen from London.   He had in fact given no such advice.    On the previous day the Sub-Committee Ofthe Defence Plans (Policy) Committee had discussed this point9 and it had been suggested that the joint planning Committee should prepare a memorandum setting out our case, and   should send it to theFrench Staff representatives, who would thus havean opportunity of examining the Memorandum and of sending a reply before the Oonversations started.The Sub-Committee thought that this course should beadopted.    This procedure had the further advantage thatit enabled us to take the initiative., and might avoidour being faced with a series of French proposals withwhich we were not in agreement.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence saidthat the Committee had invited him to mention thismatter to the cabinet with a view to obtaininggeneral approval of the course proposed.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he favoured action-3-
Italy andGermany5Communica-tion.  tothe UnitedStates.(previous reference:Cabinet 8(39), Con-clusion 2).on these lines.The Cabinet approved this proposal,THE PRIME MINISTER reminded his colleagues that,at the Meeting referred to in the margin, the Secretary   ,of State for Foreign Affairs had read a telegram receivedthe previous day from the 3ritish Ambassador at Washington(telegram No. 76) reporting a conversation which he had had on the 20th February with the Under-Secretary of state at Washington, who had received from the French GeneralStaff information of a disquieting nature as to German-f.r.to(3g)i-italian military activities.     The Foreign Secretary hadashed him to read to the Cabinet a confidential telegram which had been despatched to Sir Ronald Lindsay (No. 95)summarising our i^resent information regarding the varioussubjects dealt with in telegram No, 76.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS saidthat, as this telegram had not been distributed, liewould be glad if special arrangements could be made so as to ensure that the information in it was madeavailable for use in the preparation of.the periodicresumes which were telegraphed to the Dominions every,three or four days.The Cabinet tool: note of the telegram read by thePrime Minister.
ej     oel o 0he Londononferences.previous reference:Cabinet 8(39)Conclusion 5)3. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES saidthat the Committee which had been set up to examine theMcMahon-Hussein correspondence was still continuing itslabours under the Chairmanship of the Lord Chancellor.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that the correspondencein question was extremely unsatisfactory.    He thoughtthat, subject to one point to which he would referlater, it was very difficult to contend that the letterof the 24th October, 1915, contained any specific ex-clusion of Palestine.   At the same time, he thought itwould be very undesirable to abandon the view which wehad maintained consistently for 20 years, more especially since the Arabs were suspicious people and appeared to regard all our actions as dishonest.The argument to v/hich he referred was that theletter did exclude from the territories which were thesubject of the pledge given to the Arabs those terri-tories in regard to which the Prench had made a claim,and there was no doubt that Palestine did at that timeform part of Syria.   It was, therefore, possible forus to maintain that, since we had reserved territoriesclaimed by the French, we had not given any undertaking in 1915 to the Arabs in regard to Palestine.   The Arabreply to this view  was that, since the French claimto Palestine had not been upheld, it followed that tfreArab claim to Palestine held good.The Lord Chancellor thought there were twoanswers to this argument:    first, that it did not by.any means follow that, if the French relinquished their claim to Palestine, the Arab claim to Palestine wasthereby established.    Second, that the French hadrelinquished their claim to Palestine in favour of theestablishment of a Mandate over that territory and that,if the Mandate were abandoned, the French might claim that they had certain interests which must be safeguarded. -5-
e).; tiltilThe Lord Chancellor said that it was quite certainthat our representatives in the 1915 discussions were of theopinion that they were not giving the Arabs any undertaking in regard to Palestine.     It was not, however, quite clear whether our representatives thought that they had explicitlyi*eserved Palestine or whether they had thought that palestine was outside the scope of the discussions.Some discussion then took place on the translation of the 1910 correspondence.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that the new translationdid not really affect the matter with the exception of the single word vilayet, v/hich in Turkish meant administrativedistrict but in Arabic was interpreted in a wider sense.Tp SECRETARY OF STATE Pop v/HE OOLOPI^S then gave an account of the progress of the main negotiations.     Thediscussions had tended to centre on the constitutionalissue.     As he had told the Cabinet the previous wee:&apos;;, thePalestine Arabs had pressed for the immediate recognition ofan independent Arab State.     We had rejected the demand for recognition, o  an Arab State and for immedilate, recognition,but we had said v/e were prepared to reoogm.se an independentPalestine State in due course.The rep-representatives of the neighbouring Arab states had become more and more insistent on some action being taken at once which/-in form, would meet the demand for in-dependence.     They had taken the view that, if v/e net the  claim for independence, it would be possibleto reach agreement on immigration and land sales.They had pressed for the setting up of a provisionalGovernment on the Iraq model, under which Palestine
Ministers would nominally take over control of departments, with British advisers to run the show.We had rejected this claim for the establishmentof .a provisional Government.     At the same time, theForeign Office had been anxious that we should take action which would satisfy the neighbouring arab states^and, after consultation with the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, certain proposals had beensubmitted to the Cabinet Committee on Palestine whichwere summarised on pages 4-7 of CP. 56 (39).      Verybriefly these proposals were as follows:-(l)    The British Government should declare thatit was their intention that the Mandatec^-* should/come to an end and that anindependent Palestine State should be created in treaty relations with GreatBritain.(2)    That a Round Table Conference should be summoned to work out the Constitution ofthe proposed Palestine State and the termsof the proposed treaty with Great Britain-This Round Table Conference would, have toconsider -(a) the transitional period;(b) provisions for the unique character ofPalestine as a holy land sac-red to three religions;(c) safeguards for various communities in Palestine, especially for theJewish National HomeD       This was not an ordinary, but an extraordinary,minority, which required extraordinarysafeguards;(d) safeguards for the protection ofBritish interests, e.g. our important military interests;(e) United States interests, e.g. missions..(3)   As an earnest of our good intentions, andthe impending inaugur ation   of the RoundTable Conference, representatives of theArab and Jewish communities in palestine should be added to the Executive and advisory Councils,
THE  SECRETARY OE STATE EOR THE colonies said he had put these proposals before the delegations.       The Jews had objected to manyof the proposals, but nevertheless the discussions with them had at first gone quite well, and wehad been able to make it clear that we couldmeet many of their objections.      That had beenthe position late on Saturday night.     Over the&apos;week-end, there had been a leakage of information in Egypt where a summary of our proposals^in &quot;ccvery misleading/S&amp;tasii had been published.     Theresult had been disastrous, and there hadbeen great Arab demonstrations of joy inPalestine, followed by Jewish anger which hadtaken the form of bombing reprisals.     great pressure had been put on the jewish representatives to leave the Conference, -withthe result that conversations, with them had been broken off. He had, however,succeeded in getting them to continue discussions on an informal basis.
The Jews complained, in the first place, thatthere was no mention in our proposals of the balfour declaration or of the Mandate.    The answer to thiswas that our proposals took these matters for granted,,and dealt only with suggestions for the future.The second objection raised by the Jews hadbeen that it was quite impossible for them to acceptthe suggestion of an independent Palestine Stateuntil they knew what the safeguards would be.    Itwas not enough to say that the safeguardswould be worked out at the Round Table Conference.To meet this point of view, various alternativesafeguards which might be adopted had been worked out and submitted to Dr0 Weizmann, who appeared to be fairly well satisfaction sfied with them.    It appeared,however, that Dr. Weizmann was having greatdifficulty with his own supporters, notably withMr. Ben-Gurion, the leader of the Palestine Jews.There was still a risk that the Jews might break offnegotiations after tomorrow.    He thought, however,that Dr. Weizmann would be ready to continue discussions, subject to the reservations indicated above.In the case of the Arabs, the neighbouring arab States had accepted the proposals, and were doing their best to get the Palestine Arabs toaccept them. . Indeed,, of the Palestine Arabs, therepresentatives of the Defence Party and two representatives of the Mufti&apos;s Party were in favourof acceptance.    The rest of the delegates were still
9/j 9d5dhankering after an independent Arab State on the Iraqmodel, with a transitional period of no more than three years,,    It had now been decided to set up a smaller Commmttee on Policy to consider in detailour proposals and those of the Palestine Arabs.    Onthis Committee we should have the/support of therepresentatives of the neighbouring Arab States.As to immigration and land sales thesereally depended on the settlement of theconstitutional question.    The proposal which we had made to the Arabs had been that there should be a five years&apos; programme of, say, 100,000 immigrants,leaving the position at the end indeterminate.    Itwas proposed to settle at the Round Table Conferencewhat machinery should be used to determine immigrationat the end of that period.    The neighbouring arab states were favourably disposed to us in this matter,and they were pressing the Palestine Arabs toaccept a solution on these lines, though with perhaps a reduced total of 50,000 or 60-,000 immigrantsin the next five years.On land sales the proposal was that the HighCommissioner should have power to prohibit entirely orto restrict land sales, according to the area con-cerned.     The Arabs were asking for completeprohibition.Although the Conferences had reached a verydifficult stage, the Secretary of State thought   that,&quot;/Lau-c   (- 7&amp;*-c 6jcl s stiff a. feU^-Js h-aft- S]-as he wao still hoping&quot;fro roaeh^an agreement, it was worth while to continue negotiations for some daysfurther.    If, at the end of that time, the possibili-ties of agreement had been exhausted, the Conferences
should be brought to an end,    This, however, would onlybe done after there had been close consultation withthe representatives of the neighbouring Arab states as to the proposals which we should put forward on ourown responsibility.    We hoped that we should obtain their sympathy for these proposals, though not, perhaps,their open supports    The neighbouring Arab States might,however, come out with a declaration of their own thatthey hoped that strife would cease and that the Arabswould be content^/with the concessions which they had obtained.In conclusion, the Secretary of State forthe Colonies asked the Cabinet to give their general approval to the suggestions outlined above.    Hethought that these proposals represented an equitablesolution and it was still just possible that, onthe basis of their proposals, we might be able toreach an agreement with the representatives of bothJews and Arabs.    If, however, agreement did not result, our position2 though no doubt difficult,would be honourable.    Indeed it would in some waysbe a strong one which could be defended in Parliament.In reply to the Secretary of State forIndia, THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE colonies said that he had informed the Jewish representativesof the proposal that we should make a public declaration that in our view the balfour declaration did not mean the establishmentof a Jewish State in Palestine.    He thought that
$ 4 fe?     IPfor some time they had heen reconciled to this.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS thoughtthat the position of the Jewish representatives was houndto be difficult, so long as no precise safeguards hadbeen elaborated.     He asked if it was possible, eitherto expedite the Round Table Conference, or to proceed atonce to negotiate with regard to safeguards, therebycutting out the proposed Round Table Conference.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES saidthat he appreciated the need for making progress onthe question of safeguards, and for that reason we had set out what seemed to us to be the various possible alternatives.     He thought, however, that it would bevery risky to have a Round Table Conference without adequate preparation.     He wished himself id visit the neighbouring Arab States, and it was proposed that dr. Weizmann should visit Ibn Saud.     The preparationmight take as long as six months.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs referred to the discussion which had taken place inthe Palestine Committee on the word &quot;independent&quot;.     HeJhoped that any declaration which we made, would make quiteoJLear the limitations which would be imposed on theso-called independent Palestine State.     Otherwise weshould be sowing trouble for the future.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA pointed outthat the High Commissioner preferred the use of theword &quot;autonomous&quot; rather than &quot;independent&quot;, to whichTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES replied that theword &quot;independent&quot; had a psychological value in thenegotiations.
THE LORD CHANCELLOR expressed the fear that theArabs would use any promise of an independent State asa basis for accusations of bad faith in the future.     Hethought that it was important that we should make itclear that we favoured the establishment of an independentPalestine State when the conditions were ripe, and not within any specified period.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES con-firmed that this was the intention.As regards our Defence requirements, he did notthink that we were likely to encounter much difficulty.On the proposal of the Prime Minister, theCabinet agreedto give general approval to tbe proposals outlined by the Secretary of State for theColonies in the Minutes of the Meeting ofthe Palestine Committee held on 23rdFebruary, 1939 (CP. 56(39)) and in the       &apos;course of discussion.
SUPPLY ORGAN-ISATION INPEACE AND WAR.(previous reference:Cabinet 5(39), Con-conclusion 7. )4. The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda by the former Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence on the subject of Supply organisation in Peace and War:-(l) C.Pc-240 (38), which had receivedconsideration at the Meeting heldon 31st October, 1938 (Cabinet 51(38), Conclusion 2):(2) CP.-23 (39), covering an Extract fromthe draft Minutes of the 345th Meetingof the Committee of Imperial Defence(Minute 1),  and C.I.D- Paper No, 1505-B:(3) C.P.-33 (39), which set forth arguments in favour of and against the establish-ment of a Ministry of Supply in peace:together with(4) A Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence and the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster  (cp-48 (39)),at the end of which the Ministers summar-ised their recommendations as follows:-(i) A Ministry of Supply should not beset up in peace.(ii) All preparations should be made atonce for the setting up of a Ministryof Supply in time of war.      Thesecomprise the lay-out of the organisa-tion,  the earmarking of personnel andthe detailing of Branches which wouldbe transferred to the Ministry.These preparations should be central-ised in the Chairman of the SupplyBoard, who would be supplied with aspecial staff for the purpose.     any questions needing Ministerial decisions would be referred by him to a committeeof the Ministers concerned.(iii) A decision whether, and, if so, when,a Ministry of Supply would be set upin war should be deferred until theonset of an emergency.(iv) The Ministry of Supply should beresponsible for supply for the WarOffice and the Air Ministry, but not .for the Admiralty unless and untilthe stresses of war compel its inclusion;    suitable safeguards forthe &quot;user&quot; must be enforced.
(v) The Ministry of Supply should, he responsible only for those parts ofSupply which call for extensivediversion of the engineering, chemicaland metallurgical industries fromtheir normal spheres.(vi) The supply of common stores should bearranged by Departments under theexisting system, with a suitableCommittee,  such as the ContractsCo-ordinating Committee, forco-ordination.(vii) The functions of design and research,and of inspection, should be transferredas well as the functions of supply.(viii) Compulsory powers for the Ministryover labour are not practicable.A Memorandum by the Minister of Labour was attached as an Appendix, in which it waspointed out that a wide field of essential work existed which could be done by aMinistry of Supply in peace-time withoutrecourse to compulsory powers regardinglabour.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCE saidthat the Paper necessarily covered old ground, butthat he and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterhad built largely on the work of his predecessor, theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs.     He had tried to reach a reasonable solution of a problem which was bound to be controversial.The Minister then went through the Memorandumparagraph by paragraph, and called attention to the salient points.He felt some difficulty in adjudicating upon which departments should be included within a Ministry ofSupply, since his Admiralty experience led him to attach great importance to the difficulties ofseparating the design and production branches of the
Admiralty from the staff or user branches, withwhich they were so closely interlocked.      TheMinister referred to the organisation in the UnitedStates of America, where the Under-Secretary ofState for War was.responsible for all supply matters for all three Services, with the exception of warships, which remained a Navy responsibility.It was however possible that, although the Admiraltydid not now contemplate any large extension of their production after the outbreak of war, circumstances might arise which would necessitate such an expansion.With regard to paragraph 16,  the Ministeremphasised that the personnel of the service departments were now accustomed, much more than inthe late War, to close co-operation, and he thoughtthat disputes on minor matters could be settledquite easily interdepartmentally.      On the otherhand, the really big issues which involved policy would necessarily have to be settled by the Cabinet.Some discussion then took place on thestatement in paragraph 20 that it would be impossibleto enforce Compulsory powers over labour in thepolitical conditions of this country.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that hewas not in agreement with this-statement.     Hethought that it would be doubtful policy to introduce a Bill with compulsory powers   over     industry, butnot   over     labour.      Further, even if there were difficulties in applying compulsory powers to labour,there was a good deal to be said for having the powers in reserve.     Moreover, the position in the next war would be wholly different from that in the last war..
He contemplated that there woU^d be conscription fromthe. outset, and that the force of public opinion,together with the effect of air raids, would resultin a wholly different outlook.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCE andTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER explainedthat this paragraph was based on information whichhad been given to them.      They understood that the attempt to apply compulsory powers to labour in the last war had in effect broken down.      In any event, thequestion whether compulsion should be applied to labour did not affect their main proposals.Some discussion ensued as to whether thedifficulties which applied to the inauguration of aMinistry of Supply at the present time would not also apply in war.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEthought that if it became essential to set up aMinistry of Supply in war, the dislocation would not prove so great as was anticipated.      In any event thepresent was the last moment at which we could affordany action which might delay production.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF defence said that he had received a letter from Colonel Greenly,the Chairman of the Advisory Panel of Industrialists,giving the Panel&apos;s views on the question whetherorganisation would be materially improved by thecreation of a Ministry of Supply.      The Panel&apos;conclusions were that a Ministry of Supply was inprinciple very desirable, but that they did notadvocate its establishment under present conditions,as in their opinion this would involve a delay inthe fulfilment of the re-armament programme.   Neitherwas it their view that it should of necessity beestablished automatically on the outbreak of war,- 17 -
as such a step would only add to the temporaryconfusion that would he hound to arise in the change-over from peace to war conditions.       The Panel were,however, of the opinion that, in order that such a Ministrymight he brought into being with the maximum rapidity assoon as the moment, was, in the opinion of the Cabinet,opportune, the whole of the organisation of the ministry should be worked out in detail now,  even to the extent ofearmarking individuals to fill the more important posts, ofproviding for its location under war conditions and of drafting the legislation conferring the requisite compulsory powers.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that he was ingeneral agreement with the view that a Ministry of supply should not now be set up.      The Air Ministry&apos;s relationswith industry were now very satisfactory, and the settingup of a Ministry of Supply would probably be to some extenta disadvantage.      In effect, they had set up a miniatureMinistry of Supply in the Air Ministry, and they did not want any disturbance of the present arrangements in timeof peace.     He was also in general agreement with ColonelGreenly&apos;s view that it did not follow that a Ministry should necessarily be established automatically on the outbreak ofwar.      That matter would be for decision by the War cabinet when the time came.There were two points on which he was at variance with the Minister&apos;s Memorandum. The first was theproposal, in paragraph 26(iv), to settle now whether or notthe Admiralty should be included in the scope of a Ministryof Supply,     He pointedout that the previous Minister forCo-ordination of Defence, in a Memorandum which he had submitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence in Januarylast (C.I.D. Paper No. 1505-B, annexed to C.Po-23 (39)),had proposed that the decision should be deferred until theoutbreak of war.     He was not sure why it was now proposed
7*t5    i:Jto vary this procedure, more especially since the questionwhether or not the Admiralty should toe included in theMinistry of Supply would surely depend upon the extent ofthe Admiralty&apos;s demands on the outbreak of war, which couldnot now toe foreseen.    On these grounds he thought that adecision on the inclusion or exclusion of the admiralty should toe reserved.&apos;    - :; /&apos;.      ..   i&quot;&apos;:-:&apos;: i&apos;.v&apos;i :- &apos;/ .- V       &apos; rsj -   - . - v    &apos; . &apos;-v    -,r^ /.;:&apos;&quot;&apos;. :: &quot; -  /      -&quot;/v, - &apos;: ; V - &apos;  &apos; -   :&apos; - [:%ltj    . -      &quot; -v.    .&apos;The second point on which he differed from theMemorandum concerned the question of compulsory powers overlabour, already referred toe      In his view this question alsoshould be decided in the light of events as they existed atthe time when a Ministry was set up.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that he thoughtthat the Ministry of Supply would be called into beingprimarily for mass-production, which did not apply to the specialised products the Admiralty mainly required.Further, the shipbuilding industry was highly specialised andunfitted for other requirements.       He did not anticipate any great increase in the rate of shipbuilding for the Navyafter the outbreak of the war, although there might be aconsiderable increase in merchant shipbuilding.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE s^id that, *fc***-wa*   , /&apos;-not in ag^rai^dajae^-w^fej^the inff^matebtfofflaa^^ -    -Continuing.,  THE FIRST LORD said that big ships took a very long time to build and that it v/as not,&apos; therefore,proposed to increase materially the number of big ships tobe laid down after the outbreak of war.     There might,however, be some increase in the smaller ships.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR pointed out that thepaper submitted by the former&apos; Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence had taken the view that a Ministry of Supply in thefull sense would be inevitable in an emergency (C.I.D. PaperNo. 1505-B).    He (the  Secretary of State) thought that, if thiswas so, it was better that, the Ministry should be establishednow, when it could be. set up without dislocation.   He proposed- 19 -
9 ?st! J *Jthat the existing supply &quot;branches should he left in theirpresent offices, but placed under the control of a singleMinistero Thus a common experience and purpose would be acquired, in his view there was no need to give theproposed Ministry of Supply any compulsory powers in timeof peace.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defenoe had-saidthat the departments concerned were adverse to making thechange now, on the grounds of the dislocation which wouldresult.     No doubt different opinions were held on thissubject.     The permanent head of his own Department (theWar Office) had come to the conclusion that the War office was at present overloaded, that the establishment of aMinistry of Supply would, on the whole, be an advantage,and that it would be favoured by public opinion.     Asregards the chain of responsibility from the user throughthe designer to the producer? the Secretary of State for Warthought that it was possible to have too close contacts between the user and the designer, with the result thatfrequent changes were made in design resulting in delay.He proposed that the procedure adopted in the last war should be followed, and that the Ministry of Supply should include a representative of each of the Service Departments,who would be responsible to the Service Minister concerned and who would act as a liaison officer between the service department and the Ministry of Supply.Another advantage of the Ministry of supply would be that it might help to build up a corps of designers.The shortage of designers was one of great weaknesses.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR thought that conclusion (viii)xwas phrased rather too sharply, and he invited attention tothe concluding paragraph of his Memorandum.     If the cabinet decided to make preparations for a Ministry of Supply he- 20 -
thought that his Department could make    a useful contri-bution by preparing a paper which would show, not only whatpreparations should be made in the future, but. also the pasthistory of this matter,.     This course was agreed to.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he agreed that conclusion(viii) required amendment.     He thought the draft legislation for setting up the Ministry of Supply should includecompulsory powers over labour,; and that the existence  ofsuch powers would be useful, even although not used inpractice.,     As regards the question whether the admiralty should be included in the ambit of the Ministry of Supply,he thought that conclusion (iv) went rather too far.   while there was probably a good case for leaving the greater partof Admiralty supply work with the Admiralty, there werebranches of supply where the same considerations were notinvolved and where the Admiralty were perhaps more likely * tt*-came into conflict with the other Department;    for example,ammunition,, s&quot;^-for War, he was rather puzzled as to the difference 0f view-on this matter between the War Office and the Air Ministry.The former favoured the establishment of a Ministry of Supplywhereas the latter thought that the creation of a ministry would interfere with the system of production that they had established.    His own view was that, if on other grounds it did not appear necessary to set up a Ministry of Supply intime of peace, the case put forward by the War Office wouldnot justify a  contrary decision.Ministry of Supply was growing.   He (the Prime Minister)thought that this demand was dependent on the view takenby the public as to whether we were getting the goods we wanted.    Now that public opinion was becoming satisfied onthat point, he thought the demand for a Ministry of supply would die down.Asregards the observations of the Secretary of StateIt had been suggested that the public demand for a
r* M t&quot;0THE PEL SIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE said that he had always favoured the establishment of a Ministry of supply in time of peace.      It seemed clear, however, that thegeneral body of opinion was against this course.-,     Hethought that it should be recognised that, as a corollary of this decision it was unlikely that a Ministry of supply would be set up in time of. war.     All the arguments now being used against the immediate establishment of a Ministry ofSupply would be urged, with even greater cogency, in timeof war     Prom this, he thought, two conclusions followed.First, that the grant of compulsory powers to requisitionproductive capacity must not be dependent on the setting upof a Ministry of Supply,     Secondly, that Departments shouldnot be encouraged to devcte all their planning to the establish-ment of a Ministry of Supply, but rather to devote their attention to co-operation between Departments on the assumptionthat such a Ministry would not be set up.THE CHANCELLOR OF TH/i DUCHY OF LANCASTER explainedthat, if the proposals in the Memorandum were accepted,it would mean that we should go ahead at once withpreparations for setting up a Ministry of Supply in timeof war as quickly as possible.,     The extent of the dis-location consequent upon the setting up of a ministry would depend upon the extent to which full plans hadbeen worked out beforehand..     No effective steps couldbe taken to set up a Ministry until these plans had been .completed.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said thathe was not too certain that a conflict of interest might not arise between the Admiralty and Board of Trade,even in time of peace.     He suggested, therefore, thatwe should not be too forthright in any statements now made that a Ministry of Supply would not be set up in time
(*tS1 iS &apos;0of -peace.     At the same time it was important to presson with our preparations for the establishment of theMinistry .THE PRIME MINISTER said that there w&amp;s nothing in the summary of recommendations in the last paragraphof the Memorandum which implied that in no circumstances would a Ministry of Supply be set up in time of peace.The recommendations in the Memorandum were clearly related to circumstances as they could be foreseen to-day.After further discussion the Cabinet agreed:-To approve the recommendations in theMemorandum by the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence and the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, as summarised above, subjectto the following:-(a) Conclusion (iv) should read as follows;-11 The Ministry of Supply should beresponsible for supply for the War Officeand the Air Ministry and for some part;but not the whole, of the Admiraltyrecpiirements, unless and until the stressesof war compel the inclusion of the whole;suitable safeguards for the &quot;user&quot; mustbe enforced.11(b) Recommendation (viii) should read aaas follows:-&quot;While some doubt exists as to theextent to which use.can be made of com-pulsory powers over labour, a provisionfor such compulsory powers should beincluded in the draft legislation forthe establishment of a Ministry of Supply.&quot;
THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP defence said that these proposals had their origin in a recommendation made by the Committee of Imperialfollowing documents on the subject of acceleration of Mobilisation:-(l)   A Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (0oPo 52 (59)),covering an Extract from the draft minutes of the 347th Meeting of theCommittee of Imperial Defence(Minute 4), together with a Reportby the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee(CoIoDo Paper No. 1526-B)o     /TheConclusions reached by the Committeeof Imperial Defence are set out as annex III ^(2)   A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for War (CPc 53 (39))containing proposals to secure theremoval of a restrictive undertakingaffecting service in the TerritorialArmy, which had been promised that men would go overseas with their ownunitso      After explaining thepresent position,  the Secretary ofState proposed to inform the House ofCommons that while every effort would be made to preserve the integrity of units, it would not be possible toensure that every Territorial would remain, until he went overseas, withhis original unit, and that transfersmight be inevitable.

The Cabinet had under consideration thefollowing documents on the subject of acceleration of Mobilisation:-(l)   A Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (CoP0 52 (59)),covering an Extract from the draft minutes of the 347th Meeting of theCommittee of Imperial Defence(Minute 4), together with a Reportby the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee(Co I,Do Paper No, 1526-B)0     /TheConclusions reached by the Committeeof Imperial Defence are set out as annex 111.^7(2)   A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for War (C.P. 53 (39))containing proposals to secure theremoval of a restrictive undertakingaffecting service in the TerritorialArmy, which had been promised that men would go overseas with their ownuniiSo     After explaining thepresent position, the Secretary ofState proposed to inform the House ofCommons that while every effort would be made to preserve the integrity of units, it would not be possible toensure that every Territorial would remain, until he went overseas, withhis original unit, and that transfersmight be inevitableo     Each manwould be invited to agree to serve on the new understanding, and ifthere were any men who found themselves unable to accept the invitation to waive their rights,he would propose to give them the option of taking their discharge *The Secretary of State also proposed to announce the invitationin (c) of the Conclusions of theCommittee of Imperial Defence(quoted in Annex III).THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF defence said that these proposals had their origin in a recommendation made by the Committee of Imperial
Defence at the end of December that consideration should be given to the possibility of shorteningthe period at present necessary for bringing theNavy, Army and Air Force on to a war footing.Paragraph 4 of the Report by the Chiefs of Staff(C.I.D. Paper no 1526-B) did not perhaps dealaltogether adequately with the question of calling up by Royal Proclamation, or by Order-in-Council,but this was not a matter with which he need troublethe Cabinet,,     Broadly,  the position was reported as satisfactory in the case of the Navy and the AirForceB      It was therefore only necessary to considerthe position of the Army, and he suggested that theSecretary of State for War should explain hisproposalsoTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR explainedthat the coast defence and anti-aircraft units ofthe Territorial Army could already be called up by individual agreements in advance of generalmobilisationo     This procedure was covered bySection 13 of the Territorial and Reserve forces act, 1907, which empowered the Crown &quot;to accept theoffer of any part or men of the Territorial Force&quot;to be called up whether or not the Territorial Forgeitself was embodiedc     The Secretary of Stateexplained that, in the recent crisis, the rest of theTerritorial Army, apart from the units covered bythe procedure referred to, had asked to be embodied.The proposal in paragraph 7 of C0P0&quot;53 (59)) was toextend the procedure of calling up by individualagreement to cover the whole Territorial Army.     Hewas advised that this action was within the legallimits of the Act.     At the same time he thought therewas a risk that this procedure might result in his- 25 -
1*1being accused of going &quot;behind the Statute, and hehad grave doubts whether he should adopt this course,rathernthan have legislationDiscussion ensued as to whether it was necess-ary to have legislation for this purpose.THE PRIME MINISTER was opposed to legislationunless it was absolutely necessary.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that civil emergencymust be borne in mind in this connection.    At the timeof the General Strike there had been a proposal thatthe Territorial Force should be embodied in a newforce - the Civil Constabulary ReserveIt was then suggested that the Secretary ofState for War might sound parliamentary opinion,either, by a passage in his speech on the army estimates or preferably by a Parliamentary question and Answer.    He might indicate, in guarded language,  .that he had under consideration the question of extending the procedure for calling out which nowapplied to the Coast Defence and Anti-aircraft units, to other units of the Territorial Army andthat he was proposing to consult the Council of territorial Associations on this matter.    provided this suggestion did not meet with opposition thematter could then probably be disposed of without legislation.    It was, however, suggested that itshould be made plain that the power to call out these units prior to the embodiment of Territorial forces should be confined to an emergency related to someForeign Power and should not apply to civil emergency.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE drew attention to various paragraphs in the Chiefs of StaffsReport which emphasized the desirability of timelydecision by the Government to authorise executive action in emergency.
Turning to the proposal -made in the ChiefsOf Staff Report that steps should he taken to enableSection A of the Reserve to be called out for service at home, it was explained that this would necessitatelegislation.    It was agreed that the issues involved should be submitted to the appropriate legalauthorities.After a short discussion, the Cabinet agreedto accept the Secretary of State for War&apos;s proposals in paragraphs 1 to 6 of his Memorandum (CP.  53 (39))and authorised him to make a statement on the lines proposed in paragraph 6 as to Territorial personnelserving with their own units.The Cabinet agreed:-(1) To take note of the conclusions ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence,appended as Annex III to these minutes, on acceleration of mobilisation;(2) To authorise the Secretary of State forWar to make a statement, preferably inreply to a Parliamentary Question,indicating that he had under consideration the extension to other units of theTerritorial Army of the procedure atpresent applied to Coast Defence andA.A. units of the Territorial Army,whereby personnel of those units undertaketo come up for service in an emergency,when required by the Secretary of Statefor War:(3) That if it was apparent that no opposition was likely to be raised to this course,the Secretary of State for War should beauthorised to apply this procedure tounits of the Territorial Army generally onthe lines indicated in paragraph 7 of cp.  53 (39):(4) To approve the Secretary of State for War&apos;proposal as set out in paragraph 6 of cp.  53 (39) as to the removal of the restrictive undertaking affecting service in the Territorial Army:(5) That the Secretary of State for War -should consult further with theappropriate legal authorities with regardto the proposal to introduce legislation to make Section A of the Reserveliable to be called up for service athome.

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Scotland (CP.-54 (39))calling attention to two points of difficulty arising ,out of the present statutory provisions governing the disqualification of Burgh Councillors in Scotland,and relating to -(i)    The right of Councillors who occupyCouncil houses to vote on housingmatters$(ii)    The placing of contracts by localauthoritites with co-operative societies in which members of thelocal authority have an interest.In regard to (i), difficulties had arisen in anumber of Burghs owing to the high proporition OfCouncillors occupying Council housesoAs regards (ii), there were many areas inScotland in which contracts with Co-operative Societieswere in existence, and there was a danger that under present conditions a large number of Councillors wouldhave to vacate their offices.In England both cases were regulated by Section?6 of the Local Government Act, 1933, which gave theMinister of Health power to remove any disabilityimposed by that Section.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR SCOTLAND Sought theauthority of his colleagues to announce the governments intention to legislate, and to prepare and submit to the Committee of Home Affairs a draft of thenecessary Bill on the above lines, the effect of whichwould be to bring the Scottish law into line withthe English law.The Cabinet agreed to this proposal.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thoughtthat, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer was absent that morning through indisposition, themost convenient course would be to postponediscussion on the Memorandum by the Lord privy seal (H.A. 9 (39)), covering the draft CampsBill, together with the Conclusions reachedthereon by the Committee of Home Affairs(H.A.C. 5th Conclusions (39)), until the nextweekly Meeting of the Cabinet.This course was agreed to.

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary (CP.-51 (39)) drawing attentionto two Private Members&apos; Bills, namely, the ClubsBill in the House of Lords, and the Clubs Registra-tion Bill in the House of Commons.    The former bill was down for Second Reading on the 2nd March, andthe latter on the 17th March.    Attached to theMemorandum was a summary of the main provisions ofthe existing law relating to the sale of intoxica-ting liquor in Clubs, and of the recommendationsof the Royal Commission of 1929-31.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME affairs explained that the Bill in the House of Lords would come up for discussion that afternoon, whereas theHouse of Commons Bill would not come up for Debatefor a fortnight.   He proposed, therefore, on thepresent occasion to deal only with the House ofLords Bill.    The view which the Government had consistently taken was that, while it was possibleto introduce legislation to deal separately withbogus clubs, the other questions dealt with in theReport of the Royal Commission on Licencing shouldbe reserved for a comprehensive measure dealing withthe licencing problem as a whole,    The present bill was open to objection on the ground that it wentfurther than was necessary to deal with the issue ofbogus clubs.  Further, on the clubs- issue, it would -arouse the maximum degree, of oppositionc    He propo&amp;adtherefore, that the Bill should be opposed on thegrounds indicated.
THE CABINET agreed to this co .rse.THE HOME SECRETARY added that it now seemed likely that proposals could he put forward fordealing with the clubs question which would meet with a general measure of agreement.    He proposed todeal with this matter at next week&apos;s Cabinet.
TOCAL AUTHORITIES(ENABLING) BILL.(previous reference;Cabinet 10(38), Con-elusion 14.)9, The attention of the Cabinet was drawn tothe Local Authorities    (Enabling) Bill, introduced in the House of Commons by a Private Member and down for Second Reading on Friday, 10th March, 1939.It was agreed that the Ministryof Health should, have authorityto arrange for Governmentopposition to this Bill.

They suggested.,however, that the Government Spokesmen, at the commence-ment of the Committee State of the Bill, should explain that the Government had had insufficient opportunityto examine the amendments proposed in the Bill, and thatas the new proposals were likely to involve considerablelabour and increased staff, and consequent expense, theGovernment was bound to consider them seriously and mighthave to move amendments at a later stage.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES saidthat this Bill, if it passed into law, would involve his department in a great deal of work.     At the same time,as it was clear that the Bill would only be accepted bythe landowners if the Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries were prepared to undertake the work involved, hethought that the right course was for the Ministry toaccept these new responsibilitiesa     These responsibilities would, however, involve considerable increases in staff,and he hoped that the Treasury would not raise objections
%1on this account.     Further the Bill created, a numberof new offenses, and he asked whether it would bepossible for the Law Officers of the Crown to assume responsibility for the Bill in the House of Commons.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought the chief whip should be consulted on this latter point.     he understood that the Treasury would not raise objectionto the Bill on the ground that it would involve theMinistry in new duties, requiring increased staff, butthe Treasury would of course have to be consulted asto the extent of these increasesDTHE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE pointed outthat this Bill, notwithstanding its title, appearedto deal with foreshores.     He therefore asked theMinister to keep in touch with his Department.This was agreed to,THE SECRETARY OF STAT.; FOR SCOTLAND thought that,provided agreement could be reached between thevarious interests concerned, namely, the ScottishRamblers1 Association, the landowners and the localauthorities, the Bill should apply to Scotland;     other-wise the Bill should not apply to Scotland.The Cabinet agreed -To approve the course proposed bythe Minister of Agriculture andFisheries and the Secretary ofState for Home Affairs in theirjoint Memorandum (c.P. 57 (39)),summarised above

The French Government accordedGeneral Franco recognition on the same day as His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the following other Governments have nowalso accorded General Franco1s Government recognition:Venezuela,, Bolivia, Egypt, Greece and Australia0     the lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian Governments have taken a similar decision but the actual recognition has not yetbeen announced and the four Nordic Ministers are following the situation closely with a view to taking a  similarstep as soon as the situation is a little clearer.His Majesty&apos;s Missions at Saint Jean de Luz and tothe late Government of Spain are being withdrawn and Mr.0&apos;Malley and Mr.. Stevenson with their staffs are beingsummoned back to London.     Meanwhile the situation in that part of Spain controlled by the remains of the lateSpanish Government continues to be very obscure.     PresidentAzana has resigned and left the Spanish Embassy in Paris-1-
for another residence in France.     Dr* Negrin&apos;s actualwhereabouts are uncertain and it would appear that his authority is now being set aside by Colonel Casado, thepresent commander of the Spanish Government forces roundMadrid, who is reported to be endeavouring to form withSignor Bestero, the nucleus of a new Republican Governmentfor the purpose of concluding an early armistice withGeneral Franco&apos;s government.     This move, if it is made,will be in the nature of a coup d&apos;etat in regard to which Dr.. Negrin has apparently not been consulted.Foreign Office,2nd March, 1939,
r* ^ANNEX    II.STAFF CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FRENCH.Note by the Foreign Office.On 24th February the French Government agreed toconversations on the basis suggested.    They said thatGeneral Gamelin had been asked to establish contact with (the competent British authorities in order to fix theplan of work.    In addition, the French Naval staff was equipped with a special delegation to engage in.conversations with the Admiralty.   General Gamelin was ready to enter upon the initial examination of theproblem as soon as the British authorities thought fit.He was holding himself at the disposal of the repre-sentatives of the British forces, either in Paris orLondon,H.M. Ambassador in Paris had already been instructed, to communicate to the French Government on receipt of the French reply, the detailed proposals ofH.M. Government in regard to procedure and to enquire whether they agreed.    These instructions, based on tlte-recommendations of the Committee of Imperial Defence laiddown that the conversations should be conducted on a lower level than that of Chiefs of Staff.    They thusruled out the French offer that General Gamelin should conduct the conversations on the French side.
*rt. r-j5 i. *JSir E. Phipps, having &quot;been told that these instructions were not to he modified, because of the reference in the French reply to General Gamelin,communicated our proposals regarding procedure on85th February.   We are now waiting for the French replyto this further communication.One alteration, however, was made in these proposals as presented to the French.    It had originally been proposed by the Committee of Imperial Defence that stageone of the conversations should be opened by giving to the French a paper showing in broad outline the strategical position as seen from London.    This was, on lord Chatfield&apos;s advice, omitted.   Meanwhile the ForeignOffice have suggested instead that such a paper should besent over to.Paris for communication in advance ofGeneral Gamelin by the Military Attache.    If this idea is approved it would bring the General into the pictureat once without making him part of the French delegation.Foreign Office,1st March, 1939.
