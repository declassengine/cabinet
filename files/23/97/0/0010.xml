Mr. Ashton-Gwatkin had been in Berlina week, and had seen Herr von Rihhentrop, Dr. Funkand Field - Marshal Goeringo     The atmosphere had beenvery friendly, and he had gained the impression thatno immediate adventures of a large type were contemplated.     This, however, did not rule out thepossibility of further pressure being brought to bearon Czechoslovakia,      Field-Marshal Goering had stated. that he was not aware of any plans for a venture inthe Ukraine.     Dr. Funk had said that he wanted to restore the Mark to equality with the Pound and withthe Dollar;   which would, seem to assume the removalof Exchange control.THE PRIME MINISTER interposed that he understood that this represented Herr Hitier!instructions to Dr. Funk.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that the general impression gained was that the visit had been useful.One observer had reported that the Germans had beenexcited about the visit beforehand, and pleasedafterwards.
British AFFAIRS sa:..:d that some discussion had takenRepresentationat his Coronation.     place as to how this country should herepresented at the Pope&apos;s Coronation,     The two alternative courses were, first,  that our Ministerat the Vatican, Mr. Osborne, should he given special rank for the purpose;    second, that the duke of Norfolk, should he appointed as the Kingrsspecial representative.      It had been suggested&amp;y win1 Minla Lejir-rrlr^tire &quot;VSt iriregaa-that the Pope mightprefer the former course, and might be embarrassedif we were to take any very special steps in thismatter, more especially since the French were sending a large delegation.     On the other hand,it had now been learned that President Roosevelthad instructed Mr. Kennedy to represent him atthe Coronation.      The United States had neverbefore been represented at the Coronation of aPope,       He (the Secretary of State) had reachedthe conclusion that the right course would be toarrange that the Duke of Norfolk should go as theKing&apos;s special representative, and steps had nowbeen taken accordingly.     He hoped that theCabinet would not feel that action should not havebeen taken without prior reference to them, but other nations were making their arrangements andit had been necessary to reach an early decision.He had since learned from Monsignor Godfrey,the the Apostolic Delegate&apos; in this country, thatthe decision that the Duke of Norfolk should go asthe King&apos;s special representative had given muchpleasure to the Vatican.The Cabinet approved the steps takenin this matter.
Refugees in southern Prance(previous reference:Cabinet 2(39), Con-clusion 2.)that considerable public feeling was arising as to thecondition of the refugees from Spain now in SouthernFrance.    These refugees were located in a numberof camps, in which the conditions v/ere nothingshort of scandalous.Certain tentative enquiries had been made ofthe French Government as to what action v/e might take to help them.    It had emerged that the french would have liked us to send a Hospital Ship, suchas the &quot;MAINE&quot;, but the Admiralty had not found it possible to adopt this course.The only other alternative would be for theBritish Government to offer to take some actionthrough such a body as the British Red Cross.   TheBritish Red Cross Society had sent out Sir John Kennedy,who had made a report on the matter.    It appeared that if the Government were willing to make, say, 20,000 available, the British Red Cross were in aposition to supply shirts, blankets, medicines, andso forth.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that hethought it impossible for us to make a grant to theFrench Government in this matter.    If, however, therewere some independent organisation which was in aposition to give practical assistance, he was disposed to agree that it would be right to make a. sum of, say 20,000 available for this purpose.    It.would, however,be necessary to ascertain clearly what scheme theBritish Red Cross Society had in mind, and for theGovernment to satisfy themselves that the scheme was a practicable one.
$09e*l U 4*Evacuation of refugees fromSovernraentSpain.THE PRIME MINISTER asked how long it was thoughtthat the refugees would remain in Prance?THE FOREIGN SECRETARY replied that he did not know; he had been unable to obtain any information fromthe French as to these refugees.Continuing, THE PRIME MINISTER said that hethought it would be very necessary, before we enteredinto commitments, to satisfy ourselves as to the praticability of any scheme put forward.    It wasimpossible for two separate authorities both to beresponsible for looking after the same body of refugees.He was not certain how it was proposed to select the refugees for which the British Red Cross organisation should be responsible.    He was not altogether satisfiedthat the proposal to send a ship should be ruled outentirely, even if a Hospital Ship was not available.In the course of discussion a message wasreceived by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to the effect that, according to later information, the sum required for the assistance of refugees in France would amount to  45,000,THE CABINET agreed -To approve generally the proposal that a sumof money, to be agreed between theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, should bemade available as a grant for the assistanceof Spanish refugees in France, providedthat a practicable scheme could be worked out for administrering the proposed grant.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat pressure was developing in favour of this countryhelping to rescue some 5,000 or- 10,000 persons inGovernment Spain, who it was thought would be in danger if and when General Franco became master ofthe whole country.    He had received a 3otter on thismatter from Sir Arthur Salter, M.P.
ft t*i e*jTHE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he was quite clear that he could not take the action proposed,-hut the reasons which should he advanced in justification for taking no action were, perhaps, not so easy to determine.    It seemed to him, however, that weshould have to make certain, before evacuatingrefugees, that they were not criminals whom no oneought to wish to save from their proper fate.   Hethought it was impossible for us to make ourselvesresponsible for the mass evacuation of whoever wishedto leave Spain for whatever reason.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought .theaction suggested would amount to intervention.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS saidthat we were already experiencing trouble withundesirables getting into this country, but he assumed that we should, if need be, have to allowDr. Negrin and a few other leaders to enter thecountry.THE PRIME MINISTER said that admitting a numbea?of political leaders was a different thing from sending ships to fetch away whoever wished to leaveSpain.The Cabinet approved generally thecourse proposed to be taken by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs,
9 0 *tcial[stance to.4. THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that anannouncement on this matter would he made in the house that day.    It was very regrettable that a badly-phrasedand premature announcement should have been made in thegviouserence:inet 8 (39)conclusion 4).   Daily TelegraphoThe Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;then read out thestatement which was to be made that afternoon in answer to a parliamentary Question and which explained the scheme proposed. He pointed out that the tJme factor was very important in this matter in order to avoid speculators talcingadvantage of the interval between the announcement of thescheme and the date when effect would be given to it.The Bill would be presented to the Home Affairs Committeeon Monday and he asked that, If the Home AffairsCommittee approved the Bill, he should have authorityto present it on Tuesday and to circulate it on Wednesday.He thought that the Bill was likely to be well received in the House of Commons*    The fund would be managed by a Committee in Hong Kong composed of two members representing the Chinese Government Banks, onerepresenting the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, one the chartered Bank and one nominated by the ChineseGovernment in agreement with the Treasury and with theapproval of the Hong Kong and Chartered   Bankso    Por thelast-named post, it was proposed to nominate Mr* Rogers,who had served in the Bank of England,    It was, of course,a matter for speculation whether this Committee wouldmanage the Chinese Currency Stabilisation Pund assuccessfully as our own Equalisation Pund had been managed.
In reply to a question, the Chancellor of theExchequer explained that, if there was a profit on thewinding-up of the Fund, the British Banks share of theprofits would inure to the United Kingdom GovernmentExchequer.    On the other hand, if a loss was incurred,we should be responsible for reimbursing to the BritishBanks any loss incurred by them.The Cabinet agreed:To authorise the chancellor of theExchequer to arrange for the presentation and circulation of theBill, early in the ensuing week,without further reference to theCabinet, subject to the approval of theBill hy the Home Affairs Committee.
fi n f*it 5 0B3 LondonInferences.ftviousTerence:llixet 9 (39)Illusion 3).5. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES saidthat it was clear that the Palestine Conferences were now coming to the end of their tether.Discussions with the Jews.There was a considerable division of opinionamongst    the Jews, but this would not become knownpublicly.     For   example,- oti the constitutionalquestion, Dr, Weizmann was in favour of the establish-ment of an independent Palestine State, provided thatthe State was a Federal State.      Some of the leadingJews supported him.     He was, however, strongly opposedin this matter by Mr. Ben-Gurion and Mr, Shertok, andother extreme Zionists.     The latter party had carriedthe day at the beginning of last week, when there had beena leakage of information as to our proposals, and theJewish representatives had declined to continueconversations on the basis of those proposals.Discussions had, however, been continued on an informalbasis and he thought they would continue for at least two or three days longer.Tho Colonial, Secretary thought that if theconstitutional question was the only question at issuehe would have seen no reason why we should fail toreach agreement with the Jews.     The main issue, however,was immigration.     On this point also, the Jews were divided amongst themselves.      At a meeting held theprevious night between the representatives of the neighbouring Arab States, Dr. Weizmann  and    certain other Jewish representatives, and British representatives,Ali Maher Pasha had made an excellent statement.
fi) 0 3He had said that the Jews had now advanced a considerable way in Palestine and that before they advanced any further,peril/&quot;/fathey should consolidate the wagg they had alreadyoccupied.      If they were to make any further advance,it would be necessary for them to do so in agreement withthe Arabs.      Dr, Weizmann had expressed general agreementwith this, although his agreement, of course, relatedonly to general principles and not to specific figures of immigration.     Mr. Ben-Gurion, however, had adopted anentirely different view, and had taken the line thatJewish immigration should continue at an ever-increasingrate.It was also clear that there was still a markeddivergence between what Dr. V/eizmann on the one handand the Arab States on the other, would accept as asettlement of the immigration problem.      Dr.. Weizmannwould accept a figure of 20,000 a year for five yearsprovided the position thereafter was left open, but hewould not agree to what would be tantamount to giving theArabs power to veto any Jewish immigration whatever after five years.In regard to land sales also, the colonial secretary said that the Jewish representatives had beenvery difficult and that he was not hopeful of reachingany agreement with them/     He was hoping to arrange fora further discussion that evening between representativesof the Arabs and the Jews and the British Government.He was afraid that the difficulties in the way of asettlement would probably prove insoluble.
** o oThe Colonial Secretary then gave an account ofthe discussions with the Arabs.      These discussions hadmainly centred on the constitutional questions, e,g.,    .   such issues as the transitional period, safeguards for*   *a swseaF&amp;ie&quot;&amp;, etc.      Some progress had been made.      On allthese matters the Palestine Arabs had proved verydifficult, while the representatives of the neighbouring arab States had been more reasonable.Discussion with the Arabs had also touched on immigration.     For the first time the representatives ofthe Palestine Arabs had given an indication that theymight be willing to agree to the continuance of someJewish immigration.      The representatives of the neighbour-ing Arab States had strongly supported the Palestine Arabsin public, but in private they had indicated that theywere prepared to contemplate the immigration of 50,000Jews over a period of five years, provided that the Arabswere in a position to veto the continuance of Jewish&apos; immigration after that date.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said thathe thought this figure was insufficient.      The Jews wouldhave to make considerable concessions on other points,and he thought that the total figure of immigrationover the next five years should be 100,000;    certainly not less than 80,000.      This latter figure would representthe normal immigration quota of 12,000 a year, withan additional 10,000 in each of the first two years to cover
child immigrants   or old men and women from Germany,He thought that it was just possible that therepresentatives of the neighbouring Arab States would agree to this figure.      It was quite clear, however, thatno agreement could be reached with the representatives ofthe neighbouring Arab States, and still less with thePalestine Arabs unless there v/as an Arab veto on furtherimmigration at the end of five years6      It was obvious,therefore, that the veto on immigration was the crux ofthe whole problem since it was impossible to reach agreement with the Jews on this basis.      It v/as alsoclear that there would be considerable opposition in theUnited States, but he thought that a settlement onthese lines could be got through in the end.The Secretary of State for the Colonies reminded his colleagues that the Cabinet decision on this matter had been to authorise him to reach a settlement on the immigration question on the basis of a total immigrationover the next ten years which would bring the Jews upto 35/6 or 40% of the total population of the country.These percentages represented a total immigration of150,000 and 300,000 respectively spread over ten years.It was absolutely impossible to reach a settlement withthe Arabs on this basis, and he was satisfied that thebest we could get would be an immigration figureof 75,000 to 100,000 spread over five years, with an
Arab power to veto Jewish immigration after that date.The Cabinet Committee on Palestine had been prepared toauthorise him to deal with the matter on this basis,and he asked for authority to put forward to both sidesa Specific proposal on these lines during the course ofthe next few days.The Colonial Secretary said that although itmight become evident almost immediately that the conferences had reached a deadlock, he thought that itwould be necessary to continue the Conferences for a fewmore days in order to Wind up discussion on certain points.It was also desirable not to let the Jews feel that theywere being hustled.   There was a further reason for keeping the Conferences going for some days longer, andthat was that as soon as we told either Jews or Arabs ourdefinite decision as to the Arab veto on immigration at theend of five years, this decision would become publicproperty.   It was important that this should not happenuntil we were ready with a statement of our policy overthe whole field.   He thought, however? that it might bedesirable to have discussions with the representativesof the neighbouring Arab States on the basis that we wereprepared to agree to the veto and wished to discuss thematter with them.   He hoped that we should be in aposition to obtain at least their neutrality, if nottheir agreement/ to our proposalseTHE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat while it was conceivable that we might reach agreementwith regard to the number of Jewish immigrants over the
SJ1 aj J.next five years, he did not think that agreement could he reached as to the method of determining the number of immigrants to be allowed thereafter.   He agreed thatthere was no chance of obtaining support from the neighbouring Arab States unless we agreed to give theArabs the power to veto further Jewish immigration after five years   He was satisfied that a good case could bemade for this course.   Progress could only be made on theconstitutional side if the Jews and the Arabs wereprepared to work together.   Hitherto the Jews had not made any attempt to work with the Arabs,   He thought thatthe present scheme   gave each side a strong inducement to work with the other, the Arabs because they wishedfor progress in the constitutional field, the Jews becausethey wished to have the Arabs&apos; consent to continue jewish immigration after five years,.THE MINISTER OP TRANSPORT naid that he attahcedsome importance to the position as to immigration after five years being stated positively and not negatively,I,e, that it should be said that the number of jewish immigrants after five years would be  determined byagreement with the Arabs rather than that no Jews shouldbe allowed to enter the country after five years unless:the Arabs agreed,THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had come, though with some reluctance, to.the view that the course putforward by the Secretary of State for the Colonies was inevitable,   He would have liked, if possible, to have
9 (I 9el kIdone rather more for the Jews who might he..oonsidered- tohave heen rather roughly treated if the variousexpectations held out to them -in.previous years were taken into account.   He was satisfied however, that itwas impossible to obtain a better bargain for them.   Hethought that the prospects of an agreed solution would be considerably improved if the Jews could be made torealise that continued immigration after five yearsdepended on Arab friendship.   He was also not unhopefulthat after the end of the period of five years jewish immigration might prove possible not only into Palestine,but also into TransJordan.    If so, the prospect wasnot quite so bleak as it might appear^   In any eventPalestine could only accommodate a fraction of the Jewswho now wished to leave the countries in which they were at present living.   Prom the point of view of the Jewishrefugee problem as a whole, the difference between80,000 and 100,000 Jewish immigrants into Palestine overthe next five years was not very material.   He hoped thatthe Colonial Secretary would get as near to 100,000 aspossible.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH said that he had felt some difficulty in accepting the views of the Cabinet Committeeon the question of Jewish immigration.   The original proposal had been for the admission of 300,000 or 150,000Jews over ten years, but we were now considering a proposalfor 100,000 to 50,000 over five years.   Hewas afraid thatthis country might encounter serious trouble if jewish immigration was so drastically reduced.   He asked whetherit would not be possible to qualify the restrictions on with regard toimmigration / Palestine, as a whole, at the end of the
e,s    tifive year period by some reference to a system of cantonisation.He thought that the only hope for a solution of Palestine&apos;difficulties lay in a cantonal solution, each side having avery clear majority in its own cantons.    On this basis hethought that immigration of Jews might be allowed to continue on a limited scale into the Jewish Cantons, subject to special provisions, after the end of the period of five years-    If,however, all immigration was to be shut down absolutely, he was of despairafraid that the Jews might adopt.a policy/which would lead theirextremists into violent action such as had occurred in Palestinea week ago.   He hoped that by some means it would not be foundnecessary to agree to an absolute veto on migration at the endof the five year periodsTHE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES said that it,might perhaps be possible to obtain a solution on these lines ifthere was any prospect of reaching an immediate settlement infavour of some cantonal system.    He was clear, however, that sucha system could only come about by gradual development over theperiod of five years.Turning to the effects of his proposals he appreciated that one result might be an economic crisis in Palestineconsequential on loss of confidence by Jewish capitalists in theultimate future of the country.    Prom the Jewish point of view it was clear that our proposals would provoke opposition through-out world Jewry and that protests v/ould pour in from all over theglobe.   There would also be trouble in the United States.   he believed that the Jewish Americans could not work up a pro-Jewish agitation, but that they might be able to work up an anti-British agitation.   The plain fact was that the Jews had made no attempt to co-operate with the Arabs in the last twenty years butthey would now have to do soe
ei t) (J2The Colonial Secretary added that he was clearthat, if the proposals put forward were^not-adopted,we should experience serious difficulties with Ibn Saudand the neighbouring   Arab States,      On balance, he feltno doubt that the course proposed was both expedient, and was!also the right policy in the long run.      He agreed that jour statement of policy might include some indication that we were thinking of a policy of contonisation.THE LOPJ) CHANCELLOR said that, having made a careful study of the pledges and undertakings given at variousdates, in particular the statement made by CommanderHogarth to the Sherif of Mecca as to the meaning of the balfour declaration, he felt satisfied that the honour of this country demanded some such limitation of jewish immigration as the Colonial Secretary now proposed,THE PRIME MIMISTER said that if it was necessaryto face an outbreak of anti-British feeling in theUnited States, as a result of our Palestine policy, itwas better that this should happen at a time like thepresent, rather than at a time of acute internationalcrisis,THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that, havingregard to the harsh treatment which the Jews wereexperiencing elsewhere, he regretted that it was notpossible for us to do more to help them.     nevertheless he had reluctantly reached the conclusion that theline proposed by the Colonial Secretary was the right line,THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR INDIA said that allthe news which reached him confirmed the view that, unless we could go a long way to meet the Arab claims, we should
have serious trouble with the Indian M0slems.     We hadalready enough trouble on our hands with the Hindus.In his view the Colonial Secretary&apos;s proposal was theonly tenable oneeIn reply to the Prime Minister, THE SECRETARY OFSTATE FOR THE COLONIES said that he thought it would benecessary to publish our statement of policy in the nearfuture, probably early in the ensuing week.     he contemplated that the statement might take the form of a white Paper, in which he hope it would be possible toinclude letters from the representatives of the neighbouring Arab States, expressing their general sympathy with our decisions of policy,,On the proposal of the Prime Minister, theCabinet agreed -to authorise the issue of a statement ofpolicy on the general lines indicated bythe Colonial Secretary, on the understandingthat the form of the document should besettled by the Palestine Committee.
EIRE. 6,      The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Dominion AffairsForm ofPassports.  (CP.  59 (39)) regarding a letter he had receivedfrom the High Commissioner for Eire announcing  hisGovernment&apos;s intention to alter the form of Eirepassports by:- (l) the substitution of a formulaomitting the King&apos;s name from the &quot;request&quot; page;(2) the omission of the reference to &quot;BritishCommonwealth of Nations&quot;; and (3) the substitution of &quot;Ireland&quot; for &quot;Irish Free State&quot;.    The Secretaryof State proposed, if his colleagues agreed, to reply briefly to the High Commissioner to the effectthat His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdomgreatly regretted the proposed elimination of theKing&apos;s name from Eire passports, and that, in their view, this omission, when it became known, would beb ound to create a bad impression in the UnitedKingdom, and to widen the separation which Mr.de valera deplored between Eire and Northern Ireland.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR DOMINION affairs said that his first inclination had been not to take this matter too tragically, but on reflection he had thought that the Cabinet should be informed of theposition and should be given an opportunity of considering the form of reply which should be sent.After outlining the main points in his paper, the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs referred to two further points.    First, with referenceto paragraph 3, he read an extract from Mr. MacDonald&apos;s account of his interview with Mr.  de Valera inSeptember 1937, which made it plain that Mr.de Valera
had undertaken not to make any change in thismatter without consultation with us.    Nevertheless,as was explained in paragraph 6 in his paper, whatwas now put to us as a proposal did in factrepresent a definite decision.Secondly, the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs explained that the other matter which he had discussed with Mr. Dulanty on the16th February had been bomb outrages.    Mr.  Dulantyhad explained that while Mr.  de Valera was willingto allow the Eire Police to make enquiries in Eirewith a view to preventing bomb outrages in thiscountry, he was not willing to allow the EirePolice to obtain evidence in Eire in order toassist in the conviction of persons who had been arrested in this country for carrying out outrages.He had stated that if he allowed this, the LeftWing in Eire would take violent action.The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs reminded his colleagues that the statementof the 30th December 1937 had been issued aftermuch searching of heart.    The present proposalcarried a stage further the process of eliminating the   visible signs of connection between Eire andthe King.    Nothing was now left except the use ofthe King&apos;s name in foreign appointments.    Hethought that we had no choice between either makinga protest and leaving the matter there or attempting to carry the matter further,  in which case we might find ourselves in an even more difficult position.In the course of discussion the followingpoints were made.
eJ J 0First, it was generally agreed that attentionwould certainly he drawn in the House of commons and elsewhere to the altered form of the Eirepassports, and that it would he very desirableto have it on record that we had made a protestin regard to the change.    It was thought thatthe House of Commons v/ould adopt a very criticalline if no protest of any kind had been made.Secondly, it was considered whether it was desirable to include in the terms of any replya statement to the effect that the omission ofthe King&apos;s name from Eire passports would be boundto widen the separation between Eire and NorthernIreland.It was explained by the HOME secretary that the Northern Ireland Government (who were adopting a very difficult attitude at the presenttime) took the view that the gulf between Eireand Northern Ireland was so wide as to beimmeasurable.The view generally expressed was.that itmight be desirable to omit or at least to modify the reference to Northern Ireland.Thirdly, considerable emphasis was laid onthe large numbers of Irish labourers who came overto this country. It was pointed out that the onlyreason why they were able to come over withoutpassports was that they were subjects of the King,and it v/as this very point which Mr. de Valera was anxious to disavow.THE MINISTER OF LABOUR said that althoughit was impossible to produce evidence on the matter,since the insurance documents did not distinguishpersons who came from Ireland, he thought an-20-
unduly high proportion of persons who had beenunemployed for long periods were Irish.On the other hand, some importance was attachedby the MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES to theIrish labourers who came over for short periods foragricultural work.THE PRIME MINISTER thought, that while there might well be a good case on merits for therestriction of Irish immigrants to this country,   weshould not threaten to use this weapon in retaliationin the event of the Eire passports being alteredas was now proposed.    He.thought, however, that itwould be quite right that a reply should be sentsaying that there was already considerablediscontent here on the subject of relations withEire (including the immigration of Irish labourers),and that this discontent might well be exacerbatedby Mr.  de Valera&apos;s present proposal.ITHE HOME SECRETARY indicated that, from thesecurity point of view, he was gravely embarrased by the fact that there was no power to stopIrishmen coming over to this country from Ireland.Quite recently a number of members of the I.R.A.had landed at Holyhead with the intention of breaking up the International Rughy Football match between1England and Ireland,    These gangsters had beenturned back,  although there was in fact no powerto do it.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that he had that morning seen Mr.  de Valera, 1who was passing through London,on his way to Rome.Thereafter he was going to Zurich, and he had saidthat there were a number of matters which he would-21-I) IP?
like to discuss with him (the Dominions Secretary)on his return from Zurich.In reply to a suggestion that the reply shouldtake the form of urging Eire not to make the change proposed until after further discussion, theSECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS added thathe had already taken this matter up with Mr. Dulanty,who had informed him that the Eire Government had reached a definite decision on the matter.    He was,however, prepared to make another attempt.After discussion, the Cabinet agreed:-(l) To authorise the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs to send a writtenreply to Mr. Dulanty on the general lines indicated, subject to such modification as might be necessaryin the light of the Cabinet discussion:(2) To authorise the Secretary of.State forDominion Affairs to discuss the matter further with Mr. Dulanty, and toindicate to him that considerationof this matter had revealed asubstantial body of discontent in thiscountry over relations with Eire, whichmight well be exacerbated by theproposal to modify the form of Eirepassports on the lines suggested, and urging Mr, Dulanty to delay the issueof the new passport.
AIR RAIDPRECAUTIONSFinancialprovisions.[(previous reference:Cabinet 58 (38)Conclusion 8)fix.. /u-Cs*))(?.7.     The Cabine-t-had,. unde-js^Qns.consideration aMemorandum by the Lord Privy Seal (CP. 61 (39))submitting certain questions of principle involvedin the financial provisions of the Air Raid PrecautionsBill, which would impose novel obligations on industrial and commercial establishments, and interfere with private rights in buildings and houses.     The lord privy Seal explained the provisions of the Bill, whichcontemplated measures urgently necessary for theproper development of Civil Defence, and sought authority to make a comprehensive statement in theHouse, of Commons, at a very early date and in advanceof the publication of the Bill, regarding theobligations to be imposed, the financial assistance which would be forthcoming from the Exchequer, and thearrangements already made whereby the cost of air raidprecautionary measures undertaken by firms working on government contract on a costed basis was carried intothe price of their contracts over a two-year period.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL outlined the main points in his Memorandum.     He explained that he was anxiousto make a comprehensive statement covering the variouscases in which a contribution would be payable underthe Bill towards the cost of the obligations whichwere already recognised as falling on employers inrespect of air raid precautions, but which would bemore closely defined in the Bill.     There were two reasons why he asked for this authority at the presenttime.       The first was that it would be necessary tohave discussions with representative bodies of employersbefore the Bill was introduced.     These disoussionswould necessarily involve the financial assistance to
be afforded by the Exchequer.     The second reason wasthat many employers who knew the extent of their obligations, were holding back because they did not knowhow they stood financially in the matter.made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the 18th March,1938, a copy of which was appended to his Memorandum.The concession promised in this statement, however, didnot apply to expenditure which was of a capital nature.The industrial Panel were of opinion that the financialassistance to be afforded in respect of capitalexpenditure should be equivalent to an Income Tax remission.He appreciated, however, the extreme difficulty from the inland Revenue point of view of allowing a deduction for income Tax purposes in respect of expenditure of a capital nature.      There was the further point that, inhis view, it was impossible to make the concession in a form which was only operative when profits were earned,but which afforded no relief when no profits were earned.His proposal was therefore to make a direct subsidy atthe rate equivalent to the amount of Income Tax relief,and he proposed to inform employers that in respect ofexpenditure incurred in carrying out &apos;good employer&apos;obligations, they would in future receive not merelyIncome Tax relief on expenditure which could be regardedas expenditure which was admissible as a deduction incomputing trading profits for Income Tax under theChancellor&apos;s announcement of the 18th March, 1938, butalso an equivalent contribution in respect of all expenditure falling within the Code, whether or not that expenditure was admissible as a deduction in computingtrading profits for Income Tax purposes.      This proposal was tantamount to a subsidy or grant at the rate of 27-g- per jThe Lord Privy Seal referred to the announcementcento
In reply to a question, the Lord Privy Seal agreedthat the words &quot;at least&quot; nine lines from the bottom ofpage 3 of his Memorandum might he omitted.      The subsidy atthe higher rate of 50 per cent, would only be proposed inregard to certain special cases, e.g. obscuration of blastfurnaces, where the measures involved considerable expenseand were directed, not to the protection of particularpremises, but to the protection of an area of the country asa whole.The Lord Privy Seal drew attention to the factthat, although he was only proposing to impose a specificobligation in respect of industrial establishments in which more than 50 persons were employed, he proposed that thefinancial assistance should be accorded to all employers who carried out the &apos;good employer1 obligations.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER asked whether theemployers in question would be under an obligation to give notice of the work which they were proposing to carry out,and to obtain prior approval.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the work to be carriedout would be specified in the General Code and that thepoint raised by the Chancellor of the Exchequer would bediscussed departmentally with the Treasury.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that theissue involved here was a very large one.     He had reachedthe view that it was necessary that a financial contribution should be made on the s cale proposed.     He thought that theright course was that the Bill should define the assistanceto be given by reference to the amount which would havebeen allowed   had the payments been admissible as deductionsfor Income Tax purposes, Income Tax being taken at therate current at the time the work was done.     He was prepared to agree to a settlement on this basis, subject tothe following conditions:(1)    That the work should be carried oujLwithin a specified period, and begun not later than 1939-40b
(2)    That the work should he limited tovulnerable areas.(3)    That the gross expenditure should belimited to  4 per employee working in the factory or shop.THE LORE PRIVY SEAL indicated that he agreed to these conditions generally, exceptthat he was afraid that in certain cases theexpenditure would exceed  4 per head.    Thismatter was reserved for later discussion.It was agreed that the terms of thestatement to be made by the Lord Privy Sealshould be settled between the Lord Privy Sealand the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Some discussion then ensued in regard tothe proposals for compensation dealt with inparagraph 7 of the Lord Privy Seal*s MemorandumsTHE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that themain point here concerned was his proposal to pay compensation on different bases in respect of(a) buildings designated by local authorities as public air raid shelters or for other A.R.P..purposes in peace-time, and (b) premisesrequisitioned owing to the imminence of anemergency.   After some discussion it was agreedto defer a decision on this matter till a. later stage.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs referred to a school in the west of England, the governors of which had been notified that theschool would be requisitioned by the Government inan emergency.   The Governors, of the school wishedto be satisfied that it was really essential for their school to be requisitioned, and that this- 26 -
course had not been adopted merely because it wasconvenient to the Department concerned.     He thoughtit might be necessary that there should be a review. of the Office of Works proposals for requisitioningpremises in war time.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL undertook to look intothis matter.The Cabinet approved generally the proposals set out in paras. 1 - 6 of the Lord Privy Seal&apos;sMemorandum (CP. 61 (39)), ana in particular -(1) Authorised the Lord Privy Seal tomake a comprehensive statement in the&quot;louse of Commons at an early date,and in advance of publication of theBill, regarding the nature of theobligations to be imposed on industrial and commercial undertakings and thefact that assistance would be forth-coming from the Exchequer, the termsof the statement to be agreed with theChancellor of the Exchequer.(S) Approved generally tAe -oro.nosals that financial assistance should be ev ^?orcLedto Government and industrial under-taking s in respect of expenditure incurred on air raid precautions, bymeans of a grant equal to the amount which would have been allowed had the pay-ments been admissible as deduction for income tax purposes, income tax beingtaken, at the rate current at the time thework is done.(3) Agreed that the concession in (2) shouldnot apply in cases where there is already a provision in the Bill for passing on costs to the tenants of offices.(4-) Agreed that a detailed scheme for financialassistance on the above lines should beelaborated, by the Lord Privy 3eal&apos;s Depart-ment, the Treasury and the Inland RevenueDepartment, in consultation, in the lightof the discussion which had taken place.(5) Agreed that financial assistance should be afforded to industries called upon to incursubstantial expenditure (going beyond thescope of the ordinary good employer&apos;sobligation) in obscuring the glare of blastfurnaces and other continuous processes, andthat financial assistance should be accorded tothose industries under the Bill, subject to conditions to be agreed between the department and the Treasury in respect of each industry,and subject to a maximum of 50 per cent, of the agreed cost.
(6)    Agreed that the question of treatingmeasures of camouflage on the basisproposed in conclusion (5) should befurther explored.(7)   Agreed to defer a decision on theproposals in para. 7 of the Memorandum(compensation) pending consideration ofthe Bill generally by the Cabinet.
(Previousrandura by the Lord Privy Seal (II. A.-9 (39)), coveringReference:Cabinet 9(39), Con-elusion 7).and facilitate the construction, maintenance andthe draft CampsBill, which was designed to promotemanagement of permanent camps for the use of the civilpopulation.     The conclusions of the Committee of HomeAffairs thereon (H.A.C. 5th Conclusions (39)), were as follows:-&quot;(1) To reserve for determination by. theCabinet the question whether the provisoto Section 1 (3) of the Bill should standor should be deleted.      Should the cabinet decide to delete the proviso it would thenbe for consideration whether there shouldbe included in the Defence Loans Bill or some other Bill a provision enabling moneyto be borrowed for the purposes of providingcamps for the civil population.(2) To recommend the Cabinet, subject to (l)above, to authorise the introduction forthwith in the House of Commons of the camps Bill, in the form of the draft annexed to H.A.-9 (59), subject to the alterations mentioned in the discussion and subject to any drafting or other minor amendments that may be found necessary or desirable.&quot;THE LORD PRIVY SEAL explained that the onlyoutstanding point v/as the inclusion in the bill of a financial limit.      He did not v/ish to adopta controversial attitude on a matter on which theChancellor of the Exchequer had been most helpful.He pointed out, hov/ever, that the provision of funds for the Bill v/as dependent upon -(a) The consent of the Treasury.(b) The voting of moneys by Parliament.   ,He therefore regarded the question whether there should be a financial limit of  1,200,000on the sum of the grants made and on thetotal amounts outstanding in respect of
principal of any loans made under the Bill, as a questionof presentation rather than of substance.     He also pointedout that the announcement already made was to the effect thatwe were to make a beginning with the provision of camps,and did not include any reference to a specific financiallimitation.     In discussion a number of Ministers supported this view.     Reference was made to the financial limitationin the Special Areas Act, which had given rise to a gooddeal of misapprehension.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER reminded his colleagues that the original scheme had been for the construction of200 camps at an estimated cost of  4 millions.      This scheme had been referred back for consideration by the Lord privy seal and himself, with a view to the submission of a more modest scheme.     A revised proposal for the erection of 50camps at an estimated cost of  1 million had been approvedby the Cabinet.     He distrusted the argument that, if no limit were included in the Bill, the Treasury would never-theless have the determining voice.     In actual fact, hewould be subject to pressure from all quarters to spendfurther sums.     Even at the present day the expenditure of^ 1 million v/as no mean sum.     If there was no limit in thescheme, the Bill would cease to be an experimental matter,and there was a risk that we should rapidly find ourselvesinvolved in a very large scheme.     Further, even if no limit v/as mentioned in the Bill, some limit must be includedin the financial Memorandum.     He regretted therefore that he did not see his way to agree to the proposalth.t a financial limit should be omitted from theAct.
THE FOREIGN SECRETARY  said that the Cabinet hadtaken a clear decision on this matter, and lie hopedthat his colleagues generally would accept theChancellor&apos;s view.THE PRIME MINISTER  said that after the decision reached by the Cabinet he thought that it was verydifficult to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer to agreeto the deletion of the financial limit from the Act.The Cabinet agreed:-(1) That the proviso to Section I (5)of the Bill, limiting to  1,200,000,the sum of the grants made under theSection and of the amounts outstandingin respect of the principal of anyloan made thereunder, should stand.(2) To accept the recommendation of theHome Affairs Committee as to theintroduction of the Bill forthwith inthe House of Commonso
0B COTTON 9. THE CABINET had under consideration a Memo-KDUSTRY .    . ,jjE-ORGANISATION)randum &quot;by.the President of the Board of Trade (CP.-60(59))in which he recalled that at the Meeting referredpreviousReference: to in the margin he had been authorised to publish aCabinet 60[38), Con- White Paper (Cmd. 5935)  containing the clauses of ailusion 14,)Draft Bill, based substantially upon the proposalsof the Joint Committee of the Cotton Trade Organisa-tions, for the re-organisation of the cotton industry,together with a short explanatory memorandum.    Copies ofthis White Paper had been sent to all producing firms inthe industry, together with a &quot; allot paper on which theywere asked to record their votes either for or againstthe introduction in Parliament of a. Bill on the lines proposed.    In addition, the three Chambers of commerce and the three Trade Unions chiefly concerned had been invited to express the views of their organisations.    Inthe result the President thought that the support shownwas sufficient to warrant the introduction of a Bill, inspite of opposition from the merchanting interests.   he therefore sought authority (1) to announce that theGovernment had decided to introduce the Bill forthwith!(S) to invite the merchanting interests to consider what further safeguards they regarded as essential for their protection;    (3) to circulate the Billto the Committee of Home Affairs for consideration at their next Meeting and to introduce it immediatelyit had received their approval, without further referenceto the Cabinet.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE said thatthere was clearly a marked divergence of view betweenthe producers and the merchanting interests.   as this was a Bill concerned with the producing
interests he had no hesitation in recommending hiscolleagues to go forward with the Billo    They mightanticipate some opposition in the House from themerchanting interests, and it might he necessaryto introduce further safeguards to protect them*a further point had arisen since his Memorandumhafl. been drafted, namely, the position of NorthernIreland,   The cotton interests in Northern Ireland; Piwere negligible, and formed an adjunct of the linenindustry.    It had always been assumed that, although there was no power to include Northern Ireland in theBill, Northern Ireland would v/ish to be included.Northern Ireland had now, however, stated that she did notfcwish to be included in the Bill,    This would have certain repercussions on Scotland, since there were anumber of firms in Scotland which wcro in direct competition with firms in Ulster and who would like to be excluded from the Bill.    He proposed that the Bill,as presented to Parliament,should exclude NorthernIreland, but that Northern Ireland, should be includedat a later stage if agreement on the point could be reached.Failing agreement, it would be necessary to see what steps could be taken to meet the Scottish interests.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR SCOTLAND reminded his colleagues that he had mentioned this matterwhen the Bill was discussed some months ago.    Thenegotiations with the Scottish interests had alwaysproceeded on the basis that Northern Ireland, wouldbe included, and he anticipated difficulties if theBill, as introduced, excluded Northern Irelandbut included Scotland,,   The point was likely to be strongly argued, and he hoped that it would be possible to take steps to meet the position^
To approve the steps proposed by thePresident of the Board of Trade inhis Memorandum (CP.-60 (39)) as summarised above,  including animmediate announcement that theGovernment had decided tointroduce the Bill forthwith;subject to the understanding thatthe President of the Board of trade should take such action as waspossible to meet the difficulties arising out of the position ofNorthern Ireland and Scottishinterests.
JSCB^employment 10o     The Cabinet had under consideration aINSURANCE FUND.f --- Memorandum by the Minister of Labour (Co P. 58 (39))FinancialPosition of. covering proof copies of the Annual Report of theAnnual Report Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee on theof StatutoryCommittee. Financial Condition of the General Account of theUnemployment Fund on the 31st December, 1958, and a(previous references: similar Report in respect of the Agricultural AccountCabinet 10 (3/5)Conclusion 13, of the Fund,and Cabinet 8 (39)Conclusion 9.) According to this Report,  the balance ofthe General Account stood at  45,954 j, 000, the bulkof which would be required as a Reserve,     Never-theless, there remained a surplus of  5,100,000 for distribution by further improvements of the scheme,provided the liabilities remained the same.     TheCommittee pointed out, however, that their estimates of the income and expenditure of the General account would be affected in future years by recent orprospective changes in the Unemployment InsuranceScheme.      In the circumstances outlined ih theirReport the Committee proposed that  3 millions of thesurplus should be used to discharge part of the debt of the Fund, which at present stood at  81,530,000,with a resultant saving of  150,000 in the annualdebt charge, and: recommended no changes in theGeneral Scheme,The balance of the Agricultural Accounts-toodat  2,774,000, and the Committee recommendedcertain reductions in the existing rates ofcontributions, and increases in the weekly rates ofbenefit, with a view to making the Account not morethan reasonably sufficient.
Subject to the Chancellor of the Exchequersconcurrence, the Minister proposed to adopt theCommittee&apos;s recommendations, which were unanimous inrespect of both Reports, and to take the necessary action for giving effect to those regarding theAgricultural Scheme by affirmative Resolutions of bothHouses.     Parliamentary approval was not required forthe recommendation to pay off  3 millions of debt.The Cabinet approved these proposals.
