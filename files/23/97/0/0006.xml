THE CABINET. 1.      THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was sure his colleagues would wish to join with him(previous reference: in offering a very cordial welcome to the new cabinet 6 (39JConclusion 1.) Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.
X J iTHE UNITEDSTATES of America.(previous reference:Cabinet 3(39), Con-clusion 2.)2.      THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that two or three days ago he had received an unofficial telephone message from the private secretary to the American Ambassador to the effectthat everything was going along finely in theUnited States, and urging that it was undesirable that any public statement should be made in thiscountry as to Mr. Roosevelt&apos;s recent utterancebefore the Senate Committee on Military Affairs.
CHINA.FinancialAssistanceto.(previous reference:Cabinet 3(39), Con-clusion 3)0EconomicRetaliation.ChineseCurrencyStabilisa-tion Loan.3o      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that a telegram (No. 59 of 4th February) had beenreceived from Washington to the effect that the UnitedStates Government shared the point of view expressedby H.H. Government, namely, that a policy of assistanceto China was preferable at the present time to one of taking any measures of retaliation against Japan.On the Currency question, a telegram (No. 60 of 4th February) had been received from Washington statingthat the United States Government hoped to be able togive an answer this week to our request that we mightbe furnished with information as to the parallel actionwhich the United States Government hoped to take in theevent of our deciding to proceed with the CurrencyStabilisation Loan proposals.The Foreign Secretary added that there was one aspect of this matter on which it would probably benecessary for him to consult the Cabinet.     On the25th January the Cabinet had decided that instructions should be sent to our Ambassador in China to tellGeneral Chiang Kai-shek that II.M. Government were considering the question of guaranteeing a contribu-tion to a currency stabilisation fund, but that their decision in the matter had been made more difficult by the attitude of the Chinese Government in stoppingpayment of interest on foreign loans secured on theChinese Customs.    (Cabinet 2 (39) Conclusion 3)The Ambassador had replied (Telegram 1 Tour of1st February) saying that before acting on the aboveinstructions he would be glad to know whether it was theintention of H.M.. Government to make the implementingof the Customs agreement a condition of any contributionto the currency stabilisation fund, and had added that
he -had misgivings about the wisdom of this..     SirA. Clark Kerr had been informed in reply, on the3rd February,  (Telegram 7 Tour) that H.M. Governmenthad not arrived at any definite decision as to a currencyLoan, and that it was therefore impossible to say whether the acceptance of the Customs arrangement would or would not b e a condition of any such loan,if made.      Sir A. Clark Kerr&apos;s further observationsbefore saying anything to the Chinese Government had been requested and were being awaited.The Chinese Government had always been strongly opposed to the carrying out of the Anglo-JapaneseCustoms arrangement, on the ground that if they did so they v/ould be accused by their own people ofhanding over Chinese money to their enemies, theJapanese.     Our view v/as that the Chinese Governmentstood to benefit on balance from the arrangement, butthe Chinese Prime Minister, Dr0 Kung, stronglymaintained his objection from the internal political point of view.The Foreign Secretary added that the question would come up in connection with the Chinese- currencystabilisation scheme, but meanwhile a decision couldbe deferred pending Sir A. Clark Kerr&apos;s furtherobservations.     The United States Government had also made a suggestion that the Japanese Government shouldbe asked to assume some responsibility for theservice of the loans secured on the Customs, andthis suggestion was at present under examination.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER observed thatif we decided to proceed with the Chinese currencystabilisation scheme, it would be necessary tointroduce legislation, and the Government were therefore liable to be asked questions in regard to-4-
i* \j vrelated topics, as, for example, the payment ofinterest on foreign Loans secured on the ChineseCustoms.The Cabinet took note of the above statement by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.
read to the Cabinet a telegram which had been receivedfrom our Ambassador in Paris in regard to the positionin Spain, and the possible recognition of general franco.    The Foreign Secretary also read out a tenta-tive reply to this telegram which had been draftedand which he proposed should be considered by theForeign Policy Committee. (This telegram (Ho. 41) hadnot been circulated.      A copy of the telegram and of the,draft reply is filed on the Secretary&apos;s standard copyof Cabinet Conclusions.)The Foreign Secretary said that his mind on thismatter was governmd by three main considerations:firstly, would the fighting continue;   secondly, theconstitutional position - was there still a SpanishGovernment;    thirdly, the political reactions inthis country.   He thought it was clear that general franco was qoxriz to win the war, and he thought thatthe sooner this country got on terms with general franco and made up lost ground the better.    He alsoalluded to a suggestion which had been m^de that theBritish Council should start propaganda activities inFranco Spain, and explained that it had beefr found impossible to adopt this course while fighting was still continuing.The Foreign Secretary said that he had come tothe tentative conclusion that the attitude which theFrench Government wished to adopt, namely, to agreeto recognise General Franco on certain specifiedconditions, one of which was that foreign troops should first all be removed from Spain, was not sound.For one thing, action on these lines would put. it in-6-
f n 9the power of 2,00:0 German or Italian troops to hold upindefinitely the recognition by this country of GeneralFranco1s Government.   It was clear that General Franco him-self wished to be rid of foreign troops as soon as possible,and he thought that recognition by us would be helpful tohim in this matter.In the course of the discussion which ensued, th following points were made:First, that it was probably now too late to attemptto do a deal with General Franco on the basis of granting1him belligerent rights if foreign troops were withdrawh  fromNationalist Spain.Secondly, it would be necessary to examine ca^SfUllywhether we had given any public undertakings that we would only recognise Nationalist Spain on certain conditions.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY thought that any assurances .that had been given would cease to be operative if Govern-&apos;ment Spain ceased to exist as an effective organised unit..Thirdly * should the fall of Madrid, if it took place,justify us in recognising Nationalist Spain?In this connection THE SECRETARY OF STATE PURDOMINION AFFAIRS mentioned that the Eire Government were proposing to tell their representative at St. Jean de Luz ina few days1 time that if Madrid was captured they wouldthen recognise the Nationalist Government and has asked forthe views of the Foreign Secretary on this proposal..On the other hand, the view was expressed that thefall of Madrid might not in itself constitute a suitablecriterion on which to base recognition.    Recognition ofGeneral Franco1s Government by this country would mean thatthe Government troops were regarded as rebels and it was difficult to say how this course could be adopted while anysubstantial resistance continued.In reply to these points, THE FOREIGN SECRETARY saidthat he was afraid that we might drift into a position inwhich guerrilla warfare continued for a considerable time without any marked change in the situation.He thought it was desirable that we
should get some value out of recognising General^ Franco-,,and should not find ourselves in the same sort of difficulty that we had encountered over the recognitionof Italian sovereignty over Ethiopia..     There had, infact, recently &quot;been some risk that the French Governmentwould take immediate action to recognise General Francowithout consulting us, hut they had now agreed not to actwithout prior   consultation0THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that one possible argument against immediate recognition was that information had been received that some 60 per cent of thepeople of Valencia were anxious to give up the struggleand to arrange a surrender as had been suggested atMinorca (see below).      Once we had recognised general franco, our intervention in the matter was less likely tobe effective.On the suggestion of the Prime Minister, theCabinet agreed that it was not necessary to reach any formal conclusion on this matter. If, however, thereshould be so substantial an alteration in the position that the facts would justify us in recognising general franco&apos;s Government, we should be glad of the opportunityof doing so.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat he concurred in this suggestion.     He agreed it wouldbe desirable to avoid attaching too precise a significanceto the fall of Madrid.     He hoped that the Cabinet wouldalso agree to the general, conclusion   that the recognitionof General Franco&apos;s Government should not be made subjectto a number of specific conditions on the lines proposed bythe French Government.The Cabinet concurred in these suggestions;and agreed that the draft reply to our ambassador in Paris    in re-gard to the Spanishposition   should be considered by the ForeignPolicy Committee.
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs referred to telegrams which, had been received setting out the course of events in regard to proposals toarrange for the surrender of Minorca to the nationalist government,     A Nationalist Officer had asked to betaken on a British Destroyer to Port Mahon to arrangeterms for surrender.     HoM. Consul at Port Mahon had replied that this was not possible unless general franco&apos;s authority had been obtainedo     This had beendone.At first, the Foreign Office had thoughtthat there were considerable objections to thissuggestion but, after full consideration, we had agreedto an intermediary of the Nationalist Go &apos;;rnment being-brought to Minorca on one of H.M. Ships subject to various safeguards.      Thus we have received assurances that no Germans or Italians would be allowed toparticipate in the occupation of the island, and itwas clear that the proposed surrender would avoidbloodshed.A telegram had. been received on 7th Februaryfrom the Senior Naval Officer, Eastern Area,Mediterranean, reporting that he had brought theNationalist representative to Port Mahon.     A meeting-had been arranged between this representative and theGovernor of MinorcaQ     The Governor had reported thathe could not reach a decision without consulting theSpanish Government, anti the result of the negotiationswas not yet known.The Cabinet took note of the above-o
He-&apos;ations with.reviousef erence:cabinet (39)conclusion i.5.    THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR SCOTLAND asked forinformation about recent Italian troop movementsthrough Libya.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs referred to the telegram which he had despatched to rome (No.  60) and the reply received from Earl Perth(No. 77) from Italy,    Count Ciano had explained thatthere were at present some 30,000 to 32,000 italian troops in Libya and that the Italians intended to send a further 30,000,    This increase was attributed to thelarge number of French forces recently sent to Tunisfrom Morocco.Reference was also made to a recent telegramfrom our Consul at Harrar (No. 8) in Y/hich it was statedthat the eastward movement of troops had ceased and thatthe situation had greatly eased.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE askedwhether the Foreign Secretary had obtained any satisfactory explanation of the rumours as to trafficover the Brenner Pass.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he would consider making enquiries on this matter from our ambassador in Rome.
r- f\ nliTERl^TlONALMATION.losition in[[je event ofGermanInvasion oflolland orSwitzerland.a translation of a reply which had been received from theFrench Government to the diplomatic approach which hadbeen made to them referring to the disturbing rumourswhich were circulating in regard to a possible german invasion of Holland,   The Foreign Secretary also read outre &quot;)  &apos; &apos;%t&amp;q draft of an answer which had been prepared, but whichwas not in final form.    (Note - Copies of these two documents are on record in the Secretary&apos;s standard file of Cabinet Minutes.)He proposed that this draft should be brought before the Foreign Policy Committee.   In this reply he proposed to take the line, first that we welcomed theattitude adopted by the French Government in regard to holland:    secondly that if Germany invaded Switzerland,and France on that account declared war on Germany, weshould regard the German invasion of Switzerland as acasus belli.   Thirdly he proposed to ignore the suggestion in regard to conscription,   M. Corbin had informed him that he regretted its inclusion in the French reply.Some discussion took place as to the meaning of the words&quot;joint action of a preventive character&quot;, in the Frenchreply.   It was suggested that the underlying thought wasthat, if Germany invaded Holland, It would be necessaryfor the French, like ourselves, to take immediate action,since a German occupation of Holland would constitute a direct threat to French (and our) security.
The Secretary of---Sta-te^,for Foreign affairs said that two telegrams had been sent- t-o -the UnitedStates for the personal and secret information ofthe President, indicating our attitude on thismatter (Nos. 64 and 65), and giving an indication of the replies of the French and Belgian governments and some indication of the Dutch attitude.        Inthe drafting of the former telegram one pointhad emerged which had not perhaps been quite clear at previous discussions, namely that the questionof Dutch resistance to invasion was not perhapsof first rate importance, for two reasons: firstthat in any case the Dutch would be unable to put up an effective resistance, and secondly that theoccupation of Holland by Germany constituted a threat to the security of the Western Powers.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS saidthat he thought that nevertheless every effort should be made to ensure effective assistance fromthe Swiss and Dutch in the event of invasion oftheir territories.     It was also pointed out that public opinion here might be considerably affectedby the question whether the Dutch resisted invasion.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought theDutch would be more likely to put up a resistanceif they knew that we would support them.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF defence said that-Germany could have no motive for Qccupy-ing Holland except in order to improve herstrategic position in Northern Europe. Similarlyshe could have no motive in attacking Switzerland,
except to improve her strategic position against france,      it was clear that a German occupation of either country constituted a direct threat to theWestern Powers.VTHE FOREIGN SECRETARY referred to a suggestion which had &quot;been made at the   meeting of the Foreign36)56th Policy Committee, noted in the margin, that apage 19.statement should be prepared for possible publicationindicating the line which this country would adopt inthe event of a German invasion of Holland.     TheForeign Secretary said that he was preparing a draft,but his inclination was to keep it available for useat some possible future occasion, but to make no public statement on these lines at the moment.In reply to a question by the Minister ofLabour, the Foreign Secretary explained that thereason why the reply from the French Government whichhe had read out had been communicated by them to theBelgian Government was that in making our approach to the French Government, we&apos;had informed them thatwe were making a similar approach to the BelgianGovernment.     The Foreign Secretary added that the replies we had received from the Belgian Governmentwere not altogether helpful.In reply to a further question.by the Ministerof Labour the Foreign Secretary said that no furtherinformation had been received which would confirm the earlier rumours as to possible german intentions to attack in. the West.     Indeed, therelative quietness of the atmosphere was regarded
by some people as an ominous symptoms   He himself thoughtthat President Roosevelt&apos;s recent pronouncement,synchronising with the Prime Minister&apos;s speech in theHouse of Commons had had a very valuable effect.The Cabinet agreed that the draft reply to the French Government shouldbe considered by the Foreign PolicyCommitteeo
o 4 f\INTER- - fT        The Cabinet had before them a Most SecretLtionalllTUATION. Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (C.P.-40taff Con- (39)), circulated by authority of the Prime Ministerersationsith Prance and prepared in accordance with the Conclusionnd Belgium,mentioned in the margin, on the subject of StaffipreviousiReference: Conversations with France and Belgium,     The recom-Oabinet 3(39), Con- mendations of the Chiefs of staff may briefly besummarised as follows:-elusion 5(n). )(1) That the Conversations on our side shouldbe carried out on the level of the membersof the Joint Planning Sub-Committee, andthat the French should be invited to send representatives of approximately similarstandingo(2) That the Conversations should be carriedon in London0(3) That the Conversations should cover allpossible theatres of war in which joint action or&apos;operations by ourselves and theFrench are possible.(4) That the Conversations should be conducted in stages:-(i) to discuss with the French our generalstrategical conception of a war inwhich we are engaged as allies againstGermany and Italy, and then to invitethe French to inform us of their appreciation:(ii) that the Joint Planning Sub-Committeeshould discuss broad outline plans inthe several theatres of operations:(iii) preparation by each of th^.Services of detailed joint plans with the French.(5) That on the conclusion of stage (i) abovethe Chiefs-of staff would report to theCabinet.(6) That the Chiefs of Staff should have authorityto impart to the French such information as.    to our plans and resources (other thancertain technical details) as is necessaryto ensure co-ordination in peace and efficient-ent co-operation in war.(7) That general agreement should be reached with the French before bringing in the belgians.(8) That Conversations with the Dutch shouldtake place at a later stage.
91 ih) X. -LPreviousReference:Cabinet 5(59),conclusion (I)).THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP defence said that he agreed with the proposals made &quot;by theChiefs of Staff, which he thought carried out theCabinet&apos;s intentions.    As regards conversations withthe French, the Chiefs of Staff thought that they  ,should be conducted on a level which could reasonably be regarded as a continuation of the contactsestablished after the London Agreement of 1936,and openly continued since that date.     In replyto the Foreign Secretary, he agreed that the possibilityof conversations between the Chiefs of Staff was not excluded.     Indeed, it was contemplated that such conversations should take place at a later1 date.In regard to paragraph 6, the ministers aid that at the meeting of the Cabinet mentionedin the margin, the view had been taken that japan was likely to adopt a somewhat cautious attitude,at any rate at the outset of any emergency in thenear future.     He pointed out that Japan couldembarrass us, not mex^ely by active intervention,but also by making a strategic disposition of herforces which would constitute a severe threat toAustralia and India,      If she did this, we shouldbe confronted with a difficult problem and weshould have to make corresponding moves.     Hethought that this was one of the contingenciesagainst which plans would have to be prepared.In regard to Belgium, the SECRETARY OF STATEFOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS explained that we had had some close and secret contacts with the BelgianGeneral Staff.     The French had had no such contactsand the Belgians were unlikely to agree to haveStaff contacts with the French in the near future.- 16 -
^ i- 9j&amp; i- iwIt was clear therefore thatx tJii^aJ2i^4ui^lsaaussio^were for trie moment out of the question.     Hethought that the only action which need he taken atthe present stage vis-a-vis Belgium was that weshould inform the Belgians that we were discussingmatters with the French, and that we hoped to havecontacts with them (the Belgians) at a later stage.In regard to the Dutch, it was generally agreed that there was no object in initiatingconversations at the present time, and that,  if anyconversations took place, it should be at a later stage.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs referred to the question of conversations on the(Previous supply side,      THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADEReference:Cabinet 31 said that on the authority given by the Gabinet at(38), Con-clusion 9, the meeting referred to in the margin discussions in regard to coal were proceedingoTHE FOREIGN SECRETARY thought that it was desirable that joint discussions on economic warfare should take place, and it was agreed that*as the first step, the Foreign Office should raise the matter with the Advisory Committee on trade Questions in Time of War. of the Committeeof Imperial Defence, with a view to joint discussions taking place between representativesof that Sub-Committee and of the correspondingFrench organisation.
The Cabinet agreed:-(2) To approve the procedure recommended in the Chiefs of Staff Report (CP. 40(39)), and summarised above,,(2) That Staff Conversations should begin assoon as the European Appreciation referredto in paragraph 7 of that Report hadreceived Ministerial approval,,(3) That the attention of the Chiefs of staff should be drawn to the need for plans to counter a strategic disposition by-Japan of her forces,so as   to threatenIndia and/or Australia,,(4) That the Foreign Secretary should raisewith the Advisory Committee on trade questions in Time of War, the questionof joint discussions with the French inregard to Economic Warfare.
.SSTIHE. 8.    THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES said thaiLondon the Conferences with the Jews and&apos; $he Arabs had opened6.the previous day.    The atmosphere at the openingreviouseference:        meetings had been pleasant enough but behind the scenesCabinet 3 (39)Conclusion 6) . there had been considerable difficulties on the Arab side.EFjC2&apos;^) ^ -    Although two or three times they had been on the vergeof agreement, no agreement had been reached which wouldresult in a united delegation of Palestine Arabs.   TheSecretary of State for the Colonies,said it was common ground that Ragheb Nashashibi should be the first delegateof the Palestine Defence Party.    The dispute was nownarrowed down to a personal issue, namely, who was to bethe second delegate of the Palestine Defence Party.Although the Mufti1s Party had made considerableconcessions, they had adopted an utterly unreasonableattitude in insisting that the second representative ofthe Palestine Defence Party should be   Yakoub Farraj.The Palestine Defence Party wished the second delegate to be Shliman Bey Tongan0 ,The representatives of Egypt^and Saudi Arabiahad been very helpful in trying to overcome these difficulties.   He (the Colonial Secretary) had taken upthe attitude that we were entirely impartial, and were offering our good services with a view to bringing aboutagreement.   We had undertaken to negotiate with two separate delegations of Palestine Arabs, if they wouldnot agree to come in a single delegation.   There was some risk, however, that if we entered into negotiations with alarge separate delegation of the Palestine Defence Party
n ,1 ca 10the delegation of the Mufti&apos;s Party might cease to take any part in the conference a strong reason for striving to bring about asingle delegation of Palestine Arabs was that it would strengthen&apos;the cause of the moderates, and would preventthe two delegations from bidding against each other.The Secretary of State for the Colonies addedthat he was proposing to   see the delegates again that afternoon, and later they were to see the Prime Minister.He hoped that this dispute would then be brought to a conclusion.   He and his colleagues were to meet the Jewishdelegation at 8 o&apos;clock that night.   Pie hoped that theopening statements of the delegation wovCLC. be disposedof before the week-end, and that it would then bepossible to get to grips with the essential issues.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was sxire hiscolleagues would be glad to feel they could rely onthe inexhaustible patience of the Colonial Secretary inthese most difficult negotiations,,
?BNCB LOANS BILL. 9. THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER referredto the statement which he had made at the lastprevious Reference; meeting of the Cabinet in regard to the need for cabinet 5(3^)Conclusion 3). increasing our borrov/ing powers in respect of theDefence programme.     Broadly the position was asfollows.     At the end of the current financial yearpdly  200 million would remain out of the 400 million for which borrowing powers had beentaken in 1957.     This sum would not suffice tocover the borrov/ing necessary in defence estimates in the coming financial year5 since those Estimates,,after taking into consideration Air Raid PrecautionsServices9would amount to  550 millions.     assuming that the revenue available in the next financialyear was the same as was estimated to be availablein the current year, it would be necessary to borrow some  280 millions.Under the Defence Loans Act of 1937 theGovernment had power to borrow in all up to  400millions during the period ending March, 1942.The Chancellor said that he proposed to ask forborrowing powers for another  400 millions.     Hewould then have in hand a balance of  600 millionsat the end of the financial year now closing.     he hoped that this sum would carry him through thefinancial year 1939-40, and also through 1940-413but he was doubtful whether this would prove to bethe case..    He feared that further borrowing powers would be required to cover the first four years ofthe quinquenium covered by the Defence Loans Act 1937,The Chancellor added that he proposed alsoto take powers on the Bill to apply the new borrowing powers not only to the votes of the Defence Departments,
fa 2. 5as hitherto, but also to the votes for Air RaidPrecautions and the purchases of food and commoditiesauthorised under the Essential Commodities ReservesAct.     He thought that on merits this course was notonly justified but prudent.     If for any reason it wassuddenly decided, at short notice, to spend large sumson this service in the course of any financial year?the Budget of the year would be thrown out of gearin the absence of power to borrow.The Chancellor also asked for the authority ofthe Cabinet to send the draft bill to the Home AffairsCommittee on Monday^ I3th February and to introduce iton ?/wednesday 15th.     This was necessary underconstitutional usage, so that the Bill should beintroduced before the Defence Estimates were presented.The Chancellor added that it would be necessaryto issue a Statement relating to Defence in the formof a Parliamentary White Paper.     A draft had alreadybeen prepared and had been considered by a Meeting ofMinisters.     Proofs of the draft as revised by ministers were available and would be circulated to the Cabinetthat afternoon.     He suggested that members of theCabinet should be invited to send their comments onthe draft to the Secretary by not later than Thursdayevening, for consideration by a further Meeting of the ministerial Drafting&quot;Committee,which would&apos;be held onFriday morning.The Chancellor added that he proposed that theWhite Paper should be issued on Wednesday, 15thFebruary, and that the Debate which would take place inthe ensuing week on the Money Resolution required forthe Defence Loans Bill should also deal with the white paper.     It would thus become a general Defence Debate.
THE PRIME MINISTER said he thought it was desirable that the White Paper should deal inconsiderable detail with the strengthening of the regional staff of the Air Raid Precautions Department..THE LORD PRIVY SEAL undertook to consider anamplification of the draft to deal with this matter.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OF-TRADE said thata Committee was now considering the question of the storage, not only of food reserves, but of raw materialson a very large scale.    It had been suggested by theTreasury that action on these lines might be desirable in order to avoid the dislocation of the Exchangeswhich might result from having to make very largepurchases in war-time. He thought that consideration should be given to the question whether the powers tobe taken in the new Defence Loans Bill should includepower to borrow for such reserves.THE CHANCELLOR undertook -to consider this point.The Cabinet agreed -(1)    To approve the preparation of a Defence loans bill to give Increased borrowing powers tothe extent of:a further  400 millions;(2)    That power should be taken in the Bill toextend the scope of the services to whichborrowed moneys can be appropriated, in aid,so as to. include Civil Defence;(3)    To authorise the Chancellor of the exchequer to send the draft Bill to the Committee ofHome Affairs on Monday,  13th February, andto introduce it on Wednesday, 15th Februarywithout further reference to the Cabinet;(4)- To take note of the action proposed in&apos; regard to the preparation of a draft white paper on Defence, its presentation onWednesday, 15th February, and thearrangements for a general Defence debate on.the Money Resolution for the DefenceLoans Bill and the White Paper on defence on the 20th and 21st February.
iJ  -!.- oc5THE SOVIET UNION.    10.       The Cabinet had under consideration aCoranercial Note by the President of the Board of Tradegelations with.(CP. 32 (39)) to which he attached a Memorandum,previous reference: prepared by his Department in consultation with cabinet 54(36)* Con- the other Departments primarily concerned, on the elusion 8.)subject of our Commercial Relations with Russia.This Memorandum set out briefly the essentialpoints to be borne in mind in considering thequestion of approaching the Russian Governmentwith a view to the improvement of the present unsatisfactory position,.      The President wasbeing pressed by the United Kingdom trading interests to negotiate a new Trade Agreement.If, in the light of the considerations outlined in his Memorandum, his colleagues agreed that some action should be taken, the procedure would beas follows:-(1) To approach the Soviet Governmentfor a revision of the 1934 TemporaryCommercial agreement(2) If no progress is made in the negotiations,to give notice of denunciation of that agreement.(3) If denunciation should prove ineffective,to bring forward a Bill providing asanction to be employed against soviet trade - the sanction to take the formof a unilateral Clearing0THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP trade said that his proposals were at present in a somewhat indefinite state, but he thought it rightto bring the matter before the Cabinet0     Heindicated some of the reasons which madethe Agreement of 1934 completely unsatisfactoryfrom the point of view of.traders.     Briefly,the Agreement was a Payments Agreement and the
(j .J o.Russians had utilised the stealing resultingfrom sales of Soviet goods in the United kingdom for the purchase, mainly, of re-exports from thiscountry and to a very small degree for the purchaseof goods manufactured here      The position waspartially obscured at the present time by the purchases now being made under the  10 millioncredits made available by the Export Credits GuaranteeAgreement of 1936c     When the effects of this agreement had passed, the position would be that Russia wassetling us  20 millions worth of  Russian goods andwas only purchasing  2 millions of British goods.In regard to shipping, the position was thatthe Russians had maintained the proportion ofBritish ships chartered.      Their total charteringsof foreign ships had, however, fallen substantially,and we were merely maintaining out proportion of arapidly declining totalo     Another objectionablyfeature was the insistence of the Russian state trading Corporation upon our traders concludingcontracts which included provisions for arbitration in Moscow.After consultation with representativesof the traders concerned, he found that they were allin agreement with the view that action   should betaken to improve the position.     This view was shared by those traders who would stand to lose if Russiaceased to buy any goods from this country.
9 91(j C-J -s-THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE, continuing,said that his main reason for bringing this matter before the Cabinet was that it was clear that our negotiations would fail unless we were prepared totake some such step as the institution of a unilateralClearing, which would constitute a considerablesanction against Russian trade.It might be held that the present moment was an unwise one to enter into negotiations withRussia which might lead us into difficulties withthat country.,      It was clear, however, that thenegotiations could be spun out for a considerable time, and there would be no need to threaten drastic action at an early stage in the negotiations.He thought that it might be a wise plan that theSecretary to the Department of Overseas Trade should go to Moscow in the course of a visit to anumber of Baltic States0      The Italians had recentlysent a Mission to Moscow with results favourable to them.THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL saidthat it should be recognised that Russia had carriedout the terms of the Agreement,
THE FOREIGN SECRETARY agreed that the presentposition was very difficult to defend.     At the sametime the Russians had not broken the agreement or behavedunfairly.      It was also clear that we should findgreat difficulty in getting Russia to take moregoods manufactured in this country.     There was however little use in starting negotiations and. having to abandon them.     At the same time it was undesirable to do anything which would worsen our relationswith Russia.     He wondered whether we could adoptanother method of approach to the problem, which might include the offer of some added inducement to Russia.One course would be to make a. permanent trade agreementwith Russia, but in view of our public pledgeswe could not make a permanent trade agreement until we reached some settlement on Russia&apos;s pre-Revolutiondebts.     This brought up the question of the BaringBalances.      The Foreign Office view was that there was a chance of the successful negotiation of a trade agreement if the Russians surrendered their claim to theBaring Balances in full settlement of our claims in respectof Russian Indebtedness to usQ      This would not be avery satisfactory settlement of the question of Russianindebtedness, but he did not think we were likely toobtain any better terms.     He welcomed the suggestion of a visit to Northern Europe, including Moscow^ bythe Secretary to the Department of Overseas Trade, as he did not wish to lose any opportunity ofestablishing closer relations with Russia^
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EMCHS ]UER said that it v/as not altogether clear that it was right to treat as unfair theuse of sterling exchange by Russia to purchase re-exportedgoods.      So far as such goods consisted of tin   which came from Malaya, it might be argued that the result was to enableMalaya to purchase British goods, and that British tradebenefited from such purchases.      Further, we could not allegethat Russia had not fulfilled the Treaty.      He also pointedout that on page 2 of his Memorandum the President of theBoard of Trade contemplated that quite early in the negotia-tions we should indicate that compulsion was the only course open to us.      He doubted the desirability of startingnegotiations, and keeping them running indefinitely, if theycould only reach a satisfactory solution on the lines suggested by the President.As regards the Baring Balances, these amounted to  million, whereas the pre-Revolution debts owing by russia to people in this country amounted to some  250 million.He felt that   a   statement that we had agreed to settleRussian indebtedness by payment of so small a sum would beopen to considerable criticism.      V/hile he did not wish tooffer strong opposition to the proposal to settle the questionof Russian indebtedness in the manner suggested, if thiswould be useful as part of wider negotiations, he wished to warn his colleagues that this was a very thorny subject.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the debts owed to people in this country by Russia comprised a large number of relatively small sums owed to people who were in poorcircumstances, and a small number of very large debts owedto a number of relatively wealthy individuals or bodies.    TheForeign secretary&apos;s proposal was, he thought,  to use theBaring Balances to make payments to the smaller creditors, towhom the loss of these sums was a matter of great moment.The result would of course be that the larger creditors would say that their claims had been sacrificed in order to meetthe claims of other persons.- 28 -
On the wider issues the case put up by tradersand shipowners for the negotiation of a new agreement was formidable.     But there were likewise formidableobjections against the course proposed, which were&apos;summarised on pages 24 and 25 of the memorandum annexed to the President&apos;s Note,      In particular,Soviet Russia would contend that she wanted machinery which we were unable to supply owing to our re-armament programme.      There were also credits outstand-ing, on which Russia could defaults and orders alreadyplaced with manufacturers which she could cancel.Looked at from this point of view, it seemed that we were bound to come to a deadlocks, but he wasnot sure that this was necessarily the case.The President of the Board of Trade had taken&quot;the view that he was unwilling to enter on negotia-tions unless he was certain that he could use a weaponwhich would enforce a conclusion satisfactory for us,In the political sphere he (the Prime Minister) had always adhered strongly to the principle that we shouldnot use a threat, unless we were prepared to back it up.But he was not certain that it was necessary to adhere to this principle strictly in commercial negotiations.He doubted whether it was necessary for the Cabinetto reach a conclusion that day, in the sense that theywere prepared to authorise the Introduction of legis-lationt providing if necessary,  a sanction in the formof a unilateral Clearing.     Notwithstanding this, theSecretary to the Department of Overseas Trade mightbe authorised to use language, judiciously chosen,indicating the courses which we had in mind if we failed to reach a satisfactory agreement in anyother way.
9 9^&amp; tj *jTurning to the question of a debts settlement,the Prime Minister doubted whether there was any possibility of settling the matter except on the basisproposed by the Foreign Secretary,   It was true that russia was now better able financially to afford amore satisfactory settlement, but we had no means offorcing her to agree to such a settlement.   He thought,therefore, that negotiations should, be started on thebasis proposed, but that no conclusion should, be reached in regard to the action that we should, take if we were unable to reach a satisfactory settlement,THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE assumed thatthis did not mean that the Cabinet would decide againstaction on the lines he proposed, and that this matter wouldbe left open,THE PRIME MINISTER agreed.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER pointed out thata debts settlement on the lines proposed would involve an Act of Parliament, and that a tribunal would have tobe set up to investigate the claims of persons in thiscountry.THE MINISTER OP LABOUR referred to the possible effect on Communistic activities in this country ofthe action proposed.   New branches were now springing up,started by a body described as the Unemployed Workers&apos;Movement, which* there was some reason to believe,was financed from Moscow,
The Cabinet agreed -(I) That the Secretary to the Department of overseas Trade should proceed on a tourof Northern Europe, which should includeMoscow:(S) That, in connection with (l) above,steps should be taken to initiatenegotiations with the Soviet union for a revision of the TemporaryCommercial Agreement of 1934:(3) That the scope of the negotiationswith Soviet Russia should includethe possibility of a settlement ofthe Russian debts question on the basisof the acceptance &quot;by Creditors in this-country of the Baring.balances, amountingto  6 millions, in full settlement ofindebtedness of  250 millions:(4) That, for the time being, no decision should be reached by the Cabinet inregard to action on the lines proposed by the President of theBoard of Trade in the event of negotiations for the revision of theAgreement by ordinary methods provingunsuccessful:(5) That, notwithstanding (4) above,the Secretary to the Department of overseas Trade should be authorisedto Indicate the action which thiscountry might be compelled to take in the event of it proving impossibleto negotiate by agreement a revisionof the Temporary Commercial Agreementof 1934-0(6) That the terms of the statement bythe Secretary of the Department&apos; of overseas Trade referred to in (5)above, should be settled by thePrime Minister, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs and thePresident of the Board of Trade,-in consultation,.
o 9 nGAMPS FOR V/AR AND 11PEACE PURPOSES.(previous reference:Cabinet 4(39), Con-elusion i.;In accordance with the   Conclusion referred toin the margin, the Cabinet had before them a joint memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theLord Privy Seal (CP.-57 (39)), submitting a revised scheme of camps for war and peace purposes, within a distance of some 20 or 50 miles of the big industrial centres.    The object in war would be to enable thesecamps to receive some of the adult refugees who mightpour out of the large cities, and provide them with very rough and ready accommodation until more permanent arrangements could be made.    It was contemplated thatthe camps should, in peace-time, accommodate about550 children each.    The aim should be to get the camps ready for occupation by March, 1940, startingwith a programme of 50 such camps.    After dealingwith the organisation and financial aspects of theproposed scheme, it was stated in the Memorandum, that legislation would be necessary on the lines of appendix II of the Report attached to CP.-22(59). &apos;This legislation should be passed by the 1st   April at latest, and it was for consideration whether it shouldbe in the form of a separate Bill or included in theAir   Raid Precautions Bill,THE    CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER outlined themain points in the revised scheme.    The 50 campswhich it was proposed should be completed by,   March,1940 were estimated to cost -about  1 million.    TheChancellor referred to the financial proposals,and said it was proposed that the scheme should beentrusted to a non-profit-making association, whichshould be run on strictly business lines, and thatthe aim should be to pay a good return on half thecapital.
THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that they hoped inmost cases to start with a vacant house as a nucleusand to build hutments radially.    Importance wasattatched to the camps being readily distinguishablefrom military encampments.    He added that repre-sentatives of labour were anxious to see progress made with the scheme for hutments, so as to facilitateevacuation schemes, and that these representativeswished that each colony should be on a modest scale.The Cabinet approved the revised scheme set out in CP.-57 (39).
12.       The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the&quot;draft Agriculture (Amendment)   Bill attached to H..A.-2(39), on which the Committee of Home Affairs had reached the following Conclusions (H.A.C. 2nd Conclusions(39), Minute 3) :-- &apos; : -;&quot; &apos;:; 1&quot;(1)    To recommend the Cabinet to approve the agriculture (Amendment)Bill in the formof the draft annexed to H.A.-2 (39), jjsubject to any drafting or other minor alterations that may be found necessary or desirable:(2)   To reserve for determination by theCabinet the question whether the Billshould be introduced forthwith in theHouse   of Commons with a view to its passage into law by the end of February,1939, or whether the introduction ofthe Bill should be postponed until some progress had been made in the forthcoming discussions between the agriculture ministers and Representatives of theAgricultural Industry.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES saidthat unless   he was to ask the Cabinet to reopen thewhole matter, he saw no alternative but to proceed withthe Bill.   At the same time he realised that the Bill.would give rise to difficulties and would provoke someunfavourable public reactions.     nless, however, the bill was passed by about the end of February, it would beimpossible to make payment of the increased subsidies assoon as possible after the 31st March, as desired.    he explained that he had indicated his proposals in thismatter to the representatives of the farming interests andthat they had not received them at all favourably.   Fromenquiries which had been made it was .shown that of 505barley-growers in Rutland only 17 would benefit under theproposed Bill, and only to the extent of 4s. 3d. an acre.This was because the subsidy could not be paid in respect ofboth barley and wheat.    He hoped, however, that the bill might be accepted as a stop-gap arrangement.
THE CHANCELLOR 03? THE DUCHY OP LANCASTER saidthat his intention had been to have indicated thatit was very unusual to take any action to enable a subsidy to be paid in respect of a year which had already passed.Further, it was intended that the money payable under this bill should go to the most deserving cases.    For therest, the farmers must look to the long-term policy whichwas now being worked out0THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that atthe Meeting on the previous day it was clear thatthe representatives of the farmers had hoped thatthe review of the farming situation which was now being undertaken would cover not merely the long-term policy,but also the Bill now under discussion.In the course of further discussiorrthe view was strongly expressed that the introduction of the Bill at the presenttime would give a false start to the new approach now beingmade to agricultural problems.    It was generally felt thatthe introduction of a Bill on the present lines, if it could possibly be avoided, would be a mistake in presentcircumstances.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER saidthat at a recent Meeting of the Agricultural PolicyCommittee,  it had been generally agreed that proposalsshouldbeworked out whereby a farmer who grew both barley and wheatcould receive subsidy in respect of both crops, but thatthe subsidy in respect of barley would be on a lower scale than that paid to a barley-grower who grew no wheat.It would, no doubt, be helpful if a scheme on these linescould be formulated to deal with the barley crop of 1938.
*&apos;      ft&apos;;   ;THE PRIME MINISTER said that he ratherdeprecated the incorporation in a Bill submitted toParliament to deal with the 1938 barley crop of provisions which would form no part of the new long-term policy.    He asked whether it would not be possible tomake a public announcement now to the effect that, whenthe long-term policy had been decided upon, it would beapplied retrospectively to the barley crop of 1938.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that he didnot, of course, know what proposals on these lines wouldinvolve.&apos;THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR SCOTLAND pointed outthat a solution on the lines proposed might increasehis difficulties in regard to growers of oats in Scotland.The Cabinet agreed:-That the proposals for an increased subsidy in respect of land under oats or barley,contained in the Agriculture (Amendment)Bill, 1939,  should be further consideredby the Agriculture Ministers and theChancellor of the Exchequer in the lightof the discussion which had taken place;and that in the meantime the introductionof the Agriculture (Amendment) Bill, 1959,should be postponed.

From a conversationyesterday with Negrin, Monsieur Henry derives the impression that latter who still pretends that   Government&apos;s victoryis possible, hopes to save desperate situation by helping to bring about a general conflagration.   Monsieur Henryreports that Negrin means to move Government to (grp*undec.) but Monsieur Bonnet does not feel inclined to instruct Monsieur Henry to follow them there, for he feels that even Valencia and Madrid will fall within at most amonth.-1-
Prom unofficial conversations that Monsieur Bonnethas had with Senor Quinones it seems that Franco will nolonger &quot;be content for the future French representative at Burg.cs to have the same rank as oars. Senor Quinonespointed out that ours was sent to Burgos before the fall of Bilbao and that much has happened since; moreover wehave no Ambassador to the other side.Monsieur Bonnet proposes to await the return next week of Monsieur Berard and then consult with us with aview to reaching some agreement as to both our future relations with Franco:    after such agreement MonsieurBonnet will submit proposed procedure to the   FrenchMinisterial Council.Monsieur Bonnet&apos;s present idea is that we should both obtain from General Franco a written undertaking tothe following effect,1.    Evacuation of all foreign volunteers;2.    Independence of Spain will be maintained;3.    Spanish neutrality will be maintained in case ofwar;4.    Co-operation in Morocco.If this can be obtained Monsieur Bonnet thinks wecan contemplate appointment of regularly accrediteddiplomatic representatives to the Government of general franco.Monsieur Bonnet is not even informing his subordin-&apos;ates in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the above asthat is one of many leaky vessels of which he complains.
0&apos;9 HANNEX II.February, 1939.r e. Phipps,The Prime Minister and I have carefully consideredyour telegram No. 41 (of 4th February ) in which youreported a conversation which you had had with the Ministerfor Foreign Affairs on Spain.    We fully recognise how important it is for both Governments to lose no time in placing their relations with the Nationalists on a satis-factory basis.    Indeed His Majesty*s Government haverealised for a long time that this is the surest, if notthe only, way open to us of detaching them from the foreigninfluences by whioh they are at present surrounded.2. We are however doubtful of the wisdom of attachingpolitical conditions to the appointment of diplomatic representatives.    We fear that if this course were adoptedGeneral Franco might reply that the only conditions whichhe could recognise as relevant to the question of de purerecognition are already fulfilled.    In particular, itappears to us most unwise to make the evacuation of all foreign volunteers a prior condition of recognition.   Theresults which followed from linking together the question of belligerent rights with evacuation are not encouragingand by making de jure recognition dependent upon a stipulated-Alation which cannot be fulfilled without the co-operationof the Italian and German Governments the French. Governmentand His Majesty&apos;s Government would dePrive themselves ofthe possibility of deciding the matter solely on the basisof what is in the respective interests of their two countries.
(j 6 oIt might then, for instance, he possible for Germany orItaly to defeat our purpose by maintaining a number of volunteers in Spain for a considerable time despiteGeneral Francois wish to be free of them.As regards the remainder, condition (2) must appearto Spaniards as a self-evident proposition and any demandfor   an assurance on this point would, I fear, be deeplyresented by General Franco.    (3) and (4) are questions offoreign policy which he might well regard as propersubjects for negotiation once his Government is recognised as the Government of.Spain.   But from his point of view suchmatters could hardly form the subject of agreements with governments with whom diplomatic relations have not yetbeen established.For these reasons we trust that the French Govern-raent will not make the question of recognition dependentupon the fulfilment of conditions such as those suggestedby M. Borne tvA decision as to the moment to he chosen forde jure recognition is made more difficult by the present uncertainty both as to the intentions of Dr. Hegrin andas to the military situation.    If the Spanish government decided to surrender, and were thus eliminated, there would presumably be no further reason for delaying recognition ofGeneral Franco.    If on the other hand they continue thestruggle, the question will still have to be decided at what point the change should be made.    The fall of Madridmight afford an opportunity on which His Majesty&apos;s
9 1? Q/*i t5 yGovernment could properly act.    But even &quot;before Madridfalls political or military developments may give rise toother suitable occasions   for action.    These possibilitiesare being examined there ar.J. it would be most helpful toknow the results of the study which, no doubt, is also being made in Paris.   We should be prepared to reach acommon decision at short notice.I shall be glad if you will put these considerationsbefore the Minister for Foreign Affairs and ask for his views.
annexTRANSLATION of Note from French ministry for Foreign Affairs toHis Majesty&apos;s Embassy, Paris,dated 1st February, 1959.In its aide-memoire of 29th January, His Majesty1sEmhassy was so good as to inform the French Governmentof the pre-occupations  jaused to His Majesty&apos;s government by certain reports of e. political and military characterof such a kind as to give rise to apprehensions of anattack by Germany against the V/estern Powers at the endof February.     His Majesty&apos;s Embassy put forward differenthypotheses including the possibility of a more or lesssudden attack, preceded or not by an ultimatum, whichwould be launched by Germany or by the other signatories to the anti-Comintern Pact.With more particular reference to the case of anunprovoked invasion of the Netherlands by Germany, his majesty&apos;s Government consider that in view of the strategic importance of that country and its colonies aGerman attack should be regarded &quot;as a direct threat tothe security of the Western Powers&quot;;    they declare thatthey are &quot;accordingly disposed to think that they wouldhave no choice but to regard a German invasion of Hollandas a casus belli, assuming that Holland resisted invasion&quot;The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has the honour to informHis Majesty&apos;s Embassy that the French Government, fortheirpart, have received reports which cause them similarpreoccupations to those of His Majestyts Government.
&amp; (i i-These reports, although not hitherto confirmed, give, ineffect, grounds for thinking that Germany&apos;s action, first of all directed towards Eastern Europe, might he turnedeither spontaneously, or in support of Italian claims,towards the West, that is to say, towards Great Britain,France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.     Thisevolution, the results of which might he precipitated bythe policy of prestige, the economic and financial crisis,or the colonial demands of tho two totalitarian countries,should be watched with the closest attention.The French Government consider that the risk towhich the Western Powers are thereby exposed is an equalone for all those Powers and must be regarded asindivisible.     They consider that their security would be directly threatened, whatever might be the initialdirection of the German or Italian attack against one ofthem, and it seoms to them impossible to conceive of alocalisation of the conflict which would necessarilyinterest their entire possessions,.     This situationtherefore creates in fact a coioiiunity of risk which mustlogically entail a real solidarity (solidarite de fait)in the face of any unprovoked attack by Germany or Italy?It as on the understanding that this generalconception is fully shared by His Majesty1s Governmentthat the French Government would be able to find themselvesin agreement with His Majesty1s Government in consideringfrom now on as a casus belli the possibility of an invasion of Holland, although this fact in itself doesnot involve any contractual responsibility on the partof France, and although the joint action which she wouldhave to take in opposition to it, by the side of GreatBritain, would futhermore be of a preventive character..
cp a 0)fa u2&apos;On the other hand?, the French Government would like to be assured that an invasion of Switzerland, as well as an invasion of Belgium, constituting as it would similarlya direct threat to the security of the Western Powers,would be, on the same grounds as an invasion of Holland,considered henceforward is being of a nature to justifyand determine the decisi n contemplated by His Majesty!sGovernment .Finally, the British memorandum adds that HisMajesty&apos;s Government, having carefully considered thesituation in the light of the reports received, &quot;havedecided to accelerate as :.ar as possible the preparationof their defensive and counter-o:Tensive measures&quot;.The French Government, who are to-day making aconsiderable effort in every domain in order to increase-and perfect their armaments, are relighted with thisdecision, the execution of which constitutes in thepresent circumstances a particularly important guarantee of the common security of Western Purope.     The gravity of the situation, in vie?/ of the throats described in theBritish memorandum, demands on the part of all the in- *interested nations the immediate and unreserved adoption ofevery measure liable to increase the human and materialforces already at their disposal.     The French Government,for their part, are ready for this conramity of efforts and sacrifices which, corresponding with a realcommunity of responsibilities, will give Franco-Britishcollaboration its full material and moral efficacy.From this double point of view, recourse to conscriptionappears an essential element of the effective partici-pation of Great Britain in the organisation of common defence on the continent.
The ahove considerations have been brought, asa secret communication, to the knowledge of the BelgianGovernment, as a sequel to His Majesty^s Government^communication of 29th January.
ANNEX IV.w.s.SECRET.x-&apos;eb ruar y , 1939.iSir E. Phipps.Paris.lypherId.russelBe Hagueerlinlerneloraegervice Depts.with memo,under reftly.1Your despatch No. 146 (of 1st February:memorandum from the French Government on Anglo-Frenchsolidarity).1. His Majesty1s Government in the United kingdom have now given consideration to the memorandum from theFrench Government dated 1st February enclosed in yourdespatch under reference.2.        His Majesty1s Government wish to take this oppor-tunity, as promised in paragraph 14 of my telegram No. 18,to inform the French Government of the conclusion which,after due consideration, they have reached as regardsthe attitude they would adopt in the event of hostile action by Germany against the Netherlands.     Theyconfirm that in their view the strategical importanceof the Netherlands and the Netherlands colonies is so great that a German attack on the Netherlands must beregarded as a direct threat to the security of theWestern Powers, and they consider that in the event of aGerman invasion of the Netherlands the United kingdom would be obliged to go to war with Germany.     In additionHis Majestyrs Government consider that any attempt byGermany to dominate the Netherlands by force or threat of force would also have to be regarded as a.menace tothe security-of the United Kingdom-
O -13. His Majesty&apos;s Government are glad to note thatthe French Government would, subject to one observationto which I will refer later, -find themselves in agreementwith His Majesty&apos;s Government in considering an invasion of Holland as a casus belli, notwithstanding that suchan invasion would not in itself involve any contractualresponsibilitj&apos;&apos; on the part of France.4.        The French Government have also asked for an assurance that an invasion of Switzerland would, no lessthan an invasion of Switzerland would, no less than an in-vasion of Holland, be heneeforv/ard considered^as justifyingand calling for the decision contemplated by His Majesty^Government in the latter event.     In reply to this request His Majesty1s Government wish to inform the FrenchGovernment that in their view a German attack onSwitzerland would also be clear evidence of an attempt by Germany to dominate Europe by force, and that fromthis point of view a German attack on the netherlands and a German attack on Switzerland would be in the samecategory.     His Majesty1s Government would accordingly be ready to undertake, if Germany invaded Switzerland andFrance thereupon declared war upon Germany, that GreatBritain would go to the assistance of France, in thesame way that they understand that France would be willingto support Great Britain if Germany invaded Holland andGreat Britain thereupon declared war on Germany.5&apos;. In the fourth paragraph of their memorandum theFrench&apos;&quot; Government have set out their conception of thecommon attitude which,rlji their view, should be adoptedby Great Britain and France in face of the threat of
*Y .1unprovoked attack &quot;by Germany or Italy, and it is onthe understanding that this conception is fully shared by His Majesty&apos;s Government that they would be preparedto adopt a similar attitude to that of His MajestyVsGovernment in the event of a German invasion of theNetherlands.6. It is clear that joint action by Germany andItaly against the two western Great Powers, or against any one of them, would have to be resisted in common bythe two Powers with the whole of their resources;    and indeed any unprovoked attack delivered by Germany uponPrance, whether acting alone or in support of Italy,would call into play the obligations which His majesty&apos;s government have assumed towards the French government by treaty.     While it is possible that in the event of anattack upon France by Italy alone it might not necessarilybo to France&apos;s interest that Great Britain shouldintervene, if the effect of such intervention were tobring Germany into what might otherwise be a localisedconflict, His Majesty&apos;s Government are fully conscious that the.risks to which the two Powers are severallyexposed cannot be dissociated.     The French Governmentwill have noted the statement made by the Prime minister in the Eonse of Commons on 6th February in which he saidthat while it was impossible to examine in detail allthe hypothetical cases which might ariso, he felt boundto make it plain that the solidarity of interest by which France and the United Kingdom were united was such thatany threat to the vital interests of France, from whatever quarter it came, must evoke the immediateco-operation of the United Kingdom.
7, It Is in the light of this situation that HisMajesty&apos;s Government have proposed to the FrenchGovernment that the conversations which have taken place between the two General staffs should he made more extensive in scope and more intimate in character thanin the past.     The conclusions which His Majesty*sGovernment have reached as to the future conduct ofthese conversations were outlined in my telegram NO, 25of the 3rd February, and have already been communicated by Your Excellency to the French Government.8. I shall be glad if you will make a communication to the French Government in the sense of the presenttelegram, and if you will inform them that His Majesty^Government are communicating Its terras to tho BelgianGovernment for their secret information.9*        You should impress upon the French Governmentthe secret character of the present communication.
