His colleagues would see thaton the previous day (31st January) President Roosevelthad given evidence before the Military AffairsCommittee of the Senate and that he had been reportedin the newspapers to have said that the United states were prepared to give the Democracies, in any conflict with the Dictatorships, every possible assistance short of declaring war and sending American troops to europe.He would like to make one or two comments onHerr Hitler&apos;s speectu    It was noticeable that the speech delivered differed in a number of respects from the forecasts which had so confidently been made;e.g., that he would make a demand for the return of colonies;    or would call for a cessation of our re-armament programme;    or that he would announce Germany&apos;intention to support Italian claims against France.In his view an interesting feature of the speech wasthe amount of time which was devoted to economics.. ... t
The   Secretary of   State for Foreign   affairs said that his general conclusion was that herr hitler&apos;s speech did not alter the situation verymuch.    It would,, no doubt, make it rather moredifficult for him to start on some adventure;   butit justified no relaxation of our precautions.There were certain apparently well-confirmedreports of a concentration in Italian East Africaof Italian forces and material in the neighbourhoodof Jibuti.    This appeared to be part of thegeneral policy of intimidation.In reply to a question as to the meaning of herr Hitler&apos;s statements about broadcasting, theForeign Secretary said that he thought it was clear that Herr Hitler was referring to the B.B.C.talks in GermaneIn the course of discussion the view was expressed that the B.B.C talks were &quot;straightnews&quot; and that there was no real ground for criticism of them.    Some criticisms however^ was directed at the handling of the Manifesto signed by anumber of distinguished people, which had made :its first appearance in a German broadcast, before it appeared in the English papers on 28th January.The Secretary of State said that he had seen the French Ambassador on the 28th January.K. Corbin had thought that Roumania was the dangerspot, and had also asked what would be our attitude as regards a German attack on Switzerland.    TheSecretary of State had replied that, speakingpersonally, he hoped that we would decide to support

Daladier on the 29thJanuary.    The latter had expressed the view thata German attack on Holland should he considered as a casus belli both by France and Great Britain.M. Daladier, who had promised a written reply which had not yet been received, had also raised the question of compulsory military service inGreat Britain.The Secretary of State had seen the BelgianAmbassador on the 28th January, and had gatheredthe impression that Belgium would endeavour tokeep out of war unless she was attacked.A communication had been sent to Vvashingtonfor the personal and secret information of thePresident, informing him of the information which had reached us of the possibility of aGerman invasion of Holland.    It appeared that theState Department anticipated not so much an invasion of Holland,as German mobilisation on the dutch frontier and demands for the surrender of part ofthe Dutch East Indies.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported recent contacts with the netherlands government, from which it appeared that the Dutchwould do their best to avoid hostilities, but thatif attacked they would fight to the last ditch.In reply to the President of the Board ofTrade, the Foreign Secretary said that he was not aware of the reason for the breaking off of trade negotiations between Germany and Russia, nor washe aware of any recent troop movements in Germany.

It wouldbe possible for them to continue their activitieson much the same lines as at present without raisingany question of principle.The Cabinet took note of this statement.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said thatthe Officer Commanding H.M.S. Devonshire off theSouth East Coast of Spain had been notified by theBarcelona Authorities that he was expected to saluteGeneral Franco&apos;s flag when going in and out ofBarcelona.      Hitherto he had dodged the issue byentering or leaving the port in darkness, but itwas necessary to reach a decision whether this action could be taken without prejudicing the question ofthe recognition of General Franco&apos;s Government.The view was generally expressed that .it was desirable to comply with the wishes of the BarcelonaAuthorities in this matter but it was.agreed that thequestion should be settled in consultation betweenthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theFirst Lord of the Admiralty.

United States Government were going hack on thefie. 6 ^) 3.undertaking which they had given us in regard totheir measure of support of the Chinese currency.He thought that this was not in fact the case., toutthat the State Department had taken alarm at asuggestion that we should indicate in parliament that the United States Government were proposing totake simultaneous and parallel action with us, and feared that any such statement would give rise to difficulties with their Isolationists-      The view of the UnitedStates Government was that they had done more toassist China than we had and that if now we gaveeffect to our proposals in respect of the proposedguaranteed loan of  3 millions for currencystabilisation purposes, we should then only have done as much for China as America had already done.In the course of discussion which ensued,   THECHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he thoughtthat if our proposals were adopted,  it would benecessary for us to make it plain to Parliament thatwe were not the only country which was taking actionin this matter.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY thought we could use the argument already indicated, namely,  that the UnitedStates had already done more than we had.      It would,of course, be better if we could also have said thatthe United States Government were taking simultaneousaction,     .  but   that   Government were mostsaid that his colleagues would no doubt have noticeda recent telegram (No0 50 dated 28th January) from washington from which it might appear that the
unwilling to appear to be acting in collusion with us.We were still awaiting a formal answer from theUnited States Government on the matter.THE HOME SECRETARY thought that if we wereto give effect to this proposal, the present was theright time to do it.     He referred, in this connection,to the changed tenor of recent telegrams fromSir Robert Craigie at Tokyo.THE PRIME MINISTER did not dissent from thisview, but thought it might be desirable to see whether the statement which President Roosevelt was reported to have made to the Military AffairsCommittee of the Senate at Washington would arouse-criticism in the United States to any great extent.In reply to the President of the Board of Trade,THE FOREIGN SECRETARY explained that there was nofurther information as to the Chinese attitude inregard to the customs loans.     He wished to correct thestatement which he had made at the previous meeting ofthe Cabinet that the Chinese Government had informed him that they hoped to be able to meet us byimplementing the arrangement by the 2nd -May.     He was afraid that this statement which was based on hisrecollection of an interview with the Chinese Ambassador,could not be confirmed.The Cabinet took note of the statement madeby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
A. &apos;0 8PROPOSED 4. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSnoMMEEGlAL.MISSIONS TO       said that the Interdepartmental Committee on CentralPhTIMANlAand GREECE.       and South East Europe had now issued their second(Previous Interim Report, which would shortly he considered toy the reference:Cabinet 57(3$ Foreign Policy Commit tee o He wished, however, as a matter!Conclis ion l)of urgency to raise before the Cabinet that morningone proposal submitted by the interdepartmental committee, nameljr, that commercial missions should besent to Roumania and Greecec     From the psychologicalpoint of view, he thought this proposal was of considerable importance.     At the moment it was difficult to makeprecise proposals as to what form the mission to roumania should take., but he hoped the Cabinet would beable to agree in principle to the despatch of this mission, which would enable the necessary preparations to toe made.The Foreign Secretary thought it right to pointout that, while the immediate reaction in Roumania tothe despatch of a mission would toe favouratole, theposition would toe changed if on the termination of themission no concrete results emergedo     He thought, there-fore, that, in the long run, the Government might toepressed to increase the figure of  10 million allocated to political credits in the Export Credits GuaranteeBill now &quot;before Parliament sTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he agreed that there were good arguments for sending acommercial mission to RoumaniaQ     At the same time out ofa total of  10 million available for political credits 1 million had already been earmarked for Roumania, andthere was always the possibility of scope being found for commercial credits0     He could   not, therefore accept
the Foreign Secretary&apos;s suggestion that the despatch ofa mission might result in some increase in the figure of 10 million to he made available for political credits.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE reminded hiscolleagues of the discussion which had taken place at cabinet the meeting noted in the margin in regard to Anglo German60 (38)Conclusion 7.   Trade Relations, when the suggestion had been generally approved that he might at some stage pay a visit toGermany.     Matters were now moving.     It was possible thata dinner would be given in London by the British Coal Tradeto celebrate the successful negotiations between representatives of the British and German Coal Industries,to which Dr. Funk was being invited.     This might provide an opportunity for hinting that any reciprocal invitationwould be accepted by the President.     He, the President,thought it was desirable that if there was any possibilityof his visit to Germany being arranged he should have anopportunity of mentioning the Commercial Mission to roumania privately to the Germans before the news of theMission to Roumania became public.After further discussion the Cabinet agreed(l) To approve in principle the-proposal that a commercial mission should be&apos;despatched to Roumanian(2)    That the question of the date of theannouncement of the despatch of this mission should be settled by theSecretary of State fox1 Foreign affairs and the President of the Board of Tradein consultation0(3)    That, in the meantime, it was undesirable that our Minister in Bukarest should beauthorised to mention the matter toKing Carole(4)    That the proposals in regard to the suggestedcommercial mission to Greece should besettled at a later date

4 flOlAWfiT.O-GERMANStations.The Positionof Holland..(previous reference:Cabinet 2(39),conclusion (5)).5. In conformity with their reference atthe Meeting mentioned in the margin, the cabinet had before them the Report of the Foreign PolicyCommittee (CoPo 3 (39),.) on the question of possible german aggression against Holland, to which was appended a Report by the Chiefs of Staff (Paper No.CO. So830) in continuation of CP- 20 (39).      TheChiefs of Staff had also attended the Meeting ofthe Foreign Policy Committee at which the referencefrom the Cabinet had been considered.THE PRIME MINISTER explained the main point in the Committee^ report.-     Paragraph 4contained the main conclusion of the Chiefs ofStaff Report, which might be summarised as being to the effect that, while war with Germany in thenear future would give rise to a very serious situation, failure to intervene in the event ofGerman aggression against Holland would havedisastrous effects, which would outweigh the risks of a conflict,       The Foreign policy Committee hadendorsed these conclusions, and stated that a german invasion of Holland would constitute a casus belli.In other words it would give rise to a situationwhich would justify our going to war with Germanybut that did not mean that we should necessarily have to go to war forthwith without taking intoaccount other considerations.    One such consideration was mentioned in paragraph 5, namely, the possibility that Holland would not resist invasion.Whatever form German aggression took, itwas necessary that we should deal with the matter inconjunction with France and Belgium, and it was difficultto see how either of these countries could keep out ofwar if Germany invaded Holland.
Before Staff Conversations could be undertaken tomeet the contingency of a German invasion of Holland itwas necessary to make diplomatic approaches to the Frenchand Belgian Governments.      In view of certain information which had been received, the Foreign Policy Committee had authorised the Foreign Secretary to make these approachesas a matter of urgency.     No considered reply had yet beenreceived from either Government.      It was thought likely that the French Government would raise the question ofour attitude in the event of a German attack on Switzerland.The Prime Minister thought, that a German attack onSwitzerland would be clear evidence of an attempt byGermany to dominate Europe by force, and that from thispoint of view a German attack on Holland and an attack onSwitzerland were in the same category.The logical consequence of a decision to regard aGerman invasion of Holland as a casus belli was to put ourselves in a position to resist such aggression as effectively as possible.     This meant that we should havethe closest possible understanding with other countries who would be our allies, and should know what action theywould take;    otherwise we should be too late.    Hitherto wehad avoided very close contacts between our Staffs and the staffs of potential allies, e.g. France and Belgium onthese matters for fear of finding ourselves involved in specific commitments^     We were faced with a choice between two courses, and the Foreign Policy Committee was satisfiedthat the right course was that conversations should now proceed for the formulation of joint plans, notwithstanding that these plans would constitute more binding obligationsthan had hitherto been contemplated.The Prime Minister explained that the ForeignPolicy Committee had reached the conclusion that theStaff Conversations should proceed on the basis of- 10 -
war against Germany and Italy in combination, andthat their scope should include all likely fields of operations,  especially the Mediterranean and theMiddle East.     This included the Par East, in regardto which the Foreign Policy Committee thought japan would be likely to adopt a cautious attitude, at anyrate at the outset of any emergency in the near future.If the Cabinet approved these general propositions,the next step would be for the Chiefs of Staff toconsider the best way of initiating conversations on the wider basis now proposed,TEE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS saidthat he thought that the Staff Conversations should include the Dutch,      Even if Holland could be over-runIn a few days &quot;Fortress Holland&quot; might be converted into a formidable anti-aircraft zone.      He also thought that Dutch resistance in the Dutch east indies could be made distinctly formidable if their forces were properly modernised.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY mentioned that the DutchForeign Minister was coming over to this country onthe 14th February for a visit to the Grotius Society,and had expressed a desire to see him.It was agreed that it would be necessary thatthe question of Staff contacts with the Dutch shouldbe taken into account.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that it seemed to be generally agreed that Dutch resistance was not likelyto have much material effect on the final result ofany war which started from a German invasion of Holland.In the circumstances, he felt that it was easy toover-emphasise the importance, from our point of view,of the question whether Holland resisted invasion ornot.
THE PRIME MINISTER, while in general agreementwith this view, said that it was impossible to envisage all the possible circumstances which might arise.     For example, Germany might say that shewanted the use of some of Holland&apos;s canals in theevent of Germany being attacked by some other Power.He agreed, however, that any attempt by Germany toobtain military control of some kind over Hollandby threat of force would be such evidence of Germany&apos;intention to dominate Europe by force as to requirethis country to treat it as a casus belli.Discussion then turned on the question of howStaff Conversations should proceed.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat up to the present the Staff Conversations hadpursued a somewhat desultory course, at the Attachelevel.     Our aim should be to make ourselves as readyas possible? and it was therefore necessary that thescope of the Staff Conversations should be extended.It must be remembered, however, that trouble might arise not of aggression against Holland but from someother cause.      It was therefore necessary to lose no time in getting on with extended Conversations on allthe issues on which Staff Conversations were ofimportance.     He thought the Conversations should takeplace between responsible members of the three services and their opposite numbers in the FrenchServices.In further discussion it was agreed that thiswas a big step forward and was almost tantamount toan Alliance;   but it was felt that although the stepmight be a big one, it&quot;was one which must be taken.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS thoughtthat it might be desirable to make sure of the French
attitude in the event of a German attack on Holland,before informing the French that we were prepared toenter on extended Staff Conversations..THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN affairs thought that it was necessary that the Staff conversations should deal with the general question of a war In theWest, and should not merely be concerned with thepossibility of a German invasion of Holland.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, as regards ourspecif:.o commitments to the French Government, hethought it was undesirable that we should go further than we had already gone.      He had, however, indicated in!the speech which he had made to the Foreign PressAssociation on 13th December, 1938, that &quot;our reflationswith France are so close as to pass beyond mere legal obligations since they are founded on identity of interests&quot;.    He thought it was important to preservethis attitude, because if war broke out between Italyand France it might well be in the French interest thatwe should keep out of the war, in order to avoid bringing in Germany on Italy&apos;s side.In regard to Staff Conversations the PrimeMinister thought that the right course was to informthe Chiefs of Staff of the decisions reached by theCabinet and to ask them to survey the whole position at once with a view to our being in a position to under&apos;-take Staff Conversations with the French at an earlydate.This course was gener-ally agreed to, and the -Foreign Secretary was also authorised to inform theFrench Government that we were instr\icting our Staffs toproceed on this basis,It was also agreed, that, as soon as a satisfactoryreply was received from the French Government,authority should be given to the Staffs to embark on Conversations on the wider basis now ^pjg^g^fcsed.
THE CHANCELLOR.-OF&apos;THE DUCHY OP LANCASTER raised the -question of leakage, and whether it would be possible to take- some action vis-a-vis Germany to avoid giving rise to -unnecessary&apos;suspicions.It was generally felt, however-, &quot;that it wouldnot he wise to take any.measure in this-sense, .and.that if leakage occurred -it should he- explained to theGermans that &quot;what&apos;was &quot;happening was no-more than a con-&quot;&apos;tinuance of measures of co-operation.ilieasures of THE PRIME MINISTER then referred to the concluding&quot;^Aoceleration^paragraph of the Report of the Foreign Policy Committee,dealing with measures of acceleration..jtn regard to H,MoS, REPULSE it was explained that steps had now been taken to replace the A.A. guns in sucK&quot;a way thfit-the ship could still be used, if need be,for the visit of Their Majesties to Ganada next May.The conclusions reached by the Cabinet may besummarised as follows:-(n,)    The Cabinet agreed to approve generally therecommendations contained in the report ofthe Foreign Policy Committee (CP.  3 (39))and in particular s -. (a) endorsed the Conclusion recorded inparagraph 22 of the Report of the Chiefs -of Staff Subcommittee dated .25th January..,1939 (Paper F.P. (36) 77) which reads as follows:-&quot;If we-were compelled to enter such awar in the near future we should be confronted with a position more serious than, the Empire has ever faced before.The ultimate outcome of the conflictmight well depend upon the intervention .of other Powers, in particular-, of theUnited States of America^
11 rl1     dNevertheless,  as we have pointed out inour first Report (paragraph 12), failure to intervene would have such moral andother repercussions as would seriouslyundermine our -position in the eyes of theDominions and the world in general.     we might thus he deprived of support in a subsequent    struggle between Germany andthe British Empire..    In our view it is hardly an exaggeration to say that fail-ure to take up such a challenge would place Germany in a predominant positionin Europe and corresxDondingly loy/er our prestige throughout the world.     There-fore we have, as we see it, no choicebut to regard a German invasion of holland as a direct challenge to our security,&quot;(b) Agreed that any attempt by Germanyto obtain military control of some JG*e4fr^c&amp;G-uiat over Holland by. threat of force would be such evidence ofGermany&apos;s intention to dominate Europeby force as to require this countryto treat it as a casus belli.(c) Agreed that a German attack en SwiAjzerland-would be clear evidence of an attempt by Germany to dominate Europe by forceand that from this point of view aGerman attack on Holland and an attackon Switzerland were in the same category..(d) It followed from (c) above that if, inour Conversations with the FrenchGovemmentin regard to a possible german invasion of Holland (See (e)below) the French should raise the parallel case cf Switzerland andshould enquire whether if Germany invaded.Switzerland and France thereupondeclared war upon Germany we should goto the assistance of France our answer should be in the affirmative.(e) To take note with approval that in order&apos;to avoid delay the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs had initiated a diplomatic approach to the FrenchGovernment in regard to the positionof Holland;   and in this connection had referred to the disturbing  rumoursin regard to Holland and had indicated that on a,provisional examinationof the matter His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere disposed to take the viewoutlined in (a) and (b) above andthat the matter was being further examined by His Majesty&apos;s government who would be glad to learn the viewsof the French Government on the subject.

Agreed that as regards our specific -commitments to France it was undesirable that we should go fur-ther than we had already gone.That it was important to preserve the attitude laid down by thePrime Minister in his speech to theForeign Press Association on13th December, 1938 that &quot;ourrelations with France are so closeas to pass beyond mere legal obligations since they are founded on identity of interest&quot; becauseif war broke out between Italyand France it might well be in theFrench interest that we should keep out of   he war in order toavoid bringing Germany inon Italy&apos;s side,.Agreed that the Chiefs of staff should now be informed of thedecisions reached by the cabinet and summarised in the foregoingconclusions and that the Chiefs ofStaff should be invited to survey and report upon the whole positionforthwith with a view to our being in a position to  undertake the staff conversations with the french on the wider basis now proposed at ah early date.Agreed to authorise the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs to \inform the French Government thatwe were instructing our Staffs toproceed on this basis aAgreed that as soon as a satisfactoryreply had been received from theFrench Government the Staffs shouldbe authorised to embark on con-versations on the wider basis nowproposed.

The Conference should be able to openabout the 7th February..      It had now been agreedthat the Palestine Defence Party should have threerepresentatives, and it was hoped to include themin the same delegation as the other representativesof the Palestine Arabs, after their arrival in thiscountry.

The Committee&quot;s first recommendation wasthat no final decision should be reached on any of thepoints mentioned in paragraph 74 of G.P.  4 (39) untilthe discussions with the Arabs and Jews had proceeded someway, and that the United Kingdom Delegates should havea considerable measure of discretion to s^fe^sirfe^other proposals.On the constitutional question the committee did not admit either the Jewish plan for the creationof a Jewish State covering the whole of Palestine northe Arab plan that the whole country should become an arab State.      They thought however that the possibility should be left over that at some time in the future either the Arab or the Jewish population in Palestine might beready to acquiesce in the creation of an independent state in which the other party predominated.The Committee also suggested that the rejection ofthe Arab demand for independence should be softened, ifpossible, by some gesture of special regard for Moslemreligious susceptibilities, as for example by an offer to the surrounding Moslem countries of the right to
participate &quot;by means of a body of guards or otherwisein the protection of the Moslem Holy Places in Jerusalem.It was also necessary to consider what share in the Government of the country could be given to theJewish and Arab populations of Palestine.      The proposal was to offer an Advisory Council which would includebesides an official bloc, Jewish and Arab representatives in equal numbers.      It would have been possible to fix theJewish and Arab membership of this Council on a   basis of population but it was felt that to do so would condemnthe Jews to a permanent minority position and that.thiswould be contrary to the spirit of the Balfour Declaration.This proposal would probably be accepted by theJews but might well be rejected by the Arabs.        indeed it would seem possible that the Arabs would object sostrongly to it that persistence on it might wreck theConference.      If so the proposal mighfc have to be abandoned. ,There was also a proposal for turning the AdvisoryCouncil inbo a Legislative Council if both parties so desired.In regard to immigration it was proposed to reject the demand of the Arabs for the immediate and complete stoppage of Jewish immigration and the Committee recommendedthat the United Kingdom Delegates should be prepared to putforward either proposal (A) or proposal (B) on page 22 of cp. 4 (39).      He was afraid that the Arabs would not accept proposal (A) and it may not be possible to persuade the Jews to accept proposal (B), but a great effort v/ould be made to do so.     In the last resort it might be necessaryto consider a plan which involved even greater concessions to the Arabs in regard to restrictions on Jewish immigrationthan those contemplated in Scheme (B).- 20 -
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES thendrew attention to the suggestion   that he should he authorised to endeavour to persuade Dr. V/eizmann to givefavourable consideration to a unilateral declaration tothe effect that the Jewish leaders would in future makethe exercise of the right of Jewish immigration into palestine contingent on Arab consent.      It was clear thatif Dr. V/eizmann could be persuaded to make this unilateral declaration the effect on Arab opinion would be considerable.Finally the Colonial Secretary drew attention tothe proposal that legislative steps should be taken to restrict the sale of land by Arabs to Jews;    to therecommendation that the United Kingdom representatives atthe Conferences should be -The Prime ministers the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,The Secretary of State for the Colonies,Mr. R0A. Butler, M.P., parliamentary under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.and to the Appendix setting out his proposals in regardto procedure, publicity and entertainment for thediscussions.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he only wished to add that the Palestine Committee had been most favourablyimpressed with the masterly paper in which the Secretaryof State for the Colonies had submitted these proposals.These proposals had been carefully examined by theCommittee and they had found themselves able substantially to endorse the Colonial Secretary&apos;s recommendations.THE LORD CHANCELLOR referred to the Memorandum
by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(CP. 18(39)-) in regard to legal arguments likelyto be advanced by the Arab representatives.   Hewas by no means satisfied that the British case was fairly stated in the Memorandum which had been circulated by the Foreign Secretary and he hadtaken the opportunity of discussing it with theForeign Office official who had prepared it.He did not altogether agree with the view taken inthis Memorandum in regard to the McMahon correspondenceand he would fully expect that if the matter was submitted to some such body as the Hague Tribunalthey would take the view that the pledges in theMcMahon correspondence did not apply to Palestine.If the discussions at the Conference turned on legalpoints he would be happy to offer any assistance tothe Colonial Secretary..THE COLONIAL SECRETARY said that he would bevery glad for an expression of the Lord Chancellor&apos;views although the British delegates would, of course,-6&amp;*-v ^-^f A*^itry to avoid^discuision on the legal aspects of theproblem.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said that hehad just received a formal request from the All-IndiaMoslem League for representation at the LondonConferences.     He proposed and the Cabinet agreedto reply that His Majesty&apos;s Government regretted that they would be unable to extend the scope ofthe Delegations which had already been settled.His Majesty1s Government were fully seized with theviews of the Moslems in India.
9 ftThe Cabinet agreed: -(i)   To endorse the views set out in theReport (Paper CP. 29(39)) of theCabinet Committee on Palestine whichapproved generally the conclusionssummarised in paragraph 74 on pages21 and 22 of CP. 4 (39) (See Appendix Ito these Conclusions).(ii) To approve the arrangements for theprocedure, publicity and entertain-ment of the Conferences.(iii)   To authorise the Secretary of Statefor India to reply to the representations of the All-India Moslem League on thelines suggested by him.

THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that asa result of the negotiations which had. &quot;been difficult and protracted,  8 millions of new money would now he made available to the Czechoslovak Government,over and above the  10 millions which had been provisionally advanced.     He also drew attention tothe arrangements made whereby our free gift of 4 million would be paid into a special account and used for refugees.     The arrangements secured underthis head were very satisfactory and would,he thought,satisfy the critics.     He explained that thearrangement in regard to the guaranteed loan of  8millions was that the loan would be issued by the czechoslovak Government, and that the loan carrieda joint and several guarantee from the FrenchGovernment and ourselves.      In view of the urgency,notice had already been given of the presentation of the Bill.The Cabinet took note of the outcome of the negotiations and of the presentation of the Bill in Parliament.
-f iqj (*1 L U*E FLEET airreviouseference:cabinet 5338), Con-conclusion SA)8. The Cabinet had. under consideration aMemorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty(CP. 13 (39)) outlining the existing state of theFleet Air Arm and the measures v-foich his advisers and himself considred necessary for its developmentup to the 31st March, 1942.     The First Lord sought authority from his colleagues to proceed with theprogramme summarised in the Appendix to thisMemorandum (subject to discussion with the treasury on points of detail affecting expenditure), which showed requirements in terms of aircraft, personnel and shore-bases0     The figures given illustrated the state of the Fleet Air Arm at the beginningof the next financial year9 and the scale of expansion that would be required to meet the approvedprogramme for the development of the Fleet itself,including the provision of aircraft for the 5Aircraft Carriers now under construction,THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY explained the main points in his memorandum.     The presentposition in regard to aircraft was not so good as itappeared, since a considerable proportion of theaircraft at present available was of obsolescenttypes.     He referred to the difficulty of obtainingaeroplanes of adequate pe rformance5  which couldall land on the decks of aircraft carriers.The number of first-line aircraft 490was made up of 360 machines in.aircraft carriers,9 in a seaplane carrier, 35 in catapult ships and 86 in cruisers.     295 of these would be tor-torpedo-spotter reconnaissance.     Of the remainder 110
4 ^1 ,j 6would &quot;be fighters.     The war reserve, which was also490, was calculated on figures as to wastage etc.supplied by the Air Ministry.As regards the personnel, by 31st march the Navy would have provided 2,600 naval ratings, i.e.over half the total requirements at that date.     It would,be still necessary for the Air Ministry to find main-tenance ratings for some time, as it was impossibleto provide them from the Fleet.With regard to bases, the total number of schoolsquadrons in 1939 was 19, and of disembarked squadrons14, giving a total of 33*     The number of bases atpresent available to accommodate these squadrons was wholly inadequate.     He emphasised the expensivenessof using carriers for training, and the undesirableeffects on pilots of this course.     As regards cost,the total expenditure within the ration period was 38:? millions as compared with expenditure providedwithin the ration       figure of  30 millions.     Themaintenance figure amounted to  10 millions a year.He asked the Cabinet to approve the proposals in princi-pie subject to discussion of the financial   stallsbetween the Chancellor of the Exchequer and-himself.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that therewere a number of points which he thought should bediscussed between the First Lord and himself.     Forexample, the provision for Fleet Air Arm reserveswas on the basis of reserves for eight or nine months,
i ii Ov/hereas those for the R.A.F. reserves were for themoment confined to nine weeks&apos; reserves, with theexception of fighters, in regard to which the reserveswere sixteen weeks.     He thought consideration shouldhe given to the question whether the same scaleshould not operate for both Services.In regard to personnel, he thought it would benecessary to make some mutual arrangement, so far as concerned the Fleet Air Arm and the Metropolitan AirForce.     He also drew attention to the fact that theAir Ministry were liable to make good any deficiencies in the Admiralty Fleet Air -Arm Programme as it existed in 1937, and thought that the Ministry should not beheld liable for deficiencies due to any additional itemsadded since that date, or to any acceleration of theprogramme.     He also expressed some concern as to theproposal to establish a repair base in so vulnerablean area as Portsmouth.     He suggested that thesematters should be discussed by him with the First Lord.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said there hadbeen some discussion between the Admiralty and theTreasury on this matter.     He thought it was generally agreed that the present state of the Fleet Air Arm requiredimprovement.     He raised no point in regard to thefirst line strength, which had been accepted some time ago.     He felt, however, that the Admiralty proposals should be susceptible of reduction in two ways.     First,he thought the Admiralty were providing for largerreserves than was reasonable.      Secondly, he thought they were pressing to provide greater shore training facilities for their personnel than was necessary,,
The cost of the present proposals for theexpansion of the Fleet Air Arm represented an excess 8 million over the provision for the Fleet Air Armmade within the Admiralty ration of  410 million,which had been agreed by the Cabinet last July.To this must be added any expenditure on Fleet air arm bases abroad.     He thought that it could fairly be argued that provision for Fleet Air Arm bases,both at home and abroad, could have been met withinthe ration figure of  410 million, approved by theCabinet last July.     He was prepared to discuss thematter with the First Lord, but he felt bound&apos; to poiout that in his view the increase asked for wasexcessive.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS(designate) said that the progress made in the last six months in regard to the handing over to theAdmiratly of the responsibility for administrativecontrol of the Fleet Air Arm had been considerable and that there was now a much more- helpful spiritof co-operation between the two Departments,,The Cabinet agreed: -To approve in principle the proposals submittedby the First LQrd of theAdmiralty in CP. 13 (39),    .subject to such modificationas may be agreed upon in discussions betv/een the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the First Lordof the Admiralty and theSecretary of State for Air.
I o umSAFETY INfjoAL MINES.. 9.    The Cabinet had before them a Note by thePresident of the Board of Trade (CP. 15 (39))circulating for the consideration of his colleagues^previous reference:Cabinet 56     a Memorandum by the Secretary for Mines on the acticsn.(38) fon-eluftion 6.)    to be taken on the Report of the Royal Commissioner) 7 on Safety in Coal Mines.     The President agreed with theSecretary for Mines&apos; proposals, and recommended thatthe latter should be authorised, in reply to aQuestion in the House, to make the statement set outin paragraph 9 of his Memorandum.     This statement would involve the introduction of two Bills:    first9a short Bill this Session to remove the statutorylimitation imposed on the Mines Departments annual expenditure by the Mining Industry Act, 1920;   and,secondly, a Safety in Coal Mines Bill which would &quot;beintroduced at some future date, but not this Session.After the President of the Board of trade had explained the matter shortly, theCabinet agreed to the above proposals.
CAMPS POP WAR       10.       The Cabinet had before them a memorandum and PEACEPURPOSES. by the lord Privy Seal (CP. 22(39.)), in whichf?fZ bc-(3(])\ ^e se^ ^or^a a summary of the conclusions reached by a Conference of representatives of theDepartments concerned,, held on the 13th Januarysto consider the question of the Government con-structing or assisting the construction of campsto serve the triple purpose of school camps andcamps for adult holiday-makers in time of peace9and camps for refugees in time of war.    The lord privy Seal asked for Cabinet authority to proceed,,on the basis of immediate urgencys with a schemewhich he outlined at the conclusion of his memorandum.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that this proposal had the general blessing of the Civil Defence(Policy) Committee.    It involved making a start with camps for peace-time purposes9 and also inorder to help with civil defence measures.   Asregards the latter the scheme must be regardedas part of a long term policy.    There was some evidence that in rural areas9 particularly inScotland and the north of England,, there would bea considerable shortage of accommodation in timeof war9 and that any measures which could betaken at once to supplement the accommodation which could be made available by billeting wouldbe helpful.In peace-time9 the camps would serve either as school camps or as holiday camps.    There had been considerable developments in both types of campsin recent years9 and although the knowledge ofthese developments was not very fully co-ordinated.it provided a sufficient basis on which to take the steps now proposed.    Por ex^Dle9 two camps had
1*5 Obeen started     by     Post Office staffs3 one inScotland and one in North Wales.   Again a numberof local authorities had used their powers to startschool camps.-   He thought it was important thatthe Government should take steps which would supple-ment and encourage the movement.The Lord Privy Seal also attached considerable importance to the immediate setting up of a non-profit making Association to run camps.    Such an organisation would have great value in time ofwar, and would facilitate the task of providing the alternative accommodation for those whosehouses had been destroyed by air bombardment.It was proposed that the Exchequer should find 50 per cent, of the capital cost and 50 percent, of the standing maintenance charges.    On this basis it was calculated that the charge per headwould be in the school camps 16/- a head,, and inthe holiday camps 25/- a head, with half price for children.    These terras would attract many people who would not be able to afford the camps at presentprovidedeTHE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said he had met Mr. Langley Taylor9 the architect.who was referred to in the Memorandum,, and had been much impressed by his efficiency and enthusiasm.Mr, Langley Taylor had said that if the Governmentwould provide a scheme and would make some contribution in respect of the defence value ofthe scheme he thought that a good deal of moneymight be forthcoming from philanthropic sourcesat a low rate of interest.- 32 -
4 i)*5THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR SCOTLAND pointed outthat a Housing Association had teen set up to buildtimber houses in Scotland, and that this Association couldbe used in connection with the present schemeoTHE PRIME MINISTER said that apart from schoolcamps, in regard to which the principle of state contribution had already been admitted, he assumed thatthe only justification for a grant of State money for thispurpose was the use of the camps for defence purposes.Private enterprise was already constructing holidaycamps, and apparently filling them on a commercial basis.Would not the establishment of a State subsidy scheme giverise to difficulties?THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the camps which hadalready been provided by the Post Office employeescatered for a type of staff who were relatively well paid and able to afford higher weekly payments than were contemplated under the present scheme.THE PRIME MINISTER said that while he was not against trying out the present scheme, he thought that-itwasperhaps unnecessary to embark upon it on the large scale proposed,, or to attempt tc carry it out so rapidly.    Hethought that this was only too likely to result inwasteful expenditure of moneyo    He would like to see thescheme dealt with somewhat more experimentally than was now proposed.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that therehad been no opportunity for the details of the scheme tobe considered by the Treasury.    He pointed out thatthe present scheme might involve, not merely heavy capital expenditure, but continuing subsidies in peace-time to provide holidays for people who might like to- 33 -
live in camps.    It was difficult to justify such ascheme in the present critical state of our finances.If, however, the proposal was put forward on the grounds that it would help the billeting of persons evacuated from vulnerable areas, it was only- right to point outthat the expenditure proposed only provided for 70,000refugees which was a drop in the ocean.    He was willingto agree that the matter should be discussed further, witha view to an experiment being made on a smaller scale,provided it was clear that the scheme did not involvethe taxpayer finding money for purposes other thandefence.(At this point the discussion was adjourned until 5 p.m. in the afternoon - forcontinuation see Cabinet 4 (39)conclusion 1.)Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.1st February, 1939.
JL   t)APPENDIX I.SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS.74. The following is therefore a summary of my recommendations.     But I ?/ould repeat that we should not reach an absolutely final decision on any of these pointsuntil the discussions with Jews and Arabs have proceededsome way.     The attitude of either party might lead us tothe conclusion that it would be wise to modify one or other of these proposals in some way:-I - Future Constitution.(l)   Neither the Jewish claim for the creation at some future date of a Jewish state covering the whole ofPalestine nor the Arab claim that the country should become an Arab state can be admitted.      We should makea clear statement that this is so, unless at any timein the future conditions so change that either theArab or the Jewish population in Palestine are readyto acquiesce in the creation of an independent state in which the other party predominates (paragraph 22et seq).(2)    We should offer to establish, in addition to theexisting official Executive Council, an AdvisoryCouncil, which would include, besides an official bloc,Jewish and Arab representatives in equal numbers.Jexvish and Arab members would be elected on communalregisters..     The constitution should provide that theHigh Commissioner must consult the Advisory Council onall important matters such as immigration, finance andtariffs.      It should also provide that, if a majority-1-,p.4(39).7.
4 n oid 0of the members of the Advisory Council, which included a majority both of the Arab and jewish representatives, passed a resolution asking that theAdvisory Council should be superseded by a LegislativeCouncil on the basis of parity between the two peoples,then such a Legislative Council should beestablished (paragraph 65).(3)      The powers of municipal bodies under the municipal Corporation^ Ordinance should be re-examined and extended as far as possible and the revenues of the larger municipalities should beincreased, perhaps by allotting to them a portion ofthe urban property tax collected in their areas(paragraph 60).II - Immigration.,We should listen to the Arab and Jewisharguments and by judicious soundings during the courseof the discussions form our conclusion as to which ofthe following two alternative proposals should be suggested for adoption (paragraph 52):-A.    (i)    Jewish immigration into Palestine shouldcontinue to be regulated by the criterion of economicabsorptive capacity subject to the proviso that, inany case, the number of immigrants should not exceedsuch a level as would increase the Jewish population to the figure of 40 per cent- of the total populationby the end of ten years.      If the Arabs would not agree to the figure of 40 per cent, we should endeavourto persuade them to agree to some such figure as 35 percent.
4 O H(ii)   At the end of the ten-year period the questionof the principles to govern further Jewish immigrationshould he the subject of discussion between Arabs, jews and His Majesty&apos;s Government.B.     As in A. above, but with the difference that,instead of making the future control of immigration the&apos;subject of discussion at the end of the ten-year period,we should state that after the ten-year period furtherJewish immigration must be dependent on agreement betweenArab and Jewish representatives and the Government,i.e., the Arabs would be given a veto on any further expansion of the Jewish National Home after ten years.If we adopt this proposal I am strongly inclined to thinkthat we should not agree to a reduction of the prospectiveJewish percentage (subject to economic absorptive capacity)much below 40 per cent.^&quot;&quot;N.B..   The above proposals are subject to the reservation in paragraph 54, which indicates that in certain circumstances-ive may have tomake greater concessions to the Arabs than issuggested in B. above.J7III - Land.Legislative steps should be taken to restrict thesale of land by Arabs to Jews (paragraph 57).
4 9 appendix.11*committee on palbstine.conferences pit palestine.Procedure, Publicity and Entertainment.,Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies.1,     T.iy colleagues may like to have a brief outline ofthe arrangements which I contemplate as regards procedure,publicity and entertainment of delegates in connection withthe Conferences.2.      Bt. James&apos; Palace has been prepared for the use ofthe Conferences.     In addition to rooms for the use ofUnited Kingdom Ministers and the United Kingdom secretarialand clerical staff, the Picture Gallery has beer., arranged forgeneral meetings and there will also be two large committeerooms which could be made available for the individual useof the Arab and Jewish delegations.      It may be that they willprefer   to confer in their own hotels between meetings, butthere would appear to be much to be said, from the psychologicalpoint of view, for getting them into the atmosphere of the palace by holding opening meetings very soon after their arrival,and, if posible, for getting each of the two delegations tomake some use of the Palace thereafter for their own meetings.procedure.3*.     As regards a provisional time table, whilst we must,of course, be guided largely by the attitude of the delegationswhen they arrive in London, I think it would be useful tohave in our minds the sort of procedure which we should like to adopt if the atmosphere is favourable.     Inconvenient-1-
though, it will be, we must adhere rather strictly at the outset, I think, to the understanding on which the delegations are visiting t...is country, via., that the arabs and Jews are each coming to confer separately with HisMajesty&apos;s Government.     It is for this reason that we have adopted the title &quot;Conferences on Palestine&quot;, and my present information indicates that any attempt to get theArabs and Jews to sit down together in one room at thebeginning would render the negotiations abortive.    If we make satisfactory progress in our discussions with thetwo sides separately, there is the hope that we shall, ata later stage, succeed in bringing them into tripartitenegotiation.4.    In these circumstances, my present feeling is that thebest course would be to have two separate opening meetings,preferably on the same day soon after the arrival of the delegates, one between United Kingdom Ministers and thewhole of the Arab delegations, and the other between UnitedKingdom Ministers and the Jewish delegation.     It would bea great advantage if the Prime Minister would consent to preside at these meetings and to welcome the delegates andto address them on general lines as to the desirability ofsome agreement between the parties concerned.     The leadersof the delegations might make very brief replies to thePrime Ki&amp;ister&apos;s speech, and the method of further procedure(v/hich would have been agreed beforehand in informal discussions) would then be formally approved by. the delegations.5.     After these opening meetings with, the two sides weshould proceed, I hope, on the next day to meetings atwhich the delegatiojis would state their views and putforward their suggestions for an equitable solution ofthe problem.
6.     Prom that the discussion with each side would proceed without intermission in whatever manner seems best.     Apartfrom the discussions between us and each of the other parties, we   should try. to encourage informal meetings betweenJewish and Arab representatives.      Only when our soundingshave proceeded some way shall we be able to decide (a) whether there is any chance of turning the discussions into a formalconference of the three parties, and (b) whether and when we should produce our own proposals for a solution of theproblem.    &quot;7e should of course endeavour throughout to guide the discussions in the direction of our proposals.     &apos;7eshould keep a fairly firm guiding hand o-: the proceedings.. .PUBLICITY.7.     I propose the following arrangements regarding publicity for the proceedings of the Conferences:(a) Thci a minister should be in charge of publicityarrangements for the Conferences and should be assisted by a Principal Press Officer.    (If my colleagues agree-, Iwould be prepared, to undertake this duty myself.)(b) That the Press should be excluded.,.from Conferencemeetings.(c) That brief communiques should be issued at the&quot;conclusion of each meeting.(d) That the Minister should give, &quot;background talks&quot;to the Press at frequent but elastic intervals.(e) That the principal Press Officer, assisted bythe Departmental Press Officers, should be available to seethe Press, in the periods between the minister is back-ground talks, on such aspects of the proceedings as theMinister might think fit.
8,       /hllst it may be a counsel of perfection to suggestthat the individual Arab and Jewish delegates will be ableto refrain from talking to the ..jress, we should endeavourto secure the formal concurrence of the delegations in these arrangements and, if possible, to associate them with theMinister in charge of publicity through a Press AdvisoryCommittee or Committees representative of the delgc-tions.It would also be desirable, both on the arrival.j? .. he&quot;&quot;&quot;&apos;individual delegates and at the opening meetings, to ask them to concur in a general undertaking to treat the officialdiscussions as confidential and to refrain from giving thePress controversial material during the Conferences.ENTERTAINMENT.9.     It is proposed that the delegates and their staffs should be the guests of His Majesty&apos;s Government whilstin London.    This offer has been made to, and accepted bythe delegations from the Arab States.     I understand alsothat it is likely to be accepted by the Jewish delegation.The offer will be made to the Palestinian delegation assoon as the composition of that delegation has been settled.&apos;Arrangements are being made to accommodate the delegates at various hotels, and to extend to them the courtesiescustomary in the case of official guests.10.    It may be that we shall find, when the delegationsarrive, that-not only are they unwilling to meet together for business purposes, but that they would also not beprepared to come together if they are invited to the sameofficial entertainment.     But we should be prepared to arrangean early general reception by His Majesty&apos;s Government atLancaster House for both the Arab and the Jewish delegations.In addition, we might prepare for two Government luncheons,one to all the Arab representatives and the other to all&quot;the Jewish representatives and for various private luncheon ordinner parties to small numbers of the Palestinian Arab andthe Jewish delegations.
SUMMARY.11.     My proposals may &quot;be summarised as follows^-PROCEDURE.(a) Separate meetings with the Jews and ^.arabs at the outset.(to) An opening meeting with, each side in St. James1Palace as soon as possible after tbeir arrival, comprisinga general address toy the Prime Minister and very &quot;brief repliestoy the heads of delegations.(c) Procedure after that to toe settled in informaltalks with the Aratos and Jews on their arrival.PUBLICITY.(d) A United Kingdom Minister to toe responsltole for publicity,  assisted toy a principal Press Officer.(e) If possible, the ^rato and Jewish delegations to toe associated with this arrangement through a Press ^..\visoryCommittee or Committees.(f) The formal discussions to toe confidential, butbrief agreed communiques and background talks by theMinister or principal Press Officer to be given to the Press.ENTERTAINMENT.(g) Preparations to be made for a possible officialreception for both sides;    two separate official luncheonsfor the A-rab and Jewish sides, respectively;    and for smallluncheon or dinner parties for members of the Palestinian arab and Jewish delegations to be given by private individuals.(Intd.)
