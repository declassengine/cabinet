GERMANY. &apos; 1-        THE. SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN ..lFFAIRS(Previous reminded his colleagues that at the last Meeting of thte^Cabinet l&quot; Cabinet, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster hadelusion0^.) ashed the Foreign Office to consider circulating again?.3(3^)t      Paper on the situation as revealed in recent telegramsIti^)&apos;2--     from Berlin.,     He (the Foreign Secretary) had proposedthat the position should first he reviewed by theForeign Policy Committee,  and that a report should then be made to the Cabinet.A Meeting of the Foreign Policy Committee hadbeen held on Monday,  23rd January, at which a paper had been circulated containing a certain amount ofinformation based on secret sources.      The foreign secretary had asked that he might be excused fromcirculating this document, and that he might read tohis colleagues a statement based, on those reports.Before reading the statement, the foreign secretary said that the atmosphere was one of con-siderable uncertainty.      He thought that the cabinet should proceed on the assumption that the information which had been received might be true, although theremust, of course, be considerable doubt as to the realposition.      The atmosphere was much like that   whichsurrounded a child, in which everything was possible and nothing was impossible.  -The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs then read out the statement referred to,-&apos;&apos; sj^tement .is not reproduced inthe Cabinet Conclusions, but a copyhas been placed^ in the Secretary&apos;standard fileTJThe Secretary of State foriForeign Affairs addedthat the Polish Ambassador, whom heMiad recently seen on another matter,had reported to him that\iis general impression of the recent conversations at Berchtesgaden
between Herr Hitler and Colonel Beck was that Germany&apos;attitude was more pacific,-not-only in regard to Danzig,hut generallyoTHE PRIME MINISTER said he was sure the cabinet would appreciate that the procedure which had been adoptedin this matter was solely due to the need for keeping the circulation of extremely confidential Papers within the smallest possible limits.     There was no intention to with-hold information from the Cabinet.     He agreed with theForeign Secretary that the indications of Germany&apos;s possibleattitude could not be ignored, more especially since we mightbe dealing with a man whose actions were not rational.At the same time, the Prime Minister said, he wasa long way from accepting all this information.     some allowance must be made for the rather disturbing atmospherein which those who received these secret reports necessarilyworked.     Again, while many of the forecasts received fromthese sources had proved correct in the past, this was not always the case.     For example, quite recently he and theForeign Secretary had been told that on arrival in Romethey would be faced with a series of demands comparable with those encountered at Berchtesgaden.     This had not beenthe case.The Prime Minister also thought that it was somewhatcurious that the Flihrer should now be described as intenselyirritated at the result of Munich.     Further, it pointed tothe conclusion that, if a dictator was once baulked, it didnot mean that we should not hear of him again.      Indeed, itmight give rise to such annoyance and hostility on his partas to produce a situation which could only be ended, either by the defeat of the dictator in the field, or by internalrevolution.
The Prime Minister thought, moreover,  that itwas necessary to avoid paying too much attention to herr Hitler&apos;s speech on the 30th January.      His colleagues would remember how much trouble we had taken in september to make our attitude both clear and conciliatory, in viewof Herr Hitler&apos;s Nuremberg speech.The Prime Minister added that he had seen theGerman Ambassador on the previous day.     Dr. von Dirksenhad expressed his disbelief in these talks of pendingadventure on Herr Hitler&apos;s part.     Dr. von Dirksen thoughtthat Herr Hitler was devoting his energies to the economic sphere and had expressed satisfaction at the progressof negotiations now proceeding with representatives ofcertain of our industries:    e.g., the coal industry.Further, Dr. von Dirksen had recently been in Berlin andhad spoken to Herr von Ribbentrop, who had been seized ofthe importance of increasing German exports.    Dr. von Dirkserhad also expressed the view that the significance of the dismissal of Dr. Schacht could easily be over-emphasised.He suggested that Dr. Schacht had &quot;blotted his copy-book&quot;by over-frank expression of criticism, and that his dismissaldid not signify any important change in Germany&apos;s policy.The Prime Minister next referred to the suggestionthat it might be proposed that the Anti-Comintern Pact shouldbe converted into an offensive-defensive alliance.      Nodoubt there were people in Germany, Italy and Japan whowould like to see this happen, and it would be an unfortunatething for us.      There&apos; were, indeed, some people who said thatsuch an alliance had no?/ been concluded between these three powers and would be announced in the Fiihrer&apos;s speech on the30th January.     The Prime Minister thought that on this matterour attitude should be to wait and see what happened, while taking great care to avoid any action which would bring these three countries into a close alliance.
* S JpossibleGermanggressionagainstHolland.The Prime Minister said that within the last few days he had spent considerable time in discussion withthe representatives of the Labour Opposition, who favouredintervention in Spain, in the hope of saving Barcelonafrom General Franco&apos;s forces.     The folly of any such action at the moment was conspicuous, since it would encourageSignor Mussolini to conclude an alliance with Germany andThe Prime Minister said that there were anumber of specific points which should be discussed.The first was what action we should take in theevent of German aggression against Holland.     At therequest of the Foreign Policy Committee, the Chiefs of Staffprepared a Report on the matter (CP. SO (39)) which was before the Cabinet dealing with the following question: -&quot;Whether the integrity of Holland constitutesso vital a strategic interest to thiscountry that we should intervene in the eventof aggression by Germany against Holland.&quot;The Prime Minister thought that if Germanyattacked Holland, we should be bound to intervene, buthe doubted whether it was advisable that we should say soat once.     He was influenced by the fact that if we made an immediate statement to this effect, we should enter intoa binding commitment which, in certain circumstances, might prove embarrassing.     Further, Holland had not asked us forany such statement.      The Cabinet would remember thatrecently a rather similar issue had arisen in regard toFrance.     Should we enter into a binding undertaking to goto France^ assistance if she were attacked by any Powerseeing that France had undertaken to come to our assistance if we were attacked?     One obvious point was that france might be attacked from more than one quarter, whereas wewere only liable to be attacked by Germany, and that theobligations of mutual assistance in the event of attack
would not therefore, be equal0     We had already-madea statement that our obligations to Prance passedbeyond specific treaty obligations, but he woulddeprecate any attempt to define the position morenarrowlyo     For much the same reason, the Prime minister thought that for the moment it would be undesirable that we should enter into a precise and definiteobligation to intervene if Holland were attacked byGermany.In conclusion,  the Prime Minister pointed outthat the Chiefs of Staff were shortly to submit afurther paper dealing with the military action whichwe could take in defence of Holland&apos;s integrity, andhe thought it would sssenecessary to wait this furtherexpression of their views.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he had spentsome part of the Recess at the same hotel as the german ambassador.     The latter had sought opportunities tohave a number of long conversations with him.      It was of course conceivable that Dr. von Dirksen was notacquainted with Herr Hitler&apos;s plans, but he (the LordChancellor) was satisfied that Dr. von Dirksen was quite convinced in his own mind that there was no immediate trouble brewing, and that he personally wasin favour of peace.The Lord Chancellor then referred to thesuggestion that one of the matters which Herr hitler was considering was the reduction of armaments.      Ifthis was the case, he thought it would be of considerable assistance to Herr Hitler if we said that we should beready to consider reduction of armaments at some stage.The Lord Chancellor said that he had been much impressed by paragraph 17 of the Peace Plan of thexGerman Government of 31st March, 1936, and added thatx    see Cmd. 5175
dothisparticular paragraph had not been answered in thedespatch sent in reply thereto by the then foreign secretary on the 6th May,    1936?     He suggested that a communication might be sent to the German Government tothe effect that we had not considered this point at thetime but would be prepared to consider it now.The Lord Chancellor added that no objectioncould be taken to some of the points made by Herr Hitler,e.g. the abandonment of incendiary and gas bombs.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR thought that anyoffer by His Majesty&apos;s Government to consider disarmamentat the present time would be much misunderstood, both inthis country and by the world at large.Several members of the Cabinet referred to thefact that for some time past there had been a great dealof talk in the country very much on the general linesof the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.     THE MINISTER OFTRANSPORT said that there was also much talk to the   effectthat Herr Hitler had in mind an advance in the East, withthe object of splitting up Russia into a number of independent States.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said that,although he agreed that no immediate public statement shouldbe made as to our attitude in the event of German agfesessionagainst Holland, he assumed that this would not preventthe necessary preparations being made with the French and belgian Governments.     THE PRIME MINISTER agreed.Continuing, THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF trade said that it was significant that during the last fortnightmost of the information received had tended in the samedirection, namely, to increase the likelihood of someadventure in the West.     He suggested that there was a gooddeal to be said for making some public statement as to ouranxieties in the matter, thereby putting Herr Hitler en the* see Cmd, 5175 D
- defensiveo     In view of the volume of rumours which were now current in the country, it could not be said that sucha statement would impair public confidence.THE MINISTER PGR GO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCE saidthat the previous day he had seen the Chief of the naval staff and the Chief of the Air Steff.     They had both put tohim the point that, if the Government decided to act onthe assumption that the information referred to in theForeign Secretary&apos;s statement could not be ignored, thenw6 should at once start taking certain precautionary measures.     The Chief of the Naval Staff instanced workingup quietly certain ships which were not now in commission.A good deal could be done at the outset without attractingany publicity.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that, the   .moment we started to take certain precautionary steps, itwas inevitable that a larger number of persons should beinformed of what was apprehended, and there would almost certainly be some leakage.     He agreed with the PrimeMinister in thinking that thex^e was little advantage to be gained by making an immediate statement as to our interestin the integrity of Holland.     There was always thepossibility that such a statement might be used by herr hitler to suggest to the German people that we werethreatening them.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER thoughtthat what was immediately required was, not to make apublic statement of our attitude, but rather to concentrate on the acceleration of our defence preparations,,     While hewas convinced that Herr Hitler intended to carry out somecoup in the near future, he thought it was impossible to sayfor certain what the coup would be.     He thought that herr hitler intended to keep us all guessing.
soConversatiPns-tla Prance ao*1 Si urn,-&quot;evioua1&apos;ef erence:cabinet 2630 ) conclusion the SECRETARY OF STATS FOP HOME affairs referred to the need for -further Staff talks withthe French&apos;and Belgians.      If the Chiefs ofStaff took the view that we should intervene if germany attacked Holland, then there should also&quot;be Staff talks with the Dutch.THE SECRETLY OF STATE FOR AIR pointed outthat, when it had been proposed that the staff conversations with France should proceed on thebasis of war against Germany and Italy in combina-tion, it had been pointed out that there was always the danger that if this were done, news of it wouldleak through to Italy.     The result of this mightbe unfortunate.TIXG SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS addedthat we must not ignore the possibilities of a direct-attack by Germany on Belgium or on France, and hethought that our contacts with the French and belgian staffs should be made more definite.Thismatter had been discussed at the Committee ofImperial Defence on several occasions in recent months, but he thought that further action was still necessary to make these contacts more definite.It was agreed that this matter.should be further discussed by the Foreign Policy. Committee at its meeting to be held on the 26th January. /THE FIRST LORD OF THE! ADMIRALTY thought thatit was desirable that we should know what action the Dutch themselves would propose to take in theevent of invasion before definitely deciding upon our own action.     He would not be at all surprisedif a good deal of the information which had reachedthe Foreign Office through various sources had notbeen deliberately planted by Germany with, someulterior object.
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE exchequer:IJER was not in favour ofany immediate statement being made as to our attitudeif Germany attacked Holland.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS ANDFOR THE COLONIES was also opposed to any statement beingmade in the ver:/ near future.     He thought that sucha statement might not be acceptable to the Dutch, andthat it would be wrong to make it without consulting.,them.     Pie asked whether there had been any recentcontacts with the- Dutoh Ciovci iiiaivnl.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat there had been no very recent contact with theDutch Ambassador, though the Dutch Charge d&apos;Affaireshad been interviewed very recently.     The Dutch were very secretive and in the past had been strongly opposedto any action which might tend to cast doubt upon their neutrality, or to indicate that any Powers were unlikely to respect their neutrality.     For this reasonthey had opposed a suggestion that Germany shouldguarantee their neutrality.     He hoped, however, thatwhile the Cabinet r;ere opposed to an immediate statement as to our attitude in the event of Germany attcicklngHolland, they would not decide against such a statementof our intentions being made in any circumstances.   he agreed that if and when such a statement was made, itwould be necessary that we should have conversations with the Dutch as to the action which should be takenin defence of their country.The question of making some immediate approach to the Dutch Government had been considered by theForeign Policy Committee.     It had been felt, however,that if we made such an approach, the Dutch were likely
ft0to ask what action we proposed to take ourselves, andit was desirable, therefore, that we should first reach some decision on this point.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS ANDFOR THE COLONIES suggested that if an entirely informalapproach was made to Dr. Colijn by our Minister at TheHague this objection would not perhaps apply.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR,  referring to theConclusions of the Chiefs of Staff Report (CP. 20(39)),said it was clear that the Chiefs of Staff felt some doubt whether in the present state of our defence preparationswe were capable of any effective intervention.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affair&amp;S saidthat, notwithstanding this, he felt that in the event ofGerman aggression against Holland we should have activelyto intervene.A general discussion then ensued in regard to thestate of our defensive preparations as compared with theposition last September, and to the steps which could betaken to accelerate production.      The view generallyexpressed was that virtually all the action which could betaken to accelerate production over the next two or threemonths had already been taken, and that any extension ofthe range of our defensive preparations which it might nowbe necessary to consider could not affect the position inthe immediate future.In this connection,   THE SECRET--RY OF. ST. ..TE FOR AIR*in reply to a question by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster, said that it was doubtful whether the french would, in practice, attain the monthly figure of aircraft production which had been mentioned by the Freich Air &apos;Minister;    it was, however, significant that the position in
the Italian aircraft industry had recently deteriorated andthat no efforts had been made by Italy to improve theposition.     He also suspected that a number of persons hadbeen made unconscious instruments of German propaganda, andthat many of the statements circulated as to the german aircraft industry were exaggerations.Reference was made to the time which would elapse before the Territorial Anti-Aircraft Divisions could bemobilised.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said that most ofthe guns and searchlights could be moved out in twelvehours.     The position had recently been improved byadditions to the Regular personnel attached to the TerritorialAnti-Aircraft Divisions.    In this connection THE MINISTERFOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE referred to the statementrecorded in the Minutes of the 342nd Meeting of the Committeeof Imperial Defence held on the 22nd December on thequestion whether Germany could launch a surprise air attackon this country.      The Chief of the Air Staff wished to qualify somewhat the statement attributed to him in theminutes and he was submitting a statement on the point,The Cabinet agreed:-(l)    That, while there was little scope for acceleration of the defence programmes over the next two or threemonths, it was important to take all practicable steps to put the defence services into a state of readiness tomeet the contingency of a possibleemergency in the near future,(2)    To authorise the Foreign Policy Committeeto sanction proposals submitted to themby the Service Ministers, under (l)above, without further reference tothe Cabineto
(3)   That any decisions under (2)which may affect the ministers in charge of the Civil departments should he communicated direct to those departments by the Foreign PolicyCommittee.(4)   That the question whether(a) the scope of Staff conversations with the French and belgian governments should he extended, and(b) Staff Conversations with the dutch government should be initiated,should be considered by the ForeignPolicy Committee on the 26th January, 1939.(5)    To invite the Foreign Policy Committee toconsider, in the light of the further^    Report to be submitted by the Chiefs offCF-$fal&apos;)S&quot;.    Staff, our attitude in the event of aGerman invasion of Holland, and to report thereon to the Cabinet;    and that for thetime being no public statement should bemade as to our attitude in the event of aGerman invasion of Holland.(6)    That for the purpose of these discussions the Service Ministers and the Chiefs ofStaff should be invited to attend meetingsof the Foreign Policy Committee on the26th January, 1939.
65   jSTATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS TO THE CABINET.GERMANY.At the outset I would like to say that, howeverdisturbing the possibilities may be, there is no ground for extreme pessimism, or for a belief that we shall,  inthe near future, inevitably be the victims of a german attack.     While they would certainly welcome an easy victory,&apos;the German people as a whole do not want a prolonged war,for which (apart from war in the air) they are still verylargely unprepared.     There are, in fact, even now manyforces militating against the &quot;will to war&quot; of certainelements in the Dictator countries;    and it may well be that,in one way or another,  those forces will prevail.      At thesame time for the following reasons there are grounds for serious concern.There are periods in which our information aboutGermany from every source seems to point in a certaindirection.      Such a period was the three months thatpreceded the Munich settlement.      The exact extent to which herr Hitler was bluffing during that period will probablynever be known;    but all reports indicated that he definitelyintended to bring the Czech crisis to a head before the endof September.     Some little time after Munich, there began to appear a curious unanimity in the reports, which may be resumed as follows:-(1)   Herr Hitler had been at once encouraged andinfuriated by the Four Power settlement:    encouragedbecause he had after all absorbed the Sudetenland andgained a great strategical advantage;    infuriated because
he had to forego his &quot;quick war&quot; against an isolatedCzechoslovakia with all the glory and increase inprestige which would have come from such a victory.We know for a fact,  for instance, that his original intention was to occupy Prague and draw a &quot;strategicfrontier&quot; across Moravia.(2)   His exasperation had tended to focus itself onthe Prime Minister in particular and on Great Britain ingeneral.      In regard to the prime Minister (who had committed the unpardonable crime of having stolen someof the Puhrer&apos;s popularity in Germany) he was reported as constantly making depreciatory remarks.     As for england, she was both decadent and the arch-enemy.He was reported as saying on 9th November, 1938:I&quot;Conditions are all against an Anglo-German understanding;!If Foreign Powers will not meet German demands, thenGermany will take for herself what she cannot get by negotiation.&quot;     About the same time Herr von Ribbentropremarked:      &quot;If no agreement with England can be reached,he (the Fiihrer) is determined not to shrink from war inorder to destroy her.&quot;   The desire at once to counterMr. Chamberlain&apos;s popularity in Germany and to make an anglo-German understanding almost impossible was probablyone of the principal reasons for the persecution of theJews.(3)   Herr Hitler&apos;s exasperation was fanned by thesteadily worsening economic situation in Germany duringthe last quarter of 1938, notably in regard to increasing difficulties in obtaining raw materials, both for armaments and for other purposes.      There is no doubtthat after Munich all his expert advisers told him that,from the economic point of view, he should consolidate
the position and curtail his public works and armaments expenditure.(4)    For this reason,  if for no other,  it seemed likely that the Fuhrer,  if he failed to listen to hisexperts&apos;  advice, with all the effects on Germany&apos;srelative military strength which the adoption of such advice would entail, would be forced, during 1939, to&quot;explode&quot;  in some direction.    The objects of such an&quot;explosion&quot; would be to distract attention from thefailure of his system to work in time of peace;&quot; to provide!an excuse for suppressing the German &quot;Moderates&quot;; and nodoubt also - perhaps mainly - to secure by physical force the vast supplies of raw materials which Nazi germany could no longer procure by legitimate methods of trade.(5)    Nevertheless,, until towards the end of the year(with the exception of one report from a slightly suspectsource that Herr Hitler had said in November &quot;What do I need colonies for when in a year&apos;s time Belgium and holland will be mine, and shortly afterwards England?&quot;)there was no evidence that such an&quot;explosion&quot; would occurelsewhere than in the East.    Colour was lent to this latter theory by the vigour with which the Nazis seemed tobe championing the cause of Ukrainian independence; by the obvious nervousness of the Poles, who even made approaches to Soviet Russia; and by the fact that it would be morelogical, and more in accordance with the principles of&quot;Mein Kampf&quot; for the Nazis first to exploit the East andthen turn, reinforced, upon the West.Unfortunately, towards the end of the year, and during the present month, we began to receive reportsthat the minds of the rulers of Germany were moving in adifferent, and for us a more sinister, direction.    Thus,
shortly before Christmas we heard that, according to a prominent young Nazi leader,  the Fuhrer had declared at a recent meeting of minor leaders at Munich that &quot;TheseEnglish, arrogant apes that they are, think that they canrule the world for ever with 15 battleships.    They won&apos;t,however.    Our Air Force, and the German and Italian U.Boats will take care of that.&quot;    If an understanding &quot;onour terms&quot;  (continued our informant) did not come one day,the Fuhrer would arrange for a general crisis in which germany,  Italy and Japan would simultaneously play theirparts and produce a triple edition of the Czech crisis.&quot;Under certain circumstances, that should come about theend of January or in February, and then you will see howChamberlain and Daladier will again fly to Berchtesgaden,to the accompaniment of a laughable howl from their LeftPress.&quot;Some colour is given to this by the fact that only two days ago we received information from an absolutely certain source to the effect that Germany atthe end of December was pressing for the conversion of the anti-Comintern Pact into a Pact of which the signatorieswould guarantee military assistance to any of them who wasthe subject of unprovoked attack by a third Power.    It isreported that Italy has agreed to this.    Japan is stillconsidering the matter, and Germany is pressing her fora decision, as it is hoped to announce the new Pact inthe speech which Herr Hitler may make on January 30th.A little later a most reliable source (uncon-consious that his remarks would be repeated) said thateverybody in the inner circles of the Party was convincedthat there would be a war, at the earliest in March,  atthe latest in April.    The reason for this belief was because the Fuhrer   was thought to be influenced to an
increasing extent &quot;by what is called &quot;S. S. Tactic&quot; .  i.e. ,&quot;by the notions of Hirartiler and Ribbentrop.    Brieflyexpressed this conception is &quot;Simply get on with it&quot;.Being interpreted this, according to our informant, amounts&apos;to a simultaneous attack in the East and against theY/estern Powers.    Even if England acquiesced in Germany&apos;sEastern action she would,  according to this theory,  stillbe attacked.About the middle of December we received information from a highly placed German that a plan for a completely surprise air attack on London was being studied.We have, however, nothing to show that Herr Hitlerhas definitely .adopted this plan.A further report has come in during the last ten days from a very high German source which has alwaysproved reliable in the past.    According to this report about January 12th not only Dr.  Schacht, but also theFinance Minister, Count von Krosigk, sent memoranda to herr Hitler describing the internal situation asdesperate and saying that there were only tv/o possibleremedies:    (l) a drastic cutting down of public expenditure, and (2) a large increase in taxation. Further-more, the technical Head of the Ministry of Economics madeat about the same time a confidential speech to a hundred industrialists which was full of open criticism of the present state of affairs.    Herr Brinkmannexpressed the view that the budget would have to be cut down by six billion marks.    The lack of raw material was so great that in a few weeks there wo\ild be a breakdown in Germany. &quot;The plunder of Austria was exhausted!and the last loan had been largely uncovered in spite ofthe heaviest financial pressure.    Herr Brinkmann said that
all this was the first sign of coming catastrophe andlike Dr.  Schacht and Count von Krosigk he urged the strictest control not only of State &quot;but also of Partyexpenditure.    To all these criticisms Herr Hitler had in substance replied:    &quot;Very well.    All this means that the&quot;vital decision must come at once, and it is coming atprominent officers that it was not only a question of&quot;once.&quot;    He then added to a gathering of/conquest, hut ofthe destruction of Christianity (which was only anotherform of Judaism) and the foundation of a new philosophywhich would destroy the Democracies and rule the world.At the conclusion of this address some of the officerspresent thought him madder than ever.    It seems, however,that the General Staff has now &quot;been instructed tofurnish the Ftlhrer by the 15th February with plans for(l) an attack on the East;  and (2) a combined attackon Holland and Switzerland, which would involvesimultaneous action against England and France.    Someof those who have received these instructions believethat the attack on the East is bluff and that thereal attack is to be on the West. Tn any case herr hitler seems to be relying on the advice of Ribbentropmore than on that of anybody else and Ribbentropis alleged to be dominated by his hatred of England.At the end of the Munich Conference, for instance,he is reliably reported to have said:    &quot;Gentlemen,the obituary notice of England is on the table.&quot;It is perhaps worth while mentioning at thispoint that at the beginning of January we received fromquite another source a report that in view of thefinancial position Herr Hitler intended to order
*1 -9i JLmobilisation about the middle of February on the dutch and Swiss frontiers.    His intention was to terrorise thewestern countries with threats, and,  if necessary, byinvading Holland and perhaps part of Switzerland and holding them as a pledge until his demands were met infull.    These demands would include measures to solveGermany&apos;s financial problem.    We also know that theFrench and Belgian General Staffs have both received information of a German plan of campaign to seizeHolland, at all events north of the Rhine, with a view to obtaining a base for submarine warfare against GreatBritain.    Both the French and Belgian General Staffsbelieve that a plan to the effect has recently been studied!!at Aachen by the German General Staff, and I also under-stand that General Gamelin spoke on these lines to theSecretary of State for War in Paris on the 21st january and added that there were already German concentrationson the Dutch frontier. -Finally, a certain confirmation of pessimisticrumours may well be found in the dismissal of Dr.  Schacht,and the exile of Captain Weidemann.-7 There is also the strong rumour that,  in his recent talk with Colonel Beck,Herr Hitler endeavoured to buy Poland&apos;s neutrality bypromising her a share of Germany&apos;s colonial spoils.I conclude my summary of these disturbingreports on the same note as I began it.    We have very definite indications that Herr Hitler may be contemplatingan attack on the West during the coming spring, andpossibly as early as the second part of February; butwe have no proof that the Fuhrer has definitely committedhimself to such action.    All that can be said withpractical certainty is that an &quot;explosion&quot; of Germany is
likely to come in the comparatively near future and thatit is necessary for us to take immediate measures toguard against the possibility of its being directed against us.At the Foreign Policy Committee of the cabinet it was then decided that,  apart from accelerating tothe utmost our defensive and counter-offensivepreparations, there were certain other measures thatmight be considered.In the first place it was decided that we shouldtake the President of the United States fully into our confidence,  telling him of our apprehensions and of such measures as we are able to take to avert or counteraggressive action by Germany.A telegram with this object has already beensent to Washington.    The Secretary of State then readextracts from the despatch, a copy of which is attached.A similar communication is of course also beingmade to the Dominion Prime Ministers.The Committee at the same time approved proposalsfor action in the realm of propaganda, with a view to bringing home to the population of Germany thewantonness and folly of any aggressive move on the partof their Government.    Progress is being made with these plans which cover a variety of different methods of approach.Ore of the possible lines of action on which herr hitler might decide - an invasion of Holland - of courseraises a political question of the first magnitude:-is the integrity of the Netherlands a vital interest ofthis country, and should such an invasion be held to befor us a casus belli?     The Chiefs of Staff have prepared a paper on this point, on which I hope the Cabinet!!
i *3may be able to reach, an early decision.It will probably be necessary for us tocommunicate that decision to the United States Government,with whom we should keeo in constant touch.-In the light of that decision, we shall have toconsider what communication we.should make to the French,Belgian and Dutch Governments.We shall have to consider in the event of our&apos; deciding that we should have to intervene on an invasion of Holland, whether or not it would be desirableto give some public hint or statement to that effecton the lines of the statement made by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer in   regard to Belgium in July, 1932.Pending a decision on the major point, we are doing what we can, but further action, which should not be delayed,  if possible,  for more than days,  is dependenton that decision, and I therefore very much hope that wecan arrive at it without loss of time.
(pain.efugees.previous reference:Cabinet 1IP) Oon-elusion2.      THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat it would shortly he necessary to bring before theCabinet our position vis-a-vis non-intervention..     Theonly matter of immediate importance concerned the supply offood to refugees.     Up to now we had, on two occasions,subscribed  10,000 to the International Commission.     Asfr^&apos;3^&quot;3^ aerainst this, the sums given or promised by other foreigncountries were as follows:-Sweden        * * -      . * -United States of America,contributions in kindvalued at a. o 50,000 60,000 a month (forthe next6 months).Belgium       ...       -.-  15,000.Norway and Denmark       each      10,000.Considerable pressure would be brought to bear on theForeign Office for a further contribution by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had saidthat he was willing to agree to a further contribution of 20,000.     His own view was that these demands would continueto be made upon us, and that we should have to meet them.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER did not dissent from the view expressed by the Foreign Secretary, exceptthat his understanding of the matter was that the sumsmentioned by the Foreign Secretary represented in large partnot contributions made, but contributions promised.In re-ply to the Prime Minister, who asked whether there was any risk that these contributions would relieveGeneral France from the obligations which would normallyfall on the authority responsible for the administration ofa conquered territory, THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that hethought that the help now proposed was justified, not only
on merits, &quot;but on the ground, that it would he welcomed&quot;by both parties.THE FIRST LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY read a telegramdespatched at midnight from H.M.S. DEVONSHIRE accordingto which the fall of Barcelona was imminent and that the seat of Government was being moved to Gerona.It was explained that although the Commissionstarted by dealing only with Child Refugees its scope hadinevitably been extended to refugees generally.The Cabinet approved the proposedfurther contribution of  20,000to the International Commission forthe Assistance of Child Refugees in spain.
3.        THE SECRETARY OR STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs reminded his colleagues that at the previous Meeting,the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequerand he had &quot;been authorised to settle the termsof the communication to he addressed to the UnitedStates Government, informing them that we were considering further the question of financialassistance to China, and asking for some furtherindication of their parallel action.    This telegram had been despatched but no reply had yet been received.In the meanwhile the Central ExecutiveCommittee of the China Government, and General Chiang-Kai-Shek, had pressed urgently for a reply to their request to us on this matter, which had first beenput forward in November last.    Hitherto the only .assistance that we had accorded to the ChineseGovernment had been a promise to make available a credit of  500,000 for lorries when the Export CreditsBill passed into law.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs proposed that our Ambassador in China should beauthorised to tell General Chiang-Kai-Shek (a) thatwhen the Export Credits Bill passed into law we hoped to allot a further credit to China, and (b) that.wewere also considering the question of a Currency Loan,but that our position in this matter had been mademuch more difficult by the attitude of the ChineseGovernment in regard to the Customs Loans.    In thisconnection he added that we had already requested theChinese Government to implement the arrangement of the2nd May and that they had informed him that they hoped to be able to meet us on this point.The Cabinet approved the action proposed tobe taken by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs in regard to the questionof financial assistance to China.-15-
SPEECHES BY 4.      THE PRIME MINISTER said that at the presentMINISTERS ONFOREIGN time, when public attention was focussed on foreignAFFAIRS.affairs, it was clear that Ministers would find itnecessary to make some references to foreign affairs(previous reference:       in the speeches which they delivered in the country.Cabinet 42(36), Con-       jje asked his colleagues, if they proposed to includeelusion 12. )in their speeches statements on foreign affairs,F?. 15&quot;(24)h- to submit the text of what they desired to say to theForeign Office in advance.The Cabinet agreed that this procedure should be adopted, and also that theMembers of the Cabinet should bring this conclusion to the notice of theirrespective Parliamentary Under Secretaries.(The Secretary was instructed to inform other ministers of the decision.)
PALESTINE.The Military-Situation.(previous reference:Cabinet 1(39), Con-clusion 4).invitations to theLondonConference.5.        THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE colonies said that he had now circulated a lengthy Memorandumdealing with our policy in Palestine.    But this paper would he considered by the Palestine committee before being discussed by the full Cabinet.The military situation in Palestine wasunchanged.    The Chief of the Imperial General staff would be visiting that country during his tour ofthe Middle East and would be able, on his return, tosubmit a report of General Haining&apos;s views.The Mufti had at last agreed to two membersof the Nashashibi^being included in the delegation of Palestine Arabs.    This represented a considerable success.    It subsequently appeared, however, that of theVA.^r Hts^.-two persons 3a*/had nominated one man was seriously ill,and the other had left the Nashashibi Party and joined the Mufti&apos;s faction some months ago.    This was most fortunate.    Instructions had been sent toSir Miles Lampson to get into direct touch withRagheb Nashashibi and ask him to nominate two people to represent his Party.    It was hoped that a solution might be arrived at on these lines.The Secretary of State, however, was afraid that difficulties would arise^    It would then benecessary to settle whether to drop the idea of separate representation of the. Nashashibi DefencePar&quot;ty or to obtain a DGpai&quot;ato Delegation representingthat Party.    He thought that it would probably benecessary to adopt the latter course, since theDefence Party were now growing in influence and itwas important that we should not give the impression that we had failed to support them.The Cabinet took note of this statement.
She GOVERNMENT 6. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by,2g35^DlA ACT*-   the Secretary of State for India (CP.  9 (39))recalling that at the Meeting mentioned in theJill to amend. margin colleagues had approved in principle thesi;jsPrevious introduction early this year of a Bill to amendfeference: *Conclusion 6^)&apos;in certain essential and urgent particulars the,    i Government of India Act, 1935.    Since that Meeting., is (uf^O&apos;.      the Government of India, who had recently devotedattention to the legislative and other measures whichwould be required in India in the event of war, had pressed very strongly the need for further amendmentof the Act in respect of (i) the powers of theCentral Government to control, direct and co-coordinate the actions of Provincial Governments and actionin the Provinces generally;    (ii) Customs;    andcertain other minor matters.    The Secretary ofState attached to his Memorandum a draft newSection (126A) to deal with (i) above.After the Secretary of State for India had explained the proposals set out in. the Memorandum,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS said thathe was somewhat surprised at the request of theGovernment of India to introduce legislation forth-with, dealing with the powers of the CentralGovernment in emergency.    We had been faced with much the same issue in this country, and we had decided that it was better not to introduceemergency legislation in peace-time, for fear that parliament might restrict the emergency powers which were regarded as essential in time of war.
THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR INDIA replied thatthe Government of India felt that if there was tobe trouble with the Provincial Governments, theywould rather have the trouble now than on theoutbreak of war.    Further, the Government of Indiasaid that they were unable to make adequatepreparations without the oo-operation of theProvincial Governments.    It was therefore essentialto let the Provincial Governments know what theposition would be in time of war.    He added thatthe proposal.had the approval of the Indian aswell as the British members of the Viceroy&apos;council.THE PRIME MINISTER said that although theymight feel some misgiving in regard to theGovernment of India&apos;s proposal, he thought thatthe Cabinet must accept it.The Cabinet agreed:-To approve the course proposed bythe Secretary of State for indian CP.  9 (39),
m0*.0 Xfew CONSTRUCTION&amp;0GRAMME, 1939.[eviousIference 5[binet 53 (38)Inclusion 2A. )7.      The Cabinet had under consideration aMemorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty(CP.  14 (39)), proposing the following new construction Programme for 1939:-2 Capital Ships1 Aircraft Carrier4 Cruisers16 Destroyers4 Submarines20 Fast Escort Vessels3 Escort Vessels (Normal Type)10 Minesweepers1 Fast Minelayer1 Motor Torpedo Boat Depot Ship2 River Gunboats1 Hospital Ship12 Motor Torpedo Boats2 Boom Defence vessels Fleet Target Service Tug, and miscellaneous Small Craft.The First Lord attached to his Memorandum a table showing the financial effect of his proposals.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY made astatement in explanation of the proposals.     Asregards Capital Ships, he had agreed to consult theTreasury before the second Capital Ship was laid down.It was seen from paragraph 3 that there was a case for laying down more Capital Ships, but at themoment it was impossible to build more.The second destroyer flotilla would not belaid down until later in the year. .   It would consistof somewhat smaller ships and he hoped to save some 800,000 on the estimates.All the Commanders-in-Chief at the time ofthe September crisis had pressed for more small ships.      He was satisfied that the number of destroyers now proposed was the minimum which couldbe justified.     Of our 185 destroyers, 45 were twenty years old or more, and 18 others were nineteen years old.      Destroyers became officially &quot;over-age&quot; at16 years old.,
0 o0 ^The two submarine minelayers would be similar tothe &quot;S&quot; type and this would result in a saving of  200,000.It was proposed to lay down twenty fast escort vessels and three escort vessels of the normal type.     the fast escort vessels were for work with the Fleet and fastconvoys and had a limited range.     Hitherto we had onlybuilt 30 of these vessels, and the Naval Staff were anxious for 60 or 70 ships of this type.     The fast minelayer anddefied *3/vJ/0the motor tftiPpa&amp;a boa-^/represented new types of vessels.The latter would be employed for overhauling the motortorpedo boats and would, it was hoped, greatly improve theservice given by these boats.The river gunboats were required for service inChina to replace vessels twenty-two years old.The Chancellor had pressed him to make reductions,particularly in regard to the three escort vessels of thenormal type.     He would be reluctant to drop any of these vessels, but if strongly pressed, he would agree to dropone.     He would also agree if necessary to drop four motorvessels, although these vessels were.very useful for use against submarines and aggressive tactics.THE CHANCELLOR CP THE EXCHEQUER said that he had gone into the programme carefully and done his best to meetthe First Lord&apos;s difficulties.     He had no comments to make as regards the larger vessels, although he felt bound toput on record that he did not accept the statement in thefirst sentence of paragraph 6 of the First Lord&apos;sMemorandum.     On general grounds he felt somewhat disquietedthat whereas new /types of vessels were added to the Fleet,the old types continued.     Surely the introduction of new types should render possible countervailing economieselsewhere.     He hoped that the First Lord would be able to effect a larger reduction than he had suggested.
THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY referred to theproposal to build a new Royal Yacht to replace the victoria and Albert.     This matter had been submitted tothe..Cabinet by his predecessor, and had been approved.It was proposed to lay down this vessel in the latesummer.     He hoped that the new vessel would have a considerably lower complement than the 380 complement ofthe Victoria and Albert but he was enquiring further intothis matter.    In thin connection he mentioned that it hadbeen necessary to apend  60,000 on fitting up His Majesty&apos;eShip &apos;Repulse&apos;  for the Royal Visit to Canada,In the course of discussion, it was pointed outttiat when this matter had previously been discussed,the importance had been emphasised of avoiding thepossibility that the construction of the Yaoht mightexpose the King to criticism-,     It was, perhaps,unfortunate that under present plans the ship would belaid down at a time when the serious financial positionas a result of the growing expenditure on defence wouldbe becoming generally known.     On these grounds alone,it was suggested that it might perhaps be desirableto hold the proposal in abeyance for the time being.It was also explained that one reason whichhad been advanced in support of the proposal to build anew Royal Yacht was that it should be possible to effect a very considerable saving on the complement of the Yacht.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY also said that there wouldtoe considerable public advantage if the King was in aposition when, for example, cruising in the Royal Yachtin the Mediterranean, to pay calls at various Mediterraneanports.     This view met with general concurrence.The Cabinet were also reminded that the Yachtcould in time of emergency be used as a hospital ship.
The Cabinet approved the New construction programme for 1939, as set out by the FirstLord of the Admiralty in his memorandum(CP. 14 (39)), subject to further discussion between the Prime Minister, the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the First Lord of theAdmiralty of the points raised at themeeting.
ARMOUREDFIGHTINGVEHICLES.Practice Rangefor.Report of cabinet committee.(previous reference cabinet 54(38), Con-clusion 9).8.      The Cabinet had before them the following documents:-A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor War (CP.   244 (38)) asking for authority to purchase land at LinneyHead, Pembrokeshire, for the con-struction of a practice range forarmoured fighting vehicles:The Report of the Cabinet Committee(CP.  12 (39)) appointed at theMeeting mentioned in the margin toconsider the above proposal.    Theconclusion reached by the Committeewas that no other course was open tothem than to recommend the Cabinetto approve the purchase of the LinneyHead site.    They suggested, however, thata statement should be incorporated inany public announcement to the effectthat the decision in favour of theWar Office proposal was only reachedafter exhaustive enquiry by theGovernment had shown that no alterna-tive site would meet the requirementsof an armoured fighting vehicles range;and, further, that urgent defence needswere the paramount consideration which made it necessary in this case to over-ride agricultural and amenity considerations.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF defence said that the Committee had examined the possibilitiesof 25 alternative sitesn    The only three sites whichwere not open to insuperable objections were -(l) Linney Head.(2) Kirkbean.(3) A site on the Northumberland moors.The last named site, however, was very boggy,and would probably require metalled runs which wouldbe very expensive.The Kirkbean site had much greaterpossibilities but the ground was regarded asunsuitable by the War Office and was not large enoughto afford sufficient training facilities.    Reluctantly,therefore, the Committee had come to the conclusionthat, notwithstanding that the Kirkbean site was much cheaper,  the Linney Head site should be chosen.
In the course of discussion, it was pointedout that a larger area of land at Kirkbean might beobtained by extension to the west, but that the WarOffice objected to this western land because it wasflat and would not provide adequate facilitiesfor realistic practice.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH said that he had notbeen wholly convinced that, notwithstanding the factthat the Kirkbean site was definitely a second bestfrom the War Office point of view, the War office could not accept it as a reasonable site.THE SECRETARY OF STATE. FOR DOMINION affairs and THE COLONIES asked whether it would not be possibleto make alterations to the low lying land at Kirkbeanin order to make the practice more realistic.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA againreminded his colleagues that the National Trust were very much interested in Linney Head and he was afraid that the occupation of this site by the War office would result in an outcry.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that theinformation as to the possibility of extending theKirkbean site did not appear to be altogetherconsistent with the statement in page 9 of theReport that Kirkbean only provided range accommodation for only one unit at a time.After further discussion, the PRIMEMINISTER proposed and the Cabinet- agreed:-(l) That the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence, the Secretary of State forWar and the Minister of Health should again examine the possibilities of theKirkbean site, with particular referenceto the question whether the extensionof the area to the west could be made into a reasonably satisfactory rangesite for a second unit, steps beingtaken, if practicable, to effectimprovements to the terrain:
(2) That the Report of these three ministers should he submitted to the Prime minister who should be authorised to reach adecision on the matter without further reference to the Cabinet.
Q OGoWAR RISKS. 9.     The Cabinet had under consideration aMemorandum hy the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP.17Compensationand Insurance.(39)) on the subject of War Risks (Compensation and(Previous Insurance), on which it would be necessary to makeReference:Cabinet 59     a full statement regarding the Government&apos;s plans(38), Con-clusion 9.)    as soon as the House re-assembled.    The Chancelloroutlined in his Memorandum a comprehensive schemefor dealing with damage to essential goods, and submitted the following proposals for the approval ofthe Cabinet:-(a) That the Government scheme for insuringstocks against air raid risks should beapplied to essential commodities alone(Paragraph 11).(b) That this insurance should extend as faras stocks in the hands of merchants, butnot to stocks in the hands of retailers(paragraph 12).(c) That on balance the scheme should be, compulsory;1. e. , that essential stocks held during thewar must come under the government scheme (Paragraphs 14 and 16).On the question of compensation for personalinjuries of civilians caused by-enemy action, and compensation for damage to property, while theChancellor agreed that the proposed announcement should be in general terms, he thought it would bedifficult to refuse to give details .of the scope ofthe scheme, and the classes of civilians to whom itwould apply, but that the scale of compensation to.be granted to civilians should be kept secret.Attached as Appendix II to the Chancellor&apos;sMemorandum was a short statement, suitable for inclusion in the comprehenisve announcement to be madein Parliament, on the scheme for re-insuring againstKing&apos;s Enemy risks (a).United Kingdom ships, and(b) cargoes consigned to and from the United Kingdom.
6 uTHE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER circulated to theCabinet a copy of the draft statement on this matter whioh -had been prepared.     This statement is appended to the Minutesas an Append la. The Cabinet went through the draft statement paragraph by paragraph.The main point on which discussion turned wasthe exclusion from the scheme of insurance of essentialstocks in the hands of retailers.      It was suggested bythe SECRETARY OP STATE POR AIR that it might be argued that the exclusion of retailers would hit the very people who were least in a position to bear losses resultingfrom air attack.     As against this it was pointed out thatthe whole object of the scheme was to ensure that the flow of goods into the country was not stopped as a result ofthe absence of any scheme for insurance of stocks in thehands of e.$. importers and manufacturers.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER pointed out thatit was necessary to work the scheme through insurance companies, and the Insurance Companies had said that theycould not administer the scheme if it included retailers.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that, as he understood the matter, the scheme of compensation for propertymentioned on page 2 of the draft statement was not confined to houses and would cover stocks in the.hands of retailers.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER agreed that thiswas so, and it was suggested that certain passages in thedraft statement would require amendment to meet this point.In this connection the LORD PRIVY SEAL referredto the sentence on page 4 - &quot;an equally vital problem isthat of stock-in-trade&apos;1.Reference was made to the fact that compensationfor property generally would not be payable until thetermination of hostilities.     THE MINISTER OF HEALTH
suggested that it would be necessary to make clear that someinterim payment might he found necessary in respect of thedestruction by air bombardment of stocks in the hands ofretailers, in order to keep trade moving.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE said that itwould be necessary to add a paragraph on page 2 dealing withthe position of merchant seamen.     This was agreed to.The President also referred to the position of insurance of cargoes.     At the time of the September crisisthe war risks policies in respect of cargoes, which wereterminable at forty-eight hours&apos; notice, had been determinedand the underwriters had quoted ever rising rates.     In theend, these rates were virtually prohibitive and brought tradealmost to a standstill.     If another emergency arose thePresident thought that it would be essential to get into toujhat once with the underwriters, and to discuss the matter withthem on the assumption that the scheme for war risks insurancewould receive Parliamentary authority later.The President of the Board of Trade asked that ifsuch a situation arose he might be authorised to approach the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer and,subject to their approval, to proceed accordingly0THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought it warclearly necessary that the President should have this authority from the Cabinet.The Cabinet agreed;(l)    To approve the proposals (a), (b) and (c)in paragraph 18 of CP. 17 (59) &apos;Set out above, subject to the settlement of outstanding points between the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the President of theBoard of Trade, the Secretary of State forAir and tne Minister of Healths(2)    That, if an emergency appears to beimminent, the President of the Board ofTrade should be authorised, subject to theapproval of the Prime Minister and theChancellor of the Exchequer, to take thenecessary steps to bring into operation ascheme for the insurance of cargoes againstwar risks, on the lines of the schemecontemplated in the draft legislation, onthe assumption that the necessary iegislat&amp;ireauthority would be obtained later,- 29 -

The Committee had reached the conclusionthat the exceptional powers of interrogation conferred by Section S of the Act of 1920 (on which recentcriticism had been concentrated) could be modified with-out detriment to the interests of the State.

DEER AND GROUNDGAilS (SCOTLAND)BILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 2(38), Con-clusion 8.)12.     The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum&quot;by the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. -11 (39))seeking the authority of his colleagues for the submission, to the Committee of Home Affairs of aDeer and Ground Game (Scotland) Bill.     after explaining the provisions of the proposed Bill, theSecretary of State suggested that it would be advantageous to introduce it in the House of Lords.The Cabinet approved the submission of this Billto the Home Affairs Committee.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.,25th January, 1939,
Mr. Speaker,  I take this opportunity with your permission and with the leave of the House, tostate the conclusions reached toy the Government onthe subject of compensation from public funds inrespect of loss or injury caused to persons orproperty in this country arising from enemy action,such as &quot;bombardment from the air or from the sea, orfrom counter-action taken against any such attacks.The general principle which the Government thinkshould be applied is that such loss or injury ought not to be treated as merely the concern of those whodirectly suffer it, but must be regarded as fallingupon the community as a whole and consequently as constituting a proper subject for compensation from public funds.      In other words,  the loss ought not tobe left to lie where it happens to fall, for the risk is one which affects us all alike,  and the particularperson or particular property which is struck is thecasual victim of a general peril which the State is engaged in doing its utmost to resist and counteract.The Government have therefore had underconsideration arrangements for giving compensation from public funds in respect of death or of injuryinvolving serious disablement caused by air raids orother warlike action.     A scheme is being worked out to cover casualties to civilians,  its purport being that,  in addition to persons enrolled asvolunteers in air raid or other such services who might be injured or killed while on duty, the scheme
would apply to casualties among civilians wholly or mainly dependent for their livelihood upon their employment or occupation.     Provision will also haveto he made in the scheme for other cases where needarises.The rate of compensation for personsinjured or for dependent widows or children of personskilled would, broadly speaking, be calculated by reference to the standard rate of compensation andto the conditions applicable to the private soldierrecruited for service in connection with the samehostilities.As regards the various types of private property - houses, furniture, factories, stock in trade, etc., the problem presents many grave complica-tions.     The suggestion has been made that theGovernment might institute an insurance scheme,collecting premiums from owners and undertaking topay in full for any subsequent damage whatever may beits extent.     This proposal has been exhaustivelyexamined, and the insuperable difficulty is that nopossible basis for an actuarial calculation exists.If the total damage was slight,  then no doubt the compulsory exaction of a substantial premium from every owner of private property in the country at regular intervals might over a,/prolonged period buildup a sufficient fund, though the management of such a fund v/ould present difficulties of its own.      But,equally,  if the damage was heavy and prolonged, thefund so built up might be wholly inadequate,  and toavoid this risk as far as possible premiums might haveto be raised to a figure not generally acceptable and
not suitable for compulsory and universal collection.It is these considerations, no doubt, which have led the insurance companies to decline this class of insurance, for the risk is not in fact an insurableproposition.      The Government,  therefore,  cannotcontemplate a scheme which would commit the community to so vague and indeterminate a liability.      that does not mean in the least that individual propertieswhich suffer ought to be left to bear the lossunaided, but that the compensation should be on thehighest scale compatible with the circumstances ofthe country after and not before a conflict.     Whenthe extent of the damage to property in private ownership is known,  such contribution will be made from public funds as the circumstances make possible,in accordance with a scale which would at any ratepay in full up to a certain limit of loss and there-after would be graded.     Although compensation cannotbe made available until the total losses are known atthe end of such a conflict,  it would be necessary to assess damage as soon as possible after it occurred in each case,  and a scheme has been drawn up for thispurpose which can be put into operation immediately itis - required.There will be a compensation board preside over by one of His Majesty&apos;s Judges and thecollection .of claims and recording of damage will bein the hands of the Valuation Department of the InlandRevenue as a nucleus with additional professionalassistance.      The Government appreciate that in theabsence of formal insurance various questions affecting the relations between freeholders,  lease-holders and other persons interested in property must
Q7be specially dealt with.      These problems havebeen examined by a Committee appointed by theLord Chancellor, the report of which will bepublished immediately.I have dealt so far with private property in general but I must now mention certainparticular problems.     The necessary deferment ofcompensation until the end of the emergency wouldin the absence of special steps resxilt in the holding up of necessary repairs to essentialproperty which has been damaged.     Accordingly a -plan has been worked out for the emergencyreconstruction of essential property includingwhere necessary housing accommodation.An equally vital problem is that of stockin trade.      That is quantitatively a very much smaller problem than that of property in generalbut from the point of view of the community as awhole it is vital to secure the. continued flow of necessary supplies to this country upon which ourexistence during the emergency would largely depend.Such imports are financed on the basis that theywill be disposed of in due course after being brought here.      If they are destroyed by enemy action the private finance to import other goods intheir place may not be available.Our plans in this connection are two-fold.In the first place we shall shortly announce a comprehensive scheme for marine war risks.      Theprinciple of the scheme is that firms customarilyoffering insurance of such risks will form a pooland the pool will be able to reinsure King&apos;s Enemy
risks with the Government.      This scheme is designedto operate with the necessary adjustments,  in timeof war;    hut also to operate in time of peace, withthe special object that by giving complete cover toall engaged in trade there should be no check tothe flow of goods into and out of the country during any period of anxiety or emergency.      Thescheme will be extended so as to cover not onlygoods on ship but goods between ship and warehouse.As regards essential stocks on land we have found it practicable to devise an insurance plan.This will cover all goods which in the opinion ofthe Board of Trade are essential to the life of thecommunity during war including the maintenance ofthe export trade.      The scheme will be worked throughthe fire insurance companies including Lloyds.     Asthe owners of such   goods will receive compensation in full immediately,  a premium will be charged,   inwar.      There will be no premium in peace, but itwill be necessary for the persons concerned to register at a nominal fee sufficient to coverexpenses with, their insurer and t-hey will be allowedto ask for endorsements of their policies as required from time to time.      In war the scheme would becompulsory and the foe for delayed registration wouldbe increased.      This scheme will cover all goods ofthe class I have mentioned whether they are rawmaterials,  commodities or in course of manufacture and the scheme applies to importers, manufacturers and merchants but not to goods in the hands ofretailers or of course goods held by consumers.
