1 I  FOR WAR) PEACEDEPOSES.PreviousHeference:Cabinet 5(39), Con-clusion 10),1B      The Cabinet resumed their discussion onthe subject of Camps for v/ar and Peace Lurposes,which had been adjourned at the Meeting the same morning, and again had before them the Joint Memo-randum by the Lord Privy Seal, the Secretary ofState for Scotland, the i. resident of the Board ofEducation and the Minister of Health (CP,-22 (39)).THE MINISTER OP HEALTH said that, quite apartfrom the uses to v/hich these camps would be putfor holiday purposes, he thought the proposal was essential to the success of the evacuation scheme.In addition to the evacuation of children, there wasalso the problem of persons who would arrange theirown evacuation.     Again, the hospital accommodationrequired in emergency could only be provided if alarge number of hutments were set up0.     It was better that the extra accommodation should be used in peacerather than that it should stand idle.     He also .referred to the proposal, which had been approved inconnection with the housing of persons whose houses were destroyed by air bombardment, for a specialCorporation to carry on emergency reconstruction.      the setting up of a central organisation to deal withemergency hutting and the accumulation of material for this purpose would be of great value.      his main conclusions were, first, that some provisionof hutting should be made this year:    secondly thatthe hutments built should be put to a suitable usein peace:    thirdly., that the terms on which thehutting should be provided might be further investi-gated.     He was influenced in this matter by thevast extent of the destruction which would result from air bombardment on the Air Ministry calculations.
1t-.1, SECRETARY OF ST..TE FOR HOME AFFAIRS thoughtthat It would, help the Chancellor of the Exchequerif -Are Exchequer contribution was limited to a capitalcontribution, and that persons who attended campswere asked to pay a charge which covered the wholemaintenance costo     He was satisfied, however, thatthe public were intensely interested in the provisionof camps and would expect developments in tiiife matter to be followed upftTHE PRIME MINISTER thought that there was some danger of considering the use of camps in connectionwith too many purposes,,     For example, the evacuation of children, the accommoclation of persons whose houseshad been destroyed, hospital accommodation in emergency and holiday camps, had all been mentioned?.      Further-,the number of persons who would be accommodated inthese camps was trivial in comparison with theevacuation problem as a wholeo     He thought that the camps problem should, be limited for the time being tobilleting children and perhaps their mothers, and. thatthe possible uses of camps should not be pitched toohighe.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that his interests inthis matter arose from the problem of evacuation.Any contribution to this difficult problem was notto be despised.     He had first taken the line that until he was in a position to formulate his immediatedefence requirements, he was not in a position to dealwith an item Like camps, which &quot;formed part of thelong-term programmes     He hads. however, reached theconclusion that the provision of camps, even if on a somewhat small scale relatively to the whole problem,
would be of great assistance in making the evacuationproblem work smoothly.     The persons on whom the refugees were to he billeted were uneasy at theprospect, and no scheme of evacuation would be completeunless special places were available to which refugees who behaved in an undisciplined, fashion in billetscould be sent.      There was also the argument that, when we were spending so much money on defence purposes itwas attractive to find an item of expenditure whichhad a peace-time use.     He felt sure that if theGovernment threw their mantle over this scheme forcamps, private enterprise would do a great deal more to help.In regard to maintenance, he agreed that it was wrong in principle that the State should bear anycost of the annual maintenance charge of holidaycamps.     In regard to school camps the position wasdifferent, since the State was empowered under theexisting statutory authority not merely to pay 50per cent, of the capital expenditure, but alsoto pay a grant at the rate of 50 per cent, for campsfor secondary schools, and 25 per cent, in the caseof camps for elementary schools.     From one pointof view it could be said that what was now proposedamounted to no more than the Government undertaking,on behalf of the Local Authorities, what the LocalAuthorities already had power to do but had not done.THE PEII/I3 im-TISTEPv was not clear that camps erectedunder the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s proposals would be used as part of regular school arrangements, in the same way as camps erected by Local Authorities under theirexisting statutory powers.
In further discussion, several Ministers expressedthe vie?/ that the details of the scheme might perhaps be further considered.THE SECRETARY OF b&apos;T&apos;,-TE FOR SCOTLAND said that thescheme would be helpful from the Scottish point ofview, particularly in regard to their overcrowdingproblems, if suitable sites could be found in relationto the big Scottish cities.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was ready to seean experiment made in regard to the position of camps.He thought a case could be established lor setting upcamps to supplement the facilities at present availablefor persons evacuated, particularly children^      if arrangements could be made for the camps to be used inpeace-time, that was all to the good.     Further, therewould be some grounds for a subsidy if it could be showthat a camp which was-erected,..for the double purposeof a peace,e.-time camp and a . camp-for war-time refugeeswould cost more than a camp erected as for peace-timepurposes only.      But he felt considerable doubts as toany scheme for subsidising holiday camps.     He was alsoopposed to any attempt to.,.ge.t a specific number,p Lcampbuilt by August, which he thought was likely to resultin waste of money.The Cabinet agreed:-That the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Lord Privy Seal should discuss further the proposals in CP. -22 (39),with, a view to submitting to theCabinet a revised scheme, designed to test the possibilities of camps, and.taking into account the points raised in discussion.
NATIONALSERVICEVOLUNTEERS.Pay fory/hole-time service of,in Time offer.(previous reference:Cabinet 57(33) Con-clusion 12),2. The Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumhy the Lord Privy Seal (C.P.-26 (39)) recalling thaton December 20th last he had stated in the House ofCommons that information would be supplied to intendingvolunteers regarding the terms of their employment incivil defence, whether part-time service or Y/hole-time service, and proposing that he should now beauthorised to announce that the rates of pay atpresent contemplated for whole-time service during warin civil defence were 60/- a week for a man and40/- a week for a woman.THE LORD PRIVY&quot; SEAL said that an announcement on this matter was now overdue and could not be delayed.    The pay of the one important branch of theCivil Defence, namely, the Police War Reserve hadalready been fixed at 60/- a week with a rentalallowance if the man was unable to live at home.This decision involved the grant of the same rate of pay to Auxiliary Firemen employed on a whole-time basis.    It remained to consider the other categories of A.R.P. volunteers who had been employed whole-timein war.    He had at first thought that it would bepossible to fix a slightly lower rate, but he had cometo the conclusion that it was impossible to admit a difference in value, which could be measured at ashilling or two a week, between the various types ofservice to be rendered by whole-time volunteers during a war.    As regards women, the best analogs&apos;- was theV.A.D. and payment of  2 a week was proposed.The Lord Privy Seal added that he had seenrepresentatives of the T.U.C on this matter someten days ago.    Mr. Bevin had protested vigorously at
the proposed rate of 60/-, which he said was notreasonable for men with responsibility.    Nevertheless,the Lord Privy Seal believed that the rate of 60/-would be acquiesced in, particularly if it waspossible to settle terms of compensation for thoseinjured in the course of training in peace time, whichthe T.U.C. would regard as reasonable.The Lord Privy Seal concluded that, in his view on the whole 60/- was not an unreasonable rate forthe type of person he had in mind, and he was quite clear that any lower rate would stand no chance of acceptance.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he agreed with this proposal, but he hoped that the lord privy Seal would announce the 60/- as a flat all-in ratePand would make no reference to the proposed rentalallowance of 6/- a week in certain cases.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that in a suddenemergency, it might be necessary to transfer people to other areas, and that if no arrangements could bemade for accommodation, it would be necessary tomake some Concession by way of rental allowance.But he proposed to make no reference to this matter for the time being.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that the&apos;comparable rate for a man of the lowest rank of the auxiliary Air Force was 58/1, and he thought that thejrate now proposed might cause some difficulties tothe Auxiliary Air Force, particularly if a 6/- rentalallowance was paid on top of the 60/- flat rate inprovincial centres.
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said that,without wishing to take a narrow view of the matter,it was necessary to pay regard to the possible repercussions of this proposal.    He compared therate proposed with the rate payable to a singleprivate in the Territorial Army of 47/3.    In regardto women, the Army had arranged to pay two-thirds ofthe rate payable to single men which would be lessthan the A.R.P. rate.   Men employed in the OrdnanceFactories would receive 42/- to 55/- a week, and inwar time they would be required to stay at their work in the national interest and would not beallowed to take employment as whole-time A.R.P.volunteers.    In time of war, the whole nation wouldbe called upon to do its duty and he thought thatany suspicion that certain classes were receiving a higher rate of pay would give rise to bad feeling.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the fact thatthe emoluments of the members of the Auxiliary forces were assessed on an entirely different basis and included the provision of. many items in kind prevented the comparison from being as direct as had beensuggested. &apos;(The Prime Minister at this point left theMeeting and the Chancellor, of the Exchequertook the Chair. )The A.R.P. volunteers would include persons of all classes and it was not possible to find any direct industrial equivalent.    The employees oflocal authorities were the nearest equivalent, andon that basis the rate of 60/- was not extravagant.Rightly or wrongly, comparison would be made, notwith the Territorial Army, but with local authorityemployment.
THE MINISTER OP LABOUR said that the rates ofLocal Government Servants had been fixed as the resultof a number of delicate negotiations on joint industrial Councils, and he was satisfied that therate now proposed was not unreasonable.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE said thatit was distasteful to contemplate the fact that theoutbreak of war would mean for a certain number of people a considerable increase in remuneration,notwithstanding the sacrifices which others would becalled upon to face.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that hewould like to suggest that the rate paid should bebased on the rate of the Territorial Force, namely47/1 for a single man and 58/1 for a married man with one child. If this did not produce a sufficientvolume of recruits, the whole question of NationalService would have to be examined again.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL   repeated that he had hoped to be able to accept the rate of 57/6, but he was satisfied that such a proposal would only involveserioufe trouble with organised labour.In reply to THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY of lancaster, THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the rateproposed for women A.R.P. whole-time volunteers didnot affect the Women&apos;s Land Army, and that this point would be made clear in any statement which was issued.After further discussion, in the course of whichthe Secretaries of State for War and Air expressed the fear that the adoption of the rates now proposedmight result in their having to ask for increases inthe Auxiliary Forces, the Cabinet agreed:
(1)    That the Lord Privy Seal should have authority to make a general announcement that the rates of pay contemplated forwhole-time service during war in civil defence were 60/- a week for a man and40/- a week for a woman:(S)   That it would he made clear that thiswas the Government&apos;s present intentionwhich must he subject to any laterdecisions of the Government of the day when the occasion of the whole-time service arises:(3)    That no reference should he made in theproposed announcement to the proposalto pay rental allowance in circumstances where a man with dependants in one ofthe civil defence services is calledupon to serve away from home.

interfere with building society practice.      This.view was shared by the representatives of the associations for Building Societies who had been consulted.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR agreed withthe course proposed.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said that,if legislation on this matter was no longer a matterof urgency, he hoped that the claim of the Bill to a place in a very crowded programme would be considered on its merits, in relation to other urgent legislation.THE LORD CHANCELLOR thought that, in orderto avoid serious disturbance in the Building Industry,it might be desirable that the Bill should be presented, even if it could not be passed intolegislation in the current session.The Cabinet agreed:-(l) In the event of the Judgment delivered in the Borders case not being such asseriously to interfere with building society practice, to give authority forthe presentation of the Building SocietiesBill if this course is thought desirable,without further reference to the Cabinet.(2) That,-.in view of the difficulty, of findingtime for-this Bill, in the House -of Commonsowing to the congested state of business in that House, consideration should begiven to the desirability of introducing.    the Bill in the House of Lordso

The Cabinet had under consideration aMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland(H.A.-4 (39)) covering the draft Deer, and Ground Game(Scotland) Bill, the principal object of which was tomake provision as regards Scotland for the preventionof damage to crops by deer or rabbits:     together withthe following recommendation to the Cabinet thereon by the Committee of Home Affairs (H.A.C&amp;2nd Conclusions,Minute 4):-&quot;To authorise the introduction forthwith inthe House of Lords of the Deer and GroundGame (Scotland) Bill in the form of thedraft annexed to H.A.-4 (39), subject toany drafting or other minor alterations that may be found necessary or desirable.&quot;The Cabinet approved the above recommendationof the Home Affairs Committee.
A or o10 OF LIBELBILL.(previous reference iCabinet 60(38), Con-cluaion SO).6, THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that as indicatedin the conclusion noted in the margin he had consulted a number of eminent lawyers on this matter.They were all of the opinion that the Bill was avery bad Bill indeed.      There was nothing right about it although there were a few proposals that went inthe right direction.      The object of the Bill wasto protect the newspapers from having to paysubstantial damages in libel actions.. - At the same time,  it was generally agreed,among lawyers that the Lav/ of Libel was in an unsatisfactory state and that its reform should be tackled.      He would, therefore, like authority toappoint a Committee to consider the matter.      Hethought that owing to the technical nature of thesubject, the Committee should consist largely oflawyers.Discussion then turned to the attitude to beadopted by the Government to this Bill on Fridaythe 3rd February.      It was thought that the bill which was first business on Friday (the CharitableCollections (Regulations) Bill) might be disposedof early.      It was clear that there would be plenty of opposition to the Lav/ of Libel Amendments Billbut the closure might be applied.In discussion the view was expressed that,while the Cabinet would do well to set up a Committeeto consider this matter, the membership should notbe restricted to members of the legal profession.It was also suggested that it might be desirable to
approach the proposer of the Bill and indicate thelines that the Government proposed to adopt.The Cabinet agreed -that the Government spokesman should indicate that theGovernment felt obliged to oppose the Bill, as they did not regard it as dealing with the subjectsatisfactorily.     At the same time they recognised that the subject was one which was in need of substantial reform and they proposedto appoint a strong Gommittee toreport on the subject.
