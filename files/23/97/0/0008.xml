rpHfj] CABINET.: NEXT 1.    THE PRIME MINISTER reminded hisMEETING-      &quot;colleagues that the next weekly Meeting of the&quot;Cabinet would be held on Thursday, 2nd March,as he was to be in attendance on the Kingat the Birmingham section of the BritishIndustries Pair on Wednesday, 1st March.
hlwbbrRation.4iywo&apos;andIrraany.previouspabirtet 7039), Con-Illusion 1.)fcabinet6 (39),iconclusionI).said that his colleagues would have seen some recent telegrams reporting interviews between the Earl ofPerth and Count Ciano in regard to articles in theItalian Press, hostile both to this country and toFrance and particularly to the latter (telegrams nos.  Ill and 112 from Home).1% iyc])&apos;2- - The Foreign Secretary said that a telegram hadbeen despatched to the Earl of Perth on the previous evening urging him, if he had another opportunity todiscuss the matter with Count Ciano, to deal with it somewhat more emphatically.     He thought that italy was behaving in a dangerous manner vis-a-vis France.The Secretary of State referred to the questionof military activities on the Brenner, to whichallusion had been made at the Meeting of the cabinet referred to in the margin.     He said that a reply had now been received from our Ambassador at Rome(telegram No. 105) reporting that enquiries by HisMajesty&apos;s Consul at Milan had not so far elicited any information as to movements of German war materialor troops into Italy.     The telegram added that in local military circles there was growing oppositionto the Government&apos;s policy, which was held to involverisk of war.F.R.CJ (j-q)^.      The Foreign Secretary then referred to a telegram which had been received the previous day from our ambassador at Washington (telegram No. 76).     this telegram reported a conversation which our ambassador had had on the 20th February with the Under-Secretaryof State at Washington, who had received, from theFrench General Staff,  information of a somewhatdisquieting nature as to German and Italian militaryactivities.     The Secretary of State read out this telegram and said that, he thought that the information
(m Ij dsupply ofinformation todominionBvernments,Jp re s ent at ioni Italy on Suezal Board.reviouseierence:cabinet 60 (58)conclusion 4*)contained in it was probably somewhat distorted,but that he would make such enquiries as were possible.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE thenreferred to a telegram (ITo.  115) which had beenreceived from the Earl of Perth on the previous evening reporting information received from theUnited States Ambassador at Rome regarding a conversation  whichSignor Landini, the ItalianPress Attache in Paris had recently had withSignor Mussolini.     Signor Landini had said that italian desiderata were -(1) representation on the Suez Canal Boardand reduction of Canal dues,(2) a free port at Jibuti and arrangementsfor use of the railway, and(3) an arrangement for the Italian Colony inTunis whereby they should be placedon the same footing as Frenchsubjects.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that asuggestion had been made to him on a previous occasion by the French Air Minister that it mightbe desirable that this country and France should give information to the United States on similar lines.In discussion it was agreed that it was desirable that the Dominions should be kept informed of developments by means of periodic resumestelegraphed to them every three or four days,but that care should be taken not to incorporateinto such messages any unsubstantiated rumours.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he appreciated that under the present constitutionof the Suez Canal Board it would be impossibleto agree to an Italian becoming a member of theBoard without the serious disadvantage that he
would thereby get information&apos;on secret defence matters.     He thought, however, that it shouldbe possible to alter the constitution so as topermit of an Italian becoming a member of the Boardwithout his being made aware of defence matters.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said he thought that there was a further objection,that at the present moment an Italian national couldnot become a member of the Canal Board unless he waselected by the French shareholders, and lie thoughtthat great pressure would be required to bring this about-.The Cabinet took note of the above statements in regard to Italy and the Suez Canal Board, and agreed:(l) That the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs should arrange that theDominion Governments should be kept informed of developments in regard tothe international situation by meansof periodic resumes telegraphed to themevery three or four days, but that care should be taken not to incorporateinto such messages any unsubstantiatedrumours.(2) To invite the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to arrange for examination of the Lord Chancellorssuggestion in regard to the possibilityof revising the constitution of theBoard of the 3xiez Canal Company - so asto enable an Italian national tobecome a member of the Board, but without giving him access to information on defence matters.
hJ d OognitionGeneralanoorsrnroent.previous conference;bluet. 7.(99)3.      THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs reminded his colleagues of the conclusions reached at last week&apos;s Meeting of the Cabinet on thequestion of recognition of General Franco?s Governmentin Spain.     A telegram had been despatched to Burgosto give effect to these decisions, indicating that,while we did not wish to impose conditions, it.wouldbe helpful if General Franco was prepared to givecertain undertakings.     No direct answer had beenreceived to this telegram.     On Thursday eveninglast he had seen the Spanish Ambassador, who had informed him that the Spanish Government had decidedthat they would be prepared to cease hostilities if general Franco would give an assurance on thequestion of reprisals, and that they would not insist upon an assurance on the other two points previouslymentioned.     We had offered assistance in negotiations on this basis, and a draft telegram which had beenprepared with this end in view had been shown to theSpanish Ambassador.     The latter had, however, askedfor time to consider the matter;    the next news hadbeen that he had gone over to Paris and two or three days had elapsed during which it had been impossible tosecure any definite answer from any of the parties tothe negotiations.Continuing, the Foreign Secretary said thathe had met the Spanish Ambassador on Monday evening and that they had agreed that, as he could not assureus that the action which we proposed to take wouldhave the support of his Government, the best coursewould be that we should act on our own initiative.
On the Tuesday afternoon telegram No. 88 hadbeen received from Sir Robert Hodgson.     The text of this telegram was corrupt, and it was not clear whether the message contained in the telegram was an answer to the enquiries made by us or whether it represented the text of a public announcement.     The Foreign Secretary thought,however, that this message was, in part at least,attributable to the representations which we and theFrench Government had made.     Although its substance wasnat altogether satisfactory, he thought that the right course was to accept the message as the best assurance that we were likely to receive, and to recognise general franco without further delay.     Accordingly a telegram had been despatched to our Ambassador at Paris (telegramNo. 61) indicating that we wished to announce ourrecognition of General Franco at the earliest possible moment, and in any case not later than the 24th February,and that we hoped the French would agree to this course and would make a simultaneous announcement.     In effect this telegram Invited the French Government to reach adecision as quickly as possible, but did not imply thatwe would take action without consulting them.The Foreign Secretary added that no recent information had been received as the result of M. Berard*mission to Burgos.After a short discussion the Cabinet agreed:To authorise the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to accord recognition toGeneral Franco&apos;s Government, and, in so doing, to follow the procedure suggestedby him and summarised above.(See also Conclusion 4 below.)
o &apos;vthe margin, the Cabinet had before them a MemorandumFinancialAssistance by the Chancellor of the exchequer (C.P. 47 (39))to.outlining a scheme, prepared by the Treasury in con-previous reference: sultation with certain British Banks and the adviserCabinet 7(39), Con- to the Chinese Government, with the object of maintainingelusion 5).so far as possible, stability in the sterling value ofthe Chinese dollar, by means of an Exchange StabilisationFund.    Notwithstanding the considerable risk involvedin any such scheme, it might well be argued that itwould be better to start the Fund at a figure of,say,  10 millions (instead of the  6 millions previously proposed), of which the Chinese Banks   would contribute 5 millions and we should contribute a like amount.    TheChancellor asked authority to settle within a total of 5 millions.    The Fund would be managed by a Committee,of which particulars were given&apos;, and the intention wasthat the Fund should be wound up after the close ofhostilities.    The transaction would take the form of abanking operation and not a direct loan to the ChineseGovernment.    This procedure would therefore be lessprovocative to Japan.    Legislation would, however, berequired, and the Chancellor proposed that it shouldtake the form of the Treasury being authorised to give guarantees to British Banks in respect of operations to maintain the stability of Chinese currency, providedthat the amount of the loss to be made good should notexceed  3 (or  5) millions.As regards conditions attaching to the loan,the Chancellor made the following recommendations(a) the offer should not be made conditional on the Chinese Government resuming theirobligation to meet the full service ofChina&apos;s foreign loans.    The ChineseGovernment had just given notice of their inability to do this on the ground that theJapanese now occupied ports which producedsome 70 per cent, of China&apos;s total revenue,-7-
&amp;j J u(b) it was considered desirable, however, toobtain from the Chinese Government some reasonable offer, and, if possible, to getthe representatives of the bondholders torecommend that offer as acceptable.(c) the contemplated support should not be conditional on the implementation of theCustoms arrangements negotiated with theJapanese Government last May, though itwas felt at the same time that everyeffort should be made to secure that appropriate quotas towards the service ofthe foreign loans should be allocated fromthe Customs revenues collected in the areasunder Japanese control.    The ChineseGovernment, however, would not be held responsible for the transfer of thesequotas into foreign currency.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER,  in outlining the main points of his Memorandum,  explained that therewere three points still unsettled.    Pirst, that his advisers   were not yet satisfied whether the total ofthe fund should be fixed at  6 millions or  10 millions.The Chancellor asked for authority to settle thismatter in the light of the further advice which hewould receive.    Secondly, he attached importance to the chartered Bank and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banktaking some share in the risk.    He was pressing themfurther on this matter, but he asked for authority toallow the scheme to proceed,  if need be, even if neither of these two Banks would be willing to take any share in the risk.    The third point concerned the service ofChina&apos;s foreign loans secured on the customs.    He thoughtthat an endeavour should be made to secure some arrange-ment by which the Chinese Government would undertaketo pay a proportion of their obligations on their foreign loans, corresponding to the proportion of herformer revenue which China still received now that theJapanese were in occupation of her ports.    There was,of course, the likelihood that complaints would be made
o a oW (J &apos;Jif the Exchequer guaranteed a loan to support theChinese currency, at a time when China was ceasing topay interest on her foreign loans, which were largelyheld in this country.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that one answer to any such complaint would he that we had a direct interest in the Chinese currency, as the result of ourChina trade, and that this interest was independent of China&apos;s foreign loans.    He enquired whether theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Foreign secretary thought that we should now take action on the lines proposed, without any further parallel action on thepart of the United States.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that the view taken toy the United States Governmentwas that, if we guaranteed a loan of  3 millions,we should then    have done atoout as much as the UnitedStates had done for China, whereas if we guaranteed a loan for  5 millions we should have done rather more.He had asked the United States Ambassador1s opinion onthis matter and the latter had said that public upinionin the United States would be shocked if they knew how much the United States Government had done for China.The Foreign Secretary thought that the United states would be prepared to make public some, but not all, ofthe help which they had afforded to China.    He also thought that the decision to act on the lines proposed would be of considerable value from the point of viewof public opinion in the United States, and also in japan.    In the latter case it would be linked with theJapanese occupation of Hainan.
THE PRIME MINISTER hoped that the cabinet would give the authority asked for.    At one time he had felt considerable doubt about this proposal, but hewas now satisfied that it could be adopted without anyfear of provoking retaliation from Japan, and that itwould have salutary effects in that country.Discussion ensued as to when an announcement should be made.    THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER thoughtthat the outstanding questions could be settled withina few days.The view was generally expressed that it wouldbe desirable to make an announcement within, say, thenext week.    It was agreed that it would be desirable,if possible, that an announcement on this matter, andour recognition of General Franco&apos;s Government, shouldbe made on the same day.The Cabinet agreed:-(l) To approve the proposals set out bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer inhis Memorandum (CP.  47 (39)), and toauthorise the Chancellor to reach asettlement -as regards the outstanding points involved, viz.  -(a) whether the amount to be guaranteedshould be  3 millions or  5 millions;(b) whether the Hong Kong and ShanghaiBank and the Chartered Bank shouldbe required to cover some part ofthe risk;(c) whether an undertaking should beobtained from the Chinese Governmentin regard to the payment of a proportion of the service of China&apos;s foreign loans,(2) To authorise the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to make the arrangements in regard to an early announcement ofthe decision reached on this matter,bearing in mind that, if possible, anannouncement should be made on the same date as the announcement of recognition by His Majesty&apos;s Government of general franco&apos;s Government.
u u 4-*****Londoneviouspference:cabinet 7-9), oon-u&amp;ion 9),5. THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES said that-fee*^had had a difficult week.    Considerable discussion hadtaken place as regards the McMahon-Hussein correspondence.A Committee had been appointed to consider this correspondence, and he was most grateful to the LordChancellor for undertaking the Chairmansip.    He feared,however, that the probable upshot would be that theCommittee would report that, after investigating thematter, they were unable to reach agreement.THE LORD CHANCELLOR explained some of thedifficulties in dealing with the English   texts   whichhad been badly translated into Arabic, and in regard towhich there was sometimes more than one Arabictranslation.   He hoped, however, that we should be ableto persuade the Arabs that we had acted honestly.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES thenexplained the course of the discussions with theJewish representatives, who had shown themselves willingto make quite considerable concessions.   With regardto immigration, they were ready to make considerableconcessions   during the next ten years,provided the position thereafter was left open.He had pressed them to accept plan B, under whichimmigration after ten years could only be agreed to the Arabs consented, but the Jewish representatives had made it clear that they would neither accept noracquiesce in a settlement on these lines.As regards the land question and constitutional questions, discussions had been quite general.
rji r\ qid U (jtdifficult.   As he had informed his colleagues at theprevious meeting, he had initiated private discussions with the representatives of the Neighbouring arab countries, and he had informed his colleagues thatAli Maher had said that he thought the proposalsrepresented the basis of an agreement, with slightmodifications, but that he (the Colonial Secretary)thought that    this was much too optimistic.(1)    Recognition of an independent Arafo State.(2)    Complete stoppage of immigration.(3)    Complete stoppage of land sales to Jews.It was clear that far more insistence was placedon the first than on the second and third claims.Our information had been that the representativesof the Palestinian Arabs had not originally intendedto insist on the first claim, but were really more interested in the second and third.    There was reasonto think, however, that they had been encouraged byNuri Pasha in particular to adhere to the first claim,and that Ali Maher had supported them in this attitude.recognition of an independent Araih State, it was clear that none of the neighbouring Arab States was anxious to see Great Britain leave Palestine - at anyrate within the next fifteen or twenty years.OjTVYlC*These claims fell under three heads:-Although there was
they  were more concerned with the form than with the substance of independence.    It had&quot;been suggested by the Arab representatives that a solution could be reached on the linesof the regime which had been in force forsome years in Iraq., while arrangements fora constitutional Assembly were being worked out.   A provisional Government of IraqiMinisters had been established, with BritishAdvisers;    during this period, which lastedsome four years, the Iraqi Ministers had beena facade, and the British Advisers had beenthe real rulers of the country.   Nuri Pashawas urging us to follow this precedent.    Onegreat difficulty in finding a solution onthese lines was of course that the populationof Palestine was not confined to Arabs.Nevertheless, if some means could be found of meeting this claim for recognition of anindependent State, he thought that the palestinian Arabs might be willing to make some concession on immigration based on theirsympathy for the plight of the jewish refugees.
Continuing, the Secretary of State forthe Colonies said that he realised that considerablerisks were inherent in this proposal, and thatwe must not allow ourselves to be landed in recognition of an independent Arab State.     Hehad, however, promised to consider these proposalscarefully, and a good deal of work was being done in investigating them,,The Secretary of State informed theCabinet that he had spent much time in trying to persuade the representatives of the Jews and ofthe three neighbouring Arab States to meet at around table conference..     He had arranged for this conference to take place on the ensuing day.      TheJews had then been guilty of an act- of greatstupidity:  they had sent a letter to the Press (whichwas published in .that morning&apos;s &apos;Times&apos;    annw.no fl.iir*&apos;to discuss matters with, the Arabs^ Paud Bey had said ttiatin view of this letter he thought it was impossiblefor the Arabs to come to the proposed conference,and had asked that it should be deferred.     Buthe still hoped that he would be able to get the round table discussion started, notwithstandingthis set-back.THE SECRETARY   OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he had not been able to attend theConference frequently, but, vi/he never he did, he found the Secretary of State for the Coloniesimperturbable in the midst of a babel of confusion.&amp; sayirg that they had always been prepared
He had seen a good deal of the Arabrepresentatives, and he was satisfed that much would depend on whether we could meet the Arabdemand for independent status without givingaway more than we could safely do, and providedthat a position analogous to that which Iraq had occupied could be substituted for the Mandate.The representatives of the Arabs were readyto agree that we should have the right toveto legislation which would be prejudicial tothe JewsoTHE SECRETARY OF STATE .PORTHE colonies said that it was clear that the demand centredmainly on the form rather than the substance of independenceo      In reply to the LordChancellor, he agreed that what was asked forwas recognition of an independent PalestineState, rather than of an independent arab state,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR HOME affairs said that he thought that the Iraq precedentindicated a number of dangers which should be avoided.     His recollection was that Nuri Pashahad made much the same sort of representationswhen claiming   independent status   for Iraq, butthat this had not prevented Iraq from adopting a very difficult attitude as soon as the treaty had been signed.The Cabinet took note of this statement and agreed to awaitfurther developments,,
*s ft f*d u UTHE ARMY. 6.      The Cabinet had under consideration aMemorandum by the Prime Minister (CP. 49 (39) on theState ofPreparedness State of Preparedness of the Army in relation to itsin relationto its Role.  Role,  in which he informed his.colleagues that, in(Previous       accordance with the Conclusion referred to in the reference:Cabinet 5     margin, two meetings had been held, attended by(39), Con-elusion 3.) himself, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence, the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster and the Secretary of State for War,at which the proposals of the latter (CP.  27 (39))and of the Chiefs of Staff (CP.  28 (39)) had beendiscussed.    The Conclusions reached at these meetingsmay briefly be summarised as follows:-FIRST (REGULAR) CONTINGENT - ITEMS; (l)  - (3).Item (l) - The Mobile Division to be organisedinto 2 smaller Divisions, at an estimated cost of  5 millions.RECOMMENDATION:    Acceptance, of this proposal.Item (2) - First two Regular Divisions to beprovided with full Equipment and reserves at an estimated cost of 15 millions.Item (3) - Second two Regular Divisions to be equipped as in (2), at an estimatedcost of  11 millions.RECOMMENDATION:    That all four RegularDivisions should be provided withEquipment and Reserves on the scaleestimated to be required for continental warfare.With regard to the question of the period between mobilisation and the dates when the first and second echelons of the First (Regular) Contingent shouldbe ready to embark, the Chiefs of Staff were examiningwhether the despatch of the first echelon could be expedited.    In view of the forthcoming Staff Con-versations with the French, however, the Prime Ministerand his colleagues felt that it would be unwise to reach
O fi f*J6 c! tsecond echelons should he despatched overseas.RECOMMENDATION:     That for the present theSecretary of State for War should he authorised to proceed on the basis thatthe first echelon would be ready to embarkin 21 days, and the second echelon in 60days after mobilisation.    This meantacceptance of item (2) as it stood(estimated cost  13 millions) and ofitem (3) at a reduced cost of  9,600,000.Item (4) - Formation of two &quot;Colonial&quot; Divisionsout of existing non-field force units and provision for these two divisions of Equipment and Reserves on a ColonialScale.    Estimated cost  11 millions.RECOMMENDATION;    That this question should be deferred until a decision had been reached on the Report of the Expert Committee onthe Defence of India.Item (5)(a) -JProvision of War Equipment and reserves for four Territorial infantry divisions at an estimated cost of 50 millions.RECOMMENDATION:   Acceptance of the proposal,subject to the modification that inthe forthcoming Staff Conversationsour representatives should proceed onthe assumption that these fourTerritorial Divisions should be fully equipped and ready to embark 6 months,instead of 4 months, after the outbreakof war.    This would reduce the cost bysome  3 to  4 millions.    particular importance was attached to early stepsbeing taken to create the war potentialrequired to maintain these four divisions in the field.Finally, the Memorandum stated that thefigures given were approximate only and were subjectto financial review; also, that the recommendations contained therein were subject to detailed examinationbetween the War Office   and the Treasury of theexpenditure necessary to carry out the Secretaryof State for War&apos;s proposals.
THE PRIME MINISTER said that the proposalset out in the Memorandum represented a seriousaddition to our liabilities.      He would like to explain the reasons why he felt that there was no alternative to the course proposed.Item (1)  (the Mobile Division) was a technicalmatter.     The technical experts attached considerable importance to the change proposed which would add &quot;materially to the effectiveness of the mobile force.He did not think that this proposal could be refused.Item (S) raised two points.      The first was thatfor the present these two regular divisions were equipped for defensive warfare only0     This was part of the conception of an army available for service in anypart of the world, but not specially equipped for continental warfare.     Hitherto the Cabinet had notbeen asked to agree to any commitment that these tv/odivisions would be sent to the Continent.     Thesituation, however, had been changed by the events ofthe previous Autumn, and Prance now had to face thepossibility of meeting a far stronger German force.There was also a feeling in Prance that we should notbe playing an adequate part unless we made some con-tribution on land.It was therefore necessary to depart from the conception of an army available for service anywhere,and to envisage one army equipped for service on theContinent and a second army equipped for service in theColonies or elsewhere overseas.     Not only did thisinvolve a higher scale of equipment and reserves for theforces to be despatched to the Continent, but ?/e must also take steps to ensure that the first echelon couldbe despatched as quickly as possible.     The PrimeMinister added that while he had. come to this conclusionwith some reluctance, he saw no alternative.- 18 -   -
As regards item (3) (the second echelon of theregular field army), hitherto there had been no commit-ment to send these divisions to France.     It was now pro-posed that we should enter into such a commitment.     it followed that these two divisions also must be properlyequipped for that purpose.     There remained, however, thepossibility of effecting some reduction in the reserves which must be accumulated in peace-time.    The Prime minister  explained that the extent of these reserves depended onthe period which would elapse before these divisions were engaged in hostilities;    the longer this period, the morestores could be accumulated by the factories after theoutbreak of v/ar.     The saving proposed ( 1,400,000) wasnot large, but we could not afford to add any unnecessaryitem of expenditure.     At the same time if, as a result ofthe Staff Conversations, it should appear that there were strong reasons for sending the second, two divisions in 40instead of 60 days, this matter might have to be recon-sidered, and the element   of expense involved would not,in his view, turn the scale.Reverting to item (S), the present proposal was that   .the first two divisions should be ready to embark threeweeks after mobilisation, but considerable time would be occupied in embarkation and trans-shipment.     The amountof time involved was so considerable that he had asked for it to be further investigated by the Chiefs of Staff.     TheCabinet might have to consider further proposals designedto accelerate the despatch and trans-shipment of the firstechelon.Turning to item (5), the Prime Minister explained the present composition of the Territorial Army, v/hichcomprised 5 Anti-aircraft divisions, 9 infantry divisions,3 mobile divisions and various miscellaneous units
ei Jl Uwhich could be grouped into a further division.Unless the proposals in the present paper were accepted,it v/ould be impossible for any of these divisions(other than the anti-aircraft divisions)  to engage in hostilities until a year after the outbreak of war.While he did not ask the Cabinet to reach a decision that the Territorial Army should go overseas on theoutbreak of war, he thought that we should be in aposition to send some part of the Territorial Armyoverseas in less than a year if we so desired.      liethought that public opinion would become restive if thepresent position became widely known.     He was satisfiedthat we must be in a position in which we could exerciseour discretion and send part of the Territorial Armyoverseas in less than a year after the outbreak of warif we so desired.     The suggestion in this paper v/ouldenable us to send four divisions overseas after sixmonths.     He emphasised that while it v/as proposed toenter into a definite commitment as regards the fourregular divisions and   the   mobile divisions, the rev/ould be no such commitment in regard to the TerritorialArmy.     Finally,  the Prime Minister said he thought itv/as not advisable that any final decision should bereached until the Staff Conversations with the French and perhaps the Belgians had taken place.     He thought thatfor the purpose of these conversations it v/as desirableto have some provisional plan on v/hich to v/ork and he proposed that our representatives should enter on dis-cussions on the basis indicated.     If however theFrench representatives pressed strongly for some alteration in this provisional plan, the matter couldof course be reconsidered.
As regards the Colonial Divisions, the PrimeMinister explained that he thought that a decision shouldhe deferred.      It seemed likely that some further unitsmight become available from India.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said that he was most grateful to the Prime Minister for the interest which he had shown in this matter, and to the Chancellorof the Exchequer for the attitude which he had adopted.Subject to a decision as to the proposed Colonial Divisions,the proposals set out in the Prime minister&apos;s memorandum would give the War Office what they required.      He agreed,however, that the dates at which the first and secondechelons of the Field Force should be ready to embark might require further examination.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE saidthat the position had greatly changed in the last sixmonths.     The present proposals represented a considerable advance on the previous conception, and would make the role of the Army far more definite.     He thought that theproposals represented a good basis for discussion with theFrench of our combined war plans.     The question of accelerating the date of despatch of the Field Force to theContinent was under consideration by the Chiefs of Staff. yTheir Report was not yet available, but he understood thatthey were likely to report that, short of some tk a;) or action,such as building special ships - a course which would taketwo years - the most that could be done would be to accelerate the despatch of the first echelon by some two or three dayssTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, while he was gravely disturbed at the financial aspect of theseproposals, other aspects of this matter outweighed finance,and he felt that he had no alternative but to agree with theproposals in the Memorandum.     At the same time he felt bound
to make two points;    first, that he hoped that theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence and the Secretaryof State for War would do all they could to ensure thatthe expenditure was kept within the estimates of cost:second, that, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, he acceptedthese proposals on the understanding that they werebalanced proposals and represented a complete scheme, andthat it would not be necessary to add a number ofsupplementary and costly further items, in order to render the force effective.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidatione.that he was concerned that no definite reply had beenreceived from the French Government in regard to theproposed Staff Conversations.     He hoped that the french were not occupying time in working out a number of suggestions that would prove inconvenient to us, such as,for example, conscription.     A telegram had been dispatched to Paris the previous night to say that wewere ready for the Staff Conversations to start.In regard to the dates of embarkation, theSecretary of State added that he was glad to note thatthis matter might be re-considered, as his own feeling was that whatever help we sent would be required quickly.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS,referring to the discussion in the Cabinet a fortnightago, enquired what was the position in regard to thesecond part of the scheme for the extension of the air defence of Great Britain, to which he attached even greater importance than to the present proposals.     He assumed that acceptance of the present proposals would not prejudiceconsideration of this scheme for the further expansionof A.D.G.B.

THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINaTION OF DEFENCEexplained that this scheme was under further examination by the Home Defence Committee.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thoughtacceptance of the present proposals would not prejudicefurther consideration of the scheme referred to.THE SECRETARY OP ST^TE FOR WAR said that up tothis year there had been no Parliamentary pressure inregard to the Field Force, but pressure was now becomingevident.     It was argued that our solidarity with Pranceinvolved the growing importance of assistance on land.He thought that the present proposals were justified on two main grounds:    first, the troops to be sent to theContinent must be properly equipped;    second, in regard tothe Territorial Army the arrangements proposed wouldenable us to tide over the period of the first year, duringwhich we should otherwise be unable to send any Territorialtroops overseas.     The present proposals would enable usto maintain a flow of troops overseas from the beginningof the war to the end.     He explained that he did not propose to earmark any particular Territorial Divisions asthe four Divisions which would be the first to be despatchedoverseas.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH referred to the number of developments in regard to Civil Defence which were likelyto involve considerable increased expenditure, and saidthat&apos; he was disposed to share the views expressed by theHome Secretary as to the vital importance of measuresconcerning Home Defence.The Cabinet agreed:(l)   To approve the proposals set out in thePrime Minister&apos;s Memorandum (CP. 49 (39))as summarised above.(2)    That in the forthcoming Staff conversations with the French, our representatives should proceed on the basis that the- 23 -
first and second echelons of theField Force would be ready to embarkin 21 and 60 days,respectively, aftermobilisation;   but that no commitment should be entered into asregards the Territorial contingent.
9 4ftp 2.tion ofime ofiousrence:net 7 (37)conclusion 5.)7.      The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (CP. 43(39))furnished in accordance with Conclusion   10 (b) of .the 344th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence,on the subject of the location of GovernmentDepartments in time of war.     In this Memorandumattention was drawn to the assumptions on which theFirst Interim Report (C.I.D. Paper No. 304-A) of there-constituted Sub-Committee on the Evacuation ofGovernment Departments in the Event of War was framed,and Cabinet direction was sought regarding the basis on which the Sub-Committee should continue its work*After describing the short and long-term planscontained in the Sub-Committee1 s Report, which hadbeen prepared in the light of experiences during 1938,the Minister summarised as follows the questions onwhich he desired guidance before the details of the short and long-term plans could be finally Settled;-Short-term plan.(a) Can it be assumed that at the outbreak ofwar Govez&apos;nment Departments will remain inthe central area?(b) Is it agreed that if it becomes necessaryto move the Government machine as a wholefrom Central London, the move should be&apos;direct to the provinces and not to thenorth-west suburbs?LonA-term -plan.(a) Can it be assumed that the De departments andHeadquarter   Branches remaining in London inpeace-time will remain in the central area on the outbreak of hostilities, and, if so,in the event of the Government machine having to leave London, will they move, direct tothe provinces?(b) If?&apos; it agreed that all Government departments and branches of Departments not reallyrequired in London should be located inpeace-time in the provinces as soon aspracticable?(c) Should provision be made for deep Jbomb-proofshelters in the central area for the five
War Rooms of the Cabinet, service departments and Home Security   Organ-isation as a minimum, any extensiondepending on further investigationas to cost, practicability and needin the light of the general government policy in this matter,,THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCEoutlined the main points in his Memorandum.   Hethought that in it there was no alternative to aceptance of the short-term plan.   As regards thelong-term plan this was really based on the same principle, the chief difference was that steps should be taken to remove all except absolutely essential staffs from London.    This involved thereversal of a previous Cabinet decision.    The process;of removal of non-essential staffs from London would of course take a considerable time.In the discussion which ensued THE SECRETARY OFSTATE FOR AIR said that the Air Staff could not   con-template the continued functioning in &quot;Whitehall of theessential staffs of Government offices after theoutbreak of an emergency with any degree of confidence.While he did not wish to raise the point again, hereminded his colleagues that   a   proposal had beensubmitted to locate the headquarters of the AirMinistry in peace-time outside London, but that thisproposal had not been accepted.    He thought that itwas essential that the preparation of accommodation,in the provinces, and in particular the instalment ofthe necessary communications, should proceed as rapidly as possible, in order to make it possible for essential Government Departments to move quickly tothe provinces.
THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY emphasised theimportance of moving non-essential staffs from Whitehallas early as possible.    In further discussion it was explained that the Governors of certain schools in the West of England had been informed that theirpremises would be occupied by Government departments on the outbreak of war.    They were somewhat concerned,and it seemed likely that this would lead to adisclosure in peace-time of the Governments intentions in this matter.    The view was expressed that it was undesirable to allow it to become known that GovernmentDepartments were likely to move to specified localitieson, or soon after the outbreak, of war.    On the otherhand, once the move of non-essential staffs under thelong-term plan was started,  the general principle onwhich we intended to act would inevitably be disclosed.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH raised the question ofnew Departments to be set up on the outbreak of war,and suggested that it might be convenient that suchDepartments should be mobilised in the north-westernsuburbs instead of in the Whitehall area.THE CABINET agreed to accept the short-term plan suggested, subject to further consideration of thepoint raised by the Minister of Health.(At this point the Prime Minister left the Meeting, and the Chancellor of theExchequer took the Chair.)As regards the long-term plan, the MINISTERFOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE said that he asked t atDepartments would apply the scheme of decentralisationfrom London as drastically as possible.

THE MINISTER OP TRANSPORT said that he thought there were a number of questions still to be settledas to the choice of the Departments to be located inparticular areas.    This matter must be considered in .relation to the need for contact between theDepartments concerned.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that while itwould be possible for him to effect a considerableidegree of decentralisation from London in war, underthe Defence of the Realm Regulations, he thought thatdecentralisation in time of peace would be a lengthyand expensive process unless powers were given to requisition premises.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER explained thatthe Rae Committee were in fact continuing to make arrangements on the lines recommended in their report,and that the reason for this submission to the cabinet was that the Committee felt that the general lines on which they were proceeding should receive theapproval of Ministers.Discussion then turned as to the provisionof deep bomb-proof shelters in the central area for five War Rooms.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that the provision for deep bomb-proof accommoda-tion to enable essential Foreign Office activities tocontinue should be investigated.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR asked that consideration should be given, as rapidly as possible,to the provision of buried communications, and to thecost, practicability and need for an extension of thebomb-proof accommodation to provide for activities otherthan those carried out in the War Rooms.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought that thismatter must be considered in relation to thegeneral   problem of   deep   shelters.- 28 -
This was a very difficult matter;    hut he thought thatthe present proposals could be justified provided that theywere justified on the grounds providing protection toenable essential work to continue and not in order toprotect essential workers.     If once it was admitted thatdeep bomb-proof accommodation should be provided for theprotection of any class of essential workers, he thoughtthat it would be very difficult to draw any distinctionbetween the workers for whom such protection might beprovided.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCE saidthat he thought that nothing would be more likelg: to damage the morale of the people of this country than theknowledge that the essential staffs on which our whole scheme depended were liable to be knocked out by a singlebomb.The Cabinet agreed:I- Short-term Plan.(a) That preparations should be made on theassumption that at the outbreak of warGovernment Departments will remain inthe central area*(b) That, if it becomes necessary to move the Government machine as a whole from central London, the move should bedirect to the provinces and not tothe north-west suburbs.(c) That there should be no publicdisclosure as regards the particularDepartments for which accommodation in the provinces is now being earmarked.IIo Long-term Plan.(a)    That preparations should be made onthe assumption that the departments and Headquarter Branches remaining in London in peace-time will remainin the central area on the outbreakof hostilities, and, in the event ofthe Government machine having to leaveLondon, will move direct to theprovinces.
*T) rs nci kj U(b) That all Government Departments and.   /branches of Departments not really    Irequired in London should be located in peace-time in the provinces assoon as practicable. !(c) That while,  as regards the long-term plan, the movement of non-essentialstaffs to particular areas in theprovinces may possibly indicate thegeneral direction to which GovernmentDepartments might move in the event ofan emergency, no public disclosureshould be made as to which departments would occupy any particularaccommodation in an emergency.(d) That, in order to enable essential workto be carried on during a bombardment,deep bomb-proof quarters should beprovided in the central area for the fiveWar Rooms of the Cabinet, Service Depart-ments and Home Security Organisation as aminimum, any extension depending on further investigation as to cost, practicabilityand need in the light of the generalGovernment policy in this matter.(e) That further consideration should begiven to the question of providingaccommodation for essential ForeignOffice duties.III. General.To invite the Rae Committee toproceed with the preparation of thenecessary arrangements for both the short-term and long-term plans onthe above basis as quickly aspossible.
c 9 -fc)   i-^ agriculture - 8amebdmemt) billats and Barley,(previous reference:Cabinet 6(39), Con-clusion 12,)The   Cabinet had under consideration a joint memorandum by the Minister   .of Agriculture andFisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland(CP.-45 (39)) relating to the Agriculture (Amend-ment)Bill, introduction of which had been postponedat the Meeting mentioned in the margin, pending further consideration T33? the Agriculture ministers and the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the proposalsfor an increased subsidy in respect of land underoats or barley harvested in 19580    This further examination had now taken place, and in their memorandum the Ministers recorded the view that,since it was proposed to produce in the near futurerevised permanent plans for the assistance of oats and barley, it would be undesirable to proceed withthe Bill, and that the permanent p&apos;V,a:as, when com-pleted, should be applied retrospectively, so faras practicable, to the 1958 crops of both oats and barley,,    The Memorandum indicated broadly theeffect of such retrospective provision, on theassumption that proposals on the lines of those nowunder consideration would, be approved.   The net addi^tional cost to the Exchequer would be  2,075,100or a total cost of  3,335,600o    Attached to theMemorandum was a draft announcement of the Govera-ment&apos;s proposals, which the Ministers suggested would be sufficient for present purposes.In explaining the proposals THE MINISTER OP.AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES said that it would beimpossible to deal with the 1938 barley crop onthe same basis as in the proposed permanent plans,since those plans contemplated      minimum pricearrangement with the brewing and distilling industries
which obviously could not be applied to past.sales.The arrangement for the 1938 barley crop must,therefore, be linked to oats, and he was- satisfiedthat it was impossible to avoid giving a measure ofassistance to oat-growers in respect of the 1938 crop.He said that the proposal that those who had notgrown wheat, or who had elected not to receive wheat deficiency payments, should receive the subsidy attwice the rate payable to those who had elected toreceive such payments, would ensure that the moneywent to those who really required it.   Prom enquiries which he had made in the areas concerned, he was satisfied that the position was really serious .Turning to the draft announcement, the ministers aid that he would like to include in it a statement to the effect that, as part of the long-term policy,it was proposed to effect a degree of separationbetween assistance for wheat, barley and oats.    Theeffect would be that, although those who receivedwheat deficiency payments would not be disqualified from receiving subsidy on barley and/or oats, theywould receive subsidy in respect of oats at a lower rate than those who did not receive assistance underthe Wheat Act.   He asked for authority to include astatement to this effect, in very general terms, inthe draft announcement.    If this was not done he was-afraid that there was a serious risk that the acreageunder barley would tend to decrease and workers wouldbe turned off.The Cabinet agreed -(l) That the Agriculture (Amendment) Billshould not be proceeded withe(.S) That the permanent policy in regard tobarley and oats should, so far aspracticable, be applied retrospectivelyto the 1938 barley and oat crops.
(3) That the draft announcement appended toeCP.-45 (39) should he amended by theinclusion of a statement, in general terms, setting out the proposed futurerelation of the assistance on wheat,barley and oats, and that the terms ofthis revised statement should bediscussed by the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Agriculture Ministers./
