The Chiefs of Staffendorsed generally the Secretary of State&apos;sproposals0
1 i oTHE SECRETARY OP STATS FOR WAR said that whenhe had first put forward proposals for the Role ofthe Army a year ago, he had been governed by the hopethat we should not have to send land forces to theContinents     The proposals which he had then formulatedhad therefore, been more restricted than those which hewas now making*After the September crisis   the Defence ministers had been invited to put forward proposals to remedygaps in our defences to the Committee on DefencePrograrrmes and Acceleration.     Accordingly, a paper had been prepared by the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff in regard to deficiencies in the Army.      that document had been submitted to the Committee, which had reached the conclusion that the Paper would more appropriately be dealt with by the Committee of ImperialDefence.     He had himself revised the proposals preparedbythe Chief of the Imperial General Staff, and had submitted a smaller scheme to the Committee of Imperial Defence.That Committee had decided that the proposals should beconsidered by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, and theCabinet now had before them the Chiefs of Staffs1 Report(CP. 28 (39)).The Secretary of State for &quot;War then went through this Report paragraph by paragraph, and drew attentionto its salient points.     He invited particular attentionto the statements in paragraphs 15 and&apos;^16 as to the attitude which Prance might in certain circumstances adopt in theevent of a war on the Western front,-.In regard to paragraph 20 he emphasised that theGeneral Staff were greatly perturbed lest the present state of affairs might result in our soldiers having to run undue end unnecessary risks if they were sent overseasas at present equipped0
As regards the proposed Colonial&apos;divisions, he emphasised that these divisions were at presentusing equipment which was part of what had teen providedfor the Field Force.In paragraphs 26-29 the Chiefs of Staff ineffect supported the whole of his proposals.He thought that his proposals must he regarded asmodest..     It was the view of the Chiefs of staff that it was essential that the Army should be properlyequipped, and that the Field Force which we were atpresent authorised to prepare for service overseaswas too small.It might be said that these proposals wentbeyond the proposals which he had made to the cabinet a year ago;    but he thought that it was necessary to regard the matter in a somewhat different light today.He also emphasised that his proposals were not intendedto increase the size of the Army, but only to make effective the Army as it existed, today.     As an exception to this statment, certain increases might be requiredfor particular technical units, but suili increaseshad no relation to the present Paper.As regards the Territorial Army, there was no justification for leaving them without a full scale of training equipment.THE PRIME MINISTER said that when the cabinet had discussed the role of the Army on previous occasions the-intention had been to provide anArmy suitable for general purposes.     For example,the Army might be required to serve in the middle east, or, if need be, it might be despatched, tothe Continent,     But there was no intention that
it should be specially equipped for service on theContinent.      The present paper proposed to alter thatconception and to equip 4 divisions of the RegularArray and the mobile division (which it was proposed tosplit into two) on the Continental scale;    a contingent of 4 Territorial Divisions was also to be equipped for Continental service.In addition, there was to be a Colonial Porceof 2 d-ivisions which was to be equipped for general service in any part of the world.     He asked theSecretary of State for War whether this was a correct statement of the present intention,THE SECRETARY OP STATS POR WAR confirmed thatthis was the case.      The 4 Regular divisions and the4 Territorial divisions would be equipped oh a modern scale and would be capable of serving anywhere.The main difference between the Continental scale and the scale required for service elsewhere lay inthe increased reserves of ammunition which the formerentailed.      The 18 Battalions which it was proposedto organise into two &quot;colonial&quot; divisions  comprisedunits outside the Regular Field Force, which itwas proposed should be organised so as to fit themfor minor campaigns.THE PRIME MINISTER said he thought thatthis was a rather new conception so far as our plans were concerned.The Prime Minister said that theSecretary of State for V/ar had described his proposals as modest.     Far larger proposals could,
of course, have been submitted,,     At the same time,the total -jost of the items in the Secretaryof State&apos;s paper amounted to  81 millions.     No doubt the Chancellor of the Exchequer would deal with thefinancial side of the proposals.     Speaking generally,he thought it was clear that an unanswerable casecould be made out for increased armaments in everyarm, if the financial aspect of the proposals wasignored.     But finance could not be ignored since our financial strength was one of our strongest weapons in any war which was not over in a short time.     TheChancellor of the Exchequer would, no doubt, say whether he thought that we could continue adding to defence expenditure at the rate of the last few months.     As a former Chancellor of the Exchequer,the financial position looked to him extremelydangerous.      In paragraphs 15 and 15 the Chiefs ofStaff used the argument that, unless the french were satisfied with the extent cf our efforts, theycould not be relied upon to carry out their obligations to come to our help in the event of aGerman attack on this country.     The Prime minister thought it was likely that as soon as the staff conversations started, the size of the land foroeswhich we could supply would at once arise.     Porhis part, he would greatly regret if Staff Con-versations took place on the basis of argumentswhether each country was making their fair contribution,He thought that the discussion should take placerather on the line of how the combined resources ofthe two countries could best be utilised.   Hitherto,
owing to the great caution which had been exercised in staff Conversations, there had never been any opportunity to approach the matter on these lines.     Ifwe now decided to talk more freely, we could disclose the whole position as we saw it, and it might be hopedthat when the French knew the whole position, they would appreciate not only what a gigantic effort we had made,but also that in the common interest the best course might be that we should not attempt to expand our land forces other   was also the time factor.     In the paper which the Secretary of State for War had circulateddealing with Measures to&apos;Accelerate the Despatch of theField Force to the Continent (CP. 34 (39)), it appeared that under present arrangements a Field Force of4 Divisions and 1 mobile Division could not be assembledOverseas before the 52nd day of mobilisation.      certain measures were proposed to accelerate the position, butthey- would take time to carry out.      He thought that ifthe French were given the choice of 4 Divisions and a mobile Division available in 52 days and a smaller forceavailable at an earlier date, they might be greatly influenced by the time factor.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that itPR, (o [-bet) ct.was necessary to include financial resources among our total available resources.     In the year 1937-38, theArmy Estimates (including moneys made available under theDefence Loans Act) stood, at  82 millions.     The proposalswhich were now under discussion were therefore broadlyequivalent to the whole cost of the Army in 1937-38,Next year the ,4rmy Estimates would stand at about  160 millions and the total for the three defence services would be over  500 millions.     He (the Chancellor
4     Oi i oof the Exchequer) entirely accepted the view that, inthe present circumstances, there was no alternative but touse borrowing powers.     It must be appreciated, however,Ithat there were limitations to what we could borrow.     Itwas already clear that the existing borrowing powers were inadequate and shortly he would be putting before hie colleaguesproposals for doubling the existing borrowing powers.Further, it was clear that even this increase would not meet the aggregate defence needs over the 5 years to march, 1942.In the Budget for the Financial Year 1938-39,the Chancellor, said that he had provided for the largestsum ever provided 4a^by this country for defence,.     Thefigure was  256 millions, or if provision for A,R,P* was included,  270 millions.     Since then there had been adepression in trade and considerable falling off in the productivity of certain taxes.     It is unlikely, therefore,that revenue would provide  270 millions in the current year as anticipated, and there would be a substantialBudget deficit.    \ In the ensuing year there would be avast gap to bridge between the sum available for defencefrom the Budget and a defence expenditure of over  500millions.      Further, he was extremely anxious as to theposition in later years.      The peak year of defence expenditure was always receding, and under present plansthe rate of defence expenditure in 1940-41 would exceeddefence expenditure in 1939-40.      Further, it was nowbecoming clear that the maintenance of the defence forces now being equipped would cost an annual figure far inexcess of any figure which we had ever raised out ofrevenue to meet defence services.      It would be substantially in excess of  300 millions a year.It v/as out of the question to conemplate borrowing
for a continuing annual charge.     It was impossible to escape the conclusion that we were advancing to a positionin which tJic- financial situation would get altogether outof hand.The Chancellor of the Exchequer also invitedattention to two other considerations.     A year ago,the Cabinet had very deliberately decided to work on the ration principle and had reached a conclusion that a totalof  1650 millions should be made available for defence purposes^     The Minister for Go-ordination of Defence hadbeen given the task of allocating this sum and in theprocess of allocation the sum had been somewhat increased.Since then matters had developed rapidly and it was clearthat the total defence expenditure which we were nowfaced with over the five years, April 1937 to March 1942,enormously exceeded the total of a year ago.- Every addition,suchas was involved in the proposals now made by the Secretaryof State for War added to our already gigantic financial burden for defence.The Chancellor of the Exchequer did not disputethat the proposals submitted to the Cabinet that morningby the Secretary of State for War could properly berepresented as both urgent and necessary.     But had theyany better claims to be so described than, for example,proposals in regard to further financial assistance to agriculture and shipping, an extended shelter policy,or proposals submitted by the Foreign Office to find moneyto help States in the East or the Far East, or theincreased A.D0G.Bo Programme which he understood was shortly to be submitted.     He v/as satisfied that, not only he
4 Qf\JL 0 Uhimself hut   all. his colleagues would find themselves,greatly embarrassed by the problem of how all theseproposals could possibly be financed.He agreed with the prime Minister&apos;s view thatour financial strength was an element of the greatest importance, but he was gravely disturbed les^f thatstrength might be slipping away.     During the previousAutumn he had been faced with serious difficulties in maintaining the level of the pounds     Once a loss ofconfidence showed   /iself on a wide scale, there would beno means of arresting it.     We might be faced with a financial crisis as grave as that of 1931, but with theadded difficulty that the foreign situation was now far more serious.     The Chancellor of the Exchequer, therefore,felt bound to ask whether it was really necessary toadopt all the proposals made by the Secretary of State forWar, at any rate, in their present form, and whether asubstantial reduction could not be effected.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, while he appreciated the importance of the time factor, he thoughtit was very desirable that the new Minister for Co-ordination of Defence should have an opportunity of considering these proposals before any final decision was reached.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR HOME affairs said he attached importance to due consideration being given to the proposed increases in the air defence ofGreat Britain.     He thought it was important that thereshould be no alteration in the general priorities whichhad been laid down in regard to our defence policy.
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR said that,the proposals for revision of the A. D. G. B. programme which involved increasing the total number of guns to 3,800 at a capital cost of 35 millions would beready for consideration in about a week&apos;s time.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR thought thatit would be advantageous to examine and deal withthese two proposals together.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he thought it was very difficult for otherMembers of the Cabinet to judge the issue before them.They were faced with two sharply conflictingnecessities each of which commanded their intellectualallegiance.      He agreed that there was much to besaid for the Cabinet viewing the position as a whole.At the same time he thought that it Was undesirable that there should be any delay longer than 9. week or so at the most, in determining these difficult questions.He said that the reply of the FrenchGovernment to the diplomatic approach which hadbeen made to them in regard to Staff Conversationshad just been received.     He thought there were strongIndications in that reply that the French opinion wassensitive in regard to the size of the field force to be sent by this country to France,
1 ,Q 9Jl *J the Foreign Secretary added that while he realised the full force of what the Chancellor of theExchequer had said, he wondered whether the present     ,wholly abnormal conditions were such as to make itunjustifiable that we should borrow for current defence expenditure for a period.     He was satisfied that thepresent state of tension could not last indefinitelyand must result either in war or in the destruction ofthe Nazi regime.      We could argue therefore that wewere borrowing in respect of a period which could not last indefinitely,THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE said that theForeign Secretary had expressed what many of them werefeeling.     From one point of view we were already at warand had been for some time.      He thought that it was contrary to reality to aggregate defence expenditure over a five-year period up to March 1942, and to say thatwe could not afford it.      It was clear that some of theconditions under which we were now living could not lastmuch longer - perhaps not for another year - and thepresent was probably the crucial year.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH called attention to paragraph10 of the Chiefs of Staff Report,      He thought that whatever steps were taken as to its rSle, the Avmy in*frhj,s countr-y would have to act as an arsenal in time ofwar;    he suggested that a decision in regard tocreating an increased potential action should be taken at once.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought it wasimpossible to agree to the creation of additional
capacity &quot;until it had been decided what that capacitywas needed for.      He agreed with the Foreign secretary that there must be no long delay in reaching decision.At the same time he did not feel that the urgency was so great as to make it undesirable to await the new proposals for A.D.G.B.     He would like to propose thatthe discussion should be adjourned in order that thewhole problem should be further examined by theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of Statefor War and the new Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence as soon as the latter had taken up his dutiesnext week.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that if thiswas the view of his colleagues he must acquiesce in it,but he had rather hoped that they might be able toagree without any further delay to certain of theproposals in his Memorandum.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS saidthat the items required under heads 2, 3 and 5 representedfor the most part reserves of articles for whichcapacity already existed.      For some of these articlesthe orders already placed were now running out.     Hesuggested that, in such cases, arrangements might bemade between the Treasury and the war Office for repeatorders to be placed at an early date in order to avoidgaps in production.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he offered no objection to this suggestion.     He assumed that detailed proposals would be submitted to and agreed with the Treasury.
The Secretary of State for War then referredto the proposal in paragraph 5 (h) of his Paper forthe provision of the necessary training equipment forthe remainder of the Territorial Army (i.e., theTerritorial Army less the 4 divisions for whom provisionof war equipment and reserves was proposed) at an esti-mated cost of  11 millions.     He felt very strongly the failure to give the Territorial Army a full scale of training equipment.     To some extent the presentposition meant that the Government were participating ina deception, since the Territorial Army did not realise that no provision was being made for their equipmentbeyond the inadequate scale of training equipmentat present provided.THE MINISTER OP AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES saidthat the present position was very discouraging tothe Territorial Army.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that theCabinet had already accepted the principle that theTerritorial Army should have sufficient equipment toenable it to train properly in time of peace.     Thedetails of the present proposal should be put beforethe Treasury, but he was prepared to accept it inprinciple.     He realised that the figure of  11 millionsrepresented the cost of/equipment for 8 divisions only,and that the corresponding figure for the 12 divisions would be in the neighbourhood of  15 millions.THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR WAR then raised theposition of the mobile division.     At the present timethe mobile division consisted of 9 Tank battalions, 1armoured car regiment, 2 infantry battalions and 2regiments of Artillery.
He proposed that the existing mobile division shouldbe re-organised into two smaller Divisions9 eachof which would contain 6 Tank battalions5 theremaining units being organised in a separategroup.    This involved the addition of three Tankbattalions.    To meet this s he hoped to obtain oneor more Tank battalions from India under the pro-posals in Lord Chatfield&apos;s Report3 and to convertone armoured battalion into a Tank battalion.    Inthe opinion of the General Staff this proposal was urgently necessary and should be effected beforenext year&apos;s training season.After some discussion it was decided that thisproposal should be deferred for discussion with theremainder of the Secretary of State for War&apos;sproposals.The Cabinet agreed(l) To give general approval to theproposal that all 12 infantry divisions ofthe Territorial Army should beprovided with-a full scale oftraining equipment;    the detailsof this proposal to be discussed between the Treasury and the WarOffice;(2) That the War Office should approach the Treasury in regard to anyarticles of equipment which form part of items (2j?

Priority inthe provision of this equipment shouldbe afforded to Malta.(b) In view of the incomplete state of our fighter defences at home, the allocation of any additional trained fighter pilotsto overseas Commands is not consideredjustifiable0(c) The acceleration of the formation of theproposed fighter squadron at Malta is notjustifiable in present circumstances,(d) The early provision of a fighter unit at aden is practicable provided the Admiraltycan agree to surrender a proportion (16)of the Gladiators now in store for theFleet Air Arm0(e) No acceleration of the provision ofadditional Bomber or G.R.

Broadly, the position was that theCommittee of Imperial Defence had reached the conclusionthat now that a considerable quantity of guns had beenprovided for A.D.G.B-,.? it was right to relax the absolute priority which hadb een accorded to A.D.G.B,in order to make some provision for the key ports of Malta.Gibraltar and Adenoj
THE PRIME MINISTER said that he did not anticipate any early attack on these three ports.     At the sametime, their present undefended state constituted almostan invitation to attack, and he agreed generally withthe proposal before the Cabinet.THE SECRETARY OP STATES FOR AIR explained theproposals in his paper and said that they had beenconcurred in by the Admiralty.THE SECRETARY OP STATS FOR TEE COLONIES strongly supported the proposals, which would have an important effect from the point of view of prestige.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said he agreed tothe proposals, except that he thought that 2,000 roundsof ammunition should be provided for each gun so as toavoid having to send out further ammunition after theoutbreak of war when transport might be difficult.With reference to paragraph 8 of C.P.-30 (39),-whilethe Admiralty would provide 2-pdr. guns, they couldnot provide gun crews.The Cabinet agreed:To approve the proposals in the memoranda submitted by the secretaries of State for War and Air (C.P.-8P (39)and CP.-31 (39)) subject to -(a) further consideration being givenby the Secretary of State for Warand the First Lord of the admiralty to the scale of ammunition to beprovided for A.A. guns, at Malta,Gibraltar and Aden.(b) a settlement between the Secretaryof State for War and the First Lordof the Admiralty of the arrangements tobe made for manning 2-pdr.. guns.
