ANGLO-1TALIANRELATIONS. he Romo Con-fersations.previous reference:Cabinet 60 (38)Conclusion 4.)1.     The Cabinet had before them a Most secret memorandum (C.P* 8 (39)) containing a full account ofthe visit to Paris and Rome of the Prime Minister andthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, from11th January to 14th January, 19390THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would liketo supplement the written record by his personalimpressions of the visit.     While he had never feltany doubts as to the reception which he and theForeign Secretary would receive from the Italianpeople, he had felt some doubts as to what sort ofreception they would have from Signor Mussolini.There was always the possibility that he might facethem with a series of troublesome demands.The Prime Minister said that he had been veryfavourably impressed with Signor Mussolini&apos;sdemeanour and attitude throughout the visit.      TheDuce had appeared quite straighforward and sincere ineverything he had said, and never at any time duringthe visit had he made any statement which was in theleast embarrassing to his visitors.Physically the Duce looked fit and well.He had a strong sense of humour and an attractivesmile, and conversation with him was pleasant.     at no time during the visit had he shown the slightestsign of jealousy at the great reception given to theForeign Secretary and the Prime Minister.The Prime Minister then described the reception which he and the Foreign Secretary hadreceived from the Italian people.     It was difficultto explain how heartfelt, spontaneous and universalwas the feeling of welcome extended to them, not only .in Rome Society but by the whole Italian people.     Noadvance information had been given as to the movements of Lord Halifax and himself in Rome, but the people- 1
seemed always to toe on the watch for them, and the passers-&quot;by in the streets invariably stopped and saluted; wheresmall crowds gathered, the people clapped their handsloudly; and where &quot;big crowds collected they shouted&quot;Viva&quot;.    Throughout the railway journey in Italy therewere crowds at the stations and level crossings.The Prime Minister said that Signor mussolini had been most insistent that peace was essential for italy&apos;s development, and that peace was the policy whichhe had in mind.The Prime Minister said that he had spent two hours in - the Mineralogical Exhibition, which was a piece of clever propaganda for the Fascist Party.  Ageological survey of the country had been, carried outwithin the last few years, with the result that manyvaluable minerals had been discovered,  including coal andanthracite.    These were now being exploited.    the exhibition gave full details to show the increasing outputof the minerals and the methods of exploitation.    ThePrime Minister had felt some doubt, however, whether allthe development illustrated paid its way.Another part of the.Exhibition was devoted toBonafica and showed models of the new villages which hadbeen erected on reclaimed land.    All this work was extremely well done and designed to impress the beholderwith the efficiency and the universality  of the publicworks carried out under the Fascist regime.    In this partof the Exhibition there was an enormous notice bearing thewords &quot;IL DUCE-HA SEMPRE BAGIONE&quot;, this being a noticewhich apparently was exposed in many parts of the country.The Sports Exhibition had also been extremelyimpressive, both as regards the speed of movement and the accuracy of the co-operation and precision attained notonly by adults but also by little boys of six to eight.
There had been some criticism among the Italians ofallewing small boys to carry rifles and to drill with arms.It was evident that this form of exhibition was moreagreeable to Signor Mussolini than attendance at socialfunctions.The Prime Minister said he had been informed that count and Countess Ciano, and particularly the latter, were disposed to be anti-British and pro-German.      It had beensuggested to him that it might be advisable to take stepsto counter this tendency if it existed.     Accordingly, heand the Foreign Secretary had seen a good deal of the Countand Countess and he very much doubted whether there was anytruth in the suggestion that they were anti-British.This view was confirmed by what he had been told by a well-known member of Rome Society.Turning to the Conversations, the Prime ministers aid that the weakest spot in Signor Mussolini&apos;s statementshad been his defence of Herr Hitler&apos;s action in piling uparmaments, and, in particular, the Duce&apos;s argument that hitler&apos;s policy of rearmament must be defensive because hehad fortified the Siegfried Line.The Prime Minister said that he was convinced that signor Mussolini and Herr Hitler could not be very sympathetic to each other, and that, although they had some interests in common, their interests were not identical.     Further, herather doubted whether Signor Mussolini was aware of herr hitler&apos;s plans.     Accordingly he had on several occasionsgiven Mussolini a chance to express his real feelings of herr hitler.     He had never taken the opportunity offered to him,but had remained throughout absolutely loyal to Herr Hitler.The Prime Minister saicl that at the time he had been somewhatdisappointed at this attitude, but on reflection he thoughtthat it reflected credit on Signor MussoliniTs character.
IPALIAN RE-k?I(MS.Previouspference:cabinet 58(38)conclusion 2).tReferring to the part of the conversations whicnrelated to disarmament (page 11 of the record) the PrimeMinister said that he had taken the opportunity to suggestthat there should he an exchange of views on the matter.Signor Mussolini had accepted this proposal and had saidthat he would formulate his ideas in writingo     The PrimeMinister thought that active collaboration in this matter was all to the good0As regards refugees, Signor Mussolini had notbeen very specific but he had not been unsympathetic andhad expressed his willingness to help.As regards Italy&apos;a attitude to France, signor mussolini had in effect said that he did not intend tohave any negotiations with France until the Spanish war had been cleared up, but he had said that he would not make matters harder for the Frencho     In the meantime,however, the French papers continued to exacerbateItalian feeling by harping on matters on which Italianpublic opinion was particularly sensitiveoThe visit to the Pope had also been very success-ful.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he had nothing to add to the appreciation whichthe Prime Minister had given of the atmosphere of the visit.     He. had always thought that the main purpose ofthe visit was to allow Italian opinion an opportunity tomake itself articulate.     The British Minister to the vatican had said that the Italian people regarded the-Prime Minister as the world&apos;s lifebuoy, and he felt thatthat was a most accurate description^The Foreign Secretary agreed with the PrimeMinister that Signor Mussolini&apos;s broad instinct was for
L peace.     At the same time, he confessed that he had somefeeling of disquiet as regards the Italian attitude toPAIN. Spain and to France.     As regards Spain, Italianphilosophy was dictated &quot;by the belief that General Francobevi ousference; would pull off a quick success, and they behaved as ifbinet 60(38)Inclusion 4).    they alone had the right to intervene.     He thought thatj, j      2(^)^    ^e I&quot;^alian intervention in Spain was not nearly asunpopular as we had been disposed to regard it.     Thosewho returned from Spain were treated as heroes, whilepensions were awarded on a most generous scale to the dependants of those who were killed in the war.Some discussion ensued as to the number of italian troops in Spain.t THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that there was oneBmItalian Division while three Spanish Divisions werestiffened up with Italian troops,,inIn reply to a question, THE PRIME MINISTER saidI ythat in the statement by the Duce on page 6 of the recordIthat the Italians had not increased their artillery,aviators and aeroplanes for several months past, emphasis should be on the word &quot;increased&quot;.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he had cross-examined Count Ciano on this point (see page 9 of the record), and he confessed that he did not think that count Ciano&apos;s statement was accurate.     Lord Perth,however, thought that both Signor Mussolini and count ciano might not be in possession of the facts.     He had come to the conclusion that it was impossible to ascertain the real truth as to this matters
In reply to a question, the Foreign Secretaryadded, that if the French were to send substantial additional help to the Republican Government the ItalianGovernment would regard themselves as being free to re-consider their whole attitude in the matter.      They hadeven stated that they had thirty battalions ready to despatch to Spain in this event.Continuing, the Foreign Secretary said thatM* Bonnet had returned to this subject more than once.On the last occasion he had discussed the matter withhim in the train leaving Geneva (see telegram No. 8dated 17th January, 1959 to Paris)0      The FrenchGovernment seemed to be rather less disturbed at theprospect of the Republican Government being beaten,than as to the position which would exist when thewar in Spain ended.     In particular they were disturbedwith the position in the Balearic Islands, and theyF.R.  [3*1)1*-.  were toying with the idea of seizing Minorca so asto have some bargaining counter with which to induce the Italians to leave Majorca.The Foreign Secretary said that he had repliedthat in his view this was a dangerous game.   Further,he thought that the real protection which the FrenchGovernment enjoyed in this matter was that the italians had given us perfectly unconditional assurances that theyhad no territorial ambitions in Spain, and they couldnot now use their occupation of Majorca for bargainingpurposes.without a flagrant breach of those under-takings.
Turning to the position of Spain generally,the Foreign Secretary said that he thought itwould he desirable that a meeting of the ForeignPolicy Committee should be held early in the ensuing week to discuss certain rather disturbingpossibilities inherent in the situation.      One pointof view which no doubt might be held was that therewas no reason why the French should be bluffed outof action which they had a perfect right to take,and that continuance of the war in Spain would weakenItaly.     For his part he did not agree with that view.     Nor could he see any chance of the RepublicanGovernment obtaining mastery in Spain unless theywere given support from outside on such an extensive scale as would result in a war between the GreatEuropean Powers.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he agreed withthe Foreign Secretary and he thought it was in our interests that the war in Spain should come to anend as soon as possible.In reply to a question by the President ofthe Board of Education, THE SECRETARY OF STATE FORFOREIGN AFFAIRS said that, even if the presentoffensive should be stayed, he rather doubted whether there was any prospect of a settlement by negotiation.The Foreign Secretary added that he thoughtthat the Italians had made up their minds that they wanted General Franco to win a military victory.Count Ciano had developed the argument that withoutthe prestige of a military victory behind himGeneral Franco would not be able to reconstructSpain&apos;s national life0
In reply to a further question,, the foreign secretary referred to a message which had &quot;beenreceived from the French Military Attach.6 at Barcelona,to the effect that unless further military help wasgiven, he thought Barcelona would fall within six weeks.     That, however, would not necessarily he theend of the war.     Signor de Vayo had expressed theview that the situation was grave and critical, huthe said that the Republican line, although it hadbeen pushed back, had not been broken.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND askedwhether.the French thought that the Germans were nowsupporting the Italian claims.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that 1*1. Bonnet now thought that the GermanGovernment felt obliged to give a modicum of support to Italian claims, but not to the point of war,provided that no other country was involved.     Thisview of the situation was, of course, based on theassumption that the Italian claims represented themain centre of activity but it was always possiblethat the main centre of activity might be elsewhere.The Cabinet congratulated the PrimeMinister and the Foreign Secretary onthe success of their visit to paris and Rome:    took note of the discussions with the French and Italian Ministersrecorded in CP.8 (39) and agreedthat the Foreign Policy Committeeshould meet on MondayJanuary,at 3 p.m. to consider further theposition in Spain.
GERMANY.JRelations-with.(previous Reference:Cabinet 60 (38)&apos;i Conclusion 7.)2.     At a later stage in the meeting, THE -CHANCELLOR OP THE DUCHY OP LANCASTER said that hehad been alarmed at the contents of certaintelegrams from Berlin which had recently been circulated.     He asked whether the Foreign office could consider circulating a paper on the situation as revealed in these telegrams.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he proposed that after the position hadbeen reviewed by the Foreign Policy Committee, areport should be made to the Cabinet,,     In thisconnection he referred to the statements made in a recent Despatch from out Ambassador in Parisincluding a report by the Military Attache in Parisas to possible German intentions against Holland.He asked the Minister for Co-ordination of Defencewhether this matter could be considered by the Chiefsof Staff.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF defence said that in anticipation of this requestarrangements had been made for the   atter to beconsidered by the Chiefs of Staff, but he doubted whether it would be possible for a report to besubmitted to the Foreign Policy Committee before themeeting to be held on Monday, 23rd January.The Cabinet took note of the above.
1i *3Ml stanceBo.previousjference:jibinet 60(38),pnclusion 2).3.   THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs referred to the conclusion noted in the margin,which had authorised the Prime Minister, the Chancellorof the Exchequer and himself to decide whether a communication should be addressed to the UnitedStates Government informing them that if they wereprepared to guarantee a loan to China for stabilisationpurposes we should do likewise.     In accordancewith this decision, a telegram had been despatched tothe United States of America on the 6th January (tele-gram Noo 4 to Washington) to the effect that we wei^eprepared to introduce legislation to support theChinese currency if the United States Government wereprepared to take parallel action at the same time.By taking parallel action we meant that the UnitedStates of   America  would join with us in making a loan for currency purposes.The United States Government had repliedon the 11th January (telegram No. 15 from Washington)to the effect that they were prepared to take paralleland simultaneous but not identical action..     their general attitude had been friendly and co-operative,but the information as to the steps which they proposed to take had been somewhat vague,A telegram had been despatched to Sir robert craigie on the 16th January, asking for his views onthe position.     His reply had now been received(telegram dated 17tli January from Tokyo, No. 54),Broadly,    his.    answer was that he thought that theaction proposed would create a bit of a storm, butthat we should weather it without great difficulty.
In the meantime, the position had &quot;beencomplicated by the fact that the Chinese Governmenthad now announced that they proposed to suspend allpayments on loans secured on the Chinese customs,and that they proposed to pay dollars into a &quot;blockedaccount.      This constituted a new and awkwarddifficulty.,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said he thought that our answer should be that we wished to act in step with the United StatesGovernmento     Further, he thought that the somewhatstiffer attitude which we had taken with Japanrecently had &quot;been all for the goodo     He therefore asked that the Cabinet should authorise the despatchof a telegram to the United States Government thankingthem for their response, and saying that we intendedto proceed with examination of the details of the project for assisting the Chinese currency and thatwe proposed to keep them informed of the progress ofthis examinations.     At the same time we should ask the United States Government for some further indication of their parallel action, and we should invite their attention to the action taken by the Chinese in regardto the loan secured on the customs,?     This introduced a serious complication which would have to be adjusted.At the same time he hoped that the treasury would be prepared to think out details of the Bill whichwould be necessary if it was decided to go forward withthe proposed guarantee of a currency loan.In reply to a question from the President ofthe Board of Trade, the Foreign Secretary said that in
approaching representatives of the Chinese Government inregard to the loans secured on the customs, he did not propose to say more as regards the proposed currencyloan,than that, as the Chinese Government were aware,we had been thinking over the matter and that theaction which they had taken in regard to Customs Loansobviously made it far more difficult for us to proceedwith the currency loan.THE CHANCELLOR 01? THE EXCHEQUER pointed out the differences between the United States Government joiningwith us in the currency loan and taking some other, butparallel, actioiie      If the United States Governmentactually joined&apos; with us then if Japan was to retaliateshe could not retaliate against us alone. Further, supportof the currency would obviously prove more effective if the currency was to be supported by the UnitedStates Government as well as by the Government ofthis countryBTHE PRIME MINISTER said that as this matter had not been put    on the Agenda and notice had not beengiven of the intention to raise the question, he didnot think that the Cabinet could be asked to reach afinal decision that morning.     He wished, however, totell his colleagues that his own mind was moving some-what away from his previous view that we should not take action unless the United States of America joined with us in guaranteeing the loan.     He was influenced by two considerations:    first, that the United StatesGovernment were anxious that we should come in and thatif we took no action they would feel that we had doneless than they had in the matters     Secondly, Sir robert craigie&apos;s attitude had altered and whereas he had
previously pointed, out the dangers of the proposal,he now thought that there was little danger to heapprehended and that we should, with advantage, take action on the lines proposed.After further consideration it was agreed -That the Prime Minister, the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs should he authorised to settle the terms of the communication to he addressed to theUnited States Government on the lines suggested by the Foreign Secretary,,informing them that we were considering this matter further and asking for some further indication of their parallelaction.
ALESTINE.previous reference:Cabinet 60(38), Con-clusion 9.)MilitarySituation.invitations to theLondonConference..4,    THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE colonies said that the action of the Military authorities had been successful in checking the activities ofthe large Arab bands.     In this respect the situation was now much improved,  although a good deal still remained to be done.     On the other hand, individualacts of assassination and sabotage - particularly the former - had increased considerably.      Such action was obviously harder to control than the action oflarge bands.The Secretary of State for the Colonies thought there were two reasons for the increase in theseindividual acts of assassination and sabotage.      Thefirst was the dispute between the Mufti faction andthe Nashashibi faction.      The policy which we werepursuing was affording encouragement to the latterfaction, and the Mufti faction were now trying to shootmembers of that faction.     It was significant that themajority of recent assassinations were murders of arabs by Arabs.The second reason for the increase in individualoutrages was that the Mufti1s policy was to make as effective a demonstration as possible on the eve of the approaching London discussions.The major difficulty which still existedconcerned the composition of the delegation ofPalestine Arabs.     Prolonged negotiations had takenplace, and the upshot had been that King Ibn Saud,Egypt and Iraq,   had done their best to persuade the mufti that the Palestine Arabs should be representednot only by his friends, but also by one or two7**. /A/^h, [3a^.LZfrepresentatives of^th^r^^r^fc^es, but the Mufti had adopted a very difficult attitude and     -cared tosuggest that the delegation should consist entirely of his own adherents.--14-
Although    the representatives who had been selected were well chosen, it would be difficult forus    to accept the delegation as at present proposed,unless we were recommended to do so by the neighbouring arab countries.     We had made our views on the matterclear to Mahmoud Pash$ and to 3STuri pasha, and theywere doing their best to ensure that the delegation of Palestine Arabs was more broadly based.The second difficulty with which we were facedwas that the Mufti appeared to be adopting an absolutely uncompromising attitude as to the matters to be dealt with by the Conference.    (On this, as on other matters, our information was derived fromindirect sources, and it was impossible to be certainexactly what attitude the Mufti was taking up.)      it seemed, however, that the Mufti&apos;s attitude was that unless we accepted all his proposals there could beno settlement.      The other Arab representatives wereprepared to negotiate up to a certain point, andendeavours were being made to ensure that thePalestine Arabs did not commit themselves to extremeproposals before the Conference started.If the Mufti adhered to this attitude therewas a possibility that not only would the Conferencebe doomed to failure, but that it might never start.Nuri Pasha and Mahmoud pasha had indicated that theywould attend the Conference themselves, but if itwas clear to them that the Conference was doomed tofailure they would refuse to come.The Secretary of State for the Coloniesmentioned that a leader of the Nashashibi factionhad visited the Q&amp;kors%&amp;&amp; Secretary in Palestine andhad asked that he and his friends should be repres-ented at the Conference.     This should strengthen our
hands;   hut it would he necessary to await developmentsfor a few days before deciding whether we should acceptthe delegation as at present announced, or in someother form.As the result of these delays it was now clearthat the Conference could not start until the end ofJanuary, at the earliest.The Secretary of State for the Colonies saidthat, in conjunction with the Foreign Office, he was preparing a Paper for submission to the Cabinet.He had held it up for a time in order to include theresults of the discussions which were now proceeding in Cairo.     He proposed that the Paper should now becompleted without further delay, and circulated onFriday, SOth January.     He suggested that the matter should be considered at the Palestine Committee before it was discussed in Cabinet.The Cabinet took note ofthe above statement.
REFUGEELEM.vious&apos;erence:dnet 55i) , Con-ision 5).5.        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HOME AFFAIRS said thatthe Refugee problem now raised a number of large issues and he felt that it was necessary that there should be some central machinery for dealing with problems whichconcerned a number of Departments.    He therefore proposedthat a Ministerial Committee should be set up, comprising the Ministers in charge of the Departments mainly concerned,and that this Ministerial Committee should be assisted byan Official Committee comprising the Permanent Heads ofthose Departments-eTHE CHANCELLOR OF&quot;THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said thatthe Director of the Inter-Governmental Committee was now inBerlin, and there was some reason to believe that he would shortly bring back plans which he would recommend for acceptance,,    He (Lord Winterton) had arranged to have ameeting with the Director and Vice-Chairman of theorganisation, in Paris? on Monday nexto    It had beensuggested that the full Inter-Governmental Committee should meet on Thursday, 26th January0   This meeting might be postponed, but when held it was necessary that he should bein a position to state the Government&apos;s views.It was agreed that the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster should consult on this matter with the HomeSecretary.The Cabinet agreed -That a Cabinet Committee should be set up,composed as under -The Secretary of State for Home Affairs(Chairman)0The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs and the Colonies^The President of the Board of Trade.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.The Financial Secretary to the Treasury,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary,Foreign OfficeoThe Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of labour to keep under&quot; review questions arisingout of the Refugee problem and to reportwhen necessary to the Cabinet0
PORT CREDITSGISLATION.roviouseference:cabinet 58(38),conclusion 7).6.     The Cabinet had before them a Most secret memorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (C.P.-l(39)) informing his colleagues that,in accordance with the conclusion mentioned in the margin, representatives of the Treasury, ForeignOffice and Board of Trade had met in order to deter-mine which foreign countries should receive priority of assistance under the new Export Credits Act.They had also indicated the amounts which,  in theiropinion, it would be appropriate to reserve for allocation to each of them, as follows:-3   e  oCHINAGREECEPORTUGAL (if required)EGYPT (if required)ROUMANIAIRAK o * .AFGHANISTAN , . .IRAN AND SAUDI ARABIA 3,000,0002,000,0001,000,0001,000,0001,000,000500,000250,000250,000 9,000,000This figure left  1,000,000 in reserve for unforeseencontingencies, for part of which Bulgaria and yugoslavia would be eligible.    In asking hiscolleagues to approve this proposal, the Secretaryof State explained that its purpose was solely toprovide a guide to the amount of credit, in the caseof each country, within which applications from united Kingdom exporters or foreign buyers could usefully be considered and submitted for Treasurysanction,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS,having introduced the Memorandum,  a general discussion took place, in the course of which
reference was made to telegrams which had &quot;beenreceived from our Minister at Athens to theeffect that great caution should he exercisedbefore any loans were made to the present GreekGovernment.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR drew attention to apparent differences betweenthe list set out in the Foreign Secretary&apos;sMemorandum and the Memorandum drawn up by theChiefs of Staff as to the relative strategic importance of countries requiring arms fromthe United Kingdom (C.I.D. Paper No.  1488-B).It was explained that the present paperdid not convey approval to any action beingtaken forthwith;    still less did it representany rigid order of priority.    It was onlyintended to provide a provisional scheme for allocation of the  10 millions credits which underthe Bill now before the House of Commons, might begiven by the Board of Trade, with consent.of theTreasury, without reference to the Export GuaranteesAdvisory Council.The Cabinet took note of theMemorandum submitted by theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs (CP.  1(59)),

8-      THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said thathe wished to draw the Cabinet&apos;s attention to something which had happened in regard to the Indian IncomeTax (Amendment) Bill now passing through the IndianLegislature which affected British revenue.   *It was a well understood principle that a country is entitled to levy income tax on the wholeof the profits of a Company which has its seat ofcontrol in that country.     It is also an acceptedprinciple that if part of the profits of that company are earned in some other country, that other countryis entitled to levy income tax on the part 6f theprofits earned within its area.These principles had met with general acceptance, not only within the Empire, but by foreigncountries, and formed the basis of a number ofconventions.The present proposal was that the law inregard to Indian Income Tax should be altered, andthat a Company which had its seat of control outsideIndia, but which earned half or more than half itsprofits in India should pay tax to the IndianExchequer on the whole of its profits.     This, bfcourse, entirely cut&apos; across the principles which hehad mentioned.Further, in this country we  had arrangements whereby we pay compensation to those income taxpayers who pay double income tax- up to the limit of half our own rate of tax.     The result, therefore,of the alteration in the Indian income tax law towhich he had referred would be that the British tax payer would have to pay more in compensation to. Companies which had their seat of control in this
country and which earned more than half their profits in India.There was the further point that, the action taken by the Indian Government might he copied by governments elsewhere, with unfortunate results.The Clause in question had been passed in theIndian Legislative Assembly early in December, butthere had been no consultation of any kind with theTreasury or Inland Revenue, and the matter had not beenbrought to his notice until a few days ago.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said thathe did not suggest that we should now insist on animmediate repudiation of this proposal by the indian government, since this would no doubt result in abitter controversy with the political interests inIndia which supported it.     He thought, however, thatit was his duty to invite the Cabinet to take note of what had happened.     He suggested that theSecretary of State for India should inform theViceroy of the feeling of the Cabinet on the matterand should ask him to take such steps as might bepossible to get the matter put right as early aspossible.     The Chancellor added that he understoodthat the Bill had now passed through the IndianLegislative Assembly and was now being considered bythe Council of State.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA said thathe did not dispute the objections to what had happened which had been put forward by   theChancellor of the Exchequer, although he,. ,thought that on grounds of merit, there
might he something to he said for the proposal.     he agreed that it was most unfortunate that this clause in the Indian Income Tax Amendment Bill had taken this form, and that this had happened in circumstances which had made it impossible to consult the treasury and Inland Revenue.The Secretary of State for India said that theIndian Income Tax Amendment Bill was a complicatedmeasure and that two clauses, IV and V dealing withinterpretation of residence of individuals, and companies respectively had been the subject of fiercecontroversy.     As originally drafted, these clauseshad been innocuous from the point of view of theChancellor of the Exchequer and they had emerged in aninnocuous form from the Select Committee.     When theBill reached the Assembly, however, these clauseshad. been violently attacked, first of all by therepresentatives of the Congress Party, then by the moslems and the European Group.     The Government hadthus been left without any support on these two&apos;&quot;clauses.     The Indian Finance Member had threatened to drop the whole Bill.     This had given rise to a difficult situation, and he had then said that he was prepared to consider changes in these two clauses,with the result that a bargain had been done over the floor of the House and the clauses as they now stoodhad been accepted as a compromise by all parties.The matter had been reported to the Secretary ofState after the bargain had&apos; been GOiicludede   Hegreatly   regretted   that   this   had   happened
and he was grateful to the Chancellor of theExchequer for the considerate way in which hehad dealt with the matter.    He was fully preparedto accept the suggestions made ay the Chancellorof the Exchequer.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE saidthat he had fought proposals of this naturesuccessfully, when put forward &quot;by foreign countries,and that it was alarming to hear that a clause ofthis kind could he agreed to by the Governmentof India without any kind of consultation.    He was afraid that what had happened would enormouslyweaken our position in resisting similar proposals from other countries.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he took a veryserious view of the matter.    The bargain which hadbeen struck in the Indian Legislature not onlyaffected the British taxpayer, but controverted a principle which had been followed for a long timein the face of attempts by other countries to alterit.    It was most unfortunate that such action should have been taken without any kind of consultation..    Nevertheless, he had reached theopinion that it was impossible to take any immediate action to redress the matter without giving rise to very serious controversy in India.He therefore agreed to the course proposed by theChancellor of the Exchequer.
The Cabinet agreed:-(a) That the Secretary of State forIndia should invite the Viceroy&apos;attention to the views expressedby the Cabinet in regard to theaction which had been taken bythe Government of India, andshould make it clear that theCabinet regarded the matter in avery serious light.(b) That, while recognising that no immediate action was possible,the Viceroy should be asked toconsider what steps could be takento remedy the situation at asuitable opportunity..

MOST SECRET-TO BE OPENED PERSONALLY BYOn nis majesty s service
NOT CIRCULATED *&apos;CABINET 1 (59)T CONCLUSION 9.CURRENCY     LEGISLATION.Statement by,the Chancellorof the Exchequer.* * 9THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that hiscolleagues would, of course, have seen the announcementof a transfer of gold worth  350 millions at current prices from the Issue Department of the Bank of england to the Exchange Equalisation Account, and. the promise of consequential legislation.   He explained the circum-stances as followsFor a considerable period up to about a. year agothere had been a great flow of capital funds towardsLondon, mainly from people in European countries whowere afraid to leave their money there.    The  800 millionsworth of gold which we held last April represented inconsiderable measure the accumulation here of refugeemoney of this kind, and gave to our financial positionan appearance of strength which was in part misleading.Since last April anxieties on the part of foreigners as to the fate of this  country in the war which they regarded as impending had led to a greatefflux of these funds,  chiefly to America., which was regarded as a safe repository. A return which we had recently made public showed that some  150 millions ofgold was lost between the 1st April last and the 30thSeptember last.One would have hoped that with the Munich settle-ment the drain on the pound would have subsided, butthat was not what had occurred.    It appeared only tooevident that the view continued to be persistently
held abroad that war was  coming and that this  country might not be ready for it;    and lying behind that anxietythere was, of course, the further anxiety created by the obvious worsening of our financial position, by the heavyincrease in the adverse balance of our trade, and by thegrowth of armament expenditure.    In the three months fromthe 1st October the drain had continued, the value ofthe pound falling from a top figure earlier in the year of 5 dollars to a figure little above 4-60.    The chancellor was afraid that it must be said that the recent conditionshad been painfully reminiscent of those which obtained inthis  country immediately prior to the financial crisis of September, 1931.At the turn of the year it had become necessaryto replenish the gold in the Exchange Equalisation Account,and it was decided that the best, course was to act on abold scale, removing from the Bank of England all thegold put into the Bank since the time when the Exchange      ,Equalisation Account was first set up and providing that account with the maximum possible sum for the present andfuture defence of the pound.The Chancellor hoped that this measure would havea good effect, though another shock would await when thefigures of our finances for the next Budget came to beportrayed.The big transfer from the Bank of England to theExchange Equalisation Account appeared to have had a .considerable effect on &quot;bear&quot; speculators, as showing that we had every intention of maintaining the pound.The Chancellor was glad-to be able to say thatthe drain that we had suffered was so far an externalone, and that there was as yet little or no evidence ofa flight from the pound by British nationals.-S-
0 AThe measure that we had taken involved raising the fiduciary issue no less than  140 millions abovethe normal statutory figure.   Arrangements in regardto raising the fiduciary issue were normally dealt withby Treasury Minute.   The ineres.se now proposed, however,was so large.that it was desirable that the change shouldbe made by legislation.   For this and for other reasons it had been decided, to introduce legislation, and itwas very desirable that this legislation should, be -passed as early as possible after Parliament re-assembled.He (the Chancellor) was in consultation with the Bank ofEngland and his advisers about the form of the legislation,but at the moment he could not give any precise indication of it.What the Chancellor asked, if his  colleagues agreed, was that he should settle the terms of thelegislation as soon ;as he could with the Prime Minister,and that he should be authorised to bring the bill before the Committee of Home Affairs in time for its presentation to the House within a few days of the re-as s embly.18th January. 1939 .
17th January, 1939.Dear Bridges,I enclose a copy of the stuff which we havesuggested to the Chancellor that he should say at theCabinet tomorrow.    The Chancellor has not said whether he likes it or not.    I assume that he will talk raore orless on these lines.Cabinet Minute about the statement should go on the secret Cabinet file, but should not be circulated.You will see that we have suggested that theYours sincerely,E.Bridges,K.C.B.

9,      THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER referred .to the announcement which had. appeared, in thePress on the 7th January that gold worth  350 millionsat current prices had &quot;been transferred from the issuedepartment of the Bank of England to the exchange equalisation Fund, and that in due course legislation would he introduced to authorise an increase in thefiduciary note issue to  400 millions,.The Chancellor, made a statement in regardto this matter (The full details are reproduced inthe:Secretary&apos;s standard file ofCabinet ConclusionsJl &quot;After hearing the Chancellor&apos;s statement,the Cabinet agreed -(1)    That the Prime Minister and theChancellor of.the Exchequer, inconsultation, should have authorityto settle the terms of the draftBill:(2)    That the Chancellor of the exchequer should he authorised, to &quot;bring thedraft Bill &quot;before the Committee ofHome Affairs with a view to its presentation to the House of Commonswithin a few days of the re-assemblyof Parliament,, without further reference to the Cabinet.
BOMB OUTEAGES-r    10.   THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR HOME AFFAIRS saidthat a letter had &quot;been addressed to the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs &quot;by representatives of theIrish Republican Army to the effect that unless GreatBritain withdrew her troops from Ireland within a periodof four days, which expired on the 16th instant,retaliatory action would be taken.It was explained that this communication hadbeen forwarded to the Dominions Office, who had not taken the threat seriously, and that the matter hadnot been brought to the notice of Scotland Yard until some time on the 16th instant, after explosions hadalready taken place.The Home Secretary said that he had been in communication with the Chief Commissioner of Police forthe Metropolis, who had decided to raid the houses ofknown members of the Irish Republican Association inLondon and Manchester.      The raids had taken placethat morning.     Large quantities of explosive had beenfound in London and Manchester, together with arms,pistols and mauser rifles.     In one case near Londonparticulars had been found of power stations and postoffices, and it seemed clear that it had been intendedto attempt the destruction of mails on a large scale.The raids were still continuing, but it was clear thatthey had been successful and that a good deal ofmaterial had been collected.The question of what x^FOceedings should be takenin the cases of the 15 or so persons who had been arrested would have to be considered.
. THE MINIS TEE. OP TRANSPORT said that no.substantial damage had taken place, but it wasdisquieting that the persons concerned had aconsiderable knowledge of our electrical -stations.If they had been in possession of more effectivebombs the   damage done might have been almostincalculable.The Cabinet took note of theHome Secretary&apos;s statement.
RECALL OP 11.   THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had receivedPARLIAMENT.--- a letter from the Right Hon. CP.. Attlee, MtP. , theRequest ofLabour Leader of the Labour Opposition, asking for theOpposition.immediate summoning of Parliament to consider thesituation in regard to Spain.Spain.The Prime Minister said that this requestwould he duly considered, hut he did not think thathis colleagues would favour the proposal that parliament should reassemble before the date already agreed uponThe Cabinet expressed generalagreement with the views ofthe Prime Minister.
12.    THE HOME SECRETARY informed the Cabinet that,at a Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence heldon the 23nd December last, it had &quot;been agreed -&quot;That the question of the immediate move of essential Executive Departments ofthe Air Ministry to Whitehall should &quot;befurther considered as a matter of urgencyby a Committee of Ministers composed asunder:-Secretary of State for Home Affairs(Chairman).Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.Secretary of State for Air.President of the Board of Education.First Commissioner of Works,whose report should be considered by theCommittee of Imperial Defence as early aspossible in January 1959e&quot;The Home Secretary explained that arrangements had been made, with the Board of Education1s assent,for a large portion of their basement accomodation to be made available for the use of the Air ministry in the event of war.     In view of the present uncertaininternational situation the Secretary of State for Airhad reached the conclusion that, if the departments of the Air Ministry in question were to functionsatisfactorily in the accommodation allotted to them at the Board of Education in emergency, it was essentialthat the move should take place in time of peace, andhe had therefore reluctantly come to the conclusionthat the Board of Education must be invited to surrender the necessary accommodation in Whitehallfor the Air Mini stry, and for themselves to moveelsewhere.The Home Secretary said that the Committeeappointed by the Committee of Imperial Defence had con-sidered the matter very fully at a Meeting on Tuesday,17th January,   at   which   they   had   considered  ;statements   submitted   by   the   Departments
A 1concerned.    In the Committee&apos;s view, the dominantconsideration was that in the event of a suddenattack on this country it was vital that the headquarters of the Air Ministry should he inthe best possible position to exercise central,direction and control of operations.,    On this ground the Committee had unanimously agreed that,in view of the present uncertain state of Europe,notwithstanding the inconvenience which would be caused to the Board of Education and the loss of contact with the Ministry of Health, the publicinterest demanded that the Air Ministry should nowmove into the quarters at present occupied bythe Board of Education in Whitehall.    ThePresident of the Board had shown great publicspirit in concurring in this decision, but he had asked that the question of the continued retentionby the Air Ministry of the present quarters of theBoard of Education should be further consideredtowards the end of the current financial year, onthe presumption that,  if the international situationpermitted, the Board of Education should thenreturn to their present quarters in Whitehall.The Home Secretary said that the committee agreed that the decision to move the AirMinistry to Whitehall should be justifiedpublicly on the ground that it was desirablethat the headquarters of the three FightingServices should be in close proximity.,
Richmond Terrace, S.W.1-,18th January, 1939oTHE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that he V.was...indebted to the President of the Board of education for the attitude which he had adopted in this matter.THE PEESOTNT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION said thathe had accepted the decision on the &quot;basis of thestatement which the Prime&apos; Minister had made to theCommittee of Imperial Defence in December last, thatour defence preparations should be arranged on thebasis that we were ready to meet a sudden attack.-He felt that although it would be possible to evacuatetwo floors of the building within an hour and the restof the building within twelve hours, it would not be right to take the risk involved in postponing the move of the Air Ministry headquarters to Whitehall untilthe precautionary period.     At the same time he feltthat the consideration which influenced the decision in the present case should also influence the whole range of Government policy.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that this would perhaps be going rather further than was justified.He expressed his appreciation of the attitude which hadbeen adopted by the President of the Board of education and felt sure that the Cabinet would endorse therecommendation that the retention by the Air MinistryOfficesof the Board of Educations/should be further considered when the international situation permitted.     He fearedhowever, that the prospects that the situation wouldso permit were, at present, rather remote.The Cabinet agreed:-To approve the move of &apos;theAir Ministry to the Board ofEducation&apos;s offices in &quot;Whitehall.
