Egyptian governmenthave now allowed Governor-General of the Sudan tobe murdered and have proved that they are incapableor
or unwilling to protect foreign lives.His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore require thatEgyptian government shall:(1)   Present an ample apology for, the crime&apos;(2)   Prosecute enquiry Into authorship of thecrime with the utmost energy and without respectof persons and bring criminals to condign punisiiment(3)   Pay forthwith to His Majesty&apos;s Governmentfine of  500,000(4)   Immediately withdraw from the Sudan allEgyptian officers and purely Egyptian units ofthe Egyptian army; with such resulting changes asshall he hereafter specified(5)   Consent to increase of irrigated area inthe Sudan as need may arise(6)   Withdraw all opposition in respects here-after specifled to the wishes of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment concerning protection of foreign interests in EgyptaFailing Immediate compliance with these demandsHis Majestyfs Government will at once take appropriate action to safeguard their interests inEgypt and the Sudan.20   With reference to my preceding comm.uni.ca-tion 1 am Instructed by His Majesty&apos;s Government toinform Your Excellency that their specific require-ments respecting the army in the Sudan and protection of foreign interests in Egypt are asfollows:-

[This Document is the ^ gPerty^Hj^Britannic Majesty&apos;s&amp;oye!mmentvreturned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.]EGYPT..Decypher.    Lord Allenby,   (Cairo).November 21st, 1924,D.   7,45 p.m.      November 21st., 1924.R.   7.15 p.m.      November 21st, 1924.No. 330.My immediately following telegram contains drafttext of communication to Egyptian government.I have made it into two documents in order notto spoil effect of main part by an overload of detail.I would emphasize importance of delivering itquickly.I hold very strongly to opinion that heavy fineshould be imposed though I am aware that from our point of view it may seem undignified.    In view ofStack&apos;s death I have increased my proposed figures to half a million.    Even a million might be prefer-able.     This is the sort of sign of humiliation whichis understood here0This has nothing to do with any payment toLady Stack, Aide-de-camp and chauffeur.    TheEgyptian government will no doubt make such payment and hope to gain thereby what credit they may.I also hold to my suggestion regarding GezlrahIrrigation Shat also will strike the mind of whole country.     It does not of course affect our eventualguarantee of Egypt&apos;s wetter supply as we have promised,but
but this is not the time to mention anything advantage-ous to Egypt.Paragraph 3.E. of your telegram seems to me tobe inadequate.    It secures object but does not produce moral effect.Without inclusion of these two demands forceof communication would be, vastly impaired.   Reasonsfor our Egyptian policy have been so liable to mis-understanding by vain and ignorant minds and we have-during the last few months been so far obliged to-hold our hand and apparently acquiesce in breaches of status quo, that we must not fail to use fullythis opportunity to bring Egypt to her senses, toassert our power to harm her and to stigmatise regime&apos;of present government.It is highly necessary at present juncture to impress opinion in strongest way compatible withhumanity in order to diminish danger of having to resort to different measures in troubled times whichmay be ahead of us.You will observe that I have not mentioned orimplied separation of Egyptian Sudan Commands0   Sucha separation will be inevitable but capital could bemade out of it by Egyptians as being in a sense favour-able to them and it should be postponed for the moment.Your telegram paragraph 30D0   I do not seenecessity of including this demand.I am particularly anxious to present conmunica-tion tomorrow immediately after funeral and thereforeearnestly beg for immediate reply*
