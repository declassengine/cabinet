THE FINANCIAL        2.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave thoSITUATION.Cabinet a review of the present financial situation.Previous After setting forth in some detail the prospects of the reference:Cabinet 13 present financial year and the data at present available(.24) , Con-clusicn 1,)       regarding the Budget for 1925-26, he appealed to hiscolleagues to assist him to the utmost, by carefulfinancial administration in their respective Depart-merits, to make the necessary financial provisionwithout involving excessive taxation.    In particular,he urged that the Government should concentrate on afew great issues in the sooial sphere, such as thesolution of the housing problem and an &quot;all-in&quot;insurance scheme, rather than fritter away our&apos;resources on a variety of services which, though possiblygood in themselves , were not of vital national import-ance.In regard to armaments, the Chancellor, oi theExchequer recognised that some increase in the RoyalAir Force mast be ^faced in order to secure the safety of the country, and that there was little, if any,room for reduction in the size of the Army, though,he appealed to the Secretary of State for War to keepcarefully in view the possibility of any administrative measures for the reduction of expenditure.    In view ofthe probable necessity for the development of a l&amp;valBase at Singapore, and. the Admiralty desire for anincrease in the Cruiser Programme, he indicated thatsome investigation was required as to the rate at whichthese projects could be undertaken consistently withour financial situation and the desirability from apolitical point of view of avoiding any increase in expenditure on armaraents in the forthcoming financialTear.      Mr. Churchill proposed that the Committee of
Imperial Defence should undertake the followinginquiries: -(i) A fresh survey of the situation as awhole, and the&apos; dangers to which theBritish Empire is exposed:(ii) The desirability and practicability of renewing the decision taken by theCabinet Committee on Finance on August11th, 1919, that the Fighting Servicesl! should proceed on the assumption thatno great war is to be anticipated withinthe next ten,years, although provision should be made for the possible expansionof trained units in case of an emergencyarisine&quot;:(iii) A review of the Cruiser Programme,   -and, after an exploration of the whole situation,submit a Report to the Cabinet.While there was general agreement that theabove questions required examination, there was some discussion as to the form which the inquiry shouldtake, and the Prime Minister asked that the precise form of the inquiry and the Terms of Reference shouldbe reserved until he had had time to consult -personallywith the Ministers concerned.
3. After consideration of a Memorandum by the FirstLord of the Admiralty, urging that an early decision should be given in regard to the projected Naval base at Singapore (Paper CP.-502 (24)), the Oabinot agreed(a) To approve in principle that the NavalPase should be proceeded with:(b) That the Secretary of State for theColonies, in &quot;consultation with thoseof his colleagues who were specially interested, should consider the formof the communication to be made tothe Dominions concerned as to any contribution they might be willing tomake:(c) That the announcement of the government&apos;s policy should be made in Parliament, butthat its precise form should be carefully considered in the interval:(d) That the rate at which the Base shouldbe proceeded with should form thesubject of an investigation as partof the inquiries referred to in the;preceding Conclusion:(e).That the First Lord of the admiralty should place himself in communicationwith the Chancellor of the exchequer in regard to certain immediate expendi-ture on dredgers and other detailsdesired by the Admiralty, and for some-of which the market offered favourableopportunities.
