EGYPT.BRITISH POLICY-I -   &apos;nhe Murder of%t Lee Stack.previous lief: -cabinet 62(24)1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs explained that the Conference had been summoned at short notice on a matter of great urgency.    A telegram had been received from Lord Allenby stating that hewas making to the Egyptian Government in the name ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government at 4.45 p. mi. that day thetwo communications set forth in his telegram No.381date6. November 21st.    Lord Allenby explained that hewas acting before receiving Cabinet authority as theimmediate resignation of the Egyptian Prime Minister   &apos;was probable.     (foreign Office telegram No ..384,  dated november 22nd).In the course of the meeting information wasreceived that Lord Allenby had added, to the first of the two documents the following demand:-3. &apos; &quot;Henceforth forbid and vigorouslysuppress all popular politicaldemonstrations.&quot;The Conference discussed the situation which hadthus arisen and considered in detail the documentsas presented by the High Commissioner and theinstructions which the Cabinet earlier that&apos; day had authorised the Secretary of State for foreign affairs to forward to Lord Allenby (Cabinet 62(24)).Sir William Tyrrell and Mr.  J. Murray of theforeign Office were present- for a part of the conference to answer questions.The Conference were of the decided opinion:-That Lord Allenby had not been justifiedin acting in defiance of the expressinstructions of. the Secretary of Statefor foreign Affairs  (last paragraph of telegram Ho.220 of November 21st), butthat any advantage that might now attach to the note as approved by the cabinet would. altogether be outweighed by theappearance of hesitation, and loss of prestige which would, be involved in4isavowring Lord Allenby&apos;s action by
revoking a document which had alreadybeen communicated by our representative, andthat they had no option but to supportthe authority of Lord Allenby in dealingwith a critical situation.The Conference also approved:-The terms of the telegram which theSecretary of State for foreign affairs should send to Lord Allenby, and that the/Secretary of State for the Colonies should send to the Dominion Governments a telegram on the same lines.At the close of the Conference the Secretary of Statefor foreign Affairs. communicated&apos;the foregoing to thePrime Minister by telephone and the Prime Minister expressed his agreement.Whit ehall.Gardens,  S.W.1.,;   22nd November,  1924.
