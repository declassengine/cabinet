this Document is the Property cf His Britanniod e sty   &quot;&quot;Go ye r fane lit.&apos; jT -CABINET 1 (25).CONCLUSIONS of a Meeting of the Cabinet,held at 10, Downing Street, S.W. 1, onMONDAY, JANUARY 5, 1925, at 12 Noon.1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs drew attention to his despatch of Deoem.ber 29th, If24,to the American Ambassador (Foreign Office 0.19432/15968/18) containing the British Government1s rejoinderto the American Note of the 10th December on thesubject of the American claim for reparation.    this despatch, which had been circulated to the Cabinet thesame morning, had been drawn up in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, and oontained someamendments suggested by the Lord Chancellor.   A reply had just been received from the American Ambassador,which he had communicated to the Chancellor of theExchequer.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, in discussing the line he proposed to taxe at the forthcoming conference of Finance Ministers and representatives at paris, said that the American reply to. Mr chamberlain note of Deoember 29th. declined arbitration and repeated the previous arguments uded by the Government of theUnited States on the subjeot, but indicated that theannual payments now asxed for would not exceed by verymuch the annual payments to be made to the United States
of America in respect of the cost of their Army ofOccupation, though they would involve continuance ofthese payments for a greater number of years. He had reason to believe that the total amount involved tothe Allies as a whole by aocepting the American pro-posals would not be very large.   He expected to receive a visit in Paris from Mr Logan, the American Representa-tive., and as the result he hoped to be able to forward a definite proposal for the approval of the Cabinet.He would be glad if the Cabinet could deal promptlywith his proposal.The Cabinet agreed to the prooedureproposed by the Chancellor of theExchequer.
REPARATION.The Forth-coming Con-ferenoe inParis.(PreviousReferencerCabinet 65(24), Con-elusion 2.)2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave theCabinet a summary of the line he proposed to take upon the various questions to be considered at theforthcoming Conference of Finance Ministers and Repre -sentatives at Paris.   The Press had rather exaggeratedthe scope and importance of the Conference, and, sincethe amounts at stake were not very considerable, he proposed to take any opportunity that might offer inthe opening meeting te indicate that the conference was concerned rather with questions of detail.   Thequestions to be dealt with by the Conference inoluded&quot;Settlement of the ruhr AccountsCost of^armies.as ^of occupationBe1g ian-Pri orItyBelgian.Debt -Restitution &quot;eJRuhr Accounts.   ^ux^r^a^rvix ua the Dawes Annuities.Each of the above questions raised certain complica-tions of its own, and affected the claims of each nation in a different manner, as the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer proceeded to explain in detail.   Therewas also a certain relation between these questions and the Spa Percentages.   He intended not to departin any way from the Spa Percentages in regard toReparation, but he indicated that the special claims of the various nations in regard to the other ques-tions he had mentioned might have to be regulated in aseparate series of percentages, which might react tosome extent upon the amounts to be received under theSpa Percentages when actual payments came to be made.The Cabinet&quot;concurred in the general line the Chancellor of the exchequer proposed to take.

INTER-ALLIED 3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer indicated that,DEBTS.although the question of Inter-Allied Debts was noton the Agenda of the forthcoming Conference of finance ministers and Representatives at Paris, the question was certain to be raised outside the Conference.In this connection the Chancellor of the Exchequerindicated that he proposed to adhere to the generalpolicy as set forth in Foreign Office Telegram No.of January 4, 1925, to Sir Esme* Howard, Washington, asfollows:-&quot;     For purposes of conversation withMr Hughes it may be better slightly to alter the emphasis of the points brought out in my telegram No.357.   You should base anything you say on the followingmodified lines:The general policy of His Majesty1 sGovernment was outlined in Chancellorof Exchequers speech in House of commons on 10th December.   We do not proposeourselves to ask for most-favoured-nationterms with regard to our debt.   Questionis a moral one and we should natural.lyaccept such terms if offered.    unless such an offer is made, we are bound by our settlement.   America can i/iakewith Franoe as regards interest etc. any terms she likes without objection from us, but we of course hold ourselvesfree to make any arrangement with .Franceindependently in time or terms of America.We must, however, insist on being paid incasil BJ-LJEJL Pftssu with any cash payment to america, in the proportion of our Frenchdebt to America&apos;s French debt.&quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer made it clear to theCabinet that he intended to hold the British Governmentfree to make any arrangement with France independentlyin time or terms of America, and that the term &quot;paripassu&quot; in the above telegram did not affect this intention.He anticipated that the French Finanoe minister would raise the question with him.   In that event hewould impress on M. Clementel that we considered it theduty of F&apos;rance to pay her debt to us aii expected her(previous reference:Cabinet 65(24), Con-clusion 2.)
in the near future to make proposals for   fundingthe debt and payment of interest.    If she did not doso we should have to ask.Prance officially to do so.If M. Cl&amp;nentel should not raise the question, he proposed, if the. Cabinet agreed, to raise it himself.The Cabinet agreed on the general line proposed&quot;&apos;by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer.-5
4. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs gave the Cabinet an account of recent events in Albaniawhich had resulted in the forcible expulsion of thelate Government under Bishop Fan Nol$*and the substitu-tion of a Government under Ahmed Zoghu, who had enteredAlbania from the territory of Jugo-Slavia, probablywith the knowledge, if not the active connivance, ofthe Jugo-Slav Government.Mr Chamberlain indicated that the BritishGovernment1s polioy was to prevent this local Albanianquestion from becoming an international question.He said that he had been assured by the JfesKrah andItalian Foreign Ministers, during the recent Conferenceof the League of Nations at Rome, that they also had this object in view.
5* The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew the attention of the Cabinet to recent telegrams, whichhad been circulated,in regard to the evacuation of theCologne Area.   He had experienced considerable embarrassment in dealing with this question,. owing to thedifficulty of obtaining an appreciation of the precisemilitary significance of the defaults established bythe Military Commission of Control.    He hoped to obtainthis shortly.The Secretary of the Cabinet was instructed to ascertain whetherthe Repoxt of the Allied military commission of Control had yet been       /circulated to the Cabinet, and, ifnot, to arrange for its circulation.
ARBITRATION,SECURITY and limitation of armaments.The geneva protocol.(Pre vi ou s1 Reference iCabinet 6&amp;(24) , Con&quot;elusion 10.)6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsindicated that our Foreign Policy must necessarilyhe to -Domo o^tont.....11 froi-a hand to mouth/1 until the ..Government had decided what their attitude would betowards the Geneva Protocol on Arbitration, security and Limitation of Armaments, and, if it was to be rejected, what substitute should be offered.The Lord President of the Council, as Chairmanof the Committee of Imperial Defence, explained thatthe Geneva Protocol had already been considered at two meetings of the Committee and had been referred to a departmental Sub-Committee under the Chairmanship ofSir Maurice Rankey.    Be understood that the Sub-Committee was making good progress and would shortly be in a position to make definite proposals to the&quot;Committee of Imperial Defence, by whom they would thenbe considered.    Probably, however, the Sub-Committeewould not be able to report, as had been hoped, byJanuary 10th.
UNEMPLOYMENT.New bridge and road programme.Report ofUnemploymentCommittee.(Previous .Reference:Cabinet 56(24), Oon-conclusion 1(e).)7. After consideration of a Report by the Unemploy-ment Uommittee on the subject of a Mew Road and BridgeProgramme (Paper CP,-551 (24)), the Cabinet agreed -.-(a) To authorise the Minister of transport to allocate the sum of  632,450 fromthe estimated net surplus revenues ofthe Road Fund towards the constructionof the Newcastle-G-ateshead Bridge:(b) To reserve the remainder of the pro-posals of the Unemployment Committeefor further examination by theChancellor of the Exchequer, on theunderstanding that they would again be brought before the Cabinet within one month.
