( (This Document is the Property of His britannic -sty i S (j.0yerDmeht I ) &quot;CABINET 5 (25).CONCLUSIONS of a Meeting of the Cabinet,held at 10, Downing Street, S.W.1, on tuesday, FEBRUARY 3, 1925, at 11-30 a,m*1- The Secretary.of State for Foreign affairs invited the attention of his colleagues to a telegramhe had despatched on the previous day to Lord Crewe(No.43) in regard to a change of the French attitudetowards the evacuation of the Cologne area.   Hithertohe thought there had been general agreement among theAllies that the Cologne area should be evacuated onthe fulfilment of the military conditions of theTreaty of Versailles.   M. Herriot, however, had caused him a certain amount of mispiving by the termsof his recent speech.   Moved, no doubt, by the line taken in the German Note, M. Herriot had spoken of theoacupied territory as though it were the only security for France and had suggested that the occupationmust be continued until the security question hadbeen settled.    Following this, two telegrams had comefrom Lord DfAbernon (Berlin) in regard to a changeof attitude on the part of the French member of theMilitary Commission of Control, who had suggested anumber of additions and amendments to the draft report which threatened to make it impossible for the
British member to sign.   Within, the last few days theItalian Ambassador had paid Mr Chamberlain a visit and had told him that Signor Mussolini was anxious about the French attitude.    The apprehensions of theItalian President of the Council were duo not solely to M. Herriot&apos;s speeohes but to language that he had used to the Fr-e-neh Ambassador in Paris.    In view ofthis cumulative evidence of the French attitude theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs said he had thought it desirable to send a very frank message toM. Herriot, through Lord Crewe, warning him that anyattempt to force the British Government1s hand in thematter of the evaouation of Cologne was calculateddirectly to defeat their desire to carry publio opinion in some scheme for providingbnce and for all for Frenchsecurity, and urging him to move circumspectly and todo nothing liable to make the task of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment more difficult than it already is.
ipgBKEY AM) 2.    The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew&apos; .REEGE.the attention of the Cabinet to a situation of somexpulsion ofthe Greek difficulty which had arisen owing to the action of thepatriarch.Turkish Government in sending the Oecumenical Patriarchto Greece as an exchangeable Greek subject not exempt from the operation of the Convention for the Exchangeof Populations.    It was probable that the Greek Govern-ment would appeal to the Hague Court.   Although at themoment the question was an awkward one $ it was not impossible that in the end this action might proveadvantageous to the Greeks by resulting in the removalof the Patriarchate from Turkish to Greek territory.

This caused a certain amount of uneasinessamong the military advisers of the India Office, whodoubted as to whether it was prudent to retain theIndian Battalions after the withdrawal of the onlynon-Arab artillery.The Secretary of State for War said that, whilethe War Office had no responsibility, his advisersshared the misgivings referred to by the Seoretary ofState for India.The Secretary of State for Air stated that theAir Staff had no misgivings on the subject, owing tothe fact that there were eight Squadrons of aircraft in Iraq.The general view of the Cabinet was that,as theAir Ministry are responsible for the defence of Iraq,they should accept the advice of the Air Staff.
