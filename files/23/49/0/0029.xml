French experts had outlined certain proposalswhich they had eventually set out in an informal -aide-memoire.   -While these proposals constituted a consider-able advance on the position taken up by the FrenchGovernment a year or two ago, they were far from beingacceptable to the British Government, and the Treasuryexperts had made this quite clear.
