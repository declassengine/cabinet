BRITISH POLICYIN EGYPT.The Status ofthe egyptian army and the command ofthe SudanDefence Force.(previous reference:Cabinet 3.(25) , Con-clusion 4.)2.    The Cabinet had before them the following docu-nients in rega,rd to the status of the Egyptian Army andthe Comiiiand of the Sudan Defence Force:-A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (Paper CP.-22 (25))..A Note by the Secretary of State for War(Paper CP.-35 (25)).A Telegram from Lord Allenby to theSecretary of. State for B^reign Affairs(Paper CP.-52 (25)).The Socretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that when he had come to thinkover the decision reached by the Cabinet on January21st (Cabinet 3 (25), Conclusion 4 (b)) and to draft instructions to Lord Allenby in accordance with it, hehad felt so much concern as to the effect of thatdecision on our general policy in Egypt that he had asked and had obtained the Prime Minister&apos;s authorityto delay issuing the instructions pending further oon-sideration by the Cabinet.    Subsequently he hadreceived through Lord Staiidbrdham an expression of theKing&apos;s views on the.subject which His Majesty desiredhim to eoinmunieate to the Cabinet.    Mr Chamberlain then read Lord Stamfordham&apos;s letters.The Foreign Secretary then made to the Cabinet astatement of the policy which he had been following inrelation to Egypt and the Sudan, and explained the:;!dangers which he felt to be involved in the executionof the Cabinet&apos;s decision in regard to the appointmentof the Sirdar.After a careful examination of the position the Cabinet agreed  (a.) To approve the lines of policy.towardsEgypt and the Sudan adopted by the secretary of State for Foreign Affairs:
(b) That as records the appointment of theSirdar, the&apos; Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should inform lord allenby that the Cabinet recognisedthat the time had come when it wasnecessary to free the Command of theSudan Defence Force from any depend1-- .ence on the Egyptian Ministry.   At thesame time they felt that the presentmoment was unfavourable for bringing to an end the holding of the appoint-merit of Sirdar of the Egyptian Armyby a British Officer, which hadextended over thirty years.    To proposethis change to the Egyptian government at the present moment might, on t&amp;e? onehand, be represented as a concessionwrune from the British Government bythe tiurder of the late Sirdar, whilst,on the other hand, the result of theEgyptian elections might be a seriousfactor In the ultimate decision of his majesty&apos;s .je sty1 s Governiae nt:(c) That His Majosty1s Government did not desire to provoke a conflict with theKing or -with the present egyptian government on this issue, and did not therefore in any case propose to insist on this appointment as a condition ofgood relations;   but they thought itdesirable that Lord Allenby, ih speak-ing to the King, should assume thatHis: Majesty would naturally appointanother British Officer in succession to Sir Lee Stack as Sirdar of theEgyptian Army, and should leave nodoubt in the mind of the King or ofthe Egyptian Government of the veryunfortunate impression that would beproduced on the mind of the BritishGovernment if they took the occasion of the murder of Sir Lee Stack to break the; unvaried practice of more thanthirty years.Before this policy was carried out,however, the Secretary of State should ascertain Lord Allenby* s views as toit s&apos; p robablee ffe ct.(At the request of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs/ the Lord President of the Council undertook to co-operate in the preparation of instructions toLord Allenby.)
