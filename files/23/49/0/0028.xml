(This Document is the Property of^ His Britannic&quot;Majesty1 s Txovernme n&amp;^T^CABIN3T 19  (25).CONCLUSIONS of a Meeting of the Cabinet,held at 10, Downing Street, S.W. 1, onWEDNESDAY , APRIL 1, 1925, at il-30 a. in.j.1. The Seoretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet of the following new factors whiohhad arisen while the Dominions were being consulted on the. terms of the draft despatch to. His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Washington regarding a new naval conference for the further limiting of naval armaments and expenditure , the terms of which had been approvedby the Cabinet, subject to Dominion approval (Cabinet 9(25)j Conclusion 3 and Appendix):.-(i) Information had been received which ledhim to believe that an initiative on our part would not bo welcomed at Washington:(ii) It had become clear, in his conversations with. M. -Harriot, that a proposal for aDisaniament Conference at Washington,more particularly at this moment whenthe proposed League of Nations Confer--ence on Limitation of Armaments had hadto be postponed owing to the rejection of the Geneva Protocol, would be veryunwelcome to the French Government.In these circumstances, and having regard to thegreat importance, at the present stage of the securitynegotiations, of doing nothing to antagonise Frenchopinion, Mr Austen Chamberlain proposed that for themoment we should take no initiative with the -Ameaxboan
Government, and that he should limit his action toinforming officially the- British Ambassador in washington that if he were approached by the AmericanGovernment he should indicate that the British GoVern-ment were prepared to enter a Conference for NavalLimitation of Armaments provided that the other greatNaval Powers agreed.The Cabinet were informed that in the courseof the inquiries of the Committee on Naval Programmeit had become clear that some limitation in the tonnage and armaments of cruisers was highly desirable fromthe point of view of expenditure and was acceptable tothe Admiralty, and it was suggested that possibly this might be effected by means of an arrangement (whetherconcluded by Conference or through diplomatic channels)confined in the first instance to the three great naval powers, - the British Empire, the United States ofAmerica and Japan.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should not take any initiativeat present \vith the object of stimulat-Ing the. United .States of America tosend invitations for a fresh Conferenceat Washington, but that he should instruct the British Ambassador atWashington to state, in reply to anyinquiry by the United States Government,that the British Government would welcome such an invitation provided the othergreat Naval Powers were willing to accept:(b) That the First Lord of the admiralty should report to the Cabinet as to whether his Department considered it practicable,having regard to the existing navalposition, that some agreement (not neces-sarily involving a Conference) should be entered into for a limited term of years between the British Empire, the UnitedStaxes.of America and Japan, but withoutthe adherence in the first instance ofother Naval Powers, with the object of limiting the tonnage and armaments of cruisers.
Strength oftue EgyptianPreviousReference:nab inet 14(25), Con-conclusion 7,)2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew the attention of the Cabinet to the draft of a despatch(Paper CP.-131 (25)) to Field-Marshal Viscount Allenbyon the subject of the strength of the Egyptian Army,which had been approved by the Cabinet at the Meeting onMarch 4th, referred to in the margin.After the Cabinet had considered the natter, two considerations had been brought to his notice:    first,that the effect of the separation of the Sudanese andthe Egyptian Arrr.de s had been to reduce the strength ofthe Egyptian Army by several thousand men;   and, second,that in 1914, when the connection between Turkey and egypt had been severed, Sir Milne Cheetham, in theabsence of Lord Kitchener, had informed the egyptian government that the limitation of 18,000 men imposed bythe Turks on the size of the Egyptian Army was withdrawn.Mr Austen Chamberlain also drew the attention.-of theCabinet to Lord Allenby1 s telegram No. 76, of February18th, in which he stated that, having learned that theMinister of War proposed to suggest to the King that two more Egyptian battalions should be raised and wished toknow his views, the Field-Marshal had caused him to beinformed that he could not but regard any further increase of the Egyptian Army as injudicious.    Subsequent-ly Lord Allenby had spoken to Sidky Pasha, who had assuredhim that neither he nor the Prime Minister would agreeto such a proposal.    In the circumstances the Secretaryof State proposed not to send the despatch and to leavematters where they were.total strength of the Egyptian Army was greatly,reduced bye &apos;&apos;--s^separation of the Sudanese and Egyptian Armies, neverthe-The Cabinet were reminded. that-^lthpugh theless the number of Egyptian troops in Cairo was
considerably increased, and if two new &quot;battalionsraised the numbers might become a menace to theBritish position.The Cabinet agreed    -That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should inform Field-MarshalViscount Allenby that if any furtherproposal was made for increasing thestrength, of the Egyptian Army he should report it at once.&apos;

Chancellor of the Exchequer covering a draft Protocol   .Amendmentof R5?para- for amending the method of administering the Reparationtion XRecovery) &quot; &quot;      -Act Procedure.  (Recover;/) Act, which had been provisionally agreed toby the representatives of the British and German(previous reference:        Governments, as well as a draft Resolution to be sub-Cabinet 2(25) , Con-        mitted to both Houses of Parliament taking&quot; powers toelusion 1.)suspend the provisions of the Reparation -(Recovery)Act by an Order in Council (Paper CP.-185 (25)).After- hearing a detailed explanation of his proposals from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, theCabinet agreed --To approve the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s proposals as set forth in Paper CP.-185 (25), and that thenecessary Resolution should be moved in Parliament on Tuesday, April 7th,&quot;with a view to the passing of an Orderin Council on Y/wednesday, April 8th.
imperial war graves commission.(previous reference:Cabinet 15(25), Con-conclusion 7.)5. The Cabinet bad before them a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer containing his proposalsfor making provision for an endowment fund in connec-tion with the maintenance of the Imperial War Graves(Paper CP.-186 (25)).    The proposal provided forasking Parliament to vote annually over a term of tenyears such a sum as will, at compound interest,accumulate to the desired capital -amount at the end ofthat term.   During the ten years period the vote wouldprovide (a) for current maintenance, and (b) for contri-bution to the endowment fund.    Owing to the large capital expenditure required during the next four years,-the scheme contemplated that the first year of the contribution to the annuity should be the fifth year from the present.A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War,criticising this scheme and containing alternative proposals, was handed round during the Meeting (paper cp.-191  (25)).After considerable discussion the Cabinet agreed -(a) That it would be consistent with estab-lished financial practice to set up a fund by Statute with the object pa-rtlyof meeting current charges and partly of providing a sinking fund, and that by analogy- such a fund might be set upin connection with the maintenance ofthe Imperial War Graves, partly for thepurpose of meeting current charges andpartly fo r making provision for &apos; anendowment fund.  &quot; By including; in thefirst year provision not only for current expenses but also something inexcess of a mere token vote in conriec-tion with the endowment fund, an earnest of the Government1s intention to parti-participate in creating this fund would begiven to the Dominions:4b) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should consider this proposal, andwhether he could make the necessarystatutory provision for giving effectto it as part of the Finance Act, andshould report the details of his pro-posals at the next Meeting of theCabinet.,

Should he be*     asked to receive a Deputation after this discussion, he should avoid committing the Government&quot; in any way:(b) That a Cabinet Committee should beset up to consider the whole question,and that the Prime Minister should nominate the members.
