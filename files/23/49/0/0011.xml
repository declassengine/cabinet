The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave the cabinet a full account of the negotiations at the Paris Confer-ence on the Distribution of the Dawes Annuities andconnected questions, including the question of the share of the United States of America.    The Agreementsreached, he pointed out, had been published in the newspapers of that morning:, and would be circulated tothe Cabinet for record.The Cabinet expressed their high appreciation of the success of the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;mission, which had resulted not only in clearing up verydifficult and complicated financial questions, but alsoin an improvement of the general political situation.They approved  (a) The Agreement as regards the DawesAnnuities:(b) The following letter which had beensent by the Chancellor of theExchequer to the French Minister ofFinance on January 13th, on thesubject of the Spa Percentages:-preparation.The paris conference.The Share ofthe united States ofiAmerica in the DaweslAiinuities.(previous inference:Cabinet 11(25) , Con-iolusionsI &amp; 2.)
My dear Monsieur elemental,Our position is that the Spapercentages have been definitelyfixed by International agreement and we should be opposed &quot;to re-opening the question.    I cannot therefore do more than take note of the reserves which you have found it necessary to make.Nothing of course in the present agreement engages your Governmentto any additional degree in respectof these percentages.Yours very sincerely,(Sd.) WINSTON S.  CHURCHILL.
INTBR-ALLIBD 2. The Chancellor of the Exohequer save the CabinetDEBTS.a full account of conversations he had had with M.(Previous 0 lenient el, the French Minister of Finance, on theReferenoe:Cabinet 1        subject of Inter-Allied Debts, which, the Cabinet felti(25) , Con-clusion 3.)     offered a good starting-point for further negotiations.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Chanoellor of the exchequer should circulate Papers on the subject,with a view to an early discussion, when a decision would be reached as to the reply to be given to a request byM. Clementel for information as towhether the British Government stilladhered to the Balfour Note of August1st, 1922 (Cmd.1737) and to lord curzon&apos;s Note of August 11, 1923, tothe French Government (Enclosure No.lto Paper C. P. -390 (23)).(b) To approve the following letter fromthe Chancellor of the Exchequer toM.  Clementel, the French Minister ofFinance, dated January 13, 1925, onthe subject of the repayment of theFrench Debt:-&quot;My dear Monsieur Olementel,During my visit here you have raised in an unofficial and tentativeform the question of the repayment of the French Debt to Great Britainand have expressed to me the desire of the French Government that thismatter shall be the subject of futureconversations.    I have reoeived theseintimations with pleasure.   His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had been inclined to expect the question to be raised and it iscertainly more appropriate that theInitiative should have been spontane-ously taken by France.    I had not contemplated during my visit here onthis occasion that &quot;any questions ofmethod, terms or conditions would present themselves and therefore Ihave not so far obtained any instruc-tions from the British Cabinet in thissphere.   You have written me a letterasking that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould define its position in regardto the Balfour Note, and the Curzondeclaration of the 11th August, 1923.I have transmitted your letter to mycolleagues and I can assure you thatas soon as I return to London we willtake the whole matter into prompt andearnest consideration;   and will endeavourto send you an answer which will plaoethe Frenoh Government in a positionto present us with definite proposals.
Meanwhile I can only repeat that the balfour Note remains i&apos;or us a dominatingguide of principle set up freely by ourown hands.   We shall approach the disous-sion of the settlement of the Prenoh debt to Great Britain in the same spirit ofloyal comradeship which led us safelythrough the agony and perils of the warand will alone enable us to surmount thevexations and difficulties which still remain after the military victory hasbeen won.Believe me,Yours very sincerely.(Sd.) WINSTON S.  CHURCHILL. &quot;
