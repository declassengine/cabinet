20. The Seoretary of State for Foreign affairs gave the Cabinet an account of certain salient points which had arisen in the course of his farewell conversation with Mr Kellogg,the American Ambassador, who wasabout to take up the post vf Secretary of State atWashington.    In regard to a very confidential coromanication he had received as to the attitude of PresidentCoolidge towards the Geneva Protocol, Mr austen chamberlain had told Mr Kellogg that he did not proposeto circulate it in the usual manner (C.I.D. Paper573-B).    He had,&apos;however, pointed &amp;ut to Mr Kelloggthat if the American attitude was so adverse to the geneva Protocol, it might be very useful if some formof public announcement could bo made on the subject, r\\since such an announcement would obviously have agreat effect upon the nations which were now consider-ing their attitude towards the Protocol.   Mr Kellogghad given a very favourable reception to this proposal.Mr Kellogg had also discussed the question of disarmament, and had suggested that, having regard tothe small size of the land forces of the United Statescf America as well as of Great Britain, he had feltthat it would not be useful for the United StatesGovernment to summon a Conference to consider thequestion of land armaments.   Mr Chamberlain had thentold Mr Kellogg that M. Herriot had intimated that,in his view, Washington would not be a good centre inwhich to discuss land armaments, o^ing to its remotenesfrom the European questions with the solution of whichthis question was so closely connected.    In reply toMr Kellogg&apos;s suggestion that a Conference on navallAmiftation of armaments might be summoned moreusefully, Mr Chamberlain had suggested that the
American Government should put out &quot;feelers&quot; withother Governments as to their attitude twards theproposal.   He had himself entered a caveat in regardto the obvious difficulties of rationing the oonstruc--m or ^-f nwiiaoTs nn t,&quot;Ke same lines as capital ships 5&quot;submarine question.    In the course of a conversation which included a survey of the political situation allover the world, Mr Kellogg had expressed the view thatthe intentions of Japan were peaceful, and that althoughthe United States of America could not yield Inprinciple on the question of immigration, some meansmight perhaps bo found to save the face of Japan.saia that we should welcome a Conferenceand haa suggested that it might considersuoh questions as the&quot;nt and the-21-
