Continent of Europe on the questionof security, a settlement of whichwas vital to the complete establish-ment of peace;   that the recent pro-posals of the German Government appearedto offer the best basis for reaching asettlement on security, but that such asettlement could not possibly be reachedwithout our co-operation;     that our responsibilities under these proposals would be limited to entering Into some arrangement providing for mutual guarantee of security of the frontiersbetween Germany, on the one hand, andBelgium and Prance on the other9 towhich Great Britain, Prance, belgium and Germany would be parties;that if we refused to enter into anysuch arrangement and reverted to apolicy of Isolation, the only result would be an aggravation of the exist-Ing unrest on the Continent of Europe,leading ultimately to a fresh war.As bearing on the Eastern and Southernfrontiers of Germany, he should pointout that it was no part of our pro-posals that by entering into specialengagements In respect of the Westernfrontiers we should in any way diminish the guarantees provided elsewhere by existing Treaties.   Above all, he shouldmake it clear that, in the view of theGovernment, the peace of the worlddepends on the part which Great britain is prepared to play In this matter.(b) That the Seoretary of State for ForeignAffairs, in consultation with such repre-sentatives of the Colonial Office as he might deem desirable in the absence ofthe, Secretary of State for the Colonies,should draft a telegram for the PrimeMinister to send immediately, throughthe usual channels, to the Prims ministers of the Dominions, notifying tn them theGovernments intention to announce theabove policy on Tuesday, March 24th.(c) That the Prime Minister and the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs should seethe High Commissioners of the dominions on Monday, March 23rd, in order to explain the policy more fully.Cd) That appropriate steps should be takent,o&apos; arrange, if possible, that representa-tives of the Dominions at the next Assemblyjbf the League of fetions should arrive inLondon a fortnight before the Meeting of theAssembly, in order fully to discuss thesematters with the British Government.^e) To take note that the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs had made It clear toM. Herriot that the next step was with
the latter, and that he had asked him tostate what provisions he considered necessary as regards the Southern (Austrian)and Eastern frontiers of Germany.(f) To congratulate and thank the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs for hishandling of the situation at paris and Geneva.
