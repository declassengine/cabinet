-SECRET-(This Document is the Property of His BritanniaMl D6 s t y I Go ve rnment.)CABINET 4 (25).CONCLUSIONS of a Meeting of the Cabinet,held at 10, Downing? Street, S.W.1, onWEDNESDAY, JANUARY&apos;28, 1925, at 11-30 a.m.IRAQ,.Defence of.(previous reference:Cabinet 55(24) , Con-elusion 1(e).)1. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Air on the Defence of Iraq(Paper CP.-16 (25)), in which the Secretary of Statepointed out the need for prompt action if, In soshort a time as the mandatory period of four years,Iraq was to be put in a position to maintain order and to defend its own frontiers, thus rendering it possible for the Imperial forces to be withdrawnor gradually reduced in strength.The Secretary of State for Air summarised theposition as set forth in his Memorandum, and reminded the Cabinet that the local forces were at presentdivided into two organisations;    (l) the Arab Army,which was paid out of Iraq revenues and commanded byIraq officers, and (2) the Iraq levies, paid by theBritish taxpayer and commanded by British officers.In the opinion of the Secretary of State the first essential condition of reform was the intro-duction of British officers into the Iraq Army,and, secondly, some alteration in the present financial arrangements for British grants to Iraq
defence.    The looal defence forces were no nearerhelng ready to take over the defence of the countrythan they were two years ago.    If the eventualevacuation of the Imperial forces was to take place,the Arab Army must be made reasonably efficient,and he wished for authority from the Cabinet tc open negotiations for a suitable military agreement with king Peisal.   Assuming the conclusion of such agreement, it was improbable that evacuation could take place before 1930-31.    When that stage wasreached it was contemplated that a new Treaty wouldbe required, and in it provision could be made forany British officers remaining in the Arab Army.The Secretary of State for War stated that he hadnot yet been able to consult his advisers on theproposals set forth in the Secretary of State forAir&apos;s Memorandum.After some discussion, in the course of which theChancellor cf the Exchequer and the Secretary ofState for the Colonies generally concurred in theviews expressed by the Secretary of State for Air,the Cabinet agreed - To adjourn the subject for decision at the next ordinary Meeting of theCabinet.
