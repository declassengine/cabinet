As the desirability of thelarger inquiries was still under considerations itwas suggested that the question of Singapore should betaken up by the Committee as a separate question.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Committee of Imperial defence should at once take up the question ofthe rate at which the Naval Base at singapore is to be proceeded with, and make recommendations as to the pro-gramme to be aimed at:mo fato &quot;rt+^that the question referred1 To /take note of a telegram read by theSecretary of State for the Colonies

Harriot,the French President of the Council, on this subject,and made a statement of the general lines of the policyhe proposed to adopt towards the evacuation of the rhineland, the main heads of which may be summed upas follows:-(i) It would not be possible for the AlliedGovernments to take a decision in regardto. the evacuation of the Cologne sectionof the Rhineland as provided for inArticle 429 (i) of the Treaty ofVersailles until they had before them the Report of the investigation nowbeing conducted by the Military Commis-sion of Control.    This Report cOuld notbe available by January 10th, 1925 (whenthe first period of five years referredto in Article 429 of the Treaty wouldhave expired) , owing to the past obstruc-tion to the work of &quot;the Military Commis-sion of Control by the German Government.(ii) If the Report of the Military Commissionof Control should show that Germany hadcomplied in the main with those provisionsof the Treaty of Versailles which are capable of realisation, Germany should bedeemed to   have fulfilled the Treaty.We should insist, however, that anyminor defaults in completing the treaty should be made good.(iii) If, however, the Report showed that germany had not substantially fulfilled the Treaty,evacuation should not be proceeded with.(iv) In the event of its being found possibleto proceed with the evacuation, we should recognise that the Cologne area could notbe evacuated while the French were stillin the Ruhr, and we should endeavour to induce the French Government to agree tosome date for the evacuation both&quot;of the ruhr and the Cologne section earlier than
August 2Gth (the present date fixed forthe evacuation of the Ruhr).(v) Even when the Cologne bridgehead, whichis at present occupied mainly by Britishtroops, is evacuated, we should continueto maintain a British force side by side with the F ranch-Belgian forces in the occupied territories.(vi) It would be necessary to take Belgium,as an occupying Power, into consultation in regard to the decisions to be taken,and to keep Italy and Japan, who, though not occupying Powers, are represented on the Ambassadors&apos;  Conference, fully informed.1yil) In any statement on the subject in Parliament, it would be sufficient to make astatement as in (i.) above.The Cabinet approved the policy proposed by the Secretary of ..State for Foreign Affairs, and left all details as to its execu-tion in his hands.

The Committee further proposed thatrecommendations should be invited with regard to such schemes from the Imperial Economic Committee, withinthe scope of whose reference they would naturallyfall.    The basis of calculation of the advantage tothe Dominions under the duties originally agreedwould be the equivalent cost to the Treasury ofOubstiWoing for the duty on foreign imports an equivalent bounty on Empire imports.    In this wayit was thought that Empire producers would get fully as effective help as would have been given by theduties theieselves, and that the help would he extendedover a wider range of products.The Prime Minister undertook, in announcing the above policy in Parliament to make clear thathome producers should have the first place in thehome market, and that the preference to the dominions would relate to that part of the home market which
oould not be supplied by the home producer, that isto say, it would be at the expense of foreigncountries and not of the home producer.-14-
