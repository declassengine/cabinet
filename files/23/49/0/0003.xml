(TJid.s^Document is^ jkhe^Pr ojperty^of; His Britannic&quot;setting tfe^rC;^:&apos;s&quot; Trove rnment rT&quot;&quot;&quot;-secret cabinet 61 (24)CONCLUSIONS of a Meeting of the Cabinet,held at 10, Downing Street, S*W.&apos;1S onTHURSDAY, NOVEMBER :20, 1924, at 4 p.m.SCOTTISH 1.-. The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsFISHERIES:.informed his colleagues that negotiations had commenced the Moray :Firth. with Norway with a view to a Treaty on the subject ofThe Negotia-       fishing and other matters.    Norway claimed that thetions with Norway. limit of territorial waters should be four miles.We claimed, and intended to insist on, the recognitionof the three-mile limit, but would have to recognise the &quot;appropriated waters&quot; in the fjords of Norway.The original instructions to the British delegatesauthorised them to discuss the question of trawlingin the Moray Firth.    This was prohibited to British trawlers, but we had no power to prohibit it to foreigners.    Before the War, Norwegian trawlers had&apos;fished in these waters, and although they were hotdoing do at the present time, there was nothing toprevent their resumption of the practice.    It had beendesired to protect the breeding-places of the fish inf. the Moray Firth.A consultation had taken place between.the various departments concerned in this questions and all except the Scottish Office had agreed that it was inexpedient
to raise the question in the course of the present negotiations.    Even if agreement were reached with Norway on this point, negotiations would have to be entered into with other Powers in order to effect theobject in view.    There was general agreement, thereforeby all the Departments excepting the Scottish Office,that a. better course would be to raiso the question at the International Council for the Exploration ofthe Sea3 with a view to protecting this breeding-ground as a common Interest of the world.The Cabinet were informed that the feeling inScotland was very strong on this question, which had existed for many years.    It was probably known thatthe question might be raised in the Norwegian negotia-tionss and the  subject was certain   to be raised inParliament.-After a short discussion, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the question of fishing in the moray Firth should not be raised inthe course of the Norwegian negotiations-tions.(b) That the first possible opportunity should be sought to raise the question at the International Council for the exploration of the Sea:(c) That , before this was done, the Britishcase should bo worked out in detail,in-order to ensure that.it had everyprospect of acceptance.
IGYPT.2o After a discussion in regax*d to the action to heBritishPolicy in..The Outrageagainst Sir-Lee Stack.(previous reference:Cabinet 59(24), Con-elusion 7o )taken in consequence of the attempted murder of Major-General Sir L.0-  Fitzmaurice Stack, Governor-General ofthe Sudan and Sirdar of the Egyptian Army, the cabinet agreed  (a) That the crime oalls for decisiveaction with a view to putting anend to the campaign of hatred whichhas been stimulated in Egypt by along series of attacks on the persons and &apos; authority of British officers aixiofficials in the Sudan, attacks whichthe public utterances of Zaghloulhave encouraged.(b) To approve the draft telegram to lord allenby, prepared by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, subject tocertain amendments which the Secretaryof State accepted.    This telegram toform the basis of a draft communication to the Egyptian Government to be pre-pared by &quot;Lord Allenby and submitted byhim to the Secretary of State , forapproval of the Cabinet, before commu-communication to the Egyptian Government:(o) That the Secretary of State shouldinquire of Lord Allenby what forecasthe would make - of the probable attitudeof the Egyptian Government;   whether he was satisfied of the sufficiency ofthe British forces available in Egyptfor dealing with all emergenci.es   and:?if not, what reinforcements, and ofwhat character, he considered to berequired:(d) That the Prime Minister should see thethree Chiefs of Staff the same evening,and ask them to consider and report tothe Cabinet as to the sufficiency ofthe forces in Egypt and the Sudan,together with such reinforcements as could rapidly be  sent there, to meet all possible developments of thesituation which might arise, includingthe contingency of a refusal by theEgyptian -Government to comply with thedemands to be presented by Lord Allenby.
RUSSIA. 3. The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Zinovieff     read to the Cabinet the amendment he had nade inLetter..  the draft reply to M. Rakovsky, which had beenGeneralPolicy discussed at the previous Meeting,towards.The amendment met with unanimousapproval.(previous reference: After a short discussion on the GovernmentIaCabinet 60(24). 0on-N policy towards Russia-, the Cabinet agreed  elusion 9. ;-(a) That the two replies toil. Rakovsky,already approved? should be sent: f? O &apos; forthwith:(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should send afurther note to M* Rakovsky (ther* , , text of which was read to the^fr^^fH Cabinet) notifying the SovietGovernment that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were unable to recommend the Treaties to Parliament or tosubmit them to the King for ratifi-demobilisation:(c) That the President *Jf the Board ofTrade and the Chancellor of theExchequer should enquire into theposition of the balances retained in the United Kingdom in accordancewith the terms of &quot;Article 10 ofthe Russian Trade Agreement, andshould ascertain whether. In theevent of the denunciation of thisAgreement by the Soviet Government,any action would be necessary toprevent the removal of thesebalances.
GERMANY&quot;,commercial treaty.(previous reference:Cabinet 60(24), Con-elusion 10 ).4. The attention of the Cabinet was called., as amatter of immediate urgency, to a Note by thePresident of the Board of Trade on the proposedCommercial Treaty with Germany (Paper C-P.-497 (24)).The only point on which the Cabinet was asked to takea decision was the German insistence that legislationshall be promoted by His Majesty&apos;s Government to sweepaway the particular disabilities affecting ex-enemy aliens and not other aliens, and the Cabinet were asked to consider more particularly the case of removing these disabilities in regard to ex-enemiesserving on British merchant ships..The Cabinet agreed  (a) That, for the reasons given in theMemorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade , the German request should be acceded to for the removalof the disabilities affecting ex-enemy aliens and not&apos; other aliens.(b)That the President of the Board of.Trade should take such steps as heshould deem desirable for ensuring that whenever, this undertaking ismade known to the public the reasonsfor the decision shall also be made public.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,November 21, 1924.
[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;3 Government, and should bereturned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.](E.10067/363A6).Cypher telegram to Lord Allenby   (Cairo)..   Foreign Office, 20th November 1924.   11.45 p.m.No. 217.Your telegrams Nob. 361 and 363 (of November 19th;attack on the Sirdar).1.   I agree with you that this crime calls fordecisive action.2. An apology and punishment of assailants are obviously necessary but payment of an indemnity seemsto me the least part of the reparation to be expected.It is only right and proper that the Egyptian governmentshould see to it that at least financially Sir Lee Stackshould not suffer from the brutal outrage of which hehas been the victim, and I hope that they v/ill show asufficient sense of decency to make suggestions in this sense without prompting on Your Lordship&apos;s part.   Thecrime is the logical outcome of the campaign of hatredwhich has been stimulated In Egypt by a long series of attacks on the persons and authority of British officersand officials in the Sudan, attacks which the public utterances of Zaghloul have encouraged. I cannot ignore the fact that whatever the intentions of his recentdeclarations they serve as an incitement to Egyptiansand rouse the passions which have now resulted, in thisbrutal&apos;attempt at murder, in the face of which his-aiesty&apos;s Government are forced to take immediate stepsto...
to protect their nationals and to assert their legitimatauthority, as my predecessor warned Zaghloul would in-inevitably he the case,3.   In addition to the two demands which are summarised in your telegram No.363 and which areconcrete examples of the steps which I have in view,it will he necessary to insist upon(a) Acquiescence in the conversion of the blackand Arab units of the Egyptian army into a Sudan defence force in the pay of and owing allegiance to the sudan government alOne.   This purely Sudan force to he underthe supreme command of an officer appointed by theGovernor-General who will issue the necessary corn-missions to Sudanese officers of the force and brevetsto British officers seconded for service with it.(b) Acquiescence in the removal from the Sudanof Egyptian officers at present serving with Sudaneseunits of the Egyptian army.(c) The recall to Egypt of the purely Egyptianunits of the Egyptian army now in the Sudan.(d) An undertaking to appoint as Governor-general in, accordance v/ith Article 3 of the 1899 agreement, theperson to be selected by His Majesty1s Government fortills post.(e) The appointment of an Egyptian member of thecommission to be set up by Your Lordship to examine thepossibility of extending, without detriment to Egypt,the 300,000 acre area to be irrigated by the Blue Niledam.
4. The above demands follow- the general lines suggested in your telegram No*352 (of November 14th)as amended by my telegram No.215 (of November 19th). as our object is completely to separate the military forcesof Egypt from those of the Sudan, there can be noquestion of a joint commander-in*-*chief as in the past.We shall be ready to consider later how far it is expedient to require Egypt to contribute to the costof the new Sudan defence force but it would clearly be inexpedient to make any concession on this point at themoment.   The commission of this crime cannot be allowedto have as its first result the relief of burdens nowborne by Egypt,5, Having regard to the serious nature of hisinjuries I fear that Sir Lee Stack cannot for a con-siderable time be fit to resume the ardous duties whichthe Govern or-General of the Sudan is likely to have to face, but in any case I feel that new arrangements are called for,6. The situation demands that a man of wideadministrative experience should take over,the dutiesof Governor-General in the Sudan without delay. As soonas my selection for this important post is made, theEgyptian government as indicated in 3 (d) will becalled upon to make the appointment in accordance withthe terms of the 1899 convention,7. In the meantime the War Office have beenasked to issue orders for another battalion withbrigade... -
brigade headquarters to proceed at once to the Sudanand for their place in Egypt to be taken by a battalion from Malta or elsewhere.8, Please prepare draft communication to theEgyptian government on lines indicated above and telegraph its text to me for consideration by HisMajesty&apos;s Government.Mien approved,   I propose to publish it here simultaneously with its presentation to the Egyptian government by Your Lordshipe
2.   Note from Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to M. Eakowsky in reply to the Soviet note of October 25th regarding the Zinoviev letter.FOREIGN OFFICE.November 21st, 1924,Sir,I have had under consideration your reply ofthe 25th October to the note which my predecessoraddressed to you with regard to the activities ofthe Communist International in this country,Z.   In the third paragraph of that reply youundertook to declare, apparently upon internalevidence alone and without allowing time for any reference to Moscow, that the letter from M. Zinovievwhich was the occasion of Mr, Ramsay MacDonald&apos;srepresentations was a gross forgery.   In support ofthis assertion you alleged that the CommunistInternational is never described in its own circularsas the &quot;Third Communist International&quot;, that M,Zinoviev never signs as &quot;President of the Presidiumof the Executive Committee of the Communist Interna-tional&quot; but always as &quot;President of the ExecutiveCommittee&quot;, and that the whole of the contents arefrom a Communist point of view a tissue of absurdities,3.   His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot accept theseassertions, which are disproved by reference to theofficial publications and daily press of the Union.
4.   But it is unnecessary to go into these details,Tor the information in the possession of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment leaves no doubt whatsoever in their mind of the authenticity of M, Zinoviev&apos;s letter, and HisMajesty&apos;s Government are therefore not prepared todiscuss the matter.5.   I must further observe that you would entirelymisapprehend the character of the representations madeto you by my predecessor if you supposed that theydealt with M. Zinoviev&apos;s letter only.    The activitiesof which His Majesty&apos;s Government complain are not confined to one particular letter, but, on the contrary,extend to a whole body of revolutionary propaganda ofwhich the letter is a fair specimen, and which is sometimes conducted in secret and sometimes, as yourightly remark, not concealed.    The pronouncements ofM. Zinoviev, which have been broadcast throughout theworld, are in themselves sufficient evidence of propaganda in which the Third International, with theknowledge and consent of the soviet Government.,perpetually indulges, and it is this system which inthe view of His Majesty&apos;s Government is inconsistent with the solemn undertakings given by your government.
6.     In his note of October 24th, Mr. ramsay macdonald observed that &quot;No one who understands theconstitution and the relationships of the CommunistInternational will doubt its intimate connectionand contact   with the Soviet Government&quot;.   he further observed that &quot;no Government would evertolerate an arrangement&apos; with a foreign government by which the latter is in formal diplomatic relations of a correct kind with it, whilst at thesame time a propagandist body organically connectedwith that foreign government encourages and evenorders subjects of the former to plot and planrevolutions for its overthrow&quot;.      This is true*and the Soviet Government would do well to weighcarefully the consequences of ignoring thispronouncement.I have the honour to be with high consideration.Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed) Austen Chamberlain,
3.    Letter from Mr. Gregory to, M, Rakovsky regarding a second Soviet Note dated October 27th,    The text ofthe Note appeared in the press here and in Moscow and formed the subject of semi-official correspondence between Mr. Gregory and M. Rakovsky which has nowbeen brought to a conclusion by Mr. Gregory&apos;s letter.Foreign Office.November 21st, 1924.Dear Monsieur Rakovsky,I have submitted to the Secretary of State your letter to me, marked come,-8553, of the 8th November.Mr. Chamberlain instructs me to reply that hehas caused the records left in this Office by his predecessor to be searched, and that your note ofthe 27th October on the subject of M. Zlnoviev&apos;despatch to the Central Committee of Great britain has not been found among them.    Mr. Chamberlain is,of course, familiar with the substance of this note,,which was published in Moscow, but he has no intention of departing from the decision communicatedto you by Mr. MacDonald and recorded in this Office,that the note in question was one which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment cannot consent to receive.Yours very sincerely,(Signed)     J. 33. GREGORY,
FOE PUBLICATION IN MORNING PAPERS OF 22nd .NOVEMBER.The following communications to the Soviet Charged&apos;Affaires were given out by the Foreign Office tonight.1;    Note from the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to M. Rakovsky regarding the Treatiseconcluded by the late Government with theU.S.S.R,Foreign Office,21st November, 1S24.Sir,His Majesty&apos;s Government have had under review the treaties negotiated by their predecessors with theGovernment of the U.S.S.R. and signed on August 8thlast.2.    I have the honour to inform you that afterdue deliberation His Majesty1 s Government find them-selves unable to recommend the treaties in question to the consideration of Parliament or to submit themto The King for His Majesty^ ratification,I have the honour to fee with high consideration,Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed)       AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN.
