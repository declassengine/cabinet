If the Committeedecide that the numbers originally proposed are not necessary for the manning of the Fleet, the saving resultingfrom this reduction should be used to diminish the potential liability to a supplementary Estimate;    If, on the otherhand, the Committee decide that a number in excess of 2,175 is   required, a supplementary Estimate will be introduced.fd) That a Cabinet Committee, to be composedof:*-a Cabinet Minister (in the Chair),The Financial Secretaries of:-The Treasury,The Admiralty,The War Office,The Air Ministry,should be appointed to consider:-

rI\ Appendix fpSECRET.JD.P. 96 (25).CABINET.[Circulated to the Cabinet by direction of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.]5 I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a draft despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador[at Washington regarding a new Naval Conference at Washington for the furtherlimiting of naval armaments and expenditure.I _jDraft Despatch to Sir E. Howard (Washington).(No.    .)Sir, Foreign- Office, February    , 1925.IN the course of my farewell conversation with Mr. Kellogg we touched, amongst: other great questions, on the prospects of further disarmament and the possibility ofj holding another conference at Washington to continue and develop the work of theconference of 1922.2. I need not remind your Excellency how gladly His Majesty&apos;s Government- accepted the invitation to that conference, nor need I recall their hearty andi immediate response to the general scheme proposed by Mr. Hughes. No Governmenti more readily accepted nor has any more loyally fulfilled the obligations thensubscribed by the most important naval Powers. The decisions of that conference i have done much to restrict the growth of a fresh international competition in navali armaments and to relieve the burden of taxation which would otherwise have fallen toi be borne by the taxpayers of our respective countries.3. I have now to request that your Excellency will formally repeat to thei Secretary of State the assurance which in conversation I have given to theI Ambassador, that His Majesty&apos;s Government would cordially welcome the summoningI of a new conference to be held at Washington, and would most readily join with theI other great naval Powers in further limiting naval armaments and expenditure.4. It will be for the convening Power to consider in what directions progressmay be most readily achieved. It is obvious that there are geographical and other reasons for which the ratio already agreed on for capital ships could not be applied\ to the case of cruisers. But His Majesty&apos;s Government have no doubt that, with theI co-operation of the other naval Powers, further substantial progress could be made.I Tn particular and without excluding other matters, it would seem to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that discussion on all or any of the following points might well lead to1 an agreement which would sensibly relieve the burdens on our national finances andI lessen the danger of war : (1.) Dimensions and armament of cruisers.(2.) Armament of aircraft carriers.(3.) Total number, dimensions and armament of submarines.(4.) Dimensions and armament of destroyers.2812687   [12708]   [12712a]
