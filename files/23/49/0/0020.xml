S E C B S T -(TliiSi Doomnent is the Property of His britannic ^esty^ si Government. 1CABINET 11 (25).on conclusions of a Meeting of the Cabinet, heldin the Prime Minister&apos;room, House of commons I FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1925, at 11-30 a.m.Ive to viceroy.8V10USierenoe:linet 25I), Con-ision 12.)1. The Secretary of State for India informed theCabinet that after consultation with the Prime minister he had decided., acting in Council, to. authorise theViceroy of India to come to England on leave forthree months,under the provisions of the Leave of high Officials In India Act, next April, unless someuntoward Incident occurred in India, in which caseLord Reading had stated that he would not quit hispost.    In extending this invitation to the Viceroythe Secretary of State had borne in mind the exceptionalstrain to which Lord Healing had been subjected duringthe last few years.    It would be announced that thereason for the visit was for purposes of consultationwith himself and other Ministers, which he was sure   fthe Cabinet would feel was highly desirable.The Cabinet welcomed the aotiontaken by the Seoretary of State.
portedsignationLo&apos;rdlenb.y.2.&quot; The attention of the Cabinet was called to astatement in a morning newspaper that Field-MarshalLord Allenby was about to resign the post of HighCommissioner in egypt.-The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed his colleagues that he was in correspondence with Lord Allenby on the subject and was considering,having regard to previous correspondence, the form inwhich the submission should be made to the King, aswell as of the public announcement.
3. The Secretary of State- for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that the German &quot;Government had now communicated to the Belgian and Italian governments the Memorandum which they had previously communicatedfirst to the British Government and later to the FrenchGovernment, containing proposals for pacts of guarantee to the German frontiers.   Mr Austen Chamberlain addedthat he had had an important conversation with theBelgian Ambassador on the subject, the record of whichwould be circulated to the Cabinet.
JTIOALBILL.4. After hearing from the Secretary of State forIndia, as Chairman of the Cabinet Committee on theevious-ferenoe:ilnst 9Political Levies Bill, a verbal report in regard tothe proceedings andrecommendations of his Committeand after a full discussion of the various alternativesthe Cabinet agreedThat the Prime Minister should Interveneat an early stage In the Debate on thePolitical Levies (Private Member&apos;s) Bill,and should impress on the House that oneof the main principles of the Government&apos;policy Is to&quot;do everything possible topromote peace in the industrial world.While making clear that the Governmentbelieved the present system of levyingcontributions from Trades Unions for political purposes was unjust and wrong,  &apos;they were not prepared at the presenttime, to bring their great majority tobear in support of a &quot;measure which must1 inevitably have the effect of arousingacute controversy and- embittering rela-tions among those who alone were&quot;in aposition to bring about the desiredpacification.   He should franklyrecognise that this called for a oon-siderable sacrifice on the part ofsupporters of the Government in Parlia-ment, but he should appeal to them toaccept this sacrifice for the good ofthe country.. He should, however, make clear that if this gesture did not meet with a favourable response from theOpposition, the Government would not hesitate to take action on their own responsibility.The question of whether this announcement should be communicated privately beforehandto the Government1s supporters, or whetherit should be announced without warning,-..was left to the Prime Minister, to decide inconsultation with colleagues in the Houseof Commons.2, Whitehall Gardens,Pebruary 27, 1925.
