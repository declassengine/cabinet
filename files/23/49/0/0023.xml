The Cabinet resumed the discussion on theGenera Protocol and Security which had been begunthe same morning.At the outset of the morning Meeting it became evident that the tentative and provisional policy set forth as a basis for further consideration inthe rough draft formula on security (which had been circulated as an Appendix to the Draft Conclusionsof the previous Meeting as representing the general trend of the cabinet view) did not, on further examination, commend itself to the Cabinet.     Inparticular, exception was taken to the provision that, as part of a quadrilateral agreement, Prance,Germany, Great Britain and Belgium (perhaps with theaccord of Italy) should guarantee each other?afrontiers in the West of Europe.     This phrase, itwas felt, would be generally interpreted assignifying the intention of the British nation to guarantee, if necessary and in the last resort evanby force of arms, the present frontiers not only of france  and Belgium against aggression by Germanysbut also of Germany against aggression by Prance.So extensive a commitment, it was represented^ wentconsiderably beyond what public opinion whether athome or in the Dominions would be willing to accept,
at any rate at this stage of the negotiations, andthe Cabinet were not prepared to sanction any step in that direction which it might afterwards be diffi-cult to retrace.After further full discussion both on thequestion of security and on the draft statement onthe Geneva Protocol, prepared by the Earl of Balfour,the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the&apos; Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should be authorisedto announce to the Council of theLeague the decision of the BritishGovernment not to adhere to the geneva Protocol:(b) To approve the Sari of Balfour1s. draft (C.I.D. Paper 589-B) , subjeotto the following amendments:-Section IIIy 4th paragraph: Delete fromthe words h what&apos;was easy hasbecome difficult&quot; down to thewords &quot;but easy to explain&quot;,at the beginning of the 5thparagraph:Section III, 6th paragraph: Delete the.whole paragraph, from the firstwords j &quot;It&quot;seems indeed&quot; downto the last words, &quot;as theUnited States of America&quot;.(KjOTE: The above sections (Appendix l)which deal in detail with thedifficulties in the applicationof the economic sanctions ofthe Covenant, were omitted asunsuitable for the circumstances in which this statement will beissued, but their general purportwas accepted by the Gabinet, andthey were reserved with a viewto their possible announcement on s ome more opportune occasion.)Section V: Delete all that follows thethird paragraph and substitute the Earl of balfour&apos;s revisedparagraphs (in which certain amendments of detail were made).(NOTE: A revised version of the wholeMemorandum as finally approvedwill be circulated and attached as Appendix II to these Con-clusions.)(c) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be authorised to use thestatement referred to in &apos;b) in such
manner as lie might feel desirable,e.g, , whether as a statement to be read at the Council, or as a letterto be addressed to the Secretary-General-      of the League of Nations]^(d) That on the question of security theSecretary of-State for Foreign Affairs,in his conversations - with M. Herriot,should be authorised to take as his general line^ihe following statement,with whioh he/summed up the Cabinet&apos;discussion on this subject:-He would like to say to M. Herriotthat he attached the highest import-ance to Germany^s overture for aquadrilateral; agreement of mutualsecurity.   He would propose to saythat at first, when the overturehad been made to the British Govern-ment alone, he had felt some suspicion,but that these suspicions had been removed when, at a later date, theproposals had been communicated first to the French and then to the belgian and. Italian Governments.   He would add that these overtures seemed tooffer the best chance for- givingsecurity to France and peace to &quot;theworld.    To turn it down would be tothrust Germany into the hands ofRussia.       He hoped, therefore, very:much that the proposals would be most carefully considered.    He would want to know whether the French shared the British Governments view in thismatter and what their views were as to how to handle it,    The British Govern-ment, on their part, would consult theDominions, who obviously must be con-suited in such a matter, and the:/ wouldalso do their utmost to contribute tothe successful development of thishopeful episode and to secure the resultrequired for the peace of Europe.    Hewould tell ]:/. Herriot about the stateof publio opinion in this country, but would express a strong hope of dealingsuccessfully with it if Germany were included in tho proposed arrangement,though he could not offer any suchhopes without Germany.        a      &amp;       H      J6       face      3 He asked if he might pledge the BritishGovernment to do its best to make possible such a mutual agreement withGermany as had been suggested.    He wouldlike to say that if the participation of His Majesty1s Government was desired,though he was not in a position to agreeto any particular formula or to pledgethe Dominions, his colleagues had authorised him to say that they would
use their best endeavours tosecure that such a projeotshould not fail for want ofBritish concurrence:(a) That the Secretary of State for theColonies , in accordance with theundertaking given in an earliertelegram, should send to theDominions the full text of thestatement referred to above in (b) ,notifying them at the same time thatthe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs had been given a free handas to the manner In which he shouldmake use of it.   He should also make such communication to the Dominionsas he might deem advisable in regardto the present position of thesecurity question:(f) To place on record an expression oftheir thanks to the Barl of Balfourfor the assistance he had given, andtheir recognition of the patience withwhich the Foreign Secretary had con-ducted the very difficult and prolongeddiscussions on these questions.

The Cabinet approved the proposal In a Memo-randum by the Minister of Health (Paper 0.P.-129 (25))on the subject of Rent Restrictions which may be summed up as follows that any proposal to introduce amending legislation will stir up controversy,and that in the raw Bili, of which notice has already been given, pro-vision should be made for the prolong-ation of the existing provisions ofthe Rent Restriction Act, In the firstinstance for two years only (which hasalready been stated to be the minimum period of extension contemplated bythe Government), but that the Billshould be so drafted as to permit ofa further continuance under the expiring laws Continuance Acts if this should prove to be necessary.The Cabinet were reminded that an Inquiryconnected with the subject of rent restriction was taking place in  &quot;cotland as the result of recentdifficulties in the Clyde district.    It was anticipatedthat any legislation that might be necessary as theresult of this Inquiry would probably be included ina separate measure from the Rent Restriction Bill.The following should be added at end ofConclusionThe Minister of Health asked that .attention should be drawn to thefact that in the Bill as draftedthe existing provisions are pro-longed, for 2g years to avoid thepossibility of having to includethe Act in an Expiring Laws Con-tinuance Bill nearly a year before it actually expires, as might benece ssa.r,y if the prolongationwere for two- years only.\

The Cabinet approved the recommendation of theCabinet Committee contained in a Memorandum by theMinister of Health (Paper CP.-132 (25)) that the minister of Labour be authorised to set up a Court of inquiry, as already proposed, which should result inelucidating the actual facts of the position and making clear the nature of the operations involved.The Cabinet took note that, as a result, itmight be necessary to ask Parliament to modify theterms of the Pair Wages clause.-8-

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Labour in regard to the attitude he proposedto take in the Debate on a Vote on Account on March 5th,when an attack was expected on the new contributionrequirement for Unemployment Benefit, and generally on the alleged tightening up of Unemployment Insuranceadministration (Paper CP.-119 (25)).In his Memorandum the Minister of Labour drew attention to the fact that the Unemployment InsuranceAct, 1924, brings fully into force on October 1st nextthe requirement that 30 contributions must have been paid since the beginning; of the last insurance yearbut one, a requirement which, if applied now, woulddisqualify some 250,000 persons.    The Minister ofLabour further expressed doubt as to whether the considerable gap between the 10,000 and 15,000 nowdisqualified and the 250,000 who would be disqualifiedby the full requirement could be fully bridged by october 1st, and pointed out that, if it could not bebridged, legislation would be necessary this session to continue the suspensory power with modifications to suit the circumstances.The Cabinet approved the line which theMinister of Labour proposed to take Inthe forthcoming Debate on March 5th,namely, to draw attention to the abovefacts5 to emphasize that the contribu-tion requirement is a vital part oflast year&apos;s Act;   that it must be attained, albeit by instalments, as tothe size and frequency of which regardwould have to be paid to the state ofindustry and employment for the timebeing-.

[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.&apos;]      332Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1925.SECRET.CP. i36 (25).Copy No.1CABINET.PROTOCOL FOR THE PACIFIC SETTLEMENT OF international disputes.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government have given the most anxious consideration to the protocol which was provisionally accepted last October by the Assembly of theLeague of Nations, and submitted by its Council to the various States Membersof the League. It is unnecessary to lay stress upon the sympathy felt throughoutthe British Empire with any effort to improve the international machinery for maintaining the peace of the world. Arbitration, disarmament and security arethe main themes of. the Protocol, and on all these great subjects the British Empirehas shown, by deeds as well as words, that it is in the fullest accord with the idealswhich have animated the Fifth Assembly of the League. Successive administrationsin Great Britain, with the full approval of the self-governing Dominions, have notonly favoured arbitration in theory; they have largely availed themselves of it inpractice. They have not contented themselves with preaching disarmament; theyhave disarmed to the limits of national safety. They have taken their full share in creating and supporting the League of Nations and the Court of InternationalJustice; while the immense sacrifices they have been content to make in the causeof general security are matters of recent history.If, therefore, His Majes^s^p^esgnt advisers, after discussing the subject withthe self-governing Dominions^see. insuperable objections to signing and ratifying the Protocol in its present shape, this is not because they feel themselves out ofharmony with the purpose which it was intended to serve, or are opposed inprinciple to schemes for clarifying the meaning of the Covenant or strengtheningits provisions. Amendment and interpretation may in themselves be desirable;but His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot believe that the Protocol as it standsprovides the most suitable method of attempting that task.The declared object of the Protocol is to facilitate disarmament, and it proposesto attain this most desirable end (1) by closing certain gaps in the scheme originallylaid down in the Covenant for peaceably settling international disputes, and(2) by sharpeoing the &quot;sanctions,&quot; especially the economic sanctions, by which,under the existing system, aggression is to be discouraged and aggressors coerced.These two portions of the scheme are intimately connected, and it may be desirableon the present occasion to consider them together.It was, of course, well known to the framers of the Covenant that internationaldifferences might conceivably take a form for which their peace-preservingmachinery provided no specific remedy; nor could they have doubted that this defect,if defect it was, could in theory be cured by insisting that every dispute should, atsome stage or other, be submitted to arbitration. If, therefore, they rejected thissimple method of obtaining systematic completeness, it was presumably becauseDraft Communication to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations.(As approved by the Cabinet, March 4, 1925.)Foreign Office,March     , 1925.II.[12792]
they felt, as so many States Members of the League have felt since, that theobjections to universal and compulsory arbitration might easily outweigh itstheoretical advantages So far as the Court of International Justice is concerned,this view was taken in 1920 by the British Delegation, while the British delegation of 1924 made a reservation in the same connection which, so far as Great britain is concerned, greatly limits the universal application of the compulsory principle.Into this branch of the controversy, however. His Majesty&apos;s Government do not now propose to enter. It suffices to say that, so far from their objections tocompuisory arbitration being diminished by the provisions of the Protocol, theyhave rather been increased, owing to the weakening of those reservations in clause 15 of the Covenant, which were designed to prevent any interference by theLeague in matters of domestic jurisdiction.His Majesty&apos;s Government are now more immediately concerned to enquire howfar the change in the Covenant affected by the Protocol is likely to increase the responsibilities already undertaken by the States Members of the League. On this there may conceivably be two opinions. Some have held that, although in the language of the First Committee (p. 7) &quot;there are numerous fissures in the wallof protection erected by the Covenant round the peace of the world,&quot; there is in factbut little danger that through these &quot; fissures &quot; any serious assaults will be attempted.The changes made by the Protocol are, in their judgment, formal rather thansubstantial; they aim at theoretical completeness rather than practical effect. Onthis view no material addition is made to responsibilities already incurred underthe Covenant, nor (it must be added) is anything of importance accomplished in thecause of Peace and Disarmament.But this (it need hardly be said) is not the view of the framers of the Protocol.They regard themselves as the authors of a &quot;new system&quot; (p. 6) through which alone can be realised &quot; the great ideal to which humanity aspires &quot; (p. 7). The lastthing they contemplate is the possibility that their proposals will leave things verymuch as they stand under the Covenant. And in this His Majesty&apos;s- Government are entirely of their opinion. How, indeed, can it be otherwise? Fresh classes of disputes are to be decided by the League; fresh possibilities of defying its decisions are thereby created; fresh occasions for the application of coercive measures followas a matter of course; and it is therefore not surprising that, quite apart from theproblem of disarmament, the question of &quot; sanctions &quot; should be treated at length in the clauses of the Protocol.III.It seems necessary to preface the comments called for by this part of the new scheme by recalling certain historic facts which, though very relevant to the subject,are never referred to in the documents by which the Protocol is justified and explained.As all the world is aware, the League of Nations, in its present shape, is not theLeague designed by the framers of the Covenant. They no doubt contemplated, and,as far as they could, provided against, the difficulties that might arise from thenon-inclusion of a certain number of States within the circle of Leaguemembership. But they never supposed that among these States would be found so many of the most powerful nations in the world, least of all did they foresee thatone of them would be the United States of America.It is no doubt true that there are many points of view from which theseunfortunate facts have not proved to be of vital importance. The work of the Leaguegoes on, beneficent and full of promise. Though the United States remains infriendly aloofness, individual Americans have freely helped both by sympathy and service, while the generosity of the American public has greatly aided some causesin which the League is deeply interested. Could, therefore, attention be confined to the present and the past, it might be said with truth that the problems which even a weakened League has had to face have never overstrained its machinery.The hope may be justified that this good fortune will continue. But surelyit is most unwise to add to the liabilities already incurred without taking stock of the degree to which the machinery of the Covenant has been already weakened by the non-membership of certain great States. For in truth the change, especially as regardsthe &quot;economic sanctions,&quot; amounts to a transformation. The &quot;economic sanction,&quot; ifsimultaneously directed by all the world against a State which is not itselfeconomically self-sufficing, would be a weapon of incalculable power. This, or some-thing not very different from this, was the weapon originally devised by the authorsof the Covenant.   To them it appeared to be not only bloodless, but cheap, effective
and easy to use, in the most improbable event of its use being necessary. But all thisie changed by the mere existence of powerful economic communities outside the limits,of the League. It might force trade into unaccustomed channels, but it could hardlystop it; and^ though the offending State would no doubt suffer, there is no presumption-tion that it would be crushed, or even that it would suffer most. roWere this the occasion for entering into a detailed discussion of the subsidiaryprovisions of the Protocol, it would be necessary to dwell at length on all those which,in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, are open to serious objection. Butfor the purposes of the present communication the following observations may suffice.Articles 7 and 8 of the Protocol are designed for the purpose of preventing aState which has a difference with a neighbour from making any preparations for war between the moment when a dispute arises and the moment when proceedings for apacific settlement have been concluded. The intentions of these provisions are mostlaudable. But its framers have not perhaps sufficiently considered that it mayembarrass the victim of aggression even more than the aggressor. The aggressor is at liberty to select his own date for picking a quarrel. Until that date arrives he maydistribute his armies as he pleases provided only that he neither mobilises them nGradds to them. When the distribution is as favourable to his designs as he can hope to make them, he starts the dispute. Immediately the military position becomestemporarily unalterable. His troops, which are more or less in the right position for attack, may (indeed must) be kept there till he wants to use them. The troops, on theother hand, of his prospective victim are (by supposition) in the wrong position for defence. But there they must be kept, or the victim may find himself charged with a breach of the Protocol. Is this a tolerable situation? Is it one that could possiblysurvive the day of trial ?It may be replied that if the aggressor attempts to concentrate troops for attackbefore the dispute arises, means may be found to stop him. Grant that such meansexist, which is extremely doubtful, how does the Protocol deal with the case where thepeace distribution of the troops belonging to the aggressor is normally more suitablefor attack than the peace distribution of the troops belonging to its opponents are suitable for defence ? If a dispute were to arise, would the defender be counted as an aggressor solely because he endeavoured to redress this accidental inequality ?- These are some of the difficulties suggested by Articles 7 and 8 of the Protocol as these affect forces on land. But these articles raise even more embarrassing problemswhen applied to the case of forces at sea. The whole value of a fleet depends on itsmobility. Its distribution is in all probability quite different in time of peace from what it would be. under threat of war. To suggest that directly a dispute arises,which in any way concerns a maritime power, its ships are to remain immovablyfixed on the stations where the chance conveniences of peace may happen to have placed them, is asking the threatened State to make a surrender of its inalienableright of self-defence, to which it is never likely to submit.It may be desirable to add that, besides the obvious objections to those clausesalready indicated, their great obscurity, and the inherent impossibility ofdistinguishing, in any paper definition, military movements genuinely intended for defence, and only for defence, from movements with some ulterior aggressivepurpose, must always make them a danger to the unwary rather than a protection to the innocent.   They could never be accepted as they stand.There is one other clause in the Protocol Which cannot be passed over in completesilence, namely, clause 15.This contains two provisions. By the first, the aggressor State is required topay all the costs of the war for which it is responsible, and full reparation for alldamages, public or private, which the war has caused. By the second, it is protectedfrom any alteration of its frontiers and all interference with its internal affairs.With the sentiments which have dictated these two provisions there will be general sympathy. His Majesty&apos;s Government, at all events, have no desire to relieve the aggressor of the duty of repairing to the utmost of his ability the damages forwhich he is responsible;&apos;they hold strongly to the view that frontiers are neither tobe lightly made nor lightly violated; and they, of course, accept the broad principlethat sovereign States should be left to manage their own affairs. But they cannotthink it wise to embody these generalities in dogmas of inflexible rigidity, designedto. control the actions of the League in all circumstances and for all time. In thesternest codes of law mitigating circumstances are allowed to modify the judgmentsof the courts; and His Majesty&apos;s Government fail to-see why the League of nations should deliberately deprive itself of a discretion Avhich all other tribunals are free to exercise.T12792J 13 2
Moreover, there is a certain want of harmony between the two provisions of theArticle, which in rare and extreme cases (and it is for rare and extreme cases, among others, that we are asked to legislate) might well shock the consciences of the world.These cases cannot, indeed, be foreseen, but they may be imagined. Is it impossible(for example) that in a war arising out of some very complicated situation, involvingperhaps a State not a member of the League, the guilt of - the combatants might be fairly matched, though only one of them was technically the aggressor ? In such circumstances, would the League feel no misgivings when they found themselvescompelled to throw all the cost of the war upon one party and none at all upon theother ? Would not the universal verdict be that, under the first half of Clause 15, the aggressor had in this case been hardly treated ?But now consider the second half of Clause 15. This protects the aggressor,whatever his misdeeds, from losing anything under any circumstances but money orthe equivalent of money. Is this quite satisfactory ? The aggression may have beenutterly unprovoked; it may have been barbarously conducted; it may be the work ofa corrupt and tyrannical administration; and it may be the inevitable result of cruelmis-government on the aggressor&apos;s side.of an ill-drawn frontier. Are we to lay it down for all time that, in such a case, the League shall do nothing to prevent a repetition of the offence, but ask for money ? This may, indeed, be all that is possible.But would it not be wise to let the League itself resolve this problem, if unhappilythe occasion should ever arise 1There is one general reflection which His Majesty&apos;s Government venture to add to the specific criticisms they have made in the preceding paragraphs. The Protocolpurports to be little more than a completion of the work begun but not perfectedby the authors of the Covenant. But surely this is a very inadequate description ofits effects. The additions which it makes to the original document do somethingquite different from merely clarifying obscurities and filling in omissions. Theydestroy its balance and alter its spirit. The fresh emphasis laid upon sanctions;the new occasions discovered for their employment; the elaboration of militaryprocedure, insensibly suggest the idea that the vital business of the League is not so much to promote friendly co-operation and reasoned harmony in the management of international affairs, as to preserve peace by organising war, and (it may be) war on the largest scale. Now it is unhappily true that circumstances may be easilyimagined in which war, conducted by members of the League, and with its collectiveassistance and approval, will become a tragic necessity. But such catastrophiesbelong to the pathology of international life, not to its normal condition. It is notwholesome for the ordinary man to be always brooding over the possibility of somesevere surgical operation; nor is it wise for societies to pursue a similar course. Itis more likely to hasten the dreaded consummation than to hinder it. And it certainlyseems to His Majesty&apos;s Government that anything which fosters the idea that themain business of the League is with war rather than with peace, is likely to weakenit in its fundamental task of diminishing the causes of war, without making it inevery respect a satisfactory instrument for organising great military operations should the necessity for them be forced upon the world.IV.It may perhaps be urged that these objections to the Protocol, whatever be their value, are far outweighed by the blessings of the disarmament which would immediately follow its acceptance. But why should disarmament immediatelyfollow its acceptance? Why should the new scheme succeed when the old scheme has so lamentably failed? It no doubt claims to have closed some &quot;fissures in the wall of protection erected by the Covenant round the peace of the World.&quot; But itis not the possibility of an attack through these (alleged) weak places in the Covenantwhich haunts the imagination of those who hesitate to disarm. They do not doubtthat the Covenant, if kept, would be sufficient to protect them, at least from attack by those who have signed it. What they doubt is whether, when it comes to the point,the Covenant will be kept. Either some faithless member of the League will breakits pledges, or some predatory nation outside the League will brush Covenant andProtocol ruthlessly aside, defying all the sanctions by which they are protected.Brute force is what they fear, and only brute force enlisted in their defence can (asthey believe) give them the security of which they feel the need.His Majesty&apos;s Government fail altogether to see how this situation is betteredhy the Protocol. Is it to be&apos;supposed that the &quot; security&quot; promised by the new system will be so complete that no armaments capable of being used or improvised for
offensive purposes will remain in being ? If not, is the balance of power betweenthe States who desire peace and those who are plotting war to be adjusted in favourof the former ? If so, on what principle ? If not, then how are we advanced ? Howwill the unscrupulous aggressors be relatively weakened ? How will their potentialvictims be rendered more capable of defence ?And if the particular case of aggressors who are outside the League beconsidered, is not the weakness of the Protocol even more manifest ? the aggressors within the League are traitors in the sight of all mankind.Their moral position in the face of any opposition within their ownborders will be immensely weakened, while in neutral countries they will find none to plead their cause. However low the practical importance of moral considerations such as these may be rated, the eagerness of competingpropaganda in times of international crisis may convince the most cynicalthat a good cause counts at least for something. If so, aggressors outsidethe League will have a smaller load of infamy to carry than aggressors within it,and will be by so much the more formidable. How does the Protocol deal with them ?It requires them to treat the situation as if they were members of the League, toaccept its methods and conform to its decisions. If they refuse they are counted asaggressors, they become the common enemy, and every signatory State is bound togo to war with them. They may be in the right and have nothing to fear fromimpartial judges. Yet national pride; in some cases perhaps the sense of power;dislike of compulsory arbitration; distrust of the League (to which presumablythey have already refused to belong) -all these motives, or any of them, may hardentheir objections to outside interference. If so, the Protocol, designed to ensureuniversal peace, may only extend the area of war a possibility which, if realised,will not improve the chances of general disarmament.It may perhaps be replied that, while every scheme of sanctions is open to-criticism, some scheme of sanctions is certainly necessary. Without it a League ofNations would be as insecure as a civilised society without magistrates and police.International engagements which cannot be internationally enforced are little betterthan a sham. Those, therefore, who object to the plan proposed in the Protocolare bound to suggest a better.To this challenge His Majesty&apos;s Government might be content to reply that asbetween the Covenant unamended and the Covenant amended by the Protocol theyhave already given reasons for preferring the former. But they are unwilling to conclude their argument on a purely critical note; and though they cannot believethat &quot;security&quot; can be reached by the route so carefully explored by the first and third Committees of the League in 1924, they are willing to consider whether someapproach to it may not be made from the side unsuccessfully attempted in 1923.They do not agree indeed that without &apos;&apos; sanctions &apos;&apos; the League is powerless andtreaties no better than waste paper. Doctrines like these seem to them not onlymischievous, but self-contradictory. Every &quot;sanction&quot; referred to either in theCovenant or the Protocol depends on treaties; and if no treaties are of value, allsanctions must be worthless. Do what we will, we have no choice but, in the last resort, to depend upon the plighted word.But this, it must be admitted, does not settle the question whether the sanctionscontemplated by the Covenant cannot in certain cases and for certain purposes be supplemented with advantage to the general scheme of the Covenant itself. that scheme may no doubt be trusted in ordinary cases to work smoothly and effectively.The mere threat to employ sanctions will commonly suffice. And if, unfortunately, itdoes not, their effect, when put into operation, wili doubtless be speedy and conclusive.But it is easy to imagine extreme cases, about which we dare not speak with the sameassurance; and it is precisely the possibility of these extreme cases, remote though,that possibility may be, which fosters international suspicion, makes Governmentshesitate to disarm and keeps the world on edge.His Majesty&apos;s Government do not share these alarms, but they recognise theirserious effect, and believe them to be the main obstacles to the complete recovery of ourshaken civilisation from the disasters of war. How are they to be allayed ?f tvT ^irSt expectation^ent tnat naturally suggests itself is to strengthen the provisionso the Covenant. If the Covenant, as it stands, does not supply an adequatemachinery for preserving peace in all conceivable cases, why not alter it till it does ?
The futility of this plan is, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentabundantly proved by the Protocol. For whatever else its proposals give us, they donot give us security. They multiply offences, but do nothing to strengthen remediesThey increase the responsibilities undertaken by individual members of the Leaguebut do nothing to readjust their burden.What expedient remains? How is security, and, above, all, the feeling of security, to be attained ? In answering this question it is necessary to keep in mind the characteristics of the &quot; extreme cases,&quot; to which reference has already been madeThe &quot;Brooding fears that keep huge armaments in being have little relation to theordinary misunderstandings inseparable from international (as from social) life misunderstandings with which the League is so admirably fitted to deal. Theyspring from deep-lying causes of hostility, which for historic or other reasons dividegreat and powerful States. These fears may be groundless; but if they exist theycannot be effectually laid by even the most perfect method of dealing with particulardisputes by the machinery of enquiry and arbitration. For what is feared in suetcases is not injustice but war war deliberately undertaken for purposes of conquestor revenge. And, if so, can there be a better way of allaying fears like these, thanby adopting some scheme which should prove to all the world that such a war would fail ?Since the general provisions of the Covenant cannot be stiffened with advantage and since the &apos;&apos; extreme cases&apos;&apos; with which the League may have to deal willprobably affect certain nations or groups of nations more nearly than others,His Majesty&apos;s Government conclude that the best way of dealing with the situationis, with the co-operation of the League, to supplement the Covenant by makingspecial arrangements in order to meet special needs. That these arrangements shouldbe purely defensive in character, that they should be framed in the spirit of theCovenant, working in close harmony with the League and under its guidance, ismanifest. And in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government these objects can best be attained by knitting together the nations most immediately concerned, and whosedifferences might lead to a renewal of strife by means of treaties framed with the sole object of maintaining, as between themselves, an unbroken peace. Within itslimits no quicker remedy for our present ills can easily be found, nor any surersafeguard against future calanMtifis.
