APPENDIX.ROUGH DRAFT FORMULA ON SECURITY.His Majesty1s Government do not feel able toenter into a dual Paot with. France with or withoutBelgium.    The question of a quadrilateral agreementbetween France, Germany, Great Britain, belgium and, if possible, with the accord of Italy, for mutual securityfand for guaranteeing each other&apos;sfrontiers in the West of Europ^, stands on a different footing and might become a great assurance to thepeace of Europe and lead to a rapid reduction ofarmaments.   His Majesty1s Government have, of course,in these matters to carry with them the assent, or atleast the good will, of the various self-governingDominions of the British Empire.    If the FrenchGovernment share the views of His Majesty1 s Governmentand will regulate their action towards Germanyaccordingly, His Majesty1s Government will, fortheir part, begin the necessary discussions with theDominions, and in all their policy will endeavour tofurther the common cause.
