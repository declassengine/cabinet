THE ? IN THE NEAR EAST.

The Mudania Conference.

M. Venizelos&apos; attitude.

1. With reference to Cabinet 55(22), the present meeting had been summoned in the expectation that news would have been received from ? in regard to the negotiations, and that important decisions might have to be taken.

The Prime Minister regretted the absence of the Lord President of the Council (who was not due in London from Geneva until 7.0 p.m.), the Lord Chancellor the Minister of Labour, and the Secretary for Scotland. Messages had been received from the last three explaining that important engagements had necessitated their absence.

Mr. Fisher said that, when he left Geneva a day or two before, Lord Balfour had been in accord. with the Cabinet&apos;s policy so far as he knew it, but he was necessarily somewhat imperfectly informed.

Early in the meeting, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read telegram No.512 from Sir Horace Rumbold, which had come into his hands immediately before the meeting, and which contained some details of the difficulties attending the Mudania Conference. (Appendix 1).

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs then gave the Cabinet a full account of various conversations with M. Venizelos. First there was the interview which the Cabinet had asked the Secretary of State for War himself to have with M. Venizelos. Lord Curzon&apos;s account of this corresponded to the account contained in Paper No. C.P.4262, which has already....
already been circulated to the Cabinet.     Secondly, he described an interview which M. Venizelos had had the same morning with Sir Eyre Crowe, the Permanent Under-Seeret&amp;ryat the Foreign Office, an account of which is contained inthe Memorandum attached to these Minutes (Appendix II),Lord Curs on explained that after the first interviewmentioned above, there was reason to believe that while M,Venizelos, as an experienced statesman, fully recognisedthat at the Peace Conference the Greeks would have to give up Eastern Thrace, nevertheless, he had thought it imposs-ible that the Greeks wuld agree to allow the immediateoccupation of Eastern Thrace, before the Conference, by theTurks *     This, in M. TeniseloB1 view, would not only jeo-pardise the lives of the Greek inhabitants, but by placingtheir most coveted objective in the hands of the Turksbefore the Conference, it would deprive the Greeks end theAllies of all power of &quot;bargaining in regard to the other claims which the Turks were likely to put forward, such as reparations, the surrender of the Greek fleet, etc.     M*Vonizelos had apparently even contemplated, that Greece oughtto fight rather than submit to this*     After the firstinterview, however, M. Venizelos had consulted all shades of public opinion in Great Britain, including the american ambassador, who had reported the results of his conversationto Lord Curzon.     As the result, M. Vonizelos had taken uprather a different attitude in his interview with Sir EyreCrowe, and had advised the Government at Athens that theyshould accept the immediate withdrawal of their army behind the Liar it za on condition that the Greek administration shouldnot immediately be replaced by the Turks.   His view was thatthe Allies should take over the Greek administration as an intermediate...
19 1I o Iintermediate regime pending the Peace Conference, with theright to replace officials who were unsatisfactory to them.He had suggested alternative ways of dealing with the per-manent problem of the Creek population,     The first alter-native was that there should be some form of guaranteeing-Turkish rule and his view was that the ideal solution wouldbe complete autonomy.     His second alternative, which he favoured, was that the whole Creek population should beallowed to return to Western Thrace, which would involvecareful previous preparation.     In the course of his corxver-sation, M* Vonizelos had mentioned the Greek population ofThrace and Constantinople as amounting to about a million.He (Lord Curzon) was advised that the population of eastern thrace could not exceed 500,000, and probably lay between300-500 thousand.   At any rate, it was a substantial figure,M, Venizelos hai, said he was leaving for Paris that night and would return soon, when he hoped to be able to announce that&apos; the Greek Government was willing to accept nis advice*Continuing, Lord Curzon said that the present situation in eastern Thrace-was that Commissions of Allied officers hadbeen sent to certain centres - a British Commission toRodosto, a French Commission to Adrlanople, and an ItalianCommission to Lule Burgas,     He thought there was generalagreement that if permitted to send detachments to eastern thrace, the Allies would do so and that if necessary this force would be supplemented by gendarmerie,     Behind theproblem of maintaining order, however, lay the question ofcivil administration.     In this connection he drew attentionto Sir Horace Rumbold&apos;s telegram Ho,506 in which he had stated.,,
stated that the High Commissioners considered that the only alternative was to consent to the Kemalists taking over the civil administration, his reply (Foreign Office telegram No.464) asking for explanations and enquiring whether, if control was to be exercised by Interallied mililitary Commissions or by officers or detachments pending the Peace Conference, it was impossible to retain the existing civil officials, and how they were to be persuaded to go.

Considerable discussion took place in regard to the above statement, in the course of which it was pointed out that there was some sign of a reaction in the French Press. The well-known writer in the "Echo de Paris", under the nom de plume of "Pertinax", for example, had insisted that the Turke must recall their soldiers from the neutral sones on the Asiastic shores of Dardanelles and must not be permitted to enter Thrace.   Allusion was also made to the indications that the American Government and public appeared to take much the same view as the British Government on these questions and that American warships were on their way to Turkish waters.

Later in the meeting   (after the discussions of the questions of Iraq and Rubber, recorded In subsequent Minutes) the Secretary of State for War read two telegrams which he had lust received.   fhe first telegram was a short summary ofthe Angora Government&apos;s reply to the Allied invitation (Constantinople telegram No.516).   The second was a telegram from Sir Horace Rumbold (No.513) recording the results of a meeting of the Allied High Commissioners at Constantinople. This telegram stated that according to the french High Commissioner...
Commissioner, the Turks demanded Karagatch, a suburb of Adrianople on the left bank of the Maritza; that H. Franklin Bouillon had urged on the French President of the Council (sic) that the British and Italian Generals should be empowered definitely to sign at Mudania the instrument recording the decisions of the Conference, instead of ad referendum to their respective Governments, the object being to avoid loss of time; that the Italian representative had suggested that the question of Karagatch should be reserved to the Mudania Conference and that the Mudania instrument should be signed subject to a clause providing that the instrument was conditional on acceptance by the Allied Governments. The Telegram continued that the French and Italian Generals had great latitude in the Mudania negotiations and that Sir Horace Rumbold had explained that His Majesty&apos;s Government had gone to the extreme limit in consenting to the Paris Note and that it was for the Kemalists to carry out the conditions laid down therein; further the he (Sir Horace Rumbold) could neither give instruction to General Harington about Karagatch nor authorise him to sign the Mudania protocol as proposed by M. Franklin-Bouillon.

The Cabinet agreed :-

(a) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should inform Sir Horace Rumbold that his attitude as described in the last telegram (No.513) was approved;

(b) That the information before the Cabinet in regard to the Mudania Conference was insufficient to enable them to take any decisions:

(c) That Members of the Cabinet should hold themselves ready for a meeting at short notice.


2. With reference to Conclusion 1 of a Conference ofMinisters held on August 28, 1922, at 4 p .m., the cabinet had under consideration a series of telegrams which had passed between the Secretary of State for the Colonies andthe High Commissioner for Iraq. (Papeas 0 .P.-4178 and 0.P,,-4383), together with a draft of the proposed Treaty with king Peisal, a copy of which was attached to C .P.-4178.The Cabinet were informed by the Secretary of statefor the Colonies that, after months of negotiation, a draft treaty with King Peisal had been prepared by the ColonialOffice experts in consultation with the Foreign Office.This draft Treaty conformed in all respects to the require-meats of the League of Nations, and also fully complied withthe pledge which had been given to King Peisal that in thecase of Iraq Great Britain would substitute a Treaty rela-tionship for a mandatory relationship.   Throughout the ideaof the Cabinet had been to establish Iraq as an independentArab State bound to Great Britain during the mandatory period by Treaty relations *   The Arabs were themselves opposed tothe- ordinary mandatory relationship, but it had been pointedout to them that under Article VI of the Treaty their objections could be satisfactorily met inasmuch as if andwhen Iraq was admitted to- the League of Nations the necessityfor any mandate would cease.   When a stable Government hadbeen established in the country, when the frontiers had beendefined, when an organic law had been passed and certain military and financial agreements had been definitely executed,then Great Britain would be prepared to advocate the admissionof Iraq to the League of Nations,   King Peisal had accepted this solution, and his acceptance had no doubt been influenced by his recent  illness and the energetic action taken by theHigh Commissioner in suppressing the extremists.   It had been
made clear th&amp;t in this particular matter the Governmentwould not d^al with Peisal alone, but that he must arrangefor the formation of a Ministry and act on the advice of his ministers, and that the Ministers themselves must give fullassurances that they would accept and work tbe Treaty.   TheHigh Commissioner bad succeeded in meeting these requirements,and all that was now necessary was to authorise him to sign the Treaty.   The moment for this action seemed opportune.Trouble with the Turk was the time for friendship with theArab, and inasmuch as the Treaty was extremely favourable toArab aspirations the publication of its terms would undoubt-edly have an excellent effect and would enable Peisal to unite the Arabs against any Turkish attack.   The Treaty didnot commit Great Britain to giving any definite militaryj or financial assistance?    it merely provided for the making of supplementary agreements dealing with military and financial arrangements.   If warlike operations could be avoided it seemed probable that next year the cost to the British Bxche-quer of Mesopotamia would be reduced to  4,000,000 as comparedwith  8,000,000 in the present year and  S3,000,000 two yearsago.The view was expressed that, while the successful conclusions-sion of the negotiations-was a matter of great satisfaction,there might be some doubt as to the possibility of King Peisalbeing able to maintain a civilised and stable Government inIraq.   The genius which the Arabs had displayed in the MiddleAges for administration had apparently disappeared.   Moreover,the personality of Peisal, who was weak and intriguing, didnot inspire confidence.   Nevertheless, there could be nodoubt that the course of action suggested was the right oneto adopt.
The Gabinet agreed -(a) To approve the proposals for the treaty with King Peisal in the form of the printeddraft annexed to Paper CP .-4178:(b) That the Secretary of State for the colonies should forthwith inform the High Commissionerfor Iraq of the Cabinet decision, notifyinghim of the text of the pub lie announcement tobe made, and authorising him to sign theTreaty on Hid Majesty&apos;s behalf.
I - 187LfcjS MILITARY        3,     The Cabinet had under consideration a MemorandumJjUATIOI IBIpaeHEKK by the Secretary of State for War (Paper CP.-4192) coveringffilLan Appreciation of the Military Situation in Iraq, in whichit was pointed out that, as a result of the withdrawal fromthe Sulaimaaish division, the line of communications betweenBaghdad and Ho sal was liable to be cut off if hostile forcesmade a flank advance of fifty miles.   Such a cutting of the communications would mean that the forces in Mosul would bebeleaguered.   In these circumstances it was important thatthe existing authority under which the fsoops at Mosul wereto retire in the event of their being attacked in force should be held to apply to a very serious threat to thelines of communication.The Cabinet were reminded that as from October 1st.the military forces in Mesopotamia would be -under the command of the Royal Air Force, and that that Porce would therefore certainly be used to the fullest extent in meetingany Turkish or Kurdish attacks.   Too much reliance shouldnot be placed on the Arab army.   It seemed probable that the assyrian levies would be capable of giving more effectivemilitary assistance, but it was clear that if the Turksattacked in force at Mosul neither the British nor the Arabscould put up an effective resistance.Reference was made to the powerful Air Poreestationed in Mesopotamia, and to the possibility of that force being able successfully to cope with any Turkish forceslikely to invade the Mosul vilayet.   The Cabinet were inform-ed that as from October 1st. the Air Ministry and not tbeI &apos;War Office were responsible for the defensive arrangements in Iraq.-iIThe...
She Cabinet agreed -That the Secretary of State for Air, inconsultation with the Secretary of Statefor War, should draft a telegram whichthe former should despatch to the air officer Commanding in Mesopotamia, informing him that if his more northerly detachmentsand lines of communication with Mosul were likely to be threatened by an enemy approach-ing sojith of Mosul, he was at liberty inconsultation with the High Commissioner tov/ithdraw the forces to whatever line hethought advisable, the paramount consider-ation being to avoid the garrison beingbeleaguered.
MPOSITION        4. The Cabinet were informed by the Ministsr of Agri-pp AC-RICUL-pBE, culture and Fisheries of the very serious situation inAgriculture caused by the heavy and rapid fall in prices.The Conciliation Committees, were finding it most difficultto deal with wage questions, inasmuch as the farmers main-tained their inability to pay more than 25/-S.a week, whilethe labourers represented that they could not live on lessthan SO/-s. a week.   The country was faced with a reductionof the arable acreage and with starvation wages.   This wasleading to Boards of Guardians finding out-door relief, andwe were threatened with a revival of some of the worstfeatures of the old Poor Law.   It was essential that somesteps should be taken as quickly as possible to relieve thesituation, and unless the Prime Minister was able to seethe proposed Deputation from the faiming interests and givejthem some promise of assistance there would be serious trouble throughout the countryside.The view was expressed that any proposal for givingspecial assistance to Agriculture would have to be most carefully considered in relation to the reactions on otherindustries, as, for example, the mining industry.   It was clearly essential that the Cabinet should have before them the proposals for affording permanent and temporary relief which were contemplated by the Minister of Agriculture, andthat the Treasury should have an opportunity of consideringthose proposals, which, moreover, would have to be examined in the light of any proposals for the relief of unemployment.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries should, as soon as possible,circulate the whole of his proposals to the Cabinet:(b) That the Minister of Health should arrangefor the circulation of his Paper containingcertain specific proposals for the relief of unemployment, and also any other Papersmaterial to the subject:
(c) That- the Papers referred to in (a) and (h)ahove should he considered at a meeting ofthe Cabinet to be held early in the follow-ing week.
The Cabinet took note of the Concltisions of thefollowing:-Conference of Ministers held on Angust 28,1932, at 4 p,m.:1. IRAQ,.3. KURDISTAN.3, BRITISH FORCES AT THE CHATA1JA LINES.4.

EXPORT DUTY ON RUBBER.

The Cabinet were informed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies that he desired to raise a question of great importance, namely, a proposal to impose an Export Duty on all rubber exported from the Malay States. 70 per cent. of the total rubber produced was exported to the United States of America. Whereas in 1918 the price of rubber was 13/- a pound, it was now 8d., and until recently had been selling at 6d. a pound. Great Britain would have to pay £50,000,000 a year to the United States of America in respect of the Anglo-American Debt, and rubber and tin were the principal products with which this payment could be made. At the present moment both these products were being supplied to the United States below the cost of production. In the case of rubber this was due to over-production in the past and to the failure of the producers to reach an agreement among themselves. The rubber estates in Malay, in which had been sunk over £120,000,000 of British capital, were in serious danger of bankruptcy, and the imposition of the proposed Export Duty would enable the producers to restrict the output. The details of the proposed scheme were of a very elaborate character, but the arrangements had been agreed by the producers and by practically all the large British users of rubber. It was true that the efforts which had been made to bring the Dutch producers into line had so far failed, but the British growers in Dutch territory were in favour of the scheme. The agreement would be for ten years, and in effect the price of rubber would probably be raised by about 10d. a pound. The Exchequer would benefit indirectly by the increase in Income Tax and Super-tax which would be payable in respect of the profits of the British Rubber Companies.

The Cabinet were reminded that unless some arrangement of this character was speedily brought into force the plantations would become derelict. So far as could be ascertained, 




the consumers of rubber were more concerned with a stable price than a low price, and there was some reason to believe that the present low price of rubber was due to the action of certain American interests which desired to obtain control of the industry.

A suggestion was made that the proposal raised the question of the monopoly enjoyed by France and Great Britain of tropical productions, and that the feeling would undoubtedly be created that Great Britain was misusing her monopoly in the interests of the capitalists. On the other hand, it was pointed out that the proposed Duty would be applied to all rubber exported from the Malay States, whether to the British Empire or elsewhere, and that no question of Imperial Preference was involved.

The Cabinet agreed -

(a) That the Colonial Office experts should consult with the Foreign Office experts, and that if the latter saw no Foreign Office objection, the Secretary of State for the Colonies should be authorised to take steps to empower the Government of the Malay States to impose the contemplated Expert Duty on rubber:

(b) That the Secretary of State for the Colonies should consider whether Ceylon and any other rubber-producing British Colonies should not be required to impose a similar Export Duty simultaneously with the Malay States:

(c) That, having regard to the importance of maintaining secrecy, the record of the Cabinet decision should be retained by the Secretary until a public announcement of the Government&apos;s decision had been made.

!U With reference to Cabinet 23(22) Conclusion3,     the Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Conference that he would be obliged to ash for cabinet decisions in regard to Mesopotamia in the nearfuture.     He then explained the general politicalsituation in Iraq which wgs as follows -.King Feisal had been making groat difficulties and confusing the situation in Iraq.     Ee had madeobjections to the Mandate but had stated his willingness to agree to a Treaty.     He was not, however, preparedto recognise the mandatory basis as he thought thatthe mandatory system was a slur on Iraq.     No argumenthad been of any effect with him.     He had recently taken up the Fxtremists who now regarded him as theirpatron.     Various expedients had been tried with aview to smoothing away difficulties and the HighCommissioner had recently suggested that the BritishGovernment should refuse to sign the Treaty at present,should demand the holding of Elections and the consequent summoning, of a Constituent Assembly;,- andshould put the Treaty before that Assembly.     If thoAssembly refused it the British Government shouldabandon the policy of remaining in Iraq and 3houldWithdraw but still rotain control over Basra.     TheHigh Commissioner had expressed the view that Felsalwould not disagree with those proposals and that theConstituent Assembly would accept the Treaty on a mandatory basis.     HO had asked for a decision by august 23rd, but the Secretary of State for theGolonies had replied by telegram on August 22ndstating that a Cabinet decision would be taken earlyin September,     He authorised the High commissioner to inform Feisal that meanwhile ho (Feisal) was res-ponsible for preventing violence which would nave most
disastroxis consequences to Iraq. /The Secretary of State then read to the conference various telegrams which describedevents since the despatch of his telegram ofAugust 22nd to the High Commissioner.      (iTos.595, 594, 59s?, 598, 604, 605, 606 and 607).Prom those telegrams it appeared that inco-operation with the ExtremistsFeisal, whilst outwardly deferring to the HighCommissioner&apos;s view that the Iraq cabinet should remain until the Treaty was concluded,had so behaved that all the Ministers, with one exception, had tendered their resignations.The result was that there was no Cabinet in iraq and Peisal, in a.personal letter which the HighCommissioner had received oh August 21st, had stated that owing to the delay in the conclusionof tho Treaty the internal situation had now reached a stage which gave great cause for anxiety.He accordingly asked the High Commissioner toInform the British Government that in the eventof any outbreak either the High commissioner should assume as British representative full responsibility for maintenance of security, or else he (Peisal) should be made responsiblehimself and be given a free hand.     He asked fora definite reply from the Secretary of State assoon as possible.     To this demand the HighCommissioner had replied that the delay insignature of the Treaty was due to the inability of the British Government to comply withFeisal*s wishes regarding the abrogation ofthe Mandate.     His Majesty&apos;s Government had
1 V&apos; 9JL J obeen asked to take a final decision and make afinal and public offer to Iraq, but as the decision could not be taken before a Cabinet meeting earlyin September it was the duty of Iraq to wait for it patiently.     As regards responsibility forsectu*ity Feisal could not divest himself of hisshare of it, and it was for his Government and theHigh Commissioner to consult together and to devise measures to meet the situation.     Thepersons principally responsible for the unrest wereindividuals who enjoyed his support and sympathy and all that was needed to stop unrest was a clear indication from Feisal himself.     The HighCommissioner had added that in his opinion a gravepersonal responsibility for the present situationdevolved upon Feisal.     In any case the proper course was for the Government of Iraq to confer with him, and in the event of his advice beingneglected  he proposed   to take such action as might be necessary after consulting with the GeneralOfficer Commanding,     He would be loath to do so,but warned Feisal that tiie responsibility for sucha step and its consequences would rest on hisshoulders.     In communicating to the Secretary ofState the tenor   of his reply to Feisal the. HighCommissioner added that he had arranged for regu-lar aerial patrols.     On August 23rd the HighCommissioner, whilst attending en official reception,found that Feisal had received tho Fxtremist partyimmediately before, andthat an anti-British spooch was being delivered and received with applause in the courtyard of the palace.     The High Commissioner had demanded animmediate apology and the dismissal of the King!sChsmberlain.
On August S4th, the High Commissioner had visitedFeisal and endeavoured to persuade him to arrest theleaders of the Extremists.     Having failed to d* so he had himself acted, and had caused the arrest of fourextremists.of the most important/   Others were being searched for..The Jixtremist Party had been suppressed temporarilyand its office closed.     Two newspapers had been suppressedand the Editors had been or were about to be arrested.The high Commissioner was about to issue   ar. announcement that the final offer of ills Majesty&apos;s Government would bemade early in September,        that the responsibility for maintaining order was a joint one between the Governmentof Iraq, and himself5^ $wing to the resignation of theCabinet and the illness of the King, the High Commissionerresponsibility forhad taken/action necessary to maintain security.   Ina subsequent telegram the High Commissioner had statedhis personal opinion of *&apos;feisal vhich was that ho was quiteunfitted for his position and was directly responsiblefor unrest in Iraq? and for bad administration.     Thelast news from the High Commissioner was that Feisalfrom his recent operation was convalescing        1  - ard wou..c; now have to choose between supporting the High Commissioner and dissociatinghimself from the latter&apos;s action.     Tho High Commissionerproposed, if he was obliged to interview him beforereceiving any indication of the views of the BritishaGovernment, to state that Fei3al had now/li.st opportunityto change his attitude and to demand the clearance ofthe objectionable portion of his entourage and renewedassurances that Feisal would abstain from interferencewith/
appointmentswith regard to and details of internal administration.Some discussion took place on the situation disclosed by the telegrams from the High commissioner and the opinion was expressed that if it became necessary eventually to withdraw from Iraq, Feisalshould not be allowed to remain there in any case.The Conference agreed(l)    That the iiecretary of State forthe Colonies should generally supportthe policy adopted by the HighCommissionerand should approve the action which the High Commissionerproposed to take.(S)    To take note of the intention of theSecretary of State for the colonies to bring   tho whole question ofBritish policy towards Iraq beforethe Cabinet at an early date 6probably about the middle of September.
KURDISTAN.

2. The Secretary of State for the Colonies read to the Conference a telegram from the High Commissioner of Iraq. dated August 27th (see Appendix) regarding an incursion into Rania by a Turkish band of 200 men under Euz Demir. The High Commissioner had enquired whether it would not be possible to remonstrate with the Angora Government regarding the hostile activities of Euz Demir

The Conference took note of the Communications made to it by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, but came to no decision in regard to the suggestion made by the High Commissioner of Iraq.

BRITISH FORCES AT THE CHATALJA LINES.

3. With reference to Cabinet 43/22 (4) of August 3rd, 1922, the Conference was informed that if it was proposed to retain the British forces at the Chatalja lines it would now be necessary to provide hutting accommodation for the winter at an estimated cost of £120,000. The Greek forces in Thrace amounted to 25,000 rifles, and an abandonment of the Chatalja lines by the British forces would be resented by the French who would be left to face the Greeks alone.

It was pointed out that the recent reports of large Greek reinforcements having proceeded to Thrace had now been found to have been much exaggerated, as the reinforcements amounted only to two or three battalions; that a force of 25,000 rifles was not unduly large considering the disturbed state of the country, and that an attack on the Chatalja lines by the Greeks was extremely improbable. Large expenditure on hutting ....


hutting for British troops -at tho-ChataXja^linas ^could not therefore he justified.The Conference agreed  That, subject to tha concurrence of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, it was no longer necessary to retain British troops at the Chatalja lines, and that theprovision of winter quarters forsuch troops was thereforeunnecessary.4.        With refsrence to Cabinet 46(22) Conclusion 1 ofthe ConferenceAugust 14th, 1922,/was informed that Sir john bradbury had reported that the position in regardto the negotiations between tha Reparation Commissionand the German Government was very serious.   An offerhad been made by the Germans (Hsrr Stinnes being a party) to guarantee the delivery of reparations inhind by commercial contracts with industry, but theFrench representative on the Reparation commission was not disposed to accept this offer.     TheCommission had met yesterday and it was probablethat in view of the French casting vote, a majority in favour of a moratorium would not be obtained.Tho Commission had agreed to hear the GermanGovernment on Wednesday, August 30th and would post-pone their final decision until Thursday August 31st.An alternative suggestion had been made that if a moratorium ware not granted the Belgian government might accept Preach Treasury Bills as collateralsecurity for their Reparations priority.Sir John BradburyTs view was that the onlychance of keeping Germany going was an unconditionalmoratorium with control of her finance by foreignadvisers appointed by the Reparation Commission,
2t y dfrom...impartial, sources, and he s tated -that&quot;there, wasa good deal of opinion in -Germany in favour ofsuch control.Some discussion took place on the situation disclosed by Sir John Bradbury&apos;a Report, and it waspointed out that unless the Reparation Commissiondeclared Germany to be wilfully in defaa.lt theFrench Government would be unable to take actionagainst Germany without infringing the Treaty*It was also pointed out that the proia.esal totohand ovor/the Belgian Government,French treasury bills would probably be deeply resented in Praaeeand that such action might be regarded as an affront;whereas Belgian Bills were a good asset to theUnited Kingdom.     It was not possible to say whatthe decision of tho Reparation Commission on August31st would bej    private negotiations between the delegates wore continuing, but it was stated thatM*poincare was still intractableSir John Bradbury hoped that if tha situation was serious ho would, be able to secure an adjournment of the meeting of the Reparation Commission to be heldon August 31st, and that he would be prepared to come toLondon to explain matters.Tho Conference agreed  That no action on tho part of his majesty s Government was possible atthe moment, and that Sir John Bradbury1soffer to come to London if the situation was serious should be accepted.2 whitehall Gard ens, S *W.1.&amp;8th August, 192E.

No.606 of 27th August.

See my despatch Sec et C. dated August 18th sent last Air Mail Situation in Rania area described in appreciation forwarded the rewith is now developing somewhat seriously. Telegram from Rania dated August 25th stated that the whole of Naodasht area is now controlled by Euzdemir and his band, which has been halted twelve miles from Rania since August 16th and is now reported to have been reinforced. Trans frontier tribes are very threatening and it appears probable that deliberate attack will be made on Rania. All possible steps are being taken by General Officer Commanding to meet situation with slender resources at his command.

I notice that newspapers forwarded by last mail report that Fathi Bey now representing Angora Government speaks in conciliatory terms of Turks attitude towards Iraq. Would it not be possible to remonstrate with Angora Government through him regarding Euz Demir&apos;s hostile activities and to get orders sent for withdrawal of his party.

6 U the Conference had been called to consider replies to be sent to a telegram from General Harington (I To22Z5 dated 9th Sept. 1922) and telegrams from the Commander in-Chief Mediterranean,  (Nos.293, 294, 295, dated 11thSeptember, 1922),    In the course of the meeting a draft telegram which the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs proposed to send to Sir Horace Rumbold was received and read.    (Appendix I.)THE SECRETARY OF ST&apos;*TE FOR !7AR pointed out that inview of the successes of Kemal it was probable that he would soon threaten Chanak with troops or make a public demand that our troops should be withdrawn.    It was the policyof the Cabinet to withdraw from Chanak and this ought tobe done before Kemal demanded it.    Such withdrawal should beto Gallipoli.    On the other hand should the French andAllies agree to sho^ their flag with oixrs at Chanakevacuation could be postponed.    If they refused we shouldbe justified in withdrawing.In the course of the discussion GENERAL CHETT/ODEinformed the Conference that in the view of the V*rar Officeand Admiralty Kemal could not for some time bring heavy guns to Chanak but  that if later on he brought up 6&quot; gunsit would be difficult if not impossible for destroyers,cruisers, or store ships, to pass up the straits.    Battle-ships could, but they would have to return to the opensea to refurnish.    He thought there might still be someTurkish gins on the Chanak side.THE prime MINISTER stated that in the eventuality ofa war In the future in which the Turks were on the side ofour enemies it was vital that we should retain the controlof the Straits and b^ able to cover Constantinople toplant&apos;guns on Galiipoli which could destroy Turkishbatteries on the Asiatic side.    That was the permanentpolicy to be borne in mind.    There vraa no present Intention.o*? defending Chanak by land reinforcements and general harington should see before evacuating that any-guns in the Chanak area were dismantled-
The Conference next considered how best to giveeffect to the policy of the Cabinet of maintaining theposition reached in the Paris agreement.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the Greeks hadbeen forced to evacuate Anatolia and we did not propose to stand on the Ismid Peninsula.     It was essential that weshoiild prevent troops being transferred by  emailsts toThrace to attack Gallipoli from the North.     In the recentcase when Constantinople was alleged to be threatened bythe Graehs we intervened and prevented the Greeks dealinga blow at the Turks where they were most vulnerable     Ineffect we forced the Greeks to fight where they were at a disadvantage.     It was now our duty to refuse to allow the turk to oross into Europe and upset the arrangement con-cluded by Lord Curson in March last in Paris.TEE FIRST LORD OF TEE ADMIRALTY, after explaining that, in the view of the Naval Staff, the problem was mainly one of denying transport by sea to the Kemal istforces, read the following proposals of the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean:-(a)   Kemalists should be informed that,  failingsatisfactory guarantees that they will mafceno attempt to land in Gallipoli, all flaat-ing transport will be destroyed;fb)   Ponding reply as precautionary measure alltransport in Dardanelles and Bosphorous tobe stopped from- proceeding to Asiatic-Marmora ports.The Conference expressed a preference for the secondproposal over the first, but considered that the aotion ofthe fleet should be directed to prevent the transport of the kemalists, at any point, from Asia Minor to the Europeanside^MALTA/
MALTA BATTALION

The Conference were informed that the battalion now available in Malta could be conveyed to Constantinople by September 17th.

MOSUL.

The Conference were informed by the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR that oven if Kemal did not follow up his victories rapidly in Thrace we should feel his presence in the Mosul area and in Irak generally. There are two to three thousand Turkish troops North and North-West of Mosul, and with the help of the Tribes Kemal could put us out of Mosul in a fortnight. As the result of a recent skirmish we had been driven from Rania by a band of Turks and Kurds.

The conclusions of the Conference may be summarised as follows:-

(1) The draft telegram from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to Sir Horace Rumbold (Appendix I) was approved and the Acting Secretary was requested to arrange with the Foreign Office that Sir Horace Rumbold should shew the telegram to Admiral Brock as well as to General Harington.

(2) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should inform the French and Italian Governments of the Cabinet&apos;s policy as set out in the afore-mentioned telegram, should invite their co-operation, but should make plain that should their co-operation not be forthcoming H-M-Government would proceed alone.

(3) The draft telegram prepared by the Secretary of State for War to General Harington was approved. (Appendix II)

(4) The First Lord should instruct the Commander-in-Chief. Mediterranean, to take every action necessary to prevent Kemalist troops being conveyed to the European shore.

(5) The Secretary of State for War should instruct the Commander-in-Chief, Constantinople, to destroy any guns in the Chanak area before evacuating-

go Sir Borapen 5umbold^f romJOord. Ourzon.We axe doubtful from his telegrams whetherlrejnexaXJla^is fully aware of policy which was approved by Cabinet onThursday.    It aras, while liquidating the situation in Anatoliato maintain the position in Europe which was taken up winter Paris in March and which can only be altered by conferenceof Powers concerned.Ihhs, as it was not contemplated to hold Chanak in March,so it is thought undesirable to hold it now unless, which is most unlikely, the French and Italians were prepared to join in its defence.     H.M.Government do not contemplate holding italono and War Office have authorised Commander^-in-Chief to with-draw British forces, vOn the other hand,-H.M.Government have not the slightestintention of.abandoning Gallipoli position and are prepared tosend reinforcements to Haringtc$: to enable.: him to hold it.    Itwill of course be better that this occupation should be allied occupation, and we are addressing the French and Italian Govern-ments in this sense.    If however they refuse we should act alone,and British fleet would assist the operations.As regards the Ismid line H.M.Government did not think it likely that French and Italian troops would co-operate in their defence and therefore they propose to authorise Earington towithdraw British force sooner than incur defeat.In pursuance of principle previously laid down Constantinople-should be held at all costs with assistance if necessary of fleet.It was deemed incredible that French and Italians would not join in this defence.This statement of policy may be useful to you in present emergency and you should communicate it to Harington,
From War OfficeTo General Harington,  Constantinople.       11,9.22.See telegram iTo.374 of to-day&apos;s date from Curson to Rumbold..As Cabinet do not intend to hold Chanak wo do not propose to reinforce thero; you can evacuate at your discretion, afterinforming Allied Generals.   Evacuation might be postponed ifFrench and Italian troops are also placed in Chanak, but we donet wish the position to arise of British troops above being inChanak and forced to evacuate, either after some public declaration by Aemal calling upon them to do. so, or after amilitary threat on their part.    Before evacuation any Turkishguns left in Chanak area should be destroyed.As ?/e do not intend to defend the Ismind Peninsula you may,at your discretion, also withdraw those troops.t/B shall endeavour to secure a declaration by the Allies thatthey will not allow kemalists to transfer troops from Asia tothe European side and the Havy have instructions to preventdotransport from being used for that purpose; if our Allies/jaotco-operate we shall act alone in that respect.Be are not satisfied that Gallipoli shall be held by French aMItalians alone;  therefore we-suggest that troops at Chanakshould be evacuated to Gallipoli.Bo you require the additional battalion from iialta in the abovecircumstances?

VENIZELOS.

1. THE LORD PRIVY SEAL informed the Conference that Sir Edward Grigg and Mr Vansittart had interviewed M. Vanizelos that morning, and then read to the Conference a repport of the interview. (Paper No. S.66)

THE PRIME MINISTER noted that the remarks of M. Venizalelos as regards the Greek moral were at variance with the reports received from the military authorities. He brought to notice the fact that M. Venizelos had never misled the British Government as regards the value of the Greek Army. He suggested that the Secretary to state for Foreign Affairs should have an interview with M. Venizelos the next day and tell him of the reports which had been received.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR informed the Conference that the General Staff were preparing an appreciation on the value of the Greek Army with reference to the reports which had been received from General Harington.

REPLY TO ? POINCARE&apos;S PROTEST.

4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS drew attention to Lord Hardinge&apos;s? telegram No. 492, of September 30th, 1922, recording ?. Poincaré&apos;s protest against the decision of the British Government, without consulting with the French Government, to send an ultimatum to the local Turkish Nationalist Commander at Chanak. He considered that it would be inadvisable to send any reply until it was known that action General Harington had taken on the receipt of the orders contained in War Office telegram No. 91255, of September 29th, for it was possible that the Turkish forces might have withdrawn of their own second from close contact with the British forces, in which case there would be no need to inform the French Government of what the British Government&apos;s instructions had been. The Independent action of the British Government was only following M. Poincaré&apos;s example when he had considered himself at liberty to withdraw the French troops from the neutral zone without reference to us. After the French troops had withdrawn, the responsibility of maintaining the position at Chanak in order to guarantee the neutrality of the Straits -- a responsibility which had been accepted by other Allice -- had devolved on British troops alone.

THE PRIME MINISTER remarked that there was no similarity between the present position and the Ruhr.



See Conclusions (f) and (g) attached.


POSITITION IN THE NEAR EAST.

5. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS read to the Conference the following telegrams which had been received from Sir Horace Rumbold:- Nos. 483, 484, 485, 486 and 488, and draw attention to the fact that it appeared from these telegrams, and others which had been received from General Harington, that General Harington was paying rather too much attention to the political situation, which should be left to Sir Horace Rumbold, and not paying sufficient attention to the military situation.

In answer to a question by the Prime Minister, THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR replied that no answer had yet been received from General Harington to War Office telegram No. 91255. This Telegram had been sent off the previous day at 3 p.m., and at the same time had been sent to the Admiralty for transmission by wireless.

General surprise was expressed that no news of the receipt of this telegram had yet been received.

THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF stated that this telegram, being an Operation Order, would undoubtedly be acknowledged, but since there were many "Clear the line" messages on the wires at present the acknowledgment might be considerably delayed.

THE PRIME MINISTER then referred to the current "Daily Telegraph", which contained a wire from the "Daily Telegraph" Correspondent giving the reply of the Angora Government to the Allied invitation. He considered this reply a disquieting one, since the Nationalists apparently demanded the immediate possession of Constantinople and also Eastern and Western Thrace. This reply was transmitted with the reservation that it would have to be ratified by the Grand National Assembly. This Telegram must have reached the "Daily Telegraph" by 3 a.m. He did not understand why no official news had been received.

It was suggested that the Turkish Nationalists would send their official reply to M. Poincaré, since the invitation had been issued from Paris, and that the "Daily Telegraph"


Correspondent had probably obtained the answer-at the time it was being sent to Paris .THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR then referred to a tele-gram No. G.-12, which had just been received by the Navy,from Mustabha Kemal for transmission to- General Harington.This telegram   remarked   that as the Greek Fleet had been removed from Constantinople it might be assured that itwould not be allowed to return there;    further, it commentedon the demolitions which were b^ing carried out for military reasons in Chanak, and projected in the rieighbourhood ofthe effectConstantinople,   The telegram continued to that orders had been issued to the local Turkish Commander that thetroops at Gbanak should re*-ent-r the neutral zone but shouldnot provoltf? anjr incident, and concluded by stating that if theBritish troops withdrew from the Asiatic shore Mustapha Kemalwas ready to give orders that his forces on the Straits shouldretire slightly, and that he himself would meet general harington as soon as he could after returning from Angora.It was pointed out that this telegramand had no connection with the one which had appeared in the&quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, which was a more serious one sine** itpurported to be the official r^ply of the National Assembly.THE PRIME MINISfrr considered that no definite decisions could be taken until a reply had be-fn received from general harington with regard to telegram No.91255.    He was of opinion,from the telegrams which had been read to the Conference, thatGeneral Harington was so much concerned with the politicalsituation   vrhich was not rightly his   that he did notdevote sufficient attention to the military situation.    he himself was of opinion that at present no conflis t had yettaken place,THF. SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS hoped thatfiring had not yet taken place.    From the telegrams which hadbeen received today he thought the situation was better and- 5--
that Mustapha Komai Was- -more reasonable   He shoved signsof being ready to attend a meeting at Mudania; and alsothe Allied Conference, and it must.  &apos; be borne -drr mind that though he put forward extravagant demands., this was always the custom of the Oriental.At this point the Conference adjourned until &amp; reply should be received fromGeneral Harington.Whitehall Gardens,&apos; S .W..1,September CO,  19Z2.
The Conference agreed -

VENIZELOS.

(a) That the Secretary should circulate to the Ministers at the Conference the report on the interview of Sir Edward Grigg and Mr Vansittart, on the morning of September, 30 1922 with M. Venizelos.

(b) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of State for War and an Officer of the General Staff, should meet M. Venizelos on the following day and

(i) ascertain from him appreciation of the political situation in Greece:

(ii) Communicate to him the gist of the reports regarding the loss of moral of Greek troops, which had been received from the military authorities, and ascertain his opinion as to the present condition of the Greek Army and what might be expected from it in the defence of Thrace or elsewhere.



VALUE OF THE GREEK ARMY.



General Staff Appreciation.

(c) That the Secretary of State for War should circulate to the Cabinet the General Staff appreciation on the value of the Greek Army with reference to the reports contained in General Harington&apos;s telegrams Nos. 2526 and 

2524.



Mr HUGHES&apos; SPEECH TO THE AUSTRALIAN PARLIAMENT

(d) To take note of the telegrams from the Governor-General of Australia c? extracts from the speech which had been made by Mr Hughes to the Australian Parliament the previous evening with a view to strengthening the hands of the British Government in the present crisis.



EXTRA OFFICERS FOR THE AIR FORCE.



(a) That though the Air Ministry could at present take no steps with regard to engaging the extra Flying Officers which they would require in the event of mobilisation, they should have ready plans for the engaging of such officers as would be required.



REPLY TO M. POINCARE&apos;S PROTEST.

(f) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should prepare a reply to Lord Hardings&apos;s telegram No. 492, of September 30, 1922 recording M. Poincaré&apos;s protest against the decision of the British Government, without consultation with the French Government, to send an ultimatum to the local Turkish Nationalist Commander at Chanak. This reply, inter alia, should recall that at the recent Conversations in Paris Lord Curzon had, on September 20th, twice notified M. Poincaré that ? France had withdrawn her troops from Asia, and from Chanak in particular, regard-less of the Allied responsibility for the defence of the Neutral zones, the British Government would be free to take independent and isolated action (See British Secretary&apos;s Notes, 20th September, 1922, 11 a.m. p.3, and 4 p.m., p.2). Further, the reply should point out that the French troops had been withdrawn from the neutral zone without previous consultation with their Allies, and that after their withdrawal the responsibility had devolved upon the British troops alone to maintain the position at Chanak. The reply should further point out that there was no similarity with the situation on the Ruhr, referred to by M. Poincaré.

1. The Conference was arranged for the consideration of a message received shortly before by Sir Maurice Hankey from the Prime Minister. (Appendix I)

?

2. THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF read and handed in a revised statement showing the programme of arrival of medium heavy artillery at Gallipoli. (Appendix II) He added that, beyond this programme, it would be impossible to man any further heavy batteries without mobilisation.

Every available trained garrison gunner was absorbed in the manning of these guns. Moreover, the General Staff was doubtful whether sites for larger numbers of heavy guns than these within a distance at which effective support could be given to the Chanak position, could be found on the Gallipoli Peninsula opposite Chanak. The proposed 9.2 " howitzers were not considered by artillery experts to be suitable: 8" howitzers were much preferred. 

The Conference agreed:-

That the War Office should consult General Harington by telegram as to whether he would wish to have sent to him the 16 6"guns (the last item in Appendix II) which are being prepared.

? GUNS.

3. THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY reported that 6.6" naval guns and mountings were available at Malta, and could be sent to Gallipoli if desired. They were heavy weapons and would require tractors. There were some other naval guns and mountings available in England. Doubts were expressed as to the suitability of these high velocity, low traject? weapons and their ammunition.

On the question of ammunition for naval guns generally, the First Lord gave some desails? of the rather small stocks of shrapnel shell still remaining from the the war, which were being sent to the Mediterranean.

The Conference were Informed that no Tanks werebeing sent out to General HaringtonCommand. The french had some small tanks in Constantinople.THE CHIEF OF TEE IMPERIAL GE^ERaL S TAFF stated thatthe Intelligence Division of the General Staff were making enquiries as to whether the Turks possessed tanks, and generally as to their equipment.$MB GUHS. 6..       THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL - GENERAL STAFF stated thattho battalions under General Harington&apos;e Command had 8Viokers and 16 Lewis Machine guns per battalion.P^SSSIBIS/
He strongjy deprecated any idea of strengthening the force in the Constantinople area in machine gunsby drawing maohine gun sections from battalions athome, as this would break up the organisation and reducethe efficiency of any further divisions it might ultimately become necessary to mobilise.
?SIBLE ENFORCEMENT OF AIR PERSONNEL.

7. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES, drew attention to the fact that there were 1.000 mechanics, etc., of the Royal Air Force, without arms, on board a transport now approaching Port Said, on route for Mesopotaia, who could if necessary be diverted to Constantinople. Owing to the technical character, and the costly training involved, they ought not be used as infantry, but they might be utilised for maintaining order at Constantinople, thus releasing other troops for the menaced position at Chanak.

THE AIR MARSHAL, though emphasising the need for this personnel in Mesopotamia, and entering a cavcat that they were not specially trained for other than their technical duties, agreed with the Ministers and other present:-

That the War Office should telegraph to General Harington explaining the position and asking if he would like to receive this personnel pending the arrival of the military reinforcements en route.

8. During the meeting attention was drawn to the position at Kum Kale, guns at which had caused serve inconvenience and loss during the Gallipoli campaign, after the evacuation of their position by the French forces early in the campaign.

The view was expressed that the available forces had probably been considered insufficient to justify its occupation.

MILITARY CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING THE ? OF THE PROPOSED CONFERENCE.

9. Attention was drawn to the persistent mention in reports of Mustapha Kemal&apos;s attitude of September 30th as the date when he would advance:-

It was agreed:-

That the Foreign Office should ask Lord Curzon in Paris to consider the desirability, if practicable, of fixing a date for the Conference prior to september 30th.

10. SIR WILLIAM TYRRELL stated that he had received a telephone message from Lord Curzon in Paris expressing misgivings regarding the orders which he understood had been sent to the Naval Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean, giving him authority to take such steps as he deemed necessary to prevent the Turkish Nationalist forces from crossing to Europe by the Straits, Marmora, or Black Sea, including stops to control, restrict the movement of , and impound shipping in their waters. Lord Curzon considered that these measures would be highly provocative. Lord Curzon had also expressed misgivings on similar grounds regarding a proclamation which Sir Horace Rumbold had reported to him that the naval Commander-in-Chief was about to issue restricting the movements of shipping.

THE SECRETARY gave a summary of the circumstances described in the following letter which, after communication with the Prime Minister he had written that afternoon to Admiral of the Fleet, Lord Beatty, coppies of which had been sent to all the Ministers present:-



22nd September, 1922.



Dear Lord Beatty, 



After receiving your telephone message at the Colonial Office this morning, I returned to my own office and examined carefully my notes of the meeting on Tuesday evening at 9.30 p.m.

I felt satisfied that my notes would justify including the following additional conclusion:

(1) That the Admiralty should be authorised to notify the Naval Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean that measures to prevent the transport of Turkish Nationalists forces to the Marmora Islands or to the European shores of the Straits and the Sea of Marmora should not be regarded as provocative action.



I accordingly/

 
I accordingly rang up your Private Secretary, Paymaster Captain Spickernell, and told him that I would ask the Prime Minister&apos;s authority for this. I gathered however,  from Spickernell that you desired a more exact interpretation than this, and I did not feel justified on my own responsibility, in going further than the draft conclusion above.

I accordingly rang up Mr. J.T. Davies, the Prime Minister&apos;s Secretary, who was with the Prime Minister in the country and explained the position to him, asking for authority for the above additional conclusion and adding that I had gathered from Spickernell that the Commander-in-Chief might want to take precautionary measures even to the extent of dealing with the small craft and row-boats in Bosphorus.

After consulting the Prime Minister, Mr. Davies told me that the Prime Minister&apos;s view is that no Kemalist forces must be allowed to cross the salt water. The moment a Kemalist gets afloat he must be dealt with. If he believes that there is danger of Kemalist forces crossing the Straits, the Admiral must use his discretion to take any action which he deems essential to prevent this.

All the Ministers present. stated that t-hey^TiadrunibaT^stood that the decision of the Conference of&apos;Ministers onthe previous Tuesday evening at 9.30 p.m., had heen toavoid fettering Admiral Brock Ts discretion in respect tothe moment when it should become essential to take pre-cautlonary measures for safeguarding against the possibilityof the transport to Europe of Mustapha Kemal&apos;s forces.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY then handed Sir WilliamTyrrell a copy of the actual instructions sent to AdmiralBrock by the - aagafeAdmiralty on 22nd September,1922 (at 1405).   He drew special attention to a passage atthe end in which the decision as to when these steps shouldbe taken was left to the Naval   Commander-in-Chief with theHigh Commissioned and Military Commander-in-Chief.SIR WILLIAM TYRRELL then left the meeting to consult his colleagues in the Foreign Office, but returned a few minutes later and informed Lord Lee that, after reading theinstructions, the Foreign Office were satisfied.The Conference agreed(a) To concur in the view of the Prime Minister. as expressed in Sir Maurice&apos;Hankey*s letterto Lord Beatty. and in the instructions issued by the Admiralty after Tuesday*s&apos;meeting as correctly reflecting the intentionof the Conference of Ministers at that meeting.(b)(c)That the Foreign Office should Immediatelytelephone to Lord Curzon in Paris the pertinentpassages of the Admiralty1s instructions.That the Foreign Office should telegraph to theHigh Commissioner at Constantinople-that theNaval Commander-in^Chief is authorised to take this action when he thinks necessary.

*) 9 n&amp; 3 UAPPENDIX    I.Telephone Message receive 1 from the Prime minister by&apos;Sir Maurice Hankey at 4.30 p.m, on 22nd September1922.I think we have net yet exhausted the possibilities ofmaking up by a mechanical superiority for our weakness in landpower and that this ought to be further examined insmediatelv with aview to strengthening (1) our gun power on Gallipoli (6&quot;, 8&quot;,9.2&quot; howitzers) in order to overwhelm any concentration   whichKemal could possibly bring to bear and to put his guns outof action.      We have at our disposal large numbers of gunsand ammunition and if we had them concentrated on GallipoliKemal could not make any impression upon our defences atChonak,    (2) More might be done in the way of strengtheningair power by bombing,  and machine-guns from the airi      i cannot help thinking that by a combination of naval guns,  andhowitzers on Gallipoli, machine-guns bombing and firing we couldmoke it impossible for the Turks to approach Chanak and as^11 one hears about them leads one to believe thet they areinferior certainly out of trenches to European troops theymight be effected with panic and disperse.      It would be agreat triumph if we could defeat a heavy Turkish attack alonewithout any assistance from the French and demonstrate tothe world that even from a military point of view we are not as helpless  as our enemies of every description imagine usto be.      I would therefore be glad if you would communicate this message to the Secretary of State for War, First lord and the Colonial Secretary and ask them to consider it immediately.      The Kemalists indicate September 30th beyond which they will not wait.      I cannot help thinking that agood- 1 -
good deal could be done In the few days at our disposal to hurry up material of this kind.      The Turks are rarely up todate and they could not in any event bring heavy grins up for weeks and we cOuld amass unmlstakeable superiority inmaterial before that happened, but no time should be lost.

It.would beneedssary to esta/establish a base on the Dardanelles if further large quantities of ammunition&apos; and stores were sent out.   Brigadier-General McHardy had left that day forConstantinople as Major-General. in charge of Administration.It was not yet known what landing facilities were available at Chanak.iIIOH IN     2. LORD LEE pointed out that the Navy could not under-ANTINOPLEiOOpS ARE . take the responsibility of preventing the Turks fromSAW.crossing the Bosphorus,.&apos; if the troops were withdrawn from constantinople,, unless counter batteries were established on European shore. . He enquired if it was propose:&quot; toestablish such batteries.MR. CHURCHILL replied that if the troops were Withdrawnfrom Constantinople it was quite certain that general harington would not mount guns on the Bosphorus whichwould be quite unprotected.    If the Turks advanced along the Ismid peninsula the probable sequence of events wasthat we should first withdraw our military forces&apos;fromthe Peninsula.    The Admiralty - would then remove all craftfrom the Bosphorus.    The Turks would then advance along the peninsula o,nd their artillery would come into action.&apos;;fc should prevent the movement of shipping - in the black sea and the Sea of Marmora,-   If peace were not thenestablished it might be necessary for our ships in the black Sea to run the gauntlet through the Bosphorusinto the Sea of Marmora.
3.

General Harington.,ilJlGAKOE OF     4.     LORD LEE stated that it had been suggested at thePAT I OH. OF itA , Cabinet that/ was necessary to Instruct the public as tothe significance of the Chanak position to secure thefreedom of tho Straits,    oeveral newnpapers which hadhot been unfriendly to the policy of the Government were now urging the abandonment of the chanak position.    Itwas clear that they did not understand the need for themilitary occupation of Chanak to ensure the freedom of navigation of the Straits,    They seemed to think that naval action would be sufficient to keep the StraitscpenskR* CHURCHILL remarliB d that there was now generalagreement that although the loss of Shanak would not.close the Straits to ships of war,  it would fatallycompromise the use of the Straits by merchant shipping.The freedom of navigation of the Straits cannot existwith the Turks in military possession, of the Asiaticshore of the Dardanelles,    He requested that the Navaland Military authorities should confer and draw up a brief communique, 400 to 500 words, explaining themilitary need for holding Qhanak*Whitehall Gardens,  S,W,1, ,25th beptember;  1922*-3 c.

Mr. LToyd George had drawn attentionto the passage in General Haringtonrs telegramNo. S451 of 85th September,, stating that one of mustapha kemal&apos;s conditions -for accepting the invitation to thePeace Conference was likely to be that British reinforcements are to stop.

In view of the area of operation this force should be  sufficient to have a consid-erable effect on any troops on the Asiatic shore within80 miles&apos; radius of Chanak provided, that good, &quot;aerodromes wereavailable In Gallipoli :    there v;ere also landing groundsandat Galata/Helles.      If the aerodromes in Gallipoli becamecongested the question of the use of Imbros for this purposebecame .an urgent one.      There was a possible further rein-forcement of 2 squadrons from Ireland but as these could notbe embarked, before -October-12th no steps had -yet been takenIn regard to them.The Quarter-Master-General said that in.the event of.operations, a base would probably be - required, at Imbrue Mudros(Lemnas)or Tenedos and that the Foreign Of&apos;f ice. had already-been con-suited as  to the possibility of making., use-- of these islandsif required. ,..Mr. Churchill referred to telegram&apos;Number ,245.1 .from -General Harington.      It - appeared that the meeting between general Harington and Kemal could not commence for another48 hours;    at this meeting no offer to suspend despatch of reinforcements should be made but Kemal was likely to demand,that no further British re infor cement s should - be despatched to the Near East as a.condition of his attending the projectedPeace Conference.      His. demand could hardly arrive before29th or 30th September and by this latter date practically all our available combatant reinforcements&apos;would be on the sea.We could accordingly&apos; offer thai no further fighting units would be forwarded from -British ports, except those already at sea,   and the names of the ships-conveying these, reinforcementscould be specified if desired.&apos;     It would be difficult to give guarantees that these/ &apos;-

CHURCHILL on the information available doubted the advisability of utilising a small flying columnand thought an entrenched position at Kum Kale mightbe more useful: he considered however that this wasa point which might be left to General--Harington.tehall Gardens, 8.W..y27th September,- 1922.-

$LAND.     1,      The Adjutant-General drew attention to thesituation which would arise in Ireland if it were necessaryto mobilise one or two divisions.      If one division weremobilised only 26 battalions would remain in Ireland (.1=6,4 short :of allotment), If two divisions were mobilisedonly 20 battalions would be left in Ireland (i *ee ten.short of allotment)..     Accordingly, if the Irish garrison weremade up to strength only two line battalions and four Guardswould be left In England.      If two divisions were mobilisedit would be necessary to withdraw the troops from eitherDublin or Ulster, for unless battalions were withdrawn from ireland both battalions of certain regiments would be abroad and these regiments would have no reserves to draw on.    Therewere, however,&apos;8 battalions- on the Rhine which might possibly be used If the French would agree,      lie also pointed out thatin t)ie event of mobilisation a large portion of the mechanical transport both personnel and vehicles in Ireland must perforcebe drawn upon.rlr. Churchill said lie did not wish to evacuateDublin on political grounds.     At present the ProvisionalGovernment were getting In such a strong position that he did not think it could become necessary to use British-troops in support of them, but if the British troops fromDublin were withdrawn he was afraid that it would givemuch encouragment to Valera and others to redouble their efforts against the Provisional Government.      Tiie Forcesin Ulster Could in no case be weakened,     &quot;He considered,however,  that this matter raised a broad question of policywhich would require careful consideration.     He suggestedthat in the event of mobilisation it would be necessaryto call for volunteers and also to make use of theterritorial force.      The whole question should be adjourned for further consideration.

2;&quot;MR. CHAMBERLAIN stated, that the meeting had &quot;been summoned in order to endeavour to elucidate certain navaland military aspects of the, situation before having afull meeting of Ministers at 7 p.m.MR. CHURCHILL read Telegram No. 466 from the HighCommissioner,  and SIR LAMING 7;ORTHINO-TON EVANS read aTelegram No. 2479 from General-Harington In which it isreported that he is now in touch with Kemal Pasha.MR. CHURCHILL asked the&apos;C.T.G.S. what his y&apos;iews; were as to the  situation which would arise if hostilities be-gan, in particular how long our troops could hold, Chanakbefore the arrival of reinforcements.:        ;.&apos;.-.*THE CHIEF OF TEE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF read TelegramsNcs. 2468 and 2469 which he had received from general harington.   . He was of opinion that the position which washeld at Chanak with a perimeter of four miles would not give- sufficient room for the landing- and deployment of alarge force there.      He was also doubtful if the trans-ports could reach Chanak if hostilities had begun.     Assoon as mobilisation was ordered, he was Certain thatKemal. would at once attack the Chanak position.      He didnot beliovo that he could turn our forces out of Chanakwhich could hold thoir own without reinforcements for three or four weeks, hut there was nothing to prevent &amp;ernalfrom bringing up guns to positions on the shore of the   &apos;Dardanelles from which they could fire up and down the&apos;Narrows.     That fire Y?ould prevent transports from
disembarking troops- in the;-BarrdaneXle s.    ^Tr^-roljnfxnxi-e----ment3 would therefore have to be landed on the NorthSide of the Gallipoli Peninsula and move across to Chanak.This would entail a very difficult operation and heavy losses would probably be Incurred in transferring troopsacross the Dardanelles.     An alternative plan was to di--vert the two divisions of reinforcements and land theni atsome place which must be kept secret as a counter offen-sivo.      He understood that it would be difficult forHis Majesty&apos;s Government to order the evacuation of theChanak position, but it was for consideration whether a force of one battalion would not be as effective as theforce that we now have In Chanak.      If, as appeared pro-bable, Kemal was unable to prevent his irregular troops from harassing our troops in Chanak, he could not prevent them from lining the shores of the Dardanelles with guns.It must be realised that if wo rf-o withdraw from Constanti-nople and Chanak that we have not sufficient forces toenable us to go back.      If it is  considered probable thatKemnl would loyally observe an undertaking for the igith-drawal of British and Turkish troops  alike from theneutral zone,  such an agreement would be to our advantage.If it were decided to evacuate Chanak now we might claim that our action was a &quot;beau gesta&quot;, and explain that oxirobject was to avoid the risk of a collision In view of thefact that Kemal cannot control his Irregular troops inthat locality.MR. CHAMBERLAIN observed that the proposals for with-drawal were based on purely military considerations, andhe was of the opinion that we could not now withdraw fromChanak with credit to ourselves in order to avoid Kemal^irregulars.     He would regard such a withdrawal as anhumiliation to the British Empire.
2 t$MR. CHURCHILL concurred in Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s view,and added that, if it were possible to ensure the immunityof the Neutral Zone&apos; by withdrawing from Chanak, we should accept such an arrangement at once, but he considered itto the last degree improbable that Kemal would consent to sacrifice the advantages he now had of access to theshores of the Dardanelles without firing a shot.LORD CURZON remarked that in Paris last week M.Poincare had urged that we should oonsent to withdraw from Chanak and had expressed an bpinion that Kemal would come to an agreement oh the subject.      The situation had changed sindo then.In reply to enquiries from Mr. Churchill as to themilitary position at Chanak, the CHIEF OF THE IMPERIALGEItfEEAL STAFF stated that, if fighting occurred at Chanakwithin the next 48 hours, Kemal would probably be able tobring artillery against the position in about four days1time.      There were now 3,500 British troops at Chanak.Reinforcements   -are due to arrive as follows:-2 Pack Batteries from Egypt due on the 28th.6&quot; Howitzer Battery from Gibraltar due on the 30th.1,000 Marines and a Signal Detachment due on the30 th.1 Battalion is due to arrive on the 3rd October.3 Battalions leave on the 28th and ara due on 9thOctober.The Turks are reported to have 7 Infantry and 4 cavalry divisions in. that locality, a forco of 23,000 rifles andsabre s.MR. CHURCHILL expressed the opinion that   GeneralHaringto^s last telegram was different in tone from his previous/
 previous ones. Up to now, he had been confident that he could maintain himself at Chanak for four weeks without difficulty.

THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF explained that there was no change in General Harington&apos;s view in regard to that matter, but he asked to be assured as to the reinforcements that would b sent if hostilities broke cut.

THE FIRST SEA LORD stated that the facts put forward by the Chief of the Imperial Staff would add to the difficulties of the Navy. He was of opinion that immediate withdrawal should be avoided if possible, as it would involve considerable loss of prestige. He considered that the Navy could assist in the debarkation of reinforcements at Chanak with the support of howitzers mounted on the Gallipoli Peninsula. He thought that the guns that might be mounted on the shores near Chanak as suggested by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff could be controlled by the fire of the Navy and the howitzers on the Gallipol? Peninsula. If Chanak fell, the Navy could keep open the passage of the Straits for Warships. There need to be no anxiety as to the withdrawl of the military forces from Constantinopole and Chanak. He had instructed the Naval Commander-in-Chief to take all measures necessary to ensure their safe withdrawal in case of need and he had no doubt carried out his instructions. His observations did not qualify in any way the Chief of the Imperial General Staff&apos;s view as to the difficulties of deploying a large force in the small position at Chanak where they would be landed on a beach overlooked by hills commanding the position.

MR. CHURCHILL remarked that it clearly emerged that the forces at Chanak could hold out until re inforcements arrived, and the Navy could ensure the withdrawal of  
of troops now there or that reinforcements can reach them if necessary, hut the difficulties of the operation are greatly Increased by.the new considerations which hadbeen put forward.     It was desirable not to exaggerate thepower of Kemal1s artillery.     It was true that he had some8M and 6&quot; field guns, but his supply of ammunition was probably limited and the difficulty of transporting the ammunition across broken country to the shores of theDardanelles must be very great.     If necessary, reinforce-ments could be landed at Buiairj marched along the gallipoli Peninsula to opposite Chanak and ferried acrossto Chanak..     There should be therefore no difficultyin getting reinforcements to Chon&amp;fc if it is desirable todo so,     lie enquired if it is certain that General Haringtoncould not held the two high hills commanding theChanak position,      He suggested that if General Haringtonknew that reinforcements would be sent to him that he might be prepared to do so.     He suggested that that question should be put to General Harington and that heshould be told that lie might move troops from Constantinopleto Chanak for that purpose if he thought it necessaryaHe enquired If it would bo more humiliating for us to evacuate Chanak now or to repulse the Turkish attack and if need be withdraw   pending the arrival of reinforcements.He enquired, assuming a serious collision takes place on 1stOctober, and orders were given to mobilise, what intervalwould elapse before the reinforcements began to arrive0THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GEFERAL STAFF read an appreciation of the situation prepared by the GeneralStaff on the assumption that our troops in the Chanakposition are attacked on the 50th September and that the
the attack was repulsed, and that orders for mobilisationwere given on the 2nd Octoberc He explained that rein-forcements would, arrive as followsBy the 7th October, 5 more Battalions,By the 15th October, 2 Pack Batteries, and one Batteryof 6*&apos;&quot; Howitzers *After that there would be a gap until the 23rd October whenthe mobilised troops would begin to arrive.      The whole of the infantry of the 1st Division woiild have arrived by the 30thOctober and the whole Division by the 3rd November.     the infantry of the 2nd. Division would have arrived by the 3rdNovember and the complete Division by the 7th November.      Itwas proposed to .expand the position at Chanak as reinforcementsarrived..MR. CHAMBERLAIN requested that the Naval,. Military.and Air Chiefs would consider the Naval, Military and Airaspects of the situation as now disclosed in readiness fora meeting of the Cabinet at 7 p,m.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff was authorisedto consult General Harington as to whether it would not bepossible to hold the two high hills commanding the position at Chanak.. *Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,27th September, 1922.
