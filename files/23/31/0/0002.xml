GREEKO-TURKISH SITUATION.

(1) With reference to Cabinet 48 (22) Conclusion 1, the Cabinet met to consider the latest developments of the Greeko-Turkish situation. The Meeting began by a review of the facts of the present situation.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR produced a map showing the position of the British and Turkish Forces on the Asiatic side of the Straits and the Sea of Marmara. General Harington, he said, had reported that he could not hold Constantinople for long unless he could also hold the opposite shore of the Asiatic side of the Bosphorous. The Bosphorous varied in width from 600 to 1200 yards, and if the Turks occupied Scutari they could bombard Pera and Galata and knock them to pieces. Sir Laming Worthington Evans then pointed on a plan showing a line some 15 miles in length, covering the southern half of the Bosphorous, as well as Scutari, which had been drawn up some months before by the Commanders of the Allied Forces for covering Constantinople on the Asiatic side, and set forth the following Forces.

The abo^re schorl * however, had been ^rwup on the assumption that the Greek Army was holding the hulk of the Turkish A^ray and wasconsequently Inadequate to the present situation.A disturbing factor in the present situation wasthat a certain number of irregulars had crossed the Bosphor/Sua in small numbers and two divisions of Turkish irregulars (about 3,000 rifles perDivision) had been forme-1 on the &apos; uropean side and some troops would have to be held bank to .deal with those*&quot;111e-Turkish Foroes which could most readily be made available for the attack of this, positionamounted to 950 sabres and 12,000 rifles with .28 field and 2 machine guns, ih   addition to BOOsabres and 7,400 rifles, a short dlstance South ofthe Gulf of Iamid\, making a total of 20,000 troops which could be coneentrated probably within a fortnight for on atiaeK on the Isinid\ position.Against this the Allied forces amounted to about600 sabres and 7,000 rifles with 28 guns, 12 tanks and 12 aeroplanes.   1-hls force was totally insufficient for- holding the proposed line under present conditions.The question was.raised at this point as towhether it would not be possible to prevent thepassage across the Bosphorpus of small numbers of turkish Forces anft the First Lord of the Admiraltyexplained that the Navy would not be able to prevent this by means of small craft patrols if they wereexposed to fire from the Turkish side,      The Beer?of-State-for-^ar, continuing, said that 2 Pivlsio-were required to hold Constantinople.
As regards the present position at Chanak,there were at present 3^- British Battalion^ anda quarter of an Italian Battalion.     The French had agreed to send a small Force hut it had not yet arrived.     The French had in addition 1 Battalion onthe Gallipoli Peninsula.The Turkish Forces which could most readilyhe brought into operation against Chanak eonsistedof 1,000 sabres and 4,000 rifles with 20 guns.   Xnaddition the Turks had 40,000 rifles in the Smyrnaarea.An Officer from the General Staff at Constantinoplewas now In London and could give the Cabinet any detailed information they required.During the Secretary-of-state&apos;s explanationthe Cabinet were reminded that the french Governmenthad expressed their willingness to join the Britishand Italian Governments in informing the angora government that the Allied Governments expect thatthe neutral zone will he respected hy their troops.s
3JSB SB8B&amp;TABY. Of STAfS FOE Ir OKBXGw AFFAIRS thendescribed the recent developments of the general andpolitical situation.     She Greek retreat was now complete,and a telegram had been received from Athens to the effectthat there was now no need for an armistice, as the evaoua-tion of Asia Minor was complete.     In addition to leavingSmyrna, the Greeks had also left Brusa.     Whether or not itwas due to the representations made to the Greek Government,he was glad to say that Brusa had been left intact, and itwas now in the hands of Mustapha Kernel&apos;s. forces.     the greeks bad retired to the coast at Panderma and Mudania,and their forces were being transferred to Eodosto.     thus the situation in Asia Minor had been cleared up.     he regretted to have to report that the Greek Army in theirretreat, as often happened when armies were in retreat, had left behind them a trail of bloodshed.     Their troops had now been- withdrawn, both from Smyrna and Ohesma, to whichports they had retired.     The naval Commander-in-Chief atSmyrna, Admiral Brock, as frequently happened in the caseof naval officers in difficult situations, had done particu-larly well.     A curious incident had occurred at Smyrna,tshioh at one time had appeared very menacing.     mustapha kemal had met, apparently fortuitously, the British Consul -General, Sir Harry Lamb, and &quot;had told him that he could not recognise him as he was at war with Great Britain, and hehad threatened to intern the British Colony.     AdmiralBrook, who had previously had an interview with loureddinPasha in command at Smyrna, and had found him a sensible man,had then written to Mustapha Kemal and asked him to state inwriting if it was true that lie regarded himself as being at war with Great Britain.     Mustapha Kemal had then recededfrom his position and had written a civil letter, in thecourse/
*J 1course of whieh lie had. used the following phrase:-   &quot;That   jthe two Governments sight well establish political relations in accordance with the usual procedure&quot;.     There was a pointon which he would like to consult the Cabinet.     The naval ICommander-in-Chlof had loft, but there was a senior naval   jofficer still there, and the British Consul-General was stillon shore.     He would like to send a telegram to Sir Harry.  IXiamb or to the Admiral, or perhaps to both, to the effectthat there was no objection to entering into relations wtt&amp;Mustapha Zemal on matters of detail without discussing thelarger political issues, since Mustapha Semal was de factoin control at Smyrna.Mo objection was made to Lord Curson&quot;s proposal.THE SBOSBSABY OF STATS FOE PCE1IGI AFFAIRS then passed to the position at Chanak and&apos; Scutari.     He recalled that attheir previous meeting the Cabinet had felt some doubt as to$nether their Allies could be counted on to help hold theposition at chanak and Scutari, if attacked..     Consequently,instructions had been given authorising General harington to withdraw the British foroes if he thought necessary.General Harington had been rather discouraged at what heand the High Commissioner, Sir Horace Rumbold, regarded asrather premature action.     Accordingly, General Haringtonhad been told to hold either position, except in the caseof military risk.     It was true,as had been mentioned bythe Secretary of State for War, that 48 hows before general harington had reported that the French had not yet senttheir contingent to chanak, but In view of a message received that day from Paris (Paris telegram Mo. ^3 )stating that theFrench Government were ready to Join the British and italian governments in informing Angora that the Allied Governmentsexpected the Meutral one would be respected by their troops^.he/
ho felt no doubt as to tbe position of France, and a fortiori.&amp;  that of Italy.Some doubt was expressed as to whether the existenceof a small Inter-Allied force would deter Mustapha Kemal,who was flushed with victory,from sweeping the Allies intothe sea, If he thought they were divided in council, weak,and not in a position to reinforce their troops.     On theother hand some doubts were also expressed as to whetherMustapha Kernel would commit such an act of folly.Continuing, the SECESTARY 01? STATE FOE FOREIGNAFFAIRS said that since March he had been trying to arrange5for a meeting between the High Commissioners of the Allies,and the belligerents, for the purpose of explaining the paris proposals.     All kinds of difficulties and objectionshowever had been made, more particularly as regarded theplace   of meeting.     Eventually, it had been agreed that ameeting of the High Commissioners with representatives ofthe belligerents should be held at Venice, when the high commissioners should explain the Paris terms, and endeavourto secure an armistices     but it was never contemplated that they should draw up a Peace Treaty.     This meeting had now lw^l$e-unneoeesary, as there was no armistice toarrange, the evacuation of Asia Minor being complete.The Italians/
6 the Italians, however, appeared to wish to convert theVenice Conference into a Conference for the settlement ofpeace in the Kear East.     The French were rather disposed to take the British view, that the Venice OTonference was now unnecessary and had sent a hesitating reply to theItalians statins? that they would consult the BritishGovernment.   He himself was averse to a meeting at Veniceor on Italian soil.   He thought it would be a blow to the prestige of Great Britain who had been mainly concernedin the defeat of the Turks and who had great interests at stake to have to meet the Turks in a country which merelyhad commercial interests in Turkey, and which had taken no part in Turkey&quot;s defeat.   He also gave reasons resultingfrom his experience at Paris in March which led him to thinkItaly was not the best country for this particular Conference.Consequently, he was opposed to going to Venice or Rome.The question of where the meeting should take place also raised the question of when.   He thought it should takeplace Immediately without a moment&apos;s delay, and he was re-inforced in this view by the dangers in the present situationpointed out during the discussion.   He further thought thatthe meeting should be attended not by High Commissioners,but by representatives of the Powers, who should meet assoon as possible, and within a fortnight.   This raised thequestion of who should be invited to attend.   HithertoConferences of this kind had been attended only by represent-atives of the Great Powers, Great Britain, France, Italy and japan, as well as occasionally by Belgium in cases where shewas specially concerned.    In no case connected with thehadEast Bxct any other Powers had a seat at the Conference, though of course, interested Powers had been heard.     When it came to....
to the signature, however, the Treaty of Sevres had been signed In nHinliil 11jlrrji tin representatives of Armenia, Belgium,Greece, tJae-4loajag9 Poland, Portugal, Roumania, Serbia andGaeeho-Slovakia9 as well as by the Great Powers and Turkey.All the above Powers had a technical Interest In the peace settlement but to invite them all to a Peace conference would be to render the procedure very difficult.   Consequentlyhe only proposed that those States should foe invited that were specially concerned.   This included. Roumania who wasvitally &amp;^6c^&amp;d and to whom a seat had been given on. theCommission for the Control of the Straits contemplated fnthe Treaty of Sevres.   Tugo-Slavia was also concerned;Bulgaria was interested but she had not been a signatory tothe Treaty of Sevres and had been an enemy State.   Consequent-ly he thought it would suffice that the Bulgarian represent-ative should be heard^ and his proposals therefore were -First, to hold the Conference as soon as possible,and secondly,to ask the French and the Italians to agree to inviteRoumania and Yugo-Slavia.The Treaty of Sevres had been drawn up in Londonand had been completed at San Remo, but he thought it wouldbe unwise to Insist on our claims that the new Treaty shouldbe drawn up In London.   The Turks would think they were coming into a pro-Greek atmosphere in London.   The choicetherefore lay between Italy and France.   On the whole, Inspite of the obvious drawbacks, he favoured Par-Is, alwaysassuming that some agreement was reached with the Frenchbefore the Conference took place.    In this event he thought the Turks would be more amenable at Paris than elsewhere,, andfee recalled that in spite of the unfavourable circumstancesan agreement had been reached at Paris in March.   Moreover,better arrangements could be made for a Conference in a greatcapital..../o
capita. 1 like Paris than elsewhere.Supposing that the Conference was held and that itwas found impossible to reach agreement in regard to Thrace,in that eventuality the only alternative appeared to be reference to the League of Rations,   He did not think thetime had yet come for the Powers to hand over their responsi-bilities to the League of nations, for though the Leaguepossessed great and increasing moral authority, it had no material force behind it.   However, if agreement could not bereached at Paris he thought the only plan was to refer tothe League which had earlier been asked to undertake an inquiry into the alleged atrocities in Turkey, and more recently hadbeen asked to take up the protection of minorities.   Moreover,Lord Curzon recalled that before the Paris meeting he had obtained the approval of the Cabinet to a proposal that theLeague of Nations should be asked to undertake responsibilityfor the neutral zone on the European side of the Dardanelles,and it was only owing to the opposition of the French Governmentthat he had not been able to carry this proposal.   Hence asa last resort he proposed reference to the League of Nations.Referring to the Thracian question, LORD CURZON said,that two telegrams had been received by the War Office in which general j&amp;irington had reported a conversation alleged to havetaken place between Ha%m d Bey, the representative of Angora atConstantinople and the French and Italian High Commissionersat Constantinople, in the course of which both High Commission-ers were alleged to have expressed felte- uncompromising view thatthe whole of Eastern Thrace should go back to Turkey.   In replyto Lord Peel, he presumed this included Adrianople.    It had also been alleged that the High Commissioners had consideredthat the Turks would he justified in sending troops across theStraits into Thrace.    He wished to express some doubt as to the accuracy///
9, f*accuracy of this Information, and he recalled a previouscase in which, the Commander-In-chief had aatriolpatod-trouble in Constantinople when the information had proved to be atfault.   The Cabinet were however Informed that general harington&apos;s report as to the attitude of the two high commissioners was confirmed by reliable information from several sources,LORD CDRZOU having completed his general statementsaid, that what most disturbed him was the view taken byGeneral Harington and Sir Horace Rumbold, that the securityof the Straits depended on the occupation of both sides.When he had gone to Peris in March, the Admiralty had wishedfor the control of the Asiatic shore of the Dardanelles aswell as ofi the Gallipoli Peninsula, but the War Office had notinsisted so strongly that It was necessary to hold both sides,and be had merely pressed for the occupation of Gallipoli.Now, however, he understood that it was necessary to holdboth sides of the Dardanelles and Bosphor^us.   This meant that a successful General flushed with victory had to be heldoff from both positions if the Allied policy was to be carriedoff.    Of course If Mustapha Kemal would accept the neutral zone no further difficulty would arise, but this was uncertain.Consequently the military situation was of great importance.If the position could not be held, it was no use trying tosecure it.   Further, if Constantinople were handed back tothe Turks it would be very difficult for the Allies to hold the position with a resuscitated Turkey.   All this appearedto render it the more important that the British Governmentshould confer with the French Government In regard to the -Conference, and he himself was prepared to pay a visit toM. Poincare for the purpose.   Moreover, he consideredimmediate action essential.    He had drawn up a memorandum. y, not....
not for textual communication to the French government but as the basis of a conversation which the british ambassador might have with the French Government.
In subsequent discussion the view was expressed that in spite of the great authority of Lord Hardinge,the questions at 4ssue were of sufficient importanceto Justify Lord Curs on himself visiting 11* Poincare.,As regards the place for the meeting of theproposed Conferences the general view of the cabinet was that it would be better not to run the riskof incurring odium in Italy by proposing that theConference should be at Paris instead of at Venice.At the same time, If the French Government took thespontaneous initiative in proposing Paris instead ofVenice, the suggestion should be acceded to.     Allusionwas made to the hostile attitude which Italy had taken up towards the policy advocated by the British Governmentin regard to peace in the Hear East, but the cabinet were reminded that Italy had always been quite openlyopposed to our policy  as Italian policy was stronglyanti-Greek.2HE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES drew atten-tion to the urgency of the military sitiiatlon accordingto the information disclosed at this meeting.     The mis-fortunes of the Allies were probably due   to the factthat owing to the delay on the part of America in declar-ing their position, their armies had apparently   meltedaway.     Moreover, the Greek army had been used in a half-hearted way.     The policy of the Allies had been neitherpro-Turkish nor pro-Greek,with the reaa.lt that the greek army had neither been supported nor opposed.     He hopedtherefore that no claims would be made on the Turkswithout a sufficient backing of fore,   to support them.It was true that the claims were being reduced, butiteven so, the first thing that/was necessary to do was
to ascertain what forces were available to support thoseA.claims.     It was useless to depend upon the mere skeletonforce maintained at Constantinople by the three Powers,one of -whom was already refusing to send any additionalforce, or to leave the High Commissioners and Generalsto do the &quot;best they could to cope with the situation,without reinforcements.     If the situation was to hecleared up, the Government must be prepared to statewhat support they were prepared to give*     He was whollyopposed to any attempt to carry out a bluff without force.He thought the Government were justified in insistingthat the Straits should be kept open and in refusing tobe thrown out of Constantinople, even up to the pointof having to maintain the position by force.     This wasnot an impossible position to sustain.     liberal opinion would be a good deal influenced by the recent atrocitiesand conservative opinion would not be willing to seethe British flag ta*amp3?e&amp; on.     Consequently, so longas the Government was acting in conjunction with France,he saw no objection to aotion for the limited objects 3icwproposed.     He thought therefore that lord Curzon shouldbe authorised to tell M.Poincare that he was prepared to reinforce the British force in the Constantinopleregion by a division, provided the French Government ?/erealso prepared to send a division.     In reply to lord curzon he said he did not contemplate this as a permanentarrangement, but merely to meet the present emergency.These forces would be available for holding the Chanakposition as well as the Seutari position..As regards the proposed Conference, he shared thegeneral view of the Cabinet as stated above.     He agreedthat the smaller Powers proposed by Lord Curzon shouldbe invited to attend, but only on condition that they
would produce a contingent to meet the presentsituation in the Straits.     He thought that Greece ,Serbia and Roumania should all contribute forces for holding vital points pending the assembly of the Gon-ference.     Shis would be to confront the Turkish forces with sis flags instead of three flags, -which was initself something of a league of Nations.     At any rate,he was convinced that Belgrade, Athens and Bucharestought to be approached on this question *THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that more than ayear ago Roumania had been ready to send a force ifnecessary.     No country had &apos;an interest in the freedomof the Dardanelles comparable   with that of Roumania.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TEE COLONIES, continuing,said that the first point was that it was vital, pendingthe assembly of the Conference, to gather together asufficient force to hold the water line.     This would beto put a force behind our diplomacy.     He hoped that later the Secretary of State for War would state ho^this^ force could be obtained.Another important point was that the British Govern-ment should in future confine themselves to Britishinterests.     However fatigued it might be he thoughtthat the Empire would put up-some force to preserveGallipoli, XV ITH the graves of so many of its soldiers, andthey might even be willing to do this without the co-opera-tion of France.     As regards Thrace, however, therewould be a grave danger if the British Government wereisolated and depicted as the sole enemy of Islam.     Oursafety in this matter was to keep as close as possl blewith France.     He thought we ought to obtain as much aswe eould for Greece, but we ought not to be placed inthe position of being the sole and isolated champion oflb
Greek claims.2HE LORD PRIVY SEAL agreed that diplomacy ought tohave some force behind it and he therefore favoured the despatch of reinforcements and the bringing in ofother Powers which were vitally concerned.     He thought,however, that they must show their willingness   to strike a blow for their vital interests.     What was required,ho?/ever, was to keep open the route to the Black Sea,not^ merely for the present but for the future.     Was itclear what was necessary for that?    Previously the argument had been that if we held Gallipoli we could sendforces into the Marmora, that these forces could dominateConstantinople and so dominate Turkey,     Was this true?We were now at Constantinople and we did not appear tobe able to dominate Turkey.     She Birkish Government could go to Bru^sa or Angora.     Before embarking on this planhe would like to know whether we were to hold the positionin the Straits permanently ossSssM. it was clear that a division could only be sent for a month or two.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE CQLOMIES said his proposal only provided for the present emergency, but hecertainly did contemplate some INTERNATIONAL onal force in theneutralised zone which would hold some position at Chanakand Ismid as well as at Gallipoli.     He saw no reason why this should not be under the League of Hations nor whyultimately, particularly if Russia recovered, the inter-national force should not be paid for by dues from theshipping.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said his reason in raising thequestion   was that he did not want the British representative at the peace Conference to make a stand for something whichwas not of any great value.
The suggestion was made that Mustanha Kernel: might deem it inadvisable to place himself indirect opposition to all the Powers by attacking the Straits.     He might prefer to give lip service to the policy of Freedom of the Straits, and,regarding Great Britain as his principal enemy,ACTION IN turn his attention towards Mesopotamia and&apos;MESOPOTAMIA.Palestine where the allies of Great Britain wouldnot mind what happened^Clt was suggested that at any moment someformidable demand of this kind might cams fromMustapha Kerneli   It was pointed out, however,that if Mustapha Kernel thought he could get theAllies out of Constantinople hy attacking   Mesopotam-ia, he was making a great mistake.     The british forces were only remaining at Mosul as a rear-guardand if they were attacked it would afford a good opportunity to slip out.     In view      theaction of the aerial Forces in Mesopotamia, it would. &quot;he a long time before the Turkish Forces coulddescend the Tigr^s% from Mosul, and whatever action the Turks took it is unlikely that troops would he asked for in Palestine.   As regards Palestine, theTurks could not reach it without crossing territory under French mandate. -THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOE INDIA said thati m Indian feeling would.not, he thought, he somuch disturbed by fighting the Turks in Mesopotamiabut it would be very unfortunate if it became necessary to fight the Turks elsewhere and might involve trouble on the frontiers and withAfghanistan.   What would be far worse, however,would he to fight and he beaten.     Consequently/he strongly
he strongly supported the proposals for strengthening the Allied Forces in Constantinople area.THE PRIME MINISTER also strongly supported the despatch of reinforcements.   &amp;e had already communicate with the Foreign Office and before theCabinet had. $ad a few minutes&apos; conversation with theForeign Secretary and he was convinced that theAllied Forces must not be driven out of their positionnor run away before Sfustapha Kernel.     Apart from this we had a supreme interest in the Freedom of theStraits.   Mosul and the Tigrtls^ Valley were reallyof no account as a British interest.   It was arguableas to whether we ought to remain theins at all and hewould like the Cabinet to discuss this question atan early Meeting,   he would not allow himself to bedeflected at all by this consideration.*       Whethera Division was the right force to send to Constantinoplewould have to be discussed, but whatever the forcehe felt we must be in sufficient strength.     He was entirely opposed to approaching the French government as a suppliant for assistance.     Ha felt that i*p to now the Government had not played all the cards theyhad in their hands.   The Foreign Secretary had, un-fortnnately, been away for some months and had notbeen in control at the Foreign Office during theperiod, subsequent to the Paris Meeting in i%roh*Nothing, however, had happened which was inconsistent with the Paris arrangement.   The Greeks had voluntarilyevacuated Asia %nor, for, so far as he could judge,there had been practically no fighting.    To what extent were the Allies really dependent on France?/Roumania and
Roumania and Serbia had a keener Interest inthis question than even Great Britain.   More thana year ago RoumaniA-had been willing and anxiousto send a Division, if necessary, as the lateM,.Take Jonesou had t$ informed hiss..     The settlementof those questions was a matter of life or death to roumania who ought, he thought, already to have been approached.     He had seen very little official information from Bucharest or Bulgaria.     He had read in the Morning Post that the Yugo-Slave Govern-raent did not want the Turks back.   The same appliedto Reumania.   He thought immediate communication should be made to these Governments.     They should notbe asked merely for a Brigade, but what force theywould be prepared to send.     It should be pointedout that the situation was more vital to them eventhan to ub.suggested that they should also he asked within whattime they could send the Troops.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said the Foreign Office had bean in close touchfilth Roumanian and Serbian Ministers *     The Roumanian; Minister^ had told the-Foreign Of floe that his country took a great interest in the question andhe had been informed that the British Governmentwould like to have Roumanians support.   The feiinister$,of course, had not been in a position to promise -.support but^faithless sanguine than -fee Prime^Hnister as to obtaining auoh 8ttggoi*t andofrecalled that M*Take donesctt^had been s strongpro-British proclivities.   / $he Roumanian ministers the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE c&quot;LOUIES
. had &quot;been told that if there were a Conference theBritish Government would support an invitation forRoumania to he represented.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed fetes with the previousspeakers that a Peace Conference without force behind the Allied diplomacy would only he another of the series of paper conferences.     hQ thought, therefore,that immediate touch should be established with theSerbians and Roumanians who should be asked what theywere prepared to do.   Steps should also be takento ascertain what the Greeks were prepared to do.   Theymust have several Divisions available.     Combiningthe Greek, Roumanian Serbian and British Forces, aconsiderable Army would be available.     Mustapha Kemalought to know that if he crossed the Straits with60,000 rifles he would be met by 60,000,- to say nothing of the British Fleet.     The time had come to do somethingconcrefte.       He did not dispute that some temporary arrangements of the kind indicated night lead to apermanent arrangement for the guardianship of theStraits.     For some time he had taken very little partin this question because he did not wish to interferewith the Foreign Office, and, in fact, he-had avoidedany communication with the&apos;Greek Prime Minister at genoa.,   He was now expressing himself merely as amember of the Cabinet.     He did not wish the british representatives at the Conference to he In the positionof having to throw themselves at the feet of M.Poincare.He had received information that very day to the offsetthat M, Poincare was dissuading the Yugo-Slavi^f Governmenttaking action.        Consequently he thought that activesteps ought to be taken at once with the Roumanianand Serbian Governments./in reply
In reply to a question by Lord Curzonbe said he did not wish to make any immediateproposal as regards the permanent occupation ofthe Straits but he thought that a permanentInternational Garrison might perhaps grow out ofa temporary arrangement and perhaps the whole might &quot;be placed under the League of Nations *THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs pointed out that the Yugo-Slave Government was not likely to take aetfon for nothing and would ask her &apos;price,THE PRI!.!E MINISTER pointed out that the Yugo-Slavic interest in the question.was even greaterthan our own.   Anyhow it would be useful to know what her price was.LORD OtTRZON agreed that Roumania*s interest wasvery great but      was doubtful as to that ofSerbia.THE MINISTER o? LABOUR asked whether in theevent of Mustapha Kemal coming forward with ademand for the Straits there was any doubt as towhat the French answer would be.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that France wouldbe influenced by the attitude of Roumania and Yugo-Slavia.   The CHecho-Slovakian Government would be boundto stand in with Roumania and Yixgo-Slavia, andcons equently France would be influenced in that direction.     He doubted if it was worth while for lord Curzon to see M.Poincare unless he had behind .his proposed diplaraacy some backing force such ashad been suggested.     It ought to be possible to/obtain
obtain replies within a very few days.

LORD CURZON warned the Cabinet against building too enthusiastically on these proposals.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES said he would put it to the States mentioned that it was proposed to have a Conference in the near future, that they would be represented on it, and meanwhile they ought to take their share in securing the position. It might also be useful to give a hint that not a word had hitherto been said to Bulgaria who might perhaps be glad to co-operate.

The Cabinet were reminded that Bulgaria was in communication with Mustapha Kemal.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL pointed out that if Bulgaria could get into close touch with the Allies they would soon drop Mustapha Kemal.

THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND suggested that Australia and New Zealand ought to be asked to co-operate.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR supported the idea that if a reinforcement were sent it should be Imperial in character. He pointed out that the mobilisation of a Division entailed calling out some of the Reserve. The only way to avoid this was by having extraordinarily weak Divisions.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES deprecated the idea of calling out Reserves. He pointed out that the Irish situation indicated that troops were not likely to be required. He was not suggesting to take troops from Dublin, though the time might come to consider this before long, but he thought it unnecessary to hold troops in readiness to proceed to Ireland. /THE SECRETARY
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR undertook to examineclosely the means by which a Division could he sent with-out calling up Reserves.     He thought it would inevitably be a very weak Division composer] of only about 7,000 men.The Cabinet were reminded that the King and PrimeMinister of Yugo-Slavia were at present in Paris and thesuggestion was made that Lord Hardinge should be askedto see him and explain the whole situation, inviting hisco-operation.
THE SECRETARY 01? STATE FOR WAR thought it possiblethat a Division could reach Constantinople in less than three weeks.   He then read a telegram which had justreached him from General Harington( M- ).The question was raised as to whether the eo-opera-tion of the United States of America might not be sought.Tt was recalled they had large missionary interests inTurkey.     The general view, however, was that in view of previous experience such representations would not be like-ly to prove of value.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said there were a battalion and two batteries at Malta and another battalionat Gibraltar, which could rapidly be transported to Con-stantinople as transports with reliefs for India would shortly be passing those ports.The Cabinet agreed that these two battalions andbatteries should be sent to Constantinople.THE PRIME MINISTER proposed that the Secretary xesof State for Foreign Affairs should be authorised to informM. Poincare when he met him, that the British GovernmentHere prepared to send a division to Constantinople, if theFrench Government would do the ssame.This was agreed to.THE SECRETARY OF STATE F0B1AR   asked if he was tomake preparations to send a Division.    If so, it would atonce become known as he would have to stop leave and makeother preparations, which cotxld not be concealed.THE PRIME MINISTER thought this was unnecessary forthree or four days, although all possible preliminarypreparations should be made to reduce the time as much aspossible, if and when the decision was taken.   He thoughtthat men should not yet be recalled from leave.       Ifnecessary/If
If necessary men on leave couia be despatched afterwards.THE SECRETARY of STATE foe the COLONIES suggestedthat the Air Ministry should be asked to send two SquadronBfrom Egypt.THE SECRETARY of STATE FOR WAR said this would take5 weeks.     There were at present 5 seaplanes at Constanti-nople, and he understood that in the course of the next fewweeks these would be raised to 15 aeroplanes.     The diffi-culty was that seaplanes were unable to defend themselves against fighters, and consequently it was important to haveaeroplanes.At this point THE PRIME MINISTER read a note he hadreceived from Mr. Sylvester, who had been informed by arepresentative of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; of a conversation he had had with the Charge&quot;-&amp;&apos; affaires of Serbia in regardto the Turco-Bulgarian situation, in which the Chargd-d*affaires had expressed the anxiety of his Government inregard to the situation, and had said that the Jugo-SlavGovernment were opposed to the Turks coming back to Thrace.There was similar information in regard to Roumania.     Hewould, therefore, urge that instead of sending a despatch to Lord Harding^ an emissary should go from the ForeignOffice to put the whole position to him and to explain thedecisions taken by the Cabinet&apos;that day, so that LordHardingcin seeing the King or Prime Minister of Serbia,might be fully cognisant of the situation.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES urged that a message should also be sent to Bucharest.     The main point to make was that Great Britain was prepared to take actionherself, and was about to notify the French Government thatshe was prepared to send an additional Division;    the states concerned should then be asked what forces they were preparedto send/
to send, and it should be implied, that if they sentforces, it would give them a seat at the Conference.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL suggested that the Secretaryof State for the Colonies should also send a telegram tothe Dominions asking if they would send a battalion.SEE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES said thata telegram would be sent by the Prime Minister, but hewould be prepared to draft it.The question was then raised as to whether therewas any objection to information leaking out as to thedespatch of reinforcements.TEE PRIME MINISTER thought that it was inadvisable to make any definite statement, but there would be no harm if it leaked out that preparations were being made.THE SECRETARY of  STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS asked what answer he was to give when asked where the forces were to be sent.TEE LORD PRIVY SEAL suggested that the reply shouldbe that the troops would not go beyond the Neutral Zone,and the Prime Minister suggested that the Governmentsconcerned should be told to send a representative toGeneral Harington to make the necessary arrangements.TBE SECRETARY CP STATE FOR THE COLONIES suggestedthat the troops should be placed at the disposal of theAllied Commander-In-Chief.THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OF WORKS pointed out thatthese countries would require a loan.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said the right reply to a request for a loan was that each Government should pay for its ownTHE SECRETARY 01&apos; STATE for FOREIGN AFFAIRS asked ifhe was to tell the French, that the British Government would send a Division, even if they would not.It was/
It was suggested that it w uld he premature to decidethis question until replies were received from Serbia andRoura&amp;nia.THE SECRETARY 03? STATE FOR TEE COLOHIES again raised the question of sending to Constantinople two of the 7 or 8Squadrons that were available in Egypt.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL suggested that the Air ministry should be told that the Cabinet wished two Squadrons to besent, and w Uld like to know the shortest time in which theycould reach Constantinople.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TEE COL OKIES suggested thatthe Admiralty might perhaps be able to expedite transport.THE PRIME MINISTER said this was a question for dis-discussion between the technical experts ox the Admiralty andAir Ministry.     He then suggested that action ought to betaken to ascertain what the Creeks can do.     He proposed thata telegram should be sent to the British Minister at Athens,and another to the General Office Commanding Constantinopleto obtain information on this point.     Information shouldalso be obtained as to what transport was available to theTurks for crossing the Straits and. the Sea of Marmora.THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that the naval commander-in-Chief had this matter in hand, and had orders to prevent the Turks from crossing.THE PRIME MINISTER urged that, nevertheless, steps should be taken to find out what facilities the Turkspossessed-.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES expressedanxiety as to the feeding of Constantinople.     He was uncertain whether it depended on Asia Minor.   As there were more than&apos;amillion people in this region, it might present a serious problem if there were a military front across the line ofsupply.
JTHE SECRETARY 03? STATE FOE WAR made a note toascertain this.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat his idea as a result of this meeting was that he should offer to go over to see M. poincare during the fallowingweek;    that Lord Hardingc.should approach the King orPrime Minister of the Jugo-Blavha Government;   that theForeign Office should approach the &quot;Roumanians;    and that lord Harding should make no communication to the FrenchGovernment until he himself went to Paris. . He was ratheranxious about the movement of troops, which might possiblyprecipitate action by the Turks.     If M. poincare should say that France ?/would  not send a Division, was he to saythat the British Government would act alone?THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought it was premature to make this answer.     By that, time it was hoped, that a reply would have been received from Serbia, Roumania, end theDominions.      If they all refused to send troops,, then thesituation would  be very difficult.TBE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS asked what troops it was anticipated Roumania would send.THE PRIME MINISTER said he would hope for a Division.At the end of the meeting the SECRETARY OF STATE FORWAR read a telegram which he had&quot; gust received from Field-Marshal Lord Plumer     $ despatch^from Constantinople.(fau6The Conclusions of the Cabinet are attached.
