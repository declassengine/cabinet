3. Considorable stress was laid by tbe Cabinet ontbo importance of further publicity to the Government&apos;policy in regard to the situation in the Hear East,Resentment was expressed at the attitude of part of theprose in throwing on to the British Government the blame for the secrecy which had been preserved in regard tothe Prime Minister1 a statement to the parliamentary committee of the Trades Union Congress on Thursday,September 21st.     The Cabinet were informed, that in theearly part of the meeting before they had heard theGovernment8 s case, some of the members of the Doptitatioinhad made very extreme speeches threatening strikes andlabour difficulties if tho Government3s policy should lead to war, and that, after&apos;hearing the Prime Minister&apos;estatement, the members of the Deputation had themselvesagreed that in the national interest full publicity weeundesirable.     Tho decision not to publish the report had been taken jointly by both Bides.The Cabinet unanimously approved the proposal ofthe prime Minister to see the press the same morning, and make to them a full statement of the Government&quot;s policy.Among the points inhioh the Prime Minister was asked toemphasise wore tho followingr-(a) That the British forcos at Chanok weromerely ensuring the carrying out of thearmistice with Turkey which the turkish nationalist Forces throated to break;(b) That tho British attitude wae not in the smallest degree based on a desire to take up tho   cudgals on behalf of Greek interostein Thraqe or elsewhere;(a)     That the terms of the Proclamation issuedby General Harington warning the TurkishNationalists to avoid the neutral zone,were the same as those which he had issuedwhen the Greeks were threatening Constantinople;(d) That/
That the 1st cation of the BritishGovernment should be made clear,to retain ChanaJc for tho two following essential purposes:-fi) The maintonanoo of tlS freedomof thfe Straits;fit) To prevent the ,War Spreadinginto Europe.
1 THE HEAH EAST.Form of invitation-tation toMustapha Kemalto a PeaceConference.Lord. Cura on * snegotiationsin Paris.-4.       With reference to Cabinet 49(22) Conclusion 2(e),the Cabinet had before them the following telegramsreceived the same morning from the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs in Paris in regard to his conver-sations with II. Poincare :-I(a) Lord Hardinge*s telegram Ho.472 datedS3rd. September, 1922,  (CP.4215)* \. &apos;)u(b) The draft of an invitation to the Angorax   Government to the proposed Peace Conference.(CP. 4214).After full discussion the Cabinet agreed
p r(a) That as the discussion would occupy some considerable time the Foreign Office should telephone to lord curzon in Paris warning him that the Cabinet&apos;s replymight not be available by 2 p.m., and should suggest to&quot;him that he should ash M. Poincare to postpone the meeting until 3 p.m.(Sir William Tyrrell sent instructions to theForeign Office to this effect during the meeting).(b) That it must be recognised that the policy originally^,adopted by the Allied end Associated Powers at the paris Peace Conference, according to which the Turkscould not be trusted in future to rule races aliento them in nationality and religion and should infuture be confined to the government Of purelyTurkish peoples, had failed (except so far as related to the Arab races) owing to various causes *     Thesecauses included more particularly the refusal ofthe French to take a mandate for Cilicia; the refusal of the United States of America to accept a mandate for Armenia;   the withdrawal of the Italians fromAdalia; and the inability of Greece to maintain her position in Smyrna and the defeat of her army.In these circumstances it would be advisable to avoid any phrase which might be construed as committing the British Government to the moral responsibilityfor the inevitable change of policy in regard to eastern Thrace, and it would be preferable to face the^^acts of the situation by merely stating thatthe$ ware prepared at the coming Conference to meetthe desire of the Government of Angora for the return of Eastern Thrace including Adrianople to Turkishsovereignty,.(c) That it should be made perfectly clear that effectiveguarantees for the security, protection and the enjoy jmerit by all Mat ions of the freedom of the watersbetween the Mediterranean and the Black Sea was in-dispensable.(d) That it should also be made clear that adequatesecurities were necessary for the protection of racial- and religious minorities generally.-
(e) That the two objects in (c) and (d) were bothattainable under the League of &quot;MatIons, whoseagency the Government of Angora had already declared their willingness in principle toaccept.(f) To approve the telegram to Lord Curaon reproduced in the Appendix,which was drafted during themeeting and was based on Lord Curaon&apos;s draft re-ferred to above modified in accordance with theabove considerations; and that the Foreign office should immediately despatch it to Lord Carsonon behalf of the Cabinet.(g) That the Foreign Office should also immediatelyinform Lord Curzon in a separate telegram thatin the event of its being found impossible tosecure agreement with France and Italy on. theBritish text, the Cabinet considered it wouldnot be injurious to make the above communicationseparately and directly from Great Britain tothe Government of Angora.(h) To approve a Foreign Office proposal that the.Foreign Office should further notify Lord Curzoyurimmediately in a. separate telegram that.beforethe Mote referred to in (f) was despatched., the &quot;assent of Roumania and Serbia should be Secured.If France and Italy should definitely declinethis, Lord Curzon was to be authorised to yieldwhile recording a protest against a refusal to consult Powers which were so vitally interested.IIOTB.    The Cabinet on the proposal of the Prime Minister decided,in addition to the above, that Lord Curson should beashed,in the event of a failure to reach agreement, tosuggest the reference of the whole question to the Leagueof Hat ions, and the Lord Privy Seal and the Secretary ofState for the Colonies undertook to draft a telegram on reconsideration he and the Secretary of. State for theColonies had felt considerable doubt as to the expediency of suggesting this, as the &quot;Council of the League of nationsmight very probably be induced by the French Government to insist as a condition of the Conference, that the british forces should leave Chanak, the holding of which theBritish Government considered vital to securing the freedomof the Straits and the prevention of the war spreadinginto Europe.     The Prime Minister, and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, who was with him, concurred in this view and the telegram was not sent.
5 aTHE SECRETARY OP STATE FOE WAR informed theCabinet ,that tbe foroes now at Chanak consisted, of4 Battalions of Infantry, four 4*5 Howitzers, and four 18 pounder guns.In view of a telegram from tbe Naval Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean read by the First Lordof the Admiralty to  the Cabinet, in which AdmiralBrock described the difficulties to which the Uavywould be subjected in fulfilling its responsibilitiesunless both sides of the Straits were held.    (see conclusion&quot;? )The desirability was pointed out of strengtheh-ing the chanak position still further.     It wassuggested that the relative deficiency of the british forces in numerical strength might be compensated toa considerable extent by increasing their mechanicalresources in armament and equipment, and more partiou-larly by augmenting the number of guns on theCallipoli Peninsula for the defence of Chanak.In this connection attention was drawn to a telephone message sent by the Prime Minister on theprevious afternoon to Sir Maurice Hankey, (appendix to the Conclusions of the meeting of the Committeeof Ministers on September  2nd at 5.30 p.m.) and tothe Conclusions reached at that meeting.The further suggestion was made that ifpersonnel was the difficulty, it might be possible toman an additional number of guns by utilising the more highly trained men for the more technical duties withthe medium and heavy artillery, diluting them with less highly skilled men for the less skilled duties.THE, SECRETARY/
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR informed theCabinet that the Turkish nationalists were reportedto have  15 gens of all calibres, as well as 178 gunscaptured from the Creeks.     Little was known of their supplies of ammunition, but he agreed that theseprobably could not be on a scale comparable with those employed on the Western Front in the Great War.     TheWar Office he said had telegraphed to General Haringtonexplaining the position, and asking if he would beglad of additional medium and heavy artillery if itcould be made available.; The Cabinet agreedThat the Committee of Ministers whichhad oiet at the Colonial Office on theprevious day and. was composed ofThe S/S for the Colonies,Tho First Lord of the Admiralty,The S/S for War,Sir Maurice Hankey, Secretary,with such experts as were required, should meet immediately further to consider thequestion of the provision of additionalmedium and heavy artillery for general harington&apos;s Command.
6.        The attention of the Cabinet was called to atelegram from the Exchange Telegraph Company&apos;representative in Athens published in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; of even date, which recorded, the visit of a Commission of French Officers accompanied bya high Turkish officer to Chanak to inspect the warmaterial concentrated there in 1920 by the Inter-Allied Commission charged with the disarmament ofTurkey, which v/ar material it was alleged was underthe protection of a Greek military detachment.The Cabinet requested the   --Secretary of State for War tomake enquiries as to whether there was any truth in the allegation that this war material was under the protection of aj Greek military detachment.fo

Vessels are forbidden to be under weigh by night and are seized if discovered to disobey order. When Kemalists cross neutral line all transport will be removed to European side this can be done in a few hours. Marmora. Transport consists of a few steaners and many caiques at the various ports Captain D 7th D F. with 4 destroyers at Pasha Liman watch coast from Gemlik to Chardak with orders to turn back any craft carrying troops regulars or irregulars. Clearances to Marmora nationalist ports are being refused at Constantinople and Chanak. Unlikely that Kemalists will take this route to Thrace when Kemalists cross neutral line transport will be sunk or collected at Pasha Liman this would take 2 or 3 days depending on destroyers available. Bosporus packed with many hundreds of craft of all descriptions and sizes. No measures taken at present to interef? with traffic at request of military and diplomatic chiefs. If it is intended to hold Constantinople and Ismid Peninsula all these craft could be driven into Golden Horn when Kemalists commit hostile action. This would take severely days and would gravely upset life of community. Ferry service to Islands is a special source of anxiety as these craft would make excellent transports and Kemalists have been in ?(corrupt) ferry steamers I am watching these steamers carefully. Black Sea which is not mentioned in Admy message is a difficult matter. Two destroyers are now watching Thracian coast as it is reported that motor caiques are transporting small bodies troops from Ineboli and other ports to Bulgaria. Situation in Chanak. Your (b) At Chanak ships are stationed for affording support to military and ground lends itself to this help. Navy can prevent Kemalists crossing from Asia to Europe in Marmora and Dardanelles provided that in the latter case military can keep batteries back from the shore by counter battery work.

REVISED DRAFT OF INVITATION TO ANGORA GOVERNMENT.

As suggested to Lord Curzon by the Cabinet on 23rd September 1922).

British, and French Foreign Ministers and Italian Ambassador in Paris desire to invite Mustapha Kemal to come himself or the Grand National Assembly of Angora to send a representative with full powers to a meeting at Venice or elsewhere to which will also be invited plenipotentiary representatives of France, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, Yugoslavia, Roumania and Greece. The meeting will be held as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made by Italian government and the other governments concerned. Its object will be to negotiate and draw up the final treaty of peace between the allied powers and Turkey and among other things to mediate a settlement of the outstahding points in dispute between Greece and Turkey.

The British, French and Italian governments desire at the same time to take this opportunity of declaring that they prepared at the coming conference to meet the desire of the government of Angora for the return of Eastern Thrace including Adrianople to Turkish sovereignty. These efforts will be directed in this matter only to secure guarantees for the protection of the interests of the neighbouring states, and the peaceful and orderly re-establishment of Turkish authority. It will be necessary, however, for the conference to  reach agreement 

upon two further points: first, effective guarantees are indispensable for the security and protection for the enjoyment by all nations of the freedom of the waters between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea: secondly, adequate securities are necessary for the protection of racial and religious minorities generally.
Both these objects are attainable under the League of Nations whose agency the government of Angora have already declared there wililngness in principle to accept. The allied governments re-affirm the assurances  which they gave in March last to withdraw their troops from Constantinople upon the entering into force of the treaty of peace.

The allied powers are prepared while the arrangements for the Venice conference are being made to use all their influence to the procure the withdrawal of Greek forces behind the line of the Maritza provided always that the government of Angora undertake pending and during the peace conference not to enter the neutral zone or to attempt to cross the Sea of Marmora.

For the above purpose a meeting could be arranged without delay between the allied generals and Mustapha or Kemal at Mudania or Ismid.

That theSecretary of State for the Colonies shouldorganise the necessary staff arrangementsfor ensuring this and that in particular,he should prepare a       suitable reply tothe telegram from the Prime Minister ofAustralia dated 20th September, fro.17,CP, 4200.(j) That the War Office should send to General Haxingtonas from the Cabinet, a telegram to the follow-ing effect :-Informing him that a summary of thepolitical situation as disclosed by LordCurzonrs discussions at Paris was beingtelegraphed separately to Sir Horace Rumbold;       &apos;that this would indi cate the importance ofany action which might uiareeaBsarily precipitatehostilities;    that a revised programme of troop movements, showing the earliest possible date at which the reinforcements, which theGovernment were expediting, could arrive,was being telegraphed;    that both these telegrams should be borne in mind in considering this message.      That the Cabinet thought itdesirable for General HaringtonTs guidance,axed subject to his better judgement, to setforth the relative importance that was attachedto the various positions committed, to hischarge.     That the foundation of British policyin that region was the Gallipoli   Peninsulaand the freedom of the Straits.     It was of thehighest importance that Chanah should be heldeffectively   for this.     Apart from its military importance, Chanak had now become a point ofgreat moral significance to the prestige of theEmpire,      It would be regarded as a valuableachievement if it could be held.     A blow at chanak would be a blow at Great Britain alone,whereas, Constantinople and Ismid v/ere of inter-national consequence, affecting the whole of theAllies.      In comparison with Chanak, the Cabinetregarded Constantinople as second and Ismid asthird,     She JJemalists would probably not attack the Ismid position.      Should they do so and reach the Bosphorus, the Admiralty had declared thatthey, could still prevent the transport into europe of the nationalist army.     if they bombardedPera&quot;j the Navy could retaliate on some convenientTurkish area.      The Ismid Peninsula was regarded by the Cabinet as at once the roost difficult tohold   and if lost, as tho least fatal.4t the proper moment it might be well that general harington should withdraw his troops from Ismidand even from Constantinople to Chanak, thussecuring the latter position on an adequate front and in good time.      Trie Cabinet had sufficientconfidence in the General !s jxidgment as to whetherand when such a concentration at Chanak should bemade.     Should he decide on the above considerations
That the Admiralty should be authorisedto notify the Naval Commander-in--chief in the Mediterranean that measures toprevent the transport of Turkish Nation-alist forces to the Marmara Islands orto the European Shores of the starits and the Sea of Marmara should not bei*egarded as provocative action.&quot;
and in all the circumstances that there was agood chance of holding Chanak for two or threeweekis, the Cabinet would cordially approve sucha decision.     The decision in regard tomobilisation of the two Divisions at home wasbeing   deferred until, the development of the nestphasd in the situation.      General Haringtan was authorised through tiie High Commissioner tomake to Mustapha Eamal any notification thatmight be necessary with the object of securingChanak,     FoUtexample,; he could warn him againstentering the neutral sone in this region, andthat, should ho do so^ he would be fired on if he used the roads along the sea coast to approach the positions held by General Ha rington1stroopsi     The form and soope of such warning was left to the General.     General Harington was totake all the above as a guide rather than as an instruction as   the Cabinet had the utmost con-fidence in his comprehension of the whole position.     He was instructed to show a copy ofthe telegram to the Naval Commander-in-Chief,(Paraphrase of telegram actually sent).(k)   She Foreign Office were instructed to transmitthe above telegxam^iromediately to Lord Curia on inParis,2, Whitehall Gardens,        S.W./1&apos; 21st September.1922
