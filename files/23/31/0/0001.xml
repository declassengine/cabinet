THE GRECO-TURKISH SITUATION.

1. LORD CURZON explained that we had been working up to the present situation since last March, when he had negotiated in Paris an agreement signed by all the Allied Powers. The failure to give effect to that agreement was due to the consistent treachery of France. The French Government had been in constant communication with Kemal and had urged him to pay no attention to what had been agreed to at Paris. Delays were first caused owing to the difficulties made by France in arranging for a meeting to discuss the terms for an Armistice. Later on further delay was caused by the proposal to establish a commission to enquire into the atrocities committed by the Kemalists against the Greek population. Again the French threw obstacles in the way of the enquiry. It had been finally agreed that the enquiry should be conducted by the Red Cross Society, but the French had refused to contribute their quota to the cost of the enquiry.

The Greeks had been for some time contemplating the contraction of their front in Asia Minor to a line nearer to Smyrna. It was regrettable that they had not undertaken that operation sooner. The recent Turkish attack had taken place in circumstances unfavourable to the Greeks. The Greeks had seen that the Powers were disunited and had thereupon threatened to advance upon Constantinople. The transfer of troops to Thrace with that object had weakened their front in Asia Minor; and at the same time they had foolishly proclaimed the establishment of an autonomous province of Smyrna. The withdrawal of the troops and the issue of the proclamation gave the Kemalists their chance and they seized it and advanced against the Greeks. It was not clear whether the retirement of the Greeks was involuntary or Whether/


whether the Greek Government had connived at the withdrawal of the troops. General Harington had recently expressed the opinion that the Greeks might make a stand in the neighbourhood of Smyrna. It now appeared that there was no possibility of resistance by the Greek Army; and refugees were now pouring into Smyrna in large numbers. Our immediate pre-occupation was the maintenance of order in Smyrna. The Turks had had enormous advantages through receiving military equipment and arms in large quantities from France and Italy. The Greeks, on finding themselves in a dangerous position, had now approached the British Government with the object of obtaining an armistice on the basic of the complete evacuation of Asia Minor. It was desirable that the fighting should be ended as soon as possible; but it was inexpedient that we should set alone, both because it was desirable to avoid raising suspicions in the minds of our Allies, and also in view of the risk of the failure of such a demarche. He had communicated the request of the Greeks to Paris and to Home and had suggested that the High Commissioners should offer their good offices. That proposal was practicably rejected by the French, who had imposed the impossible conditions that the High Commissioners should not intervene unless the Greeks gave an undertaking that the troops withdrawn from Asia Minor would not be sent to Thrace and that the Greek troops in Thrace should be withdrawn behind the Enos-Midia line. These conditions in fact prejudged the whole political issue. No reply had yet been received from the Italian Government. The reply of the French showed that an Allied representation at Constantinople was out of the question. He was of opinion that we ought to follow the advice of our High Commissioner and recommend the/
the Greek Commander to approach the Kemalist Government with a view to obtaining an Armistice. The Kemalists would, no doubt, put forward impossible demands to the Greeks, but that would not be of great consequence, as time would be occupied in clearing up the situation in Asia Minor and the Kemalists were at present incapable of bringing pressure to bear on the Greeks in Europe. It was possible that the Turkish Army would be in Smyrna within a few days. Thousands of Greek refugees were pouring into the city. British warships had arrived at Smyrna and arrangements had been made for the evacuation of British subjects in Malta and Cyprus. He requested that the Board of Trade be asked to consider the possibility of sending some British ships to Smyrna to remove refugees. He had also asked whether the American Relief Organisation would assist the refugees in Smyrna. Reports had been received that the Greeks in their retreat had been killing the Turkish population, and he had warned the Greek Government of the serious consequences of such excesses. It must be remembered that the province of Smyrna had a large Greek population, and with a Turkish Army flushed with victory their position would be one of great danger. He had requested the League of Nations to take up the question of affording protection to the minorities in Asia Minor. The League of Nations would probably ask that they might be provided with the means to enable them to undertake that responsibility, and we and our Allies would be appealed to to provide the necessary means.

These matters were, however, only on the fringe of the large questions of policy with which we were now confronted. The question was whether evacuation of Asia Minor by the Greeks involved the abandonment of the European part of our policy. Evacuation of Anatolia was not
a new thing. It had been part of the Paris agreement last March. The European part of that agreement included the return of the Asiatic shore of the Dardanelles to the Turks, the retention of the Gallipoli Peninsula in the military occupation of the Allies and the retention of Greek sovereighty over Eastern Thrace and the handing over of Constantinople to the Turks. He was of opinion that the failure of the Greeks in Asia Minor was no reason for the abandonment of our policy in Europe, but we could not count upon the French and Italians to adhere to the Paris agreement which they signed last March. He earnestly hoped that we should not abandon the Gallipoli Peninsula or at present abandon Constantinople to the Turks. He considered that European questions could only be solved by the European Powers as a whole, and not by the British, French and Italians alone. Many Powers had signed the Sevres Treaty and the signatories of that Treaty were vitally interested in the fate of the Straits. He proposed that a conference of the European Powers who signed the Treaty of Sevres should be convened to decide as to what should replace that Treaty. The French, no doubt, desired to reinstate the Turks. That solution would never be accepted by the Roumanians, and if we consented to it the whole of the fruits of the war as to the Balkan situation would be thrown away.

Lord Curzon then read telegrams which he had that moment received from Mr. Bentinck and Sir Horace Rumbold. (From Sir Horace Rumbold No.390 of 7th September and No.388 of 6th September, and from Mr. Bentinck No.384 of 6th September.) Sir Horace Rumbold&apos;s telegram showed that he had succeeded in persuading his colleagues to make a demarche
-  demarche in regard to an armistice which the French Govem-ment had opposed.     It was necessary for us to await theresult of that demarche *   As to Constantinople, there wasa fear that the Kemalist Army might advance and threaten the Isfflid Peninsula and Constantinople.     He was doubtful,however,  if Xemal would venture to threaten Constantinople.The difficulties of conveying a force across the bosphorouswere considerable *     Constantinople was now he 3d hy French,Italian and British troops, and the last thing that theFrench would agree to would be to our being left alone in constantinople.      here was, therefore, no likelihood ofthe French and Italian troops being withdrawn from Constanti-nople at present.     On the other hand, the Kemalist troops will not readily be brought into opposition to the Frenchand Italian, troops.     He therefore considered that the dangerof Constantinople from a political point of view was not serious.      It was possible that there might be a rising ofthe Turks in Constantinople;    but General Harington believedthat he could suppress such a movement with the support ofthe French and Italian troops *      It must also be rememberedthat there were 400,000 Greeks in Constantinople and thatwhen they had withdrawn their troops from Asia, Minor theywould, be stronger in Europe.SIE ALFRED MOID suggested that the Turks would not agree to an armistice except on outrageous terms, and,if these terms were not accepted, they would -proceed to destroy the whole Greek Army.     He enquired what course weshould take then.ME. GHUKCHILL was of opinion that we ought not to bind ourselves to any bargain with, the Turks to ensure the safety of the Greek Army which would in any way compromiseour European policy.     The Asiatic arrangements should bekept/

against a great Sea Power like ourselves ana if it were inthe occupation of a groat sea Power it would be impregnable.He considered that the suggestion&quot;of the secretary of Statefor the Colonies as regards Bulgaria to be a valuable one,hot an insuperable difficulty in the way was that the roumanians and Yugc-Blaviana are bitterly -hostile to the bulgarians.   He considered that it was possible the Crooksunder the new caamander-in-Ohief may fight and improve thesituation.LCPD LBS stated that, during Ms recent visit to constantinople, he had formed the opinion that our prestigethere was far higher than that of the French or theItalians.   The &quot;forks say that, while the French constantlygive them information as regards the action of their allies, they never, received from as information as to our allies.   We had only 1,000 men in the Ismid Peninsulaand it is probable that they would be withdrawn to helpin maintaining order in Constantinople.   He believed thatour&quot;fleet at Constantinople would be sufficient to deterKernel from attempting to take Constantinople,   The gallipoli peninsula wee occupied by French and Italian troops. &apos;There were no British troops there, although we had asmall detachment of troops at Chanak on the southern shore.He considered it desirable that there should be some british troops in the Gallipoli Peninsula, as it waspossible that the French might surrender the &quot;Peninsulato the Turks.tfR. CHUHCHILL suggested that the Chief of theImperial General Staff should bo asked to furnish a report as to the military consequence of the evacuation of theIsmid Peninsula.THE PRIMS alBISTSB stated that, if the Kerneliats
ma&amp;e an attempt on Constantinople, the British Fleet should certainly fire on them, just as we had informed the Greeks thatthe British Troops would oppose them if they attempted to. advance on Constantinople,     We should he strictly impartial in thematter.     He considered that the danger that the French mightsurrender the Gallipoli Peninsula to the Turks should he met by strengthening our naval forces by a patrolling flotilla,.The Cabinet agreed s-(1) That while using every effort to bring hostilities between Turks and Greeks to a speedy end theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs shouldcontinue to base his Near East Policy,on theAgreement concluded by the Allies in Paris inMarch last.(2) That the maintenance of the control of the deep seawater separating Asia and Europe was a cardinalBritish Interest, and any attempt by the Kemaliststo occupy the Gallipoli Peninsula should be resisted by force:(3) That the naval forces in that region should be In-__^____*----erellu38ia^;j y^c^f-^A       with the object of preventing Kemalists gaining-f access to the Gallipoli Peninsulat(4) That some British troop^^shoUjld occupy the gallipoli peninsula along with the/troops now stationed there,and the Secretary of State for War should concertthe necessary arrangements with the Commander-in-Chief, Constantinople, by transferring Britishtroops from Chanak, or a battalion from Malta, orotherwise;(5) That in the event of the Kemalist forces making anattack on the Ismid lines, which are at the presentmoment held exclusively by British troops, theCommander-in-Chief should be at liberty to withdraw the latter to Constantinople, but that any attempt on the part of Kemal to cross the Bosphorus and attackConstantinople should be resisted with the full etrergftiof the British forces by sea and lands(6) That a joint report should be prepared by the WarOffice, Admiralty and Air Ministry on the policy tobe followed in the event of Constantinople and theIsmid Peninsula being menaced by the Semalists; 0(7) That the President of the Board of Trade should con-si der the diversion of British ships to Smyrna to takeaway refugees, other than the British subjects who arebeing removed by the Admiralty.0 NOTES...A&apos;he Acting Secretary has since been informed that a plan for thedefence of Constantinople has already been prepared by theGeneral Staff in consultation with the Admiralty and Air Ministry.
*Tm-: .    10IdjpSR-ALLIED     2,     With reference to Cabinet 46 (22), Minute 1, the&apos;%xS AMD&apos; ,IPARATION.       Cabinet had under consideration a Note from M. Poincare(CP.4182) in reply to Lord Balfour*s Note of August 1ston the question of Inter-Allied Debts and Reparation.The Cabinet were informed that In the view of sir john Bradbury, M. Poincare&apos;s Note was intended to divertpublic attention from the real issues. &quot;   The cabinet were impressed with the offensive tone of the second partof the French Note in which undue emphasis was laid uponVarious accounting matters between the French and british governments including a suggestion that France had beenovercharged by the British Government for consignments of foodstuffs and materials supplied during the war by theaddition of overhead charges and export duties.     Itwas suggested on the one hand that it would be more inconformity with the dignity of the British Government topass over the allegations in silence, but on the otherhand It was held that to do so would cause the UnitedStates, of America to think that the allegations werefounded on substance.     It was also suggested that the reply to M. Poincare should consist of two documents:the first, a general reply on the question of Reparationand Inter-Allied Indebtedness 5   the second, a detailed examination of the accounting questions raised in M,Poincare&apos;s Note.     In relation to the allegation thatoverhead, charges and ex-port duties were included, it was stated that possibly 1 per cent had been charged incertain eases as out-of-pocket expenses, and that the sanecourse had been followed by the United States of America.No duties of any kind had been included.     It was believed to be the fact that the accounts had already been agreed with the French Authorities and it was pointed out that ifthis were the case the reply to M. Poincare would beImuch simplified.The attention/
The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to thenecessity for exercising great care in the preparationof a reply in order to ensure that the statements in itwere incontestable, and oould not form the basis of controversy.     It was pointed out that if the replywere to be accompanied by an accounting&apos;statement oon-siderable delay would be incurred.     If an accountingdraft had to be prepared some 15 Departments would haveto &quot;be consulted,, which would take at least a month *She Cabinet agreed -(l)    &quot;That before coming to a decisionon the question of principle asto the form, if any, which the&apos;reply to M. Poinoard1s Mote shouldtake, a draft should be submitted,of the kind of reply which it was proposed to send;(2) That the Treasury should submit tothe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs a draft of a reply based onthe facts as ascertained, and thatthe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should circulate the draft reply to the Cabinet for early consideration.
CONTROL OP SALES   3.       With reference to Cabinet 40(22) Conclusion 7,OF ARMS ANDAMMUNITION. the Cabinet had under consideration a memorandum bythe Secretary of State for War (CP.4180) on thequestion of the control and sale of arms andammunition in which the Secretary of State for Warasked the Cabinet to allow responsibility for giving effect to the policy of the Cabinet in the matter of sales of warlike stores to rest upon the Departmentsconcerned who will exercise their discretion in referring the more important questions concerningthe sale of arms to the Cabinet..It appeared that it would be impossible tocarry out certain bona fide negotiations for the saleof munitions of war to the Japanese, Dutch and SerbianGovernments if the Cabinet decision above referred towas strictly adhered to.The Cabinet agreed;-That the responsibility for giving effect,    ^ ,   -  . to the fee policy/in the matter of sale oftkt. ^- ^/kWw- warlike stores should rest upon theu Departments concerned who should beauthorised to carry out negotiations forthe sale of such stores to foreign powers in. proper eases as suggested in thememorandum from the Secretary of Statefor War - and that Departments should exercise their discretion in referringthe more Important questions&quot; concerningthe sale of arms to the Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.TC.1.7th September, 1922.

Safeguarding of Industries Act (Fabric Gloves), the Con-abric Gloves.ference had a short discussion on the present position.The Prime Minister read letters which he had received on the subject from Sir William Edge and&apos; a Unionist member for a Lancashire constituency.    The Prime Minister summed up the discussion by stating that the Government would stand firm on its present position, though it might bedesirable to consider afterwards whether it was worth while to include in the list of articles to which the Act wasapplied, manufactures of small intrinsic importance.The President of the Board of Trade stated that inregard to certain articles this had already been dealt with.The Prime Minister undertook to see .Sir William Edge in regard to his letter-. *

Poincareyproposed to see the PrimeMinister in regard to the first question. M. Poincare had.treated the second question as though it were entirely sseparate subject.   After the Allied representatives on the clearing-house had been assembled in Paris, Mv Poincare had written a separate reply to the Germans stating that if. the payment was not made sanctions would be applied by theFrench Government.Lord Dal four pointed cut that it was very desirable...for the Prime Minister to sec M. Poincare before August15th, when the next German reparations payment was due.We had always protested against independent action by the-French.    If, however, Germany defaulted on August 15thand we had refused M. Poincard&apos;s proposal for a consulta--tion, our case for protesting against independent action would vanish.    In these circumstances he thought Monday,August 7th was the latest date at.which the meeting oughtto he hold.    He mentioned that ho himself would be leavingLondon on Friday next.The Conference .agreed  (a) That the Acting Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should tell the french ambassador that the Prime Minister agreedthat there ought to be a discussion withM, PoincarO before August 15th;    that theBritish Government had always attached importance to  the presence of representatives
