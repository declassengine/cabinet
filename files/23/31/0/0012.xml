SITUATION IN THE NEAR EAST.



The Paris Negotiations.



1. With reference to Cabinet 58 (22). Conclusion 1, the Cabinet had under consideration a telegram from Lord Hardinge dated October 7, 1922, giving an account of the meeting on the previous night between The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and M. Poincaré, and telephone messages from Lord Hardinge dated 12 Noon and 1-30 p.m. on October 7th, containing the account of the further meeting between Lord Curzon and M. Poincaré that morning. For the text of these documents see Appendix I. General Harington&apos;s Telegram No.D-6, of October 7, 1922, was read out.

The Cabinet proceeded to discuss the formula which the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had proposed to endeavour to get M. Poincaré to accept, and particularly the following:-

"In the territories thus evacuated the Allied Governments will ensure by means of a provisional inter-Allied occupation the maintenance of order and public security during the thirty days after the evacuation by the Geek troops which will be necessary for the instalment in Eastern Thrace of the Turkish administration and Turkish Police."

In the course of the discussion it was urged that at the present time the Turk was "anti-foreigner". According to secret information, it was clear that the French Government were anxious about the future safety of the French subjects in Turkish territory and about the rights of the French holders of Turkish debt. It twas probable that at the forthcoming Conference the French Government would be much less inclined to support extreme Turkish claims than at the moment, and in particular it seemed inopportune for the British Government to press at the moment the question of what protection the Peace Conference should extend to the non-Turkish population. There were, however, certain grave questions arising on the proposed formula. In the first place, neither the formula proposed by M. Poincaré nor the Secretary of State&apos;s modification


 of that formula placed any limit on the number of Turkish gendarmerie to be maintained in Eastern Thrace. In this connection it should be remembered that the Turkish gendarmerie would in all probability be the Kemalist Army under another name. In the second place, there had apparently been a complete change of view regarding the subject-matter of the inter-Allied occupation. The original proposal had been that this inter-Allied occupation, which was to endure until after the Peace Treaty had been signed, should be concerned with those parts of Eastern Thrace which it was proposed should ultimately be restored to Turkish rule. The new formula, however, apparently contemplated that after the expiration of a maximum period of one month an inter-Allied occupation should take place of those parts of Eastern Thrace which it had tentatively been proposed to assign to Greece. Lastly, and most important of all, it would be necessary to emphasize in the most emphatic way that the British Government could no party to any new agreement which did not contain a binding assurance relative to the evacuation by the Kemalists of the neutral zones and the due observance of those zones in future.

It was pointed out, however, that the proposal that the Allied troops should continue to occupy during the Conference certain points on the right bank of the Maritza probably had reference to the question of Kara Agatch and to the desirability of stationing Allied troops at certain points on the new frontier where disturbances would be likely to break out.

Doubts were expressed whether the period of one month after the evacuation by the Greek troops, during which inter-Allied occupation was to be in force, would be 
Sufficient* bat ia this- connection it was pointed out thatM4 Venizelos himself had only ashed fox- this period^, hehaving adopted the policy of the evacuation of the non-$turkish population of Eastern Thrace on the lines indicatedin the message from the Greek Minister in London to theSecretary of state for Foreign Affairs dated October ?,1922.^ for the terms of which See An nerd lx I1aEmphasis was also laid on the necessity for imposing a limit on the number of the Turkish... gendarmerie *   The allied troops would be scattered about in Eastern Thrace in smalldetachmentsg and it was out of the question to contemplatetheir being surrounded by large numbers&apos; of Kemalistgendarmerie*It was then urged that the Cabinet should reply tothe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs expressingentire concurrence with his Insistsacs that agreement on every other point should be contingent on the Alliesjointly requiring the Kemalists to withdraw from the Beutrsl ones.     Secondly, that the Cabinet fully shared lordCur2on&apos;s objections to the terms of the formula firstsuggested, which would result in the transfer of lest emThrsee to Turkish rule before any precautions had beentaken for the protection of the son Turkish inhabitants.-The Cabinet would like to secure some such delay ms was contemplated in Mm Yenizelos* telegram (See above.     Xathe third place any proposition for the admission intoEastern Thrace of the Turkish gendarmerie before theexecution of a definite Treaty of Peace must comprise a limit on the numbers of that gendarmerie without whichthe latter would be merely Mustapha Kemalfs army tinder
another name, and would &quot;be a constant source of danger to the occupying troops.     The rsumber of the gendarmerie should befixed by the Allied Generals at Constantinople in consultationwith the High Commissioners.      It was most important to bearin mind that, contrary to the wishes of the British Government,the first topic of discussion at the liiudania Conference hadbeen Eastern Thrace and not the Meutral Zones.    It was alsomost important that M. Poincare should be clearly informed thathe must accept the Paris note as a whole, and that it was not open to him to adopt those parts of the Mote which he favouredand to reject those parts which he disliked.I4ote.   At this point in the discussion a further messagereceived from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs by telephone, was read to the Cabinet.   This message was as follows :*-MLord Curaon and M, poincare have agreed to the followingformula in place of that contained in Part I of the message received this afternoon:The three AlliedGovernments agree in accepting that theGreek troops shall be invited to retire as soon as possibleto the West of the Maritaa.In the territories thus evacuated the Allied Govern-ments will ensure by moans of provisional inter-allied occupation the maintenance of order and public securityuntil the establishment in Eastern Thrace of Turkishcivil administration and gendarmerie.This installation shall take place within a period not exceeding a month after the evacuation of Greektroops.   At the expiry of this period, the allied troopsshall only continue to occupy during the conference certain points on the right bank of the Maritza and the places where they are at the present moment.Kota. As M. Poincare leaves for the country at 4 p.m. Lord Curzon would like a replybefore then as to whether the Cabinetagrees.&quot; 3?The suggestion was made that this new for nail a was in such*   Hote by the Secretary. - At 3.4? p.m. when it was realised that the reply would require further consideration, theSecretary under instructions from the CabinefyOh behalf ofthe Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairssent a messenger to the gabbbacfc Private Secretary of the latterasking him to telephone to Lord Curzon in Paris suggesting that he should request M, Poincare to remain a little longer in Paris.
general terms that its interpretation might hereafter lead to serious troubles and difficulties. Moreover, under this formula the Turks would be in material possession of all that they could reasonably expect to get in Europe at the very time when the Conference would be sitting. It was essential that, if this formula was to be approved, the conditions respecting the evacuation of the Neutral Zones and the limitation of the number of the Turkish gendarmerie should be insisted upon. On the other hand it was urged that the latest formula probably represented the best terms which the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had been able to persuade M. Poincaré to accept. In some respects these terms were better than had been expected, and the wise course would be to give Lord Curzon full discretion to make the best settlement he could. This formula should be read in conjunction with the formulae contained in the immediately preceding passages. Failure to agree with the French would mean a breakdown of the Mudania Conference; Allied evacuation of Constantinople; a Kemalist invasion of Thrace, with consequences far worse than the acceptance of the alternative policy recommended by Lord Curzon.

Doubts were expressed as to the wisdom of accepting the French point of view after our recent experience of French diplomacy. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had gone to Paris to demonstrate to the French Government in the clearest possible manner the point of view of the British Government, but it would seem from the latest telegram that it was proposed to surrender on  


guest ions of principle which, up to the present, theBritish Government had refused to give up.    If greatBritain conceded the latest formula, she would obtainnothing in return, and the way to secnre^pe&amp;ee was not to sacrifice everything which was regarded as essential inthe national interests.
Some discussion then took place as to the reply whichshould he despatched to lord Curson* s latest message, andit was suggested that the reply should state that theBritish. Government would accept the latest formula, on thedistinct understanding that Great Britain would be no partyto pressing for a Greek retirement from Eastern Thraceunless the conditions respecting Turkish withdrawal fromthe neutral zones, a limit on the number of Turkish gendarm-erie In Eastern Thrace, and satisfactory arrangements madefor the protection of the non-Turkish population ofBast em Thrace, were secured,HhUe a draft telegram was being typed, the attentionbearing the signature ofof the Cabinet- was directed to the terms of the KoteyKl.clemenceau, which had been addressed to the Turkish Delega-tioh at the Paris Conference (W.O.B. 1044) e   It was pointedout that G-reat Britain was the only nation which had eon-sistently carried out the views of the Supreme Councilregarding the Turks as expressed in this document.(At this point the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff entered the room.)After some further discussion, the Cabinet agreed -(a) That the Under-Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should arrange for thedespatch by telegram, telephone,, and byhand, of the following message to LordGurzcn:-&quot;We have considered carefully your final formula.The Cabinet accept this formula provided that M,poincare&apos; on his part accepts the following conditions,:-(l) That agreement on any other point mustbe contingent upon Turkish withdrawal from, and respect for, neutral zones.(S) That any agreement for admission ofKemalist gendarmerie before conclusionof Treaty of Peace must contain a limit on the numbers of such gendarmerie,failing which it might easily becomein fbet the Kemalist army under anothername and endanger the position of theAllied occupying troops.   The numbers
to be Aimed should be left to be fixed by the Allied Generals in consultationwith the High Commissioners.(S) There shall be no withdrawal of theAllied troops from last em Thrace beforethe termination of the period of thirty days agreed to by M. TTeniselos unless theAllied Governments are agreed that adequate provision has been made for the maintenanceof order and the protection of the non-furkish papal ati o n *suf f icienHyThe new formula does not make these points/ clear.We repeat to you a telegram addressed by M. venizolos-solos to the Greek Legation and communicated tothe Foreign Office here which bears on pointnumber (S) above.&quot;(b) That the.

This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, and should bereturned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use/1POLITICAL.Telegram from Lord Hardinge (Paris)D. 3.00 a.m, 7th October, 1922.R.   10.25 a.m. 7th October, 1922.No.Following from Lord curzon for Prime Minister:I&apos;have just returned after a conversation of three and a half hours with Monsieur Poincare.   I had leftit to him whether or not to invite Count Sforza tojoin in the conversation..    It appeared that he had left Paris in consequence of the death of his father;hut after a time his counsellor, Monsieur Galli, was found and joined us at the table.I began by referring to the Paris agreement and claimed that every action of our representatives sofar had scrupulously conformed to its provisions.   To &apos;it I proposed to adhere and to judge every action bythat test,     I then narrated the history of theMudania conference, giving the contents of the veryremarkable convention which the three Generals hadbeen prepared to sign and which had reached me (tele-graphed by Sir Horace Rumbold) just as I left London.It showed that the Generals had been willing to go tothe extreme limit of concession - perhaps beyond what their governments might have sanctioned.     Butat the last moment the Turks had put forward a seriesof preposterous demands (the four points of Harington&apos;telegram) to which it had been impossible to accede.And
And finally General Charpy, acting upon instructions from his government, had seceded from his colleagues and had supported the demand of the Turks * reinforced by a threat to set their troops in Immediate motion,for the withdrawal of all allied missions and con-contingents and the immediate handing over of eastern thrace to the sovereignty and occupation of the Turks,This demand, I said, was wholly inconsistent with the paris note, it ignored the peace conference, and it-would, if acceded to, place the Turks in a position where they could hold the conference at their mercy.Such a course was peculiarly foolish at the verymoment when the allied Generals had &quot;been in completeaccord;   and when Monsieur Veniselos was exertinghimself to &quot;bring about the voluntary and peacefulretirement of the Greek army.     I concluded by askingMonsieur Poincare whether he was prepared to adoptthe sole feasible course by which the Paris note andthe alliance could be maintained, viz. by agreeing to the temporary occupation of Eastern Thrace by allied troops, pending the gradual transfer to Turkishadministration.Monsieur Poincare commenced his reply by ex-pressing the menacing fear that Mustapha Kemal hadalready carried out his threat, and had crossed theneutral lines.     It subsequently turned out that thiswas a bluff:   and before the end of the meeting atelegram&apos;was read of precisely the opposite character.Monsieur Poincare went on to defend the pacifyinginfluence of Monsieur Franklin-Bouillon, which I hadvigorously
vigorously challenged, and exculpated General Charpyon the ground that while he was not acting as hehad done under direct orders from the French govern-ment, the latter had given him complete lioerty to&quot;reconcile the British instructions      to theGeneral with the possibilities of the case&quot;, or inother words to make any concession which the Kemalistsmight demand as a condition of keeping the peaceDA rather sharp controversy ensued as to the man-ner in which General Charpy had acted upon his in-structions and as to the loyalty of the French govern-ment in issuing them:   and the persistence with whichMonsieur Poincare reverted to this subject throughoutthe discussion indicated the anxiety which it hodcaused in his own mind,Monsieur Poincare then went on to report a con-versation today with Monsieur Veniselos in which thelatter had gone far beyona the position he had taken up in London, had expressed his willingness to cedeto Turkey not merely the Maritza frontier but thefrontier of 1914s had a.;;ked only for the presence ofallied troops for one month while the Greek army and population were evacuating Eastern Thrace, and haddemanded no protection of minorities,- being satis-fied with his policy of expatriation within thatperiod.In the course of a rather heated argumentMonsieur Poincare went on to claim that the demand of the Turks to which General Charpy had acceded wasin strict accordance with the Paris note, and that
the Generals had no alternative, also in accordancewith that note, &quot;but to grant it0     This provoked an exchange of somewhat pointed civilities between usdelivered, in Monsieur Poincare&apos;s case, with thatpeculiar timbre of voice which he always affectsin moments of exceptional emotion0    At intervalsduring this fusillade I kept re&quot;iterating thequestions   - Did Monsieur Poincare accept the fourTurkish demands?     Was he prepared to abandon theidea of sending allied officers, commissions andcontingents to Eastern Thrace, and to admit the-Turks at once with an army thinly disguised as agendarmerie?    And finally if as he anticipated theTurks were to cross or had even already crossed theIsmid zone 5 what was he prepared to do?     To this he answered &quot;In no circumstances anything&quot; - a reply which also provoked a somewhat caustic referencefrom me to the Parisi note, which apparently meantnothing and only existed in order to be torn topieces by the Turks, while the French looked on0A revulsion from these dialectics was-fortu-nately brought about by the discovery, which waspresently made, that Monsieur poincare&apos; s information from Mudania differed materially from mine, thathe had never heard of the draft convention, or ofthe Turkish claims, and that what he thought GeneralCharpy had agreed to was merely a demand for theinstitution in Eastern Thrace of a civil administra-tion by the Turk s sIt further transpired that he was quite pleasedwith
with Monsieur Veniselos&apos; proposals and that he hadalready telegraphed out urging their acceptance hythe French representative and the Turks 0This rather surprising discovery enabled me tosay on the one hand that I could not go as far asMonsieur Veniselos in conceding a frontier muchbeyond what even Kemal had asked for, and that Ishould consequently adhere to the Maritza frontier of the Paris note, but on the other hand that Iwarmly welcomed Monsieur Poincars&apos;s acceptance ofan allied occupation of a month or more, and wouldbe glad to know what contribution he proposed tomake to it.Then   ensued a discussion as to the actualstrength of the French and Italian forces in EuropeanTurkey, in the course of which Monsieur Poincarepromised, if required, to send as many as weredesired of the French troops now at constantinople and Chatalja, or if necessary all;   while SignorGalli, not to be outdone, declared the Italian will-ingness to make a substantial contribution out ofwhat I believe to be a purely mythical Italian forceOf two thousand said to be at Constantinople or inthe neighbourhood,,I safeguarded the British position by sayingthat if we were attacked by Kernel, we might find difficulty in sending any troops at all, as weshould require to move every man to Chanak orGallipoli, but that in the event of war being avoid-ed
avoided I would consult my government as to their contribution.Finally I suggested that as we appeared to beso near to each other&apos;s views, and as it was desir-able to be precise, Monsieur Poincare should himselfdraw up the conditions which he was prepared torecommend for acceptance at Mudania, and that weshould meet again at nine in the morning to considerhis draft.Tills was agreed to and we separated,,Whether Monsieur Poincare will recede from hisposition in the morning I cannot sayc    But I judged from his general demeanour (l) that he is greatlyembarrassed by the position into which he has gothimself, (2) that he is genuinely afraid of a ruptureand (3) that he thinks he has the Kemalists prettywell in hand.
/his Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, and should bereturned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.]POLITICAL,Telephone Message from Lord Hardinge (Paris).R.     12.00 Noon 7th October, 1922..Following from Lord curzon: -When we re-assembled this morning at 9 o1clock *M. Poincare startled me by stating that information had been received from Rome that French and ItalianGenerals had come to an agreement reducing the sug-gested   month for allied occupation of Eastern Thraceto a fortnight.    Whether this proposal had been communicated to the Turks was not clear, though itseems highly probable.     I at once said that I could accept no such reduction of time which was obviouslyimpracticable since the provisional administration would barely have been set up before it was calledupon to withdraw and Turks would be admitted to a province still in a state of complete chaos and I asked M, Poincare to send instructions to GeneralCharpy that this plan could not be accepted.   this he declined to do taking up the extraordinary posi-tion that he could not instruct but could only adviseGeneral Charpy who must be at liberty to make any arrangements that he thought necessary in order toavoid war.      I pointed cut the unparalleled, charactrerand the dangerous implication of this attitude towhich I declined to be a party and said that I was convinced that my government would not authoriseGeneral
General Harington to re-enter Mudania conference onany conditions less than 1 had proposed,,I further pointed out the risk that M0 Veniselosmight recede from his undertaking about evacuationif the corresponding obligations for a delay of one month were departed from.After a prolonged argument the following textwas proposed:&quot;The three allied governments agree in acceptingthat the Greek troops shall be invited to retire assoon as possible to the west of the Iviaritza,     Theallied governments will ensure, by means of a pro-visional inter-allied occupation/ the installationin Eastern Thrace of a Turkish civil admin.istra.tionand gendarmerie.This installation shall take place within aperiod not exceeding a month after the evacuation of Greek troops.     At the expiry of this period,- theallied troops shall only continue to occupy duringthe conference certain points on the right bank ofMaritza and the places where they are at the presentmoment.(Continuation follows.)

Greek government have accepted his advice andinstructed their generals at Mudania in the abovesense, he said he had no definite assurance as hehad been urging them to make one unpalatable con-cession after the other, but he felt reasonablyconfident that they would accept - to revert to thedraft you will observe that the month is to date from the completion of the Greek evacuation, not from the beginning - a point on which I insisted,,But the Question of Karageatch is dealt with bythe suggestion of a continued allied occupationof the right bank of the Maritza after the with-drawal of the allied forces elsewhere, and duringthe peace conference; and that the last words cover the continued allied occupation of Chanak, Gallipoli,Ismed and Chatalja0I said that I could only accept this proposeddraft if my government approved and where preparedto instruct General Harington to re-enter mudania conference on these terms.     It must be understoodthat all the other fantastic Turkish demands willcontinue to be rejected.willGeneral Karington,/I judge from his varioustelegrams,&apos; be willing to agree on above lines and to join in immediate despatch of troops if his Majesty1s Government approve.     I suggestedtherefore that he should be instructed from london in this- sense,I told Monsieur Poincare quite plainly thatI could not e,accept position that decision of majority...
majority at Mudania; should prevail...    Either theremust he allied: concord or no. agreement at all.I further made clear that, in accordancewith Paris note, evacuation of Greek zones could notbe arranged without corresponding engagements onthe part of Kemal to respect neutral zones. .Monsieur Poincare had/heard of arrangement -    rxiproposed by General Harington in this respect but did not contest my unqualified re-assertion ofprinciple.Finally discussing   the contingency of Turkishrefusal,of the terms proposed, in which case monsieur poincare seemed prepared for a still further climbdown, I once more made clear British position whichis that, should the Isrned Zone be invaded, and theBritish position attacked we shall retire fromScutarie and if Constantinople be attacked shallretire from there also leaving our allies to bear the -entire responsibilities of the consequences thatmight ensure.Monsieur poincare^ retorted that in that casethe French would go too.This afternoon I am to discuss with monsieur poincare question of peace conference, its date and place and composition but shall not commit MisMajesty1s Government in any of these particulars,my object being to ascertain the views of our alliesrather than to express my ownnI hope to return to-morrow.
