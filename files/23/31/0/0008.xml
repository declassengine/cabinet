The telegram was to add that the Cabinet were relieved to find thatthe position at Chanak was different fromthat which the Staffs had gathered from hisreports, upon which they had advised that immediate action was necessary, and that,asthe General considered the situation was notdangerous and was daily improving, ho neednot act upon War Office telegram&quot;No. 91255(authorising the ultimatum) unless and until he considered that the situation demanded it,recognising that the primary responsibilityfor the security of our position at Chanakand the safety of our troops rested with him,

Further, that, asforeshadowed in Part I of War Office telegram no. 91247, full instructions were being sent by the Foreign Office to the High Commissioner,who would explain to General Fa rington HisMajesty&apos;s Government*s policy, and would inform him of the conditions and limits within whichhe was at liberty to&apos;act at the Mudania meeting.The text of the telegram as approved by theCabinet is attached as Appendix.

lobTHE MUDANIA S. In the course of the discussion leading to theCONFERENCE .- Conclusions recorded above, the Secretary of State fork, Franklin-Bouillon&apos; s     Foreign Affairs read tc the Cabinet the following telegraasasReport.  received during the meeting by telephone from Lord SardingeComifiunica-tion of in Paris (Ho3. 494, 495 and 496), containing the resultsInstructionsto tbe French up to date of M. Franklin-Bouillon&apos;s conversations withand italian governments. Mustapha Kemal;    conveying M, Pcincare*s hope that theBritish Government would agree with the French Governmentin accepting October 3rd. as the date for the Mudania meet-ing?    and stating that 11P Foinc&amp;re considered It essential in the interests of peace that the Greek evacuation ofThrace should take place as soon as possible, an opinion which he understood was held by the Allied High Commissionersat C one tantinople.The Cabinet noted with satisfaction that in messageHo .494 it was contemplated that there should be&apos;an inter-Allied occupation of Thrace.A comment was made on the great difficulties whichmight result If a &quot;total halt&quot; of the British troops was accepted.   This eould not possibly be extended beyond the zone of the Straits, since the routine movement of Britishdrafts, and so forth, for India through the Mediterraneancould not be interrupted, and even within the zone of theitStraits /might be highly inconvenient for the Powers whichwere responsible for the maintenance of order in Constant!-nople not to be able to move troops freely.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the messages .just read contained nothing which necessitated any alteration in theinstructions drafted by the Secretary of State. for Foreign Affairs for the guidance of general harington!(b) That the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should repeat the instructions on the political aspects of the Mudania Conference to Sir HoraceRumbold for General Harington to Lord Hardinge,who should be asked to convey the gist of these
instructions to M* poincare^ and requestMb to send similar instructions to theFrench High Commissioner at Constantinople,adding that the main object was that theMudania meeting should take place on&apos; October Srd.That a corresponding message should be sentto the British Ambassador at Rome, who should ask the Italian Government to send similarinstructions to the Italian High Gommissionerat Constantinople.-4-
THE NEUTRAL 3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drewZONE ON THEASIATIG attention to the possibility that difficulties might ariseSHORE OFTHE STRAITS, at the Mudania meeting in regard to the extent of the neutral zone on the Asiatic shore of the Dardanelles.   Ha strongly pressed that the question should be examined as to whetherit would be practicable to provide for the freedom of theStraits within a reduced area, in order that, if pressed to do so by Mustapha Kemal, General Harington might be ina position to make some concession in this respect.The Cabinet agreed  That the First Sea Lord, the Chief of theImperial General Staff and the Chief ofthe Air Staff should be invited to examine and advise the Cabinet as to what lines onthe Asiatic shore of the Dardanelles would meet our irreducible requirements in orderto secure the freedom of the Straits.
THP UNITED 4, At the request of the Cabinet, the Secretary ofSTAfSS OPAWiEBICA. State for Foreign Affairs undertook to enquire into theInformation   arrangements made by the Foreign Office for ensuring thatfor theBritish. the British. Ambassador at Washington is kept fully informedAmbassadorin Washing-   as to the development of the situation in the Near East,ton in regardto the Crisis and, if necessary, to expand the present system in orderin the near east. that Sir Auckland Geddes might be kept fully abreast withthe situation.In connection with this proposal the suggestion was made to the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs that, in order to avoid duplication of work, he might consider the expediency of sending similar telegrams tothose prepared by arrangement between the Foreign Officeand the Colonial Office for the information of the PrimeMinisters of the Dominions.2, Whitehal 1 Ca. gardens , S .W, 1,October 1, 1932.

[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, and should bereturned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.]TURKEY.POLITICAL.Cypher telegram to sir l. Rumbold (Constantinople),Foreign Office, 1st October, 1922, 7.30 p.m.No.455.His Majesty&apos;s Government are glad to hear thatMudania meeting is to take place without delay, andhave considered very carefully form of instructions tohe sent to Military commanders who will take part init.     Under Paris agreement sole object of this meet-ing is to fix line of retirement of Greek forces in eastern Thrace, in accord with Greek and Turkishmilitary authorities, the Angora government in returnfor this intervention to undertake&apos;not to send troopseither before or during final peace conference intoneutral zones and not to cross Straits of Marmora.These conditions must he borne strictly in mind.In accordance with them General Harington, as allied commander-in-Chief, was instructed by War Office onSeptember 28th to communicate with Allied Generals andthe representative of Greek forces, and to arrange fortheir presence.     It is presumed that this has beendons.When Mudania meeting takes place, on October 3rd,the Commanders should proceed with the duty assigned to them at Paris;   and should discuss and fix 12ie line in Eastern Thrace.     At the same time they should inform Mustapha Kemal that the allied governmentscannot exercise pressure upon the Greeks to withdrawbehind the line determined, until(1)     The Kemalist forces have, in accordance withthe/
the Paris terms, withdrawn entirely from theneutral  ones and(2)   until satisfactory arrangements have beenmade for the preservation of order, and theprotection of minorities of whatever nationality,in the evacuated areas6This will raise at once the question of theprovisional administration of Eastern Thrace pend-ing the meeting of the peace conference.   the generals at Mudania will obviously have no authorityto settle this question, which is one for theallied governments acting on the advice of theirHigh Commissioners.It is necessary therefore that the latter should at once proceed to draw up a scheme andshould&apos;forward it to their several governments with as little delay as possible.   We have dulyconsidered the opinions on this subject put for-ward in your telegrams Nos. 469, 474 and 487and have further received representations fromthe French and Italian governments on the subject.There seems to be a general agreement:(1)     that the administration should be con-trolled by allied officers;(2)     that local gendarmerie should as faras possible be employed to maintain order, andshould, if the necessity arises, be reinforced by allied troops;(3)    that it will be useless to hand overthe civil administration to the Constantinoplegovernment.,..
government which is powerless to exercise it.The French Ambassador hats communicated to us aproposal of Ma Franklin Bouillon for the employmentof allied detachments at selected places which M,Bouillon will doubtless communicate to you on his arrival in Constantinople to-day,   He admits thatTurkish troops could not be admitted until treatyof peace has been concluded and put into operation:and this is obvious, seeing that the   admission ofKemalist forces now would not only provoke a violent conflict but would render peace conferencesuperfluous by anticipating its decisions.   Uponthe principle of inter-allied occupation there istherefore complete agreementcWe are informing French and Italian governmentsof these proposals and are asking them to instruct their High Commissioners in above sense. We hope thatyou will proceed with latter to immediate elaboration of scheme in order that there may be no unnecessarydelayc   We cannot contemplate Mudania meeting beingspun out from day to day, in order to enable mustapha kemal to strengthen his position at Ismid with a viewto invading Europe.   We recognize immense danger ofsuch an invasion in its effect not merely on thegeneral situation but on&apos;the population of Constan-tinople,In the meantime we are glad tj hear from yourtelegram no 6 483 that three or four inter-alliedcommissions are starting at once or have alreadystartedo o.* *.
started for Eastern Thrace, to calm apprehensionsboth of Greeks and Turks.   Their advice should be of value in drawing up scheme of provisional administra-tion.Object of above instructions which are I trustclear, is:(1)     to confine Mudania decisions of Commandersto purely military role assigned to them at Paris;(2)     to require of Kemal loyal acceptance of paris terms, as condition of allied influence tosecure evacuation of Thrace;(3)     to refer to High commissioners all questions of a political character upon which Generalswill of course, report views of Kemal but which theyare not themselves competent to decide8For your own information.   General Harington isat- the same time authorised to inform Mustapha Kemalthat Great Britain cannot participate in above measures,which are designed to bring about peaceful settlementwhile Kemalist forces are taking hostile actionagainst Kurdistan and Iraq and that these must be suspended.   Kemal cannot go on making war in Asiawhile we are endeavouring to make peace in Europe.II.     In the course of Mudaiia meeting mustapha kemal may raise several points upon which you should instruct Harington, who has been duly advised, in following sense:-It is extremely undesirable that we should bedrawn......
drawn into any agreement about the stopping ofBritish reinforcements to the Turkish theatre,   suchan agreement would be bound to lead to disputes andto allegations of breach of faith in view of ourcomplicated troop movements which may be necessary from one point to another and to the general serviceof the Empire.   Moreover the stipulation which weshould have to exact against the forward movements ofKemalist troops and guns towards the neutral zoneswould certainly not be accepted by him, or observed by him if accepted.   Harington should therefore leave it to him to raise the question, and confine him/jinthe first instance to showing all the objections and difficulties,If, however, an arrangement of this kind is in-dispensable to the achievement of an otherwise satis-factory settlement we should be willing to agree to thefollowing:-That no reinforcements of fighting units for thearmy or Royal Air Force shall be embarked from any territory under the control of the British Governmentfor the purpose of reinforcing the British forces inyour command, over and above what has actually embarkedbefore the date&apos; of this agreement, and the BritishGovernment will ask the Dominions not to despatch anyforces after that date.   But we must retain liberty to add such medical and administrative personnel as maybe necessary, and to replace sick wastage.It must be clearly understood however(a)
(a) That the ahove undertaking only refers tothe fighting units of the army and RoyalAir Force and not to the supplies and stores required to maintain the said forcesin an efficient condition.(b) That the transoort of drafts to and from india and other British territory, throughthe Mediterranean, is not restricted.The whole of the ahove mist be subject to suchreasonable undertaking by Mustapha Kemal as Haringtonmay deem necessary and will hold good so long asKemal observes his undertakings.We must retain the right to carry out air reconnaissance over the neutral zones in the Dar-dardanelles and the Ismid Peninsula.These instructions are for the general guidance -of Harington who will report if other subjects areraised.Repeated to Paris (by bag) No. 334*First part only up to &quot;For your information&quot;,repeated to Rome No. 295 and Athens No. 276.
