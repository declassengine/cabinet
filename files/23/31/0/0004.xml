THE crisis in THEBEAR EAST.Cabinet&apos;sGcngratu-lationsto Lordiurzon.1. The prime Minister, on behalf of the Cabinet, offeredhis cordial felicitations to the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs on the result of his mission and on the veryskilful way in which he had conducted the negotiations.   TheCabinet, before Lord Curzon had left for Paris, had beenalive to the difficulties, but these had proved even greaterowing to M. Poincare&apos; a attitude, and the result was due tothe firm handling of the situation by Lord Curzon.    In thesecircumstances it was the more satisfactory to record thatthe Allies had reached unity in regard to their first atti-tttde towards Mustapha Kemol.   On behalf of his colleagues,therefore, he tendered warm congratulations.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thankedtho Cabinet both for their congratulations and for their support.g^s^xkscxkkixx^xtKgxgscls^nKkx   At no point did thePrime Minister and his colleagues fail to give completesupport, going even beyond what he had asked for, and the trust- and wide latitude given to him had contributed materially towards the result of the Conference.
THE SITUATIOH IN \:. THE BEAR EAST aInvitation toMustapha kemal:1 /Lord Curzo^s negotiations inParis.2.     With reference to Cabinet 50(22)Conclusion 4,  THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGNgave his colleagues a full account of his negotiations-tions with M. Poincare as described in his varioustelegrams from Paris and in the British SecretariesNotes of the Meetings, some of which had alreadybeen circulated.     Among the points which lord curzon more particularly emphasised may be mentioned the following. -   M. Poincare had wished to include in the portion of the Note in regard to the futurefrontiers of Turkey, the words &quot;in accordance withthe full terras of the national pact&quot;, but lord curzon had refused to agree to this;   the draftproposed by the British Cabinet (Appendix to cabinet 50 (22)) had provided for the return of eastern Thrace to Turkish sovereignty:    lord curzon, however,   had succeeded in obtaining morefavourable conditions than this as the Allied Noteprovided that Turkey should recover &quot;Thrace, asfar as the Maritza and Adrianople&quot;.     The Cabinet1sdraft had suggesteu the withdrawal of the Greek forces behind the line of the Maritza.     In theAllied Note, Lord Curs on had succeeded in arrangingthat the line should be fixed by the Allied Generalsin accord with the Greek and Turkish militaryauthorities at the Mudania Conference.     M.Poincarehad wished to convert the Mudania Conference intoa preliminary Conference, but Lord Curzon&apos; had insisted thai/the Conference should be confined toa single point, namely, the settlement of the line.,..behind
which the Greek forces should he withdrawn.     When thepeace Conference took place, the/British Governmentwould be opposed, everywhere by France and Italy *     some support might be obtained at the Conference from Serbiaand Roumania, but these countries were very much afraid of France and could not be counted on in the least tosupply any force to maintain the position at the Straitsin the meanwhile.     He thought that France was relievedFrtn-ck.at our attitude and that the^could be countec onseriously to support us in the negotiations to promote a Conference in accordance with the terms of the Mote.In reply to a question as to why the zones whieh theAngora Government was asked not to enter, either before or during the Conference, had been referred to as&quot;zones which had proyisl^onally; been declared neutral&quot; ,lord Curson explained that M.Poincare had insisted on the insertion of the word &quot;provisionally&quot; partly on theground that the line had been laid down in 1921 and published by the Allies but not accepted by MustaphaJKemal, and partly because he wanted to leave the Alliesfree themselves not to regard this line as permanent.Apart from the congratulations to Lord Curzon,which tuere recorded above in Conclusion 1, the commentwas made at the Cabinet, without any dissent beingexpressed, that the French desertion of the Britishtroops at Chanak was a most formidable historical event.
3.     After completing his review of the paris negotiations, THE SECRET ART OP STATEFOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS warned the Cabinet thatit was very probable that Mustapha kemal would insist as a condition of the Conference, onthe withdrawal of the British troops fromthe Asiatic side and p. rticularly from Chanak.In these circumstances it would be preferablefrom a political point of view, either thatwe should desist from sending further troops,or at le ast, that the present wide publicitygiven in the Press to the movements of our naval, Military and Air forces, should cease.The view was expressed that it would be dangerous to cheek the arrival of reinforcements.As regards the Press, it was pointed outthat several important newspapers were stillopposed altogether to the Government&apos;s policyand would almost certainly refuse not to publishmovements of troops.     Early in the present crisisthe London newspapers had been induced to desistto a certain extent from such publication, butlater, they had represented that the movements of troops were being published, locally both athome and abroad,,,and now wider publicity wasbeing given to all such movements.On a review of the above, the cabinet agreed:\      That short of the establishment of\     a censorship, which was not atpresent.desirable, no action could usefully be taken to induce the newspapers to refrain from publish-\   ing particulars of the movements\   of our forces.i . -THE SITUATION INTHE NBAS EAST.Publicity in regardto Military Movements:Attitude of the Press.
TEB CRISIS \        4. The Secretary of State for War read tele grama which$$jfeTHE NEAR !BffST. I he had received from General Harington, reporting theThe Naval and arrival at and subsequent withdrawal of ^u^kiah CavalryMilitary Sit-nation. \ from Irenkeuy.   He added that the reports that troops wereTjfr^al tfeaenr^i hmtnp conveyed by rail from Smyrna to Ismid had/hot been to prevent    /Passage of  /confirmed.Straits.The First Sea Lord made a statement as to the action that could be taken by the Navy to oppose an advance of the kemalists along the Ismid Peninsula.   Lord Beatty statedthat he had discussed the situation with Admiral Webb, whohad recently returned from the Wear T?ast.   Admiral Webb was of opinion that the Navy could play a great part in prevsnt-ing the advance of the troops along the Peninsula to Scutari.He said that the railway to Scutari, which ran along the sea-shore, could easily be destroyed by a Destroyer.   One roadran parallel to the railway on the southern side of the peninsula, and was equally exposed to the fire of ships.There was another road running parallel to the shore on thenorthern side of the Peninsula, which was also exposed tofire, but in a lessor degree.    Finally, there was a militaryroad which had beer: constructed by us,/one-third e-f jrhiefa!fcay en frho^ southern side of the Peninsula andT two-thirda^wfte-flnlanfl.   Parts of this road could be commanded by the navy and the Air Force, which, together, could, do a good deal to hamper an advance in force of troops along the Peninsula.It must, of course, be understood that he made that state-ment on the assumption that we still held Constantinople andthe European shore of the Bosphorus.   If Constantinople were abandoned, an advance of the Kemailst troops along the IsmidPeninsula could not be prevented by purely naval action,for 4that eventuality it would be necessary to withdraw our naval forces from the Black Sea.   Rven in those circumstances the advance of the Kemalist troops, could be delayed and hampered by naval and aerial action.   Lord Beatty then referred to
Sir Horace Ruraboldfa telegram Mo .451, pointing out the serious situation that wold-be created in Constantinople if the Wavywere - to carry out their instructions regarding the removalof shipping from the Bosphorus and shutting it up in theGolden Hora?0^ reaifeed that it might be necessary, for political reasons, to delay&quot;taking action to control theshipping until the last possible moment, but he desired topoint out the difficulties of the Ns?ral Commander wouldandthereby be greatly increased, because the removal saj  controlof a large number of craft in the Bosphorus and the neigh--bearing waters would take some time to complete.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that itmust be realised that no material assistance could be looked for from the French and Italian troops in opposing a Kemalistadvance on Constantinople.   It was even doubtful if they would co-operate with the British troops in maintaining order in constantinople.   He explained it was not the military policy to withdraw from Constantinople before we were compelled todo so-   Instructions had been given to General Haringtonthat&apos; we regarded Chanak and the Gallipoli Peninsula as of primary importance;   Constantinople came second, and theIsmid Peninsula third In order of Importance.   General Karing-ton fully intended to remain at Constantinople and to keeporder there as long as he was able to do so with the limitedforces at his disposal.    The defence of Constantinople againsta Kemalist attack was an altogether different matter.    Itwould be quite impossible for him to resist such an attack.**i^x^hevxl8yeeRmotsrxstx554esrxd4?93rs*35xx   It was stated thatthere were mow SO,000 armed Turks in Constantinople.   If anattack on Constantinople were threatened,  these 20,000 Turks would surround our small force, which would be in great danger of being cut off.    It was&apos; clear, therefore, that ifan. attack on Constantinople took place our troops must be withdrawn to the Gallipoli Peninsula.-.6-
The Prime Minister expressed the opinion that it was desirable to examine that situation more closely.    General-enit$t.Ha ring ton had stated that he could -aaa^ SO, 000 citizens ofConstantinople to foam a Civil Guard to help in the main-tenance of order.   That force would be supportedby theBritish detachment.   If it became clear, in the course ofthe next few days, that the safety of Chanak was assuredand that no serious attack on that place was contemplated,it might be possible for General Harington to transfer some-from.of his troops to&apos; Chanak, to Ismid and to Constantinople.He drew the attention of the Chief of the Impsrialt GeneralStaff to Lord 3eatty*s statement that all the approaches to Ismid Peninsula, were exposed to naval gunfire, and en-quired how that new consideration affected the opinion of&quot;the General Staff,   He agreed that it was most important that pur small force in Constantinople should not be allowedto become entangled in street fighting,The Chief of the Imperial General Staff replied that thepoints raised by the Prime Minister had been very closelystudied.   He was strongly of opinion, from his experienceof the late War, that the advance of a Turkish Army along the Ismid Peninsula could, not be prevented by naval action.Naval gunfire could, no doubt, harper an advance, but itcould not prevent an elated and. determined army fromadvancing.    General Harington would, no doubt, remain in constantinople as,long as he could safely do so.    It was certain that as soon as an attack on Constantinople wasdeveloped there would be a simultaneous rising in the City,and in fact our General was operating from a hostile Gapital.The.view was expressed that we had no choice but towithdraw from Constantinople if Mustapha Kemal advancedalon- the Ismid Peninsula.    Our troops would then have to betransferred to Gallipoli.   We could not be held to blame
for the withdrawal;   the responsibility lay with the French,Italians, Serbians and Roumanians, who had declined to give us military support.    In vie?; of the critical situation in constantinople it was most important that no measures&apos;of aprovocative character, such as interference with the shippingnecessary fore the economic life of the City, should be taken at tbe present time.The Secretary of State for the Colonies called attentionto the fact that General Harington had reported that the perimeter of the position at Chanak was only four miles,and not 15 tulles as had been previously understood.   this fact materially affected the value of the position of Chanakto secure the freedom of navigation of the Dardanelles, forthe Turks would find no difficulty In establishing positions on the shore of .the Dardanelles either Worth or South ofChanak.The First Sea Lord stated that he entirely agreed withGeneral Harington that the Wavy should take no action atpresent which might have the result of precipitating a crisis in Constantinople, but he pointed out that If we were at war at Chanafc with the Kemalists we could not remain at peacewith them at Constantinople *   If the Wavy were given cartebjancha and sufficient time, they could remove all craftfrom the Bosphorus and its neighbourhood and prevent theKernel 1st forces from entering Constantinople.    If the Wavywere not allowed to take measures for controlling the shippinguntil an attack by the Kemalists was imminent and the troops were withdrawn from Constantinople, it would not be possiblefor the Wavy alone to deny the passage of the Bosphorus tothe Keraalist force (a),Attention was drawn to the point that if the british forces were withdrawn from Constantinople while the Frenchand Italign forces remained, we should be charged with-8-
10 pjabandoning our Allies, just as we bad charged the Frenchand Italians with abandoning us at Ghana Is..The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed cutthat Kemal- Pasha was in daily comraunication with GeneralPelle.   He did not believe that Mustapha Kemal intended to advance against Constantinople, as the French were strongly opposed to his doing so and were using all their influence to induce him to adopt a moderate attitude.In reply to an enquiry by the Prime Minister, the Chiefof the Air Staff stated that the air ferees now a-t-G-eRetanti-&quot;weple^could hinder and delay a Turkish advance along the IsmidPeninsula, but that they could not guarantee to stop such an advance. &amp;^-4ho       ongth of , tho -a*rr- -fore-e..av-aiAab-le-qpaefi cl ont for -t hart - pur po o e.The Cabinet agreed   Ax^^y   &apos;&amp; sfefi   4Cfn*..o

ipjfissioN^ireland   tttffaAmi, of . The Prime Minister drew the attention of the Cabinetto two telegrams received from Geneva (Nos.49 and 51) inwhich Lord Pal four asked for the views of the Cabinet inregard to Ireland&apos;s entry into the League of Nations.    Fromthese telegrams it appeared that a Mr. MaoWhite, who repre-sented himself as the agent of the Irish Free State, -wasputting it about, that difficulties were being made by HisMajesty&apos;a Government as to ireland admission to theLeague.   Lord Balfour ashed for authority to let it be known,formally and informally, that the British Government wonIdview with satisfaction the conditional admission of Irelandinto the League, supposing, as he thought was probable, thatan immediate admission was not practicable under Article Iof the Covenant.   If such conditional membership was refused,be desired that the responsibility should not be on the Brit-ish Government, but on the Assembly.   He presumed that theform of the Irish application should be that she should become a member if and when the Constitution should becomefi rial ly e ffe c t iv &amp;.The Secretary of State for the Colonies explainedthat there had been a motion in the Irish Parliament regard-ing the admission of the Irish Free State into the League.The motion had been opposed by the Free State Government,whose view it was that tbe Free State should not apply for admission to the League until the Constitution had been passed.   It was incumbent upon Fis Majesty1s Government tosupport the &quot;Fce^ State Government on the question.\   The Cabinet agreed -\     That the Secretary of State for the colonies should advise the Prime Minister the same afternoon as to the reply to be sent to lord balfour.2, Whitehall hardens, S.W.1,September 25, l0s52.
