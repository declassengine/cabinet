fgtfjtFAfXOI With reference to Cabinet 60 (SS), Conclusion 1,jis ths misg/jgf. the Cabinet met for the purpose of hearing from the secretary?ft0 Parit Hege** of State for foreign. Affairs an account of hie recenttiations.meetings in Paris with ?z. Poincare.A summary of Lord Cur3on*s statement will be foundin AjaBgB&amp;laLJLt.jfjie Proposed Arising ont of the Paris meeting, the Secretary ofpeace Con-foresee. state for Foreign Affairs informed the Cabinet that an mediate question requiring solution was the answer tobe sent to Mustapha Kesaai relative to the proposed PeaceConference.   The Paris Hota had contemplated tbat the invitations to this Conference should be confined to theGreat Powers, together with, Beumania and Yugoslavia-, theobject of the Conference being to make peace between thePowers who had been and In fact still ware at war with turkey.   Since the Paris Hote certain nations had claimed to bs hoard at the Conference, notably Bus sis, Georgia,the &quot;Ukraine, and possibly Bulgaria.   The interest, however,of these new claimants was confined to the question of thefreedom of the Straits, and to allow nations like Russiaand Bulgaria to have any voice in the settlement of ques-   Ations such as the Capitulations, the rights of minoritiesin Turkey, the boundaries of the new Turkish sovereignty,etc., would have serious consequences and would lead tointerminable delays.   There were, in fact,, two broad ques-tions, namely, Peace with Turkey, and the Freedom of theStraits, and in Paris general agreement bad been expressed with the idea that these two questions should be remitted to separate meetings, tho first a general Peace Conference,between representatives of Turkey and the Powers that hadbeen at war with Turkey, to settle the terms of peace, andthe second a Conference between Turkey and all those Powers-1-
Who were interested in maintaining the freedom of theStraits *   Various places had been suggested as a meeting-place for the proposed Conference, and, on the4 whole, ithad been thought in Paris that this Conference should takeplace at Scutari.   As regards the date, it was clear thatthe suggestion of the Angora Government that the conference should begin on the 15th or 30th October was now out of thequestion, and the best&apos; course would be to arrange a date for the opening of the Conference as early as possible inNovember.   As regards the composition cf the Conference,it had been suggested in Paris by M, poincare&apos; that Prancewould be represented by a Minister with full powers,assisted by one or two politicians.   He (Lord Curzon),however, felt disposed to recommend that in the firstplace, at all events, the Allied High Commissioners atConstantinople should represent their respective Govern-ments, and that only when questions of great difficulty and contention arise should the High Commissioners be reinforced by Ministers .   This Conference would, as regardsthe freedom of the straits, merely indicate general prin-ciples, and leave the details to be settled at the secondOenf essence.The Conference dealing with the freedom of the Straitsmight be held simultaneously with, er, if that was Imprae-ticable. Immediately after the conclusion of the sainConference.   There was much to be said for requesting theLeague of Nations to tafce over this particular Conference,and, if so, the meeting-place would be - at Geneva.   It was highly desirable that the Peace Conference should begin to sit as seen as possible, and there was much to be said for endeavouring to secure that the period of allied occupation of Eastern Thrace should synchronise with theopening meetings of the Conference.   Ee (Lord Curaon)
Suggested that perhaps the best course would be for his to telegraph to Sir Horace Rumbold asking Ms views as toScutari as the place of meeting, and early in Wevember asthe tiite for the opening of the Peace Conference,In the course of the discussion it was urged that the suggestions of the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs raised three fundamental questions which would have to bevery carefully considered by the Cabinet:-(i) Would it be wise to entrust the negotiations at the Peace Conference to the High. Gossmis-*sleners at Censtantinoplef(ii) Was it feasible or desirable to have twoConferences, as had been suggested, and could the Question of the freedom of the Straitsbe considered apart from the general questionof a Turkish Peacef(iii) Should Sreat Britain resist &amp; demand from theKerns!isis that Russia, Georgia, the Ukraineand possibly Bulgaria should be present atthe Peace Conference!It was represented that, inasmuch, as the freedom of theStraits was the principal British interest, it would bedifficult for $rest Britain to sign a Peace treaty untilthe British Government knssr definitely what arrangements were to be made for the freedom of the Straits.   Differentrations attached very different meanings to this expressionand the subject was one which, could only be settled aftervery long and difficult negotiations,   On the signing of a peace Treaty the Kemalists would undoubtedly demand theBritish evacuation of Gfo&amp;nak, and it must be rememberedthat Lord Beatty had advised that the complete freedom ofthe Straita could not be secured unless Gharak was infriendly tends ..As regards the admission of Russia and the other SovietRepublics to the Conference, doubts were expressed whetherthe French Government would, in the long run, resist thepresence of Soviet representation, and reference was made
to the rumours that France had in feet contracted, thrcxighM. Harriot, a freaty with Russia involving de. jure rseogni&quot;-tion.prssh At this point General Harihgton*s telegram Ho. B-3gTurkishAdvance was read to the Cabinet, describing the continued penetration*at, Ismid,tion of the Ismid Peninsula by Turkish forces, the diffi-cult situation in which this Turkish advance placed general harington, and the decision that if the negotiations at mudania were not concluded today Admiral Tyrwhitt shouldtake precautionary measures.The Cabinet were informed by the Secretary of State forWar that, on receipt of this telegram, he had despatchedinstructions to General Harington in the sense of theForeign Office telegram to Sir Horace Rumbold, Ho,483,for the text of which see Appendix II.In this connection reference was made to the report bythe combined Staffs on the possibility of accepting areduction in the size of the chanak neutral zone (paper.P.-4256).She Cabinet agreed - (a) To express their appreciation of theimportant services rendered by theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs to the country, to the Alliance and tothe cause of peace, in the successful conclusion of his recent negotiationswith M. Poincare&apos; in Paris;(b) That an early meeting of the cabinet should be arranged for the considers-&quot;tion of - the question of the precisecharacter of the Conference or Confer-&quot;ences to be held for the purpose ofsecuring peace with Turkey and thefreedom of the Straits, and the place,time, and. composition of such conference or Conferences:(c) That in the meantime the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs should ascertain the views of the British High commissioner in Const ant inopie:
(4) To take note of the report of the combinedStaffs on the question of a reduction inthe else of the chanak neutral zone (paper.P.-4356), while recognising that thesolution of this question was left toGeneral Harington&quot;and the Allied Generalsat the Mudania Conference:(e) That Ministers should be available in theevent of a further meeting of the Cabinetbeing necessary the same evening.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1October 9, 1922.
d U 4APPEN-DIX__ISTATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSThe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs  remarked that the recent meeting in Paris could only be regarded as another stage in the advance to a Wear Eastern settlement.It was only to be expected that there would be a seriesof re-occurring crises of the kind of which the Cabinet hadrecent experience.      In accordance with the arrangement madeby the Cabinet he  (lord Curzon) had proceeded to Paris, andhad arrived at 9.45 p.m. last Friday.    On his arrival he found that arrangements had been made for a meeting withM.poincare^ at 11 p m. that night.    In order to avoid any difficulty with the Italians, he had at once communicated with M,Poincare placing upon the latter the responsibilityof summoning Count Sforza to the meeting.      Count Sforzahad,  in fact, left Paris for Italy and the Italian Charge1dfAffaires,  Signor Galli, arrived somewhat late at themeeting.     His (Signor Galli&apos;s) role throughout the pro-ceedings was to echo all M.Poincarefs sentiments and tomake points detrimental to Great Britain.    In fact lord curzon had had to contest two great Pavers absolutely unitedwho were only prepared to make concessions in response toconvincing arguments or the force of fear.After reminding M.Poincare of the terms of the ParisNote and of the policy of the British Government, it had beenLord Curzon&apos;s intention to level severe criticisms againstM.Franklin-Bouillon whose whole course of action had tended toinflame and aggravate the situation.    Lord Hardinge had,however,received ....-1-
received information, which subsequently turned out to beerroneous, that M.Poincare was bitterly incensed at theline M.Franklin-Bouillon had adopted, and that there was some prospect of the latter being relieved by the French1Government.     He (lord Curzon) had accordingly left unsaidmuch which he would otherwise have said regarding M.Franklin-Bouillon^ conduct.M. Poincare had^supported M. Franklin-Bouillon, andhad asserted that he was a pacifying influence in the councils of Mustapha Kemal.lord Curzon^hen proceeded to criticise the conductof General Charpy and particularly jffi the latter&apos;s desertionof his military colleagues at a critical point in theMudania negotiations.      Both on that occasion and at latermeetings there had been an exchange of amenities between lord Curzon and M. Poincare&quot; concerning General Charpy which,not&quot;though always courteous, had naespeY been entirely free fromacidity.     M. Poincare had warmly defended the french general, and in response to Lord Curzon&apos;s suggestion thatGeneral Charpy had acted under orders had repudiated thissuggestion, and said that General Charpy had acted only under General instructions and that he had been given by the FrenchGovernment complete liberty to make any arrangements withthe Turks which he thought would avoid war.     He had alsodiscretion whether or not he should refer to the FrenchGovernment before concluding any arrangements.      Lord Curzonhad pointed out that such an arrangement was quite unprecedent-dented, particularly in the case of Allied negotiations witha common enemy where a solution could only be found by maintaining ......
maintaining in its entirety the Allied front.     He couldonly say that the position appeared to him to he a veryhumiliating one.M. Poincare at this stage had lost his temper, endhad well earned M. Clemenceau^ description of him asbeing   weak and violent&quot;.Greatly to Lord Carson&apos;s astonishment M. Poincarehad then intimated the very startling news that M* Yeniseloswas prepared to surrender to the Eemalists the old pre-warTurkish frontier.     He had also represented H* Venizelosashaving no anxiety for the Greek inhabitants of eastern thrace,  and as being quite satisfied with the period ofone month before the entry into Eastern Thrace of a (Surkishcivil administration and gendarmerie.     Having regard tothe fact that in the Draft Convention General Haringtonwas prepared to agree to the withdrawal of Allied controland tho setting up of the Turkish civil administration ina period of SO days. Lord Curaan.thought that the bestAcourse for him to adopt would be to endeavour to securethat the period of Allied occupation should be as prolongedas possible, and that the introduction of the Turkishgendarmerie should be rendered as innocuous as circumstances would permit.
In the first instance M. Poincare had taken theline that he could not agree to any Inter-Allied occupationor provide French troops or officers or even Commissions.After argument, however, he had conceded the principle ofAllied occupation and when the question of the French troopswas raised, he had offered to withdraw all the French troops from the Constantinople and ChataljC lines for the purpose of keeping order in Eastern Thrace.     Signor Galli, not to beoutdone, had offered for this purpose many more troops thanit was known the Italians had available on the spot.     lord curzon had remarked that Great Britain would do what shepossibly could In this direction.     She had, however, to holdChanak and the Gallipoli Peninsula, as in the event of a turkish advance in force It would be necessary to fortifythe latter, in which case the British troops might have to be withdrawn from Constantinople.   M. Poincare had retorted thatin this event the French troops would similarly be withdrawn.As regards the evacuation of Greeks from eastern thrace, M. Poincare had suggested that M. Venizelos&apos;s fearswere absurd, and that the Turks were not going to indulge inmassacres under the very eyes of Europe.    At a subsequentInterview with M. Venlzelos, the latter had informed lord curzon that he had never agreed to the Kemalists being giventhe pre-war Turkish Frontier, and that he was very seriouslyconcerned with the prospect of the persecution of the Greeksin Eastern Thrace.     The month&apos;s respite was the most thathe had been able to persuade M. Poincare to concede and hewould do his best to extract the Greek population in thattime.   On the whole he,M. Venizelos, thought that the Greekmilitary authorities would conform to his advice.     later information...
information indicated that the Greek Generals had in factaccepted M. Venizelos&apos;s advice.   Lord Curzon had remarkedto M. venizelos that clearly M. Poincare must have beenunder a complete misapprehension as to his(M. Venizelos)attitude, and that as regards the frontier he, Lord Curzon,was only prepared on behalf of Great Britain to give the kemalists the Maritza frontier, which was in fact all thatthe Kemalists had. claimed.   M. Venizelos had expressed hisgratitude for Great Britain&apos;s action in the matter.Lord Curzon indicated that as the result of the paris Meeting time had Gertainly been gained.   The mudania conference was still going on and would not conclude before october 12th.    Its conclusions were not to be put into force until three days after execution, say, October 15th.   TheGreek Array would take at least fifteen days to evacuateEastern Thrace, which would bring the time table up to october 30th, and there would then be thirty days of allied occupation so that In point of fact the Greekf would haveuntil the beginning of December to make their arrangementsfor evacuation.    In the meantime it would be the duty of theAllies to do their best to protect and assist the refugees.With regard to the entry of the Turkish civil administration and Gendarmerie he, Lord Curzon, had urgedin Paris that the details should be left for settlement bythe Generals on the spot.   He had borne In mind QaiMwalSir H -R/u^bdld^sfiBTjafeBg4jSJS^ss opinion that there was no alternative to the setting up of a Turkish Administration and Gendarmerie in eastern Thrace.   Further, he had been able to secure fromM. Poincare a definite statement rejecting the preposterousdemands formulated by the Turks and mentioned in general harington&apos;s telegram.     On the other hand it must be franklyadmitted...
Q % Qoadmitted that if there should occur a further breakdown,Great Britain could not hope to look for any Frenchassistance*   M. Poincare reiterated his determinationthat France would not find a man or a gun      He, lord curzon, had recapitulated the position of the BritishGovernment and had used the following expression:-&quot;If we are compelled to retire from the Ismid Peninsula,the responsibility will not be ours.     if we are compelledto evacuate Constantinople and Scutari, the responsibilitywill not foe ours.     If war between Greeks and Turksbreaks out afresh, the responsibility will not be ours.lo WgoJcca&amp;e,The British Government/definitely wash their hands ofall responsibility for what may occur&quot;.
With regard to the subsequent stages of theproceedings, Lord Curzon informed the Cabinet that thethree points on which emphasis had been particularlylaid by the Cabinet, namely the withdrawal of the Turksfrom the neutral zone, the limit on the number of thegendarmerie, and the arrangements for the evacuation ofThrace, had been completely safeguarded by him in thecourse of the conversations.     To make matters certain,Mr. Vansittart had been instructed to ring up M. Perftittiand to obtain from him a confirmation that the three pointshad been accepted.   M. Peretti had replied on the telephone,&quot;Entendus et bien compris&quot;, and Lord Curzon had subsequentlyobtained itm ^oia-oaar^^-s confirmation in writing^ (Seecorrespondence attached, Annex I).Subsequently M. Peretti had enquired as to the precise area of the neutral zones, and as to whether ithad been decided that the Generals on the spot should agreethe number of the Turkish gendarmerie with the Kemalistrepresentatives.     Lord Curzon^replied to these two pointsas- appended.    (See Annex II.) .On the Saturday afternoon he had discussed withIvI. Poincare and S. Galli the arrangements for the forthcomingPeace Conference in order to obtain the points of view ofthe French and Italian Governments.   He had found M. Poincareand S. Galli in general agreement with his own views.Under the Paris Hote the invitations to the Peace conference were to be confined to the powers who were at war with turkey plus Eoumania and Jugo-Slavia.    As there were certain powers such as Eussia, Georgia and the Ukraine, and possiblyBulgaria, who had special interests regarding the freedom;of/
of the Straits whom it would be dangerous and objectionable to admit to any Conference dealing with the other problems in a Turkish peace, general agreement had been expressed in Paris with the view that there should be two conferences, one dealing with the Turkish peace and covering such questions as the capitulations, the protection of minorities and the territorial settlements - this conference to deal in quite general terms with the question of the freedom of the Straits - and another conference which might be under the auspices of the League of Nations, to which would be referred the specific detailed examination and settlement of the question of the freedom of the Straits, and at which in addition to Turkey and the Powers who were at War with Turkey, representatives of Russia, and perhaps other states should be present.

 M. Poincaré had made it perfectly clear that he would in no circumstances attend a general peace conference, or allow France to be represented at such a conference, if the Soviet Government was present. It had been generally agreed that a suitable place of meeting might be Scutari and that the date for the commencement of the conference should be early in November. As regards representation, M. Poincaré had said that the French Government would be represented by a Minister with plenipotentiary powers, but he (Lord Curzon) had favoured the Great Powers being represented at the outset by the High Commissioners in Constantinople, the Commissioners being reinforced by Ministers if and when questions of great political difficulty arose.


ANNEX I..   CIRCULATED TO THE CABINET *Correspondence &quot;between Lord Curzon and M. de Peretti.October 7th, 1922.Dear Monsieur de Peretti,I have now received the reply of my Governmentin regard to the formula provisionally agreed upon a tour meeting this afternoon.They are prepared to accept it subject to thefollowing conditions :-1,    That agreement on any other points must becontingent upon Turkish withdra?/al from, and respect for the neutral zone.2.    That any agreement for the admission ofKemalist gendarmerie before the conclusion of thetreaty of peace must contain a limit on the numbers ofsuch gendarmerie, failing which it might easily become a Kemalist army under another name, and endanger theposition of the allied occupying troops.     The numbers to be allowed should be left to be fixed by the allied generals in consultation with the High Commissioners,5.    That there shall be no withdrawal of theallied troops from Eastern Thrace before thetermination of the period of thirty days agreed toby Monsieur Veniselos and the allied Governments,unless the allied Governments are agreed that adequate provision has been made for the maintenance of order and protection of the non-Turkish population,&quot;As you will remember, I have already made eachof these points quite clear In our discussions, and/they

CIRCULATED TO THE CABINET.Correspondence between Lord Curzon and M. de Peretti.British Embassy,Paris,October 8th, 1922,Dear Monsieur de Peretti,* .I understand that with reference to our correspondenceof yesterday on the three conditions laid down by ray Governmentfor acceptance of the formula agreed to by the Conference, youdesire to be clear on the following points.l.That the neutral zone may if necessary be modified behindChanak in details by agreement between the Generals *As I stated during our meetings a slight modificationhad for practical reasons already been contemplated by our military and naval authorities.The answer to your question therefore seems clearly inthe affirmative.2, You ask if you are right in understanding that it is tobe left to the Generals on the spot to fix in agreement withthe Kemalist representatives the number of gendarmerie that theymay consider strictly necessary to allow in Thrace.The answer to this question is that the matter will certainly be left to the Generals to discuss and if possibleto arrange.     If there be disagreement they will of course have torefer to their Governments&apos;.(Sgd) CURZON OF KEDLESTON.
APPENDIX       II.Cypher telegram to Sir H. Rumbold (Constantinople).Foreign Office, October 9th9 1922.   11.0 a.m.Mo. 483.eee*eeaeVery Urgent.She phrase neutral zones in my 479 undoubtedlyreferred to zones laid down in May 1921.     But we had understood  com your 531 that Harington had prepared neutral zone convention specifying that, in the case of Chanak,neutral line meant line which had been held by Britishtroops for past three years.      This is further alluded toin Haringt on * s telegram Ho. 114 Personal for C.I.G.S. ofOctober 5th. and this proposal was well known at Pariswhere I agreed that chanak neutral line meant line asinterpreted by Haringt on.     I have never heard of anyproposal for modification of Ismid line which was originallylaid down in conjunction with Turks.     When thereforeHarington in his telegram to War Office D. 19 cypher of-October 8th said he hoped to secure signature to protocolincluding definite undertaking to withdraw from neutral zonesat once, we interpreted it in this sense.    Matter is one thatmay confidently be left to discretion of Harington.As to limitation of number of gendarmerie, words in our instructions were accepted by Peretti with concurrence of Poincare.     It does not matter whether this limitationis effected on initiative of Generals or by acceptance of number suggested by Turks and regarded by Generals as reason-able and strictly necessary for maintenance of law and order.War Office have aeoordingly instructed Harington by wireless in above sense.
