1. With reference to Cabinet 61 (SS)* the Cabinet weretheinformed that an agreement had been reached aty&amp;Ss&amp;sniaConference and ted been referred to Angora and Athens for confirmation.   A reply from Angora was expected at ESadaniaby 2 p.m. Greenwich time.It was recalled that, apart from any question whichmight be raised by the reply from Angora, there were anumber of questions connected with the forthcoming PeaceConference requiring early consideration.The Cabinet agreed -*To meet the same day at S p.m, toconsider the Situation in the !fearEast.
d 4 o . In the course of the discuss ton recorded in&apos;the pre-coding Minute, the Prims Minister mentioned that he andthe Xiord Privy Seal, were to deliver speeches at the end ofthe week in regard to the situation in the Hear East, -he proposed that advantage Should he taken of these cpportunl-tles to show that the policy pursued by the Government inregard to peace with Turkey had its origin in decisions taken by Mr Atqulth in 19IB in connection With the Russiandemand, in Sfiareh, 1915, for Constantinople and the Straits,,end the Agreement of April S6, 1915, for the entry of Italyinto the War,   Farther, that,, as disclosed by the Reportof an Interdepartmental Committee which met at the ForeignOffice in the Spring of 1915 under the Chairmanship of SirMaurice de Bunsen, even the possible attribution of Smyrna,to Greece was then contemplated in the event of Greececoming into the War.   Also, that in these transactionsMr Asquith,s Government had exposed   itself to the verycriticisms Which Mr Asqulth levelled at the present Govern-ment, insomuch as his principal agent in the partition ofTurkey had been Sir Mark Sykas, a distinguished Member ofParliament but not a professional diplomatist.   And, finally,that Mr Asquith&apos;3 Government had neglected to inform theItalian Government of the Sykes-Pieot arrangements whenthey were being negotiated - notwithstanding that italy was an Ally and that Article 9 of the Agreement under which she came into the War provided for Italy&apos;s sharing in anyPartition of Turkey.   He believed that the Sykea-PieotAgreement had never even come before the Cabinet, although,as there were no Cabinet Minutes. .; in these days, it was difficult to confirm this.
PAS AftRICOXr&quot;        S. With reference to Cabinet 5? (33) , Conclusion 4., theCabinet had before them Memoranda regarding the AgriculturalSituation by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries&apos;(Papers 0.P.-4261 and CP.-4S69),The Minister of Agri cult tire and Fisheries explained to the Cabinet that his earlier Memorandum (Paper CP*-4361) contained the tentative results of conversations which he had had with the Prime Minister and Lord Miner,though he did net regard himself bound by the suggestions made in it.   The later Memorandum (Paper CP.-4369) putforward concrete proposals for dealing with the presentsituation.   The Minister of Agriculture then made a state-ment amplifying and explaining his proposals, which were,in short.-Cl) That a simple measure should be introducedamending the Agricultural Rates Act so asto provide that in future the occupiers ofagricultural land should pay quarter poundageinstead of one-half poundage?   and(ii) That the Government should assist thosefarmers who had bought their farms sincethe Armistice, either by a State guarantee of loans or by State loans.These proposals, it was admitted, were merely palliatives,but it was urged that something should be done at once toassist farmers who, unless they were assisted, would notonly reduce agricultural wages but comert arable land ingreat quantities to pasture, thereby throwing many labourersout of employment and creating a serious crisis.Considerable discussion took place in regard to theabove proposals, which were criticised firstly on generalProm the point of view of the general financial situationfinancial grounds y it was pointed out that current expend!-ture. was the result of severe economies on previous expend!-ture, and that a further reduction of  60,000,000 would haveto be made in the Estimates for the next financial year.
Various Committees Bad boon considering these reductions jand, whilet it was hoped that it would be possible to reducethe Civil Service Estimates hy  80*000,000* there was no evidence that anything like the remainder could be obtained by reductions in the expenditure of the Fighting Services *The present proposals would represent a considerable in-crease in expenditure, since the proposal relating to rates would cost approximately  8^800,000 a year, and the proposalfor financial assistance to farmers would cost  10,000,000.further, while it was admitted that farmers wore seated on awrong basis, there was no special reason why the exchequer should suffer,   fhe rates paid by farmers had, no doubt,operated as ens of the factors in deciding what the rentof farms should be.   It was true that rates had recentlyincreased so rapidly that farmers really possess ed WK goodground for complaining of the present &apos;.system. But thiswas a rating question, and it would be a wrong principle to claim that the taxpayer should redress any Inequality inthe incidence of rates as between different sections of thecommunity.   Further, from the political point of view, the voting of money for the assistance of farmers at thepresent, time would be denounced by industrialists, as adole to landlords and it would be bitterly opposed by thegreat majority of the Labour Members.   As regards theproposal to advance money to farmers who had bought theirfarms since the -Armistice, this, if adopted, would mean that the State would undertake banking business.     Thedifficulties of these farmers were fully admitted, butexactly similar difficulties were being experienced inother industries, such as in the cotton industry, wherefactories had been bought at high prices immediately afterthe War and could not be operated now at a profit.
For the Stats to come forward and give special, assistance ,rto farmers would bo to invite similar applications from all branches of industry.It was also pointed out that, apart from the financialand economic objections to the proposals in question, the   -difficulty was largely a political one.   The farmer was now &amp;much leas powerful political factor than he had been.   the farmer possessing a farm assessed at  300 a year would pay 850 a year in rent, and, as compared with the small, shop-keeper assessed on Ms shop at  SO, was a big man In hislocality.   The small shop-keeper, moreover, in rural dis-tricts did not, and could not, live solely by the earnings of his shop?   he usually possessed other means of earning alivelihood.   The true comparison was with the small shop-keeper in the town who paid, say,  100 a year in rent, andif the rates In towns were examined it would be found thatthe sums paid in addition to rent were very large.   instances of the rates for various towns were quoted, and it waspointed out that whilst there was only one instance of separately under 10/-9. there were many Instances of rates of - overS0/-8,   Since four-fifths of the Members of the Rouse ofCommons represented urban const!titencies, it would be impoS-slble to pass a measure which relieved the farmer of theburden of rates at the cost of the Exchequer and left thesmall shop-keeper unassisted.   The same considerationsapplied to manufacturers, who might claim that if their position was compared with that of shop-keepers they were over-rated.   The fact was that the country was generallytoo highly rated, and the remedy lay in a reform of the rating system of the country, which need not involve anyresort to the Exchequer.   It would be politically impossibleto pass legislation according special asslstaneeto farmers
and to continue to refuse the applications, for directfinancial assistance which had &quot;been so repeatedly made tothe Ministry of Health hy Local Authorities during thelast two years, and to the Ministry of Labour by labour organisations.   At the present monsent the Miners&apos; Federa-tion had approached the Government with re pre sent a tionsas to the extreme poverty existing in the coal-miningindustry, and with a request for assistance.   It would beimpossible to give financial assistance to Agriculture andto refuse the appeal of the miners, and, subsequently, ofother industries in a similar position.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the following Committee, composed of;-The President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries (in the Chair),The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Health,The First Commissioner of Works,should meet at a very early date to examinethe agricultural situation and. to make eug-ges tions to the Gab5.net:(b) That the Committee should take into cons id-oration the proposals already made by the -Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, andthe objections advanced at the. Cabinet Meet-ing against these proposals.   In making their suggestions they were asked to avoid anything which might give rise to claims for financialassistance by other Industries, and, In psr-ticular, to bear in mind the importance ofmaking proposals which were likely to be acceptable to Parliament.Mr Pembroke Wicks (Secretary) -
3r-&apos; 3eJ J ci4.   fhe Cabinet bad before them &amp; letter from theSecretary to the Miners&apos; Federation of Crest Britain (geeAppendix) requesting that a Deputation of the ExecutiveCommittee of the Federation Should be received to lay before the Prime Minister the economic position of the mineworkers of the country, with a view to seeing what steps could be devised by which workmen could receive a livingwage for their 1abeurs.It was explained that the Deputation probably intendedto draw attention to eases of men who were earning undersBI a.week owing to short time.Some discussion took place as to what could be said in reply to the Deputation, and it was pointed out that nooffer of assistance could be Bade, sines the miners were suffering from the lack of demand for industrial coal,Such demand would only improve with an improvement of thegeneral industrial situation.   Allusion was made to thefact that railway rates were far too high, and neitherindustry in general, nor the mining industry in particular,would revive without a reduction in them. -This reductionof rates would involve a -reduction of railwayman1 s wagesand a consequent struggle with the railwayman.

COPY. ^JTHE M HIKES&apos; PEI^ATIUH QP GREAT BRIffJIiEN.55. Russell Square,London.    W.C.1.6th Qctoher 1922.Rt.Hon* David Lloyd George, H.P.,10, Downing Street, S.W.1,Dear Mr, Prime Minister,Res Present Wage Position in........Opal, KiPinp. Industry,..........I am instructed hy my Executive Committee to ask you toreceive a deputation of the whole Committee as soon as possible,so as to lay before you the actual economic position of the mine-workers of this country.     The wage position of the men is such,and has been for the last six months,  in some cases ten months,that they have been brought considerably below the poverty line.The suffering that has ensued can scarcely be described, whilst the whole physical efficiency of the men,  their wives and children,is gradually becoming impaired.     It is difficult to see how much longer these conditions can be endured.    We feel that it is our duty to lay the facts before you an the head of the Government, witha view to seeing what steps can be devised,  by which the workmenengaged in-this vital national industry can receive a living wagefor their labours.We have already submitted the facts of the case to the coal-owners, but without any beneficial result.    They have expressed their complete helplessness,  and inability to deal with thesituation.We trust,  therefore,  that you will be able to meet us at anearly date to hear our statements hereon.Yours very truly,(sd) FRAHK HODGES.
