Among thepoints he was asked to dealwith were the following the mai u object of theConference is to determine the line of retirement ofthe Greek foroes in eastern thrace in accord with theGreek and Turkish militaryauthoritiese as prescribed-Jot o   IS- -!*-5 p   Ua^a   a-PSeptember 23rd:The Angora Government inreturn for tbis interven-tion, must undertake notto send troops, either before or during the final peaceConference, into the neutral .sons and not to cross theSea of Marmsra.A representative of the Greek forces should be pr-sent, aswell as the Allied Generals.It should be made clear thatno influence can be brought tobear by the Allied governments on the Greek Government to retirebehind the line determined, untilthe Turkish Nationalist forces navewithdrawn entirely from theneutral zone, and satisfactory arrangements have been made forthe maintenance of order in
oEastern lEhrace until after theConference.She question of the provisionaladministration, occupation andmaintenance of the line inJSaatern  brace is one for 3p the Allied High commissioners and not for tfcUr Generals.She High Commissioners should pro-eeed to prepare a scheme on thefollowing basis(1) that the administration should be eontrelled by allied officers;(2) that there should be alocal gendarmerie, reinforced,if necessary, &amp;y allied troops, to maintain order;(3) that the Cons tantinopleGovernment would be powerlessto exercise authority.That Mustapha Kemal should be notified that hostile action byhis forces against Iraq andKurdistan must cease.(b) Shat the Secretary of ^tate for war should prepare a draft telegram to GeneralEgrington dealing with the militaryqtsestions which might be expected to arise at the Mudania meeting, includinginter alia instructions as to his attitude If Mustapha Kemal should askeither that we should evacuate theChanak position or that we should send no more&apos; reinforcements.In this connection the attention &amp;fthe Secretary of State for War was directed to a draft prepared under instructions from a Committee of Ministers, which met with the Secretary of State for theColonies in the Chair, on September26th, by the Chiefs of Staff of thethree services and the Secretary ofthe Cabinet.p Whitehall Gardens,  8.W.I.1st October, 1922.
P ? E 1! D I I.HOIKS OF A MEETING OF COMBINED STAFFS, HELD..AT THE ADMIRALTYAT Q9QG OH THE 1st OCTOBER., 1922.The Combined Staffs had to consider two questionsfl) Whether the safety of the troops at Chanak is endangeredby General Harington1 a delay in carrying out the instructions-,given to him TAnswer:     Ho, - for the reasons given below a(2) Supposing at the end of two or three days we want to act,,can we do so ?Answer;   Yes; with active support by Guns and Air,But if the Turk has in any way ostablishodhimselfj, the effect will not be so great asit would have been,,The answer to a telegram (Enclosure *AB)which has been sent to the Commander-in-chief,Mediterranean, will decide this latter point..The reasons for the answer to Question (l) are as follows:-Since CIsG,Sss verbal appreciation at Lord Curs on xshouse on Friday evening, 29th October -1.Position has disentangled itself by the withdrawal ofTurks on General Harden5s demand, and General Mardenis now pushing his wire out against the Turks insteadaf, as we were led to suppose, the Turks pressing on british position,2*Chanak position has been extended and we are establishingourselves on a 12 mile perimeter, and the General hasthe elbow room he requires-
So There Is. every indication that no attack willtake place at Chanak, but the main concentration of&quot;Turks is towards Ismid.To sum up:    General Harington1s telegram entirely alterssituation.We are no longer faced with possibility of a disasterby rushing of the British position.Although it would be much bett er to hare no Turks in neutral Zone, the report from General Marden that the Turkshave wi th drawn when requested, and that he is extending hiefront to a 12 mile perimeter, and the fact that the&apos; whole situ-ation should be under Air observation, make a large improvement.Before, however, the Government alter their instructions,the CJ.G.S. should ask General Hsrington certain questions:-1.     Has Harden got Heutral Zone under Air observation?2.      If he has, what does&quot; it disclose?3.     Where are the nearest Turkish Heavy Guns?4.     Is there any sign of Turks establishing themselves by digging in?(Initialled) B.1st October,  1922
In order to obtain information as to result of Airobservation, the following telegram is being sent to theCommander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, by wireless:-What information has been obtained by sea-plane reconnaissance at Chanak as to Militarysituation   behind Turkish lines.Especially..,require immediate informationwhether Turks are mounting heavy guns.Presume your seaplanes have been closelyexamining Turkish position in whole HeutralZ one *Have movements of infantry and artillerybeen observed on Panderma and Euzine Roads.
