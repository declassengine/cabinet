(82). the Cabinet srere$0, BAST.     informed that the&apos; Foreign Office and War Office had,, duringfor Horace    the night, received very important telegrams from Sir Horaceybold*e[glegx-ame.     Humbcld and General Harington, which, on the whole, answeredthe enactions which had been raised at the Cabinet*s previous meeting,(Siscwssion was adjourned for ten minutespending the arrival of the Lord President.of the&quot;Council.)The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs re;ad tothe Cabinet telegram No. 523 (gee, Appendix I) received fromSir Horace Humbold. giving a description of the proceedings at the i&amp;idania Conference, in the course of which lamet Pashahad, at the last moment, demanded, contrary to the terms ofthe Paris Hots, that Eastern Thrace should he handed over tothe Turks before the Peace Treaty, and that all the Alliedcontingents and missions should be withdrawn, and ted inti*-mated that he would set hie troops in motion unless thisproposal was at once agreed to.   This development had necessary -sitated an adjournment of the Conference, and lamet Pasha had agreed not to move his troops until 11-30 a.m., Greenwichtime, today.   Tho French General had announced that he. had .been authorised by his Government not only to sign the protocol, giving groat and important concessions..to theTurks, but, also to agree to the restitution to the turkish authorities of Eastern Thrace before the Peace Treaty, andwithout Allied supervision.   The view of General Haringtonand Admiral Brock was that the only way to avoid a conflictwas for His Majesty&apos;s Government to authorise general harington to tell the Turks that His l&amp;jesty*s Governmentwould summon the. Greeks to leave Eastern Thrace., and allied troops would be 3snt there forthwith to replace the Greeks.a further telegram (No. 524.) from Sir Horace Rumbold (SeeAppendix II) was also read to the Cabinet^ giving a

This development had necessary -sitated an adjournment of the Conference, and Ismet Pasha had agreed not to move his troops until 11-30 a.m., &apos; Greenwichtime, today.   The French General had announced that he hadbeen authorised by his Government not only to sign the protocol, giving great and important concessions.to theTurks, but also to agree to the restitution to the &quot;turkish authorities of Eastern Thrace before the Peace Treaty, andwithout Allied supervision.   The view of General Haringtonand Admiral Brock was that the only way to avoid a conflictwas for His Majesty&apos;s Government to authorise General       . .Harington to tell the Turks that His ?&amp;jesty&apos;s Governmentwould summon the Greeks to leave Pastern Thrace, and allied troops would be sent there forthwith to replace the Greeks.A further telegram (Ho. 524,) from Sir Horace Rumbold (SeeAppendix II) was also read to the Cabinet^ giving a-1-
description of the meeting of the Allied High commissioners a ions-reand Generals to die ones the deadlock reached at ftidania.In the coarse of this meeting the French High Commissionerhad intimated that, according to M. Pranklin-Bouillon*sinstmotions, it was desirable, if possible, to maintaintha Allied Commissions and contingents- in Eastern Thraceuntil the conclusion of peace, which indicated that their maintenance, in the view of the French Government,, was notindispensable.   The French and Italian High Commissionerswere strongly in favour of yielding to all the Turkish tmm.demands, and made it clear that the Questions of Kara j&amp;gatchand $astern Thrace were not such as would justify hostilitiesThe French High Commissioner had urged that several AlliedBattalions should at once be despatched into Thrace as proof of good faith, and the Generals had agreed that without some such gesture the Turks would not agree to further delays andwould order their troops to advance.   The British HighCommissioner had represented that there were limits to theforbearance of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and that the more that was yielded to the Turks the more would be demanded.He had also requests d General Raring ton to make every effort to gain further time.   The concrete proposal in these tele-grams. Lord Cur son pointed out, was that we should announceotir intention to send Allied troops to Thrace and summonthe Greeks to withdraw behind the M&amp;ritza.   The contents ofthese telegrams, however, raised a much larger question,namely, that of Allied solidarity and the full maintenance,in letter and in spirit, of the Paris Hots.   In his opinion the time had now arrived &quot;when it was necessary to send animmediate communication to the French Government pointingeut that the policy which France was pursuing in the HearFast was wholly inconsistent with the solemn pledges whichhad been given to the Allied and embodied in the Paris Hots?-2-
0 3peralpington&apos;sflegrams.pointing out to her the consequences that must inevitablyfollow from her action?   and ashing her definitely to state  -whether she was prepared to stand side by side with. GreatBritain in carrying out the policy agreed upon in the PartsHots.   It would be necessary. In the proposed ccmmunteatioii.to acquaint &quot;the &quot;French Gevexament with the fact that theBritish Government fully realised the trend of French policy,and the French Government would have to ba told that Great.Britain would be prepared, in the event of the Greeks retiringfrom Has tern Thrace, to sand British troops into B&amp;stemThrace for control purposes.   The French Government shouldbe asked whether they were prepared to join with Great Britain,and, if not, how they could justify such a refusal. theconsequences of which mast inevitably be the end to all allied eo-operation in the Bast and possibly alsswhara.   a communication of this character should be made to the FrenchGovernment at once, as it was essential to bring homo to IS,Poincare himself the very serious situation which had arisen in consequence of the inexplicable attitude adopted by france in the last few days.The terms of the Paris Note (Paper G.P.-4SS8) were, read to the Cabinet, and particular attention was directed to paragraph 3, in which the Allied Governments stated their willingness to support at the Conference the attribution ofthe Maritza-Adrianople frontier to Turkey.   The whole tenemrof the Mote was unmistakable, and it was most difficult tosee how the French Government could reconcile - their presentconduct with its terms.   It was not likely that M. Poincarewould, be prepared, when faced with the facts, to give adirect negative to Great Britaln*s request for co-operation.The Cabinet, were then informed of the contents of tele-grams Mos. B-3 and 15-4 (Bee Appendix III), which had just been received from General Harington, and which confirmed
2 i (lthe information contained in Sir Horace Basfcold^ telegrams.In part S of D-4, .General Harington intimated that he hadno doubt that unlees the Allied Governments acted at once the nationalists weald march on Constantinople &quot;and can crocsinto our area in three or four days&quot;.   This referred to thesmall perimeter at Scutari at present held by the Britishtroops, and not, of course, to the Ismid neutral so na.   InPart S of the same telegram General Harington ashed whether he was to defend Scutari and Constantinople as long as hecould with five Battalions and a few batteries and aeroplanes,assisted by the Navy, in the hole of holding on until-rein-for cements arrived, or whether he should evacuate at once toGallipoli and Chanak, leaving a fait, aeoomolj in Constantlynopla.The Cabinet at this point were informed that a telegram(No .514) (See Av)penAl%. .1?) had just been received from sir horace Humbold, giving particulars of the present civil administration in Eastern Thrace.   This administration wasGreek, and the Police and Gendarmerie were also Greek.   Ifthe Greek Army withdrew from Eastern Thrace it would be most difficult, if not impossible, to persuade the officials toremain unless they had very definite guarantees of Safety,It would be impracticable for the Allies&apos; to organise a civil administration in the time available, nor could the Gonstan-tinople Government provide such an administration.   Trie only alternative, therefore, appeared to be to allow the Kemaliststo take over the civil administration, the Allies taking Stepsto avoid disturbance and panic.   These visa.&apos;a were shared bythe British Commissioners French and Italian colleagues,and in this connection Sir Horace Rumbold referred to his telegram Ko.506.   It seemed clear that the British Commisslonercontemplated a Turkish military occupation of Eastern Thraceto prevent fighting and disorder, and a civil administration
which, in the elroums taneae&apos;, aa martial law would be inoperation, would be&apos; of&quot; a subordinate character;   thatAllied forces should be sent Into Eastern Thrace, if avail-able?   and that-, purely from the point of view of the main-tenanca of order, the country would not be worse off undera Kernel 1st civil administration than under a Greek re aimsdeprived of fresk military help.   Sir Horace Bumbo Id was disposed, therefore^  to advise that Great Britain shouldyield to the Turkish demand and admit a number of Turkishofficials into Eastern Thrace.Tbe Cabinet were reminded that one of the /fundamentalconditions of the Paris Mote had been that the Kemalistforces should evacuate the neutral zones.   Was it now pro-posed to water down this most important condition?   Sucha decision might have to be taken, but the full consequencesshould be weighed before Great Britain lightly abandoned theposition which she had up to the present maintained throughthe negotlations.The view was then expressed that the responsibility forthe consequences would rest with our Allies; that publicopinion in Great Britain was not prepared in any event toundertake a war with Turkey,, and particularly was not pre-pared to fight to keep the Turks out of Europe. Xn theascircumstances, it was asked, ought the British Governmentto take the responsibility of adopting military action inthe Near East when her French and Italian Allies had decidedthat the issues at stake were not worth the contest?   Thequestion put on the previous evening (Cabinet 5?was repeated:-   &quot;Suppose a decision is taken to instructGeneral Harington to allow the Turks to occupy Thrace, andsuppose the Greeks decline to accept;   in those circumstances to what lengths should the British Government be pzepared togo to put pressure on Greece?&quot;   The reply was made that no&apos;
pressure should he put on Greece, but that Mustapha Kemalshould be all or ed - Sims we could not prevent him &apos;  to cross into Europe and fight it out with the Greeks .   Therehad, it was pointed, out, been Balkan Ware in the past inwhich Great Britain had not been involved, and we oughtto limit ourselves strictly to securing the freedom of theStraits .   On the other hand, it was pointed out that if great Britain should now surrender to the Turkish demands and allow the Turks to re-occupy Eastern Thrace, the greeks would rightly represent that the terms of the ParisNote; had been violated.   It should be remembered that - the greeks were now prepared to agree to the evacuation of eastern Thrace provided that the Allies took over thecontrol of that country.   Was it proposed, in these sir-cumstances, to allow the Kemslists to cross the Bosphorusand fight out their quarrel with the Greeks in Europe?It was one thing to say to the Turks that Great britain would not. allow the invasion of Europe.   It might be doubtful whether Great Britain alonw had the/power-5 a-
9 &apos;r1 9power to prevent such an invasion, &quot;but it was quite another thingafter the neutral sones had been violated for Great Britain to put pressure on the Greeks to evacuate Eastern Thrace.    She most she could be excepted to do in the circumstanoes was to remain strictlyneutral.It was then urged that instead of ending a written coinmunica-tion to the French Government it would &quot;be far hatter, if such acourse were practicable, for the Secretary of state for foreignAffairs  imself to go over to Paris this afternoon and state toMonsieur poincare in person the British objections to and critica isms of the- French line of policy and also to speak very plainlyto him on the subject of the activities of Monsieur Franklin Bouillon.It should &quot;be made clear to the French Government that Great britain had gone to the very furthest limit in promising Eastern Thrace tothe Turks, and it should also he made clear that the British Govem-ment recognised that it was no longer possible for Great Britainalone to carry out the jpull policy of the Paris Hots in the absenceof French and Italian support.    In these circumstances it wasnecessary for Great Britain to separate herself from her Allies inthis and perhaps in othef questions and she would proceed to occupyand hold Gallipoli and chanak with such assistance as she could obtain from other quarters.    In other respects she ceased to intereslherself or taice any responsibility for what might happen in constantinople or in the Balkans and in Thraee.    Through thetreachery of Mrar allies Great Britqin had been rendered powerless tiagreedcarry out the axigiHHl policy and the only course consistent with her honour was the one proposed.    It was generally accepted that lord Curaon must have authority to speak to Monsieur poincare insome such terms if khe found that the situation required it.Some discussion then tookmplace as to the action to be takenin the not impossible event of hostilities breaking out with theTurks in the next few days.     General agreement was/
was expressed with the view that in any event Chanak and the gallipoli Peninsula would have to be defended.    With regardto the Scutari position it was urged the situation was verydifficult.    The view was expressed that if it became necessaryfor Great Britain to adopt a neutral attitude towards theTurks and to permit them to cross the Straits, it would be essential to adopt a correspondingly neutral attitude towardsthe Greeks and to permit their forces,  both naval and military,to enter the neutral zones for the purpose of defending theterritory allotted to them under the Treaty of Sevres.    Further,it might be necessary to take steps to secure that other powersmaintained an equally neutral attitude towards both combatants.It was also pointed out that if the French Government maintained their present attitude it would be most difficult for GreatBritain to justify the continuance of those provisions of theTreaty of jSeuilly under which Bulgaria was not allowed tomaintain an effective army, and indeed that all the peace treaties would be in jeopardy.It was agreed:-(l) That the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should be requested to proceed to Paris that afternoon for the purpose of laying beforeMonsieur Poincare the views of the British Govern-ment on the lines indicated in the dicussion.(2) That the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should cause a telegram to be despatched to sir horace Kumbold informing the latter that theposition was regarded as so grave that he (lord curzon) was leaving for Paris to discuss theposition with the French Government and thatarrangements should be made to secure that general harington should not return to Mudania or if hehad already left for that place he should be warnednot to commit himself on any important point withoutfurther instructions.(3) That the Secretary of State for War should send atelegram to General Earington to the effect that unless he could rely on the French troops standingwith the British troops at Scutari he was not tofight at Scutari but was to have the fullest dis-cretion to withdraw from that position and from constantinople at the moment when he was satisfiedthat such withdrawal was required by the militarysituation.
(4)   That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should arrange for an informalmessage to be sent to Monsieur Teniselosin Paris inviting Monsieur Veniselos toremain in Paris in, order that he might be available in the forthcoming discussions between Lord curzon and Monsieur Poinoard.(5)    fhat the Secretary of State for Air should arrange for an aeroplane to be availablein Paris to bring Lord Ourson1a accountof his interview with Monsieur Poineardto the Cabinet.

Rumbold, (Constantinople).October 5th 192,D.     3,0 a.m.     October 5th 1922.R.     5.30 a.m.    October 6th 1922,,No. 523.SUB-CQTyTMITTKE.General Harington has returned from Mudaniaand has explained situation.He has shown me protocol drafted by allied generals as result of three days discussion withIsmet Pasha,     This protocol gives very great and important concessions to Turks.     Generals hopedthat this protocol would have been signed to-day butat the last moment Ismet pasha demanded that eastern thrace should &quot;be handed over to the Turks beforepeace treaty and that all the allied contingents andmissions should he withdrawn.     This demand is ofcourse entirely at variance with allied proposal of September 23rd.Ismet Pasha intimated that he would set his troops in motion if allied generals did not agreeto this proposal, which annuls the whole basis ofthe conference.General Harington proposed that (? conference,omitted) should adjourn until 2.30 tomorrow afternoon in order that generals should have time to refer to their governments and High Commissioners.   after some discussion Ismet agreed that he would not movehis troops until 2.30 p.m. i,e. 11.30 G.M.T. tomorrow.French
(2)French general then announced that he was authorised by his government not o:.ly to (group omitted) protocolbut to restitution to Turkish authorities of eastern thrace, before peace treaty, end without alliedsupervision.     Ke had informed General Harington ofthese instructions before (? this) last sitting.In view of this situation which hopelessly weakensthe allied front, the generals had no alternative butto return to ask for instructions.Allied generals had no knowledge of reply fromAngora accepting peace conference until after theyhad left Mudania this afternoon.     You will havenoticed that reply is entirely silent on the subjectof acceptance by Mustapha Kemal of conditions attaching to promise of support of Turkish claims to eastern thrace.Turkish claim to consider Eastern Thrace beforepeace treaty seems difficult of acceptance.     imagine that Paris proposals contemplated setting upof machinery by peace conference for adequate pro-tection of minorities.     This would go by the board under new Turkish claim.Turks (? have, omitted) just requested per-mission to transport to Eastern Thrace an unlimitedforce of gendarmerie which might in effect be anarmy.   They also claim Karagach and the right tocarry on military operations even (? after) signature of military convention until latter is ratified by governments concerned.Allied High Commissioners are meeting allied generals
generals immediately to consider deadlock (group undec.)at Mudania.My colleagues will probably wish unofficiallyto advise in an identic telegram to three governments.In view of French attitude which can only &quot;be characterized as a treacherous surrender inspired by FranklinBouillon it was necessary for me to send this separatetelegram.     In view of General Harington and AdmiralBrock the only way to avoid a conflict (? is) forHis Majesty&apos;b Government to authorise General harington to tell Turks that His Majesty&apos;s Government will summonGreeks to leave Eastern Thrace at once and allied troops will he sent there forthwith to replace Greeks.Please get Admiralty to send your instructionsto General Harington by wireless tomorrow to &quot;IronDuke&quot;.

(D).Very Urgent.My immediately preceding telegram.Allied High Commissioners and Generals met to-night to discuss deadlock reached at Mudania.I asked French High Commissioner whether Frenchgovernment was as stated by Franklin Bouillon reallyready to agree to Turkish demand for restoration of eastern Thrace in full sovereignty previous to entry into force of peace treaty and without adequate guaran-tees through allied commissions for minorities there.If so it was quite contrary to Paris decisions.French High Commissioner said that FranklinBouillon was very affirmative on this point and thathis own instructions to the effect that it was de-undesirable if possible to maintain allied commissions and contingents there till conclusion of peace in-dicates that their maintenance in view of Frenchgovernment was not indispensable.     I immediatelysaid that I did not recognise Franklin Bouillon as representing my government and that I considered hisimpolicy had been pernicious.Italian High Commissioner having said thatFranklin Bouillon had had no authority to speak forItalian government at Smyrna argued strongly infavour
(2)favour of yielding to Turks.     French High Commission-er took the same line.     They said that two pointsleft outstanding namely Karagatch and maintenance un-til conclusion of peace of allied commissions in Thracedid not constitute justification for possible world war;   question of Karagatch was of comparative un-importance and as a suburb of Mrianople Paris notemight be interpreted as including it in that citywhile Thrace was in any case to be restored in a fewmonths time to full Turkish sovereignty and that during that time conference would be sitting,French High Commissioner pointed out that at base of Turkish demands was their distrust of vague promises of Allies and suggested that it might be possible to allay this by some immediate gesture giving proof ofour good faith such as despatch forthYfith of severalallied battalions into Thrace.     All three generalsagreed that without some such gesture Turks would not agree to further delays and would order their troops to advance,Italian High Commissioner urged that if warresulted world would attribute it to unwillingness ofallied High Commissioners and generals to take re-sponsibility for concessions which were of small account in comparison with issues involved,,
w 3 *-I replied, that world would attribute it to intracti-bility of Turksa that the more we yielded to Turks themore demands they would make and that the next might wellbe evacuation of constantinoples that General Haringbon,Admiral Brock and I had done our utmost to avoid war,that there were limits to forbearance of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and that I must now report facts to my Govern-,mont and leave it to them to appreciate whether in refusingthese demands they were prepared to contemplate wareIn the meantime ponding the receipt of your viewsI have requested General Harington to make every effort to gain time5to point out to Ismet Pasha on his return toMudania tomorrow that powers have now received reply ofAngora Government and to ask him how he can reconcilereadiness of that Government to attend conference withthreat to recommence military operations.,Repeated to Athens NoB 175a

To-day at conference after Generals had done utmost to strain their powers on points of detail with a view to meeting the Nationalists Ismet reverted suddenly to basis of Conference. He maintained that putting together the Allied note of 29th and Angora&apos;s reply seems to be the conection? of Franklin Bouillon. The basis in the event of a Conference taking place is that Eastern Thrace shall be restored fully to the Nationalists by Treaty of Peace without any foreign control when the Greeks have left. Charpy stated he was empowered to sign to this effect. Mombelli, however, and I declared our inability to make any such contract. It was quite obvious that Franklin Bouillon has twisted the Turks into thinking he could sway the Allied Government besides the French and authorise the Generals to make political decisions. It was decided by the Generals after they had consulted together to adjourn Conference until October 6th at 14.30 hours so that they might have time to return to Constantinople and to consult High Commissioner and exchange telegrams with their respective Governments.

Part 2. 3. I think that the net result of the above is good as it has now been made clear that Mombelli and I do not take orders from Franklin Bouillon. We have undertaken to obtain instructions on the following points by 1000 hours G.M.T. October 6th:-

(a) Can we commit ourselves to basis that Eastern Thrace is to be restored to Turkish severeignty before ratification of treaty?

 


(b) Without admitting full Turkish severeignty in Eastern Thrace can we consent to withdrawal of Allied ?representatives and troops immediately Turkish authority has been restored in each locality?

(c) Can Adrianpole on return of Turks be considered to include the ring of forts (one group under) the Maritza and also Kara Agatch railway station and village? Turks make a strong military point of this and require Greek Administration removed from Kara Agath.

(d) Can pressure be exercised on Greeks to restore civil hostages evacuated by them from Anatolia?

(e) If Greeks refuse to sign Convention are we still to endeavour to reach agreement with Nationalists?

Last Part. May the replies to the above questions be expedited, please to H.M.S. Iron Duke so as to reach me before 1000 hours G.M.T. October 6th?

Franklin Bouillon has been propaganding heavily regarding the military prowess and strength of Turkey. Ismet tried to bluff ? into freedom to renew hostilities but ended by giving his assurance to refrain at least until 1430 hours local time on October 6th. The Turks are worried about report which they received yesterday regarding Creek atrocities in Thrace and they are anxious that the Allies should immediately send troops into Eastern Thrace to ensure security. I have not yet received any confirmation of the report that forty villages were burnt in Thrace on the other day. In fact, Colonel Saryanis who ? here denies it emphatically.

A copy of this telegram will be conveyed to the High Commissioner by had.

First.C.H.H, 114 Personal for C.I.G.S.     Have had most difficult task.After ?3 days inoessant work in a network of political intrigue wehad reached stage when I hoped to sign 2 conventions today (a)- Convention dealing with evacuation of Greeks behind MARIT5A andarrangements for ?installing Turkish administration subject to approval of Allied Governments,    (b) Convention ensuring securityof neutral zone with modifications in case of Zone ?at Chanak to amount of SANDJAK which has already been in British occupation anda marking on ground of a safety line for immediate future.    in course of todays discussion Ismet no doubt prompted by Hamid, Angoraand Franklin Bouillon demanded that Eastern Thrace and sovereigntythereof he handed over to Nationalists as soon as Nationalistadministration is installed and Allied Missions and troops withdrawnthat is in 1 month and without ws,committing  treaty of peace.Part Two,Allied Generals have had identical instructions until today whenFrench Government or Franklin Bouillon have given Charpy authorityto agree.   Mombelli and 1 refused and I have adjourned conferencetill tomorrow afternoon while- we refer to Governments and am return-ing to see Rumbold.   After disoussion Ismet agreed to withholdoperations till reply received.     If unsatisfactory operations willoommenoe again ?at once against Greeks via Constantinople withdiversion no doubt against CHANAK *-   Greek representatives arehere.     Had conference with them today.     They are trying tobuild up force to hold Eastern Thrace.     There is no doubt inmy mind that unless Allied Governments act at once Nationalistswill march on Constantinople and oan cross into our area in or 4 days.
part Three.Government has to say at. once whether they will take action to evacuate.Greeks immediately and send Allied troops into eastern thrace or whether they will engage Nationalist Army.     It is veryserious situation and I request to know whether I tm to defendScutari and Constantinople as long as I can with five battalions and a few batteries and aeroplanes assisted by Navy in the hope of holding on till reinforcements arrive or whether I shall evacuateat once to Gallipoli and Chanak leaving ?fait accompli in constantinople.     Irt reality Government havd got 24 hours in which to say whether they will give Mustapha Kemal his terms regardingThrace or whether England is to fight him for Constantinople whichit has already been agreed that he shall have.Last part*It is direct threat and at leaet 3 times during conference Ismet has said that he must oancel stoppage of movements.     Charpy behavedvery ?well throughout conferenoe and it was black treacheryforcing him to desert me and agree to Mustapha Kemal&apos;s terms.?If date of peace conference is actually fixed I think I could holdon at Scutari as he will probably come up against us as he has done at Chanak and see what happens.Per our prestige it is best to be here at time of Conference if wecan but it will be some time-before I can get reinforcements andI cannot take much from Gallipoli and Chanak.Received 7 am. 6.10*22.
o0APPENDIXPOLITICALTUSKEY.De cypher.Sir H. Surabold.  (Constantinople)October 5th 1922*7,20 p.m*October 5th 19881.45October 6th 1022.10.514.URGENTYour telegram No, 464.All my information shows that present civil administrationof Eastern Thrace is run by Greek superior officials many of whomcome from old Greece and that   subordinate staff also is mainly-Greek.   Police and gendarmerie are directly controlled by militaryauthorities.If Greek army were to evacuate and existing civil adminis-tration were retained difficulty would be to get officials to remainunless their lives were assured by complete allied occupation.Proceedings of first day at Mudania show that Kemalistswould never accept such proposal.     Greek administration and moreparticularly police and gendarmerie cannot fail to go to pieces onceGreek army evacuates.     Problem is to provide substitute.     Alliescannot organise temporary administration of their own.   Constantinoplegovernment has been ruled out.     There remains no alternative but to let Kemalists take over.   This will certainly not of itself tend topacify the country or appease racial animosity but it will notdefeat these objects any more than would the maintenance of Greekadministration.     It is better anyhow than chaos.     My proposal isthat Kemalists should take over administrative services generally,that
that we should not attempt to establish control of all such services, but that we should endeavour to obviate panic and mutual vengeance by continued presence of allied commissions,by attaching allied officers to gendarmerie and by reserving the right to send allied detachments to Eastern Thrace.Question of officials is one of detail.   Principalofficials would doubtless come from Anatolia but Kemalistscan if they like draw on local notables and unemployedofficials here to fill   subordinate posts.Jiy French and my Italian colleagues share viewsindicated in my telegram Io* 50G.     While expressing readiness to join me in elaborating scheme for civil administration asproposed in your telegram Ho.456 they have both stated thatthis procedure does not seem to them to answer the require-ments of the situation which necessitates speed above all.French High Commissioner states in this as in all othermatters agreement with Turks is necessary and that he hasempowered General Gharpy to settle question on which agreementdepends.     In these circumstances it is useless to attemptto formulate scheme until general principles are settled asresult of Mudania meeting as contemplated in your telegram10.441.I realise my proposal prejudges future of Thrace to greater extent than yotir note contemplated but we have promised Eastern Thrace to Turks and expediency seems to be only possible guide on this question.Repeated to Athens ito.169.
