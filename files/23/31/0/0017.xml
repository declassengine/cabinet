&quot;JStfSNGTH OF- it With reference to Cabinet 63 (22)-,. Oonchision i,&quot;-the^ .JUOOP^ IN &quot; &apos;HEAR        , Secretary of State for War raised the-question of theiAST .possibility of reducing the number- of troops in the Near-East pending the forthcoming peace*3 Conference;   He explain-ed that one of the Battalions sent to the ConstantinopleCommand had been proceeding to India on relief, and that ofthe Battalions now in the Near East four had their secondBattalions also&apos; abroad .   He - was. anxious  that these Battalionsshould,   if. possible,, be relieved in order that he mightresume the trooping &quot;programme:    other-wise there would soon-&quot;bo a shortage of troops in India;If it was decided that the troops were to be main-tallied at their present strength, it would be necessaryimmediately to-make arrangements for hutting.   He did netpropose to provide for the hutting of the troops in Constan-tinople, Ismid, Thrace, or Chanak.Hutting accommodation had already been ordered for7,600 men on the Galllpoli Peninsula, and he now sought authority to order huts fox1 Si;000 more men, at a cost of 240,000.,There were approximately 20,000. troops now in the HearEast, including. 1^000 Marines.   There were three Battalionsat Constantinople, three Battalions in the Ismid Peninsula,three Battalions in Thrace, throe Battalions in Gallipoli,and. three at Chanak.,    Under his proposals, hutting accommo-dation would be provided for 13,600 men at Gallipoli, and7,000 troops in Constantinople and Thrace would be 1-ftunprovidod for.    The huts already ordered would be ready atthe beginning of December at the earliest, and if a furtherordor was now placed these huts would be ready about threeweeks later, &apos;   &apos;The Chancellor - of. the. Exchequer suggested that, unless it was assumed that -w.e should be ufc war&apos;with Turkey, thetroops in Thrace and in. the Ismid peninsula could be with-drawn and accommodated, in-Constantinople.    He agreed that
the correct policy was to maintain the strength of thetroops in tho Near Fast until the Paace Conference hadtaken place, but he desired to urge the importance of notexpending money in tho emotion of huts on the G-allipoliPeninsula that might never bo used.   He understood thatthe military expenditure up-to date was under  2*500,000,and the naval expenditure about  150,000.The Secretary of State for v&apos;or explained that the Britishtroops in Thrace were.taking over the Rodosto section ofthe line.   He had received a telegram from Sir CharlesHarington reporting that Rodosto was now full of refugees,that typhus was prevalent, and that the troops could not therefore be put in billets1 in Rodosto.    It was not, how-over, proposed to provide huts for the troops in Thrace;they would be under canvas.    Sir Charles Harington was opposed to any reduction of the troops at the present time,as he mistrusted the Turks.   His proposals included provi-sion for 1,000 men of the Air Force and 1,000 Marines atGallipoli, as well as for certain troops which would haveto bo moved fromChanak, where they were now under canvas.He consider-d that the provision for hutting 13,500 men.was the minimum that could be agreed to with safety.A- suggestion for the appointment of a Sub-Committee toconsider th- question o^ hutting was discussed, but theSecretary of State for War did not press for it.It was agreed -(a) That no important reductions should bo madein the strength of the troops in the NearBast before the P^aco Conference is cOn-cludnd:.(b) That the provision of new huts should bereduced to a minimum..       The Secretary ofState for &quot;ar gave tho Chancellor of theExchequer a personal undertaking to securethat no unnecessary expenditure should be\5fojrr0d.
2. With reference to -Cabinet -52-(-22)^^Append.ix V (ll),Conclusion (K) , in the course of the discussion--rveoKyrdedin the preceding Minute, the Secretary of State for Foreign-^Affairs raised the question as to-what exactly were thefunctions of the troops in the Wiar East,   Ha suggestedthat, firstly, they were there to prevent an infringementof the Mudania Agreement, and it was clear that all theexisting forces were required for that purpose.   He men-tioned that it was reported that there had been an infringe-ment of the neutral zone by the Turkish troops on the IsmidPeninsula.Secondly, we required to have sufficient forces avail-able to resist such military pressure as the Turks might attempt to bring to bear upon us during the Peace Confer-ence.    It was quite possible that they might endeavour,by a treacherous coup, to overthrow the Conference.Thirdly, the view seemed to be held that by retainingour troops in Chanak and Ismid we&apos; could ensure the decisionof the question of the freedom of the Straits in the sensedesired by us.    It was necessary to consider what exactlywas meant by &quot;the freedom of the&quot;straits&quot;.   If freedom of passage for all mercantile ships was meant, no difficulty would arise in time of peace;    but if it was proposed toensure freedom of access for ships of war at all times, soas to enable us to threaten Constantinople by naval actionin time of crisis, he believed there was not the remotestchance of our securing a decision in that sense at the conference, although it was desirable that we should en-deavour by every diplomatic means to obtain such a decision.At the Conference the issue would be between Great Britainand the rest of Europe.    The other nations would endeavourto prevent an arrangement which would secure to us theadvantage we gained by the possession of sea power.   Franceand Italy would be opposed to us, 3,s would Russia and hersatellite States, and other nations such as Serbia and
Roumania.    No support was to be looked for from tbo other powers.    If we wore now holding Chanak with tho objectof forcing a solution, of the Straits question in accord-anco with our wishes, we were suffering under an illusion.Such freedom of tha Straits could only bo ensured by large forces maintained on both sides of the Straits.    It wouldbe quite impossible for the League of Nations to .ensuresuch a fro-domeThe Secretary of Statn for the Colonies suggested that what wo wanted was to ensure that ho batteries should beerectod on the shores of the Straits in time of peace.    he believed that the League of Nations could ensure ouch ademilitarisation of the Straits .    It was important thatthere should be no physical means of stopping our Fleetfrom entering the Dardanelles if a sudden crisis aroseand we desired to bring pressure to bear -open the Turks.
SUPPLY OPMUNITIONSOP WAR to poland.3. With, reference to Cabinet 63 (SO) v Conclusion 4, theSecretary of State for Avar pointed out that, on Kay 17,1920, Mr Bonar -Law, in the House of -Commons, had referredto a promise of a free- gift cf munitions of-war to Poland.The Foreign Office were now urging that this promise shouldibe carri-d out.1-   The Lord President of the Council observed that thatpromise must have been given before Poland and Russia were at war with one another, and he considered that the promiseshould be regarded as having lapsed.   He was not disposed to five fren gifts of munitions of war to the Poles, whohad a!-ays been reoaloitrant. :   .The Secretary of State for Fo:Por&apos;-&quot;ign Affiairs disclaimedknowledge of .the Foreign Office wish for the free gift ofmuni+lons to Poland.It was agreed  That no decision should be taken onthe qr.estion.
SUPPLY OP WAR      4. With reference to Cabinet 59 (22), Conclusion 3,MATljftlAL TOrOUT-UNIA. the Secretary of State for Mar stated that at Genoathe Roumanian Government had asked us to supply them withmunitions of war. -.We had not complied with their request,and they had subsequently obtained some munitions from France.; Tho Roumanian Government&apos; had recently sent overM. Diamandy to this country with a list of the arms andequipment which they desired; to obtain.   We had consider-ablo stocks, of surplus stores, and ho (Sir laming worthington Evans) had, at the request of the Cabinet,seen Mi--Diamandy, who had handed in a list showing which of the requirements of the Roumanian Government we could provide from our surplus.    If we complied with their request so far as we were able, a sura o^  500,000 in cashwould be involved.   He put forward the question purelyfrom the military point of view, and he had not considered it from the Foreign Office or financial aspects.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that itwould be impossible to ask the House of Commons to vote &quot;500,000 to provide munitions of war to Roumania.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs&apos; statedthat the Foreign Office had up to nOw had no part in thediscussions with the Roumanian Government on this subject.The Roumanian Government had sent a Minister over toEngland while he was absent in the country.   He had been seen by the Prime Minister, who had made a suggestionabout the provision of arms, and had forwarded to him an account of his conversation.   M* Diamandy had come tosee. aim (Lord Curzon)- later, and he had replied that hekr*ew nothing of the arrangement that had been made .   Hehad discussed with M. Diamandy the Conference in Paris,and had informed him that, though his good offices, theRoumanian representative would be present at tha PeaceConference.   He- had pointed out to &quot;vr. Diamandy that the
Roumanian interests were the same as ours, and M. Diamandyhad undertaken to discuss the attitude that Roumania shouldtake at the Conference :&apos;ith his Prime Minister on returning to Roumania.He (Lord Curzon) had had no opportunity of considering this question, and he would like to consider it from theForeign Office point of view.    It was possible that itmight be worth while^ to spend some money to get Roumaniaon our side at the Peace Conference.   M. Diamandy haddenied that Roumania had undertaken any obligation toFranc e.It was agreed  That the discussion of this question should be adjourned in order that theForeign Office right present theirviews on it.
3b7   j;M; . &quot;: - lBELIEF OF 5,    With reference to Cabinet 53 (22), Appendix V (5),REFUGEES M1^? THE Conclusion (e), the Lord President of the Council read aHEAR EAST..letter addressed by the Foreign Office to Sir maurice hankey,  dated October 12, 1922,.which is attached as an appendix.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs explainedthat it was most urgent that we should provide the sueasked for.    The lives of millions cr people were at stake,     \and we were under&quot; obligations to the Greek refugees, whosemisfortunes were in part due to the encouragement they hadreceived from us.   He urged that the request conveyed in.-the letter should be complied with.The Chancellor of the Exchequer observed that our offer of assistance was conditional upon contributions beingmade by other nations.   His experience was that in such arrangements we were always left in the lurch by other nations, who seldom fulfilled their promises.   He was opposed to a continuation of the practice of making coritri-buttons on those terms.    The stores asked for had a cashvalue.    Large surplus stocks were in existence, but theywere gradually being sold as the market could absorb them.It would be easier to contribute stores then cash, and if other nations contributed their quota, as promised, he was quite willing to agree to the request, but on the condition that the  10,000 was not in addition to the conditionalmaximum contribution of  50,;000 to the Nans en fund-.   he pointed out, however, that the grant of money to the Greekr-fugees would have a repercussion as regards the treatmentof the refugees from Southern Ireland, many of whom weredestitutec    There was no Parliamentary answer to the charge that tbe Greek refugees were being given more favourable treatment than the loyalists from the South of Ireland.The Secretary of the Cabinet aslfd If he should makea formal communication to the Secretary-General of the Leagueof Nations notifying the League that the total British
-contribution would how, not&apos; exceed  40v0.00.   As there appeared little&apos;prospect of the. total amount of  50,000being subscribed by other.nations, it -was considered thatit would suffice if the Secretary explained the positionprivately to Sir Eric Drue mond..It was agreed --(a) That the grant of  10,000 worth of medicalstores to the various British relief organ-is at ions combined under the name of the&quot;All British Appeal&quot; should be sanctioned,this amount being deducted from the totalof  50,000 promised conditionally by HisMajesty&apos;s Government- to the league ofNations for the relief of refugees in theNear Fast:(b) That the Secretary; should write privately to the Secretary-General of tie League ofNations, explaining the.position to him.
6, With, reference to Cabinet 79 (21), Conclusion 10,at 12-45 p.nu, after some Ministers   had left, the PrimeMinister arrived from Buckingham&apos; Palace and said thatHis Majesty the King had spoken to him on the question ofthe observance of Armistice Day.   His Majesty had asked the views of the Cabinet as to whether he himself should attend a Service at Westminster Abbey.   The Prime Miniatehad replied that Lord Curzon had in previous years under-taken the organisation of the Armistice Day Observance,and he would ask for his views.Lord Curaon said he would gladly consider thematter and advise the Cabinet.After a short discussion it was agreed to recommend to the Cabinet:-(a) That Lord Curzon should again undertake,on behalf of the Cabinet,  the organisa-tion of the Armistice Day Observance:(b) That h- should advise the Cabinet as towhether it was expedient to introduce into this observance a Service at westminster Abbey to be attended by theKing and his Ministers.Mr Baldwin andLord Birkenhead, Mr Churchill, Mr BalCaptain Quest had left.     Lord BalfouCurzon, Lord Lee, Sir Robert Home and SirLaming Worthington Evans Were present.t/ Lord
