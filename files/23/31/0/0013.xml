fully as to the progress and probable result ofthe Paris negotiations.The Cabinet al$cP had before them a draftof a further telegram lo, 480 (See Appendix III)from the Under Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to Sir Horace Rumbold telling him of the satisfactory conclusion of the Paris conversations and requesting him to inform General Haringtonthereof and to authorise him to resume negotiations at i-3udania on the basis of the Paris formula as .regards Eastern Thrace, but on tho clear understandingthat the reservations and conditions insisted upon by the Cabinet and by Lord Curzon in Paris, are accepted and embodied in the Convention to be signed by the Generals.Some discussion took place as to the precisemeaning of the expression used by M. Peretti &quot;entenduet bien oomprieB, it being suggested that in a telephone message this meant &quot;heard and wellunderstood&quot;.     The general opinion, however, was,that this meant &quot;agreed and well understood&quot;.The Cabinet agreed-(&amp;,)    That the Under Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs should arrangefor the despatch forthwith of thedraft telegram No. 480. to sir horace Rumdo Id.(&amp;)   That a copy of this telegram shouldbe communicated at once to theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs in Paris.(O   That the Secretary of State for war should telegraph to General Haringtonstating that agreement &quot;appears tohave been reached in negotiations inParis.    Instructions upon which you should act have been sent to youthrough Sir Horace Rumbold&quot;(this telegram was 91352 of the 7th October).
1 i 4ftfljpXISH. BEH&amp;KD       2. The Cabinet had under consideration a telegramyQK 1KB RELEASE0 HOSTAGES ABU from General Harington (Ho. D. 10) stating that IsmidPRISONERS.Pasha had demanded at Midania that the Greeks should immediately and without reciprocity release allTurkish hostages and prisoners of war.     general harington stated that the Allied Generals thcss&amp;ghtthat the release of the Turkish civil prisoners was just and fair s&amp;gd had decided to refer the questionof requesting the Greek Government to release all prisoners of war for the favourable consideration ofthe Allied Governments.     It was suggested that inall probability this question had been raised at theMudania Conference and that General Harington hadbeen present at the meeting and had stipulated thathe was only in a position to discuss questions otherthan those which had been specifically reserved for,or referred to, the Allied Governments.In the course of the discussion the UnderSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theCabinet that the Italian Charge d* affaires, had approached him with a request that the BritishGovernment should make a strong appeal to lustaphaKemal who had threatened to try as traitors all thoseGreeks in Asia Minor who had served in the greek army as volunteers.     If tried these men would inall probability be shot.The Cabinet agreed :-(&amp;)     That the Under Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should arrange for thedespatch to Sir Horace Rumbold of atelegram referring to General Harington&apos;telegram (Ho. B. 10) and requesting himto inform General Harington that, whilewelcoming the release of all prisonersof war, the British Government would notbe prepared to put pressure upon theGreek Government unless the arrangement was for the release of prisoners on a strictly reciprocal basis.     Sir Horace/Rumbold
Bumtold should also bo informed, that heshou&amp;d associate himself in the strongest possible manner with the protest of theItalian High Commissioner in regard toMustapha Kemai*s proposal to try fortreason ail the Ottoman Greek volunteers,and that he should endeavour to obtainthe concurrence in this protest of theFrench High Commissioner.     Sir HoraoeRumhold should also be told that theBritish Government could not believethat iiustapha ICemal intended to carryout his threat but that this t&amp;seatshould he horns in mind in any arrangements for the release of theTurkish civilian prisoners of war.That a copy of the above telegram shouldbe sent to Paris for herd curzon&apos;&amp;information.
Turkish Atrocities and British Public Opinion.

3. Reference was made to the evidence which was rapidly accumulating from very reliable sources of the appalling nature of the Turkish atrocities in Anatolia?. It appeared that the intention of the Kemalists was top solve the minority problem by exterminating the non-Turkish population.

The view was generally expressed that when the true facts had been fully explained to the British public, there would be a strong revulsion of feeling in favour of the policy adopted by the Government. This policy was the only one which could save Constantinople and Thrace from becoming the scenes of similar holocausts. There was considerable support for the view that in this matter the press did not represent British public opinion, and that strong support for the Government would be forthcoming when the state of the negotiations made it possible for the Government&apos;s case to be fully stated.  
Kemalist Invasion of the Ismid Neutral Zone.

4. The Cabinet had before them a telegram No.541 (See Appendix IV) from Sir Horace Rumbold stating that a Kemalist force of cavalry and three thousand infantry with artillery had advanced 4 miles into the neutral zone at Ismid. It had been told to clear out at once. Small parties of Kemalists had also appeared at Chile and at Kayular on the Ismid road in the military area.

In this connection reference was made to War Office telegram to General Harington, No.91328 M.O.1 of October 6th, informing him in accordance with Cabinet 58/22. Conclusion 3, that unless he could rely upon French troops standing with the British troops in Scutari, he was not to fight at Scutari, but was to have the fullest discretion to withdraw from that position and from Constantinople at the moment when he was satisfied that such withdrawal was required by the military situation. It was urged that as it was clear from the Paris conversations that the French had no intention of giving active military help at Scutari, the time had now come when General Harington should ask his French colleague formally whether such assistance could be given, and if he received a negative reply, he should make arrangements for evacuation in the event of a serious Turkish menace materialising.

The Cabinet agreed:-

That the Secretary of State for War should despatch a telegram in the following terms to General Harington -

M. Poincaré declarations to the Marquis Curzon in Paris make it appear extremely doubtful whether you can rely upon assistance from the French in the event of an advance by Turks in Ismid Peninsula.

He also made clear that instructions toHarington would also be not to agree to any reduction and therefore as any reduction can onlybe achieved by unanimity,if unanimity is notsecured no reduction can take place.He thinks it will be very undesirable to engage in telephonic correspondence with monsieur poincare who is now in the country.

Formula ends.French.oo
French and Italian representatives at the meeting had strongly urged reduction from one month to a fort-night of the period of proposed inter-allied occupationbut although they said that their Generals at Mudaniahad actually agreed to this, Lord Curzon firmly declined to accept the proposals   He moreover insisted on makingthe month date from the completion of Greek evacuation.The question of Karagathh is held to be covered by thestipulation that there is to be a continued allied occu-pation of the right bank of the Maritza after the with-drawal of the allied forces elsewhere, and during thepeace conference.   The last worda of the draft formulaare to ensure the continued allied occupation of ChanaksGallipoli, Ismid, and Chatalja0Lord Curzon made it clear (1) that in recommending the formula to His MajesoyVs Government he did so on theunderstanding that all the other Turkish demands not covered by the terms of the Paris note of September 23rdwill continue to be rejected;    (2) that in Mudania con-ference no decision by majority was admissible but thatthere must be allied concord or no agreement at all;(3) that the evacuation of Greek zones could not bearranged without corresponding engagements on the partpf Kemal to respect neutral zonesoThe Cabinet have to-day inf ormed Lord........

Thenumbers to be allowed should be left to be fixed bythe allied Generals in consultation with the high commissioners.(3)   That there shall be no withdrawal of theAllied troops from Eastern Thrace before the termin-ation of the period of thirty days agreed to by-Monsieur Veneselos unless the Allied Governments are agreed that adequate provision ha,s been made for themaintenance of order and the protection of the non-Turkish population.Cabinet are awaiting reply from Paris to abovetelegram.Please now inform General Harington that Parisnegotiations are not yet completed but seem to pro-mise satisfactory solution.
