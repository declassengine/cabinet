GTHE CRISIS IK THE With reference to Cabinet 51(22),BEAK EAST.- .--- The Prime Minister said he had summoned a \The General Situation.   Cabinet because he had anticipated confident-ly that ^&amp;reply would be received from general sir Charles Harington which would probablycall for important decisions..     As yet, how-ever, this had not arrived.He then made to the Cabinet a statemen tregarding the general situation, to the follow-ing effect.     Mustapha kemal had paid no heedto the Paris Hote or to the warnings of general harington, and continued to pour cavalry and perhaps drtillery into the neutral zone.    Shesetroops were very insolent in their demeanour.They walked up to the \?ire entanglements ofthe British forces and made grimaces through them.     The General Staff had advised thatour troops were being netted in and that in ashort time this process would render them ineffeo-tive because the positions that were being taken up by the Turks would make their situationImpossible.     The three Staffs had examined thequestion and had considered it essential that something&apos;should be done to e2e ar up this situation.     The Conference of Ministers had therefore decided on the previous afternoonthat General Harington should arrange fox*not lee to be given to the local Commander ofthe Turkish forces outside Chanak. that if his troops were not withdrawn by a fixed time, allthe forces at our disposal - naval, military
and air - would fee used to reject them.    Ho thing hadbeen heard in reply to this telegram, which had been dispatched on the previous afternoon and this was ratherperplexing.   At the moment, therefore, there was no tilingto be done except to inform the Cabinet as to the genera^position.In r&amp;ly to various questions, he stated that asregards Prance, she had withdrawn her troops from Chanak IThe local Commanders had sent a contingent, but the FrenchGovernment had insisted on their withdrawal.     Since thattime they had offered us no support whatsoever.   At thepresent moment the French Government were supposed to bepleading with Mustapha Kernal in our interests and he hadno doubt that the French Government were doing their bestin this respect.     However, they were not helping at chanak.   Ihe Australian Government were willing tosend a force.     As regards the Americans, he had been impressed by a remarkable statement issued by Mr.Hearst.The Cabinet were informed by Cantata Guest, who had just returned from the United States of America, that hehad received a telegram from the Air Attache, whom he halgiven instructions to report on this question, to theeffect that the American press was displaying the greatestinterest and that a very large portion of it was favour-able to the British x^oliey and strongly opposed to thereturn of the Turks to Europe.The Cabinet were reminded that the American Govera-ment were sending destroyers.On adjourning, the Prime Minister asked -That all Cabinet Ministers should remain withineasy reach in case a further meeting of theCabinet was required the same evening.-a-

1. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs statedthat it was desirable that we should secure the evacuation of the refugees at Smyrna&quot;before&quot;Sep.tetuber 30ih ,    If, as was stated in that morning&apos;-.s -newspapers, the number leftwas only about 15,000, it should be possible to do this.It was important to consider what -would&apos; happen to these refugees on their arrival in Greece.   Mr Lindley had sug-gested that an Inter-Allied Commission, should be set up at Athens to arrange for the .relief of the refugees, and through .     ; ..that this might be dona       the league of Nations... It was agreed-- .That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should telegraph to Lord Balfour,asking him to. invite the League of. -     .. Nations to&apos; set.--.up machinery to. deal withthe relief of the refugees in Greece..
THE CRISIS 2.    The attention of the ConferenceIN THE near east, . was drawn to the fact that the invitation to Mustapha Kemal to the Conference agreedto in Paris on September 24th. providedthat, the line behind which the Greek troops were to retire should be fixed by theAllied Generals in a ccord        with theGreek and Turkish Military Authorities.No action, it was pointed out, had yet beentaken to invite a Greek General to theConference.      The Allied High commissioner at Constantinople, howevers had asked what action was being taken in this respectoIt was agreed :-(a)    That the War Office should askGeneral Harington to arrange forthe presence of a Greek General,(b)     That the Foreign Office should send a telegram to Athens on the subject.(?    Notify Paris and Rome).Greek Repre-sentationat theMudanlaConference.
3.     Apart from Conclusion S above, no oonclusionswere reaohed on the main subject of the crisis in the Sear East, but the following represents the trend of the discussion together with certaininterim steps decided on with a view to clarifyingthe situation at a farther meeting to be heldat 4 p*m*
(a) Tho primary British interests in thfc position in theHear Bast are -Boftpfthut our position is one ofmediators.     We, do not propose to use force to establish peace, either againsttho Turks or against the Greeks.   Thusif the Turkish Nationalists decline tomake peace, we shall not march an armyagainst them.    If the Greeks dealine,we shall not use our fleet to coeroethem.f111 The Freedom of the Straits: -   for this, asa great maritimdHSmpire primarilyinterested, we are prepared to use force,if neoossary.     We are not in a positionto send an army to protect the Bosphorus,hut we do intend to hold both sides ofthe Straits *(iii) TheM maintenance of the Allianoe with Franceand&apos;&quot;l:taly*&quot;&apos;&apos;&apos;:   Bui&apos;, while anxious that the&quot; Allied status should bo preserved at v allipoli, we intend to hold on to the gallipoli Peninsula, whether the Frenchdetachment now there remains or not.      .(b) In order to carry out the above policy it is essentialthat,.if serious fighting should occur at Chanak,mobilisation Should bo decided on and further reinforcements sent out, which involves the ,immediatesummoning of Parlianiont. jfo)    In regard to General Harington&apos;s proposal fin his telegram No.        viz. that tho Turkish nationalists- should be allowed to cross the Sea of Marmora,anywhere outside the aones which were declared bythe Allied High Commissioners to be Neutral in May./....-.,.19-El^it must be borne in mind that -(I) Wc are bound to be absolutely impartialand to givo fair play to both sides.&apos; ThusIf the Turkish Nationalists, a military Power,arc to be allowed to try and move their armiesinto Thrace, Greece, which is a naval Power.,must not be debarred from trying to prevent   ^ -them.     Consequently the proposal in sir horace Rumbold&apos;s telegram No.467 that Greekwarships should be withdrawn from the sea of Marmora must not be pressed, and the detention at Chauak of Greek transportsbound for the Sea of Marmora, announced in Sir Horace Rumbold1s telegram ltfo.465 of26th September, must oease, if GeneralHarington1s proposal is adopted.f ii) The Paris Note of -24th September, 1922,        &apos;&quot;.inviting Muetapha kemal to the Conference,specifically provides that the Government:of Angora shall not cross the Straits ortho Sea of Marmora,
(ill)     General Harlngton&apos;,s proposal would be contrary to the policy declared in the speech addressed to journalists by thePrime Minister on Saturday., September23rd in which he mentioned our desireto prevent the conflict from spreadinginto Europe.,      This, however, is probablycounterbalanced by a new factor, viz:the Greek revolution with the avowedobject of defending Thrace;(iv) Primary conditions of any consent tothe passage of Mustapha Kernel&apos;&apos;: s forces..to the neutral zone are that the Greeksshould have refused to withdraw behind the line to be fixed at the liudaniaConference and that the TurkishNationalists should have withdrawn   fromthe neutral zone..(d)     That., in order to assist the Conference in arriving at a decision, and without prejudice to their decision, the following draft telegramsshould be drawn up., to be based on the above,for consideration at a meeting to be heldat 4 penu(i) The War Office to prepare a draft telegram to General Harington informing him thatthe British Government favour his proposalsubject to the considerations set forth above.; that in view of the fact that theAllied invitation to Mustapha Kemalspecifically provided that the Governmentof Angora should undertake not to send troops to cross the Straits or the Sea of Marmorathe matter could only be settled afterobtaining agreement 7:ith the Allies; thatthe Allies were being consulted, and thata further communication would, be made to   -him as to the result; that if his proposal was agreed to by the - Allies,, - it we s presumed that his intention was to raise the natterat his proposed conference at Mudania,     Thedraft telegram should conclude by a statement on the lines of a draft read by Mrc Churchill,expressing appreciation of his forbearanceat Chanak and promising support and reinforce-ments if he is compelled to&apos; undertakehostilities,:(i&apos;i) By the Foreign Office informing Sir HoraceRuanbold of the above decision(ill)       By the Foreign Office approaching the allies in regard to the above proposalc(iv) By the Admiralty informing Admiral Brock of thesituation, and explaining that if GeneralHar&apos;ington&apos;s proposal should eventually be approved by the Allies, he should not in futureinterfere with the movements of Greek warships in the Sea of Marmora, or. with their passage through the Straits, provided that they under-took belligerent operations within the neutral zone.

The Conference agreed:-

(a) That the War Office should be authorised to make perfectly clear to General Harington,if it is not clear in his existing instructions, that he is at liberty to withdraw the British Forces from Constantinople, if they are required for the defence of Chanak or Galipoli, and that they should suggest to General Harington that he should warn the Genoral Officers Commanding the French and Italian Forces at Constantinople that this may be necessary in certain eventualities.

(b) That the War Office should send to General Harington a telegram expressing appreciation of his endeavours to avoid fighting at Chanak and of the forbearance displayed, and promising full support If he is compelled to fight as well as reinforcements. In addition the General should be told in the same telegram that the proposals. oontained in his telegram No.2485 (regarding the passage of Nationalist Forces outside the Neutral  Zones) is receiving careful consideration, and that the Cabinet wish before taking a decision to learn Sir Horace Rumbold&apos;s views on the subject; and that it is deemed undesirable that General Harington unaccompanied should meet mustapha Kemal. - If Mustapha Kemal should accept General Harington&apos;s invitation to meet him, the General should endeavour to utilise the opportunity to bring about the meeting at Mudania, to be attended by Greek as well as Allied and Turkish Generals, as proposed in the invitation sent from Paris on September 24, for tho sole purpose of fixing the line behind which the Greek army is to retire. 

c) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should send the British High Commissioner a telegram, containing a summary of the general considerations arising out of this day&apos;s meetings of the Conference of Ministers, and inviting Sir Horace Rumbold&apos;s views on General Harington&apos;s proposals.

Your 2485 cipher 27/9,      Your desire for solution is fully appreciated here and we are seeking oir EL BumboldTsadvice upon your proposals which will receive carefulconsideration: they raiso political considerations ef mostserious importance and can be discussed in telegrams betweenForeign Office and Rumbold in view of your military pro-occupations,.     Meanwhile we point out that Zemalrs argument which you think may be legally right fakes no account of the specific conditions regarding the 6traits and tho Marmora inthe Allied Paris note of 23rd SeptemberoWith reference to your ho. 1223 and proposed meeting with SJomal,  if he replies accepting the meeting, you should inform the Allied Generals and the representative of theGreek forces and arrange for their presence in accordancewith the allied Paris note.      It is undesirable to meet himseparately as this would be misunderstood by the Allies,Part II.     We are without information whether a clash hasoccurred at chanak,We warmly approve forbearance you have shown in face of repeated provocation and tho efforts you have made to avert hostilities.-   You;oan rely upon our whole-hearted support ifnotwithstanding your efforts, fighting breaks out or hasbroken out in the chanak zone or hostilities are forced upon you by attempts of the Eemalists to net you in.As
As soon as it is clear that our troops are seriouslyengaged we shall mobilise two divisions and call for extrarecruits so that reinforcements nay be sent you at theearliest possible moment and meanwhile, in order to reinforce Chanak; you may, if necessary, evacuateConstantinople and Ismid,,Our policy is to hold Galllpoli at all costs andto hold on to Chanak so long as this can be done without undue military risk.K0T3:In view of the particularly secret character of/&quot;this telegram, it has been given a strictly limited circulation and Members of Council are requested themselves to issue any necessary instructions to&apos;their directoratest
APPENDIX   Zt.Cypher telegram to Sir H, Rumbold (Constantinople).Foreign Office, 10.15 p.iiu 28th September 1922.Ho. 441.Cabinet have -given prolonged and anxious -&apos;consider a-tion to proposals made by Harington in his. telegram no, 2485.     &quot;We should have been glad if his views, whichhe&apos;had apparently communicated to you, had been accompan-ied by an expression of your/^Oplnion,&apos; the more so as theproposals made raise political issues of gravest importance,involving some departure from Paris agreement, andtherefore necessitating communication with our. allies.Harington!s first proposal is for a personal meeting with Mustapha Kernel.     Far&apos;Office has telegraphed to him^-that an independent meeting is inconsistent with paris agreement, but that we are entirely in favour of Mudaniameeting taking place at once under conditions laid down at-Paris and that if personal meeting be proposed it shouldbe converted into Mudania conference.Harington&apos;s second proposal is to fix line to whichGro k army are to be invited to retire at Maritsa River.Should the generals concur in this proposal at Mudania,and should the Greeks  accept it, no question  of amilitary crossing by Eemalists into Europe will arise,though in that case.wo shall have to provide forprovisional administration in evacuated areas, as contemplated in your telegram No, 469.      It seems tous useless to assign this task to Constantinoplegovernment, because in the first place we doubt their ability to carry it out, and secondly we doubt if Kernelwould agree.     He will no doubt express his opinions onthe/
the matter at Mudania, and final decision should not he made without reference to High Commissioners andto Allied Powers, since matter Is evidently politicalrather than military.In the contrary event of the Greeks decliningto accept Mudania decision, and refusing to wlth-draw,  anew situation is created, and Earington:s /plan for meeting it is not strictly in accordancewith Paris decisions.     He proposes  that passage of marmora should be permitted to kemal because the waters and coasts of the Marmora are not includedin the neutral zones which the latter has been told to respect.     As to this it must be pointed out(1) that the crossing of the Marmora at present state is expressly prohibited, in the: Paris terms and could only bo permitted with allied consent:(2) that it would involve consequences whichHarington has not fully&apos; foreseen and which mustbe carefully considered before proposal is made.The liberty accorded to Kemal could not in. logic;or fairness be unilateral.      If ho wore permitted to cross into Europe to fight the Greeks andanticipate the decision of peace oonforerico by establishing his rule in Eastern Thrace greek ships could not be prevented from.using non-neutral waters of Marmora at.same time,&apos;   .      .,      -    &apos;     . .... in/
in order to resist his passage: and embargo placed onGreek&quot;ships and transports would have to he withdrawn,In this way proposed plan might have consequenceof not only ire-opening war between Turkey and Greecebut of transferring theatre of that war to Europe withconsequences that cannot be foreseen,Those are the important considerations to Whichwe invite your attention and upon which we are reluct-ant. to decide until we have hoard your views.,Broadly speaking our policy should ba to adhereas closely as possible to Paris terms and only to contemplate departure from them whore such departureis made subject of allied consultation and can bejustified in interest  /of peace.

PROPOSED IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL OF GREEKS FROM EASTERN THRACE.

(f) In regard to the proposal contained in Sir Horace Rumbold&apos;s telegram No.474 of September 28th that the three powers should inform Greece that Greek troops should immediately be drawn behind the Maritza line the proposal of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was approved that he should reply by drawing Sir Horace Rumbold&apos;s attention to the sequence of events foreshadowed in the Paris note of invitation to the Conference. From this it would seem that the line behind which the Greeks were to withdraw was to be fixed by the Allied Generals in accord with the Greek and Turkish military authorities. The High Commissioner&apos;s proposal would be tantamount to a new concession to Mustapha Kemal at a time when he was flagrantly contravening the condition in the Paris Note that he should observe the neutral line, and the moment for putting pressure pressure on Greece would be after the line had been fixed.

GBEEK WARSHIP SAID TRANSPORTS ? THE STRAITS.

(g) In regard to Sir Horace Rumbold&apos;s telegram No.476, to take note that the question of the policy to be adopted towards Greek, ships in the Sea of Marmara had already been settled by the Conference of Ministers, and their decision had been communicated to the High commissioner in Foreign Office telegram No.442.

IMPORTANCE ? CHANAK.

?ply to French High Commissioner at Constantinople.

(h) In regard to the proposal of the French High Commissioner at Constantinople (Sir Horace Rumbold&apos;s telegram No.477) that the British troops might withdraw from Chanak if and when the proposed Conference met at Mudania), to approve the answer given by Sir Horace Rumbold, namely, that we could not withdraw as the Kemalists could then mount guns and be in a position to render the passage of the Straits difficult if they are dissatisfied with the progress of the Conference.

PROPOSED FRENCH AND ? NAVAL CO-OPERATION ?N THE STRAITS.

(i) In regard to the proposal contained in sir Horace Rumbold&apos;s telegram No.479 (which, it was noted had crossed Foreign Office telegram No.441) that the French and Italian Admirals should assist to prevent the passage in Europe of Mustapha Kemal&apos;s troops, that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should instruct the British High Commissioner formally to approach his French and Italian colleagues with a request for assistance by the French and Italian naval squadrons.

GENERAL TOWN TOWNSEND&apos;S OFFER TO VISIT MUSTAPHA KEMAL.

(j)That General Townsend&apos;s offer, made to the Lord Privy Seal, to proceed as an emissary of the British Government to Mustapha Kemal should not be accepted.
(k) To take note with satisfaction, that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs will shortly circulate to the cabinet a comprehensive Memorandum dealing with the question of the freedom of the Straits, and setting forth the meaning attached to this phrase by the British Government and by the Angora Government respectively.

?

(1) In view of the critical questions likely to arise for decision within the next few days, to instruct the Secretary :-

?

(n) to take note and approve of a correction to the draft Minutes of the Conference of Ministers on 27th September, 1922 at 7.0 p.m. proposed by the Lord Privy Seal to the effect that in the event of the evacuation of Constantinople it was for the army to provide transport and that the War Office should ascertain that the military authorities understood their responsibility in this respect.

The attention of the Secretary of State for War was particulularly invited to this.
BOARD OFIRA jE AID APOSSIBLE DEMANDFOR SHIPPINGTRANSPORT.&apos;lo) That, while at the moment, no instructionscould be given to -the Board of Trade inregard to any probable early demand for shipping transport, the Secretary of theCabinet should warn that Department thatduring the next two or three days officials should be In.-attendance or else at hand.in eaov. an -emergency&apos; recyr-i.^of transports should arise.4 v, ,the charter ingREQUISITIONING.Of SHIPPING.Pro pea ed tele-gram to theDominions.That the moment had not yet arrived for ending the draft telegram to &quot;the Dominions,attached to the Memorandum of die Secretaryof State for the Colonies, in regard tothe proposed draft Proclamation authorising the requisitioning of shipping.

THF SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that ? Chamberlain had agreed that the matter which he was about ? to the meeging was of sufficient importance to ?fy summoning the Ministers who normally attended the Conference dealing with the crisis in the Near East. At 4 p.m. he had seen Nihad Rechad, who was the Kemalist representative in London.

(Lord Birkenhead entered ath this point.)

? previously met Nihad Rechad in the Spring, when the ? had come to London with Yussuf Kemal Bey. Nihad was ?tlemanly, friendly, outspoken man, friendly to this ?ry, the more so as he aspired to be the future Turkish ambassador in London. Two days ago Nihad had asked if Lord Curzon would see him, and he had replied that he ?inly would. Nihad began by remarks in praise of what had been decided in Paris, which he thought was a work in the interest of peace, and he had congratulated Lord Curzonon the useful part he had played n reaching that agreement. Lord Curzon had then thanked Nihad, but took the occasion to ? him frankly that at the moment it hardly looked like ? and that we appeared to be on the brink of hostilities. ? replied by asking what on earth Lord Curzon meant? ? He replied that more, than a week had elapsed since the invitation was sent to Mustapha Kemal to a Conference at Venice and ?udania. During this period no reply had been received, and the only communication, had been to General Harington, ? a polemical character. If it was said that Mustapha ? was waiting for the arrival of M. Franklin-Bouillon, ? point out that the latter had reached Smyrna on ?day and that there had been plenty of time for an answer. ? meanwhile, what was happening on the Chanak front? Turkish forces had continued to advance to a point where ? were in close contant with British troops. They had ? reached the barbed wire of our position and were ? grimaces across it! This was in the nature of an
? movement and would soon involve extreme military ? our troops.

? Worthington-Evans entered at this point.)

?had then described quite frankly what had happened ? Cabinet that morning. The Government had been told by the ? y authorities that the position was inconsistent ? security of our forces. It had been tolerated up ? the present in the interests of peace, hut no-one could ? it  any longer. He had then told Nihad the steps that ? to be taken on the advice of the military authorities. ?the following day the General would demand the ? of the Turkish forces, and if this was not complied ? would he fired on. Nihad Rechad had replied, "But ? war". Lord Curzon had pointed out that at any ? rate it probably involved hostilities. Nihad had then said ? that he had not known that matters were so serious, and he asked permission to communicate this conversation to his ? Chief. Lord Curzon had replied that he hoped he would not ? only tell him this but that he would say a good deal more ? to Mustanha Kemal. He should point out that there had been no reply to  the Paris invitation. Why  asked Lord Curzon, was Mustapha Kemal not at Mudania? Where was he at the ? present moment? Nihad Rechad had then said that Mustapha Feral was at that moment in the train with M. Franklin-Bouillon on the way to Angora to consult the National Assembly. Lord Curzon replied that it was not his business to criticise the propriety of Mustapha Kemal&apos;s consulting his National Assembly, but he recalled that the Nationalist Cabinet had met at Smyrna and he had asked why Mustapha Kemal should not have gone to Mudania on his way to Angora? His whole attitude was consistent with a dilatory and evasive procedure. Nihad Rechad had then said that he was in contact with Mustapha Kemal, and that the latter was suffering under two great apprehensionss. First, he believed, that the British Government was in communication with and in a conspiracy with Athens,
and was organising Greek military aggression... so-as&quot;to., rendernugatory all the promises    ado at Paris in regard to ThraceLord Gurzon had mot this hy stating that we were not incowrhhicetibn with the n- Govwnment, for the reason,  if&quot;For non &apos; other, that no new Government,  so far as he knew,existed,  and he had ask-d what authority Nihad had for makjngsuch a statement.    Nihad had also said that the Britishwere organising the Greeks  in the Straits and in Thrace,lord Curzon had replied hy pointing out that we had actuallystopued transports goinp into the Sea of Har^ora and had insisted on the Greek warships leaving Constantinople. Hehad pointed out, however, that if events developed as theywere doing at the present moment, this attitude of restraint on the G-reeks would certainly not he continuedv and the verytosituation which fcbstapha JCeroal appeared to apprehend/existnow would he produced.    Nihad had .eplied that he was very glad to know this.    His second apprehension had been thatthe Turkish Nationalists were going to he cheated out of the. 1Paris decisions as regards Eastern Thrace, which would be rendered nugatory.    He thought that some sort of Governmentwould be set up there which would prevent  the Turks coninginto their cm.    Lord Cursor had replied that it was a curiousthing that he should attrition this today, because the question had only just been discussed at the Cabinet as to  the form of interim administration which should be set up during theConference in Eastern Thracef and he had telegraphed to constantinople that this administration would have to be mainly of a Turkish character.    If Mustapha Her al wanted tosettle these questions, why did he not go to Mudania, wireseverything could be a ranged?    Nihad Reohad had asked permis-sion to tell this  to *Iustepha Key-al, and he himself had agreed.Nihad had then said he could get in touch    ith *&apos;;ustapha Kemaiby the following nooning, and asked Lord Curzon what lie should say.    Lord Curzon had replied that it was not for him to say what account Nihad should give of his conversation, but as
regards the position of chanak he hoped he vo uld adviseMustapha Kemal that it was essential ho should order thelooal Commander to withdraw his forces at once, before firingstarted.    If, on the oth*r hand, he &quot;ras too late and firinghad commenced, he should admit that it was an error and give an undertaking that this was an isolat &apos;d incident which he regretted and that his troops would be withdrawn from theneutral zOn^.    Nihad had replied that he would do this.4LORD CURZON then said he wished to tell his colleagues the conclusion he had since drawn.    On the supposition thatthere was anything in what Nihad had said and that he didspeak the vi-rs of his Chief, he had said to himself, - was there not a possibility of escaping from the grave emergencythat would arise on the morrow?    Rven though the position ofthe Government was irrefutable --- and they had an admirableease to. make to Parliament   nevertheless they had to remember that a renewal of the -war with Turkey would be a most deplorable-. able occurrence and very unpopular.   He asked, therefore, ifIt would be possible to  suspend the orders to General Haringtonfor a short period, hy one of two methods:    either by holdingthe orders in suspense for 24 hours, or, if that was impossi- .&quot;ble, whether it would be practicable to tell the Commanderto extend the time limit given to the Turks by 24 hours?He felt that the answer to the question mainly rested withthe military authorities.   Would the delay of 24 hoursinvolve military danger?    Would the Turks  thereby be enabled to. dig themselves in and envelope our force and bring upguns,  and so  fo rth, and was&apos;the danger of this so great asto make it worth while to neglect this chance of obtainingpeace?    So many milifery considerations were involved thathe hesitated to express an opinion, but, subject to this, he felt strongly that if military considerations permittedthe attempt ought to be made, and, if it was made, that it. would immensely strengthen the Governrnent&apos; s public position.THE LORD PRIVY SFAL added that  just before Lord Curzonhad come to see him on this subject at   7-30, . his attention
had been called to the headlines in the evening newspapers to the effect that Komal accepted the Mudania Conference, "Better New", and so forth. All this was an ill preparation for the public reception of the decisions taken by the Cabinet that day. Then Lord Curzon had come to him and told him what he had just told the Conference. He had felt that it was too great a responsibility for any two members of the Cabinet to take, to decide the question raised by Lord Curzon. He had asked Sir Maurice Hankey to obtain the Prime Minister&apos;s view upon the subject, and Sir Maurice would no doubt communicate it later. He himself had told Lord Curzon that he appreciated the reasons in support of the suggested delay in taking action, but that after hearing the report of the Naval, Military and Air Staffs that day he had felt very doubtful whether military considerations would not render it impracticable. It might be that the additional time given would enable the enemy to dig himself in and bring up heavy guns and reinforcements. He had also asked Lord Curzon had replied that he thought he was. He did not ask if Nihad Rechad carried weight with Mustapha Kamal, but he would ask him that question. He felt the extreme difficulties that any postponement would create for Genearl Harington. It would give the impression of hesitating and of the Government saying at one moment that he was to act, and at the next that he was to delay. Moreover, he recalled that September 30th had several times been mentioned as a critical date. What he did not say, though he felt sure it was principally what was in the Prime Minister&apos;s mind, was that any delay would destroy the confidence of our representatives at Constantinople, who, on receiving the fresh instruction, would be much harassed by the succeeding orders and counter orders.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said that he had no doubt at all that Nihad Rechad was in Mustapha Komal&apos;s confidence, as he had accompanied his representative to London last March and had obviously been in his confidence also.
Y-Tben he had ashed Nihad: ^B:echa&apos;d^^&apos;r^lf&quot;&apos;&apos;llo^&apos;&apos;^waa -in- touch,-with mustapha Kemal he had replied that:he was.    He could nottell, however, whether he exerted any great influence with mustapha Kemal.   Nihad Rechad had said that he could eommu- -communicate-by wireless, and hoped to be able to reach hire at :-8 6f clock, the ne^t morning.    He wished to point out thathe had: not suggested a telegram of a discouraging character;all he had contemplated was that General Harington shouldbe told to allow an additional 24 hours to elapse before taking action.   Moreover,  everything ha had said was subjectto a military opinion, and if the military insisted that anadditional 24 hours would jeopardise the position it would greatly influence him.THE LORD CHANCELLOR agreed that the considerationsLord Ourzon had mentioned required oareful examination, huteven larger considerations were raised.&apos;   What new fact had arisen, he asked,&apos;- since the decision taken, that - afternoonwhich would justify a modification of the policy then decided?    One of the conclusions reached that morning hadbeen that .there should be a very short time limit locallyat Chanak,    The only question tonight was whether, they oughtto modify that time limit.    He had heard nothing which ledhim to think it ought to be modified in the slightest degree.If the case had Tven made that Nihad Rechad had swifteraccess to Mustapha Kemal than -General Harington had,  or that Mustapha Kemal had not been in a position to reply tothe communications addressed to him, th-&quot;re might be somecase for delay... As a matter of - fact, however, mustapha kemal had had the Allied invitation for the last six days;it was known- that he had received the invitation, and h-5 had given no answer whatsoever. &apos;  There was no reason why heshould not have replied that he was satisfied on this or that point but must make qualifications on another-,- and so forth.But he had done nothing at all&apos;. -  He-had received severalwarnings&apos; about&apos; the violation of the neutral zone, - but he had done nothing bat to equivocate,. procrastinate and defy us..-6- -&apos;-&apos;&apos;
TOR TiOB.fi PSWY&quot; SJRAL. interrupted to say that he had bie&amp;I -somewhat surprised that afternoon &quot;hen Lord. Soatty had saidthat Ivfustapha Kemal had received no ultimatum.    The OfficerCommanding at Chanak had intended to send him an ultimatumbut General Harington had stopped it, and he hies elf had examined th-- telegrams and to his surprise they confirmedLord Beatty&apos;s statement..   On-- of th&quot; telegrams from GeneralHaringto^ said that Mustapha Kern a 1 would be given 48 hours&apos;notice, but ther--- was no evidence that it had ever been sent.He thought, therefore, that Lord Beatty&apos;s statement was correct,THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that if that was the case hewas shocked       to hear it.    This night slightly weaken the presentation of the case, but it. did not alter our funda-raental position, which rested on tha non-violation of theneutral zone.   What was the position today?   Mustapha Kemalknew perfectly well the conditions of the Paris offer so faras the neutral zones were concerned,   &quot;hat had he done?    Hehad advanced his troops  through the neutral zone right up&apos; toour lines,  co- pletely ignoring the Paris condition that  &quot;Inr&apos; turn &apos;&apos;or this intervention the Government of Angora will undertake not to send troops either before or during theConfer--nee into the zones which had provisionally beenneutral&quot;, etc.    After we had committed ourselves to the paris Note our troops were now being netted in and blanketed,so that &quot;&apos;h-n the time came that they ought  to be able to make themselves felt they would not be in a position, to do so.    In24 hours ne: troops would be., arriving..    He -was by no meanssure that if w- delayed 24 hours-&apos;the spirit of thetroops might not be affected by the insolence of the Turks.He would no*- whittle down the decision which had been taken,and he had no doubt that Parliament and the public would support the Government if thfy proceeded with their plan.He was deeply desirous of averting war, and would go to greatlengths for this purpose,- but. he. did not think that war wouldbe- avoided by weakness of this kind.-7-
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said he had arrived at the same opinion. He was impressed by the fact that Mustapha Kewal had received the Paris message and had given no reply to it. The impression he got from the account of Lord Curson&apos;s interview with Nihad Rechad was that Nihad had been sent to "blind" London. All the information we had received was in accord with the secret information received that Fered Pasha in Paris had advised Mustapha Kemal not to mind our threats and to bring his troops close alongside ours, in the certainty that he would not be fired at. All indications of Mustapha Kemal&apos;s real attitude were to this  effect.   As regards Mustapha Kemal&apos;s suggestion, for example, that the British Government was in collusion with the new Greek Government, he pointed out that there had been no revolution in Greece until two days ago, yet for six days no reply had been received.  The Paris Note provided for the non-violation of the neutral zone, yet all the time Mustapha Kemal was pushing up men into it. He regarded Nihad Rechad&apos;s statement as probably being for the purpose of blinding us, when Kemal&apos;s real object was to get into Thrace. He was inclined to distrust Nihad&apos;s suggestions altogether.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said he was convinced that Nihad had not come with any instructions of this kind.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said he might be an unconscious agent. For his part, he thought that if the Government indulged in any further delay Mustapha Kemal would get enough men into the neutral zone to blanket us so that our force would be masked from effective action if and when the ? came.  He would be very sorry to postpone action.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS asked that the military view might now be heard.

THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that, as he conceived it,  the soldiers could only tell them as to the effect of the 24 hours&apos; delay.
THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY added, "And how far the position and moral of the forces at ? would be affected by delay".

THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL STAFF said that, as he read the situation,  the ultimatum left the War Office at about 4 p.?.  On an average of the time taken by these telegrams, it should be reaching General Harington at that very moment (about 11 p.m.)  The telegram was a definite, straight forward order. General Harington would at once issue orders to General Marden on the spot. He did not know how long, communication with General Marden would take, but it would take General Marden three or -four hours to communicate the orders to the troops and to  the Turkish local Commander. That would bring the situation up to 4 or 5 a.m. In reply to Lord Curzon, he said there was no day or night in carrying out military orders, and undoubtedly the communication would be made to  the Turkish Commander the same night. General Marden could be relied upon to take the quickest possible steps, as the whole tone of the telegram was in that order of ideas. However, it might be 5 or 6 o&apos;clock in the morning before he was ready. A counter order issued now could not, in his view, arrive in time to affect the situation. To issue a counter order after definite operation orders had been issued was fatal and most dangerous. As to  the situation opposite the wire, he had not been able to determine whether the Turks were close up to the four miles perimeter of the rain position or to the wire of the outpost line, the existence of which had only been learned that morning.  It might be that they were grimacing through the wire of this latter line. Every moment&apos;s delay meant a larger reinforcement to the enemy, and after tomorrow, when a Battalion of Marines was due to arrive, no further reinforcements would arrive before October 3rd; that is to say, the British forces were at the maximum immediate strength on the morrow.
This was not the case with the Turks, and there might he5,000 or 6,000 Turks there by this time. &quot;&quot;Ths^iimnediaterisk,  therefore, a?as that the Turks, whether they were4,500 or 6,000, would be  engaged with 3,500 British Infantry^It was true that General Marden might be able   to withdrewthe outposts tonight;    probably he would endeavour to do  so.If there were a  -further 24 hours&apos;  delay there was a grave danger that  the  rush, of the Turks after the capture of theoutpost line might enable the lurks to overwhelm us by forceof numbers.    In such a situation our own troops and the enemy would be inextricably mixed up, and artillery and machine-gunfire could do very little.    The only possible militaryargument he  could  think of in favour of delay was the factthat  the air fighting squadron, on which&apos; a good deal ofreliance was placed,   could not arrive until tonight ortomorrow.    If these aircraft were in action he would feelhappier as  to the situation.    His opinion,  however, was thatto issue a counter order now would be disastrous.THE SECRETARY OE STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said he hadnot suggested a counter o?.-der, but merely a delay in givingexecution to the order,TH&quot;&quot;&apos; LORD PRIVY SEAL thought that  Lord Cavan*s opinion was decisive.    A3 Lord Curzon had.said, both military andpolitical considerations were involved, and he himself had felt, with Lord Curzon,  that it would be right to do every-thing possible to preserve peace, provided that we did notendanger our hmops, but Lord Cavan&apos;s statement seemed toleave no doubt of this.THE FIRST  LORD OF mHE ADMIRALTY said he had reserved hisopinion deliberately until he had heard Lord Cavan, because he thought that military opinion would be decisive on thispoint.    The Government might not be forgiven if it did notmshe every  effort to preserve peace, but they would bo still less forgiven if they put our troops in jeopardyHe had
rather expected to hear tonight that there was a hew com-munication from Mustapha Kemal.    It transpired, however,that the position was precisely what it had been when the &apos;decision was taken that afternoon.    In the circumstanced,he felt sure the duty of the Government was to  adhere totheir decision,,THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that though he had urged the opposite view to Lord Gurzon, he was very glad that theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs had given an opportunity-nity for this discussion,THE SECRETARY OF SS&amp;TE FOR THE COLONIES said he sympathisedmost deeply with the Foreign Secretary, who was bound to assure himself, like.Sir w&amp;ward Grey in 1914, that no stonehad bee1&quot; left unturned to preserve peace, and he felt he hadthe full right to clear his conscience in the matter.   after all, it was his duty more than anyone else&apos;s*    He agreed,however, in the opinions expressed that it was not phyoicallypossible to defer action -without  the gravest risk.    It mightupset the whole situation.    It would almost certainly makeGeneral &apos;.Ha ring ton feel that he did hot know where he was.He would probably say. to himself that the Government had&quot;cold feet&quot; .   Moreover, a counter ord r issued at the last,moment might prove only partially effective.    consequently the Cabinet could not undo what had been done after very careful consideration, . He himself,  however,  did not take atragic view of the situation,. and had by no means lost hopethat there might still be a -peaceful: s ettlem ent.    He did notthink the act ion to be taken on the morrow would excludeconversations being reopened in a few days&apos;  time.    The Turksmight scurry of&apos;r with so e loss .    He thoug ht it quite-possible, however,  that this might not result&apos; in war.    It mustbe borne in mind that Mustapha kemal was at war with the greeks, and his  aim was i to pursue them into Thrace.   So faras he was concerned, the Whitish force at chanak was an
irrelevance.    He oould hardly beLieve that Mustapba Kemalwished to embroil himself with us .   7/hat-^hisbap-ha. Ke*malthought and what had been dinned into him was that theBritish could, be. trampled on and ignored-.   He rfiigh4r^^trjcyv0isthat  idea if a lesson were given him locally at chanak.    he recalled what- had happened in similar circumstances some two and a half years ago, when there had been an operation ofthis kind.    The decision had then had to be taken without consulting the Cabinet.    The Nationalists had lost about 100and we about 15 men, and the incident had closed.    He thought,therefore, there was a danger of exaggerating the situation.After all.  the Nationalists only had about 80,000 sabresand bayonets in all,  and they did not want to lose themfighting us..   Moreover, they did not want to waste ammunition,When Mustapha Kemal found he was up against people who would stand up to him. he might change his attitude, and Lord Curzoncould then again take up  the t lice ads of the peace settlement.THF LORD PRINT SEAL agreed that it was quite possiblethis might be the way to avoid trouble, but it was impossibleto let off guns without having in mind that greater eventsm.if&apos;b.i core out of it,THF LORD CHANCELLOR asked Lord Ourzon if he differed fromthe general view?THF SFCBFTAR^ OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said he hopedthat the decision would prove a wight one.    He was glad ofthe reception that had been given to his  action in takingwhat was, he  thought,  an obvious  duty.    He still had hisappr--h-nsioraJ but he thought the question was decided firstby the physical impossibility of corrrunieatingand, second,by Lord Cavan&apos;s strong belief that 24- hours, while addinglittle to our strength j might add considerably to that ofthe enemy. &apos; The course he had proposed,   therefore,  appearedimpracticable, and thrgy  could only hope for the best.tfw first LORD OF mh- ADMIRALTY, reverting to what mr churchill had said as to Chanak being an irrelevance from
