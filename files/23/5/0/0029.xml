WITH reference to War Cabinet 336, Minute 11, SirAuckland Geddes read a draft statement to be given to the press that evening. After discussion and amendment, the War cabinet approved the draft statement (Appendix) and its issue as an official statement in reply to Mr. Arthur Hendersons letter which had appeared in the newspapers that morning.The War Cabinet further requested Sir Auckland Geddes to get into touch with the editors ofsome of the London newspapers, -with a view to explain-ing to them the position of the Government in the matter.Strike of Sheet-Metal Workers.[1305-2. With reference to War Cabinet 336, Minute 9, the WarCabinet had before them the following documents : (a.) Memorandum by Mr. Barnes (Paper G.T.-3503).(6.) Minutes of an Interdepartmental Conference that hadbeen held that afternoon (Paper G.T.-3503a).Mr. Barnes said that, while he had formed the opinion that the strikers had no real case, forty-five out of the forty-eight firms concerned in the industry were already paying the Is. Id. per hour-337] B
minimum rate demanded from the remaining three firms. Thecase was further complicated by the production by Sir DavidShackleton, of a letter dated the 18th December, 1917, from theLabour Supply Department of the Admiralty, saying that theywould pay increased rates of wages in order to get the best men toincrease production, in defiance of the Treasury agreement of 1915.The Committee on Production had refused to assent to theincreased rate in the six cases which had been brought before them.The authority of the Committee on Production had been under-mined, however, by the fact that, in spite of their decision, firmshad paid the increased rate. At the conference that afternoon,which had consisted of Mr. Barnes (Chairman),Mr. Churchill,Sir George Gibb,Sir George Askwith,bir David Shackleton,Sir William Weir,Mr. I. H. Mitchell,Mr. H. Wolfe,Mr. H. J. Wilson,it had been unanimously decided that the contracting department should be given power to adjust the wages at the two firms wherethe disputes in question had arisen, and to settle other outstandingmatters in connection with the strike in any other Government or controlled firms. At the same time, the conference expressed theopinion most strongly that a more strict supervision should beexercised in regard to payment of wages by firms working for theGovernment, with a view to preventing increases which gave cause for subsequent trouble.In this connection attention was drawn to &quot;War Cabinet 317, atwhich it had been decided that &quot; All applications for an increase in war advances and wagedisputes arising therefrom shall be referred for decisionto the Ministry of Labour, who may refer them to theCommittee on Production. The Ministry of Labour willhave discretion to ask the Department concerned to carryon any necessary negotiations, but the final decision willin all cases rest with the Ministry of Labour.&quot;The War Cabinet approved the decision and recommendationof the conference, as stated above.Representation ofthe People Bill:proportional representation.3. With reference to War Cabinet 332, Minute 2, lord curzon stated that, in view of the rejection, by a large majority, inthe House of Commons of the Lords&apos; amendments to the Represen-tation of the People Bill in regard to Proportional Representation,the supporters of Proportional Representation in the House ofLords now realised that it would not be possible for them to securethe adoption of the principle on anything like the scale which theyhad suggested. They were now anxious for a compromise, anddesired to meet him on the following daj^, with a view to ascertain-ing the position of the Government in the matter.Sir George Cave stated that, in his opinion, any scheme which sought to dispense with local enquiry regarding the boundaries and composition of the boroughs or counties to which proportional representation: was to be applied would be rejected by the Houseof Commons. The only chance for Proportional Representationwould be in the adoption of some restricted application of theprinciple on an experimental scale, after due enquiry by a Conimis-sion.
The War Cabinet decided that Lord Curzon be requested to inform the supporters of Propor-tional Representation in the House of Lords that theGovernment were prepared to appoint a Commission to frame an experimental scheme for the application of proportional Representation to a limited number of counties and boroughs returning an aggregate of notexceeding 100 members of Parliament. Such a Commis-sion would be empowered to carry out the necessary localenquiries. On receipt of their report the Governmentwould undertake either to introduce a Bill on the same lines on which the Franchise Bill was introduced or tohave a resolution submitted to the House of Commons todecide whether a Bill should be introduced.The War Cabinet further decided that The Home Secretary should be present at the conference between Lord Curzon and the Peers who supported Pro-portional Representation.(Initialled) A.

APPENDIX.(See Minute I.)Official Statement issued to the Press.1. It is common ground that the Amalgamated Society of Engineers were metseparately on the occasions referred to by Mr. Henderson and that in the course ofthe meetings in April and May last year the Government undertook to issue, and did issue, instructions that until the original Schedule of Protected Occupations(M.M. 130) was revised, dilutees fit for general service in a given occupation shouldbe called up before skilled men or apprentices. This provision was of general application, and was not limited to members of the Amalgamated Society of engineers.   Under it upwards of 50,000 men have been called to the colours.It must be remembered that the original schedule provided that it was not intended at that time toi take men over the age of 32, and on the 10th May, at ameeting with the principal unions consituting the Federation of Engineering and shipbuilding Trades other than the Amalgamated Society of Engineers,Mr. Henderson explained that the instructions were not intended to apply to alldilutees up to the limit of military age.Mr. Henderson. &quot;May I tell you that in the negotiations which havetaken place during the past week that the demand was made upon the Govern-ment that no single man of a certain union whom you all know should be taken until every other diluted man was taken.....They say that not a singleman shall be taken from that union until every dilutee under 41 years of age,in harmony with the Military Service Act, is first taken. Well, the PrimeMinister may have said some strange things we all do; but he has1 not saidthat every man of 40 with his big family shall be taken before men of 19 or20 years of age are first taken.&quot;2. It is. common ground that Mr. Henderson, on behalf of the War Cabinet and members of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, signed a note stating that ithad been agreed that the instructions above referred to should be issued, and thata telegram should be sent by the Amalgamated Society of Engineers to their localofficials urging that there should be no stoppage of work.3. The Amalgamated Society of^Eng ^ers claim that the arrangements con-tained in the instructions specially^BaSiaBgto its members (statement by general secretary, A.S.E., issued to the press on the 19th January, 1918).   This is not so.At the conference on the 5th May one of the delegates put forward thefollowing suggestion: Mr. Bradley. &quot; May I put a question to Dr. Addison on his own state-ment? He has pointed out how essential it is that all the special parts ofmachinery should be placed at the disposal of the armies in the field. I would ask him if in the interests of the nation, seeing that on his own statementengineers are so essential in the workshop, would it not be advantageous tothe nation&apos;s welfare as a whole for the Government to contract with theAmalgamated Society of Engineers outside this Schedule M.M. 130 for totalexemption? &quot;Dr. Addison. &quot; I do not wrant to go into the case all over again. I thinkt-he answer to that is that you cannot contract with the Amalgamated society of Engineers only because there are a large number of other unions which haveskilled members who are involved.....You cannot limit it to termsof one union; it is really not possible.&quot;It will be seen that the claim of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers to special treatment was expressly rejected by the Government.4. The undertaking given by the Government that all skilled men would betreated alike was reaffirmed by Mr. Henderson at the conference with theEngineering and Shipbuilding Federation on the 10th May, 1917.     Referring to
the conferences which had been held with the Amalgamated Society of Engineers,Mr. Henderson gave the following reply: -A Delegate. &apos;- Could you tell us whether any agreement, or arrangement,or understanding was come to with that particular organisation (the Amal-gamated Society of Engineers), and if so will any arrangement made with that particular organisation be applicable to every other- organisation in theengineering trade? &quot;Mr. Henderson. &quot; With regard to the Amalgamated Society of Engineers,the negotiations with the delegates of that society, to which I have already referred, have been going on for several days, and&quot; they closed at 9 or a littleafter- on Saturday night. The reason why the negotiations have been so pro-tracted they began in the previous week was the determination of theGovernment to decline the request which was repeatedly made to us to abandon the schedule and to continue the trade card scheme. &quot; On behalf of the WarCabinet T told them as often as they put the question that their request couldnot be acceded to. They finally asked us what instructions were going to beissued for the application and administration of the schedule. We put beforethem the instructions that we had been busy drafting, instructions which hadto apply to every trade union, not only to them, because we are determined tocarry out loyally the arrangement which we have made, namely, that whateveris done in connection with the schedule and its working shall&apos;apply equitablyto all the trade unions alike.&quot;5. Mr. Henderson in his communication to the press contends that the Amahgamated Society of Engineers having been met separately last year ought to havebeen met separately in the recent conferences. One of the great difficulties in adopting this procedure has been the existence of a pledge given by Mr. Hendersonat the conference held on the 10th May, 1917.Mr. Henderson. &quot; We have issued these instructions and they are to applyto every society alike. The only arrangement we have made with the engineersis for the working of the schedule on these conditions. You will also notice thatwe have undertaken that before any departure from these instructions is madea conference of the trade unions concerned will again be held.&quot;ft was thus made abundantly clear last May that when it became necessary to alter the schedule the Government would meet not one but all the unions concerned.6. In accordance with the pledge given by Mr. Henclersen the Governmentinvited all the unions concerned to attend a general conference on the 3rd January,1918. When the Amalgamated Society of Engineers received the invitation to thegeneral conference they raised no objection, but attended.On the first day of the conference (3rd January), after a general statement had been made, the procedure to be adopted by the Conference was discussed, and itwas decided that for detailed discussion a series of group conferences should be held.In the proposal to meet by groups, Mr. Brownlie, chairman of the amalgamated society of Engineers, speaking on behalf of his society, concurred.Mr. Brownlie. &quot; The organisation which I have the honour to representaccepts the proposal put forward by Sir Auckland Geddes to meet in groupswith regard to his proposal as to a clean cut with reference to occupations.&quot;Notwithstanding this the Amalgamated Society of Engineers did not attend onthe second day of the general conference, and took no further part in its meetings.7. On the 17th January, 1918, Sir Auckland Geddes met certain officials of theAmalgamated Society of Engineers to attempt to find a way out of the impasse, and suggested that the Amalgamated Society of Engineers should meet the representa-tives of the Government, together with other representatives of the engineeringgroup, The officials suggested that Sir Auckland Geddes should receive a deputa-tion the following morning prior to his meeting the general conference.On the 18th January Sir Auckland Geddes received a deputation of officials anddelegates of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, and explained to them thedifficulties by which the Government was faced, and undertook to urge the confer-ence to approve the suggestion that the Amalgamated Society of Engineers should
join in a further meeting of the engineering group, or that in order to avoid the inconvenience of the whole group reassembling that the meeting should be withselected delegates of other unions. The conference, after considerable debate,were persuaded to endorse this proposal, conditionally upon a further meeting of theengineering group, and as the general conference would not reassemble, two repre-sentatives from each of the other groups being present. This decision and invitationwere communicated to the Amalgamated Society of Engineers and declined by themin letters which have already been made public.8. It is necessary to realise that the question at issue, although it concerns pro-cedure, is not a point of etiquette or punctilio. It is necessary also to realise thatthis is not a difference between the Government and one or more unions, but is a pointof difference between the unions themselves, and is regarded both by the Amalga-mated Society of Engineers and the other unions as involving a vital question ofprinciple. It is well known that great exception was taken to the action of theGovernment in meeting the Amalgamated Society of Engineers separately previously.The resentment of the other unions was based on the belief that the amalgamated society of Engineers used the separate conferences as a means to try and establish a special privileged position for their union, and to obtain special terms for theirunion. This was why the other unions, not only those in the engineering groups, but all the other unions attending the conference (upwards of ninety in number), insisted on the Amalgamated Society of Engineers not being treated as a separate group.The Government have done all they can to bring them together, and if the Amalga-mated Society of Engineers will now agree to meet with representatives of the other unions, or if the other unions will agree to the Amalgamated Society of Engineersmeeting the Government separately from them, the representatives of the Amalga-mated Society of Engineers will be given the fullest opportunity of making any statement they desire.While the Government is not only willing but anxious to meet the amalgamated society of Engineers, it must be remembered that a departure Prom the procedure adopted by the conference, unless with the sanction of the conference, would bedeeply resented by the other unions, which represent in the aggregate of membershipfar exceeding that of the Amalagamated Society of Engineers These unions take their stand not only upon the undertaking given to them in May by Mr. arthur henderson, speaking on behalf of the Government, but also upon their fixed resolvethat no privileged treatment shall be accorded to any particular organisation orclass.It is of the utmost importance that no question of procedure shall obscure the broad man-power issue. The broad issue is that if we are to obtain enough men tomaintain our armies in the field, we must withdraw from munitions a large numberof men who are fit for general service; and this number cannot be met simply by taking the dilutees. It necessitates taking also large number of young men who arenot dilutees, and who have hitherto been protected. The withdrawal of these menmust be so arranged as to reduce the output of munitions as little as possible, con-sistently with the army getting its recruits in time for the critical period. Mr.Henderson&apos;s quotation from the Government instruction as to the recruitment ofmen of lower categories appears to have little bearing on the point at issue.Men not fit for general service have not been withdrawn from munition works; noris it now intended to withdraw them. The instructions issued to the MunitionsArea Dilution Officers provide that, in selecting men fit for general service for release from the classes now rendered available under the revised schedule, theyshould be guided by consideration of the effect of such releases upon output, andthat in considering the order of release, dilutees, other things being equal1, shouldbe taken first.In this way, while it is not possible to give any specific pledge that the recruit-ment of dilutees can universally precede the recruitment of skilled men, the methodof recruitment is based on the principle of leaving the most essential men to the last.
