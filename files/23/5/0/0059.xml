During the night of the2nd February, the convoy was repeatedly attacked by submarines.The escorting vessel took no steps to drive off the submarines, and
WC 367did not give any orders to the ships, and was herself subsequentlysunk.

Admiral Hope added that since the 1st February, a systemof organised convoys had been established between these two ports,under British escort,The War Cabinet felt that this remarkable instance of Italiannaval incompetence ought not to be passed over in silence, andthat some action was called for.The Deputy First Sea Lord undertook to bring the matter tothe attention of the First Lord, with a view to drasticintervention with the Italian Government as regards their Naval Higher Command.SeaplaneEngagement.Persia.10: The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that a large&quot;America&quot; seaplane, on special patrol, had sighted two hostileseaplanes, which were engaged.

With reference to War Cabinet 360, Minute 9, the WarCabinet decided that The discussion on  Persian affairs should take  place  on\S   Thursday next.The Food Situation12. The War Cabinet decided that The question of food should be discussed on Friday next, withspecial reference to the following points: (a.) The proposal to separate supply from distribution.(b.) The readjustment of army and civilian rations.(c.) Potatoes.,The War Cabinet requested-Lord Milner to make a preliminary&apos; investigation on these subjects.Man-1&apos;ower:Supply of labour in Shipyards.(Shy/^2/313. With reference to War Cabinet 32b, Minute 19, the WarCabinet had before them a Memorandum by Sir Eric Gedcies(Paper G.T.-3949), and a Note by the Secretary (Paper G.T.-3963), with reference to labour for merchant shipbuilding.ft was pointed out by the Minister of National Service thatthis was a very large and complicated question. An arrangement was in force whereby the release for the armed forces of menunder Schedule covered skilled, semi-skilled, and unskilled men,and on this Schedule the whole supply for the Navy, Army, andAir Force was based. He stated that in the Army it was estimated that there were roughly only 5,000 to 6,000 menwho had been skilled shipyard workers before enlistment, and ifit was intended to supply the shipyards with skilled men above this number it would be necessary to take men of the tradealthough they had never worked in shipyards before thewar. He emphasised the fact that if such men were taken from the Army and the Air Force, the Air Force wouldbe utterly shattered, and the artillery in the Army seriously affected, and that if such men were obtained from munition factories by transfers, the whole basis of recruiting wouldbe affected. Pie also said, that the Navy had taken action whichseriously interfered, with the supply of men for the forces. Hewas strongly of opinion that if any centra,! Department moved,without consulting the Ministry of National Service, the whole
position would become impossible. He suggested that it would be advisable to ascertain the number of skilled shipyard workers atpresent in the forces, and stated that it was not desirable to takemen, as was being done now, from the forces, who were semi-skilled or unskilled for work in shipyards.The Adjutant-General stated that the Army were nowreturning men more quickly than they could be used in the ship-yards.Sir Alan Anderson pointed out that, while this statement was quite correct, owing to a delay caused by the distribution of menthrough Labour Exchanges, the matter had now been put right. he also stated that there was a greater output in the year 1917, with less skilled men, than ever before.During the course of the discussion it was pointed out that if,all the skilled men who had been trained in the army and the AirForce were taken, it would be impossible to replace them.The First Lord of the Admiralty insisted on the importance of skilled men being released not only from the Home Forces but also from the forces abroad, in view of the fact that considerable time would be lost if only the Home Forces were dealt with first, andthen the forces overseas later.The Adjutant-General stated that the card index gave thenumber of 20,000 such men available in the army, but of these therewas a certain proportion who did not desire to be returned to civil life.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To adhere to their previous decision, that the construc-tion of ships should have the first claim on man-powrerafter the fighting requirements of the Royal Navy andthe Royal Air Force.(&amp;.) That the Minister of National Service should undertaketo do his best, in co-operation with the other Depart-ments concerned, to obtain men for the ship.yards,which, inter alia, will involve the release, at theearliest possible elate, of all men who were skilled ship-yard workers or apprentices before they entered theService; the term &quot;shipyard worker &quot; being under-stood to include all skilled workers on bull construc-tion and repairs.(c.) That the Secretary of State for War, on behalf of theArmy Council, should do his utmost to release theabove men from the forces at home and overseas, in allcases where this can be done without really seriousdetriment to the efficiency of the forces.(d.) That the First Lord of the Admiralty should give asimilar undertaking on behalf of the Board ofAdmiralty.(e.) That the Secretary of State for the Air should co-operate in the same manner.(/.) That men should not be released who are employed attheir trades with the Navy, Army, or Air Force, or who are fit for General Service and are under the agesspecified in the Revised Schedule of Protected Occupa-tions (M.M.-130 revised)(g.) That the First Lord of the Admiralty should furnish theWar Cabinet with the state of all personnel in thenavy, giving medical categories, on the same lines asthat given by the War Office, and working in concert with the Adjutant-General.(h.) That no figures should be given in the House of commons as to the number of men which were to be released forthis work.
Assistance inAviation to norway.3.14. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byLord Rothermere on the question of continued assistance to theNorwegian Government in the matter of aviation (Paper G.T.-3908), in which the War Cabinet were asked for a decision asto whether the facilities given in the past in the way of traininga small number of pilots, supplying drawings of aeroplanes, and,in a few cases, complete aeroplanes, should be continued.General Trenchard pointed cut that the Air Council wereadverse to continuing assistance, because it appeared that, ifNorwegian pilots had the benefit of training in the UnitedKingdom, there was a risk amounting almost to a certainty thatGermany would obtain particulars of this training.Lord Robert Cecil said that, on the other hand, it seemed likely that if these facilities were abruptly stopped, it would havea, bad effect on public opinion in Norway. Pie would prefer to delay sending manuals, machines, &amp;c, rather than make a suddenchange.The War Cabinet decided that Without abruptly discontinuing facilities to the norwegian government, the Air Council should, as far as possible,delay sending manuals, and in any case should only send the old type of machines.British Supremacyin the Air.15. General Trenchard, in reply to a question as to why theBritish and German reports of aerial engagements differed sowidely, said that, whereas the British reports differentiatedbetween cases of &quot;&quot;crash &quot; and being driven down &quot;out of con-trol,&quot; the German reports claimed &quot;out of control&quot; cases as&quot;&apos; crashes.&quot;   Experience showed that, on an average, about 50 percent, oxtheouof control&quot; cases recovered.   With regardrecent, air fighting, while it was perhaps too much to &apos;?ay that i ursuperiority in the air had delayed the expected German offensive,nevertheless it might have been a factor in the delay. In anycase the German inferiority must have proved a source of difficulty to their artillery and to their aerial photography.Restrictions on Use 16. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theof Gas and President of the Board of Trade in regard to Restrictions on UseElectric Light. of Gas and Electric Light (Paper G.T.-3885).Sir Albert Stanley said that the result of withdrawingcoasting steamers, normally bringing coal to London and the Southof England, for the purpose of conveying coal to Italy, via France,was that there must be a severe restriction on the use of coal; a drastic reduction in the amount of gas and electricity used forlighting and power had become necessary. He proposed thatan Order should be issued prohibiting shop-window lightingthroughout the country. He further stated that it had beensuggested that lights should be extinguished in the public roomsof restaurants, hotels, and clubs at 10 cfclock, and that all places of amusements should be closed at 9.80 p.m.On this point the War  Cabinet were of opinion that 9.30appeared to be too early an hour.   They suggested instead that10.30 would be a suitable hour for closing theatres.-  The War Cabinet authorised The President of the Board of Trade to proceed on these lines,and agreed to the other proposals contained in his Memo-randum on the subject.[1365-367]C
Rationing of Goal 17. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum pre-for Domestic Use.    pared by the Coal Controller in regard to the rationing of coal for domestic purposes (Paper G.T.-3898).Sir Albert Stanley said that the only safe course to adopt wasto ration coal supplies. This had already been done with&quot; respectto household coal in the metropolitan area, without experiencingany serious difficulty or causing any disturbance. It was now pro-posed to extend the scheme, which had been in effect in the metro-politan area-, to the whole of England and Wales (exclusive of cer-tain coalfields), subject to such improvements as had been sug-gested to those engaged in the work since August last, when it. , was first instituted. . The rationing of industrial coal (except forminor or domestic industries) was deferred, for the moment. the saving to be made on domestic coal was estimated at about,000,000 tons per annum.The War Cabinet agreed to the proposals contained in they&apos; Coal Controllers Memorandum on this subject.18. The War Cabinet had before them various Papers (G.T.3430,  3749, 3903, and 3929)  in regard to making the BritishExecutive Staff of the Commission Internationale de ravitaillement-nieht responsible in. future to the Foreign Office instead of to theBoard of Trade, as in the past.The President of the Board of Trade, Lord Robert Cecil, andSir E. Wyldbore Smith, all expressed their agreement to the pro-posed transfer, and the War Cabinet decided /t/&apos;      That the change should be made.Commissioninternationale deEavitaillement.19. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byGeneral Smuts (Paper G.T.-3939) and Minutes of a Conference(Paper G.T.-394-2) in regard to the Intelligence Bureau of theDepartment of Information.The War Cabinet requested Lord Robert Cecil to confer with Lord Beaverbrcok on theS* subject.IntelligenceBureau of theDepartment- ofInformation.Control-of Road 20. With reference to War Cabinet 331, Minute 9, in whichTransport. the War Cabinet, at the instance of the Board of Trade, decidedto set up a Road Transport Board, the War, Cabinet had beforethem a Note by the Secretary (Paper G.T.-3959), in which it was stated that the Minister of Reconstruction had called attention to two points not dealt with in the War Cabinet Minute.In Dr. AddisoiTs opinion (a.) The new organisation should not prejudice any systemof transport that may be considered advisable duringthe reconstruction period; and(&amp;.) It should be limited to the duration of the war, unless anarrangement continuing it be made with the con-currence of the Minister of Reconstruction.The President of the Board of Trade stated that he saw noobjection to the first point raised by Dr. Addison, but was ofopinion that the second should be decided by the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet gave their approval to his suggestion on both points.
21. The War Cabinet approved the appointment of the f follow-g Committee to deal with the proposed new pensions warrant: Mr. Barnes (Chairman),Mr. Hayes Fisher,Dr. Addison,Mr. Hodge,Sir Robert Chalmers (representing the Treasury).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March 19, 1918.
