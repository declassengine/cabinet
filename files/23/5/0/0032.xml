THE Director of Military Intelligence reported that on the28th January Sheriff Abdullah El Fair captured El Mezra, taking00 prisoners, 10 tons of grain, 6 dhows, and sinking 1 launch.This operation was in every way successful, and it was pointed outthat El Mezra,, although small, was an important harbour, formingthe outlet, of an important grain-producing region. This action was the sequel to a Turkish attack from Kerak on the Arabs atSeil El Hesas on the 26th January, when the Arabs had capturedtwenty-three machine-guns. In the engagement at El Mezra onlyforty Turks managed to escape, and their total losses were esti-mated at between 600 and 700.
Transfer of german divisions to theWestern Front..-Vy7-2. With reference to War Cabinet 336, Minute 1, the Directorof Military Intelligence stated that no more German Divisions hadbeen moved to the Western front, and that the total still remained at 173. Since October last thirty German divisions in all had beentransferred to the Western front, and the Director of military intelligence estimated that, if they wished, the Germans couldmove twenty-seven more. The Italian front had been depleted,and not more than three, and probably only two. German divisionsremained there.Possible german attack on theWestern Front.yL^-*^&amp;.3. With reference to War Cabinet 336, Minute 3, in reply to aquestion, the Director of Military Intelligence stated that hethought the Germans would make a big attack in the West at sometime or other, but he could form no opinion as to the probable dateof this attack.The Prime Minister stated that General Smuts, who had recently visited Prance, had drawn his attention to the weakness of that part of the line held by the Portuguese.The War Cabinet requested The Chief of the Imperial General Staff to enquire into thequestion of the risks and possible consequences of anattack by the Germans on that part of the line held bythe Portuguese, and the arrangements made to provide against the contingency of a reverse in this sector.British divisions on the italian front.4. The Secretary of State for War stated that, with referenceto the decision to reduce all British divisions from a strength of twelve battalions to nine, he had received a communication fromGeneral Plumer saying that if this order was applied to theBritish divisions now in Italy it would have a bad moral effect onthe Italians.The Director of Military Intelligence said that General Har-rington, General Plumer&apos;s Chief of Staff, was now on leave inEngland.The War Cabinet therefore requested (a.) The Secretary of State for War to ask General Harring-ton to attend a meeting of the War Cabinet at an earlydate, in order to discuss with him the reduction of theBritish divisions in Italy.(b.) The Secretary of State for War to telegraph to general plumer saying that the order regarding the reductionof British divisions in Italy was to be suspended untilthe War Cabinet had interviewed General Harrington,when definite instructions would be issued.The Transport&quot; Tuscania.&quot;    f/5. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff stated that the trans-port &quot; Tuscania,&quot; carrying 2,400 United States troops, was tor-pedoed on the 5th February off the north-east coast of Ireland.Although full details were not yet available, he believed all onboard would be saved, and it was reported that over 2,000 troopsy had already been landed.Lobs ofMediterraneanConvoy.6. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff reported that a convoy of three British and two Allied ships, under Italian escort, hadbeen attacked and sunk in the Mediterranean.    The leader of the convoy had also been torpedoed.     No further details were yetS available.
The War Cabinet directed The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff to telegraph to the FirstLord of the Admiralty, who is in Italy, a request that hewould enquire into the facts of this incident.Russia:Suggested PartialRecognition ofBolshevik Govern-ment, and Positionof Mr. Lockhatt.07. The War Cabinet had before them telegram No. 304, datedthe 5th January, Petrograd, which contained the suggestion thatHis Majesty&apos;s Govesrnment should extend the authority given toMr. Lockhart as intermediary between the British Embassy inPetrograd and the Bolshevik Government, and thereby pave theway for a fuller understanding with the Bolshevik Government.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that hethought that Mr. Lockhart might be given political credentials,in addition to the commercial credentials which he already pos-sessed, without our being committed to full recognition of theBolshevik Government.   Mr. Lockhart was not now in the same position as that occupied by our Consul at Helsingfors, who dealtdirect in a political capacity with the de facto  Government  off inland.     Similarly, our late Consul-General  at Odessa, Mr.Bagge, was now at Kieff in direct relations with the  de  factoGovernment of the Ukraine.&apos;    He suggested that Mr. Lockhartshould be placed in an analogous position in regard to his dealings with the de facto Government in Petrograd.   Tt was not possiblefor us to recognise the Bolsheviks as the governors of the whole ofRussia, as the whole of Russia did not acknowledge their autho-rity; besides which, such recognition would be clearly incompatible with the modified degree of recognition and support which we hadbeen, or were, giving to the Ukraine and the Don Cossacks.    by taking the step suggested, we did not either support or condemnBolshevism as such, but merely facilitated dealings with the defacto Government in Petrograd.     At any moment an incident,either in Russia or in this country, might precipitate the breakingof the very fragile thread which maintained relations between HisMajesty&apos;s Government and that of the Government at PetrogradWe clearly could not go the full length of accrediting an Ambas-ambassador in Petrograd. and his proposal would put our de facto rela-tions with all the de facto Governments in Russia on an equality.With regard to the suggestion that by according this new authority to Mr. Lockhart, we should be enabled to arrive at some under-standing with the Bolshevik Government in regard to the cessation of their efforts to spread Bolshevik propaganda in this country,it was, in his opinion, illusory, as. in the event of such an under-standing being published in Russia, the whole basis of the positionof MM. Lenin and Trotzki would be gone, the whole essence of theBolshevik creed being that the various belligerent nations shouldmake peace with one another as soon as possible, in order that the class war could be begun in all countries in place of the national war.   He further realised that, in any attempt on the part ofMr. Lockhart to come to an understanding with the Bolsheviks,the question of boundaries of Bolshevik authority in Russia would prove a stumbling-block to any practical arrangement,   Finlandalone had a clearly defined boundary, the Ukraine and Cossackcountry had no clear boundaries.Lord Robert Cecil said that he doubted whether it wasjudicious that anything should be done to please or encourage a Government which was behaving in such a manner. Suchaction might discourage what remained of the anti-Bolshevikelements, such as the Poles and Cossacks, and might prove helpful in the spread of Bolshevik propaganda in this country, as also inFrance and Italy. In Italy the danger of the spread of Bolshevik propaganda was serious. Further, it looked as if M. Trotzki,at any rate, had taken German money, and that there was little chance of M. Trotzki being either willing or able to hold out
against a separate peace. As he read Mr. Lockhart&apos;s telegram,he thought the latter was seeking something further than thatwhich had been adumbrated by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.The Prime Minister expressed the view that it was no concern of the British Government what socialist experiment or what form of government the Bolsheviks were trying to establish inRussia. In this connection he read an extract from page 42 ofa book entitled &quot; The Elements of International Law,&quot; by GeorgeB. Davis, an American authority on these questions, in which itappeared clear that recognition of one Government by anotherdepended entirely upon de facto conditions. In regard to theparticular question before them, it was necessary to bear in mind that the Bolsheviks were a formidable menace to Austria andGermany, and that our information regarding the internal con-ditions in Austria was such as to encourage the view that theinternal political condition of that Empire was seriously em-barrassed by the spread of Bolshevism. Further, from a letter hehad seen regarding conditions in Germany, it was apparent thatthe dominant factor in German politics to-day was the Brest-Litovsk situation. He had no fear that Bolshevism was a formidable-able menace to the internal peace of this country. The recentby-election at Prestwich, in Lancashire, showed that, even in an industrial constituency, the vast majority of the nation were opposed to revolutionary ideas and in favour of carrying on thenational war to a successful issue. He therefore thought thatthe grant of fuller authority to Mr. Lockhart might prove a usefulopportunity for getting certain conditions agreed to by theBolshevik Government in regard to their non-interference in theinternal politics of Allied countries. He was also most anxious that the War Cabinet should not refuse the advice tendered tothem by the British representatives in Russia, and he instancedseveral cases in the past where he thought errors had been madein refusing to accept such advice. The opinion he had formed ofMr. Lockhart was such as to cause him to hesitate before rejectingany advice he offered.Lord Curzon stated that he thought it would have a veryunfortunate effect in this country, and in Allied countries, if we took any step in the direction of further recognition of theBolshevik Government at a moment when it appeared likely thatM. Trotzki was effecting a separate peace with Germany. Hehad spoken to Sir George Buchanan on the previous day regard-ing the proposal contained in Mr. Lockharfs telegram, and hadgathered that Sir George Buchanan was of the opinion that anyfurther recognition of M. Trotzki would help Germany.Similarly, any recognition of the Bolsheviks would assist in the spread of their propaganda in this country, and therefore headvocated the taking of the more cautious line.Lord Hardinge pointed out that full recognition of theBolsheviks was not suggested. &apos;Full recognition would involvedirect dealings between Mr. Lindley and M. Trotzki, whereas the degree of recognition advocated by Mr. Lockhart left all dealingsin the hands of an intermediary.The War Cabinet requested The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to prepare adraft reply to Mr. Lockharfs telegram, for their furtherconsideration.
8. The War Cabinet had before them a copy of the following-telegram from the Right Hon. Arthur Henderson, M.P., to M.Lenin, at Petrograd, which was being held up by the Censor(Paper G.T.-3546):-&quot; British Labour Movement invites your party senddelegates Inter-Allied Conference, London, Wednesday,February 20th. British movement secured general agreement on War Aims propose this document form agenda. Stronglyhope your delegates can attend secure full representation all allied sections preliminary full international.&quot;The War Cabinet decided Not to prohibit the despatch of this telegram.9. The War Cabinet had before them a telegram fromGeneral Ballard to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (B.A.922), dated the 5th February, 1918, and a telegram from sir george Barclay (Jassy, No. 94), dated the 30th January, 191S,regarding the possibility of Roumania making a separate peace.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read to theCabinet a telegram (which had been received while the cabinet was sitting) from M. Bratiano, the Prime Minister of Roumania,stating that an ultimatum had been received from General vonMackensen, conveying notice of the termination of the armistice,and threatening military consequences should peace not be effectedforthwith.General Macdonogh stated that, as far as the military situa-tion was concerned, General von Mackensen&apos;s ultimatum was abluff. The Roumanians had fifteen good divisions and threeothers in course of formation, which were opposed by not morethan twelve enemy divisions, five of which were Austrian and seven German. The Austrian divisions were extremely poor in quality, having been extensively combed out. The only mainmilitary danger to Roumania, as long as her armies could besupplied from Bessarabia, was an advance from the Bukowina,where, however, there were only ten indifferent Austrian divisions.There were no German divisions on this front, and it would takea considerable time for the Germans to concentrate an armysufficiently strong to deal with the Roumanians.Mr. Balfour added that the French took the strongest possibleview that the Roumanians should be discouraged from making aseparate peace. However, if they insisted upon doing so, hethought it should be made quite clear that the Allies would be released from their treaty obligations to Roumania in regard tothe undertaking given to Roumania when she entered the War.The Cabinet decided that The Foreign Office should send a telegram to our representa-tive at Jassy, pointing out the reasons which HisMajesty&apos;s Government had for considering General vonMackensen&apos;s ultimatum a bluff, and informing him ofthe serious internal condition of Austria-Hungary, andinstructing him to urge the Roumanian Government to refrain from making a separate peace.10. The Secretary asked for a decision of the War Cabinetin regard to sending a telegram to the Dominions Governmentscontaining the gist of the conclusions reached at the recent meet-ing of the Supreme War Council at Versailles.The War Cabinet agreed that The Secretary of State for the Colonies should send a tele-cram, which the Prime Minister undertook to draft.   82, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,February 7, 1918.
