The French attack west of Noyon was still proceeding.Eighty-two German divisions had been identified, and thetotal number of enemy divisions engaged probably numbered 90,leaving from 5 to 8 entirely fresh divisions still to come in. after this the roulement would begin.At a later stage in the meeting the Director of MilitaryOperations reported that north of the Somme there had been nofurther enemy attacks, and the situation appeared to be well inhand.

The Wax Cabinet had some discussion on the qu&amp;oufurther appeal to the Dominions for increased effort in recruiting,along the lines which would have to be adopted in this country.In this connection Lord Derby said that he had seen sir edward Kemp on this subject, who had informed him that every-thing possible was being done in Canada, and that it therefore didnot seem desirable to approach the Canadian Government officially,but urged that a personal telegram should be sent by the PrimeMinister to Mr. Hughes on the subject.The War Cabinet were of opinion that some message shouldbe sent to Australia.The Prime Minister undertook to send a personal message toMr. Hughes on the subject.6. With reference to War Cabinet 374, Minute 9, the PrimeMinister informed the War Cabinet that a message had been pub-lished in Washington from President Wilson congratulatingGeneral Foch on his new appointment. The Prime Minister addedthat the Press Bureau wished to know whether such messages wereto be published in this country, or whether the British Governmentwere going to make any announcement on the subject.The War Cabinet were of opinion that an official announce-ment should be made in this country as soon as possible to thefollowing effect: &quot; That, with the cordial co-operation of the British andFrench Commanders-in-Chief, General Foch had been charged by the British, French, and American Governments to co-ordinate the action of the Allied Armies on the western front,&quot;The War Cabinet decided that-President Wilson&apos;s message should be kept back from publi-cation, and that the Foreign Office should inform theFrench Government that we are going to make anannouncement immediately in our press:Message to thePress.7. In addition to the announcement authorised in the pre-vious Minute, the War Cabinet decided That a statement should be issued to the press in the sense that, since the commencement of the German attack, theWar Cabinet has been in constant session. They havetaken many decisions dealing with the immediate situa-tion; they have dealt with the question of despatchingreinforcements and guns to replace losses; they also have in course of preparation a series of measures for dealingwith the situation in the future for the supply of largenumbers of men and guns to maintain our army through-out the summer. These measures will necessarily take afew days to prepare, and they will be announced, so faras is in the public interest, when Parliament meets.The War Cabinet also decided that The Prime Minister should settle the wording of thesemessages, and then they should be issued.
Assistance by theUnited States :Meeting of theSupreme WarCouncil.-   &quot;5.8. With reference to War Cabinet 377, Minute 7 (a), it wassuggested that, should there be any reluctance on the part of theAmerican Government to comply with the proposal put forward,it might be desirable to convene a Special Meeting of the supreme war Council, either at Versailles or some place more convenient to General Foch, which should be attended by Generals Pershingand Bliss, and Mr. Baker, the American Secretary for War.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said he was infavour of such a plan, having regard to the fact that PresidentWilson had all along been a supporter of the Versailles Council.Withdrawal ofMen from theAdmiralt)&apos;.Eussia:japanese intervention.9. With reference to War Cabinet 372, Minute 22, the WarCabinet had before them an Admiralty memorandum in regard tothe contribution of approximately 12,500 men by the Admiralty&quot; A &quot; firms (Paper G-.T.-4067). In this memorandum it waspointed out that, unless the Minister of National Service divertedsuitable substitutes to Admiralty firms quickly and in sufficient numbers, output would suffer seriously. The Admiralty, however,did not wish to oppose the contribution of 12,500 men, but merely to warn the Government of what would, in their opinion, be theconsequences. The Minister of National Service recognised thatan adjustment to marine engineering will be necessary not only as regards the men to be taken away under the scheme, but also as regards the additional men who will shortly be required. Thememorandum also pointed out that there would undoubtedly bean outcry from the employers who are primarily responsible&apos; forthe output of marine engines, which must be set off against anybeneficial effect on the A.S.E, The Admiralty considered thatthe method of levy should be to take a uniform percentage of thetotal number of male employees of every engineering firm, andthat before a pivotal man is called up the employer shall have aright to appeal. The Ministry of Munitions had stated thattime would not permit of this protracted procedure.The War Cabinet, in reaffirming their decision that the12,500 men should be contributed, took the responsibilityfor whatever consequences might follow.10. With reference to War Cabinet 369, Minute 9, the WarCabinet had under consideration Lord Curzon&apos;s Memorandum onthe question of Japanese intervention in Siberia and our policy inRussia (Paper G.T.-4046).Reference was made to the latest telegrams that had been exchanged between this country and America on the subject, aswell as to telegram No. 291 from Tokio, and to Mr. Lockharfsrecent telegrams from Russia (e.g., No. 42) indicating the possi-bility that the Bolsheviks might yet be persuaded themselves to invite the assistance of Japan.The view was expressed that it would be fatal if, now thatM. Trotzki and the American Government were.coming round toa view less hostile to Japanese intervention, the Japanese Govern-ment should decide not to intervene.The War Cabinet decided that, if this had not already beenclone The Foreign Office should inform His Majesty&apos;s ambassador at Tokio of the latest telegrams received from Mr. Lock-hart, indicating that the Bolsheviks were regardingJapanese intervention in a more favourable light.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.IF.,March 30, 1918.
