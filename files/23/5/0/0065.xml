Clemenceau,Sir Douglas Haig, Sir Henry Wilson, General Foch, and general petain. The Conference would discuss the question of greater co-ordination in the command of the Allied troops on the western front. Sir Douglas Haig had expressed hfmself as feeling thenecessity for some such co-ordinating authority.German Reserves. 2. The Director of Military Operations reported that the germans were drawing their reserves from all parts of the Western Frontfor the battle.   They had withdrawn 15 divisions from the French[1365-373]The western front:Conference atDoullens.
front, and 17 from our front north, of Arias. The number of german divisions identified in the battlefield since the beginning of thepresent fighting was (12, of which at least 15, and.probably more,had been withdrawn. It was probable that the actual number ofGerman divisions engaged or near the battlefield was over 80. Inthe confusion of battle it was difficult to obtain definite information,but it appeared safe to estimate that there were at present 52German divisions opposed to our forces between Arras and theOise. Against these forces we had 34 divisions, of which 7 hadbeen withdrawn. Our figures include 2 French divisions, but notthe other divisions on their way. It must be remembered that theGerman divisions are of slightly less strength than ours.The Director of Military Operations reported that two divisions the 12th and the New Zealand Division referred to in WarCabinet 372, Minute 1, were due to arrive on the previous night inthe neighbourhood of Albert. One Australian division had arrivedsouth of Arras, while three more British and one French division from the north were coming down. With regard to this questionof moving reserves promptly to the battlefield, it was pointed outhow fatal it would be if there were any hesitation on the part ofthe Prench in sending their divisions to support us.On this point, however, the Secretary was able to inform theCabinet that he had heard by telephone from Versailles that lord milner had seen General Petain and was quite satisfied that the^ French reserves were being pushed forward as fast as the railways^   could carry them.Future Operations. 3. Asked as to his views of the present situation and theprospects of the battle, Lord French said that he thought, from allthe information that he had examined, that there was a chance ofour being able to form an effective defensive line before we arrivedat a stage at which it might be necessary to retire our right flank inorder to protect the coast ports. In his opinion, it was too early tosay yet when a decision on this latter point should be taken, because we must first see what the result of our reinforcements would be ;but he held that the policy to be adopted in the contingency he had mentioned ought to be considered immediately. Supposing, forinstance, that the enemy should capture Amiens, or should separate the British Army from the French Army, he was of opinion thatthere was no real alternative for us except to cover the channel ports and hold the Cherbourg Peninsula at all costs. In such an event our main forces would not be severed (although the 5th Army,now under the French, might, have to retire with them), but theyy    would be separated from the French.4. The Director of Military Operations reported that the enemy&apos;sattacks had been renewed yesterday afternoon, when the Germansmade a heavy attack to the south of the Somme. They had capturedNesle and Guiscard. The French reserves had then arrived, andfrom the latest information it, appeared that the situation was nowin hand. At the same time the Germans had attacked north of the somme, and had. driven back our troops -to the line of the Ancre,namely, Albert-Miraument-Boyelles. The situation in this sectorwas the most dangerous, because the Germans have captured thegreater part of the Bazentin-Martinpuich plateau, except Montauban,which remained in our hands. Up to 10 a.m. this morning theenemy had not attacked, but it appeared likely that they mightrepeat to-day what they did yesterday. To sum up, General Mauricesaid that, although the situation was undoubtedly serious, it was stillfar from desperate. If our troops were forced back from the Ancreand a breach were made, the position might then become desperate.The PresentPosition. -
This, howeve , has not yet happened ; the line is still continuous1/ and intact, and the French reserves have scarcely been touched.The Italian Front:AustrianConcentration.5. The Director of Military Operations reported that there were no signs of any Austrian troops being moved to France from Italy,though some of their guns had beenwere some indications of an Austriany front.Assistance by united states forces in France.sent. He stated that thereconcentration on the Italian(). With reference to War Cabinet 372, Minute 8, the secretary reported that he had heard by telephone that Lord Milner had been unable to see General Pershing, but had arranged for GeneralRawlinson. to interview him instead. In the event of GeneralRawlinson being unable to obtain a satisfactory undertaking fromGeneral Pershing, Lord Milner proposed to return from Doullens tosee General Pershing on the subject.Telegram from 7. The Prime Minister read to the War (cabinet a telegramLord Reading. which he had received from Lord Reading, which stated that he was going to speak in New York and would  be glad to receive a. i^i^yi^y        steadying statement which would act as a stimulus for the obtaining//. of more men and ships.The Prime Minister undertook to send Lord Reading a messagein this sense-Immediate S. With reference to War Cabinet 372, Minute 2, Lord DerbyReinforcements and   reported that he had seen the Adjutant-General, who had informedtheir Transport.        him that arrangements were being made for the transport of at least-       ^fff20,000 men a day from the 29th instant until the source of supply* Ar*-*,is exhausted.Is    -    &apos;   PPossible Counter- 9- Phe question was raised of possible operations elsewhere toAttack. relieve the situation in the Somme area.   After some discussion, thecpiestion was postponed until after the return of the Chief of theImperial General Staff from his conferences in France, where thisy subject would certainly have been considered.Troops Available 1.0. The War Cabinet took note of a letter from the Field-for Home Service.     Marshal Commanding-in-Chief the Home Forces in regard to troops available for Home Defence (Paper G.T.-4030).Lord French said that, while he was in complete agreement that it was essential to send every available man to France, at thesame time he had felt bound to point out to the War Cabinet theeffect of their decisions on Home Defence.3.Ireland. 11. With reference to War Cabinet 372, Minute 13, the PrimeMinister informed the War Cabinet that he had invited Mr. Duke,&apos;7^^ry. gjr Bryan Mahon, and the Head of the Irish Constabulary to come0- to London the same day to discuss the question of applying theMilitary Service Act to Ireland.The view was expressed that there was much to be said forwaiting for the Report of the Convention before taking steps for theapplication of compulsory recruitment in Ireland. Mr. Gill, aNationalist, who was regarded as a good authority on the&quot; Irishquestion, was of opinion, the Prime Minister said, that conscriptionnow, without waiting-for the Report of the Convention, would leadto the most serious trouble.   This report could not be received
immediately, because no meetings of the Convention were being heldduring Holy Week, but there was reason to believe that when theReport was made it would be in favour of the War cabinet&apos;s letter(War Cabinet 351, Minute 12).Convoy attacked by Submarine.12. The First Sea Lord reported that the steamship &quot; Denbig -shire&apos;s&quot; convoy was attacked b3r a submarine 6 miles west ofHolyhead at 5 p.m. on the 24th instant. The submarine was hit bya shell from the steamship &quot; Austrian,&quot; and was believed to be sunk.No ship in the convoy was sunk.Bombing Baid onBruges.13. The First Sea Lord reported that a raid had been carriedout on Bruges during the night of the 23rd-24th instant. Four230-lb. and 48 112-lb. bombs were dropped.
