General Robertson had beenappointed lo the Eastern Command. Field-Marshal Sir Douglasiiaig had visited England and had been consulted in regard to the selection of an officer for the appointment of the British permanent military Representative at Versailles. It was hoped it would bepossible to announce this appointment very shortly.Mr. Bonar j Law further stated that the Prime Minister on theprevious day had rather inclined to the view that the Governmentshould make a statement in Parliament in regard to general robertson&apos;s resignation the same afternoon. Two draft statementshad been prepared, bat it had been found that, if everything was said that ought to be said, the statement became as long as a speech, and, on the contrary, if the statement was shortened it wasdefective. To. publish an incomplete statement would enableParliamentary opposition to discover the general lines of theGovernments case on this question, and to develop their attackaccordingly. Consequently, he had telephoned to the Prime Ministerto advise that no statement should be made to-day, aud the PrimeMinister, though not very willingly, had acquiesced.The War Cabinet agreed that No statement should  be made in  Parliament  till   thefollowing day.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,February is, 1918.
