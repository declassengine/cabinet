The first sea Lord read a telegram from the Rear-admiral commanding at Murmansk, which referred to the orders issued to intercept the ship &quot; Dora &quot; on her way to Murmansk. The tele-gram expressed the opinion that the ship should be allowed to pro-ceed, in order that her cargo, which was badly required by theRussians, might be used as an inducement to the authorities at archangel to give up the valuable British stores at that port,which at present they refused to do.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to his telegram No. 851 to Washington, which expressed the same opinion with regard to the &quot; Do that held by the  Rear-Admiral at Murmansk.The War Cabinet requested The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the First sea lord to arrange the matter between them.Explosion atRainham MunitionsFactory.5. The Secretary read out a statement received from theMinistry of Munitions regarding a fire and serious explosionwhich had occurred at Rainham T.N.T. Factory the previous evening. According to the information available, no lives hadbeen lost, the staff and labour being able to make their escape in good time. Representatives of the Explosives Department wereenquiring into the causes of the explosion, and would report indue course.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that theFool Position. French, Ambassador had expressed serious misgivings in regardto the British food supply, and doubted whether the British people would be content with the proposed scale of rations. The french had tried the plan of limiting prices, and it failed completely,with the result that another system had had to be adopted.M. Cambon stated that the reserves of French livestock had beendiminished by one-third since the beginning of the war, and hethought that if the British made a similar reduction the meatsupply, at any rate, would be assured for some time to come.Mr. Balfour urged strongly that the War Cabinet should fullyacquaint themselves with the facts of the food situation.
Allied NavalCouncil.In the absence of the Prime Minister and the Food controller the discussion was adjourned.8. The War Cabinet took note of the constitution and conclu-sions reached at the first meeting of the Allied Naval Council(Papers TO.-45 and I.C.-46).Husaia :Japanese Inter-vention.9. With reference to War Cabinet 330A, the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs informed the War Cabinet that he wasabout to circulate for their consideration a Memorandum dealingwith the whole question of Japanese intervention in Siberia.Death of Sir Cecil 10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the spring-Eiee. War Cabinet that Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, late Ambassador to theUnited States Government, had died suddenly of heart failure at ottawa the previous night.Publication ofMercantile losses from Submarines.Q11. With reference to War Cabinet 241, Minute 14, the WarCabinet had under consideration a Report by the Admiralty on theWorld Tonnage and Submarine and Mercantile Losses (paper g.T.-3572), in which it was suggested that a statement should belaid before Parliament indicating a comparison betweemthe losses sustained by the world&apos;s mercantile marine by the action of un-restrieted submarine warfare and the output of world shipping by our Allies and neutrals.The First Sea Lord stated that the Admiralty were exceedsingly anxious, in view of the low standard of output of ship-building that was being achieved, more especially at such a critical period, and that therefore, after very careful and prolonged con-si deration, the Board had decided to make the recommendation setout in their Paper, with a view to inducing the workers in the shipbuilding and related industries to make far greater effortsthan they had been doing in the past. The effect that such apublication wrould have in enemy countries had received mostmature consideration, and the Board realised that, on balance,more advantage might, be hoped to be obtained by publication inthe form recommended. The Admiralty had further been influ-experienced in this view by expert advice as to the very material effect the publication would have on the labour world.Mr. Barnes confirmed this view, and thought it most impor-tant that the statement should be issued, as his experience had shown that it was impossible, without figures, to bring home to theworkers the seriousness of the situation.Sir Auckland Geddes pointed out that in the near future,owing to absence of raw materials, the unemployment question would become acute, and that a clear statement as to the reasons which led to such a state of affairs would be of assistance in preventing labour troubles.Dr. Macnamara endorsed the view of the First Sea Lord, and recommended that, as the situation was changing from day to day,it was highly desirable that Sir Joseph Maclay should go throughthe document, with a view to putting forward any suggestions forits improvement. Dr. Macnamara also pointed out that the WarCabinet would probably find it necessary to obtain, the sanction of our Allies before publication took place. In the eventof the statement being put forward, he would suggestthat, after it had been presented as a Parliamentary&apos;Paper, it should be communicated , to the press, and thatcopies, together with a curve, should be sent to all the shipyards inthe country. He realised that subsequently a somewhat similar statement and chart would have to be published periodically, hut
the question of time would have to be further considered by theAdmiralty.The Minister of Shipping stated that he concurred with Dr.Macnamara, and was of opinion that the appeal should be made from the Admiralty, inasmuch as he thought such a course wouldhave most influence with the workers.The War Cabinet requested The Minister of Shipping, in conjunction with the Admiralty,to go over the statement, after which, subject to the PrimeMinister&apos;s approval, the Admiralty should communicate with our Allies, with a view to its publication.ElectricalWorkers :Possible Strike.12. The War Cahinet had under consideration a Memoran-dmn by the Commissioner of Police (Paper G.T.-3564), transmitted by the Secretary of State for Home Affairs, and a Memorandumby the First Commissioner of Works (Paper G.T.-3599) as to thepossibility of a strike on the&quot; part of the electrical trade unionworkers.Sir George Cave stated that the matter was brought to theWar Cabinet in view of the big question that would be involvedif men from the Army and Navy were utilised to carry on thegeneration of electricity for the requirements of London. he pointed out that if affected industries could not be kept as goingconcerns everything would be demoralised. For instance, themaintenance of refrigeration in cold storage would be affected;public lighting, the working of tramways, underground railways,and the supply of electrical power for all purposes would bebrought to a standstill.The Secretary of State for War and the First Sea Lord statedthat arrangements had been made to provide the necessary navaland military ratings that would be required pending volunteerworkers being forthcoming to take their places.The War Cabinet approved the proposal for naval and mili-tary ratings to be employed for the purpose in question, and alsoauthorised The FTrst Commissioner of Works to. arrange with theAdmiralty and War Office for such additional electricalworkers as might be required for his Department.The Commissioner of Police offered his assistance.Waste Products.13. With reference to a Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for War (Paper G.T.-3542) relative to &quot;the setting up of a central Council to deal with waste products of all sorts, the WarCabinet authorised the establishment of this Council.Lord Derby undertook to arrange with the Food Controlleras to the chairmanship of the Council.Export of PrintedMatter.14. The War Cabinet approved the Eeport of the Committeeon the Export of Printed Matter (Paper G.-191), and authorisedtne amendment of the Defence of the Realm Regulations 24 and24 (&amp;) as set out in the Appendix to the Report.Oat Rations forHorsies of theBritish Army.
lations of this and Allied countries. He stated that the effect of areduction of the oats ration from 10 lb. to 9 lb. would be equivalentto 14,000 tons of shipping a month, and mentioned that he under-stood that the British Army in France had 414,450 horses andmules, of which 66,118 were heavy horses.Lord Derby stated that he had very carefully gone into thequestion, and, if efficiency was to be maintained, he was of opinionthat it was quite impossible to reduce the ration below the rationauthorised (viz., 10 lb.) by War Cabinet 329, Minute 6, and addedthat he was taking steps to stop the import of any further horsesfrom the United States of America, except such as had alreadybeen purchased in that country.In view of the importance of effecting every possible saving in tonnage, however small, the War Cabinet requested Lord Curzon, assisted by such Departments or experts as he might desire, and after consultation with the Secretaryof State for War and the Minister of Shipping, to enquire into and decide as to the reduction of the oatsration for Army horses.The Secretary of State for War undertook to enquirefurther into the cutting down of the importation of horses, with a view, if possible, to the immediate cessation of shipments from the United States of America, and tocommunicate as requisite with the Minister of shipping on the subject,(Initialled) A.
