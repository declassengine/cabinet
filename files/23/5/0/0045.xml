With reference to the telegram discussed in War Cabinetsy*A^. 0^.^-1.     351, Minute 10, and particularly to Signor Orlando&apos;s statement&apos; &apos;    therein that there were signs of a great concentration of Austriantroops in the Trentino, the Director of Military Intelligenceremarked that, according to our information and Italian intelli-gence reports, this was only a local concentration.It was understood that the situation would receive due con-sideration by the Allied representatives at Versailles.Greece.Palestine.3. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that fiveclasses of reservists of the 2nd Division (Athens district) have beeny  called up to join the colours by the 7th March, 1918.y4. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that Araboperations were continuing, and that a pro-Sherif rising was expected shortly in the area between the Dead Sea and the HejazRailway. The railway had been damaged by mines between Maanand Tibuk. Scurvy had broken out at the latter place, and this,in addition to looting and pilfering along the line, was hamperingthe Turkish supplies. The Turkish Commander-in-Chief hadbeen inspecting the line of communications, and this had doubtlessgiven rise to the rumours that he had fled.Mesopotamia. 5. The Director  of  Military   Intelligence   reported   thatGeneral Marshall was advancing towards Hit, and had reachedKubba, a place 10 miles south of it.Lord Curzon recalled that some weeks ago he had urged theoccupation of Hit, on account of the oil wells, but that militaryobjections had been raised.General Macdonogh explained that the advance had been undertaken on the report, since proved erroneous, that the Turksy had evacuated Hit.   They probably had about 3,000 rifles there.The Balkan Front:Employment ofRussians behind the Line.3c/iff-y6. The Director of Military Intelligence reported thatGeneral Milne had been offered by General Guillaumat the servicesof Russian troops, to work behind his lines. They were ready towork, though not to fight. General Milne wished to know whether there were political objections to his accepting.The War Cabinet decided that There were no political objections.Bombing of OpenTowns.-,y1 y\oA7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that theSpanish Ambassador had given him a verbal message intimatingthat the King of Spain had been in communication with theGerman Government with a view to checking aerial attacks onopen towns.It was agreed that-The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should send a courteous reply, to the effect that we had always objected to the bombardment of open towns, and would like to knowy      what attitude the enemy adopted.
WC 35324Imperial WarCabinet,8. The Secretary of State for the Colonies reported that theDominion Premiers would arrive in the first week in June for they Imperial War Cabinet.Shortage of Paper.9. A suggestion was put forward that the vacant Chairman-ship of the Committee, appointed by War Cabinet 323, Minute 8,to deal with the distribution of paper, should be offered to Mr.Austen Chamberlain. It was pointed out, however, that a recent decision of the Committee on the Restriction of Imports (WarCabinet 347, Minute 5) affected the question.The Secretary was instructed to communicate with thePresident of the Board of Trade and ascertain his views onthe subject. In the event of Sir Albert Stanley&apos;s concurrence,he should invite Mr. Austen Chamberlain to become chair-man.Kussia: BolshevistRepresentatives inEngland.-510. With reference to War Cabinet 342, Minute 14, theSecretary of State for Home Affairs stated that, although thespeechesof M. Litvinoff had shown a quieter tone since the warn-ing had been given to him as a result of his proclamation inThe Woolwich Pioneer,&quot; his actions had been such as to neces-sitate the consideration of what measures should be taken by theGovernment to put a stop to his activities. It appeared that thereal name of M. Litvinoff was &quot; David Finkelstein &quot; and that hesubsequently adopted various aliases, notably &quot; Gustav GrafBuchman,&quot; &quot;Harrison,&quot; and more recently, :: Litvinoff.&quot; Therewas a possibility that evidence might be forthcoming connectinghim with the robbery at a bank at Tiflis some years ago. Thisrobbery was organised from Berlin. His most recent actions,which called for consideration, were: (a.) Attempts to undermine the discipline of Russian Jewsserving in the British and Canadian Forces.(fe.) The formation of an Information Bureau in the EastEnd of London for the dissemination of Bolshevik propaganda.(c.) The formation of Red Guards in London.The question of the attitude to be taken towards M. Litvinoffwas further complicated by the arrival at Aberdeen on Saturday,and subsequently in London, of three Bolsheviks, M. Kameneff,M. Saalkind, and a diplomatic courier. M. Kameneff was foundto be in possession of a cheque on an English Bank for 5,000Z.,which had been seized and was now deposited at Scotland Yard.The three agents had brought with them a good deal of baggage,some of which was personal and some under diplomatic seal. Itwas proposed that the personal baggage should be searched, andthat endeavours should be made to secure the opening of the sealedbags by M. Litvinoff in the presence of a Home Office representa-tive. - On the previous afternoon the police had raided theCommunist Club, in Soho, and found a meeting of Russianrevolutionaries taking place. One of the three new arrivals was present, but it was felt that he could not be arrested with thirty-seven other revolutionaries who bad been arrested. A carefulwatch was being maintained on the movements of the three envoys,and it was proposed that M. Saalkind, who had a passport forSwitzerland, should be hastened on his way thither. A certainnumber of papers had been seized at the Communist Club, includ-ing the Register of the Club, of which M. Litvinoff was a member,under the name of &quot;Harrison,&quot; subsequently changed in theregister to Litvinoff. As regards M. Kameneff, it was understoodthat he had intended to proceed to France, but now proposed to stay in England.
Tlie Home Secretary also proposed that an Order in council should be made under the Aliens Restriction Order, enabling a secretary of State to prohibit any alien from addressing meetingsor engaging in propaganda.Lord Harclinge stated that the visa given to M. Kanieneff &apos;spassport by Mr. Lindley in Petrograd, gave him the right to cometo England, and not merely to pass through England on his wayto France. However, the Government were within their rights in doing whatever they chose with him while in this country.The Director of Military Intelligence stated that the WarOffice were considerably perturbed by the attempts which werebeing made by Bolshevik agents to undermine discipline in theBritish Army, and hoped, that action, would be taken to put as top to such, proceedings. He understood that M. Litvinoff wasaccused not only of being connected with the bank robbery atTiflis, but also of forgery. A telegram had been sent to Tifliswith a view to obtaining further information upon this point.The Flonie Secretary stated that he had to answer a question on the subject of M. Litvinoff, put by General Page-Croft, in theHouse of Commons that afternoon.The War Cabinet decided that  &quot;(1.) The Home Secretary should give whatever informationhe thought  fit regarding M. Litvinoff &apos;s aliases, but should refrain from committing the Government to       0any particular course   of  action  in  regard to him,pending the receipt of further evidence against him.(2.) The Home Secretary should keep a careful watch overthe proceedings of the Bolshevist agents in London,and in the event of sufficient evidence of malpracticesbeing forthcoming, should at once take appropriate action against them, including deportation in case of necessity. No action, however, should be taken againstM. Litvinoff without the authority of the War Cabinet.y (3.) An Order in Council should be made as proposed.Return of British 11. The Director of Military Intelligence stated that he hadRepresentatives in received a telegram from our Military Attache in Petrograd-Russia- asking for instructions as  to &quot; leaving Petrograd with GeneralBarter and Staff. The War Office had replied, telling our military Attache to conform to the movements of Mr. Lindley.The Director of Military Intelligence added that the military attache thought that the best chance of getting away from russia would be via Murmansk, as the chances of getting through Finlandwere now small.Sir George Buchanan thought that the time had come whenit was desirable that our representatives should leave Russia.It would take them at least ten days to get away.. Lord Robert Cecil thought there was serious risk of theBritish Representatives at Petrograd falling into the hands ofthe Germans, who might very soon be in a position to send a bodyof troops to Petrograd. He thought that we could no longeradopt a policy of leaving it to the Englishmen on the spot todecide whether they should leave their posts, but that instructions should be given to them to withdraw as soon as possible.The Director of Military Intelligence stated that we shouldbe able to obtain information from a certain number of IntelligenceOfficers and Secret Agents who would remain in Russia after thewithdrawal of the Missions.It was pointed out, however, that if the Embassy staff andthe Military Mission were withdrawn, no means would remain.      for the transmission of cipher telegrams.
Japanese 12. With  reference to   War   Cabinet  350,   Minute 4,  the intervention. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that he had had^Isf1.-  an interview with the Japanese Ambassador on the 23rd February,3 1918.   The latter had informed him that the Japanese Govern-v&apos; rnent were anxious to proceed at once to seize the junction of theAmur Railway. This would safeguard Vladivostock. Mr.Balfour then questioned the Ambassador regarding the . furtherproposal that the Japanese should seize the whole of the siberian railway as far as the Urals, in order to deny the use of therailway and of Siberian produce to the Germans. The japanese ambassador fully understood the point, but had received noinstructions from his Government. Mr. Balfour then raised thequestion of mandate. He gathered that the Japanese fully understood that they would go in as the mandatory of the Allies,simply as a move against Germany, and would disavow anyintentions with regard to annexation. He gathered, however, thatthe Japanese were vehemently opposed to the addition of Allieddetachments to the Japanese force sent to effect these purposes,on the ground that Japanese public opinion would be suspicious,owing to the impression that was generally felt in Japan that,earlier in the war. the British had tried to curtail Japaneseactivities. The Japanese amour-propre had been deeply injured,and it would be most difficult to persuade the Japanese to acceptAllied co-operation other than that of Russians, such as GeneralSemenoff. This being the case, we should have a difficult task in persuading President Wilson to agree to our policy.It was pointed out to the War Cabinet that the FrenchGovernment only favoured Japanese intervention on the distinctunderstanding that the Japanese Government would agree to the major proposition of taking charge of the whole of the siberian railway.Lord Robert Cecil thought that we should ask the JapaneseGovernment to contemplate the seizure of the railway as far asCheliabinsk, the junction immediately east of the Urals. he gathered, from conversations with Englishmen and Russians whoknew Siberia, that Japanese intervention would not now produce a bad effect upon public opinion in Siberia.Sir George Buchanan agreed with this view, and thought thatthe situation in Russia as regards the Japanese had undergone aconsiderable change in the last few months. It should be clearlypointed out to the Russians that the Japanese were being brought* Mote by the Secretary.   It is understood that, in carrying&apos; out this decision, theForeign Office, will arrange that someone remains for the purpose of watching-developments and preserving cipher communication with this country.. (Int.) &apos;   M. P. A. H.[1365-353] CIn this connection it was pointed out that it was improbable that any large number of Englishmen would be able to get away from Russia in the present circumstances.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that thewhole point of our Representatives remaining in Petrograd wasthe chance that was thereby given of their influencing Bolshevikpolicy in our favour. The German peace terms accepted by theBolsheviks negatived this function.The War Cabinet requested, subject to the approval of thePrime Minister: -The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to send a telegram to Mr. Lindley, suggesting that he and the EmbassyStaff should return to this country as soon as possible,unless they saw any object in remaining longer: and,further, to send telegrams to Paris, Rome, and washington, informing our Representatives at those1/ places* of our- proposed action in this matter.
in to save Asiatic Russia from, being dominated entirely byGermany.Lord Milner took the view that in the near future russia would have a German-controlled Government at Petrograd, either under the Bolsheviks or a pro-German Czar. He attached little importance to the desirability of having small Allied detachmentsattached to the Japanese force. The great thing, in his view,was to remove the suspicion regarding our attitude which existed in the minds of the Japanese, We had steadily snubbed,the Japanese, and treated them as a convenience, and, looking to the future, he thought it was most essential that we should take such action as would remove this sense of grievance.The Director of Military Intelligence added that, as far ashe could gather from Japanese officers in this country, if wetrusted the Japanese we should get a great deal more out ofthem than we had hitherto.Mr. Long stated that he did not think the DominionGovernments would object to Japanese intervention, but in theevent of our communicating a decision of the Government favour-able to Japanese intervention to our Representative in washington, he would be glad if instructions were given to lord reading to inform and consult the Canadian Representatives atWashington in regard to the matter.Subject to the concurrence of the Prime Minister, the WarCabinet requested The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to send atelegram to Lord Reading, informing him that HisMajesty&apos;s Government viewed, with favour the idea of japanese intervention in Siberia up to Cheliabinsk,giving him the reasons which had led to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment arriving at this decision, and requesting himto obtain the concurrence of the American Government.A telegram to be sent to our representative at Tokio tellinghim for his confidential information of the action taken at Washington, and leaving it to his discretion to make such preliminary and tentative approaches to theJapanese to act, as he might think fit,ySinn-Fein Lawless- 13- With reference to War Cabinet 351, Minute 13, the Warness in Ireland. Cabinet had before them a telegram from the Chief Secretary tothe Lord Lieutenant (Paper G.T.-8720) regarding the seriouscharacter of the present state of unrest in some counties inIreland, in which he asked  ?-(1.) For a direction to the Army Council that removal orders under Defence of the Realm Regulation 14 shall bejf - made immediately in cases of individuals where theChief Secretary concurs with the General OfficerCommanding-in-Chief, Ireland, in the necessity7 for removal.(2.) That such orders shall be made effective in England bymeans of directions fixing the place of residence ofeach person.(3.) That directions shall be given to the Home Office for theissue of internment orders without delay in any cases in which internment may appear justifiable and necessary.The Secretary reported that, on receipt of a communication from the Irish Office on the previous day, he had already taken action with the Army Council in regard to (1), and that theArmy Council had empowered the General Officer CommandingIrish Command to take action under Regulation No. 14 of the
Defence of the Realm Act in such cases as may be sanctioned bythe Chief Secretary, and that the Chief Secretary had been so informed.The War Cabinet-(1.) Approved the action taken by the Secretary and theArmy Council.(2.) Instructed the Secretary to inform the Chief Secretaryfor Ireland that, in view of his telegram, they felt thenecessity for strong measures, and would support theChief Secretary in any action he thought necessary totake to enforce law and order.(3.) Instructed the Secretary to place himself in communica-tion with the Home Secretary in regard to the action by the Home Office, asked for by Mr. Duke.(initialled)   A. B.
