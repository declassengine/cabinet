Zeppelin Raids on great Britain.s-70.9. The attention of the War Cabinet was called to the recentescape of Zeppelins on two occasions when they had attacked theNorth-East Coast. There was an impression in the country thatthe Zeppelins had escaped owing to the supposed reduction of air squadrons in this country.The Secretary of State for War said that his impression wasthat the squadrons kept for defence in this country had not beenreduced, but he undertook to make enquiries on the subject fromthe Field-Marshal Commanding Home Forces, and to report to theWar Cabinet.Leakage ofInformation.3?&quot;V -10. With reference to War Cabinet 367, Minute 1, the Secre-tary reported that a further leakage of information had occurred in regard to the appointment of the Committee to deal with theproposed new Pensions Warrant (War Cabinet 367, Minute 21).In order to make quite certain that the leakage had not occurred in the offices of the War Cabinet, the Secretary had communicated with the editor of :&quot; The Times,&apos;&quot; who had informed him that on both the occasions referred to the information had been supplied in the Lobby of the House of Commons.TempeianeeAgitation in theUnited States ofAmerica.11. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported thatMr. Page, the United States Ambassador, had asked him to receive a deputation of American temperance reformers. The attitude ofa certain section of people in America was that no more grainought to be shipped from the United States to this country untilthe British Government prohibited brewing. Mr. Balfour saidthat he thought it would be better for the deputation to be receivedby the Prime Minister rather than by himself, and that it wouldbe well if Mr. Clynes could be present at the interview.The War Cabinet concurred in Mr. BalfouFs opinion, andinstructed -The Secretary to bring the matter to the Prime MinisteFsattention.Increase of KentBill.12. The War Cabinet had, under consideration a note by Air.Barnes, urging that the Increase of Rent Bill should be pressed on with (Paper G.T.-3913).The Secretary of State for Home Affairs informed the WarCabinet that this Bill had passed the House of Lords, and that either he or the President of the Local Government Board wouldtake charge of the Bill in the House of Commons, where he hopedthat it would be introduced and ordered to be printed to-morrow.He pointed out that the fact that the Bill was retrospective tothe date of its introduction would deter people from taking-action which would be rendered ineffective when it became law.Disposal of EussianGoods orderedagainst British,French, and american Credits.[1365-368]13. The War Cabinet had before them a note from Mr.Crosby to the Prime Minister (Paper G.T.-3887), and a letterfrom Sir E. Wyldbore Smith to the Secretary (Paper G.T.-3952),in regard to the disposal of Russian goods ordered against British,French, and American credits.Sir E Wyldbore Smith said that he was in favour ofreferring to the Versailles Council the question of the disposalof the residue of goods remaining after each creditor Governmenthad disposed of what it could. When everything possible hadbeen done by the creditor Governments, there would presumablystill remain a residue consisting of such goods as arms andammunition of Russian calibre, and manufactured articles ofRussian specification.   The use to which such stores might bestB 2
be applied should doubtless be decided, on grounds of military orother policy, by some central body of Inter-Allied authority, such,as the Versailles Council. To this end he proposed, if so directed,to have lists compiled of goods not required by the British orAllied Governments, which had been bought on British credits.The Secretary said that he had beard from Mr. austen chamberlain, who was unable to be present, to the effect that he agreed with the views of Sir E. Wyldbore Smith.The War Cabinet decided, subject to the agreement of theother Allies, that (a.) The proposals contained in  Sir E. Wyldbore Smith&apos;sletter (Paper G.T.-3952) should be adopted.(b.) The Secretary should reply to Air. Crosby notifying himy&apos; of this decision.Prisoners of War. 14. The War Cabinet had before them the following papersdealing with the responsibility for decisions with regard to prisoners of war: Memorandum by Lord Newton (Paper G.T.-3900),Memorandum by Sir G. Cave (Paper G.T.-3968),Memorandum by Lord Derby and Sir E. Geddes (paper g.T.-3973).&apos;Lord Robert Cecil stated that Departmental obstacles werefrequently encountered in connection with any fresh proposals fordealing with prisoners of war, and it might be desirable, when theless important matters of policy were involved, to leave them tosome small executive authority.The War Cabinet decided that In cases of Departmental disagreement concerning prisonersof war, not involving high matters of policy, lord curzon should act on behalf of the War Cabinet at therequest of any of the Departments interested.VL\ percent. Bonus:Position of theConciliation and arbitration Board.015. With reference to War Cabinet 317, Minute 1, the WarCabinet had before them a memorandum by Air. Barnes (paper g.T.-3966), dealing with the effect uponThe Conciliation and arbitration Board of the War CabineCs decision that all appli-cations for an increase in war advances, a,nd wages disputes arising therefrom, should be referred to the Ministry of Labour,who might refer them to the Committee on Production.Mr. Barnes said that the War Cabinet, when they reached this decision of the 7th January, had no intention of diminishingthe power of the Conciliation and Arbitration Board for Govern-nient employees. Claims from Government, employees for theper cent, bonus were at present being referred to the conciliation and Arbitration Board, and the Board wished to know whetherthey were prevented from dealing with them. He was of opinionthat, inasmuch as, when the 12$ per cent, was initiated, men onan upstanding wage were excluded from its operation, claimsmade by Government employees in receipt of an upstanding wageor salary should not be accepted by the Conciliation and Arbitra-tion Board.Sir William Collins said that the Board over which he pre-sided had been set up by the War Cabinet, and had beard from50 to 60 claims from Government servants. Two claimsinvolving the 12-1 per cent, bonus had recently come before them from clerks in the Royal Dockyards, and from writers in royal ordnance Factories. The exceptional aspect of these particularclaims was the fact that the award might affect the whole of theCivil Service.   The claim of the clerical employees in the Royal))
Dockyards for an increase of 12% per cent, on their present earn-ings arose out of instructions issued by the Admiralty that thetime-work earnings of workmen in the Royal Dockyards shouldbe increased by 12^ per cent. There was an over-riding minimum wage arrangement according to which increases to manual workers automatically affected the lowrest grade of clericalworkers in the dockyards. The Board would welcome informa-tion as to the grounds for the original grant of the \1\ per cent,increase, in order to be in a position to decide how far the same considerations were applicable to the claims now before them.The War Cabinet were agreed that their intention had been to refer manual workers to the Committee on Production. Therehad been no intention of referring Government employees engaged on clerical work to that Committee, or of extending the 12^ percent, bonus to clerical workers. Further, inasmuch as the Con-ciliation and Arbitration Board exercised quasi judicial func-tions, it was undesirable to restrict their Terms of Reference tomeet a particular case.The War Cabinet decided that &quot;   Minute 1 of War Cabinet 317, of the 7th January, 1918, wasnot to be read as in any way limiting the sphere of theConciliation and Arbitration Board as set forth in itsy Terms of Reference.Ireland: 16. With reference to War Cabinet 190, Minute 13, the atten-Weekly Eeports. tion of the War Cabinet was drawn to the fact that the weekly--&apos;.^v3r&apos;/. reports on the state of Ireland are not being furnished regularly.-x As the War Cabinet are very interested in the state of Ireland yy&quot;l, 3 The Secretary was Instructed to write to the Chief Secretaryfor Ireland on the subject.League of Nations. 17. Mr. Barnes drew the attention of the War Cabinet to the debate which took place in the House of Lords on the previous day on the subject of the League of Nations, and expressed thehope that Lord Curzon. in his reply, would, on behalf of theGovernment, strongly support the proposal. He alluded to the strong views on this subject held by the Labour Party, which he himself shared.Lord Curzon said that the debate on this question had been adjourned until after the recess, and stated that he had no inten-tion of being condemnatory in his reply, being anxious to accept,the principles involved, but that it would be desirable to pointout that the formation of any League of Nations was hardly possible during; hostilities, and that the application of such apolicy must depend on the issues of the war.At Lord Curzon&apos;s invitation Mr. Barnes undertook to  forward Lord Curzon a memo-y randum on the subject.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8&apos;.
