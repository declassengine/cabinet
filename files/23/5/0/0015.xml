Stefania. 1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that hehad received a telegram from General Berthelot, which stated that aGerman General from Siberia had arrived at Kieff, and was taking steps to organise a force, composed of Austrian prisoners. GeneralBerthelot had protested against this. The telegram also statedthat there was little fear of enemy offensive action on the,.&apos; Roumanian front.The Italian Front.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theItalians captured 250 prisoners on the 14th instant, and had succeeded in occupying a summit in the vicinity of Mount Asolone,but, owing to heavy shell-fire, it had subsequently had to be evacuated.Co-operation of theUnited States ofAmerica.c2o7o o.,y2. Is T.3. With reference to War Cabinet 321, Minute 9, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff read a telegram from General Pershing(Paper G.T.-3349) (Appendix), which stated that General Pershinghad recommended to his Government that the proposal that Americanbattalions should be incorporated in British divisions should be givenserious consideration, and, if adopted, carried out under certain conditions. The telegram concluded with a request for information to be supplied to the United States Government regarding thestrength of the British armies, and a statement setting out theresources of the man-power of the British Empire.The War Cabinet authorised The Chief of the Imperial General Staff to send a telegramcommunicating this information to General Pershing,pointing out that the total of our armed force amounted tono less than 1 in 8, or 1 in 9, of the population.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff was instructed to include in his figures the number of men in the Navy; to make a reference to our efforts in regard to the additionalburdens imposed upon us by maintaining nearly the wholeof the maritime transport of our European Allies ; and alsoto draw attention to the great industrial effort &quot;which wasbeing made by Great Britain.Portion of FrenchLine taken over by american Troops.3.Supply of AmericanAeroplanes.3.4. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinetthat an American division was about to take over a portion of theFrench line on the Western front, on the front of a brigade.5. With reference to War Cabinet 320, Minute 9, attention was again called to the slow progress being made in the development ofthe United States of America aerial programme. It was stated thatthe &quot; bottle-neck &quot; of the United States programme was likely to bein regard to the assemblyejjthe parts into complete machines onthis side. The number of United States of America mechanics whohad been sent over to England was not large, and it was stated thatthere was some risk of blame being attached to us for any failure inthis respect.In tins connection Mr. Barnes, as an engineer, pointed out thatit would be impossible to assemble the machines properly unless thesame men who had made them in the United States were availablefor the purpose.The following figures were quoted in regard to the British andFrench aerial output compared with that of the enemy : German aeroplanes on the Western front ...    4,500British and French aeroplanes on the western front     ... ... .^ ... ...   4,700
In view of the slow rate of progress in the completion of theAmerican programme, these figures were not regarded as providing a sufficient margin of safety.The War Cabinet decided To hold a Special Meeting in the near future to consider thewhole position in regard to aerial output.G. The First Sea Lord read a telegram received from theCommander-in-Chief, China, which stated that a bottle had beenfound in the sea, containing two papers which gave information regarding a German raider which was on her way last August tomine a number of British harbours in the Pacific. The secondpaper gave a description of the raider.The First Sea Lord stated, in answer to a question, that he hadno information regarding the German raider, but that there hadbeen tune for her to return to a German port.7. With reference to War Cabinet 316, Minute 2, theFirst Sea Lord stated that he had received a telegram fromHALS. &quot; Suffolk,&quot; now at Vladivostock, which stated that thegeneral situation there was peaceful, but that Bolshevik influencewas very strong amongst the garrison, fleet, and workmen. the suspicion aroused by the arrival of a Japanese warship had beendispelled by the arrival of the &quot; Suffolk.&quot; The telegram concludedIvy saying that the garrison and navy were in a state of anarchy,and that officers had been reduced to the ranks, in accordance withM. Leniifs decree.8. With reference to War Cabinet 109, Minute 8, the WarCabinet had before them a Memorandum by Sir Edward Carson(Paper G.T.-33 L1) calling attention to the reduction in the importsof paper and the consequent cutting down of the supply tonewspapers which will be necessary. He had conferred with theDepartment of Information, which issued many publications abroad,and with the Newspaper Proprietors&apos; Association. There was general agreement that large economies could be made hy stoppingunnecessary publications, by preventing waste, especially in Govern-ment Departments, by using an inferior quality of paper and smallertype, and by a more energetic collection of waste. He recommendedthat a small Committee should be appointed, under an independent chairman, to examine the demands of Government Departments andthe possibility of establishing a system of priority in distribution.Sir Thomas Whittaker, a former Chairman of the Paper Corn-mission, was of opinion that the Government Departments wereguilty of much waste, especially those which issued Departmentaljournals. There should also, he thought, be a severe reduction in thenumber of Parliamentary papers issued. The Paper Commission hadaccumulated much valuable experience, and it might serve as an advisory body to a Chairman or Controller able to give his whole time to the task.Sir Rowland Bailey, in the absence, through illness, of sir henry Birchenough, the Chairman of the Paper Commission, agreedthat more drastic action was essential. Sir George ToulmuTs Com-mittee in the House of Commons had done useful work in various ways, but it had not taken upon itself to decide whether a particularpublication was or was not necessary. Much had been done by thePaper Commission by going into the provinces and organisingcampaigns against waste. Sir Henry Birchenough had prevailed on important trades, like the soap trade and the tobacco trade, to make substantial savings.
Mr. Churchill said that he had been in communication withrepresentatives of the Newspaper Proprietors&apos; Association, with aview to strengthening the organisation for the collection of waste.Pie bad been pressed to extend the machinery under the control ofthe Ministry of Munitions, and he was, in fact, preparing amemorandum on the subject for the War Cabinet. He did not wishto duplicate existing machinery if the work was already being donewell. It was most desirable in his view to support to the utmostthe supply of paper to the newspapers, as they were indispensable toto the maintenance of public spirit during the war.The War Cabinet decided -To appoint a Committee, consisting of -Sir Edward Carson (Chairman),Mr. Churchill,Sir Albert Stanley,Mr. Hayes Fisher,Sir F. Atterbury,Sir PI. Birchenough,Sir Thomas Whittaker,Sir Rowland Bailev,to review the whole question, Sir Edward Carson to beauthorised to take decisions on behalf of the War Cabinet^ at his discretion.States.Priority of Finance 9. With reference to War Cabinet 297, Minute 1, the Warin the United Cabinet bad before them a memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (Paper G.T.-3292) dealing with the question of financial-j^^x      priority for the Food Controllers programme.r/C.   ./ Lord Bhondda said he was prejwed to accept the interpretation^-        y        of the War Cabinet&apos;s decision as set forth by Mr. Bonar Law in his memorandum.Mr. Churchill said that a position had been reached when a choice bad to be made between importing one commodity rather than another, although both were in a high degree necessary for the prosecution of the war. The decision must rest with the WarCabinet. He was bound to point out that the munitions position was very serious. In 1918 the Germans would become more powerful than we were in artillery. A series of decisions had beentaken by the War Cabinet prejudicial to the supply of fighting-material. There bad been a cut of 500,000 tons of steel. We werenot getting more than two-thirds of the ore programme from Spain.In America we were held up by want of dollars.    Nevertheless, ^cotton was still being imported, and on a higher scale in 1918 than &apos;)in 1917. The cumulative effect would be to make a great military effort impossible. His Council were alarmed at the absence of anydefinition of limits within which the purchases of the Food Controllerwere to be exercised. In the past we had given 40,000 tons a monthof shell steel to France, and were continuing this for the month ofJanuary, but it would be now necessary to refer the French to theUnited States. The French had nearly exhausted their supply ofnitrates. The Italians had exhausted their stock. Our reserve of350.000 tons bad been brought down to 100,000 tons, which wasvery low in view of the long voyrages entailed. If the United StatesGovernment were going to fail us in the air and with men, the leasttheyr could do was to provide us with dollars, so as to furnishmunitions for our fighting forces.Mr. Austen Chamberlain said that he found himself in theposition of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in relation to the spending Departments. Each demand presented separately tothe American Board could be justified by substantial arguments,which, if regarded alone, were unanswerable. Inasmuch as all thedemands could not be met, the American Board required instructions from the War Cabinet as to the order of priority and the quantity
to be allowed at a given time.   At the end of December we had jDtitforward our  requirements for dollar credits on the basis of the reduced demands of the Departments.    To finance all the demandsmaturing in  January would have   required   275,000,000 dollars.Owing to delay in effecting purchases and to other causes, he thoughtit would be possible to get through on 235,000,000 dollars, but atthe moment we were only being offered credit for 180,000,000 dollars.Further, inasmuch as, owing to deiay in purchasing, &amp;c, we had not obtained the commodities expected, our needs in February and the ensuing months would be correspondingly greater.   Mr.  Crosbie,who was acting for the United States Government, confronted withour demands, replied that if they were met he would have little or nothing left for the other Allies, and he was pressing that a consideredprogramme should be put forward by the three Western Allies,together with the   United States.   Mr.  Crosbie was under theimpression that by such a co-ordination a great deal of waste couldbe eliminated, and the joint demands reduced.  He (Mr! Chamberlain)agreed with Mr. Crosbie.    By such machinery the Americans wouldlearn how much was being done for the French.    We ought not toprovide materials for France without obtaining compensation inmaterial or dollars from the United States.    We had, perhaps, donetoo much for France, as was illustrated by her willingness to surrender 700,000 tons for munitions, from the tonnage of 2.000,00 -assigned for food.   Would it not be possible to set up at Versailles,for example, a Military Supply Commission, on which the americans would be represented, to draw up the most urgent needs for a commoncampaign ?   If this were done, Mr. Crosbie would probably honourits demands, as he did those of the Wheat Commission.Mr. Churchill urged that it was very difficult to apply a satis-factory standard to military requirements. The greater the munitionsavailable, the greater and more frequent were the attacks that couldbe made upon the enemy. With food it was different; because aminimum standard of subsistence could be laid down.It was pointed out, on the other hand, that some agreement asto military needs for a particular campaign was practicable. &quot;when these needs were defined, they could then be examined in the lightof the available tonnage, and correspondingly reduced in the order of urgency. When that stage had been reached, with the co-operationof the experts of the United States, it would be possible to convince them that the dollars were absolutely indispensable if the campaignwas to be carried out. It was better, therefore, to begin from the side of military needs than from the side of dollars.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that, on the whole,the best policy was to continue the arrangements now in existence,that is, to go on ordering the goods which we deemed to be absoulutely essential, partly on account of the fact that orders oftendid not take immediate effect and consequently had not to be paid for at the anticipate:! dates, and partly trusting to our being able to convince the United States that they ought to find the money as analternative to breaking the exchange.The War Cabinet decided To instruct the Chairman of the American Board as follows : (1.) Purchases by the Food Controller of the essential minimumsupply of foodstuffs in the United States shall have priority of allocation from the available credits ;(2.) No new commitments shall be entered into in the UnitedStates by other Departments, unless they are small in amount and in the judgment of the Chairman of theBoard of quite exceptional urgency, until the aggregate of requirements has been brought within the figure ofthe credits which it is expected to receive from theUnited States Treasury after allowing for exchange;.323] C
(3.) The Board shall consider with the  Army Council thepossibility   of   suspending   the   further   purchases  ofremounts for a period of three months;(4.) The Board shall consider with the Army Council and theMinistry of Munitions the suspension of further purchases of mechanical transport in the United States;(5.) The Board shall consider with the Ministry of Munitionsthe possibility of the cancellation or postponement of delivery uucler existing- contracts ;(6.) These instructions may be confidentially communicated bythe Chairman of the Board to the representative of theUnited States Treasury.Steel for Trance. 10. The War Cabinet authorised The Minister of Munitions to explain to M. Loucheur our inability to continue the supply of steel to France on thesame scale as hitherto.Accommodation forInter-allied council.11. The War Cabinet instructed The Secretary to represent to the First Commissioner of works the urgent importance of providing suitable office aceom-,y &apos; modation for the Inter-Allied Council.Maternity and child Welfare.12. The War Cabinet had before them the following documentsdealing with maternity and child welfare: Memoranda by Dr. Addison (Papers G.T.-2458 and 3350).Memoranda by Sir E. Cornwall (Papers G.T.-2460 and 3348).Memorandum by Mr. Long (Paper G.T.-2527).Memoranda by&quot; Mr. Hayes Fisher (Papers G.T.-2372, 2514,and 3332).Mr. Hayes Fisher said, he was anxious to have the permission of the War Cabinet to introduce the Maternity and Child WelfareBill, which he had prepared, in order to give to the local authoritiesin England and Wales powers which were already enjoj^ed in Scotlandand Ireland. An important deputation from these local authoritiesbad waited upon him quite recently, asking for powers to enablethem to give milk to expectant mothers, to provide lying-in homes,and similar agencies. The Bill was a small one, and would easilypass through the House of Commons. It was not a rival to anyattempt to co-ordinate the health services of the country under oneCabinet Minister.Dr. Addison objected to the Bill as at present drafted because it extended new powers to hundreds of Rural District and smallUrban District Councils, who could not possibly provide the agenciesrequired nor the expert services to run them. The Bill would createfresh vested interests, which it would be difficult to remove when an attempt was made later on to secure a larger unit of healthadministration. The Bill, if proceeded with, should be amended soas to make the local authorities, for the purposes of the Act, at least as large as the authorities under the Education Act of 1902.Further, provision should be made for the co-option of persons,other than members of local authorities, with special experience,including, for example, members of Insurance Committees. Thirdly,before any scheme was put into operation the prior approval of theCentral Authority should be secured. He did not agree withMr. Llayes Fisher that the Bill would not be vigorously opposed inthe Plouse of Commons.    The representatives of the Insurance
Man-Power: 13. With reference to the Government proposals dealing withPosition of the military service and man-power,  as set forth by Sir AucklandAmalgamated Geddes in the Flouse of Commons on the 14th January, the PrimeEn^&apos;ineors Minister read telegrams which had been received from the repre-G       sentatives of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers asking that adeputation should be received to discuss the arrangements come to with the Government on the 5th May, 1917.The War Cabinet decided To refer the matter to Mr. Barnes and Sir Auckland Geddes to frame a suitable reply, and to decide whether and by whomthe deputation should be received.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,January 16, 1918.Committees would press for representation on the administering authority, particularly as they were now dealing with domiciliarymedical attendance.Sir Edwin Cornwall believed that the Approved Societies wouldnot support the Bill in its present shape. They were stronglyinterested in the provisions of maternity benefit. Any encroachmenton their sphere of influence would arouse opposition, but it might bepossible to come to terms with them.Lord Bhondda was in favour of the Bill, provided that itwas clearly understood that it would not prejudice the prospects ofestablishing a Ministry of Health. He believed, however, that thepresent Bill, as now framed, would be strongly opposed by the approved Societies.The War Cabinet decided -To refer the Maternity and Child Welfare Bill to the following-Committee : Mr. Hayes Fisher (Chairman),Dr. Addison,Lord Rhondda,Mr. H. A. L. Fisher,Mr. Walter Long,Sir Edward Cornwall,( for consideration and report.
APPENDIX.(G.T.-3349.) ___(Secret.)01/135/388.Secretary, War Cabinet.WITH reference to my memorandum, numbered as above, dated 12th instant, tothe War Cabinet, regarding American battalions for British divisions, I now forward acopy of a telegram which I have received from General J. J. Pershing, commandingAmerican army in France, in reply to a paper I addressed to him on the 10th instantfrom Paris.   I attach a copy of my paper of the 10th January for information.(Signed) W. II. ROBERTSON, C.I.G.S.War Office, January 15, 1918.(Translation.)(Confidential.)January 14.General Sir William Robertson, Chief of Staff, British Army.f. With reference to our conference in Paris, I have forwarded hy cable to washington the substance of your memorandum of 1 0th January.My cable suggested that your request for battalions of infantry for service with british army, three battalions for each of fifty divisions, be given serious consideration,and, if adopted, that following points be carried, out. First, that the plans be regardedas a temporary measure to meet a probable emergency. Second, that as soon aspracticable the remaining troops of our divisions thus temporarily disorganised bebrought over and the divisions be reorganised for service with our own army. Third,that the division, brigade, and regimental commanders and their staffs of such infantrybe sent over for training with corresponding British units. Fourth, that the infantrybe taken from those divisions that could not otherwise be transported until after June.Fifth, that only such battalions or other units be attached to British Army as couldbe provided with sea transportation by the British Government. Sixth, that the transportation of such battalions should in no way interfere with the present plans and means of transporting American Army to France. Seventh, that above propositioncontrollable entirely apart and separate from any plans for sending over our own forcesin our own slaps through Brest, Southampton, or otherwise. Eighth, that battalionsloaned to British are to be returned to the American Army when called for, probablywhen the remaining troops of the divisions to which they pertain are brought over.2. Information has been received from Washington that two ships, the&quot; Mauritania &quot; and the &quot; Aquitania,&quot; have been mentioned as available for transportingthese extra troops. It is my understanding also that we may still take advantage of theoffer made by the Commander-in-Chief, British Army, regarding areas of training for american troops and their supply by British Army during periods of training and so forth as presented in the memorandum by General Butler.3. In view of the national sentiment in our country against service under an Alliedflag at this time, it is deemed of the utmost importance, if the above plan is to be consideredby our Government, that the British Government state its purpose to exert every energyto keep its own forces as strong in man-power as possible. Only with this general understanding in America would the foregoing plans meet with approval there. I havecabled the substance of this view to Washington, and would request a full statementfrom you as to British resources in this regard, including; those at present available andto become available during this year. This information is desired in order that our government may have all the facts before making a final decision on the important question now under advisement. Pershing.
(Secret.)c.i.g.s.O. 1/135/888.General J. J. Pershing,Commanding American Army in France.In accordance with your wishes, I forward this memorandum explanatory of therequest of the British Government that you will consider the question of supplyingsome American battalions for temporary employment with British infantry brigades.We have verbally discussed the matter at some length during the last two days, and as you are aware the present request is the same as that made to Colonel House byMr. Lloyd George on the 2nd December last, except that it now refers to battalionsonly and not, as previously, to companies or battalions.It is obvious that Germany may be expected to strive her utmost, if not to winoutright, to place herself at any rate in a winning position during the next seven oreight months. PXussia&apos;s defection enables her greatly to strengthen her forces on theWest or Italian front, or on both, and for the last three months German divisions havebeen coming over as quickly as they can be transported. Italy is still weak and willprobably continue to require British and French assistance. The man-power of Franceis rapidly diminishing. The British divisions are being reduced from 12 to 9 battalionsbecause of the shortage of men, and it will be. difficult for us to maintain at strengtheven the 9-battalion division throughout the year. There are already 28 more german divisions on the West front than a year ago; there are 11 fewer British and french divisions (gone to Italy), making a net gain to Germany of 39 divisions ; she can easilybring over 40 more divisions by May, as well as a large number of heavy guns, and, asshown above, the British divisions will in future have 25 per cent, less infantry in them than in 1917. The situation is therefore becoming very serious, and it is with con-siderable anxiety that the British and French authorities look forward to the summer,because, even if we hold up the German attack, as we hope to do, our divisions may become so attenuated and exhausted in the process as to be lit for little employmentafterwards. In other words, if France and England do not receive substantial american military assistance before the summer, the assistance America is now preparing may come too late to admit of the Entente securing the kind of peace for which they are fighting:.I understand that you cannot give any definite opinion regarding the amount ofyour assistance owing to the uncertainty as to shipping and other things, but that the arrival of 15 divisions b\r the end of June is the most you hope for; while, of course,several of these divisions will not be ready to fight for some months later. In view of probable developments, this forecast is. in my opinion, much too small to ensure thehostile attack being adequately met. For this reason the British Government earnestlyhope that serious consideration will be given by you to their request for help.The main difficulty in making your help available lies in sea-transport, and fromthis point of view it is clear that to bring from America a giveu number of men withall necessary equipment, horses, &amp;c., as complete divisions means an infinitely greatershipping effort than to bring the same number of men as battalions, and withouttransport of any kind which could be found by us. Having regard to the generalcritical situation and to the shortage of our man-power, my Government is prepared inorder to secure infantry reinforcements immediately ,to run very considerable risks inthe reduction of our present stocks of food and war material, in the hope that later onthe American commercial fleet as it gradually increases may be able to give compensationfor cargo shut out by the carriage of the reinforcements. All could be done &quot;withoutin any way interfering now or in the future with the transport for the american army as at present arranged, and it is estimated that 150,000 additional men (or150 battalions) could be brought over within three or four months of the time it is decided to permit of their employment in the manner indicated. Whether the battalions would be brought to England or to France for training, is a matter, with several others, which can be settled later. They would in any case be trained underyour officers, of course. After being used by battalions in brigades for a sufficient time to become efficient they could, if you so desired, be used as brigades in british divisions under their own Brigadiers; and later on, if and when required by you, thebrigades could be recalled from the British divisions and go to form American divisions.Everything possible would be done to meet your wishes in this and all other respects,although you will, I am sure, understand that it would not serve any verv useful
purpose to put these American units into British formations unless they could remainthere for a reasonable period of time say four or five months.The great difficulty which confronts yott in acceding to the above request is thevery natural one of national sentiment, and the desire to retain national identity. Thisis fully appreciated by the British Government, who feel that if America can acceptthe proposttl she will thereby display the greatest possible magnanimity and sacrifice.It is, however, a matter of national sentiment on the one hand, and, on the other, ofGermany establishing herself in a winning position if your assistance does not arrive intime.I understand that you have some 45 divisions in course of formation, and that tofind the battalions I have ventured to suggest you would have to break into these divisions. But it is practically certain that at least 15 of the 45 cannot reach Francethis year, and therefore they will be idle till 1919 if the war lasts as long. Further,I may say that we, when raising our new Armies, were compelled to break up two ofthese Armies in order to send the battalions as such to France. Had we not done sowe could not have held our own in 1915.You have made two alternative suggestions : (a.) For us to bring over divisions in place of battalions.(6.) To withdrawn all our infantry from a certain number of divisions and replace them with your battalions.I have already dealt with (a) in discussing transport, and the two or three extradivisions which the available tonnage would bring would not, I feel sure, be deemed by my Government sufficient justification for the risks incurred in providing the tonnage.With respect to (6), the effect would be still to leave the divisions partly american and partly British; the change would involve the divisions being out of action forseveral weeks; and it would have to be made probably at the most critical period ofthe year. In fact, I do not think it would be possible to attempt making it at thetime.I trust that the above explanation makes everything clear, and I am sure that inthe general interest you will give it careful attention. As you are aware, the french prime Minister feels equally with the British Government the inestimable value of theproposal, and has no desire whatever to raise difficulties in regard to its application tothe French Army as well as to the British Army. His only wish is that you should do all you can to help either the French or the British.(Signed) W. R. ROBERTSON, General, G.I.G.S.Paris, January 10, 1918.
