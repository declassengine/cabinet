German concentration on the front Arras-Peronue. There were some signs of the possibility of an early attack.The Italian Front. With reference to War Cabinet 356, Minute 2, some indica-/ X 7    ^ons were brought before the War Cabinet of the possible transferChf// &apos; &apos; 0f the attack fi -om the Western front to the Italian front,, owing tothe repercussion on German public opinion of a possible failure.w.^3-f. General Smuts recounted a conversation which he had had with3 Baron Sonnino in Rome, during which the latter had expressedstrong dissatisfaction with the forthcoming removal of two british divisions from Italy. Baron Sonnino was of opinion that Italy couldbe kept in the war to the end, but that this removal of british divisions was not the way to help her to do so ; if any troops wereto go, they should be French rather than British, because the Britishwere so popular, and had had so good an effect on the Italian moral.Baron Sonnino had said that Austrian divisions were pouring in onthe Italian front, and that, while he was not actually apprehensive of disaster, he could not help being anxious to some extent. Badinfluences were at work in Italy, and among them the shortage ofcoal had played its part. While it was true that German divisions had gone away, peace with the Ukraine had, on the other hand,released numbers of Austrian troops. Baron Sonnino said that if abig attack came and the Italians failed, they would say that we haddeserted them, and the blame would be put upon us.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, with reference to the alleged pouring in of Austrian troops, pointed out that, while theItalians asserted that eight or nine Austrian divisions had arrived inthe Trentino, the British and French intelligence reports onlymentioned two additional Austrian divisions on that front. Theserumours and apprehensions always came from Rome, and not fromGeneral Diaz. General Wilson said that, in his opinion, while itwas quite possible that the Germans might attack Italy, the attackcould not come until the snow melted, although there was less snowthis year than usual.With reference to the removal of British divisions from Italy,General Wilson had approached General Foch on the subject, andGeneral Foch had admitted that the initiative came from him, andthis was because the Executive Committee at Versailles had not yetgot into working order, and that the Italians had not been consultedeither through Versailles or direct. One of the two British divisionswas starting to-day, and the second would follow later. It wouldtake about teii days to move a division at the rate of sixteen trainsr?c, a day.//v/- The War Cabinet were reminded that in the discussion oir&quot;   /; \x/\ General   l\ash&apos;s   Report   on   Transportation   (War Cabinet 355,./*&apos;..- Minute 9, and War ( cabinet 356, Minute 9), it had been pointed outthat any troop movement limited the amount of coal that could be transported, and that that was a factor which ought to be considered., As to the Allied General Reserve (War Cabinet 349, Minute 7),($rf/tt^i?/^/^&apos;      it was pointed out that the contributions would be as follows : Divisions.Italian ... ... ... ...      6French (8 from France and 4 from Italy) ... 12British       . ... ... ... ...       2Total    ... ... ...      20The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Chief of the Imperial. General Staff should refer thefollowing questions to the Executive Committee at versailles for the Control of the Reserves : 
WC 357Tho.OSEeview of theMilitary Situation.Z.3.Persia.(1.) The question of whether the second british division should he moved from the italian front.(2.) The question of whether, and, if so, how many,Italian divisions should be brought.(6.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should informthe Italian Government of this decision.4. With reference to War Cabinet 356, Minute 5, the PrimeMinister drew the attention of the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff to the decision of the War Cabinet on the previous day,requesting the General Staff to give a general review of the wholemilitary situation, including the question of the development of thesupply of Tanks.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook to furnishthis report as soon as certain decisions in policy had beentaken.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that thePersian Committee had many important matters to consider the same evening, which might influence the decisions as to military policy inPalestine and Mesopotamia.Capture of german merchant-ship.6. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported the capture, on 22ndFebruary, off the coast of Norway, of the German steamship&quot; dusseldorf,&quot; unarmed, with a cargo of iron ore. A prize crewhad been placed on board, and the ship ordered to sail for Lerwick.Vladivostock. 7. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported a message from H.M.S.;&apos; Suffolk,&quot; to the effect that the Ussuri Cossacks required supportindependently of Semenov, with whom they were not in contact.They could not make a start until they were supported financiallyand materially. They could probably be induced to accept assist-ance from the Japanese if assured that The Japanese Governmentwere acting in accord with other Allied Governments, and were notactuated by selfish motives. If financial assistance were delayed, itwas feared that they would come under Bolshevik influence,their economic wants being of extreme urgency. The first step should be the supply of grain and arms to Harbin, whence theCossacks would be able to take them by their own means secretly toIman. They would then be in a position to take possession of therailway, and Vladivostock would be at their mercy. These move-ments would be preliminary to an advance through Siberia in concert with other Cossack forces. The Cossauk leaders were atpresent of opinion that the assistance of Allied forces would then become necessary. The object the Cossack leaders had in view wasthe formation of an independent State east of Baikal, under Alliedprotection.Egyptian cotton crop.8. The War Cabinet had before them the Report of theEconomic Offensive Committee containing a proposed scheme ofState requisition of Egyptian cotton crops (Paper G.-198).The War Cabinet approved the scheme.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March 1, 1918.
