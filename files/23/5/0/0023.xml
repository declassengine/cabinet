The Hedjaz. 1. THE Director of Military Operations reported a successfulArab raid near Medina, ending in the capture of a small Turkish\S convoy.a omea. 2. The Director of Military Operations read a passage from a.   \ 0*/V&quot;   Z,       report by General Guillaumat concerning the present condition of&quot; y&amp;j &apos;      the French forces on the Salonica front.    They were, according tothis report, short of supplies, and the troops were suffering fromhunger. These conditions did not apply to the Italian and Britishtroops. This state of affairs was serious, and would lead to publiccomplaint in France before long.General Maurice stated that, according to figures checked at versailles, the French trooj)s on the Salonica front were 28,000 menbelow strength.    Drafts amounting to 20,000 men were, however,y being despatched.American Military 3. With reference to War Cabinet 328, Minute 3, the DirectorCo-operation. of Military Operations read extracts from a French report concerningOf//3 &quot;f/&apos;&apos; yb ^e s^ate 0^ the American Army.    It was expected that there would^7/&apos;     / ^ be 8 divisions in France in March, 14 in June, and 20 in September1918, and 28 in January 1919, but these divisions would require sixmonths&apos; training in France before they would be fit to take an active part in operations. Hence, by July only 4 trained divisionscould be counted on, and by October only 8, with perhaps 4 half-trained divisions fit for a quiet sector. At the present moment therewas one efficient division, and a second was now about to receive its first trench training.It was asked whether these figures were independent of the150,000 lately promised.   The answer was in the affirmative.It was also asked whether these 150,000 men would be as slow to become efficient as the divisions referred to in the French report.The Director of Military Operations pointed out that battalionscould be trained in one-sixth of the time required for the training ofa division. If the transport of these troops began at once, we shouldhave some of these battalions in the line in May.The Secretary of State for War expressed a fear that thetonnage available for the transport of these troops was going to be cut down. He also adverted to the very backward state of thetraining of the American infantry.Supreme War 4. With reference to War Cabinet 329, Minute 13, the DirectorCouncif: of Military Operations read a telegram from the Chief of theoin 0 e o. 10. Imperial Genera! Staff, and suggested that the Prime Minister should see Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Plaig- before discussing at Versaillesthe extension of the British front.The War Cabinet instructed instructed The Director of Military Operations to inform Field-marshal sir Douglas Haig that the Prime Minister would see him at versailles on Tuesday next, 29th January, 1918.The Director   of  Military  Operations pointed out that theO-s/f^,y/   ^      decision to be taken now concerning the extension of the British&apos; /     / front should not be affected by the expectation of American reinforce-ments, as there could not be enough Americans in line to modify thesituation seriously before June.
3WG 331Joint Note No. 12. 5. The War Cabinet had under its consideration Joint note no. 12 from the Military representatives at Versailles, and a telegramfrom Sir William Robertson, dated 25th January, 1918 (Paper G.T.-3440), referring to it.General Maurice gave some information about the present strength of the Turkish forces and other matters bearing upon theabove.The War Cabinet were of opinion that the question of thegeneral scheme for military operations for the year 1918raised by the Joint Note should be discussed at the forth-coming meeting of the Supreme War Council at Versailles,and gave full authority to the Prime Minister and lord milner to represent the War Cabinet in connection withany decision that might be arrived at by the Supreme WarCouncil.Sinking of German C. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that the mines whichTorpedo-boats. caused the loss of the two German torpedo-boats &quot;A.. 75&quot; and&quot; A. 77,&quot; as reported in the press, were probably British.Submarines. 7. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that it was reported thata German submarine had probably been blown up by mines off they    Start.The &quot; Goeben.&quot; 8. With reference to War Cabinet 330, Minute 4, the deputy first Sea Lord stated that 49 British aeroplanes had attacked the3&quot; &quot; &quot;Goeben&quot; between S a.m. on the 23rd and S a.m. on the  24thh&quot;. s i - instant, and that 72 cwt. of bombs had been dropped on her, on theships and boats round her. and on the aerodrome at Galata. Four-direct hits with heavy bombs were reported on the &quot; Goeben,&quot; andone which sank a small ship alongside her. He also stated that two british submarines had arrived in the neighbourhood of the Darda-nelles, and that the Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean wasalso in that area.i/9. The War Cabinet had before them memoranda on theControl of Road Transport by the President of the Board of Trade(Paper G.T.-339G), and by the Minister of Reconstruction (paper g.T.-3435).Sir Albert Stanley stated that the attention of the Board ofTrade had been drawn to the desirability of co-ordinating various forms of horse and mechanical road transport, so that more effective use could be made of them. It was proposed to set up a road transport Board, consisting of representatives of each of thefollowing Departments : Board of Trade (Petroi Control Department),Board of Trade (Horse Transport Department),Ministry of Munitions,Ministry of Food,War Office,Post Office,And that the Terms of Reference should be : &quot; To co-ordinate the work of the existing GovernmentDepartments in connection with road transport; to determine what further measures are necessary to ensure the most economic use of road transport vehicles  and their efficientControl of road transport.
allocation for meeting such requirements as may arise fromtime to time for the transport of food, munitions, and other warmaterial, and for the essential needs of the trade and industry of the country ; and, subject to the direction oi the Board ofTrade, to give effect thereto.&quot;With regard to Dr. Addisoivs request for representation, hethought it might be met by sending to the Minister of Reconstruc-tion, as to the other Departments interested, copies of the Agenda ofthe Board and extracts from the Minutes. Representatives of anyof these Departments could be summoned to attend whenever anyquestion affecting that particular Department arose. It was intendedto ask Sir Evan Jones to become Chairman of the Board. Sir albert stanley said that there was no intention of interfering with military transport.Lord Derby said that the War Office was prepared to help inevery way to make the scheme a success.The War Cabinet decided To approve the scheme as outlined by the President of theBoard of Trade.Food allowances to railway workers.V10. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to the positionof certain railwaymen who, owing to the long and irregular hoursthey were obliged to work, were put to great inconvenience at thepresent time in obtaining food when away from home.Sir John Cowans thought it would be quite possible for the W arOffice to assist this special class of workers from army stores, byissuing allowances of food to the Railway Executive, for distribution.The War Cabinet approved the suggestion put forward by the quarter-Master-General.Compensation to 11. Sir Albert Stanley called attention to the demand for specialai waymen. compensation which was being pressed by certain classes of railway-men who had to continue working during air raids. At present theywere only entitled to be dealt with under the Workmen&apos;s Com-pensation Act, whereas they wished to be put on an equality withsoldiers.The War Cabinet decided that /      The demand of the railwaymen, as put forward by the President^ of the Board of Trade, should be conceded.Propaganda at 12. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by home. Sir Edward Carson, on Propaganda at Home, covering communications from Major-General Swinton and Lord Denbigh (Paper G.T.-3410).Sir Edward Carson was strongly of opinion that the most valuableform of propaganda in this country would be lectures by woundedofficers and by escaped prisoners of war.Lord Derby was strongly opposed to the suggestion, on grounds of discipline. If officers were allowed to lecture on behalf of theWar Aims Committee, it woidd be impossible to resist demands frompacifists to use private soldiers as speakers at their meetings. Itwas a question largely of uniform. If the men were not in uniform,their value as speakers would be greatly diminished.General Cockerill said be bad discussed the matter with theDirector of Personal Services, and they were agreed that the proposal would react injuriously on army discipline. At present, if soldiersare found attending a meeting, they are ordered to move on by theProvost-Marshal. A very awkward situation might arise in cases of disagreement between soldiers in the audience and officers on the platform.
Mr. Churchill said it should, be possible for the Government,with all its machinery, to make its propaganda far more effective than that of the pacifist organisations. The objections to thepresent proposal could be met by forbidding any soldier in khaki tolecture except by the special authorisation of the Army Council.Captain Guest stated that the War Aims Committee wasconstantly being asked for speakers with experience of the war. Hewould like to submit to the War Office a. list of officers and men with experience of the war and of public speaking who could beattached to the War Aims Committee for a short experimental period.Mr. G. H. Roberts said he would like to see such men used for propaganda, but it would be difficult to withhold permission from men opposed to the war. He was of opinion that the proposal would lead to trouble.Sir George Cave agreed that there would be an outcry, but hethought the gain was sufficiently great to outweigh the opposition.Lord Robert Cecil thought the arguments for and against thescheme were very evenly balanced, but on the whole he favoured it.It was pointed out that the War Cabinet could not ovelook the fact that the Government had become definitely and officiallyresponsible for propaganda. The Government was, in effect, runninga Propaganda Department and financing it, and it was competent,therefore, to give instructions to soldiers attached to the Department.The War Cabinet decided that The War Office should release officers and men for short periods for the service of the War Aims Committee.2, Whiteltall Gardens, S.W.,January 26, 1918.o
