The western front:German Attack :Present Position.1. The War Cabinet met to consider the enemy attack on theWestern front now in progress, and such action as might be desir-able to relieve the position. The situation was explained by ColonelKirke, of the General Staff, who, in accordance with the arrange-inent approved by the War Cabinet on the previous day (WarCabinet 370, Minute 2), had just arrived by aeroplane fromGeneral Headquarters, where he had seen General DavidsonColonel Kirke stated that the enemy&apos;s attack had started with avery heavy bombardment lasting from 2 to 4- hours and consistingmainly of high explosive shells, although some poison gashad also been used. The enemy bad. then advanced in a mist,which bad prevented our aeroplanes from obtaining muchinformation, and had hampered our artillery and machine-guns. In spite of this, enormous slaughter had undoubtedly been inflicted on the enemy in places. There was no doubtthat the enemy was taking every risk to gain a great success,for example, before his attack the enemy had brought up over100 batteries into the open near Queant, where they had been heavily shelled by our heavy artillery. On the Third Army front the enemy had, in the main, been held firmly on the battle zone,except at Mory, where it was reported he had penetrated. Thesituation in the vicinity of Mory was not quite clear, but 2 divi-sions had been brought up to deal with it, and 5 more divisions were being brought into the Arras region in case the enemy shouldeffect a serious penetration at this point and attempt to swingup north. Of these 5 divisions the first would arrive to-morrow,and the whole within four days. Colonel Kirke added thatMonchy-le-Preux, which had been heavily bombarded bythe enemy, had been evacuated under orders, to conform with other movements. On the Tifth Army front the enemy had succeeded in penetrating our battle zone and reserve lines, and aretirement had, in consequence, been made to the line of the somme. This retirement, he believed, had been carried out in good order, although the troops which had retreated some 12 miles werenaturally very tired. Practically all the reserve divisions on theTifth Army front had now come into line. The total Britishcasualties were estimated roughly at 40,000, and probably not lessthan. 600 guns, had been lost, including, perhaps, 100 heavy guns.Supplies of ammunition, however, had been placed in rear positions,so that the batteries were able to replenish their stocks and to retire fighting. The original lines that our armies had held before the battle of the Somme,were now being got ready, allpossible labour being brought up to work on them. The french were to-day taking over the line as far as St. Simon, and it was hoped that they would take over very shortly along the line of theSdinme&apos; as far as Ham. and later as far as Peronne. Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig had gone to-day to meet GeneralPdtain with a view to arranging this.No information had been received of the use of tanks by theenemy, nor had there been any new poison gas development. - 30enemy aeroplanes bad been destroyed on the previous day.Comparison ofAllied and enemy forces.A2. From information given partly by the Director of military intelligence and partly by Colonel Kirke, it appeared that 49German divisions had already been identified as engaged on the battle front. General Headquarters estimated that beyond this there were probably 10 divisions in immediate reserve which mightor might not have been engaged, and that there were an additional30 divisions behind, which could be brought into action. TheDirector of Military Intelligence estimated that, in addition to the49 divisions in the battle front, there were 53, and possibly 55,German divisions in reserve on the whole of the Western front.Another 9 or 10 divisions might be expected from the East.
3WC 371     180From figures given by the Director of Military intelligence and Director of Military&apos; Operations it appeared that the com-parison of enemy and Allied forces was as follows: Germany: Divisions ...       ...       ... 191Rifle strength     ............    1,402,800A Hies: Divisions.French       ...       ...       - - -       - -       - - -       - - -   ^9British      ..................5 Portuguese ... *Belgian     ...      ...       - -       - -      - -      - -     &quot;American ...       ...       - - -       - - -       - -(None as yet available for heavy fighting.)165Rifle strength     ............    1,418,000It was  pointed  out that  the rifle strength of the Alliesincluded 49,000 Americans, 58,000 Belgians, and 26,000 portuguese-guese.   The Chief of the Imperial General Staff considered that., for purposes of calculation, the present forces might be reckonedis    as approximately equal.French Assistance. 3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff pointed out thatthe British Army was now attacked by a large proportion of theGerman Army, and was menaced with a possible attack by thewhole. It was clear that the size of our army was not sufficient toenable us to cope with so heavy an attack whatever measures mightbe taken in regard to man-power, and that French assistance wasindispensable. It had to be remembered, however, that the french were themselves expecting an attack in Champagne, and wemust not make too great a demand upon them until the situation there was clearer. Ee had ascertained that what Field-marshal sir Douglas Haig desired was that the French should take overthe line of the Somme as soon as possible as far as Ham, andshortly after as far as Peroime. This would ease the immediate situation. As Colonel Kirke had pointed out. the Field-Marshalwas in consultation with General Petain on the subject to-day.The question was then raised as to whether it was necessaryto put any political pressure on the French Government to renderus the necessary assistance, and it was suggested that the PrimeMinister or some other Member of the War Cabinet might proceedto Paris for the purpose.The Prime Minister pointed out that if the Versailles schemefor the constitution and control of the Allied General Reserve had only been brought into full operation, it would not have been necessary to have this bargaining process with the French, but thatthe Executive War Board would have decided immediately as tothe disposition of the forces.The War Cabinet had no reason to suppose that the french would show any reluctance, and decided-That the question of putting political pressure on the FrenchGovernment need not arise until the result of Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s conference with General/ Petain was known.Divisions from 4. With reference to War Cabinet 370, Minute 4, the ChiefItaly. of the Imperial. General Staff informed the War Cabinet that theExecutive War Board had decided, in view of the present situa-tion on the Western, front, to alter the order in which the divisions&quot;&quot;[4365-371] B 2
were to be transported from the Italian to the Western front to thefollowing: 2 French divisions,4 Brigades of British field artillery,1 British division.All the above to precede any Italian divisions.Possible lieinforce-ments from palestine.5. The War Cabinet considered the possibility of bringingreinforcements from Palestine to meet the present emergency onthe Western front. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff saidthat a proposal had been made by the Permanent Military Repre-sentatives at Versailles that a certain number of White battalionsshould be brought from Egypt to Prance. He stated that therewere 3 British divisions in Egypt. In this connection attention was drawn to a telegram from the Commander-in-Chief in India(No. 22677), dated the 21st March, expressing anxiety about thepossible developments in the East consequent on the collapse ofRussia, and the&quot; resulting danger to our position in India. the telegram drew attention to an arrangement which had formerlyexisted, and had never been cancelled, under which 2 british divisions had been maintained at Salonica or Egypt as a potentialemergency reserve for India, (War Committee Paper W.C.-33,Minute 1 (b).)The War Cabinet decided that The question should be reserved for further consideration.Possible Beinforce-ments from mesopotamia,Z .36. The suggestion was made that an Indian division, whichis under orders to move from Mesopotamia to Palestine, might besent straight through to Marseilles as a reinforcement to theBritish Expeditionary Force in France. It was pointed out thatthe division could not leave Basra for another week, and that no immediate derision was necessary.Field-Marshal Lord French pointed out that an indian division was not quite equal in lighting value to a British division,even in. summer, and was of comparatively small value on theWestern front for climatic reasons.The War Cabinet decided that The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should ask Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Plaig if he would care to have an indian division.Possible Eeinforce-menfcs fromSalonioa.3.7. The War Cabinet agreed with the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff that None of the 4 British divisions (with one brigade) in theSalonica theatre, should be brought to France, since,although up to strength numerically, they were weakenedby malaria.Man-Power;reinforcements from HomeSources.8. General Hutchinson made a statement of the resources inthis country from which drafts could be furnished for the western front Infantrymen.(I.) (a.) Drafts under orders to go overseas betweenthe 23rd and 31st March       ... ...    9,800(&amp;.) From cyclist brigades, by substituting boys    5,000(c.) From the 214th Brigade, by substitutingboys ... ... ... ...    2,000(d.) From Guards Reserve ... ... ...    1,200(e.) Specialists under training, chiefly signallers    5,000
(/.) From   some   5,000   N.C.O.&apos;s   undergoingvarious courses, some ... ... ...      500(g.) Drafts for other theatres, diverted        ...    2,000(h.) On leave, lent to Agriculture     ... ...    1,500All these were available at once, or in avery short time, and together made a total of 27,000(II.) Men on leave from France, returning at the rateof about 6,000 a day      ... ... ...  88,000(III.) Boys over 18-J but under 19 years of age, whohave completed their training       ... ...  50,000(IV.) From 10,000 &quot; A &quot; men being trained to becomeofficers in various Cadet Units, half of whommight be taken, on the understanding that ifthey survived this emergency they would receivetheir commissions ... ... ...    5,000(V.) In addition to the above, there were 29,000 menin munition works who were trained soldiers,and who could be called up at three days&apos;notice for home defence.   Of these it might bepossible to claim ... ... ...   16,000(VI.) Of 63,000 men in agriculture, some 80 per cent.were trained soldiers, but mostly ungraded, say   45,000In addition to the above there were 30,000 drafts in depotsin Fiance.In the ensuing discussion on these figures it was pointed outthat, including the 88,000 men on leave, the 27,000 men of group(I.), the 50,000 boys of group (III), and the 5,000 men of group(IV), we had a force of some 170,000 which could be moved as fast as transport capacity allowed. In practice it was found possible to move about 8,000 men a day. The transport of this force would, therefore, take up the whole of our cross-Channeltransport capacity during the next three weeks, which could beexpected to be the period of severest trial. The other categoriesmight be reserved for later consideration, as it was evident thatthe calling up of large numbers from munition work and from agriculture must seriously affect tiio.se industries, and deservedfurther study.The question was asked whether any help could be obtainedfrom the Colonial troops.   The following figures were given: The Canadians &quot;had 2,000 men over establishment in France,and 1,500 trained men in this country.The Australians were 1,000 over strength in France, and had  ,300 men under training in England.   These habituallywent out in trained batches of 100.The New Zealand forces were 5,000 above strength in France,and had very few trained men in England.With reference to these figures it was pointed out that the88,000 men on leave were on the establishment in France, and could not be counted as an addition to Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s forces;secondly, that the despatch overseas of the 50,000 boys betweenthe ages of and 19 was not only an expenditure of capital forwhich no immediate substitute could be found, and a very notableweakening of the Home Forces, but that this step required aspecial decision of the War Cabinet, in view of the undertaking that boys of this age should not be sent abroad save in case ofnational emergency.With reference to the last point, it was decided by the WarCabinet that The emergency had arisen, and that the trained contingent of boys of this age should be sent overseas..
New Man-PowerProposals invited.9. The War Cabinet decided that The Minister of National Service should immediately putforward proposals with a view to an increase in thetotal amount of man-power procurable for military services. His proposals should deal not only with,measures for speeding up recruiting from all existingsources, but also for surmounting the many obstaclesthat stand in the way of the full mobilisation of ourman-power, and for tapping such new sources as still remain.The Minister of National Service was asked to bear in mind that the present military situation might afford an exceptional opportunity for overcoming difficulties that had hitherto proved insurmountable.Stoppage of recruitment forthe Royal Navj\^Release of men employed by theAdmiralty.10. The following suggestions were made: 3*//&apos;(a-) That in view of the pressing need for military recruits,&apos;X0 . recruiting should be stopped for the Royal Navy of1 men lit for general service over the age of 18 years.(&amp;.) That the Admiralty should, according to their previousundertaking, expedite the release of 12,500 men fromAdmiralty &quot;A&quot; firms, and of 1,000 men from the royal dockyards under the schedule of protected occupations(MM. 130, Revised).The Secretary was instructed to write to the First Lord of/    the Admiralty on this subject.Communication byC.I.G.S. to Field-Marshal Sir douglas haig.11. The War Cabinet asked the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff to communicate immediately with Field-marshal sir Douglas Haig in the following sense: (1.) That in addition to the 88,000 men in this country on leave, he could count on the despatch of about 82,000drafts (a total of 170,000 men) requiring three weeksfor their transport.(2.) That the question of maintaining&apos; a constant stream ofdrafts after this was under consideration.(3.) The decision of the Executive War Board to bring theFrench and British divisions- from Italy before theItalian divisions.(4.) To ask the Field-Marshal if he was satisfied as to theextent of the co-operation being given by the FrenchGovernment.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March 23, 1918.o
