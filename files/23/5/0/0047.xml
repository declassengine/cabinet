The WesternPront:Strength of theGerman Army.Provision forLady Maude.Case of CaptainWilson, M.P.Palestine.Mesopotamia.1. THE Chancellor of the Exchequer asked for the facts inregard to the following statement by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of the War Office:  &quot; The strength of the German army on the Western frontis already far greater than it has been in any previous periodof the war, and although the Allies are at present superior,both in men and guns, tire balance will soon be in favour of theenemy.&quot;The Secretary pointed out, and the Director of Military Opera-tions agreed, that the position might be stated in the following way :Although the Allies would always have superiority on the whole front from the Channel to the Adriatic, nevertheless, on the western front there was a danger lest in May next the enemy might have thesuperiority.The War Cabinet decided that-The Chancellor of the Exchequer should modify the statementof the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of the War Office,by stating the actual position in the above sense.2. With reference to War Cabinet 328, Minute 12, the Chancellorof the Exchequer stated that the question of Lady Maude&apos;s pensionhad been taken in hand by the Treasury, and proposals would beintroduced in the House of Commons next Monday, when he hoped the Prime Minister would take the necessary action.3. The Chancellor of the Itlxchequer said that Captain StanleyWilson, M.P , who considered that he had been unjustly condemnedby a Court of Enquiry, was anxious to be allowed a court-martial.He had been asked to give up his Commission, and this practicallymeant that he could not remain in the House of Commons.The Secretary of State lor War understood that an appeal tothe King under section 42 of the Army Act was about to be made.Pending its receipt he could not express an opinion.4. The Director of Military Operations reported that general allenby had made progress to the north and east. The enemy&apos;scavalry were still in small numbers to the west of the Jordan insome places, and an engagement had taken place on the previous day in which they had been driven back. The total change on thatfront was not material, but the port of Pujm-el-Bahr, at the northend of the Dead Sea, which had been used by the Turks, had been occupied by our troops.f). The Director of Military Operations stated that general marshall reported that the Turkish position at Hit had been bombed and that our patrols were in touch with the enemy at Hit.Evidently General marshals intention was to take Hit bysurrounding it, in much the same way as we had capturedRaniadie.Hospital Ship ^. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that Swansea reported,Torpedoed. that the Hospital Ship   &quot; Glen art Castle,&quot; bound from Newport(Monmouth) to Brest, had been torpedoed without warning, six miles to the North of Hartland Point. The ship was showing all herlights; she sank in about seven minutes. There were no patientson board, but the crew and medical staff numbered about 200.Twenty-four survivors had been landed at Swansea, and nine atMilford, but there were still eight-or nine boats adrift. Admiral* Hope pointed out that this vessel had been sunk inside the free area
3 WG 355The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Admiralty, when publishing the news of this Joss,should lay stress on the fact that the &quot; Glenart Castle &quot;was in the free area, and was sunk in breach of theGerman pledge.(6.) The Foreign Office should telegraph to Spain, instructingthe British Ambassador to communicate   the   detailsprivately to the King of Spain,(c.) The Admiralty should at once communicate the facts to theMinister of Information, with a view to their widespreaddissemination.Ooal for Italy. 7. With reference to War Cabinet 351, Minute 3, the WarCabinet had before them a Report on General Transportation on thel^. / . Western Front, by Major-General Xash (Paper G.T.-371U).3. Lord Robert Cecil expressed the view that the French had made out a case for the supply of coal for their railways, involving ademand for ^ 1(5,000 tons of coal. General Nash and Mr. Capel hadtyf^. S^yZ 30th confirmed this. Lord Robert Cecil recalled that he hadexchanged letters with M. Clemenceau, who had made a strong pointof the fact that the French only use 4,000,000 tons of coal a month,whereas we consume 15,000,000 tons a month. This statement,which at first had appeared a bad argument, insomuch as we areproducers of coal, nevertheless, on examination, was found to havelO some force, owing to the fact that a great part of our coal wascarried coastwise in ships which could be utilised for cross-Channelpurposes. Lord Robert Cecil urged an examination of the wholequestion of coastwise transport, with a view to an alleviation of theshipping situation. He further suggested that there should be a drastic revision of the train services in this country.The Minister of Shipping supported Lord Robert Cecil to theextent that he had already urged that there should be a stoppage ofnon-essential traffic and cross-trafficIt was stated summon steps had already been taken to avoidcross-traffic by confining the consumption of coal and beer to the districts in which these commodities were obtained. It was under-stood that the Food Controller was also making arrangements forthe distribution of margarine and meat supplied locally.Sir Guy Granct pointed out that London had always been fedto the extent of 50 per cent, by rail. This amount was nowincreased. The Midland Railway was sending 70 big trains aday to London, which was considerably more than in pre-war times.He pointed out that General NaslTs report showed that, bad as theV: situation was in France, the French had more locomotives and morewagons now than they had at the beginning of the war. InEngland, on the other hand, there was less rolling-stock, moretraffic, and a considerably greater percentage of loss.The President of the Board of Trade pointed out that trafficcould not be cut down without very severe restriction. At the pre-sent time, he said, the railways were carrying more traffic, bothpassenger and freight, than before the war. It was true that morepassenger trains could be taken off, but this could be done only upon sentimental grounds unless a large number were withdrawn.The congestion on the railways was largely due to terminaldifficulties.The Minister of Shipping outlined the Italian coal position as.follows: Tons per Month.The French Government had agreed to send ... 240,000They would rail extra  British coal throughFrance ... ... ... ...    110,000To be sent from England through France byBlaye... ... ...      &quot;   ... 90,000To be sent by sea from England      ... ...   -150,000Total ... ...    590,000
The Minister of Shipping stated that the quantities to go by-rail would go partly by rail all the way and partly by sea fromMarseilles, the Italian and French tonnage now- in the Mediterraneanbeing used for the latter purpose.General Nash, on the other hand, said that he had beeninformed in Rtnne that shipping was hot available in theMediterranean.Lord Robert Cecil drew attention to a, telegram, sent to LordBertie on the 2(Jth February (No. 435), in which, it was stated thatwe had received through the Italian Ambassador an official statement that the French Government had agreed with Signor Crespi thatthey should provide for Italy at. the rate of 240,000 tons of French coalper month up to tire 1st April, it was further agreed that theywould rail up to 110,000 tons of British coal, imported through theGironde or Rochefort. This undertaking had been accepted bySignor Crespi, and it was important that no other arrangement should be made which would in any way modify the obligation soassumed by the French Government, on which we should hence-forward rely. We would do our- utmost on our side to assist in meeting Italy&apos;s needs.Sir Joseph. Maclay gave an account of an interview withM. Clementel in Paris on this subject, in which Sir Joseph had asked M. Clementel to provide the 350,000 tons from Frenchsources. M. Clementel at first was very difficult, and there was a somewhat heated, discussion, but on the following day they had metagain, and the French agreed to go on with about 8,000 tons a day,but. this had not been carried out. Compensation was not pro-promised.As to this, General Nash said that he believed that the Frenchcould not carry out their bargain without danger to the strategical situation by the depletion of their coal supplies. He insisted thatthe trucks were not, available for the carriage of 410,000 tons by rail, even if the Marseilles-Genoa sea route were employed. In his view 270,000 tons a month was the maximum amount that could besent by all-rail route, whereas under the above scheme the total amount required to be carried was 440,000 tons a month, leaving170,000 tons to be handled by Marseilles-Genoa route.Lord Robert Cecil pointed out that there were two separateproblems, namely : (a.) Coal to Italy ;(6.) Strategical coal to France.The War Cabinet were of opinion that it was essential to send the coal to Italy. For this it was necessary for the French to carry-out their bargain. The French could not do this without danger,unless their own needs for coal, for mihiirv purposes were made good. This could only be. done at the expense of our shipping, andby our sacrifice of something else, such as our coasting trade or the diversion of tonnage from some other purpose, it, being clearly understood that in no case was the food supply of this country to beaffected&apos;by any re-allocation, of tonnage.The War Cabinet inclined strongly to the view that it wasvitally necessary to make good the French shortage. They decidedthat: -A Conference should be held at the Board of Trade to considerways and means, at which General Nash should be askedto attend.Lord Robert Cecil undertook to notify the War Cabinet of theresult of the Conference.8. In connection with the previous Minute, the Minister ofShipping called attention to the very little assistance which wasbeing received from America in the solution of our problems.   for united states assistance.
instance, American troops in France, who, General Nash stated,were 450 miles from their base, were occupying waggons taken from french and British resources, whereas they had promised to get their own waggons over from America. The Americans were there-fore indirectly helping to prevent coal going to Italy. Again, the americans, who had promised to assist us in transporting their troops loin this country to France, had not yet sent the four coastaltransports which they had agreed to despatch. The Americans were still using their steamers, such as the &quot; St. Louis&quot; and the &quot;St. Paixl,&quot;in the passenger trade, while we were carrying their troops in oursteamers. On. the other hand we were, out of our resources, givingthe United States every assistance. We were, for instance, pro-viding them with blankets and clothing made out of wool which wehad imported from Australia, &amp;c, and which we could ill afford to spare.he War Cabinet asked- The Minister of Shipping to draw up a statement of the case,pointing out the grievances which he had enumerated,which should be submitted to the Foreign Office to be forwarded to Washington.Railway Transport n. With reference to War Cabinet 351, Minute 2, the  Wa^       in France: Cabinet decided that-. J       General Nash&apos;sReport. tjit?        The Secretary should send a copy of General Nash&apos;s report to^Versailles, inviting the views of the military representa-,        ^     -&quot;vfives on the subject, and arranging that the matter should^ ,-.of be discussed at the next meeting of the Supreme War. .   y      yO. i* yS/v1-- i.    Council.Poison Gas, 10. With reference to War Cabinet 350, Minute 6, GeneralThuillier was asked to give an estimate of British efficiency in the.&quot;2^.^-/ matter of gas, and of the threatened  measures on the part of3. Germany.    He stated that the rumours on the latter point werevague and contradictory,   if, as most of the evidence indicated, the&quot;  Germans meant to use a gas of the hydrocyanic type, such a gas -jk        was inferior to that used by ourselves and to their own previous/ys^&quot;       &apos;    gases.    Our masks and the French masks were proof   againsta gas of this sort.   It was possible, on this hjmothesis, that thedisplay of advertisement by Germany of a coming gas attack was deliberately intended to incite the propaganda of the GenevaS\ Red Cross for the stoppage of gas altogether.   Since July, how-ever, the Germans had used a new type of gas, composed of minute particles of a substance which, if effectively dischargedinto the atmosphere, could penetrate the masks with which our troops were furnished. But they had failed, so far, to discovermeans of discharging this new form of gas in a dangerous way, andthere was no evidence as yet of a single casualty in the british forces due to that cause. It was possible, nevertheless, that thisgas would be used in shells with a very high detonation, or even inclouds emitted out of cylinders. Clouds of gas were affected bywinds, and on the Western front the chances against a wind favour-able to the Germans were as six to one. Consequently, as theGerman mask was decidedly inferior to ours, and quite inadequate to protect their troops against such a gas if blown back on them, itwas unlikely that an attack, with such a gas&quot; would take place.Precautions were being taken. A completely new mask would takea ldng time to make, but a temporary addition, to the mask atpresent in use was being prepared which would afford protection against this form of attack should it occur. In a few weeks manyhundreds of thousands would be ready. Questioned as to improve-ments in the gas used by..our own forces, General Thuillier said thatexperiments were being made of gases which would penetrate the[1365-355] C
German mask. These experiments were not as yet conclusive.There might, be useful results in two or three months. Manyscientific men of great authority were working at the subject.General Thuillier further explained that it is always a matter ofgreat difficulty to use gas in an attack, as its use depends onweather, which cannot be forced to harmonise with a time-table, as other preparations lor an attack must. Its rise was practicallyconfined to conditions of stagnant, trench warfare, when favourable weather could he waited for. The same considerations militatedagainst, its employment save in shells for defensive operations ;.the troops resented the presence of cylinders in the line, as theywere liable to be burst, to their own detriment, by the enemy&apos;sbombardment. Questioned as to the likelihood of an improvementin the German gas-masks, General Thuillier stated that there wasno information, but that the lack of rubber in Germany wasunfavourable to any great improvement. Leather had been tried by the enemy, but had proved, a failure. Their present mask was good against phosgine and chlorine gases, but latterly we had foundmeans of using these gases in such a way as to cause the enemygreat casualties.The apprehension was expressed that the agitation concerningthe use of gas portended some new and deadly device, as the pre-vious charge against us of using it had preceded its unprovokedemployment in the second battle of Ypres.It was pointed out, as against this, that the enemy had nottrumpeted the advent of the mustard gas, which had done us much     -p^harm, and that the indications were rather that the enemy was nowbeaten at his own game, and would welcome the stoppage of gasattacks altogether.11. With reference to War Cabinet 320, Minute 9, the WarDefence of London Cabinet had before them a Report by Lord French and by the Chiefagainst Air Raids.     Qf ^ Iraper:al General Staff (Paper G.T.-3I595).The Director of Military Operations explained that the Field-Marshal had been asked to devise plans for the protection of Londonagainst aerial attack by a maximum of eighty machines. TheReport embodied his proposals. There was, at the same time, ademand for guns to protect our aerodrome near Nancy, from whichbombing raids on German towns were made. It was not possibleto satisfy both demands in the matter of guns. It was therefore proposed that the 3-inch 20-cwt. guns available should be retained for Inane defence, and that lighter gutfs should go to Nancy. TheField-Marshal also asked for two additional squadrons of aeroplanes,but we had not such a superiority on the Western front as t -warrant the granting of this request. sir L. Worthington Evans remarked that the situation wouldbe relieved were it possible for the Admiralty to redivert some of thehigh-angle guns lately supplied to them. The same applied tosearchlights, in which the Field-Marshal was deficient, and some ofwhich might be spared by the Admiralty. Some of the old battle-ships and cruisers for example, Iiis Majest3&apos;-&apos;s ship &quot; Queen,&quot; atTarantc, and vesseis outside submarine area on distant stations-could, perhaps, spare some searchlights.The General Staff proposal that Home Defence should, for thepresent, be given precedence over France as regards the heavier anti-aircraft guns, but that France should haveprecedence as regards aeroplanes, was agreed to.It was also decided that The General Staff should arrange for a conference with theMinistry of Munitions and the Admiralty to consider thepossibility referred to, of diverting more guns and search-lights to the defence of London.
Prisoners of War:Labour and Food.13. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandumby the Secretary of State for the Culonies re the feeding of Germansoldier and alien civilian prisoners working on the land as comparedwith our own agricultural labourers (Paper G.T.-3538).The War Cabinet requested-The Secretary of State for War and the Food Controller, inconjunction with the Prisoners of War Department, to dealwith the point raised by the Secretary of State for theColonies.Australian Wheat:Proposed furtherPurchase14. The War Cabinet had before them Interim Report No. 10of the Economic Offensive Committee, covering a statement by theRoyal Commission on Wheat Supply as to a further purchase ofwheat in Australia (Paper G.-1D7).Impressed by the desirability of obtaining complete control overwheat shipments from Australia, both at the present time and in theperiod immediately following the conclusion of peace, and also bythe political difficulties which will arise if Mr. Hughes has trouble in fulfilling his guarantee to bis farmers, the War Cabinet approved in principle the opening of negotiations for the purchase of thesurplus Australian wheat. They were of opinioD that these negotiations should be regarded not primarily as of a commercialcharacter, but as aimed at effecting, in the general interests, a settle-ment of certain outstanding questions between the Imperial and commonwealth Governments. In particular, the following objectsshould be borne in mind :  (a.) That an agreement satisfactory to the Ministry of shipping should be obtained from the Commonwealth government as to tonnage arrangements.(b.) That the financial arrangements should be such as to safe-guard the parity of exchanges between this country and australia, the purchase-money being set off against the cash claims of the War Office in respect of the main-tenance of Australian troops(c.) That the price paid should not exceed the figure ofMr. Hughes&apos; guarantee to the farmers, with an allowance for expenses.The War Cabinet decided that The drafting of telegrams and negotiation of details should bein the hands of a Committee representing the Treasury,the Ministry of Shipping, and the Royal Commission on wheat Supplies, and that the proposals of this CommitteeProvision of Cover 12. With reference to War Cabinet 320, Minute 9, the Warduring Air raids . Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor War (Paper G.T.-3263) embodying an appeal from theinhabitants of Sheerness.The Home Secretary pointed out that the Home Office could notbe responsible outside the Metropolitan District.The President of the Local Government Board remarked thatany provision of shelters outside that area would bring about ademand for equivalent protection within it.It was generally agreed that, while shelters should be providedfor people in the streets at the time of an air raid, the remaindershould be encouraged to stay at home, ami that any attempt toprovide bomb-proof retreats for the whole population was impracticable-able and useless.It was also stated that compensation was being paid by theTreasury on behalf of civilians killed or injured by air raids onthe lines of the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act.
shotdd be transmitted to the Commonwealth government through the Colonial Office and the Governor-General, andshould be subject to the approval of: the Secretary ofState for the Colonies.15. With reference to War Cabinet 323, Minute 8, and WarCabinet 353, Minute 9, the War Cabinet had under consideration aMemorandum (Paper G.T.-3740) from the President of the Board ofTrade, proposing the appointment of a Paper Controller, to be underthe Board of Trade, the necessity for such being agreed to by theMinister of Munitions and the Chairman of the Royal Commissionon Paper.It was proposed that the existing Paper Commission, with any necessary modifications, should become an Advisory Council, or be incorporated in a system of Advisory Committees, the Ministry ofAlunitions being strongly represented.The War Cabinet approved the proposals of the President ofthe Board of Trade, which would, it was understood,C supersede the existing organisations dealing with paper.Appointment of paper Controller.Sinn Fein 1(5. With reference to War Cabinet 354, Minute 8, the Warlawlessness in Cabinet took note of a telegram, dated 26th February, 1918 (PaperIreland.
