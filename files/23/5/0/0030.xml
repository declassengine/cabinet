WITH reference to War Cabinet 331, Minute 4, the PrimeMinister reported that an important meeting had taken place at versailles on the 30th January, 1918, on the subject of theco-operation of United States troops with the British army. Thismeeting had been attended by- Generals Bliss and Pershing, onbehalf of the United States, and by himself, Lord Milner, Fielcl-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, General Sir William Robertson andSir Maurice Hankey. The Prime Minister explained to the Cabinetthe reluctance with which General Pershing viewed the inclusion of american battalions in British divisions, for political reasons. It wasfotmd, however, that General Pershiug raised no objection to american troops being used with British troops in training, and,since the best way of training troops would be by putting them inthe line, we could rest assured that a large number of Americaninfantrymen would be available for purposes of co-operation ; in fact,there was no limit as to numbers, other than the limit imposed bythe amount of shipping available and the rate at which we couldequip the American divisions with material. General Pershing hadstipulated that not only the infantry, but the whole fightingpersonnel of divisions should be brought over.
The Chief of the Imperial General Staff explained that the effectof this would be that, out of 1:)0,000 men broughtover,there wouldbe 90,000 men available as infantry for the American battalions inthe British brigades.The War Cabinet approved the final agreement  made withGeneral Pershing (Appendix).Establishment ofan Inter-allied general Reserve.Z.-  Hi.2, With reference to War Cabinet 329. Minute 13, the PrimeMinister stated that the most important question discussed at versailles was the creation of a General Reserve, in winch matter he drew attention to War Cabinet Paper PC-4 3 a. The proposedReserve would have two purposes : (a.) To support the line, whether in the portion held by theBritish, French, or Italians, at the point or pointsthreatened ;(6.) To take part in a counter-offensive.The discussion on this question bad lasted two days, and had resulted in complete and unanimous agreement between the fourAllies, who would all contribute to the formation of the general reserve. The Command of this General Reserve had been thesubject of separate proposals by each of the four national delegations,who had in principle all suggested the same scheme, namely, thatthe General Reserve should be under the control of a special Board,upon which each of the Allies would be represented by their military representatives on the Supreme War Council at Versailles, with theexception of the French. The French had selected General Foch as their representative on the Board, and, by the unanimous wish of therepresentatives of the four nations at Versailles, General Foch wouldpreside over the Board. In the event of any disagreement, thematter would be referred to the Supreme War Council. The question as to when, where, and to what extent the General Reserve shouldbe utilised or withdrawn would be decided by the Board. From themoment that any allocation of troops from the General Reserve hadbeen made by the Board, such troops would come under the command of the Commander-in-Chief in whose area they were to operate.The question of the composition of the General Reserve was leftto the Generals at Versailles to decide, in consultation with theCommander-in-Chief. He wished to make it clear that, while in theReserve, the troops of any particular Ally would be under the solecommand, as regards discipline, training, and organisation of officersof their own nationality.The Secretary of State for War stated that he had not yet had sufficient time to study the reports submitted in regard to thisquestion, and therefore must reserve judgment thereon.The Prime Minister pointed out, in reply, that, as the matter had been decided unanimously by the Allied representatives, and by himself and Lord Milner, who had been empowered by the WarCabinet with full Cabinet authority to deal with this question ontheir behalf, he trusted that the matter would be considered by theArmy Council in the most helpful spirit, and that there would be nodelay in preparing the necessary Order in Council, if such were required, to give effect to their decision.The War Cabinet took note of the following Agreement madeby the Prime Minister and Lord Milner, on their behalf, in accordancewith War Cabinet 329, Minute 13 (i) (b): (1.) The Supreme War Council decided on the creation of aGeneral Reserve for the whole of the armies on theWestern, Italian, and Balkan fronts.(2.) The Supreme War Council delegates to an Executivecomposed of the permanent military representatives of

APPENDIX.Memorandum.(A.) THIS memorandum refers to the request made by General Sir William Robertson, representing the British War Office, that the American Government sendby British shipping to France 150 battalions of infantry for service in British divisions on the Western front.Replying&apos; to this proposal, the following objections appear : 1. The national sentiment in the United States against service under a foreign-       flag-2. The probability that such action by the United States would excite serious political opposition to the administration in the conduct of the war.3. The certainty of its being used by German propagandists to stir up publicopinion against the war.4. It would dissipate the direction and effort of the American army.5. Differences in national characteristics and military training of troops and consequent failure of complete co-operation would undoubtedly lead tofriction and eventual misunderstanding between the two countries.6. Additional man-power on the Western front could be provided as quickly bysome plan not involving amalgamation.(B.) In order to meet the situation, as presented by General Sir William Robertson,and hasten the arrival and training of American troops, it is therefore proposed thatthe British Government use the available sea transportation in question for bringingover the personnel of entire American divisions under the following conditions :- 1. That the infantry and auxiliary troops of these divisions be trained with british divisions by battalions, or under such plan as may be agreed upon.2. That the artillery be trained under American direction in the use of Frenchmaterial, as at present.3. That the higher commanders and staff officers be assigned for training and experience with corresponding units for the British army.4. That when sufficiently trained, these battalions be reformed into regiments, andthat when the artillery is fully trained, all the units comprising each divisionbe united under their own officers for service.5. That the above plan be carried out without interference with the plans now inoperation for bringing over American forces.6. That question of supply be arranged by agreement between the British and american Commanders-in-Chief.7. That question of arms and equipment be settled in similar manner.(Signed) JOHN J. PERSHING,Commander-in-01 def American Army.January 28, 1918.o
