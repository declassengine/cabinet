Submarines. 1. The First Sea, Lord of the Admiralty stated that there were no great changes in the naval situation. An explosion had occurredwhilst a patrol boat was attacking a submarine, but it was notyet known if the submarine was sunk.A hospital ship had been torpedoed in the Bristol Channel,but there was no loss of life, with the exception of three Lascars.Vtedivost k &apos;2- Tlie First ^ea Lord stated tnat one    Suffolk &quot; had been ordered to Vladivostock, first calling at Sasebo, with instructions^^y-/ to act with the Japanese authorities and report on the situation.2 Lord Robert Cecil said he thought that the Japanese ultimatelyintended to seize Vladivostock, but that they woidd not do so atpresent.In this connection, attention was called to telegram No. 7uj^C,3oy/J      from Sir C. Greene. Tokyo, dated the 5th January, 1918, which&apos;      stated that the Japanese had complained of a- want of franknesson the part of the British Government, and that the Japanese didnot propose to act independently at Vladivostock.^ i   -/. Lord Robert Cecil emphasised the effect upon Russian opinionyj&apos; if no Allied troops were present at the seizing of Vladivostock.The Russians would imagine that the Japanese were endeavouringto carry out the designs they had in the Russo-Japanese War.Also, the British Government desired to obtain the control of the siberian Railway, and if the Japanese went alone to Vladivostockit would make this operation much more difficult.The Chief of the imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that it would take four or five days to move the Britishtroops, wdiich were now at Hong Kong, to Vladivostock.The War Cabinet instructed The First Lord of the Admiralty to send the &quot;Suffolk &quot; to vladivostock in any case, and any decision the WarCabinet arrived at with regard to the despatch of troops would not affect the First Lord&apos;s instructions.-German divisions on the western front.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that theGermans were reorganising their army on the Western front, andthe formation of additional corps and one additional army had now given it the character of an offensive force. No more divisions had, however, been moved over from Russia recently,though the Germans had twenty-eight more divisions on theWestern front than they had this time last year.Poland.4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that a french report from Russia indicated that difficulties were beingS encountered in the formation of the Polish army.Salonica : Con- ,dition of russian troops.5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that General Guillaumat had reported that the conditionof the Russian units at Salonica was most unsatisfactory, and thathe (General Guillaumat) suggested sending these units to Tunis.Health of Troops.6. Lord Derby stated that he had received a disquieting tele-gram from Sir Ronald Ross (the tropical disease expert) regardingthe health of the troops at Salonica. The telegram stated that themen were saturated with malaria, and 15,000 of them should beremoved immediately. At present troops could not be relieved inthat theatre at a rate exceeding 2,000 a month.
8-15. The War Cabinet conferred with Field-Marshal sir douglas Haig on various questions connected with the position onthe Western front, and also the question of troops for Homey&amp;Apy&amp;y       Defence.   (Owing to (he secrecy of the matters dealt with, noi^V^.Minutes have been printed.)Russia.-7.2-&apos;1.6. Lord Robert Cecil reported that Mr. Lockhart. our lateConsul-General in Moscow, was now in this country, but wouldbe proceeding to Petrogrnd at the end of that week to take up his duties as the channel of communication with the Bolshevik party.In the Tueantiine Lord Robert Cecil had given instructions to our embassy at Petrograd to get someone outside the Embassy into touch with M. Trotzki. the selection being left to our presentrepresentative at Petrograd. He added that a difficult situation was being created in London by a demand that the funds and documents of the Russian Embassy should be handed over toM. Litvinoff. Lord Robert Cecil was strongly opposed to the idea,as the Funds of the Embassy would probably be spent byM. Litvinoff in spreading Bolshevik propaganda in this country.He understood that no fault could be found on personal groundswith M. Litvinoff.The Prime Minister drew attention to a press report which went to show that Mb Trotzki was quarrelling with the Germans,and that the Social Revolutionary Party, who were the only alter-natives to the Bolsheviks, were quite as likely, if not more likely,to give in to German demands as was M. Trotzki.Roumanta.2317. Lord Robert Cecil reported that information had beenreceived that some of the present Roumanian Ministry were anxious to make a separate peace. The King of Roumania was prepared to dismiss these Ministers if we wished him to do so.M. Clemenceau was in favour of this course. Lord Robert Cecilgathered that the Chief of the Imperial General Staff did not anticipate any Austro-German advance against the Roumanianarray, at any rate for two or three months. He had little faith inthe ability or determination of the Ukraine to resist such an advance, and the fifteen good divisions of the Roumanian armyconstituted the only military force wdiich prevented the Germansadvancing into the Ukraine and obtaining supplies. He addedthat if we left it to the discretion of the Roumanian government it would seem inevitable that they would make a separate peace.They could only be kept in the war by pressure from us and from france.Lord Milner pointed out that, if Roumania stayed in thefield, a certain number of Austro-German divisions, which could otherwise be released for service elsewhere, would be tiedup upon that front, It was doubtful whether it would suit Ger-man policy to overrun Roumanian territory by force, as itappeared inevitable that, sooner or later, Roumania would form part of the Central Bloc. He agreed that the Ukraine was afeeble reed upon which to lean, but there was an outside chance-316] B 2Casualty Lists. 7. A suggestion was made that the Weekly Casualty Report, . did not give sufficient details regarding the number of sick.7 ^ ^-r5^&apos; Sir Edward Carson stated that he had asked the Director-General of Medical Services to rectify this several times, but with no result.Lord Derby promised to look into the matter.Lord Derby added that the hospitals at Salonica were very good indeed, and, although there was a shortage of doctors, it wasnot a serious one.
of something materialising in that country if Roumania held on;whereas if lioumania went out, any idea of rallying the Ukrainewould be at an end.The Prime Minister added that the retention of theRoumanian army in the held gave the Austrians an excuse forresisting the German demands for the transfer of Austriantroops to other theatres of war.The War Cabinet decided that The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should communicate the view of the War Cabinet viz., thatwe should do all in our power to keep Roumania in thewar to the French Government, with a view to jointrepresentations being made to Roumania to this intent(Sir Edward Carson wished his dissent from thisdecision to be recorded, and expressed the view that the roumanians ought now to be allowed to make a separate peace.)Next Meeting of 18. Captain Amery reported that three important reports arethe Supreme War now being prepared by the Military Advisers to the Supreme WarCouncil. Council, namely (a.) The Turkish situation;(&amp;.) The Western front;(c.) The general military situation;would be ready by the end of that week.The Prime Minister pointed out that it would not be feasible to hold a meeting of the Supreme War Council until these reports had been received and considered by the War Cabinet. He there-fore proposed that the next meeting of the Supreme WarCouncil should not be held before Thursday week next, the 17thJanuary, 1918.This was agreed to.2.

APPENDIX.Paraphrase of Telegram No. 42 to Lord Bertie (Paris).Foreign Office, January 7, 1918, 7 rp.m.The following personal message from the Prime Minister to M. Clemenceau: I consider it advisable that the next meeting of the Supreme War council should be postponed until the further reports from the Permanent military advisers have been received and been considered by the several Governments. Thisshould not mean more than a week or ten days delay. At this moment I do not think there is any need for a discussion between the Allied Governments on the questionof the negotiations at Brest-Litovsk, though it may turn out that such a discussionwill be necessitated later.Practically all the outstanding questions turn on the decision to be taken onthe broad lines of our future military policy. I recognise that from the Frenchpoint of view one of the most urgent of these questions is that of the extension of theBritish line, and T understand that the Permanent Military Advisers are now con-sidering their report. The taking over of a portion of the French line already agreed to between General Petain and Field-Marshal Haig is about to commence;we should, in the meantime, ask the Permanent Military Advisers to hasten the com-pletion of their reports, both on the question of taking over the line and of thegeneral military policy.General Wilson has been communicated with in this sense. Instructions havebeen given to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris to send a copy of this telegram tothe British section at Versailles.o
