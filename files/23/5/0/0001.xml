Potato guarantees for 1918.1. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by LordEhondda (Paper G.T.-3155) in regard to the arrangements for the1918 potato crop in Great Britain.Lord Rhondda said that the scheme had been agreed to by theEnglish and Scottish Boards of Agriculture. It was proposed tomake a differentiation in price between England and Scotland,whereby the purchase prices in Scotland would be 10s. lower thanthose paid in England and Wales. The justification for the lowerprice in Scotland was partly on- account of the difficulty of trans-portation, which would now be undertaken by the Government;partly because it would be following the ordinary custom of thetrade; and partly because Scottish farmers got higher prices fortheir seed when they sold it, and also obtained the seed cheaper.In this matter of price the Scottish farmers who had been consultedwere satisfied.The War Cabidet decided that Lord Rhondda&apos;s scheme for potato guarantees should beadopted, and that an announcement should be made in thePress in accordance with his suggestion.British Mnsentn :Acquisition for AirMinistry.v5Minutek13,  Lord2. With reference to War Cabinet 30;&quot;Curzon drew attention to the decision, which had been reachedduring the absence of the Prime Minister, that the British Museumshould be taken over for occupation by the Air Ministry. He laid stress on the arguments against taking over the British Museum,and pointed out that a storm of criticism on the subject was beginning to arise.On the other hand, it was stated that there was no other suitable accommodation that could be obtained elsewhere for theAir Ministry.The Prime Minister undertook to see the First commissioner of Works, and, if there was any other suitable building-available, to raise the question for reconsideration.The Labour 3. With reference to War Cabinet 305, Minute 14, Sir AucklandSituation: Geddes called attention to the bad atmosphere that was existing in the 121 Per cent. connection with the 12^ per cent, increase. There was a generalBonus Dilemma.       demand that everyone must now have the same increase.Mr. Barnes said that in all parts of the country there were men, , fO in receipt of the increase who were working alongside others who/l^^ &apos; were not getting it.    The rest of the trades uuions were determined to secxire what the Amalgamated Society of Engineers had obtained.The President of the Board of Trade said that, in bis opinion,there were only two courses open to the Government: either to wait for strikes, which were sure to come, or to admit that a blunderhad been made and give way all along the line.The War Cabinet decided that &apos;A meeting should take place on the same day at 6-30 p.m. todiscuss this question of wages, when, in addition to themembers of the War Cabinet, the Minister of Munitions,the President of the Board of Trade, and the Minister of^/ National Service should also be present.Imports of Cotton 4. The  President of the Board of Trade, in reference to hisfOT 191S&apos; Memorandum on the Imports of Cotton for 1918 (Paper G.T.-3132),^ explained that on the 1st December, 1917, the Cabinet Committee6y on the Restriction of Imports had recommended that the imports ofScotton to be permitted in 3 918 should be increased by 50,000 tons$ ever the imports in 19] 7.    On the 5th December the War Cabinet
had decided (War Cabinet 292, Minute 14 (e)) that cotton imports during 1918 should not be increased until the question of usingcotton operatives and weaving sheds for aeroplane work had first been examined by the President of the Board of Trade in consultationwith the other Departments. In consequence of this decision, ameeting was held on the 7th December between representatives ofthe Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Munitions, the AeronatiealSupplies Department, and the Ministry of National Service, and inaccordance with the findings of this meeting the President: of thyBoaid of Trade recommended, for the sanction of the War Cabinet,that imports of cotton, on the basis  of an increase of 50,000 tons ascompared with 1917, should be allowed.The W&quot;ar Cabinet decided that The recommendations of the President of the Board of Trade,as set out in his Memorandum (Paper G-.T.-3132), shouldbe accepted.At a later stage, the Minister of Munitions urged that the above decision should be reconsidered, in view of the fact that every ton of imports taken up for food or cotton implied a ton taken off the munitions which vvould be available for the British armies. he pointed out that the engagements entered into in July 1917 betweenthe Ministry of Munitions and the A\rar Office, for the supply ofmunitions, had already been cut down and would be still furtherdangerously reduced if the proposed increase in the import of cottonwere to be carried out. While the ore available from Spain wasfalling short, the Minister of Munitions had been disappointed in hishopes of obtaining steel and nitrates from America, owing to reasons of exchange. In the British Isles we had, or should have in theimmediate future, the necessary plant for making all the shells andfuses promised, the necessarv labour, and would also have the guns to fire the shell and the personnel to man the guns. Mr. Churchillcould imagine nothing worse than that the Army should suffer from lack of munitions owing to the import of goods for the civil popula-tion. He considered that it would be better, -if it were foundnecessary, to support the cotton operatives who would be thrown out of work by lack of raw material by paying them the same wagefor shorter hours.The Prime Minister said that there was another alternative tocutting- down cotton, and that was to reduce the amount of barlevimported for brewing.The War Cabinet decided that Their previous decision, as above, should be adhered to, butthat the question of whether an equivalent reduction could be made in the amount of barley imported forbrewing should be referred to the Restriction of ImportsCommittee for report.Tin; Supreme War 5. The Prime Minister stated that he had been in communica-council, j-]on with M.   Clemenceau  relative to the next meeting of theSupreme War Council, and had expressed a wish that alternate-meetings should be held in Paris and London, with a view to themembers of the two Governments becoming better acquainted witin&quot;the Departmental policies which were being pursued. He hadreceived a letter from the President of the Council to the effectthat his health prevented his making the journey to London at thepresent time unless it were urgently necessary; that he wasperforming the double functions of President of the Council and minister of War, and suggesting that, as the Supreme War council with all its Stall&apos; was established at Versailles, it would be more advantageous that the meeting should be held at that place. . The
Prime Minister was of opinion that it was imperative that theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs should be present at the next meeting of the Supreme War Council, but that his health at thepresent moment would prevent him from crossing the Channel.The Prime Minister undertook to send a personal telegram toM. Clemenceau, again urging him to accede to his request to attend a meeting of the Council in London, basedprimarily on the grounds of the temporary indisposition ofthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Russia.6. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that,according to his information, the Germans in Petrograd bad obtainedcontrol of a direct wire between Petrograd and Berlin with a viewto the transmission of cypher messages.Salonica.7. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that information had been received from General Guillaumatthat he had found the British and Italian troops oil the Salonicafront well equipped, but that the contrary was the case as regardsthe French troops, and he was&quot; taking steps with a view to thenecessary improvement being made.Battle of Cambrai:I enquiry.Transfer of Gei manTroops.8. With reference to War Cabinet 305, Minute 7, the Secretaryof State for War informed the War Cabinet that he had just receivedfrom Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig a report on the operations inthe vicinity of Cambnii. He added that the report was very leno-thy,and undertook to circulate it as soon as possible.The War Cabinet requested Lord Derby to refer the report, in the first instance, to general smuts, in order that the latter might examine it before itwas presented to the War Cabinet.9. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that one- German division had been transferred from the Trentino to Alsace.10. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that general plumer had reported that the recent attack by the French had been extremely   well   carried   out.    It  had extended over a front of2,000 metres, and had resulted in the capture of 1,400 Austriany&quot; prisoners.Palestine. 11. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that General, t,/&apos; Allenby had reported having captured, in his recent action, 39 officers. &apos; and 711 other ranks, and having buried 1,00G enemy dead.   he added that, in his opinion, General Allenby&apos;s operations had beenbrilliantly carried out.The Invasion ofItaly. yLoss of Steamship 12. With reference to War Cabinet 308, Minute 6, the First Sea&quot; Arag-on.&quot; Lord informed the War Cabinet that information had been receivedf from Alexandria to the effect that 17 officers and 500 men had been3lost in the sinking of the transport &quot; Aragon,&quot; and that presumably/&quot;/v       the remainder, approximately 1,GOO, had been saved.    information had been received that all the women on board had been rescued.He added that 18 men were missing from the destroyer &quot; Attack.&quot;Admiral Wemyss pointed out that the approaches to AlexandriaS    were such that the laying of mines was far easier than sweeping.
Submarines.British submarines in the Baltic13. The First Sea Lord reported the following actions with enemy submarines : (a.) A ship was attacked by an enemy submarine in the vicinity of the Straits of Dover, and shortly afterwards a heavyexplosion took place, indicating that the submarine hadbeen destroyed in one of our mine-fields.(6.) One of our submarines had engaged two enemy submarines in the vicinity of Horns Reef, and had fired two torpedoesat one of the latter, an explosion being heard.14. With reference to War Cabinet 294, Minute 17, the first sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that the Admiralty had givendirections that Admiral Stanley was to leave Russia in company with the British Ambassador, and that they had issued orders thatCommander Crombie, in charge of the submarines, was to remain int/&quot; Russia for the present.Loan of Steamships&quot; Aquitania &quot; and&quot; Mauretania &quot; asTransports for american Troops.Future UseRussian Sriif ercauiileSillMarine.15. In reference to Paper G-T.-3158, the First Sea Lord statedthat the Americans had asked to have the use of the &apos;- Aquitania &quot;and &quot; Mauretania&quot; for the conveyance of troops to Europe. Theformer was at present fitted as a hospital ship and could carry4,000 troops; the latter was capable of carrying 3,700. AdmiralWemyss pointed out that the main difficulty as regards the employ-merit of these ships was that their use of Liverpool was restricted,owing to that port being required for the &quot; Olympic &quot; and &quot; Vater-land,&quot; and that they would therefore have to use Brest as the port of disembarkation, and Southampton as a port of coaling. He addedthat if the &quot;Aquitania &quot; was to be used for carrying troops, foreign government would have to be informed that she was nohospital ship.Toe War Cabinet decided that -longerThe matter should   be settled in consultation between theAdmiralty, the War Office, and tiie -Shipping Controller.16. In reference to a  Memorandum on  this subject by thehipping Controller (Paper G.T.-3110), Sir  Leo Chiozza Moneyasked for the decision of the War Cabinet as to the future employ-Russianmerit of Russian-owned  ships of the marine, the control of which had. up to recently, beenM ercantiltvested in ajoint Committee representing the Ministry of Shipping and the transportation Department of the Russian Government Committee.The Russian Committee had now been dismissed. The ships were at the present moment actually being employed by the BritishGovernment, and the questions to be settled were : (a.) Whether they were to be so employed in future.(6 ) To whom any payment for their use was to be made.The War Cabinet decided that The Ministry of Shipping should continue to make use of these ships until a question on the subject was raised by theRussian Government; and that, if necessary, force shouldbe used in dealing with the crews if any trouble arose withthe Russian sailors.The point as to payment was left open.17. In reference to a Memorandum by the Shipping controller the Russian (Paper G.T.-3143), Sir Leo Chiozza Money reported to the WarSteamer &quot; Czar.&quot;       Cabinet that the matter had been settled by the recalcitrant mengoing ashore.

The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byLord Curzon on the future of the German and Turkish territoriescaptured in the War (Paper G-182).The point was raised as to whether it would be advisable to convey a copy of this Memorandum to the President of the UnitedStates.The War Cabinet decided that -The matter should be brought up again during the following week, after the members had had time to study the subject.1 &apos;roj ioscdAppointment ofBritish commercial and FinancialKepresentativein Kussia.^    2.19. In reference to telegram b764, dated 26th December, 1917,from General Poole to Colonel Byrne (Paper G.T.-3127), Sir ArthurSteel Maitland explained that he gathered that General Poole was infavour of the appointment of a representative who could deal withfinance in relation to its bearing on commerce, rather than a financierpure and simple; further, that a financier of wide repute was notrequired, but one who was capable of diagnosing the situation and recommending to the British Government what steps were desirablewith a view to preventing the Germans acquiring control of Russiancommerce and supplies.The War Cabinet decided To approve General Pooles recommendation in principle, andthat the matter of details and the selection of the individualshould be carried out by the Foreign Office in conjunctionwith Sir Arthur Steel Maitland.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,January 1, 1918.o
