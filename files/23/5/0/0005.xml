Hankey, K.C.B., Secretary.War Aims :The Form of theAnnouncement.J031. With reference to War Cabinet 312, Minute 8, the WarCabinet continued their discussion on war aims. The first question discussed was the form which the statement shouldtake. It was generally agreed that, if the House of commons had been sitting, that would be the proper place for the PrimeMinister to make a statement. It was suggested, and generallyadmitted, that there would be some adverse criticism to a state-ment made to the trade unionists, as suggested at the morningmeeting, on the ground that it would give undue importance tothe trade unionists as compared with the other sections of thecommunity who were equally affected. On the other hand, itwas pointed out that no other convenient opportunity offereditself, and that it would be advisable to take advantage of it.On the whole, therefore, it was agreed that a statement to thetrade unionists was desirable. &apos;Communicationwith the Leader ofthe Opposition.2. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that before making a public declaration of the nature proposed, hehad thought it his duty to communicate with the Leader of theOpposition. He had seen Mr. Asquith that morning, and had explained the whole position to him, and had indicated thegeneral lines that the Government^ declaration was likely totake. Mr. Asquith had quite agreed that Count Czernin&apos;declaration ought to be treated seriously, and be given a con-si dered reply, and that a declaration should be made by theGovernment. He had seen the difficulties of issuing any soTt ofNote or statement, and though he had made some criticisms of
the proposal to make a public statement to the trade unionists,as had been urged at the War Cabinet, he had not opposed thiscourse. Mr. Asquith had also agreed in the general lines of thestatement it was proposed to make, though he had laid stress on theimportance of the exact phraseology.The Prime Minister said that, in seeing Mr. Asquith, follow-ing on his conversation with the Labour Leaders on the previous friday, he had aimed at securing national support in the action the War Cabinet proposed to take.*The Proposed 3. in regard to the text of the proposed statement, the WarStatement. Cabinet had before them three drafts, namely:-j, . (1.) Lord Robert Cecil&apos;s draft (G.T.-3181).j V^X (2.) General Smuts&apos; draft (G.T.-3180).-LCf^y- /3 (3.) Mr. Philip Kerrs draft summarising General Smuts&apos;(G.T.-3182).Lord Robert Cecil read his statement, which was discussed in some detail.The Secretary of State for the Colonies uttered a caveatagainst laying too much stress on the principle of self-determination-  .)ation. It was not his province to say what the effect would bein India or Egypt; but there were some of the Crown colonies which would certainly be affected; as one example, he mentionedCyprus, where an agitation has long been carried out for union with Greece, and where the Greek section of the inhabitants are mainly adherents to King Constantine. It was suggested thatthis difficulty -would be surmounted by confining the principle ofself-determination to the territories actually affected by the belligerent operations.The Prime Minister urged that the War Cabinet should notneglect to consider the drafts from the point of view of their value as a counter-offensive to the German peace move. He didnot in the least underrate the suggestion made by some Membersof the War Cabinet that the statement should be drawn up so asto be of real value in the ultimate peace negotiations. In hisopinion, however, the terms which we were bound to set out inthe document were not such as Germany could accept. Piereminded the War Cabinet that, at the moment, Germany was inthe hour&apos; of triumph, and this was the atmosphere of the German c1)i()people. In these conditions, no German Government could concedetill that we were bound to insist on. Hence, it was essential thatthis statement should be regarded rather as a war move than asa peace move. In this connection it was important to bear inmind its effects on Gerrnany&apos;s Allies. There would be a great difference between an Austria that desired to fight and one thatwas lukewarm. In the former case Austria might send 300,000men to the Western front. In the latter they would be a nominalarmy such as Russia had been for the last 18 months. similar considerations applied to Turkey. The publication by theBolsheviks of the Allied Treaties affecting Turkey had had agreat effect in that country. What kept the Turks fighting wasthe fear of dismemberment and of losing Constantinople. Ifthey knew that they would retain the Turkish part of their Empirethey might be much less inclined to fight.Lord Curzon suggested that it was undesirable to differentiate between the statement regarded as a peace or a war measure.   In* Note by the Secretary. It will be observed that by the presence of theSecretary of State for the Colonies, General Smuts, and Sir Edward Kemp. Imperialparticipation in the decision was secured so far as this was possible in the urgentcircumstances of the moment. See also the decision in War Cabinet 312, Minute 8,that the Secretary of State for the Colonies should communicate with the self-governing Dominions in regard to this statement.
reality it was both. It was a genuine and sincere attempt tosecure a reasonable peace, but he agreed that, in the present temperof the Germans, it was not likely to lead to much. Lord robert cecil expressed similar views.The suggestion was made that both Lord Robert cecils andGeneral Smuts&apos; statements were too long.Among the points of detail that were discussed, Lord robert cecil urged the importance of not using any phrases which would lead Roumania to think that we had in any way abandoned our obligations towards her. We had laid great stress on the sanctityof treaties, and we ought not to suggest in any statement that wewould not carry out a treaty until we had been released from our obligations by the nation concerned. Moreover, at the moment,Roumania was a very important factor in the war, being, indeed,the only barrier between the Germans and the great resources ofSouth Russia.Lord Robert Cecil also uttered a warning against any suggestion that we would not carry out our treaties to Italy.Signor Giolitti and his adherents were sedulously propagatingthe rumour that the British Government would not keep its obli-gations in Italy, and it was important not to encourage this idea.Another point of detail related to Montenegro, which it was generally agreed should be omitted from the statement, as thebest solution of the Montenegrin question might be its incorpora-tion in Serbia.Mr. Barnes, entering towards the end of the Meeting, gavesome account of the trade unionist meeting. After he himself had. promised a statement on war aims by the Prime Minister,Mr. J. H. Thomas had intervened and urged all the arguments against the proposal raised at the Cabinet in the morning. Inthe result Mr. Barnes had thought it advisable not to carry aresolution asking for a statement on war aims by the PrimeMinister, and the question had been left open.Further consideration was adjourned until the following day.2,Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,January 4, 1918.
