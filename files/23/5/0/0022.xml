i. THE War Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of the tonnage situation : (a.) Tonnage  for  cereals : Memorandum by  the Ministry ofShipping (Paper G.T.-3388).(p.) Tonnage for food: Memorandum by the Eood Controller(Paper G.T.-3415).(c.) Tonnage for nitrates: Memorandum by the Ministry ofMunitions (Paper G.T.-33i54).Lord Tthondda explained that, with regard to the import ofcereals, the -Shipping Controller was not fulfilling his authorisedprogramme, and that only by drastic cuts in the tonnage require-ments of the Ministry of Munitions could the necessary cereals beobtained.It was pointed out that the cutting down by the War Office ofthe oat ration to the army (War Cabinet 329, Minute 6) shouldrelieve the situation to a considerable extent, which would beincreased if the War Office were to reduce the oat ration to 9 lbs.,and not 10 lbs. as proposed.Sir Leo Money pointed out that this would not affect theshipping position in February and March, and little relief could beexpected before May from the reduction of the oat ration.Sir John Beale stated that on the 1st February there would be only twelve weeks&apos; supply of cereals in the country, six weeks of thissupply being on the farms, and that on 1st May he did not anticipatehaving in hand more than a four weeks&apos; supply apart from that onthe farms. This,in his opinion, was not a sufficient margin of safety.With regard to oats, there was no reserve at all for civilian purposes,but only enough for the supply to the army.Sir Leo Money drew attention to p. 4 of Paper G.T.-3388,which showed that there would be a cereal shortage of 179,000 tonsin the month of February alone, and asked for the War Cahinefsapproval of the proposals made in the paper to give priority to food.Mr. Churchill then drew attention to the position of theMinistry of Munitions in regard to this question, and stated that itwas becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the supply ofmunitions to the army owing to the fact that priority of tonnagewas now being given to food and to the demands of the Admiralty.He would very much like to know whether the cutting down of thetonnage allotted to munitions was to be temporary or permanent, andhe thought the War Cabinet should realise that, although hisdemands had been cut down to a certain figure, he had received in reality little more than half of that figure. He was working on thebasis of a maximum production, and he would like the War Cabinetto be quite clear on this point.Lord Derby supported the view expressed by Mr. Churchill.Sir Leo Money said, in reply to Mr. Churchill, that, as theCabinet had been already informed, a general tonnage deficit oflarge dimensions would obtain in each month of the year.The Prime Minister said that the great factor of the war thisyear would be either military or moral, and, as far as he could see atpresent, be was inclined to think it would be the latter. Food was our first line of defence. Labour was already inclined to demand the cessation of hostilities, and the food position, unless improved, wouldaggravate this demand. It would be impossible to let the nationdown over food. He did not mean by this that the output ofmunitions should be dangerously reduced. There was a minimumbelow which it was impossible to go. The tonnage question they hadto face was one which had both a temporary and a permanent aspectas regarded deficiency. With regard to supplying tonnage to our allies, the Prime Minister thought that we should make a certainallotment to each Ally, and then leave the Ally to decide whichcommodity should have priority..
Mr. Long, while making reservation as to his powers of con-trolling oil tonnage, to which Lord Bhondda had agreed, in theMemorandum, called attention to the transport difficulties in theUnited States of America. Steamers had been kept waiting in american ports for cargoes of wheat which could not be brought up from the Middle West to the quayside. He suggested that theUnited States Government should be asked to give priority for transport of foodstuffs over the railways. Lie then made some sug-suggestions for relieving the food situation in this country. He thoughtthat the inequality of distribution was the cause of a good deal ofdissatisfaction, and that if there were an improvement in the internaltransport of the country this dissatisfaction might, at any rate, belessened. Also there was a good deal to be said for the idea of getting people, whose presence was not absolutely necessary in towns,to live in the country. There was no doubt that the food supply inthe country was better than in the towns.Lord Rhondda stated that while he appreciated the action takenby the Ministry of Shipping to give effect to the priority of food laiddown by the Cabinet, this action (as set out in the Ministry ofShipping Memorandum) did not fully meet his requirements, and, inparticular, did not provide for the purchase of the additional baconplaced at the disposal of the Ministry of Food by Mr. Hoover.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Restriction of Imports Committee should reassembleand investigate the whole position regarding the differentclaims of the Food Controller, the Minister of Munitions,and other Departments.(6.) The requirements of the Admiralty should be gone intoseparately by a body7 to be determined, in order to see ifit were possible to effect a reduction in their demands upon the Ministry&apos; of Munitions.(c.) The proposals contained in Paper G.T.-3388 were approved.representation of 2. With reference to War Cabinet 240, Minute 9, a short pre-the People Bill.        liminary discussion took place upon the situation that had been^p, &apos;     created in Parliament by the adoption of Lord Selborne&apos;s amendment[y/b in favour of proportional representation bv a majority of 90 in thefl/js House of Lords.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that, as the result of consultation with the Home Secretary, he had formed the view that,if proportional representation were introduced into the Bill, it wouldnot be possible to pass it during this Session, as the Boundary Com-missioners would be required .to recommence their investigations,which would take many weeks. He thought the House of commons would reject most emphatically the proposal put forward by lord balfour of Burleigh that the franchise and the registration portions of the Bill should be passed into law while the clauses dealing withredistribution should be incorporated in a separate Bill to be passed in the next Session. In his opinion, the House of Commons wouldreject the Lords&apos; amendments dealing with proportional representa-tiou by even bigger majorities than when the subject was debated inthe Lower Chamber. He thought that a possible line of compromisewould be found in the acceptance of the Lords&apos; amendments dealingwith the alternative vote.Lord Curzun expressed the view that little would be gained bya discussion until it was known definitely what line the majority ofthe House of Commons would take.Lord Robert Cecil expressed the hope that, whatever happened,the Government Whips would not be put on in the Plouse of Com-mons against proportional representation.
Allies&apos; Intentions 3. The Prime Minister called the attention of the War cabinet for Arab Countries, to a telegram from Sir Reginald Wingate (No. 154 of the 22ndJanuary, 1918), in which Sir Reginald Wingate said that, in the***- - present critical state of Arab feeling, he was convinced that vague orgenera] assurances about the future of the Arabs are not onlyineffectual but harmful, and that explicit denials of enemy assertionsare necessary in order to restore confidence in the Entente&apos;8 goodintentions, lie asked if he might be authorised to notify King Hus-sein officially as follows  1. That His Majesty&apos;s Government is still determined to secureArab independence and to fulfil the promise made through him at the beginning of the Hejaz revolt.2. That His Majesty&apos;s Government will countenance no permanent foreign or European occupation of Palestine,Irak (except the province of Basrah), or Syria after thewar.3. That these districts will be in possession of their natives, andthat foreign interference with Arab countries will be restricted to assistance and protection.Lord Curzon said that the Middle-East Committee met everySaturday to consider questions relating to that part of the world.Lord Curzon undertook to bring Sir Reginald Wingate&apos;telegram before the Committee for examination at their next meeting.The &quot;Goeben.&quot; 4. With reference to War Cabinet 329, Minute 11, the first sea Lord had nothing new7 to add to the previous reports in regardj *minister/ to the bombing attacks on the &quot; Goeben.&quot;./b-  /a . In connection with the possibility (if hitting the &quot; Goeben &quot; by&quot; indirect fire over the Galiipoli Peninsula, the First. Sea Lord saidthat this question had been studied at the Admiralty, but, in viewof the fact that our ships would have to anchor in mine-fields off the peninsula and be exposed both to enemy submarines and also toTurkish gunfire from the shore, the operation had not beent/ considered practicable.Promotion in the 5. It was generally felt by members of the War Cabinet that ai Army. good deal of public anxiety was being aroused on the subject of the promotion to higher ranks in the Army of ofiicers who had enteredmilitary service for the first time since August 1914. there appeared to be a general feeling that undue bias was given in favourof the selection for the higher commands and Staff to officers of theold Regular Army. Criticism came more particularly from the universities, which had supplied some of the most capable and activebrains in the country, whose services were not being utilised to thebest advantage of the nation and the Army. It was understoodthat the President of the Beard of Education had strong views upon this subject.Lord Milner stated that he was informed that only three officers who had had no previous military experience before the war had reached the rank of Brigadier-General, and none had reached the rank of Major-General.Lord Derby stated that it was extremely difficult to obtainaccurate statistics upon this point, but that he was sympathetic tothe policy of making the best use of civilian intelligence in the Army.Experience showed that only regular soldiers with long militaryexperience were able to deal with an emergency problem such as had arisen at Cambrai.   He informed the Cabinet that he had to make
a speech upon the subject of War Office administration on thefollowing Tuesday, in which he hoped to deal with this question.Lord Derby said that he would be prepared to give the WarCabinet the substance of what he intended to say on Monday.6. The War Cabinet resumed the general discussion on our policy in regard to Prussia upon the lines dealt with in WarCabinet 327.Mr. Balfour recapitulated the statement of our policy which hethen made, adding that a telegram had been sent to Mr. Lindley at petrograd, informing him that His Majesty&apos;s Government left it tohis discretion as to when he and his staff should leave Petrogradshould an emergency arise.Lord Robert Cecil stated that, while he fully concurred in thepresent policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, he thought that thequestion should be more fully considered, in view of the strong representations made by General Knox that the effect of ourmaintaining even informal relations with the Bolsheviks tended to discourage friendly elements in South Russia.The War Cabinet adjourned the discussion of this subject to aspecial meeting of the War Cabinet to be held in theChancellor of the Exchequers Room at the House ofCommons at 6 p.m. that evening.2, WJiitehall Gardens, S.W.,January 24, 1918.o
