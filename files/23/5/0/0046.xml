With reference to War Cabinet 350, Minute 5, in reply to aAttack. i    -   question as to the position of the Belgian army, the Director of/    Military Intelligence stated that the inundations on the FlandersAs^ front were still full.^ a/-&quot;&quot; y v The Director of Military Intelligence stated that, while there^ was little doubt that the enemy intended to make a great attack indue course, there was no sign of its immediate commencement. by 1st March the German cadres would be full, and an attack might come any time after that. There were at present no signs of animpending attack on the Flanders front. There were some prepara-tions, mainly defensive, on the front from La Bassee to Arras, andy definite signs of offensive preparations on the front Arras-St. Quentin.3. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that theBritish military attache at Petrograd had endeavoured to persuade the Sailors&apos; Committees at, Reval to destroy the stores there.Information had been received that a quantity of stores had been evacuated before the arrival of the Germans. The advance of theGermans in North Russia was being made by very small forces. Intelegrams received at the end of the previous week it was statedthat M. Trotsky had talked of the possibility of guerilla warfarey taking place.Trans-Caucasia. 4. The Director of Military Intelligence stated that a good dealof information was coming to hand about the Russian withdrawal in turkish Armenia. The Russian troops were completely demoralised,and bands of armed Armenians were committing all sorts of excesses.The Russians intended to evacuate Erzeroum.The Director of Military Intelligence, who had been intelephonic communication with the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff, raised the question of the policy to be adopted in Persia, inview of General Dunsterviile&apos;s enforced withdrawal from Trans-Caucasia, where he was to have done what he could to organise theforces favourable to the Allies in that region. General Wilson had suggested that the best course was to instruct General Dunstervilleto endeavour to organise levies in the Kermanshah area, and tosupport him by means of cavalry and armoured cars, sent up byGeneral Marshall from Kasr-i-Shirin as soon as the snow melted. Itwas most important to secure the safety of the roads leading from mesopotamia through Kermanshah to Teheran and to the CaspianSea. The matter had been discussed on the previous day by thePersian Committee, and the War Office had been asked to report onthe military aspect of the situation.The Cabinet were informed that the Persian Committee had also authorised a telegram to be sent to Sir C. Marling, asking hisopinion on the War Office proposals. Hitherto His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had tried to conciliate the democratic elements in persia, and had been giving them substantial financial assistance.In order to keep in touch with these elements, we had been preparedto withdraw our troops, and to make other concessions in return fora quid pro quo. Sir C. Marling had urged a military occupation of north-West Persia against Tartars, Bolsheviks, t and PersianExtremists. The Persian Committee had deprecated such action,and had suggested alternatives, which, so far, had come to nothing.The War Office were pressing for military action, but, as this wouldJRussia.
be tantamount to declaring war on Persia, it was necessary that thematter should be examined from every side.The Director of Military Intelligence said that the matter wasone of considerable urgency, as disorder was spreading from the caspian along the road to Kasr-i-Shirin.The War Cabinet decided To refer the matter to the Persian Committee, which should be summoned immediately a reply had been received fromSir C. Marling to the telegram agreed to by the Committeey on the previous day.Submarines. 5. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that reports had beenreceived that the destroyer &quot; Onslow &quot; had dropped charges on anenemy submarine, which came to the surface vertically and divedstern first; and that His Majesty&apos;s ship &quot; Montbretia &quot; had droppeda depth charge on an enemy submarine 5 miles south of the entrance-/   to Milford HaremRussia:japanese intervention.A6. With reference to War Cabinet 353, Minute 12, the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs stated that the Prime Minister had approved the telegram which he had drafted, and a copy had beensent to Tokio for the information of Sir C. Greene, but that he(Mr. Balfour) would not approach the Japanese Ambassador untilthe view of the American Government had been obtained.Reconstruction 7. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda dealing withFinance. Reconstruction Finance by Dr. Addison (Paper G.T -3643), Sir A.Mond (Paper G.T.-36S1), and Air. G. H. Roberts (Paper G.T.-3735).^       The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to see the Ministery of Reconstruction on the points raised in these Memoranda.Sinn Fein S. With reference to War Cabinet 353, Minute 13, the WarLawlessness in Cabinet gave further consideration to the pioposals contained in the Ireland. Chief gecretary&apos;s telegram (Paper G.T.-3720) for dealing with SinnFein agitators convicted for various offences against the law-.The Home Secretary stated that there was a legal difficulty in^ carrying   out   the   Chief   Secretary&apos;s  second  proposal, viz., thes     internment of certain Sinn Fein leaders, aa. in order to intern^ i y       British subjects, it was necessary to prove legally hostile association.5.    It was more than doubtful whether connection with the Dublinrebellion  of   191(i   could   still   be   legally  regarded  as   hostileassociation.The Attorney-General concurred in this view.The Home Secretary stated that, under the Defence of the realm Act, the military authorities had the power to restrict the movements of undesirables and to confine them to residence in acertain specified area. As regards the establishment of a permitsystem between Great Britain and Ireland, he was advised such asystem was quite practicable, if considered necessary. In this caseRegulation 14 G would have to be amended by omitting the words(previously inserted at the request of the Irish Government) &quot; or aBritish subject proceeding from one port in the United Kingdom toanother.&quot; Further, it would be necessary to establish a PermitOffice at Glasgow, and strengthen the one at Liverpool. AdditionalAliens Officers would be required at Fishguard, Fleetwood, andArdrossan. The Irish Government would have to arrange some system of permits from Ireland.
qoSupply of doctors for theArmy.On the other hand, it was pointed out to the Cabinet that theproposed system would cause a good deal of inconvenience to theordinary passengers to and from Ireland.Mr. Long thought that, under the general circumstances nowobtaining in Ireland, such objection should not be allowed to stand.He welcomed the proposal of the Chief Secretary to take action inthis matter.The War Cabinet approved the proposal of the Chief secretary that orders lor removal from Ireland should be made effective in England by action of the military authorities,who would in all cases be advised by him : as regards theproposed internment in England of Irish undesirables, they decided that action should not be taken except in caseswhere hostile association could be definitely proved: asregards the proposed permit or passport system, the WarCabinet desired the Chief Secretary to consider thequestion of establishing machinery in Ireland, and requested his reasons for the proposal, and a statement asto whether, on a review of all aspects of the question, hedefinitely recommended it, and instructed the Secretary tocommunicate with Mr. Duke accordingly.9. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of National Service (Paper G.T.-3670).In the absence of Sir Auckland Geddes, it was agreed that theWar Office, and the Ministry of National Service, in consultationwith the President of the Local Government Board, should confer on the subject, with a view to reaching an agreement, and that onlyfailing agreement should the question again be brought before theWar Cabinet.Draft Bill toAmend the LawConcerning the qualifications ofDeputyLieutenants.10, Lord Derby requested the approval of the War Cabinet toa Draft Bill, already circulated (Paper G-.T.-3562), to amend thelaw concerning the qualifications of Deputy Lieutenants.The War Cabinet sanctioned the introduction of the Bill.(Initialled)A.
