Transfer of EnemyDivisions.JJlVIS]1. WITH reference to War Cabinet 320, Minute 2, the Chief ofthe ^Imperial General Staff reported that the number of german divisions on the Western front had risen to 163 certain, and 165S probable.Allied and Enemy-Strength on theWestern Front.2. The question was once more raised as to whether everything possible was being done by the Allies to meet the enemy&apos;s concen-tration on the Western front.It was pointed out that the Allies still possessed a considerablenumerical superiority, and that everything was being done, by meansof drafts, to bring up to establishment the British divisions now in*/ France.Russia.3. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to telegramNo. 20 from Odessa, dated the 12th January, 1918, indicating a deterioration in the situation in South Russia, and that Bolshevik\/ influences were gaining ground in the Ukraine.Loss of Destroyers 4. The First Sea Lord stated that bad weather was taking a&quot; Opal&quot; and ^ heavy toll of our warships.   Two destroyers, the &quot;Opal&quot; and the&quot; Narbprough^; &quot; Narborough,&quot; had been lost near the Pentland Firth, and so far&apos;^r-^&apos; y no trace of them had been found.Increase in 5. The First Sea Lord stated, in answer to a question, that heProduction of saw no hope at present of an increase in the rate of production of destroyers. destroyers, but that new ones were being put into commission at the* rate of&apos; about six per month.SubmarineG-8.1-&quot; 6.

The First Sea Lord confirmed the rumour that some weeks ago a pilot ship, with twenty pilots on board, had been sunk in they Mersey by a German submarine.War priorities committee:Press.Announcement.8. The Secretary obtained the sanction of the Prime Minister to publish in the press an announcement regarding the War Prioritiesy Committee, which had received the approval of General Smuts.Co-operation of theUnited States ofAmerica.Or/// 3 sfe9. With reference to War Cabinet 319, Minute 3, the WarCabinet bad before them a memorandum by the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff i Paper G.T.-3327) regarding his recent interview inFrance with General Pershing on the subject of the suggested useof American battalions with British divisions.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that the Shipping-Controller had accompanied him to France, and that he had definitelyascertained that the best use was not now being made by the americans of French ports. He instanced the fact that some of theships sent to Brest were not suitably loaded. An American shipping-expert was coming to London that day to go into the various problems with the Ministry of Shipping. He added that we could make arrangements for the landing of some American troops at South-ampton, and for the transportation of these troops across the channelin smaller vessels.    The question of Admiralty escorts for this
purpose, however, presented serious difficulty. He admitted thathis report presented a somewhat gloomy account of the present state of tilings, hut feared it was accurate. General Pershing was over-worked, and responsibility of a political character was beingthrown on. to him by the President, by leaving the question of american incorporation in British divisions to him. He was glad to report that both M. Olemencesu and General Petain took areasonable and helpful line. M. Clemenceau realised the languagedifficulty in incorporating American battalions in the French Army.Pie gathered that M. Clernenceau would welcome our suggestion,provided it led to an increase in -the amount of American assistancerendered available on the Western front.Mr. Balfour reported a private conversation he had had with admiral Sims, who shared the view taken by the British authorities.He added that lie was of opinion that it was most important to getAmerican troops sent to British ports, and so to France.Lord Reading stated rbat he had received a letter written byMr. Mackay, giving an even gloomier statement, with regard to theprospects of American shipbuilding, than that submitted by our representative, Sir Thomas Royden. The difficulty appeared to bethat there was no system of delegating authority at Washington,and everything had to be referred to the White House for decision.Ex-President Roosevelt was daily attacking the Government fortheir delays in settling vital matters. In regard to the &quot; Liberty &quot;engine for aeroplanes, tests already made before Lord Reading leftAmerica were favourable, but these were not so severe as thosepractised in our service.General Smuts pointed out that the only satisfactory testwould be a long-distance flight. With regard to the incorporation of American troops in British divisions, he thought that thePresident desired to be fortified, in making Ins decision, by a recommendation from his Military Advisers.Lord Robert Cecil added that it was impossible to over-estimate the harm done in America by Lord Northcliffe&apos;s letter, which drewan unfavourable and inaccurate contrast between American powersof organisation and British.Lord Derby stated that if American troops could be sent to thiscountry, it would be possible for us to clothe, equip, and arm at least150,000.Lord Reading added that sooner or later he thought that president Wilson must be guided bv the English view. Thedifficulty was that every American Mission sent to this countrybecame very strongly anglicised. Admiral Sims was an instance in point. The President still hesitated to submit their advice to theAmerican public, as American sentiment was so strongly in favour of separate national organisation.The War Cabinet decided that The Prime Minister should send a personal message to thePresident, through Colonel House, again urging our pro-posais regarding the suggested incorporation of american troops in British divisions, the Chief of the imperial GeneralStaff to provide the Prime Minister with the necessary material for the telegram.10. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the WarCabinet that a private message having been received to the effectthat President Wilson would welcome some expression of approvalfrom the Prime Minister on his recent declaration to Congress, hehad sent, with the Prime Ministers approval, a telegram eongratu-lating President Wilson on the beneficent effect which his speech had produced throughout the world.
AmericanRepresentation inEurope.11. The Secretary of State for War brought before the WarCabinet the desirability of more effective representation of the UnitedStates of America in Europe. At present none of the representativesof the United States in Europe could decide anything without reference to Washington, nor could they be relied upon to carryweight at Washington.Lord Reading was urged to do what he could in the UnitedStates of America to carry this suggestion into effect.NationalRegistrationAmendment Bill.12. The War Cabinet had before them a Draft Bill entitledNational Registration Amendment Bill (Paper G.T.-3318).Mr. Hayes Fisher explained that the objects of the RegistrationBill were to secure the registration of boys who were not nowregistered. Many boys now reaching the age of 17 were notregistered, and it was essential, for the continuance of recruiting,that this step should be taken. The only proposal in the Billregarding which he felt considerable doubt was that contained in clause 5, namely, the compulsory registration of Irishmen arriving in Great Britain from Ireland. He feared that this proposal mightarouse suspicion that conscription was about to be applied to Ireland,and the sole result would be that a number of Irishmen wouldprobably refrain from coming to this country to take part in civiloccupations.Sir Auckland Geddes added that, although it was most desirablefrom the point of view of the knowledge of his Department con-cerning the available pools of civil labour, be agreed that any step which prevented Irishmen coming to this country to take part insuch industries as agriculture would be unfortunate.The Secretary for Scotland stated that the effect of the clausewould be to frighten away Irish labourers engaged in agriculture inScotland and to prevent others from coming to that country a most fortunate result.The War Cabinet approved the draft Bill, with the exception ofthe part of sub-section 2 of clause 5 dealing with Irishimmigrants, which should be deleted.Military service bill.y18. The War Cabinet had before them a draft Bill amending theMilitary Service Acts (G.T.-3304). The Secretary for Scotlanddrew attention to clause 2, sub-section 2, which gave the power tothe Minister of National Service to override other Ministers in regardto the withdrawal of men in their department for military service.It was pointed out, however, that Ministers were often placed ina difficult position in regard to the selection of men, in their service,for military service, and that it would be desirable that this discre-tion should be vested in some other Minister.The War Cabinet approved the draft Bill.The IrishConvention.14. The War Cabinet held a short preliminary discussionregarding the present situation in the Irish Convention.It was pointed out that an important meeting of the convention was to take place on the following day, and it was agreed that theposition reached should not be discussed in detail until the results ofthis meeting were known.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,January 14, 1918.
