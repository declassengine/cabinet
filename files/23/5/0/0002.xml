Ormsby-Gore, M.P., Assistant Secretary.The labour situation:The 12J Per ceut-dilemma.3 ^THE War Cabinet continued the discussion begun at WarCabinet 309, Minute 3.Mr. Barnes stated that the Cabinet Labour Committee had met at 3 p.m. that afternoon, and had endeavoured to unravel the difficultyoccasioned by the 12-J- per cent, increase to certain time-workers.The usual telegrams had been received regarding threatened stoppagesof work. Several strikes had actually commenced : bricklayers were out in Glasgow, and steel-smelters were not lighting up the furnaces,and so resumption of work after the holidays would be delayed. Thenumber of applications received by the Committee for consideration was so great that it was impossible for them to go on dealing withthe questions at issue in the same way as they had been attempting to do in the last few days. On the other hand, he was of opinionthat it was quite impossible to deal with the cases in bulk; each
trade would have to be considered by itself. Hitherto the Committeehad kept clear of any piece-work applications. The only caseaffecting piece-workers that had been approached was that of the belfast shipyard workers, to whom an increase had been given by theCommittee on Production. This case was up for re-hearing this week.It was a somewhat special case, owing to the fact that many of the belfast men were only working three days aweek becauseof the shortageof material. The Labour Committee recommended that the cabinet should issue a declaration, to be made on behalf of the Government.The War Cabinet Labour Committee found that there was no logicalstopping-place for the extension of the 12-J- per cent, bonus by theinclusion of all munition workers, but this fact could not be put in adeclaration. They thought that discretion might be left to negotiations within the limit of all munition workers as ordinarilyunderstood. Other kinds of workers must negotiate advances in wages, including the extension of the 12-J per cent, bonus, in theusual way through their employers or through an agreement withthe Ministry of Labour. It was quite impossible to extend wagesadvances over the whole country without examination into eachseparate case. Mr. Barnes felt that the whole labour world was onedge in regard to the question, and he read a letter from the Presidentof the Board of Education regarding the position at Sheffield, which showed that the most fantastic notions were being circulated by asmall knot of revolutionaries. For instance, it was being said thatthe situation had been engineered by the Government for the purposeof creating a revolution in order that the Government might shootdown the revolutionaries. Mr. Barnes then read to the Cabinet two alternative drafts, which should form the basis of the Governmentsdeclaration. One had been drawn up by himself (Appendix), and theother by Sir Auckland Geddes. The main difference between thetwo consisted in the inclusion, in Sir Auckland Geddes&apos;s proposed declaration, of a definite assurance to be given by the Governmentthat they would take the whole of the excess profits, instead oi ordy80 per cent, as at present.The Prime Minister stated that he had seen Mr. GeorgeTerrell, M.P., who represented a certain Federation of Employers.The suggestion put to him by the latter was that, before deciding thequestion, which affected all the employers of the country, it was absolutely essential that the employers should be heard and consulted.The Government had to consider what would be the effect of theproposed declaration upon the working of the whole industrialmachine of the country. He gathered that the case of the employerscould be summarised as follows : (a.) There were numerous cases where little or no profit wasbeing made by employers before the War, and that the taking of the whole of the excess profits would consequently act most unfairly between employers whosebusiness was flourishing before the War and those whosebusiness was not then flourishing ;(b.) Many of the employees were earning four or five times thewages that they were making before the War, these increases in wages being far in advance of any increasecorresponding to the rise in the cost of living.It would be quite impossible for the Government to include .astatement that they would take the whole of the excess profitswithont hearing the views of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, whowas absent in Paris. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had strongviews upon this question, and he gathered that the latter&apos;s opinion was that, if all the excess profits were taken, nothing wotdd be leftto the employers of this country for the purpose of developing and extending their business. The Prime Minister added that he had promised to see some of Mr. Terrell&apos;s people on the following day.
3WG 310Siv Albert Stanley stated that, in his opinion, it was both just and necessary that the employers should be consulted before any declaration, such as was proposed, was made by the Government.Mr. George Terrelfs organisation did not represent ad the employers of the. country, and he suggested that a selected list of representativeemployers should be drawn up by the Board of Trade, and that theyshould be interviewed by the Cabinet, if possible, this week.Sir Auckland Geddes stated that the sentiment regarding excessprofits now prevailing among the wage-earners of the country wasprofound, and vitally affected the reception that would be given tothe Government proposals regarding man-power and recruiting.Mr. Churchill stated that, in his opinion, it was just and right thatthe whole of the excess profits should be taken, but he quite agreedthat the employers should he seen first, and that the question shouldnot be settled without a clear understanding with the employers.The policy of the War Cabinet Labour Committee laid down thatthe Ministry of Munitions should have power to extend the 1-4 percent, bonus or its equivalent over the whole of the munitions industryin cases where the Ministry of Munitions considered that such anextension should be made. As regards time-workers, two-thirds ofthe area concerned had already been covered, and an extension to theremaining one-third would involve the State in a further expendi-ture of about 8,000,0&apos;JOZ. a year. As regards piece-workers, he understood that the Trades Union leaders agreed that no wideextension of the 12A per cent, bonus or its equivalent was desirable or necessary. The piece workers would have to be dealt with byadjusted piece-rates in each trade separately, where the rates were so low as to be no longer an inducement. The Trades UnionAdvisory Committee were of opinion that employers should settle theterms with their piece-workers while the Ministry only dealt withtime-workers. There were forty strikes threatening, but in nearly every one of these cases the classes affected would obtain the advanceunder the proposed extension. He felt that the problem of thep&apos;ece-workers could be left to work automatically, in many casesthe piece-work earnings were so high that there \va* little or no riskof a strike, as the piece-workers, by going out for two weeks, would lose more money than they could hope to gain by any advance for along period.Sir Albert Stanley pointed out that there was considerabledanger that the demand would spread fr. m the munition workers tothe mines and railways, particularly the latter. It was impossibleto prevent the railwaymen in the shops making a demand for the1-1- per cent, increase, as the men engaged in munition work in railway workshops could not be treated differently from munition workers, and once any man in the railway workshops was given the121- per cent, increase all the others would press for a similarincrease.Mr. Barnes pointed out that the only shops touched at presentwere the Great Central Railway shops at Gorton.Mr. Churchill urged that any consideration of the wages of railwaymen should be treated as part of a special railway agreement.The only hope was the establishment of a ring of separate trade agreements.Sir Albert Stanley stated that Mr. J. H. Thomas, M.P., was opposed to the extension of the 12^- per cent, to the railway workshops.In this connection Sir David Shackleton pointed out that therailway shops were only partially controlled by Mr. J. H. Thomas&apos;union ; the craft unions had a considerable membership.Sir Auckland Geddes stated that the position as regards railway-men had already been turned on another flank, namely, by theNational Maritime Boards, of which Sir Leo Chiozza Money isChairman, somewhat   sudden   grant of an increase in the wages
ot seamen on railway boats. The difficulty appeared to be that,unless some stand were taken, the demands would extend by similarmethods from one industry to another, until every kind of extraneoustrade was included.The Prime Minister stated that, as far as he could see, it waBnow impossible to stop. We were not in a position to face a seriousstrike, as there was no logical ground upon which to take the strike.Mr. Roberts agreed with this view, and stated that the question had become psychological. The wage-earners of all kinds had gotthis question into their heads, and there was no stopping it.Sir Edward Carson added that it appeared like a flame in aforest, which would extend until the whole forest was consumed, and involve the State in an expenditure of countless millions.Sir David Shackleton pointed out that, owing to the presentsituation, a nest of trouble was being created in every industry. Amunicipal employer had pointed out to him that many different ratesof wages were being paid in their works at the present moment.Some men had got 12s. advance, others lGs., others 20s., some hadalready got the 12-^ per cent, advance, while others had not. the belfast employers and employed were combining to exploit the public by agreeing, without any consultation with the Government, to large increases in wages, but the Committee on Production had refused to sanction the agreement.Sir Alan Anderson stated that the shipbuilding employers had informed him that, in their opinion, the 12\ per cent, increase wouldhave to go round all time-workers in the shipyards, and that con-cessions would then have to be made to men paid by results. Theonly way in which the Government could get anything back wouldbe to increase and extend the principle of payment by results. Hewould like to see an extension of the principle of premium bonus.In this connection Mr. Roberts stated that it would beimpossible to bribe the men to agree to an extension of the systemof premium bonus.Sir David Shackleton added that the 12  per cent, increase-had done more to kill the premium bonus principle than anything else in the last ten years. It was quite impossible now to get themen to withdraw their opposition to the system of payment byresult. They considered the refusal to extend the 121- per cent, topiece-workers and premium-bonus workers a penalty on higher wagesdue to increased effort.The W^ar Cabinet decided (a.) That, before taking any final decision, the views of repre-sentative employers should be heard.Sir Albert Stanley undertook to assemble a suitabledeputation to wait upon the Prime Minister on Thursdayor Friday afternoon next.(o.) Meanwhile the Minister of Munitions to have authorityto negotiate within the general area of munitions trades,with a view to defining, both by extension and inter-pretation, She scope of the existing Orders, with powerto include any such trades, provided always that theextension was limited to time-workers.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,January 2, 1918.
APPENDIX.Draft Statement by the Right Hon. G. N. Barnes, M.P.THE Government find it necessaiy to place certain facts before the nation. the collapse of Russia and the weakening of Italy has thrown upon us a great strain and agreat duty. It is therefore no time for wage scrambling or profiteering. The Govern-ment has come to the conclusion that neither one nor the other can continue. Theidea that any class has a right to make money out of the nation&apos;s needs must becombated wherever it appears. If it be found that the Government have not sufficientpower to see to this without additional legislation, then that legislation will be sought.The Government are doing all in their power to deal with the food situation. a determined effort is being made to abolish the food queues. The Local Committees arebeing armed with additional powers, and are being encouraged to use those powers tothe fullest extent so as to distribute food on the basis of share and share alike.Advance of wages have recently been given by the Government to certain sectionsof workmen in the engineering and shipbuilding trades. These advances arose out ofan honest intention to remedy an admitted anomaly. In practice it has been found impossible to keep them within the original limits, and this has led to much agitationand trouble. It is imperative now, however, to come to a stop. Limits must be set tothe area within which those wage advances can be paid. There are certain outstandingnegotiations taking place as between the Minister of Munitions and the workpeopleconcerned. The Minister has therefore been directed to convene trades&apos; conferences incertain cases in order to ascertain whether and to what extent any consequential change is called for.Beyond this, advances of wages can only be negotiated in the usual way on proof of increased cost of living, or in the form of paj-ment by results, or for some very exceptional cause. The best way in which the mass of the British people can be helpedthrough the present grave period in our national fortunes is, not by raising wages all round,but by keeping down the cost of living by every means in human power, and bypreventing any class or section making money out of the war. It is to that the efforts of the Government in the new year will be constantly directed.
