German &quot; Tanks.1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff drew the attentionof the War Cabinet to a report that tanks were being built by theGermans. He mentioned a statement that 500 had been orderedin Switzerland by the German Government.Possible german attack on theWestern Front.2. With reference to War Cabinet 3-10, Minute 3, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff read a report from. Field-Marshal sir douglas Haig relating to the part of the line held by the Portuguese,and to the measures taken by him to ensure its safety.British Divisions 5. With reference to War Cabinet 345, Minute i, the Chief of theon the Italian Imperial General Staff read an urgent message he had received from-Front- General Foch, pointing out that, by a comparison of the opposing., ,      - forces on the Western and Italian fronts, the enemy possessed a;   &apos; * superiority of force on the former, and the Allies on the latter front;expressing his opinion that, it was essential that part of the allied forces now in Italy should, without delay, be brought back to theWestern front ; and suggesting that, as the British reserves inFrance are smaller than the French, and the British Front is apparently menaced more immediately, two British Divisions mightbe brought back at once from Italy to France, followed by french divisions. General Foch has asked to be informed by telegraph ofGeneral Robertson&apos;s views, and as to the earliest date on which theBritish divisions could begin their movement.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff expressed his opinionthat the Allied forces on the Western Front should be regarded aspart of the General Reserve of the Allies. Prom this point of view it seemed desirable that the question should be dealt with by thenew Allied Executive in control of the Reserves. Personally, how-ever, he agreed with General Foch that the British Divisions in italy ought to be brought back to the Western Front.The Secretary of State for War strongly urged that the divisions should be brought back. , He pointed out that general foch, who was not only the Chief of the French General Staff, but was also the President of the new Allied Executive in control of the reserves, strongly pressed it, and that the Chief of the imperialGeneral Staff supported him. The British and French Govern-ments had, on their own initiative, sent the Divisions to Italy; thecircumstances in which they were sent had now entirely changed ;the point of danger was now on the Western and not on the italian front ; and the Governments would therefore be perfectly within their rights in recalling the Divisions.On the other hand, it was pointed out that this question wasclosely connected with that of the employment of Italian troops onthe Western Front, the study of which had been remitted by theSupreme War Council to the Allied Executive in control of theGeneral Reserve. It was very desirable to secure as many ItalianDivisions as possible for the Western Front and for the general reserve, and if the British Divisions were reduced quite&apos;suddenlythe Italian Government might become nervous and decline to part with any Divisions at all.It was pointed out that on the 13th February General Haringtonhad expressed the opinion that the work the British forces in italy were now doing could be equally well clone by three Divisionsinstead of five (War Cabinet 315, Minute 1). It was also pointedout that, in the past, British and French Divisions had constantlybeen moved about on the Western Front in accordance with the exigencies of the military situation. For example, during theFlanders battle several French Divisions had co-operated on theBritish left, and on the conclusion of the battle they had been,withdrawn.
Enemy Attack onDover Patrol.(Restriction ofImports: paper and Pulp.The suggestion was made that the British Divisions might beused as a lever to induce the Italian Government to make a start with sending Divisions to the Western front. For example, we might inform them that unless they sent, say, four Italian Divisionsat once to the Western Front we should be compelled to withdrawtwo British Divisions. It was pointed out, however, that Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig might prefer to have two British ratherthan four Italian Divisions.As this question appeared primarily to affect the Field-MarshalGommanding-in-Chief the British Expeditionary Force, the WarCabinet decided 1. That the Chief of the imperial General Staff should ascertain from Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig whether he would prefer to be reinforced by two British or four ItalianDivisions from the Italian Front.2. That, in the event of a repl3&quot; by the l1 ield-Marshal that hewould prefer two British Divisions, the following action should be taken : (a.) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should send orders to the General Officer Commanding theBritish Expeditionary Force in Italy to send two british divisions at once to the Western Front, and that theChief of the Imperial General Staff should also notify the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.(&amp;.,,! That the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should at once notify the Italian Government of this step, In communicating with the Italian Governmenthe should inform them of the fact that the enemy, whilegreatly inferior to the Ailies on the Italian Front,had now achieved a superiority of force on the western front; and should add that the action now taken was consistent with the principles which had long governedthe distribution of foices between the British and Frenchsections of the Western Front, where the reinforcementshad always been distributed in accordance with the strategical exigencies of the moment.4. The First Sea Lord reported that during the preceding nightan attack had been made on the Dover Patrol by enemy submarines and destroyers. Full information was lacking, and a further report would be made on the following day. Two drifters had certainlybeen sunk.5. With reference to War Cabinet 830, Minute 1 (a), the WarCabinet had before them a Report of the Committee on theRestriction of Imports (Paper G.-19!) (Appendix), containingrecommendations in regard to the further restriction of imports.With regard to Paper and Pulp, the President of the Board ofTrade pointed out that before the War these imports amounted toabout 1,900,000 tons per annum. Last year they were cut downto 600,000 tons. In December 1917 another cut was authorisedamounting to 150,000 tons per annum (War Cabinet 292, Minute14). The Committee now recommended a further cut of 100.000tons, leaving only 350,000 tons this year as compared with 600,000tons last year. Last year the 600,000 tons had been divided asfollows :  Government purposesBoards and wrapping paperMagazines ...Newspapers ...100,000 tons,90,000   ,,160,000 ,,250,000   ,,
Cotton,PitwoodLThe President of the Board oil Trade stated that the proposedcut of .100,000 tons (bringing imports to less than one-fifth of thepre-War level) would necessitate reducing newspapers and periodicals below half their present size, entailing, presumably, the suppression of a number of them.The War Cabinet decided To adopt the recommendation of the Committee, that a further reduction on the basis of 100,000 tons a year should bemade.6. As to cotton, the President of the Board of Trade pointedout that there were now about -10,000 unemployed (mainly on rota)who were supported out of the proceeds of levies imposed on theindustry. This fund, however, would come to an end in dune.The proposed cut of a further 200.000 tons on cotton would involve an increase in unemployment of 75,000 operatives, and an increasedcut of work wages of, say, 250,000/, a month, or 3,000,0001. a year.It would further necessitate closing down some mills.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while 3,000,0001.a year did not seem an extreme figure, at the same time it would establish a principle of supporting unemployed, which might leadto far-reaching consequences.Mr. Churchill pointed out that if it came to a question of closing down cotton mills or munition works, of the two choices it shouldbe cotton and not munitions that should ho restricted, having regardto the fact that the reduction in munitions import would also causeunemployment without a direct war result,Sir Albert Stanley said  he agreed that cotton must be cutdown ;  whatever action was decided  upon, it was vital that theCotton   Control   Board&apos;s   scheme  of  levies   and   unemploymentpayments to operatives should not be interfered with, because ithad been accepted as part of a wages settlement.    Fie suggestedthat when the scheme came to an end in -June the whole financialposition should be considered.The War Cabinet decided-fa.) To adopt the Cotnmittee&apos;s recommendation, that  cottonshould be further restricted on the basis of 200,000 tons per annum.(6.) That the Board of Trade should take up with the treasury the question of financial assistance,(c.) That the   cotton  position  should   be reviewed   by   theRestriction of Imports Committee in June next.7. Sir Albert Stanley said that, in the opinion of the TimberController, a further reduction of 200,000 tons of pitwood,recommended by the Committee, was impossible, but that 1.00,000tons might be managed in the second half of the year, providedthat all the Departments concerned (e.g., the Ministry of Munitions,the Ministry of National Service, &amp;c.) rendered every possible assistance to the Timber Controller in regard to labour, transport,tools, &amp;c. The Timber Controller proposed to make up the balanceof 200,000 tons by sacrificing 75,000 tons of hard and soft woodfrom America, and 25,000 tons of imports from Scandiuavia.The War Cabinet decided To adopt the proposal of the President of the Board of Trade.8. Some discussion took place in regard to the Committee&apos;recommendation that the sugar ration should be reduced from 8 oz.to 6 oz. per head per week, in order to obtain a total saving of150,000 tons a year.
Lord Rhondda explained that since the last meeting of theCommittee he had had the food situation carefully analysed, and thatthe calorie value of other foods available was insufficient to permit of the proposed reduction being made. The minimum food indentpreviously approved by the War Cabinet was based on an averagerequirement of 4 billion calories per month. Of this figure, &quot;884 billioncalories should be provided by meat and fats, but at the present timenot more than &quot;443 billion calories were available. In these circum-stances the reduction of the sugar ration was bound to re-act on the cereal consumption, which at the present time was at a dangerouslyhigh level, having regard to the supplies available. He pointed outthat there was already widespread dissatisfaction in regard to thefood problem, and that a curtailment of the sugar ration so soon afterthe scheme had been, put into operation would introduce a newelement of discontent. On the other hand, it was pointed out thatno great objection had been raised by the public in regard to the-J-lb. ration, and that there were very large stocks of sugar in thecountry at present, amounting to some 170,000 tons, as comparedwith a stock of about only 23,000 tons at the worst time of last year.In reply to the suggestion that present stocks were sufficient topermit of the sugar ration being continued&apos; at the present rate untilMay next, Lord Rhondda explained that Cuba was now the only source of supply available, that large purchases had been made by the sugar commission, and that, unless these were lifted, they would probablybe^ acquired and consumed by the United States, with the result that,when, at a later stage we required to make good the deficiency, itwould be necessary to fetch supplies from Java. In view of theabove circumstances he strongly deprecated the suggestion to reducethe imports of sugar at the present time.In view of the critical tonnage situation, and the fact that thetotal amount of reductions now recommended by the Committee donot meet the tonnage deficit by upwards of 1,000,000 tons, the WarCabinet decided To adopt the Committee&apos;s recommendation that the sugar rationshould be reduced from 8 oz. to 0 oz. per head per week.Meat.. 9. Mr. Churchill and Lord Rhondda called attention to the3^    generous scale  of  meat rations prevailing   in   the Services   asy^y &amp;  compared with the civilian rations.y &quot;   &apos; It was suggested that the ration scales should be revised fromthe point of view of services rendered by the individuals.Lord Derby said that an enquiry on this subject had beenmade, and a system had been introduced whereby men in the samebarracks in England were receiving different amounts of food. Thesystem had led to grave discontent, and had been abandoned inconsequence. Subsequently he had revised the system in a way that had resulted in greater all-round economies. He said that he wasbearing in mind the necessity of making a further cut in the scale of rations.The War Cabinet decided To adopt the Committee&apos;s suggestion on the subject,and instructed    ; .The Secretary to ask the Departments concerned to revise the ration scales in the Army, the Navy, and the merchant service, from the point of view of the nature of the variousduties and the areas in which they were performed.[1365-347]C
We are informed that while there are at present about 40,000 cotton operativesout of employment there appears to be no unrest at the moment, because the opera-tives out of employment are being supported by a fund. This fund, however, will cease in June, and it may be that the Government will then have to- come to theassistance of the unemployed operatives if other work cannot be found for them.It is estimated that, roughly speaking, a further reduction of 200,000 tons ofcotton would mean a further 200,000 people being thrown out of employment.The President of the Board of Trade has undertaken to prepare a paper show-ing the results of reductions of different dimensions, ranging from 100,000 tons to250,000 tons.The Committee recommend that a substantial reduction should be made, havingregard, inter alia, to the fact that the reductions in munitions import also causeunemployment without a direct war result,9. Timber.The extensive felling of home-grown timber has been one of the cardinal points in the policy of Restriction of Imports without which the tonnage situation couldriot have been saved.In 1916 the imports Of timber were about 6,300,000 tons. In 1917, owing to restrictions imposed, the imports are estimated to have fallen to about 2,600,000 tons.In our previous Report (G.-178) we recommended another cut of 1,000,000 tonsof the 1917. We now recommend a further reduction in oitwood amounting to200,000 tons.In making this recommendation we feel bound to point out (a.) That the end of the tether, as regards the importation of timber, has almostbeen reached;(&amp;.) That in order to obtain the further amount of home-grown timber it willbe necessary for all Departments concerned (e.g., the Ministry ofMunitions and the Ministry of National Service) to render every possible assistance to the Timber Controller.i0. Sugar. &apos;,Sir Charles Bathurst has supplied us with details as to the sugar position. Ascompared with 1917 the situation is very satisfactory. There is now a stock of about170,000 tons as compared with a stock of some 23,000 tons at the worst time of lastyear.As regards further reduction it does not seem possible to take anything off theamount required for jam, and the only direction in which restriction might now bemade appears to be in domestic uses.The total domestic consumption for the year is estimated at about 610,000 tons.If the sugar ration were therefore reduced by a quarter, i.e., by two ounces fromeight ounces to six ounces, there would be a total saving of 150,000 tons a year.No great objection has been raised by the public in regard to the -j lb. ration,and it seems likely that the public will submit to a further reduction.In view of these facts we recommend the War Cabinet to authorise the reductionof the sugar ration from eight ounces to six ounces per head per week, in order toobtain a total saving of 150,000 tons a year.11. Meat.We have had under consideration the possibility of the further slaughter of cattle in this country, arid Lord Rhondda. has undertaken to examine the question with the Board of Agriculture. He has, however, told us that he cannot hold out any encouragement of further reductions in the stocks of cattle.In this connection we discussed the question of rationing in the army, navy, and merchant service. It was stated that whereas the civilian, working for instance on munitions, was lucky if he got 1\ lbs. of meat a week, a sailor at sea or a soldier atthe b,ase in Prance received \\ lbs. of meat a day.We are of opinion that the ration scales should be revised from the point of viewof work done, and as regards the army, of whether the area in Which the soldier isserving, is a combatant or non-combatant area. ,
We suggest that the War Cabinet should instruct the Departments concerned to revise the ration scales from the point of view of the nature of the various duties and the areas in which they are performed.12. Petroleum,.We have considered the question of reducing the imports of petroleum. our attention was called to the special importance of obtaining such tank vessels from america as would enable the Admiralty to dispense with the double bottoms for oil fuel. We also discussed the questions of increasing home supplies, and the desira-bility of restricting the use of petrol for commercial purposes such as retaildeliveries. These are matters which come within the province of the petroleum executive, and therefore we have written to ask that Committee to consider apossible reduction in the imports of petroleum.We hope that a reduction amounting to perhaps 50,000 tons may be possible, but until we hear from the Petroleum Committee we are not in a position to submit adefinite figure.13. Brewing.On the 1st January the question of whether a reduction of 50,000 tons couldbe made- in the amount of barley imported for brewing was referred to us- by theWar Cabinet (War Cabinet 309, Minute 4). We have examined the matter withrepresentatives of the Ministry of Food and the Liquor Control Board, and we have approved the proposal of the Ministry of Food that 250.000 quarters of barley(equivalent to 50,000 tons of freight) should be taken from the brewing trade andreleased for the loaf. We have also agreed to the proposal of the Ministry ofFood whereby a. saving of some 20,000 tons of freight per annum can be effected by substituting 3,000 tons per month of glucose for barley.A further considerable reduction, perhaps amounting to about one-third or one-fourth of the imports consumed could be effected without reducing the quantityof beer- supplied by forcing the strong proprietary brewers to dilute down to thestandard of other beer.We recommend to the War Cabinet that the downward dilution should bemade whereby a saving would be &quot;effected of about 200.000 tons of freight a year.We understand that the Shipping Controller is bringing the larger questionof total prohibition of brewing for separate and special consideration bv the WarCabinet at an early  date.i.4. Munitions.The Minister of Munitions has prepared a paper showing the effect of recentand proposed tonnage reductions.The shipping required to meet programmes of all Departments in full wouldbe 15,000,000 tons.   The actual imports in 1917 were 12,500,000 tons.On the basis of reductions imposed by the Restriction of Imports (G.-178), theimports in 1918 will be 11 millions The Minister of Munitions has now been requested to prepare two programmes for further reductions by (a) 1,000,000 tons,(&amp;) 1,500,000 tons, reducing the munitions import from the figure of last year by,500,000 and 3,000,000 tons respectively. Programme (a), involving 1,000,000 tonsadditional, will reduce the allocation to the Admiralty by 400,000 tons. no reduction was made from the allocations on the first cut of 1,500,000 tons, but inview of the objections to this proposal raised by the representatives of the Admiraltyat our meeting, we have asked that Department to state their case on the subjectto the War Cabinet.We hesitate, at present at any rate, to recommend programme (5) involving1,500,000 tons additional, because any further, reduction beyond the 1,000,000 tons would have to come directly off the gun ammunition programme which, as the WarCabinet will remember, was cut down, under our previous recommendations inDecember, by 500,000 tons of steel for army shell.We therefore recommend the War Cabinet to accept the Ministry of Munitions&apos;programme (a) for a further reduction of imports by 1,000,000 tons, including400,000 tons from the Admiralty, leaving it to the latter Department to state their case to the War Cabinet.
15. Summary of Recommendations.To summarise: The Committee were confronted by an additional estimated tonnage deficiencyduring the year of at least 2,500,000 tons.This deficiency may be off-set by restriction of imports in the following way: Ions..By Paper       ....... ... ... ... 100,000Cotton, say ... ... ... ... 200,000Pitwood    ... ... ...... ... 200,000,, Sugar ...... ... ... ... 150,000Brewing materials  ... ... ... ... 200,000,, Miscellaneous ... ... ... ... 100,000,, Munitions ... ... ... ...        1,000,000,, Oil, say (not yet agreed to by the petroleum executive)5Q,000Total2,000,00016. Remaining Deficit.It will thus be seen that the total amount of reductions, now recommended, donot meet the tonnage deficit by some 500,000 tons. Moreover, the Ministry ofMunitions&apos; figures as now stated only include 300,000 tons of phosphate rockwhereas the Board of Agriculture require 600,000 tons.Even the suggested reductions are open to further comment, as regardsMunitions by the Admiralty. Cotton and Miscellaneous by the Board of Trade, and oil by the Petroleum Executive. The authority of the War Cabinet will be required before they can be made effective.Further, the tonnage for the conveyance of 150,000 United States troops,amounting perhaps to 450,000 tons, has not been taken into account.There remains, therefore, a deficit of upwards of 1,000,000 tons. Having regard,however, to the extreme uncertainties of the tonnage situation, we are of opinionthat, for the present, we should leave this remaining deficit outstanding.It is too early to decide upon which Departments the further reductions should fall. The requirements of munitions obviously depend largely upon the date and scale at which the enemy attempts in the West are opened. There are many other factors which are not yet clear. We think it desirable that the Committeeshould reassemble at a later date, when the position should be re-examined.Meanwhile, we recommend that the Munitions Budget should be sanctioned onthe reduced basis of 10,000,000 tons import, and that the Department should have authority to place orders sufficiently in excess of this amount to make sure that every advantage may be taken of the accidents of shipment.CURZON OF KEDLESTON,Chairman,for the Committee.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,February 11, 1918.o
