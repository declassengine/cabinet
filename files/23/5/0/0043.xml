Theyhad expressed a desire to continue on friendly- relations with theAllies.economic offensive : NewIssues of Capital.yThe Western Front.3.8. With reference to War Cabinet 312, Minute 7, the WarCabinet had before them the Seventh Interim Report of theEconomic Offensive Committee, dealing with new issues of capital(Paper G.-183), together with the Report and recommendations ofa Sub-Committee consisting of the President of the Board of Trade,the Minister of Reconstruction, and the Financial Secretary to theTreasury (^0.-4^ (Appendix).The War Committee approved the recommendations of theSub-Committee, and appointed Mr. Stanley Baldwin as chairman of the proposed Committee of Ministers.9. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, in reply to aquestion as to the probability of an early German attack on theWestern front, stated that it depended upon factors as to which our knowledge was not precise, such as the internal situation inGermany, and the belief of the Germans as to whether they reallycould break through the Allied line. He quoted a particularlywell-informed Frenchman as holding the view that the Germans
were now convinced that they could break the line. If this informationwere correct, the best course for the Germans would be to wait untilthe country dried, in order to avoid fighting the mud as well as theallies; but, of course, the pressure of internal events, or other circumstances, might precipitate matters. For an offensive on thelargest possible scale the German railways offered much greater opportunities agaiirst the British than against the French line.British divisions on the italian front.-xs - 1,-&apos;*&quot;.3VSupply of RawMaterials from spain.10. With, reference to War Cabinet 847, Minute 3, the WarCabinet had before them a telegram from Signor Orlando to theItalian Ambassador (Paper G.T.-3fi78), in which surprise was expressed at the decision to withdraw two divisions from the italian front, and at the procedure followed in arriving at this decision,which appeared to be in contradiction with the recent deliberationsat Versailles. According to these deliberations, the question of thedestination of the Allied divisions on the Italian front was to beintimately connected with the constitution of the Special Reserve,and this had to be decided by an Inter-Allied Superior Councilfollowing the proposal of the Military Committee. Signor Orlandoalso called attention to the almost inevitable conclusion of peacewith Rouuiania, and the consequent release of Austrian battalions,which woidd be thrown against the Italian front.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff referred to the telegram which had been received from Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, inwhich he had expressed a preference to be reinforced by two Britishrather than by four ftalian divisions from the Italian front. He (sir henry Wilson i had some sympathy with Signor Orlandos complaintas to the procedure which had been followed. The matter ought tohave been considered at Versailles. He himself would not have advised the War Cabinet to bring back the two divisions at thepresent moment.Lord Derby said that he had wired the previous day to theftalian Minister of War. pointing out that there was now a pre-ponderance of divisions against us. He hoped the War Cabinet-would make no change in the decision which had been come to.The War Cabinet decided that The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should draft a suitablereply to be sent to Signor Orlando by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Prime Minister.11. With reference to War Cabinet 350, Minute 8, the WarCabinet took note of Lord milner&apos;s decision (Paper G.T.-3676) tothe following effect: (a.) For one month   coal to  be shipped  to the Rio TintoCompany in Spain for their requirements, estimated at about 5,000 tons ;(b.) Inter-Allied Chartering Committee to charter Spanish ships to carry that quantity at market rates ;(c.) Difference between 100s. and the market rate (at present about 400s.)!&apos;to be borne by the British Government.. N.B. On present rate of 400s., cost would be 15Z.a ton, or 75,000J. a month.(d.) No British ships to be directed into the trade for thispurpose;(e.) Foreign Office and Treasury to recover from French and united States Governments their share of the extra cost.[1366--351]B 2
12. With reference to War Cabinet 345, Minute 5, the PrimeMinister invited the War Cabinets consideration and approval oftwo letters regarding the situation, in the Irish Convention and theattitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government thereto, addressed to Mr. HughBarrie, M.P., representing the Ulster party, and. to Sir HoracePlunkett, respectively. These letters covered more or less the sameground, but the one addressed to Mr. Hugh Barrie was designed for submission to the Ulster Unionist Council, and the one to Sir HoracePlunkett for submission to the Convention. The letters revealedthe desire of the Government regarding the urgency of a settlementof the Irish question by agreement, should such prove to be possible.This desire was actuated by the importance, on international and imperial grounds, of reaching a settlement before the Peace-Conference. The Prime Minister stated that, when he placed theviews of the Government, arrived at by War Cabinet 345, Minute 5,the previous week before the various sections of the Convention, the ulster section of the Convention did not appear to have been shocked.However, Sir Edward Carson had not been present, and had refusedto see the Ulster representatives. Sir Edward Carson had writtenhim a perfectly non possumus letter. This attitude was most fortunate, and had not pleased some of the other Ulstermen, suchas Lord Londonderry.Mr. Long stated, in regard to Sir Edward Carson&apos;s action, thathe had been with him in Belfast on previous occasions. Sir edward carson was always most careful not to commit himself, and had adopted the attitude that he could decide nothing, but was willingto put matters before the Ulster Council for their decision. Heprobably wished to remain quite free at present,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that he found himself in a most embarrassing position. He agreed to theimportance of arriving at a settlement of the Irish question fromthe point of view of the war, the Empire, our relations with america, and the Peace Conference, but he differed fundamentallyfrom the methods proposed for achieving such a settlement. in common with most people, he believed that the Home Rule Act,as now upon the Statute Book, was unworkable, and, in his view, theonly possible way out of the difficulty was to divide Ireland. Therewere fundamental differences of race, religion, and economic interest,which separated North-East Ulster from the rest of Ireland. Inregard to that portion of the letter to Mr. Hugh Barrie, which referredto the growing desire for a settlement not only of the Irish question,but of devolution for the United Kingdom on Federal lines, he feltthat any attempt to impose a Federal system on the United kingdom was a retrograde and reactionary step. ... :   ,A further objection he felt to the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment was that no system which sought to give protection tothe Ulstermen, and which was based upon undemocratic lines, could possibly last. He therefore felt it necessary to request that hisprotest against the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government should be recorded.Mr. Long stated that there was undoubtedly a change of attitude on the part of the Belfast operatives. He gathered that itwould not take much to make the latter break with Sir edward carson. What the Belfast operatives were really keen on wasprogressive legislation dealing with such matters as temperance,education, housing, and industrial conditions. They consequentlyfelt that power of modification and veto over Irish legislation wasnot sufficient, and he (Mr. Long) shared, their view regarding thedesirability of obtaining for Ulster powers of initiating or adoptingsuch legislation. In regard to the actual position of the Convention,he feared that much of the discussion took place upon a wrong basis,namely, the basis of the 1914 Act. He thought it should be made clear to the Convention that such basis was illusory.Subject  to   certain  small   amendments,   the   War. cabinet approved the terms of the Prime Minister^ two letters.
Sinn-Fein Lawless- 13. The Chief Secretary for Ireland stated that there was aness in Ireland. re-appearance of serious trouble in some of the Western counties of Ireland, due to parties of Sinn-Feiners entering upon land for thepurpose of breaking it up- for tillage, and also of cattle-driving.Further, there had been cases of conflict between the Sinn-Feinparties and the Police. He asked for the covering authority of theWar Cabinet for proclaiming Sinn-Fein to be a dangerous Associa-tion in certain areas, under the Crimes Act.The War Cabinet gave this covering authority.Ireland: Treatment 14. Mr. Puke stated that there appeared to be a conspiracy on of Prisoners. the part of Sinn-Feiners, sentenced to imprisonment, to undergostarvation. The Irish prison doctors were unwilling to take theresponsibility of forcible feeding, and the Roman Catholic Bishopstook the view that such deliberate starving was a highly criminalact in the eyes of the Catholic Church. He was anxious, therefore,&apos; that no hunger-strikers should be released from prison without special reference to himself. The result might be that a certainnumber of these prisoners might die of starvation in prison, and hethought the Government should be prepared to accept the respon-sibility of such consequences.The Chief Secretary also sought die sanction of the WarCabinet to the arrest, and deportation if necessary (to the Isle ofMan or elsewhere), of Sinn Fein leaders whose speech or action wasdangerous to the public interest.The Prime Minister, on behalf of the War Cabinet, assuredMr. Duke that he continued to have the full support and authorityof the Cabinet in taking any measures he thought necessary fordealing with lawlessness and the maintenance of order in Ireland.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.February 22, 1918.
