Burgis, Assistant Secretary.The &quot; MorningPost&quot; :Article byLieut.-Col.Repington.WITH reference to War Cabinet 342, Minute 16, the Solicitor-General stated that, on the legal point, the article committed threeoffences against the Defence of the Realm Regulation No. 18,in that (a.) It published information regarding the disposition of forces ;(6.) It revealed a plan, or supposed plan ;(c.) It gave information likely to be of use to the enemy.As to the procedure to be adopted should the Cabinet decide totake action, he recommended the seizure by the Competent military authority rather than prosecution, as, in the event of a prosecution,not only would discussion of the subject dealt with by the article benecessary, but also one recalcitrant juryman might render the prosecution to all intents and jmrposes null and void. He had madea careful comparison between the original proof submitted to thePress Bureau and the article as published. The result of thiscomparison revealed the fact that, so far from anything important tothe legal case having been deleted in the published article, wordshad been added which showed deliberate defiance of the authority of
the Press Bureau. The passages omitted did not matter, and sothere had been not a diminution, but an aggravation of the offence.As regards the action that might be taken by the &quot; Morning Post&quot;on seizure, he stated that the &apos;: Morning Post &quot; could issue a writ fortrespass, which would come before a Judge of the King&apos;s Bench.General Macclonogh stated that, in the event of a prosecution,either he or some other General Officer of the War Office might becalled to appear as a witness, and in this event he felt some doubt as to the validity of the third point made by the Solicitor-general in his list of offences which he thought had been, committed bythe paper that is to say, he would find it very difficult to state on oath in a court of law that information had -been given whichwas likely to be of any great use to the enemy.In this connection the attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to Joint Note No. 15, dated the Oth February, 1918, by the military representatives of the Supreme War Council, signed by the fourgeneral officers representing the Allies. This note included thefollowing resolution, passed by the military representatives of theSupreme War Council on the 4th February, 1918 : &quot;The military representatives wish respectfully to draw the attention of the Governments represented on the supreme war Council to the undesirability, for military reasons, of any public discussion in the press or otherwise of the arrangements now being taken in hand for the creation and employment of an inter-Allied General Reserve.&quot;Attention was then drawn to a, sentence in the article which stated that a decision had been reached whereby the Allied forces onthe Western front were to be confined to a defensive role.General Macclonogh stated that, in accordance with the decisionof the War Cabinet (War Cabinet 338, Minute 3), the Press Bureauhad issued a typed message to all the principal newspapers (press notice No. 61) directing the editors of all newspapers that no reference should he made to the formation of a General Inter-Allied *Reserve or its command. The &quot;Morning&apos; Post&quot; had received this message, but, in spite of it, had submitted a proof of the article inquestion to the Press Bureau on the previous clay. This proof wasreturned by the Press Bureau stamped &quot; Not to be published.&quot; the solicitor-General further pointed out that mere defiance of the PressCensor was not sufficient to warrant seizure or prosecution, but thatthe offence lay in defiance of the Press Censor in the commission ofan offence.Lord Derby stated that he took the view that the gravamen ofthe charge against the &quot; Morning Post &quot; consisted in the defianceby the editor of the decision of the Press Bureau, and that any action taken on this ground would meet with his and with general public sujjport. He added that newspapers had been put on theirhonour in these matters.Invited by the Prime Minister to submit his views on thequestion of policj&apos;, Sir Gordon Hewart stated that in his opinion there were two points which could be put against the policy of taking any action, namely :  (a.) That the Government were dealing with a newspaper whichhad been continuously in favour of the vigorousprosecution of the war.(b.) That the mischief of the article had already been done by its publication.On the other hand, he felt strongly that a flagrant contravention of Regulation 18 had been committed, and that if no action were taken the whole present scheme of censorship would be renderednugatory and futile.   He therefore was in favour of the seizure by
the Competent Military Authority of the plant of the &quot;Morning-Post.&quot;Mr. Barnes stated that, unless action were taken in a case suchas this against a wealthy and prominent London newspaper, it wouldbe quite impossible to take proceedings against smaller Labournewspapers in future.Lord Milner stated that he felt some misgivings in taking theproposed course of action, due to the fact that the action would tendto advertise the very point which the Government desired to conceal.As between prosecution and seizure, he was definitely in favour ofseizure.The Prime Minister added that he felt that the most seriousfeature of the case was the publication, in defiance of the PressBureau, of an article openly professing to reveal the decisions of asecret War Council, not merely of the British Cabinet, but of thefour Western Allies. He was quite convinced that, unless action were taken in this case, it would be quite impossible to take actionagainst revolutionary newspapers at a future date. In considering this case the Cabinet were deciding whether or not any government control over the press was or was not possible.Lord Curzon drew the attention of the War Cabinet to anarticle which appeared on Sunday, the 3rd February, in the&quot; Observer,&quot; which also discussed the future military policy of theAllies.It was pointed out that this article advocated a policy ratherthan professed to give an account of the decisions actually taken,and also that, at the time when the &quot; Observer &quot; article had been written, no British representatives had returned from Versailles.The War Cabinet decided that Action should be taken by the Competent Military authority under Section 51 of the Defence of the Realm Regulationswith a view to the seizure of the press of the &quot; MorningPost &quot; for a breach of Regulation No. 18 of the Defence ofthe Realm Regulations until such time as satisfactory assurances are forthcoming.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,February 11, 1918.
