United States 2. With reference to War Cabinet 335, Minute J, the DirectorTroops in France.      ()f Military Intelligence informed the War Cabinet that two Americanc^/^j^TSjrS.     divisions were going into the line that day.    One of these would beon the Aisne, and another at Badenweiler.   These divisions were taking over a sector of the line purely for training purposes, and each division would be attached to a French corps.Possible german attack on theWestern Front.3. The Director of Military Intelligence stated, in answer to aquestion, that he did not anticipate any immediate attack by theGermans on the Western front. There Avas a certain amount of activity in the Aisne-Oise area, but nowhere else. According to his information, 62 or 63 German divisions were carrying on. intensivetraining behind the line, and German artillery was also going through a course of training in special practice camps.East Africa. 4. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that part ofGeneral Hawthorne&apos;s advanced force crossed the Lukulezi River, tothe east of the enemy.   The main body of Pamforce was moving toAnkuaba, and the enemy was reported to be in position 23 miles^&quot;further west, at Mesya.Submarines 5. The Deputy First Sea Lord  reported   that   two of  oui&quot;K. 17&quot;and&quot;K. 4.&quot;   submarines, &quot; Iv. 17 and Iv. 4,&quot; had been sunk in collision near the firth of Forth, and that two others had been damaged.   He wasSafraid that there had been loss of life.Poison Gas. 6. Mr. Churchill gave some details to the War Cabinet of theprogress made by ourselves and by the enemy with regard to themanufacture and use of poison gas. Mr. Churchill suggested thatGeneral Thuillier, who was in charge of the Poison Gas Branch ofthe Ministry of Munitions, should be called before the War Cabinetto give his views on the subject, which Mr. Churchill thought wouldbe of value.The War Cabinet decided that The Minister of Munitions should arrange for General Thuillierx/^ to attend a meeting of the War Cabinet at an early date.Supply of SteelEigid AirshipHousing-shedsunder ReducedAirship Pro-gramme.for 7. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theWar Priorities Committee (Paper G.T.-34:S8).Mr. Churchill said that, although this question had once beendecided by the &quot;War Cabinet, new conditions had been found to exist since that decision. The new feature was the diminishing supplyof steel. This coincided with an enhanced demand for production inwhich steel formed a main element. He admitted that the cut in steelimports could not be resisted, as that was the only import that could be cut. But he pointed out that the Admiralty demands for steel werethe only demands protected from any sort of proportional reductionHe asked that there should be a fair examination of the Admiraltydemands, in order that the whole reduction, required by thenecessity of the situation, should not be only at the expense of theArmy and Air Service. If the sheds could not be dispensed with,was it not possible for the Admiralty to effect an equivalentdiminution of its demands for steel in some other department ? Onthe merits, he doubted the validity of the claim for these sheds,when considered in relation to the whole situation. The three shedsrequired could not be completed, according to the Admiralty estimate,for 15^ and 20A months respectively.   He was advised thatthese figures were unduly optimistic.   The same kind of steel and
of skilled labour required for this work was, in his view, needed for more urgent undertakings. It was for the War Cabinet todecide what was to be cut.The First Lord said that the Admiralty view had been pre-sented to the Cabinet in the summer, that it had been repeated at various intervals since, and that it remained the same. This wasa reduced tame, and it had been understood that the Ministryof Munitions, after three months&apos; priority had been granted toaeroplanes, would raise no further objections. Airship sheds would greatly increase the value of the airships now being built, and enable them to undertake long-distance scouting over the Atlantic,and would provide &quot;lee&quot; sheds, and thus ensure us against loss ofships unable on account of unfavourable winds and bad weatherto make East Coast housing-sheds. If the decision of the WarCabinet were now revised, much time and labour would have been lost, and the only alternative would be an increased Light Cruiserprogramme.It was pointed out that the scarcity of steel was a new featurethat enforced reconsideration of the problem. The question was asked whether a decision not to build sheds would not render ituseless to build airships.Sir Eric Geddes replied that the ships were in course of construction, and that, although we had sheds on the East Coast,nothing could be substituted for the proposed structures on theWest Coast to shelter airships employed on long-distance reconnais-sance over the Atlantic.Lord Derby drew attention to the cutting of steel for shellproduction, and suggested that these sheds were in the nature of aluxury. The very long time that must elapse before they wouldmature must also be considered.Sir John Hunter expressed the opinion that the estimates onwhich the periods for completion had been calculated postulatedabsolute priority of labour and supplies. He had consulted theShipping Controller, who was not hopeful of carrying the material from England to Ireland in the time assumed.It was pointed out that means of cutting down the import of steel must be found, and the question was asked whether steelwas being used on any other construction requiring two years for completion.Sir Arthur Duckkain stated that the only instance was a new factory for the production of chemical gas filling, but that its steelrequirements were insignificant.   It should be ready early next year.Sir Eric Geddes pointed out that steel was being put into ships that would not be ready for a long period. He again reminded theWar Cabinet that the alternative to the sheds was a bigger light cruiser programme.The War Cabinet decided that No further supply of steel should be applied to the building ofthe three housing-sheds in question for rigid airships.The TurkishTheatre of War.8. With reference to War Cabinet 332, Minute 1, the WarCabinet expressed a wish that, if the First Lord&apos;s arrangements, inconnection with his forthcoming visit to the Mediterranean, made it possible for him, he should go to Alexandria in order to consult withGeneral Smuts on the question of transportation.Strike of Sheet-Metal Workers.9. With reference to War Cabinet 329, Minute -2, the Ministerof Munitions called attention to the serious situation consequent onthe continuance of the strike of sheet-metal workers in the london area. It was most desirable^ that someone should assume full responsibility for dealing with it and bringing it to an end.
At the request of the War Cabinet Mr. Barnes undertook to examine the matter that afternoon withrepresentatives  of  the  Ministry  of Munitions and theMinistry of Labour, and should report to the War Cabineti/&apos; what action they advised should be taken.Irish CivilianLabour for France.10  The War Cabinet asked-The Secretary of State for War to examine, with the Minister ofLabour-, a demand for 500 Irish civilian labourers wanted to carry out the combined Anglo-American Tank programme in France.Man-Power :Position of theAmalgamatedSociety of engineers.3X11. With reference to War Cabinet 323, Minute 13, the attentionof the War Cabinet was called to the present position of the conflict between the Minister of National Service and the amalgamated society of Engineers. It seemed certain that a strike would take-place unless some means were devised to reopen negotiations. Itwas important to remember that Sir Auckland Geddes had obtained the approval of the &quot;War1 Cabinet in the steps which he had undertaken up to the present. In to-da3-&apos;s newspapers therehad appeared a mischievous letter from Mr. Arthur Henderson.The letter had been shown by the Press Bureau, before publication, to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the HomeSecretary, who agreed that there was no alternative but to allow it to appear, It appeared that the whole of the press took a viewopposed to the Government, and in such circumstances it would liedifficult for the Government to refuse to meet the Engineers.Mr. Bonar Law said that he had discussed the position that morning with Sir Auckland Geddes, who had offered to resign, buthe (Mr. Bonar Law) had insisted that the Government were responsible for the policy which had been adopted. Sir auckland geddes was preparing a reply to Mr. Henderson&apos;s letter, and wouldbe able to make out an effective case for the Government. Themost serious aspect of any concession which the Government mightbe inclined to make to the Engineers was the announced intentionof the other unions to break off their engagements in the event ofsuch concession. On the other hand, there was the widespreadfeeling in the country that the Government were standing aloofsolely on a point of form.The War Cabinet were agreed that any statement issued by theMinister of National Service should not close the door againstnegotiations with the Engineers, and decided To adjourn the consideration of  the subject  to a cabinet meeting to be held at 5&apos;30 that afternoon.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,February I, .19JS.
