Sir Edward Kemp. j.. THE Prime Minister welcomed Sir Edward Kemp to themeeting of the War Cabinet.Canadian Man-power.n. /2. Sir Edward Kemp stated that the 100,000 men the canadian government jxroposed to raise by conscription were now civiliansand could be reckoned as over and above the number now in the recruiting depots. Before further drafts could be made, theconsent of Parliament would have to be obtained. There was astrong feeling in Canada that the United States, with their largereserves of man-power, should now do their share.New ZealandMan-power,itRussia.3. The Secretary of State for the Colonies expressed the opinionthat there was very little chance of obtaining many more recruitsfrom New Zealand.4. The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated thatthe news from Russia was not encouraging, although a hitchhad occurred in the peace negotiations. He then read telegramNo. 4 from Petrograd, dated 1st January, 1918, in which the british military attache said that M. Trotzki had postponed the re-assemblyof the Joint Conference, as the Germans had tried to trick him ;also differences had arisen over the &apos;: no annexation&quot; clause.M. Trotzki maintained that the enemy delegates at Brest-Litovskagreed to evacuate the occupied territory in order to allow thepopulation to select their form of government without pressure.The enemy stated that assemblies of notables in Poland and Courlaiidhad already declared their wish for independence, while remaining in the sphere of the Central PoAvers. It was stated that Kuhhnannwas in Berlin endeavouring to induce the German General Staff toagree to M. Trotzkis wishes. The telegram stated, in conclusion,that M. Trotzki and his friends had so ruined the Russian armythat if he does break off negotiations the enemy will advance a fewkilometres and capture his guns. Telegram No. 5 was also referredto, in which the British Ambassador stated that the Bolsheviks haddiscovered a German plot, and that thev might have to break off.negotiations, and they therefore wanted to know what assistance might be expected from America should they have to go on. with thewar.The Prime Minister asked the Director of Military Operationswhether he would prefer the Russians to continue in the war atthe price of the loss of the guns, as described by the ActingSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, or a separate peace.General Maurice replied that he would prefer the former, as,though there was little hope from the Northern Russian front, thesituation in the South would keep the Austrians engaged.Mr. Lone&apos; suggested that it might be worth while for the WarCabinet to obtain information from a certain Mr. Lattimore, anEnglishman who had just returned from Petrograd, where hisbrother, a bookseller, still resided. Lattimore could put the PrimeMinister in touch with M. Trotzki.During the meeting the Acting Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and General Smuts saw Mr. Lattimore m an adjoining room,but, as a month had elapsed since he had left Petrograd, no information of special value was elicited, beyond an expression ofMr. Lattimore&apos;s personal opinion that M. Trotzki was an honestidealist.
War Priorities:Admiralty and mercantile Ship-building-.5. General Smuts raised the question of the position, in a schemeof priorities,   of   the   naval   and   mercantile   shipbuilding   pro-rimes.The War Cabinet confirmed the decision which they had taken on the Sth February, 1917 (War Cabinet 58, Minute I), bywhich the Naval programme had been partially cut down,but, subject to that reduction, had retained priority overmerchant shipbuilding.Trade War:Denunciation ofCommercialTreaties.G. With reference to War Cabinet 248, Minute 13, the WarCabinet had before them interim report No. 6 of the Committeeappointed to consider the question of an Economic Offensive (paper g.-177).Sir Edward Carson explained that the report gave additionalreasons for the policy already approved by the War Cabinet ofdenouncing commercial treaties. He drew special attention to paragraph 5 of the report, dealing with the state of opinion in theHouse of Commons. In view of the criticism of, and opposition to,the Non-ferrous Metal Bill and the Imports and Exports TemporaryControl Bill, it was most desirable that a statement of the general commercial policy of the Government should be made as early aspossible, in order that the significance of each Bill, in relation to thepolicy as a whole, should be appreciated. It was most undesirable that the measures connected with the economic offensive and withpost-war reconstruction should become entangled with the fiscalcontroversies which had agitated the country before the war.Dr. Addison said he thought, when the position was explained to business men, they would recognise at once the necessity of theproposed legislation. It was not necessary at this stage to commit ourselves to the details of the control of trade beyond intimating that imports and exports would be regulated by licence.Sir Albert Stanley stated that the Bill dealing with imports and exports could be considered without any declaration on theGovernments general&apos; policy in the future. Power to extend thecontrol of imports and exports to the period after the stoppage ofhostilities was absolutely essential to prevent chaos. On the questionof the control of raw materials, he hesitated about making anvGovernment declaration, because of the enormous difficulties of putting such control into effective operation. The matter was atpresent before him at the Board of Trade, but so far no solution ofthe difficulties involved had been discovered.Mr. Long said that he was certain that the Dominion Govern-ments would give the most favourable consideration to any proposalsfor control of materials within the Empire, which might be placed before them.Lord Robert Cecil said that it was essential to have the powerof suspending the most-favoured-nation clause, in order to enable usto fulfil our obligations to our Allies. The rebuilding of Belgium,for example, could not take place without such a suspension.Mr. Churchill said that he was in agreement with the measures proposed, in so far, and only in so far, as they were war measures and necessary for the wearing down of the enemy.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Imports and Exports Control Bill should be consideredby Parliament at the earliest possible date ;(6.) A convenient Opportunity should be found at an early date for a statement of the general commercial policy of theGovernment in relation to the war and to the transition period immediately following the war ;(c.) The Report of the Economic Offensive Committee (paper g.-177) be approved, but that such approval should not
compromise the political and economic views of anyoneagreeing to it, the measures proposed being accepted as essential as a war measure for bargaining in the peacenegotiations and for the rationing of materials in the transitional period at the close of the war.New Issues of 7. The War Cabinet had before them the seventh interim reportCapital. 0  j.]ie Economic Offensive Committee, dealing with new issues of^ 1 capital (Paper G.-183).v-^-. J       , Sir Edward Carson explained that it was not proposed toV- &apos; abolish   the   New Issues Committee   at   present acting for theTreasury, but that there should be a right of appeal to a Committeeof Ministers by the Minister responsible for any Department whoserecommendation had not been accepted by the New Issues Com-mittee.The War Cabinet decided that  The matter should be adjourned until the Chancellor of theExchequer could be present.War Aims ^ g  The pr;me Minister said that the War Cabinet had had^/ several conversations on the subject of the action to be taken inj^C-^- /- regard to the statement issued by the enemy on the 25th December* * of their negotiations for peace with the Bolshevik Party in Russia.Although the Allies were not in diplomatic relations with the Bol-sheviks, and did not recognise their authority to treat for peace onbehalf of Russia, these negotiations had resulted in an importantdeclaration of policy by the Central Powers.   The War Cabinet had felt that we ought not to pass this declaration by unnoticed.   we ought to take advantage of it to issue such a declaration of our ownwar aims as would maintain our own public opinion, and, if possible,lower that of the enemy.   In fact, the view to which the WarCabinet inclined was to issue a declaration of our war aims which went to the extreme limit of concession, and-which would show toour own people and to our Allies, as well as to the peoples of Austria,Turkey, and even Germany, that our object was not to destroy theenemy nations.    He thought that there was a general agreement ofthe War Cabinet as to the kind of terms which we could offer. Theymust include the restoration of Belgium, and reparation for all the damage inflicted on that country.    The same applied to Serbia and roumania.    Germany had as yet not even offered complete restora-tion of Belgium, for there were phrases in the enemy statement which suggested the possibility of the retention of garrisons andeconomic control.    Much less had Germany made any suggestion of reparation.   On this point we might hope even to secure the assent of the Russian Bolsheviks.     The next point brought us on to much more  disputable ground, namely, Alsace-Lorraine.    What-ever might be the opinions held by individuals as to the prob-ability that France could realise the whole of her war aims inthis respect, it would be dangerous at this stage of the war tosuggest the contrary.   We should treat Alsace-Lorraine as a matter in which we would support the wishes of the French democracy,who were making very great sacrifices.   In regard to Italy, wecould indicate in general terms our support to the Italian claims tobe united with the peoples of Italian nationality now under Austrianrule, without specific reference to the whole of the Italian war aims.Some reference ought to be made in our statement to such racesas the Italians, Croats, Slovaks, Czechs, &amp;c, who are under Austrianrule, and who seek some form of autonomy.   A statement shouldalso be made in favour of an independent Poland.The most difficult point, so far as we were concerned, related tothe German colonies.   We must remove the impression, sedulously
spread about by German propaganda, that we were merely trying to annex more territory to an over-gorged Empire. He thought theWar Cabinet were in general agreement that our proper coursewould be to express our willingness to accept the application of theprinciple of self-determination to the captured German colonies.Precisely how the principle was to be applied need not now bediscussed, but there were chiefs and beads of tribes who could be consulted. The same principle might be applied in the case ofMesopotamia which was occupied by Arabs and not by Turks and in the case of Palestine, which had a very mixed population.Our attitude should be that we were not going to hand these territories back to the Germans or Turks unless their inhabitantsexpressed a preference for German or Turkish rule. The first stepto be taken, therefore, was to draw up a statement of the case forthe consideration of the War Cabinet, in accordance with the democratic principles enunciated by the Bolsheviks and to someextent accepted by the enemy.The next question which arose was as to whether we were todiscuss the question with all our Allies before publishing a state-ment. Tins would take some weeks, and it would be very difficultto draw up a document to which general assent would be givenwhich did not lack virility and individuality. Hence, if an answer was to be given promptly, this course was unsuitable, and we oughtto adopt President Wilsons plan of an independent statement.If this was agreed on, the question arose as to the form which our answer should take. Should it be a note, and, if so, to whomshould it be addressed - We could not send a note to M. Trotzki,since we were not in diplomatic relations with him : neither could we send it to Count Czernin. because that would involve opening-negotiations with the enemy. An alternative was to issue anofficial statement. Our Allies might justly complain if we took thiscourse.A second alternative was to make a statement in the form of a speech. Speeches were constantly made by political leaders of allthe Allies, and there was no obligation to consult them before makinga speech.The suggestion that had been made to him was that, in thecourse of the negotiations which Sir Auckland Geddes was con-ducting with the trades union leaders on the subject of man-powerand the release from certain pledges entered into earlier in the war,it should be arranged that the Prime Minister should read a carefullyweighed statement of the War Cabinet&apos;s policy. This was the moreeasy to provide for, since it was understood that the trade unionistswould raise the question of war aims in the course of the discussions with Sir Auckland Geddes. If the War Cabinet agreed to such astatement, it should, in his opinion, be couched in terms which wouldprovide a counter-offensive to Count Czernins recent statement, andwhich would weaken the enemy. The Germans had got their blowin first in this peace offensive, but there were not lacking signs thatit was beginning to expend its force. Personally, he did not believethat the enemy&apos;s statement was a bond fide peace offer. Its object was to sow dissension among the Allies and to rally the Germanpeople.Sir Edward Carson drew attention to an article in the &quot; CologneGazette&quot; which indicated alarm on the part of the Germans lestthey should be taken at their word in regard to their statement ofpeace terms.Mr. Barnes stated that he attached great importance to the psychological effect which would be produced at home by the issueof a full and reasoned statement of our war aims.Lord Robert Cecil said that he would like an opportunity toexpress his views at full length, both in regard to the form andsubstance of the statement to be issued. He warned the Wat-Cabinet  that  the  speeches   of Ministers  in  this  country, and
particularly those of the Prime Minister, were very closely scrutinisedhy our Allies. He was opposed to any unnecessary delay, but he urged that the subject should be most carefully weighed before adecision was taken.The Secretary of State for the Colonies urged that, before any statement were made, he should communicate the general lines of itto the Governments of the self-governing Dominions.The Prime Minister agreed, and suggested that Mr. WalterLong should tell the Dominions the reasons for making the statement.He thought that the press should be warned that this was intendedas a counter-offensive to Count Czernin&apos;s statement.One point which he proposed to add, if the War Cabinet agreed,was that if the Russian democracy had not taken the responsibilityof entering into negotiations with the enemy by themselves, weshould have stood by them, as we intended to stand by the Frenchdemocracy.This was agreed to.The War Cabinet decided that (1.) The question should be adjourned until 5 p.m.(2.) Mr.  Barnes, who was to take the chair at Sir AucklandGecldes&apos;s conference with trade unionists in the afternoon,should endeavour to secure an opportunity for the PrimeMinister to make his statement on Saturday, if an earlier        &apos; L 1moment could not be arranged.(3.) Before the meeting at 5 o&apos;clock, the Secretary shouldreproduce and circulate the three draft statementsprepared respectively by Mr. Philip Kerr, under instruc-tions from the Prime Minister, General Smuts, and lord robert Cecil.(4.) The Secretary of State for the Colonies should be authorisedto telegraph to the self-governing Dominions informing them that a statement was to be made, and explaining the reasons for this course.Obligations to Our 9. Sir Edward Carson said that he found great difficulty inAllies: folio wing what our obligations were to our Allies, and suggested that german Colonies.      ;i synopsis should be made by the Foreign Office  showing (withmaps) the obligations we had undertaken.   Sir Edward Carson saids / L t-*C- &quot;p.       it would be a great help if he could give a paper of this sore to theChairman of the Newspajier Proprietors&apos; Association (Sir GeorgeRidded). XD);The Prime Minister thought the latter suggestion inadvisable.Attention was drawn to a Memorandum prepared in the ColonialOffice (Paper G.T.-3174) on the subject of the disposal of the german colonies.Mr. Long said that the l-e-establishment of Germany in the pacific would expose the United States of America and Canada togreat danger, and would involve an additional burden on GreatBritain.The Prime Minister suggested that a copy of this Paper shouldbe sent to the President of the United States of America.The question was postponed for the further discussion agreed toon Tuesday, the 1st January, 1918 (War Cabinet 309,Minute 18).The War Cabinet decided however, that In the meantime the Foreign Office should prepare a synopsis,with maps.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,January 3, 1918.o
