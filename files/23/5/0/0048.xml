The western front: possible german Attack.y.The Italian Front1. WITH reference to a report, received from Frenck sources,that the enemy hoped to capture Calais by the 15th March, theDirector of Military Operations stated that the General Staff had ascertained that, the report emanated from German agents in France.His general deduction was that this information merely confirmedour previous intelligence, that the enemy would be ready by thesecond week in March, and that there were indications of preparations for an attack and concentrations on the Arras-Cambraifront (War Cabinet 351, Minute 2).2. Attention was drawn to the fact that the various rumoursnever pointed to the probability of an attack on the Italian front,although attacks on nearly all the other fronts were hinted at.The Director of Military Operations repeated the information given by the Director of Military intelligence (War Cabinet 353,Minute 2) that there were no signs of more than local, enemy concentrations in that region. This did not exclude the possibilityof an attack on the Italian front later on, and if the enemy&apos;internal condition enabled him to postpone his attack until May, itwas by no means unlikely that a great attack might take place inthat theatre.The Prime Minister asked that General Plumer, on leaving theItalian command, might attend a meeting of the War Cabinet inorder to give the latest information.Rumoured NavalAttack.3. Attention was drawn to various rumours that an attack onthe Western front might be accompanied by a naval attack.The first Sea ford stated that there were no signs of animpending naval attack, and he did not think this was possible at. present, as the enemy were fully engaged in the Baltic.Palestine. 4. In answer to a question, the Director of Military Operationsstated that General Allenby&apos;s intention was to cross the Jordan andcut the Hejaz Railway. If he accomplished this, it was almost certain that Medina would eventually be evacuated or surrendered.It was also possible that we should be able to take an area east ofthe Dead Sea from which supplies.es might be drawn. The Directorof Military Operations said that, according to our estimate, therewere two Turkish divisions along the Hejaz Railway, including they garrison at Medina.Review of theMilitary Situation.2- -3 .) f5. The &quot;War Cabinet asked that the General Staff should give ageneral review of the whole military situation. They agreed,however, to the suggestion of the Director of Military Operationsthat it should be postponed until the question of our policy inPalestine and Mesopotamia had been decided.The War Cabinet suggested that, when the Memorandum was prepared, the General Staff should state their view as to thepossibility of a military decision being arrived at ultimately, andthat the General Staff should, in particular, take into considerationmechanical devices and especially a great development of the supplyof tanks, on which question the General Staff should confer withthose in charge of tank construction and tactics.Austrian Participa- 6. In answer to a question, the Secretary of State for Foreigntion in Offensive Affairs stated that he was without any authentic knowledge of theagainst Russia. refusal of the Austriaus to take part in the offensive which was nowri/ being conducted against the Russians.
Russia. 7. The Prime Minister drew the attention of his colleagues tothe very conflicting information from Russia, which was probably due to divided counsels, as indicated in Mr. Ransome&apos;s despatchesto the &quot; Daily News.&quot; Some of the telegrams indicatedmere surrender, while others suggested an intention to resist. Inthis latter category he referred to the latest telegram fromMr. Lockliart (No. 595), in which M. Petroff was reported to contem-plate a withdrawal to Nijni-Novgorod and the formation there of anarmy of .1,000,00U men, for which he desired Allied assistance. ThePrime Minister asked whether the possibilities of a formidableguerilla warfare had not been underrated. History in Spain and elsewhere had shown that large numbers of troops could be occupiedby these means, particularly in forest country.The Director of Military Operations pointed out that develop-ments of modern warfare, such as aircraft, armoured cars, and machine-guns, were all in favour of regular, and against gxierilla,troops. He admitted the possibility, however, that an activeguerilla warfare in Russia might still be very troublesome to they&apos; enemy.M. Kameneflf. g   With reference to War Cabinet 353, Minute 10, attention was drawn to Mr. Ramsay MacDonahTs account in the House ofI       Commons of the treatment accorded to M. Kameneff and his fellow, i^-0 /     Bolsheviks in this country, and to the subsequent debate.rj/y^ The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that he had/ &apos;&apos; given orders that these gentlemen should be treated with every consideration, and that he had stopped their beiug sent straight toFrance, as had been suggested, and he had since heard that theFrench Government would not receive them. M. Kameneff was nowbeing allowed to stay in this country until arrangements could bemade for his return to Russia. Mr. Balfour added that the greaterpart of M. Kameneff s baggage had not been opened and examinedy&apos; by the police.Railway transport in France :General Nash&apos;sReport.3-9. With reference to War Cabinet 355, Minute 9, in which itwas decided that the Secretary should send a copy of General Nash&apos;sReport oa Railway Transport in France, to Versailles for theconsideration of the military representatives of the Supreme WarCouncil, the Secretary of State for War requested that theWar Cabinet should decide whether General Nash&apos;s recommenda-tions should be accepted. He pointed out that the decision to refer the matter to Versailles meant delay at a time when delay would be especially inconveuient.The War Cabinet agreed with this view, and requested -The Secretary of State for War to send a copy of GeneralNash&apos;s Report to the Allied Governments concerned, andto ask whether they concur, and to nominate theirrepresentatives.Submarine attackon AmericanDestroyer. i/10. The First Sea Lord stated that an enemy submarine had made an unsuccessful attack on an American destroyer.Shipping Losses, 11. Attention was drawn to the severe losses from enemy submarines during February as compared with January.The First Sea Lord attributed this to the fact that the enemy&apos;sattacks appeared to be spasmodic, and that during January we had succeeded in preventing a number of enemy submarines leavingport, but during February they had been coming out in greatery  numbers.[1365-356]
Publication of 12. With reference to War Cabinet 349&quot;, Minute 5, when the mercantile Losses War Cabinet approved the publication of mercantile losses fromfr in Submarines.       , i       - i -   ,  .    ^i     n -       -\,r-  - .    * i r, -submarines, subject to the Prime Ministers approval, the PrimeMinister expressed some doubt as to the desirability and necessityof this action. He questioned the suggestion in the First Sea Lord&apos;smemorandum that the reduction in mercantile output was in realitydue to slackuess on the part of labour. He thought that manycauses were operating. Unless absolutely compelled, he was reluctant to publish these figures. Me felt that the real reason forthe reduction of output required to be probed to the bottom before a decision was taken.Dr. Macnamara said that the shortage was due not so much tostrikes as to the fact that the men were not working with good-will.Phis was due to the fact that the time rate, plus the 20s. bonus,plus the 121- per cent., brought the men&apos;s wages to within 7 or 8 percent, of their piece rates, and, therefore, there was no inducement towork on piece rates.The decision was reserved until the Prime Minister had heldcertain conferences with the First Lord of the Admiralty,u &apos; shipbuilders, and others.Year 1917The War Cabinet 13. With reference to War Cabinet 2o6, Minute 10, the Warv!?,01^ the Cabinet had before them the proofs of the War Cabinet Report forthe year l!il7.The suggestion was made that the Report would be more suitable if it constituted merely a record of facts instead of being a document of high literary merit. It would be criticised as a partisanvindication of the Governments policy, and its publication at thepublic expense might be resented.In reply, it was pointed out, however, that eulogy had been omitted, and that a large number of facts in the original documenthad been suppressed because Government Departments had con-aidered that publication was not in the public interest.   .It was also pointed out that many Government Departments, aswell as the Governments of India and Egypt, published annual reports.Mr. Long, who paid tribute to the style of the Imperial and colonial section, suggested that the precedent of the ImperialConference Reports might be followed, and that merely the headings of the confidential portions should be retained.The Report was criticised on the ground that the cumulative effect was to accentuate the strain which had been placed on us bythe enemy&apos;s submarine activities, and that it might afford encourage-ment to the enemy.Mr. Cecil Ilarmsworth stated that the Report was beingcarefully scrutinised from this point of view, and it was hoped torender it harmless.The military chapter was also criticised, on the ground that it did not give sufficient credit to the great achievements of the Army.The War Cabinet approved the publication of the Report, and requested Lord Curzon to go through it, with the authors, with a view toen phasising the achievements of our military forces andeliminating such passages as might convey the impression that the book was a eulogy of the Governments activities.
Man-Power:Position of theAmalgamatedSociety of engineers.15. With reference to War Cabinet 339, Minute 4, the PrimeMinister stated that he had received a telegram from the general secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers announcing theresult of the recent ballot of the society on the Governments pro-posals, and asking the Prime Minister to receive a deputation of delegates to consider the position of their organisation. Accordingto the telegram there had been a majority of 93,000 against theproposals of the Government.Sir Auckland Geddes recounted the history of the disputeSinn-Fein Lawless- 14. With, reference to the War Cabinet 355, Minute 16, theness in Ireland.        War Cabinet had before them a further telegram from Mr. Duke(Paper G.T.-3751).- &apos;t^3^f The Prime Minister stated that he had received a documentfrom Professor Mahaffy, of Trinity College,  Dublin, enclosing a3. Memorial signed by 40 per cent, of the members of the Convention,stating that the memorialists took a strong view that the properconsideration of the Prime Minister&apos;s letter was prejudiced by theprevalent lawlessness in certain parts of Ireland. A. further letteron the same subject had been received, in even stronger language,from fifteen high sheriffs of counties in Ireland, and a letter from lord Granard (a Liberal Home Ruler j, who, as Lord Lieutenant ofthe County of Longford, took a serious view of the agrarian outrageswhich were threatened in that county.The Home Secretary stated that he gathered from Mr. Dukestelegram that he took the view that the deportation of Irishundesirables from Ireland would be rendered ineffective unless a permit system were established which would prevent the return of these undesirables to Ireland. As far as he was concerned hehad no objection to the establishment of a permit system.Mr. Long welcomed the proposal to establish a permit system,not only on the grounds already put forward, but also on theground that a great deal of unnecessary travelling between Englandand Ireland was now taking place. The trains and boats wereovercrowded, and a permit system might help to remedy this evil.Further, he thought it would be good policy to take powers by regulation to restrict the movement, and even to fix the place of residence, of Irish undesirables in this country.The President of the Board of Education stated that in his constituency most of the labour difficulties were caused by Irishagitators.General Cockerill expressed the view that power already existed, under the Defence of the Realm Act Regulations, whichwould enable the Government to contine Irish undesirables to a given area, but he feared that the proposed permit system would prove ineffective unless all the small as well as the large portswhence vessels plied to Ireland were carefully watched.The Home Secretary suggested that the best course would beto prepare a new Regulation under the Defence of the Realm Actfor establishing a permit system, and to get the machinery forthe purpose in order. The time when the Regulation should bemade and put into practice could then be left to the three Depart -ments concerned, namely, the Home Office, the Irish Office, andthe War Office, to determine.The War Cabinet approved that the proposed new Regulationshould be framed, and requested  The Secretary of State for War, the Secretary of State for HomeAffairs, and the Chief Secretary for Ireland to consult together with a view to giving effect to the Regulation assoon as the necessary machinery had been established andthe Chief Secretary so desired.
between the Engineers and the other Unions. It was important notto go back on the arrangement come to Avith the other Unionswithout their consent, because it was from among their membersthat by far the greater number of recruits would be taken.- Theactual number of men from the Engineers&apos; Society to be taken com-pulsorily was not great. He thought the engineers, having realised that they could not secure a two-thirds majority in favour of astrike, were now seeking a way out of their difficulties. He saw noobjection to the Prime Minister receiving a deputation within thelimits laid down in the telegram from their General Secretary.Mr. Herbert Fisher said that, according to his information, thegeneral body of workmen were strongly opposed to the attitude taken up by the Amalgamated Society of Engineers.The War Cabinet decided that- The Prime Minister, accompanied by Mr. Barnes andSir Auckland Geddes, should receive the deputation that afternoon at 5&apos;30 P.M., and a telegram to the general secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers wasagreed to.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.,February 28, 1918.or
