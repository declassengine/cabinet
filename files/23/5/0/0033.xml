First, he had that morning receiveda formal protest from M. Litvinoff against the further enlistment ofRussian subjects into the British Army. The protest includedthreats to publish the correspondence that had passed concerningthis matter. Cinder War Cabinet, 329, Minute 12. Lord Derby hadbeen requested to summon a Committee to consider this question,but so far the Committee had not met. He feared that &quot;an awkwardincident was threatened, and that further delay in giving an answer to M. Litvinoff could not be arranged. Secondly, a meeting hadtaken place on the previous evening, at which General Maedonoghand Count Horodysky, the representative of the Polish Councilin London, had met Lord Robert Cecil and himself. CountHorodysky had informed them that there were now in existencethree organised Polish Armies amounting to upwards of 00,000 men,who were well-paid, well-fed, and armed. It was claimed that thesePolish forces had captured Krylenko and the Bolshevik Head-quarters Stall at Mohileff, and were about to march upon Smolensk.Thirdly, a telegram had been received that morning from theBolsheviks, submitting a complaint regarding the removal of storesfrom Vladivostock. In addition, a further telegram had beenreceived from Mr. Lockhart, at Petrograd (F.O. 358), dated the(5th February, regarding the desirability of giving a visa to thepassports issued by the Bolshevik Government to Messrs. Petroffand Chichirin to visit England, and regarding the recognition tobe given to the Bolshevik Government. The closing paragraph ofthis telegram stated that there was no time to lose, and Mr. Lockhartpleaded most earnestly that, immediate consideration should begiven to the policy which he advocated.The Prime Minister stated that he wished to emphasise what he had said on the previous day regarding the inadvisability of refusing to accept the advice given by the man on the spot, viz.,Mr. Lockhart. He added that he did not doubt Mr. LockharPsviews as to the influence which the Bolsheviks were bringing to bearin Germany and Austria-Hungary. Fie shared entirely the general principles laid down by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs innis draft that the internal politics of that part of Russia where the 8. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff reported that an enemy submarine, possibly the one which torpedoed the &quot; Tuscania,&quot; hady probably been sunk the previous night off the Mull of Cantyre.
Bolsheviks were the de facto Government was no concern of ours.In regard to the Polish movement, he gathered that the Polisharmies in question were engaged not in fighting the Germans and austrians, but in fighting the Bolsheviks. This was no concern ofours, and they could only bo regarded as our friends if they divertedtheir armies against the Germans or Austrians, or, as was suggested,to the assistance of our Roumanian Allies. He thought that, byaccording the degree of recognition to the Bolshevik Governmentsuggested by Mr.&apos; Lockhart, we should be in a position to influence the Bolsheviks in the direction of according better treatment to the roumanians. In this connection he drew an analogy between thepresent situation and that, which had been experienced during 1916in regard to Greece, where we had recognised the de facto Govern-ment of King Constantine in that part of Greece in which he wasde facto ruler, while we had recognised M. Venizelos in another partof Greece. Although King Constantine had been guilty of un-friendly acts to ourselves and to our Allies, we had, by means of recognition, been enabled to give substantial help to the Venizelistswho remained under his rule. As regards the argument that, byaccording this partial recognition to the Bolshevik Government, weshould be discouraging our friends in Russia, he expressed theopinion that it had turned out that the Ukrainians, whom we hadregarded as our friends, had failed us. The only people in Russiawho could definitely be regarded as our friends were those who were willing to fight, not against: the Bolsheviks, but against the Austriansand Germans.Lord Robert Cecil feared that he held a different opinion Fromthat of the Prime Minister. He felt, that there had been a series ofmistakes in regard to our Russian policy during the past year. Wehad always tried to worship the rising sun. instead of standingfirmly in support of those elements in Russia who were friendly toBritish aims and to the cause of the Allies. He thought it wouldbe a fatal mistake to do anything which would dishearten the armenians, Poles, or Roumanians, and that we should gain nothingb\- attempting to conciliate our enemies. He thought it a great mistake to go hat in hand to the Bolsheviks at the time when theBolsheviks were making war upon our Allies the Roumanians.The Prime Minister agreed that it was most desirable that thedraft telegram to Mr. Lockhart should include definite instuctions in regard to the Roumanian point. .In regard, to the Polish question, the War Cabinet had beforethem a draft telegram from the Chief of the Imperial General staff to General Spiers, for delivery to General Foch, urging thedesirability that all Polish troops, together with the two CzechDivisions in the Ukraine, should be brought up on the right flank of the Roumanian Army, so as to oppose any enemy attempt to turn the latter by an advance north of the River Pruth.After discussion and amendment, the War Cabinet approved (a.) That the Foreign Office should send a reply to Mr. Lockhart,based on Mr. Balfour&apos;s draft, with the addition of Mr.Kerr&apos;s draft and the final passage of Lord Robert Cecilsdraft,(&amp;.) That the Chief of the Imperial G-eneral Staff should send to General Foch the Director of Military Intelligence^draft in regard to the Polish and Czech Divisions.Ee-assembling ofParliament :Consideration of draft of the King&apos;sySpeech. y12. The War Cabinet approved a Draft Speech, for submission to His Majesty the King and to the Privy Council, for delivery byHis -Majesty on the occasion of the opening of the next Session ofParliament,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,February 8, 1918;
