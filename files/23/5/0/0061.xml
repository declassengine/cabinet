The western front:Possible german attack.1. With reference to War Cabinet 367, Minute 4, the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff informed the War Cabinet that theGermans had commenced a. heavy bombardment that morning, ona front of 80 kilometres, from the Scarpe to the Oise.. This front of attack was in general accord with the one anticipated by the.British Staff at Versailles. The Chief of the Imperial GeneralStab&apos; was of opinion that this looked like the beginning of anattack on a large scale, although there was the possibility that itmight only develop into a big raid or demonstration. General. Wilson stated that we had 18 divisions in the front line in this sector, and 7 divisions in Army Reserves.Incendiary and 2.

The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that on the morning of the 20th instant a heavy under-water explosion was heard close to a drifter, between Folkestone and the Varne.     Subsequentlylarge quantities of oil were seen, and papers were picked up.   Itwas most probable that a submarine had been destro3^ed by the     &quot;\y deep mines.Detention of 4. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that, according to anBritish Ships in       intercepted commercial telegram, British ships in the Dutch EastDutch East Indies,    indies ports had stopped loading and were being detained.   Therey was no news of the detention of any British ships at Rotterdam.Requisitioning of dutch Shipping.5. With reference to War1Under-Secretary of State for ForeignCabinet 366, Minute 11 (c), the affairs stated that we wererequisitioning Dutch tonnage that day.It was suggested that, as Lord Robert Cecil was making a speech on the question of blockade that afternoon, he mightmention the fact that Dutch tonnage was being requisitioned.Loss of Mediter- 6.

With reference to War Cabinet 365, Minute 10, in replySea Fleet. to a question as to what steps were being taken by the Admiralty0 to prevent the Germans from capturing the Black Sea Fleet, theI 31/ Deputy First Sea Lord stated that the matter had been consideredW7&apos; /i by the Allied Naval Council     The Council had decided not totake immediate action, as it was thought that the Germans would find great difficulty in manning the ships.     The Germans had captured a few small naval ships at Odessa, but the greater partof the Russian Black Sea Fleet was at Sebastopol.The War Cabinet asked that The Admiralty should prepare a memorandum on the subjectof the Russian Black Sea Fleet, and the effect of its/&apos; possible capture by the Germans.
Removal of Storesfrom Vladivostock.1/8. Admiral Hope communicated to the War Cabinet a tele-gram received from the captain of H.M.S. &quot; Suffolk,&quot; stating that orders had been received from the Inspector of Artillery atHavarovsk to forward 45,000 rounds of 3-inch shell from th4Allied stores at Vladivostock. A strong protest was being made,but the captain of the &quot;&apos; Suffolk &quot; wished to know whether, in theevent of this protest being disregarded, forcible steps should betaken to prevent the removal of these munitions.There was some discussion as to the right of the Allies tointerfere with the disposal of stores which, even if not paid for,had in fact passed into the hands of the previous Russian Govem-ment, and, from them, to their de facto successors, and as to theprobable destination of the ammunition. With regard to thelatter point, the War Cabinet concluded that the ammunition was almost certainly meant for the forcible propagation of Bolshevismin Eastern Siberia, and would be used against moderate elements,such as Captain Semenolf, whom we ourselves were arming andpaying.. The War Cabinet decided that A telegram should be sent by the Admiralty to the captain ofH.M.S. &quot;Suffolk.&quot; expressing the view that the storesshould not be removed, and instructing him to concert with the Allied commanders as to how the removal could best be prevented.Russia :japanese intervention.?7j9. With reference to War Cabinet 366, Minute 12 (a), theWar Cabinet discussed the general question of Japanese inter-vention in Siberia, more particularly in connection with the memo-randum of enquiry from the Japanese Government (Sir C. Greene.No. 2(51). In this memorandum the Japanese Government raisedtwo questions: (a ) Whether they could have an assurance from HisMajesty&apos;s Government that Japan would have the moral and material support of the United States inintervening in Russia(&amp;.) Whether His Majesty&apos;s Government wished for anexplicit declaration on the part of Japan that she was,q. prepared to go as far as Cbeiiabinsk. or at least as faras Omsk.The general view of the War Cabinet was that japanese intervention would not be of any real use unless it extendedsufficiently far to deny the very large resources of Western Siberiato the Germans. The case for intervention was. in fact, that therewere large supplies actually available at this moment in WesternSiberia, which might be of very great importance to the Germansif, as all the evidence seemed to show, they were not likely to getsufficient relief to their food situation from the Ukraine and european Russia generally during the next few months.It was also urged that to leave Western Siberia open to theenemy would completely uncover Turkestan and so largelyfrustrate our efforts to prevent a German advance eastwardthrough Persia. There was also the possibility that japanese intervention might have a considerable moral effect upon publicopinion in the Central Empires. Doubts about the wisdom of theterms of peace extorted from Russia would be reinforced by the thought that this had brought into the scale against them thewhole strength of the country, whose military resources were probably exaggerated by them, and involve them in a new inter-minable series of operations in the East.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff suggested that therewere really two problems, that of Europe and that of Siberia.There was no question of getting Japanese troops to Moscow, nor,
on the other- hand, one of German regulars being able to get to vladivostock, or of  interfering   with  Japanese operations in siberia, If the Germans once secured control of Siberia, their influence would extend south into Turkestan, and. our whole position in India, would be imperilled. The problem was, in fact,part of the same problem as that raised by the danger to Persia.It was a question of pulling Siberia out of the wreck, in orderto save India.It was contended, on the other hand, that these were argu-ments of despair, frankly involving the abandonment of european russia to the Germans and denying the possibility of the Bol-sheviks putting up any effective resistance to the Germans, inspite of their recent declarations that they meant to renew thewar with all their might. It was urged that Japanese interven-tion would not only definitely alienate the Bolsheviks, but would throw on the side of Germany all the elements of law and orderin European Russia. It was admitted that the real question was whether there was any prospect of the. Bolsheviks really making good their intentions of renewing the contest.In this connection the War Cabinet considered Mr. Lock-hart&apos;s recent telegrams, and a speech made by M; Trotzki in whichhe declared himself in favour of drastic discipline in the armyand the abolition of the election of officers.It was suggested that M. Trotzki&apos;s action was mainly aimed at trying to prevent Japanese intervention. The success of theBolsheviks had lain throughout in the very fact that they were for peace at any price, and, although it was true that the anti-Rolshevik forces which we had previously attempted to organisefor the defence of Russia, against Germany had failed us, therewas nothing to show that the Bolsheviks were either able ordetermined to renew the war with Germany.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said it was fantasticto think that Trotzki or anyone else in Russia could put up a fight against the Germans.General Smuts concurred in this view, in so far as it was aquestion of meeting a great Germany army. On the other hand,if the revolution had any real spirit in it on which point therewas no material for arriving at a sound conclusion it might, ifseriously bent on resistance, cause great embarrassment to theGermans.It was suggested that the War Cabinet might with advantagehear the views of General Poole, who was due to arrive on the 22ndinstant.With regard to the actual enquiry raised in Sir C. Greene&apos;telegram No. 261, the War Cabinet felt that it was not possible toindicate to the Japanese our belief that the Americans would, infact, lend moral and material support, unless an assurance to that effect, or at any rate an assurance of benevolent neutrality towardsintervention, had first been secured from President Wilson.ft was pointed out that, although the Japanese penetration of Siberia might prove easy in the first instance, formidable dim-cnlties might arise later, with which Japan could only cope if she could rely upon the assistance in money and supplies which couldbe furnished by the United States.It was felt that the only thing that could be done was to renew the effort to persuade President Wilson of the necessity of inter-vention, drawing his attention to the most recent information, inorder to convince him that a situation was in fact rapidly arisingwhich, as he had suggested in his latest interview with Lord Read-ing, might cause him to modify his previous attitude. As the effort in this direction would be simply following out the policyalready decided upon in concert with the other Allies at a recent meeting, there was no reason for communicating further withthem.
General Policyin Persia.-     /.The EasternCommittee.1.0. With reference to War Cabinet 366, Minute 9, theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave an outline of the situa-tioh brought about in Persia by the collapse of Russia. In north persia, which had been the Russian sphere, there was now no dis--ei]dined force able to resist German and Turkish influences.Further, our access to Trans-Caucasia had been intercepted by un-ruly elements (Jangalis) in North-West Persia, together withBolsheviks; and our Mission under General Dunsterville. whichit had been hoped would be able to organise the Georgians andArmenians in resistance to the Turks, had been forced to turnback. The question of British intervention in North Persia hadbeen considered in the Persia Committee, but the view had pre-prevailed nnti] lately that it was not advisable to undertake so new and dangerous a venture.It was pointed out by Ford Curzon that we were then attempt-ing to work in harmony with the democrats in Teheran, who wouldhave been alienated by any action of that kind. Latterly, Mr.Balfour explained, the situation had grown so much worse that itwas clear some disciplined force must be sent into North-WestPersia, and it had been decided to despatch a force of some 1.300men, with armoured cars, into the country. This force, however,was held up by snow in the mountains, and meanwhile the powersof disorder beyond the passes were gathering momentum. Thegeneral situation might be regarded as potentially very serious.Persia was unable to be effectually neutral. Germany in controlof Trans-Caucasia, the Caspian and North Persia, would be a threat to India. The seriousness or imminence of this threat mightbe variously estimated, but the Persian situation was already of immediate concern to us.It was also pointed out. by Lord Curzon, that Sir PercySykes commanded in South Persia a force of some 5,000 or 6.000men. This force, known as the South Persian Rifles, was a kindof militia or gendarmerie. It was supported by a body of some.200 Indian regulars. The Persian Government had desired theremoval of this latter contingent, and we had been ready to con-cilia te them by complying, until the situation had grown so much worse. It was now a question of reinforcing these troops. our representative at Teheran had been consulted, and his reply wasawaited. The development of our force in South Persia, combined with an advance in North-West Persia, would place the capital,as it were, within a forceps, and might enable us to keep the enemyout of it, though lie was already reported to have emissaries inKasvin. Very small forces would suffice. We also had a cordonprotecting the Afghan frontier of Persia.The opinion was expressed that it was of great importance toreach the Caspian and to control it. Failing this, the enemy would gain unimpeded access to Turkestan, and outflank the landroute to India.11. With reference to War Cabinet 366, Minute 3, the WarCabinet, had under consideration a memorandum by Lord Curzon(Paper G.T.-3905), and a memorandum by Mr. Balfour (paper g.T.-3978).It was pointed out that, in view of the situation disclosed bythe discussion on Persia, the proposed Committee would have todeal with military even more than with diplomatic questions. Itshould be of the nature of a Vigilance Committee, ready to warn[1365-369]The War Cabinet requested The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to take action onthe lines of the above general conclusion.
Imperial WarCabinet:Representation ofIndia.12. Lord Islington drew the attention of the War Cabinet tothe question of the status of the Indian representatives at theforthcoming session of the Imperial War Cabinet. He pointedout that the statements made by the Prime Minister on the 16thMay, 1917, and by the then Secretary of State for India on the23rd May, 1917, indicated clearly that, at future annual meetingsof the Imperial Cabinet, a representative of the people of India,nominated by the Viceroy, was to attend the Imperial cabinet with the same status as the Dominion members of the imperial cabinet. These statements had been published broadcast in India,and there would be the greatest disappointment if there was any idea that the promise was being evaded in any way. The Viceroywas particularly anxious to be able to make an announcement tothat effect at the last meeting of bis Legislative Council on the22nd.Sir G. V. Fiddes explained that, in view of the wording of the reference to a. meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet in the recentKing&apos;s Speech, the Secretary of State for the Colonies understoodthat the forthcoming Cabinet would only be a continuation of the session held last year, and not a session of the Imperial cabinet referred to in the statement quoted. That being so, India would only be represented by the Secretary of State for India withAssessors, as on the last occasion.The War Cabinet were of opinion that the promise held out to India would certainly be taken in India to refer to the forth-coming meeting, whether technically described as an &quot; imperial war Cabinet &quot; or an &quot; Imperial Cabinet,&quot; and that if the ques-tion of status arose it should be made clear that the representativeof India was there as a member of the Imperial War Cabinet.Lord Islington also raised the question of the status of therepresentative of the Indian Native States. The Viceroy had suggested that such a representative should be added to theImperial War Cabinet as an additional member. If there were a.difficulty in acceding to this proposal, he suggested that a repre-sentative of the Native States should come over to take part as amember in the meetings of the Imperial Conference, and should attend meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet when invited by thePrime Minister.The War Cabinet accepted this suggestion, and did not con-sider that any difficulty with regard to status would arise in thisconnection. I        1 &apos;-v 1the War Cabinet and furnish advice on the Eastern area of operations.The &quot;War Cabinet decided that The Eastern Committee should supersede and absorb thefunctions of the Persia and Middle East Committee, andshould be composed of Lord curzon (Chairman),The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and/or his deputy,The Secretary of State for India,The Chief of the Imperial General Staff,General Smuts.Captain  E.   Abraham,   Assistant Secretary, WarCabinet (Secretary).The constitution and scope of the Committee as outlined in lord Curzon&apos;s memorandum (Paper G.T.-3905) were approved.
The War Cabinet requested Lord Islington to send a telegram to the Viceroy, stating thatBritish India would be represented at the meeting ofthe Imperial War Cabinet by an accredited member, andthat a representative of the Native States would take part in the meetings of the Imperial Conference, andwould attend meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet, onthe invitation of the Prime Minister, on the same footing as Ministers of the Dominions accompanying their PrimeMinisters.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March 21, 1918.
