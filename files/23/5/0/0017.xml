The War (Sabinetdid not under-rate the importance of a post bellum naval supremacy,but before taking a final decision they felt it was imperative toascertain the reaction of the naval proposals on other programmes of actual war construction.They, therefore, decided that Before sanctioning the Naval Programme for 1919, it wasnecessary that they should have before them particulars ofthe amount of the raw material and man-power required tobe accumulated for this Programme in 1918 and 1919, inorder that they might ascertain the effect it would have on the Programmes of other Departments.The First Lord of the Admiralty undertook to furnish the WarCabinet with these particulars.The War Cabinet approved certain anti-submarine measures proposed by the Admiralty, and authorised their execution.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,January 19, 1918.* Owing to its great secrecy this document haslnot been reproduced or circulated.
