The western front:Possible german attack.1. With reference to War Cabinet 363, Minute 3, the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff reported that an increased numberof dumps, a development of light railways, and signs of enemyconcentration in the area opposite to the line from Arras to St.Quentin, constituted the only additional evidence of an impendingGerman attack. The! Chief of the Imperial General staff explained the whole position on a map.M. Cambon was quoted as holding the view that the germans would not attack, their object being to depress the moral of thedefending force by a constant but deferred threat of an assaultin superior numbers.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff &quot;stated that he feltno certainty that an attack was coming, as it must depend uponwhether or not the Germans felt confident of their ability to defeat us in the field.Palestine.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported thatGeneral Allenby&apos;s advance had achieved its immediate objective,as designed for this stage of his operations.Co-operation ofFrench Forces.3. The question of the co-operation of French forces inPalestine was discussed, and it was decided that The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should undertaketo find a solution of this question in collaboration withGeneral Foch.Mesopotamia. 4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that our forces had advanced seven miles up-stream beyond Hit.Turkey:Distribution of forces.5. Attention was called to the apparent smallness of theTurkish forces in all the active theatres.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook to circu-late a statement of the present disposition of the Turkish forces.Russian Forces at 6. With reference to War Cabinet 353, Minute 6, the ChiefSalonica. of ^e Imperial General Staff drew attention to the necessity, in-z^. w^r/ the interest of discipline among the Allied forces in Salonica, of- removing  the  Russian troops from that area.     At present,according to a report from General Guillaumat, they wereattempting to corrupt the Serbians, and there was a danger thatthey might also demoralise the Greeks. As this was a questionof policy, General Wilson urged that the Prime Minister should discuss the question with M. Clemenceau.Submarines. 7. The Deputy First Sea Lord read a report from Newportthat the steamship &quot; Flixton &quot; had been attacked by an enemy submarine twenty miles east of Portland Bill. By use of thehelm the torpedo had been avoided, and the steamship &quot; Flixton &apos;&apos;had then made for the position of the submarine, which dived.A terrific explosion then took place, and no more was seen of thesubmarine. -The Deputy First Sea Lord also stated that the Rear-Admiral, Harwich Force, reported lhaving sunk a submarinesixty-five miles N.N.E. of Harwich on the 11th instant.     The
submarine was attacked by destroyers with depth charges, and\X wreckage was picked up.Supreme WarCouncil: Agenda.1Ar&apos;1/8. With reference to War Cabinet 359, Minute 14, the WarCabinet decided that The Secretary should confer with the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff, the Permanent Military Representatives,and the Versailles Secretariat, and prepare the agenda for the Supreme War Council.The War Cabinet further instructed The Secretary to prepare, for the Prime Minister&apos;s signature,a letter to each of the Allied Premiers with reference tolimiting the numbers present at the meetings of theSuoreme War Council.Questions to bediscussed at aPoliticalConference.   -y9. The War Cabinet requested The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to consider whatsubjects should be raised at a political conference to beheld during the presence in London of the statesmen ofthe Allied countries., Among such subjects would bethe question of -Japanese Intervention in Siberia.It was agreed that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should send aprivate telegram to Washington, to give an opportunityfor the selection of an American representative to be present at the discussions on foreign affairs.ltussia.japanese intervention.AmericanShipbuilding.y10. Attention was called to a message, published in the press,from President Wilson, expressing&apos; sympathy with the people ofRussia on the occasion of the opening of the Congress of Sovietsat Moscow.It was pointed out that this document did on behalf of theUnited States exactly what Mr. Lockhart had urged the BritishGovernment to do. The American public, however, had not thesame cause for resentment against Russia as the european allies, who had made great investments in Russia, and who hadbeen deserted in the midst of the struggle.11. With reference to War Cabinet 363, Minute 19, theattention of the War Cabinet was directed to telegram No. 74from Sir William Wiseman to Sir Eric Drummond, which indi-cated that hope should not be abandoned of another change in american policy on the subject of Japanese intervention in siberia.12. Mention was made of a Memorandum by Mr. Barnes(Paper G.T.-3869) on the subject of American labour employedin shipbuilding, and recommending that representations shouldbe made to Lord Reading, so that the methods successfully em-ployed in this country should be brought to the notice of both employers and employed.The War Cabinet decided that Mr. Barnes should draft a telegram containing the substance of this matter, to be transmitted by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs to Lord Reading.
13. With reference to War Cabinet 349, Minute 10, attention was drawn to a letter from Dr. Macnamara to the Secretary ofthe War Cabinet (Paper G.T.-3859) concerning the referenceto the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee of the question ofequalising the rates of separation allowance in the Navy and army. The letter stated that Sir Edward Carson would be willing, if invited by the War Cabinet, to continue to serve as chairman of this Committee.The War Cabinet decided that Sir Edward Carson should be invited by the Secretary of theWar Cabinet to do so.14. The War Cabinet had before, them a Memorandum bythe Secretary for Scotland on revolutionary agitation in Glasgowand Clydeside, with special reference to the cases of JohnMacLean and others (Paper G.T.-3838).Mr.&apos; Munro explained that John MacLean was a ticket-of-leave man who had been sentenced in 1918 to three years&apos; penal servitude. He had been liberated because of the state of his health, on condition that he should report himself to the policefrom time to time by letter. For a time he had kept quiet, but now he had made a number of speeches in Glasgow and in Fifewhich contravened the Defence of the Realm Act. He had recently been appointed &quot;Russian Consul&quot; in Glasgow byLitvinoff, and he had applied to be exempted from the require-ment to report to the police. He (Mr. Munro) raid the lord advocate had considerable hesitation in prosecuting him. Hewas more or less a lunatic; imprisonment would lead to his ill-health and to demands for his release, and it would, moreover, bedifficult to proceed against him alone, as he would pose as avictim. In any case, he had felt it necessary to obtain theapproval of the War Cabinet to the course to be adopted, as political considerations might be involved.Sir Spencer Ewart, Commanding-in-Chief Scottish Com-mand, Mr. Munro said, was in favour of taking proceedings against John MacLean, James McDougall, and Lewis Shammas.The Lord Advocate stated that there was very little atpresent to justify proceedings against McDougall. Shammaswas a Russian revolutionary whom MacLean had appointed ashis Consular Assistant, and whom it would be possible to deport.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that theForeign Office would offer no opposition to his deportation, nor to the prosecution of MacLean.Mr. Herbert Fisher said that he learned from a reliableFrench source that there was an intimate connection between themore extreme Labour leaders in Glasgow and similar Labourleaders at St. Etienne. The latter were taking instructions fromGlasgow. His correspondent, who had visited Glasgow, hadureed the necessity of a generous housing policy as a solvent ofindustrial unrest.The Attorney-General said that, on the facts, it seemed tohim a prosecution would be justified.The War Cabinet authorised -Proceedings to be taken in any case where the Lord Advocatewas of opinion that conviction would be probable.
Housing Policy. 15. With reference to War Cabinet 194, Minute 1, the WarCabinet had before them the following memoranda dealing withthe housing of the working-classes after the war: G.T.-3617 by Mr. Hayes Fisher,G.T.-3665 by Mr. R. Munro,G.T.-3682 by Mr. Duke,G.T.-3693 by Mr. Barnes,G.T.-3724 by Mr. Prothero,G.T.-3803 by Dr. Addison,G.T.-3877 by Dr. Addison,G.T.-3876 by Lord Salisbury.G.T.-3911 by Dr. Addison.Mr. Hayes Fisher reminded the War Cabinet that on the24th July they had authorised the issue of a circular, promisingsubstantial financial assistance from public funds to those LocalAuthorities who would be prepared to carry through withoutdelay, at the conclusion of the war, a programme of housing forthe working-classes approved by the Local Government Board.He had been pressed for some time by the Local Authorities tomake this promise more specific and detailed, and he now askeuthe War Cabinet to sanction the issue of the circular which hehad set forth as an Appendix to his Memorandum (Paper G.T.-3617) and the introducing of his small Bill for conferring powers in connection with housing upon County Councils. A great dealof preliminary work would have to be done if a housing programme were to be launched on the conclusion of peace.Some 1,800 authorities would have to secure options on land,prepare estimates of cost and balance sheet, and concludefinancial arrangements with the Local Government Board. he proposed that the State should enter into a partnership withthe Local Authorities for the provision of the houses, and the lords of the Treasury had agreed that the necessary state assistance should be given in the form of a grant of a percentageof the loan charges, sufficient to relieve the authority of 75 percent, of the estimated annual deficit. In special cases, where a burden of even 25 per cent, on the Local Authority might provesomewhat heavy, the Treasury had agreed that the Local Govern-ment Board should have discretion to increase the grant from &apos;75 per cent, to 100 per cent., less the produce of a rate of a pennyin the pound. It was true that the Treasury&apos;s offer was subjectto the financial exigencies of the State at the end of the war, butthe Local Authorities could be told that those who applied first would be helped first, so long as any money available lasted.Mr. Munro said he wished to support the policy outlined byMr. Hayes Fisher. He was being pressed by his Scottishcolleagues to approach the Minister of Reconstruction with aview to setting up a Reconstruction Committee on Scottish Hous-ing. That would involve further delay; but if the proposedcircular were immediately issued, the public demand would bemet, and the Committee would be unnecessary.Dr. Addison said he wished to offer a number of seriouscriticisms of the Local Government Board&apos;s policy. Fie was very doubtful whether, if that policy were adopted, the houses wouldbe forthcoming in anything approaching the number required.He strongly objected to Sections 5 and 6 of the proposed circular,according to which the Treasury retained the right of grantinglittle or no assistance to a big housing policy. To issue a circularof the kind proposed, and to couple with it such a reservation,would profoundly discourage the Local Authorities. For thesetwo sections there should be substituted, as an incentive&apos; to theLocal Authorities, a specific undertaking that the Treasury willfinance a scheme certified by the Local Government Board asurgently required. In the next place, inasmuch as the schemes[1365-364] C
of some authorities would be inadequate, power should be takento require such authorities to deal with the situation. There didnot appear to be adequate machinery for dealing with inertor recalcitrant authorities. Thirdly, the inflation in buildingcosts, clearly attributable to the war, should be a national charge.This amount could be determined by taking the actual cost andthe normal post-war cost of building, ascertained by a valuationafter a period of, say, five or seven years. Fourthly, if a reallycomprehensive scheme, adequate to the needs of the country and.to the expectations which had been raised, were to be undertaken,it was essential to strengthen the staff of the Local GovernmentBoard and to provide for some decentralisation by the appoint-ment of responsible officers empowered to settle schemes on the spot with the Local Authorities. Lastly, in view of the magnitude-tude of the State grant, the Government should have some controlover the level of rents imposed by the Local Authorities.Lord Salisbury thought that the principle of &quot; first come,first served&quot; was a wrong one. The proper criterion to applywas the urgency of the need. The Housing Committee over whichhe presided had put foiwvard the figure of 300,000 houses for england and Wales, as a conservative estimate. It was better to look at the problem as a whole from the beginning than toimagine it to be possible to build the first 150,000 on one set of conditions and the second 150,000 on some other and less favourable conditions. It was most necessary to dead withauthorities, which might have the worst houses, and which wouldbe most reluctant to build. It was true that the throwing of 25per cent, on the Local Authority would be an inducement toeconomical administration, but when they came to grips with thecase of the poorer authorities, this inducement would disappearwith the penny rate as a fixed limit. He agreed with what Dr.Addison had said about the need for local machinery.Mr. Hayes Fisher said he believed the larger municipalitieswould be willing to shoulder a part of the burden. He was infavour of gradually developing- the machinery of decentralisation,but he did not wish at this stage to stimulate criticism in theHouse of Commons by creating a number of highly-paidofficials with local staffs and offices. The urgent need at themoment was the issue of the circular, so that the Councils might,get on with the preparation of their plans and estimates. TheBill which he had drafted gave power to the Local GovernmentBoard to put County Councils in motion wdrere the smallerAuthorities were inert.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed with Lord Salisburythat, subject to the financial situation,&apos; the right principle wasthat of local need. On the question of inflated building costs, itwas true that they were due to the war, but it was also true thatthe war had put heavier burdens on the tax-payers than on therate-payers. The tax-payers had to bear the burden of theNational Debt. It was bad finance to make the tax-payers beara larger proportion of local burdens than in the past, especiallyin the cases where there were rich rate-payers capable of bearingthem. On the question of the indefiniteness of the language ofthe Treasury, he agreed with Dr. Addison that it was undesirable to suggest that there would be no money available. On the otherhand, he would be most unwilling to pledge the Government tofind the large sum contemplated immediately after the war. Therewould be at that time the keenest competition for money, and itwould be most unwise for the Treasury to enter into obligationsnow to raise large loans at the end of the war. He suggested, inorder to go some way to meet Dr. Addisorfs criticism, that section 5 of the draft circular should be omitted.It was generally agreed that the force of some of the maincriticisms made during the discussion would best be tested by theissue of the circular to the Local Authorities.   It would then be
discovered how far they were prepared to take action on thestrength of the Treasury&apos;s conditional promise, it being under-stood that if the result appeared to be inadequate it might thenbe necessary to issue an undertaking of a more definite kind, as suggested by the Minister of Reconstruction. Many amend-ments would also doubtless be suggested when the Housing bill was before the House of Commons.It was also -pointed out that, in developing our schemes of reconstruction, we might be led to consider the system of Prefetsin force in France.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To authorise the President of the Local GovernmentBoard to issue the proposed circular to LocalAuthorities in England and Wales, with the omission of Section 5, also that the supervisory power of theCentral Department as to the rents to be chargedduring the transition period for State-assisted houses(which the President of the Local Government Boardsaid was involved in paragraph. 10 of the Treasuryletter) should be made explicit&quot;.(6.) To authorise the Secretary for Scotland to issue asimilar circular for Scotland.(c.) To request the President of the Local Government board to circulate his Flousing Bill to the War cabinet before introducing it in the House of Commons, whenthe Minister of Reconstruction would have an oppor-tunity of raising the points of criticism indicated bvhim that day.18. With reference to War Cabinet 323, Minute 12. theWar Cabinet had before them the draft of a Bill dealing withMaternity and Child Welfare, as amended by the Committee ofMinisters to whom it had been referred (Paper G.T.-3830),together with a note by the President of the Local GovernmentBoard, and also a note bv the Minister of Reconstruction (paper g.T.-3884).Mr. Long said that the Bill was in the form in which it was accepted by the Committee of Ministers. He added that the bill was very badly wanted, and that the Government was beingseverely criticised for the delay in introducing it.Sir Edwin Cornwall said he wras not in a position to say thatthere would not be controversy in the House of Commons over theproposed Bill. There might be difficulties, but he was preparedto do what he could to meet them.Dr. Addison felt certain there, would be opposition in theHouse of Commons from those wdio thought that the Governmentwere trying to play this Bill off against the demand for a Ministryof Health. He had proceeded so far with the negotiations for theestablishment for a Ministry of Health that he hoped to be able,to submit substantially agreed proposals on the subject to the WarCabinet in a week or two.. The introduction of the maternity and Child Welfare Bill now might prejudice the negotiations hewas conducting.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To authorise the President of the Local GovernmentBoard to introduce the Maternity and Child Welfarer BilL(&amp;.) To announce that this Bill was not to be regarded as inany way prejudicing the GovernmenCs intention tointroduce legislation as speedily as possible for theestablishment of a Ministry of Health.
17. With reference to War Cabinet 347, Minute 8, the WarCabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Food. Controller(Paper G.T.-3745), in which he asked that the War cabinet should reconsider their previous decision that the sugar rationshould be reduced from 8 oz. to 6 oz. per head per week..Sir Charles Bathurst, who represented Lord Bhondda, statedthat the maintenance of the sugar ration at its present rate wouldnot require any more tonnage being allocated by the Ministry ofShipping. All he asked was that the decision to reduce the sugar ration should be postponed until after the soft-fruit season.This would enable private households, including especially thosewho bought fruit for jam-making, to save sugar for the firstjam-making out of their present ration. The Ministry of Foodhad already placed on one side 210,000 tons of sugar for the jamfactories, and a further 10,000 to 12,000 tons was being held in reserve for the private growers. Sir Charles Bathurst added thatit was the intention of the Food Controller to allow sugar to the domestic fruit-grower to provide 10 lb. per head, any additionaljam to go to the common stock. The Food Committees couldexceed this allowance in special cases. The domestic rationshowed a prospective reduction in consumption at the rate of atleast 20,000 tons per annum, and mainly owing to the alteration in the ration to the Home Forces during the last two months,there appeared likely to be a reduction in the demands of the WarOffice at the rate of 40,000 tons per annum. Further, theDepartment had budgeted on last season&apos;s fruit crop, which wasa very good one, and as this year&apos;s crop would probably be lessthere might be a saving of some 20,000 tons under that head. Bythese arrangements and other economies it was hoped to save89,000 tons as compared with last year. Sir Charles Bathurstpointed out that the proposed reduction in tonnage for sugar of150,000 tons represented a greater reduction in the domesticration than, the 2 oz. intended, as a margin had to be&apos; allowed forlosses in carriage and distribution.Mr. Beveridge said, that there had been a considerable increase in pulping and canning machinery for fruit preservationthis year, which Sir Charles Bathurst estimated at double the capacity of last year.The War Cabinet decided that The reduction of the sugar&apos;&quot;ration should be postponed untilthe end of the first fruit season, provided that this post-ponement would not necessitate a further demand on the- Ministry of Shipping for more tonnage.18. In accordance with the decision of the War Cabinet ofthe 2Sth November, 1917 (War Cabinet 285, Minute 14), lord rhondda asked for the approval of the War Cabinet to a redraftof the Bill which he had made in order to meet the objection ofthe Solicitor-General that the original draft did not prevent theoriginal consignee from going to the Defence of the Realm LossesCommission and applying for compensation.Mr. Beveridge, who represented Lord Rhondda, stated thatthe Solicitor-General had approved the re-drafted Bill.The War Cabinet approved the re-draft of the Bill submittedby Lord Rhondda.19. With rererence to War Cabinet 356, Minute 13, the WarCabinet decided that the &quot;War Cabinet Report for the year1917 &quot;should be published without the signature of any memberof the War Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.March 12, 1918.
