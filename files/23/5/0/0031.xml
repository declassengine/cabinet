Submarines. 1. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that anenemy submarine had been sunk in the Straits of Dover by the/destroyer &quot; Zubian.&quot;2. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the First Lord of the Admiralty (Paper G.T.-3495), relative tothe guarantee of a safe-conduct to Russian vessels back to Murmanskif such vessels were allowed to leave that port for England.The Shipping Controller stated that the guarantee had only been given for two Russian vessels.The War Cabinet therefore decided that It was not necessary to take further action unless the question were again brought Tip by the First Lord.Mr. Barnes drew the attention of the War Cabinet to a DraftInstruction to Departments (Paper G.T.-3519) on the subject of wage increases, and stated that exception had been taken, by SirLynden Macassey, to the inclusion therein of a letter from theAdmiralty (Shipyard Labour) Department. Mr. Barnes pointed outthat many more illustrations of the actions of Departments in thisrespect could be furnished, but that the one in question was particularly appropriate, inasmuch as it had been used by thesheet-metal workers in connection with their recent strike.The view was expressed that, as the letter as it stood did not give a complete history of the case, it was undesirable to promulgatethe same, and Mr. Barnes was accordingly requested to amend theDraft Instruction as requisite.The War Cabinet directed-The Secretary to promulgate to the Departments concerned the amended Instruction.Man-Power: 4. With reference to War Cabinet 3$7, Minute 1, Sir AucklandThe Position of Geddes said that, in his opinion, the position was less likely tothe Amalgamated produce serious trouble than seemed probable a few days   ago.Society of During the last few days he had seen representatives of various UnionsEngineers. (other than the Amalgamated Society of Engineers) and found thatthey were becoming favourable to a Conference at which they couldA, ^       . reconsider   their   relations   with   the   Amalgamated   Society   ofIa7-&apos;       &apos; Engineers.    On  the  whole,   he   thought  the   result  of such  aConference would be an expression of readiness to be present, with awatching brief only, at a meeting between representatives of theGovernment and the A.S.E. Difficulties, however, would certainlyemerge later around the definition of &quot;dilutee.&quot; If an agreementbetween the Amalgamated Society of Engineeers and the other unions especially the Workers&apos; Union could be reached on themeaning of &quot; dilutee,&quot; the most serious source of trouble would be over.The engineers had utilised their privileged position to absorb into theirSociety members from the unskilled Unions. These unskilledUnions wished to confine the meaning of &quot; dilutee&quot; to those whowere not working in or about engineering works before the war. Itwould not be possible to agree to the claim of the engineers that all&quot; dilutees&quot; should be taken first. The effect of doing so would be most seriously to hamper pr-oduction. It would also be unjust, because it would discriminate unfavourably against older members of the unskilled Unions. Further, there were great variations in thepercentage of &quot; dilutees &quot; employed in different shops and by differentfirms. For that reason it was impossible to take any larger unit thana firm as the unit for recruiting. Certain minor complaints put forward by the engineers were due to misunderstanding. For example, it was provided in the Schedule that the men should only be called up by theSafe-Conduct ofEussian Vessels to murmansk.Instructions to departments onthe Subject of wage Increases.
Recruiting Officer of the Munitions Area. The other Unions were sending manifestos to cheir men, requesting them on no account tocome out on strike. He (Sir Auckland Geddes) was certain that thepresent conflict had had the effect of increasing the support obtained by the Government from these other Unions. He proposed therefore to summon representatives of all the Unions previously invited to afurther Conference, at which the press should be present, and toendeavour to arrange that representatives of the other Unions shouldbe present with a watching brief at a further Conference betweenthe engineers and the -Ministry of National Service. He thought there would he agreement as to the holding of the meeting, but,beyond that, he did not think there would be agreement. In themeantime, the delay in meeting the engineers was making no difference to the supply of recruits to the army. The RevisedSchedule of Protected Occupations had already come into operation.Sir Stephenson Kent said that he thought that at some period or other it would be necessary for the Government to meet the engineers. He thought the procedure indicated by the Minister ofNational Service was sound. It was important that there should be considerable publicity given to the proceedings of the Conference.The Government must be prepared to find the engineers coming tothe Conference with impracticable terms.Mr. Churchill said that a number of engineers were nowvolunteering. It should be possible to obtahi from the greatmunition areas a stream of resolutions in favour of the vigorousprosecution of the war. Such resolutions should appear in increasing numbers day by day in the newspapers for at least a fortnight.They would have a marked effect on the disaffected elements. Whilemuch could thus be done by way of propaganda, it must not be forgotten that the engineers could Daralvse every munitions industry for a tune, hut, fortunately, there were sufficient reserves to standa short strike. It was necessary to consider in advance what steps should be taken in the face of a general dislocation of industry, ftwas most important that, should a trial of strength with the engineers take place, it should not be complicated by other issues,such as the shortage of food. It would be far better, during the critical weeks of the struggle, to draw on any available reserves offood. He was in favour of a small Special Committee being set up toprepare for emergencies.Sir David Shackleton was in favour of holding the proposed conference with the other unions, and of avowing its object, butonly in the most general terms. It was desirable to preventdelegates arriving at the Conference already pledged by the votes oftheir executives against reopening negotiations with the engineers.Mr. G. H. Roberts was in favour of the Conference. Shouldtrouble arise later on, care should be taken not to provoke popularopposition by a threat to employ soldiers.Lord Derby said that soldiers would only be used in the verylast resort. He would prefer, in case of any impending conflict, toremove the soldiers from the shops into camps. In any case, thesoldiers would only be used at the invitation of the Home Secretary.Sir Alan Anderson said that on the Clyde there was a smallknot of dangerous men, and a large crowd who were disgruntled.The best way of dealing with the latter was by improving the food situation.The War Cabinet (a.) Approved the proposal of the Minister of National service to hold a Conference with certain trade unions ;and decided that (b.) The following Committee should be appointed to considerthe steps to be taken in the event of serious industrial[1365--339]     &apos; B 2
istrouble arising in connection with the attitude ot the engineers to the Governments man-power measures : Sir George Gave (Chairman),together with representatives of the following Depart-ments : The War Office,The Admiralty.The Ministry of National Service,The Ministry of Munitions,The Local Government Board,The Ministry of Labour,The Ministry of Food.Imprisonment ofBritish Airmen inGermany forDroppingPamphlets.o.The War Cabinet took note of the despatch by the ForeignOffice of telegram No. 292, elated the 4th February, 1918, givingnotice to the German Government that, unless Second LieutenantsScholtz and Wookey, R.F.C., were released from prison, reprisalswould be taken by^ His Majesty&apos;s Government.Timber for france.6. The War Cabinet had before them a copy of a letter from theSecretary, War Office, in regard to the shipment of timber to France(Paper G.T.-3523).Lord Derby explained that a sudden and very urgent demandfor timber to allow deep dug-outs to be made, before any heavy attack could be made on us, had been received from General Head-quarters, France. This new demand amounted to 24,000 tons dead-weight.The Shipping Controller said that, in view of recent increased demands upon tonnage, he suggested that the shipment of otherArmy stores destined for France should be reduced proportionatelyin order to make room for the timber.Attention was called to the reserves&apos; of ammunition that hadbeeu built up in France, and it was suggested that the flow ofammunition might now be reduced temporarily, and the timbershipped iu its place.The Master-General of the Ordnance undertook so to arrangehis shipments of stores to France that the 24,000 tons of timber should be carried during February and March.Sir Albert Stanley said that the question was not exclusivelyone of tonnage. The shipment of this timber, which would bedrawn from stocks iu this country, already at a low point, would still further reduce our supplies that were required for Governmentpurposes at home, and the stocks would have to be replaced later bypurchases from Sweden.The Master-General of the Ordnance said that the shipmentnow proposed was only a temporary one to meet an emergency, andhe hoped that later on, owing to the steps taken by Lord Lovat toincrease bis supplies in France, it would be possible gradually toreplace the shipment now drawn from the stocks in this country.Inter-allied council onTonnage and imports:british representatives.7. With reference to War Cabinet 319, Minute S, the WarCabinet   had   before   them a   memorandum by  the Ministry ofShipping (Paper G.T.-3470) in regard to the appointment of british representatives on the Inter-Allied Transport Council.The Shipping Controller asked the War Cabinet for a decision in regard to the appointment of another Minister to serve in additionto himself.
At the request of the War Cabinet Lord Robert Cecil undertook to act with the Shipping Con-y  troller on the Council.8. With reference to War Cabinet 337, Minute 3, the WarCabinet discussed what should be the attitude of the Governmentin the House of Commons towards the amendment of the Repre-sentation of the People Biil carried in the House of Lords. various alternatives were discussed and compromises suggested with a viewto saving the Bill.    Among these were :-(a.) The acceptance of the Lords&apos; amendment, with a proviso that, if 5,000 electors should within thirty days petitionthat Proportional Representation should not apply totheir constituency, the election should take place in theordinary form;(b.) The limitation of Proportional Representation to smallboroughs returning not less than three and not morethan five members;(c.) The return by Proportional Representation of not morethan 100 members of Parliament from boroughs andcounties selected after local enquiry by a Commission.It was suggested that a very restricted experimental applicationof Proportional Representation would tend to discredit the principle without giving it a fair trial.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The best course would be for the House of Commons to reject the Lords&apos; amendment in favour of proportional representation, but to accept it in respect to the exclusion of the Alternative Vote ;(6.) If  necessary,  there should   be   an   informal  Conference&quot;&apos; between Party leaders of both Houses.Representation ofthe People Bill:Attitude of theGovernment to the lords&apos; Amendment.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,February 5, 1918.
