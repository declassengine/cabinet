Turkish Prisoners.1. THE War Cabinet bad before them the Agreement reached between the delegates of the British and Ottoman Governments on italy:Italian Labour forthe Western Front.Bombardment ofYarmouth.&apos;together withthe subject of prisoners of war and civilian prisoners,a Memorandum by Lord Newton (Paper G.T.-3336).During the discussion Lord Newton indicated that theimpression prevailing among Turkish political agents at Berne, derivedfrom what they knew of the Entente political statements, was thatthe total destruction of the Turkish Empire was intended. In thisrespect the Prime Ministers last speech must have had a beneficial effect.The Secretary of State for War stated that he felt somemisgiving as to the undertaking that Eyoub Sabri, who was a friend of Talaat and a very prominent member of the Committee of union and Progress, should be included in the first batch of prisoners.It was pointed out that any departure from this understanding mightbe regarded as a breach of faith, and that it had been intimated on good authority that Eyoub Sabri:s influence might possibly be utilised, when he was repatriated, against Enver.The War Cabinet decided- (a.) That the Foreign Office should ratify the Agreement onthe part of the British Government.That no announcement should be made until the TurkishGovernment had also ratified the Agreement.To place on  record their thanks to Lord Newton  andGeneral   Belfield   for   the   successful   issue   of  their negotiations.(6.)(c.)/2. With reference to War Cabinet 282, Minute 2, the WarCabinet adverted to a proposal, contained in the Draft Report of theCabinet Committee on Man-Power, that some assistance in the formof man-power should be obtained from Italy, in return for theassistance given by the Allies. It was uiged that the request formen to work behind our lines in France should be put forward on thebasis of a quid pro quo for the troops, guns, shhps, coal, and wheatsupplied to Italy by this country.In connection with this question, it was stated that, althoughItaly had great reserves of men, her internal situation was such asto give great cause for anxiety. It was suggested that the best wayof removing this condition, and of establishing a solid claim to Italiangratitude hereafter, would be to furnish the Italian Governmentwith the means of improving the pay and separation allowances ofthe Italian soldiers.Lord Milner undertook to go into the question on behalf of theWar Cabinet, with a view to the formulation of a definitescheme as a basis for negotiation with the Italian Govern-ment.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported thatYarmouth had been bombarded from the sea for five minutes on theprevious evening. About twenty shells of 4-inch calibre were reported to have fallen in the town. The casualties reported up tothe present were : Killed : 2 men, 1 woman.   Injured : 5 men, 4 women, 1 child.Four houses were badly damaged. The Town Hall, some maltingbuildings, and some sixteen dwelling-houses were slightly damaged.The First Sea Lord stated that the vessels which bombardedYarmouth were reported to be four destroyers. The Rear-Admiralof the Harwich force had immediately been informed and instructedto send out one light cruiser and four destroyers, but this force had returned without sighting the enemy. The Vice-Admiral, Dover, andthe Commander in-Chief at the Nore were also informed. news from this side had not yet been received.
daTransfer of divisions.Enemy4. With reference to War Cabinet 321, Minute 1, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff reported that, according- to information from the agents of the Russian General Staff, a continuous transferof troops, in the form of odd units, was taking place from the german forces on the Eastern front to the West. The transfer of german troops to France from Italy was also proceeding, and it wasconsidered that a large part of Von Below&apos;s army had beentransferred to the Western front. This General, who had commandedin Italy, was now known to have a Command in France. Therewere now known to be 164 German divisions on the western front, and the probable number was 166, if not 170. The. Chief of the Imperial General Staff also stated that Austrianartillery was being moved to Flanders.German Offensiveoa the western front.5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that information derived from Russia was to the effect that a german offensive on the Western front would not take place for several months, but that it would occur in any case before America could give effective aid. The main offensive would be in Flanders, andwould be accompanied by a demonstration in the South.In this connection there was information from Copenhagen thatthe German General Staff had renounced its intention of animmediate offensive on the Western front owing to the difficulty ofthe internal situation in Germany and the bad weather.Mutiny in the 6. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that from theGerman Navy. same source came a report that fresh mutinies had taken place willhelmshaven and Kiel, and that attempts had been made against*S the lives of officers.The Balkan Front: 7. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to telegramBulgaria. No. 22 from Berne, suggesting the probability of an attack by thefm Bulgarian army on the Balkan front.3 The Chief of the Imperial General Staff pointed out that Bernewas not a particularly good source of information, and that therewas no confirmation of this intelligence. Nevertheless, he did notconsider the rumoured attack at all improbable.The Secretary of State for War stated that our troops were fairly well up to strength, but, as the War Cabinet had already beeninformed, many of the troops were seriously weakened by malaria.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should ascertain,for the information of the War Cabinet, from thePermanent Military Advisers at Versailles, or other sources, to what extent the French troops had beenbrought up to strength.-^/G^^f^lj, x (6.) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should ascertainjLx^-wc^-&apos;. ^t4^ General Milne&apos;s opinion of General Guillaumat, the new^ &apos; ^ frf//    ,   French Commander-in-Chief at Salonica.Loss of H.M.S. 8. With reference to War Cabinet 321, Minute 4, the First&quot; Opal&apos; Sea Lord stated that one survivor of the destroyer &quot; Opal&quot; had beeny picked up, but that he was in a bad condition.Submarines. 9. The First Sea Lord stated that at present there was onlyy   one German submarine operating in the English Channel.
---5-/Air-raid on 10. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that he hadKarlsruhe. nothing to add to the published information concerning the air-raidon Karlsruhe.It was pointed out that the communique did not attribute tothis raid the quality of a reprisal, although the adoption by theGovernment of a policy of reprisals had been announced. This kindof raid against such places as Karlsruhe and Stuttgart, wh chwidely from the bombing of open towns in Belgium differedconstituted an act of war against the enemy troops occupying them. \The War Cabinet decided that -In future the War Office, or other Department concerned,should arrange that official communiques in regard to air-raids of this nature should mention that they were undertaken as a measure of reprisal.Supreme WarCouncil:11. The War Cabinet had under consideration Joint Note No. 5to the Supreme War Council, by its Military Representatives, on theJoint Note Na 5.     situation in Russia, and took note of the views expressed therein.Joint Note No. 7.12. The War Cabinet had under consideration Joint Note No. 7to the Supreme War Council, by its Military Representatives, on thequestion of aviation.General Trenchard pointed out that the situation was such atpresent, owing to the uncertain factor with regard to the output of american machines, that it was not practicable at the presentmoment to draw up any co-ordinated plans with a view, for instance,to the speedy creation of inter-Allied strategic formations and their employment, and that, if an attempt was made in this direction,plans would be unreliable and out of date very quickly. As regardsAmerica, the situation ought to be clearer by next July, and hesuggested that the appointment of any Inter-Allied Expert Com-mittee should be deferred until then. General Trenchax&apos;d suggestedthat the Military Representatives to the Supreme War Council shouldbe furnished with all the information that was available on thesubject of the air resources of the Allies, and that further information should be sent from time to time as it was forthcoming. He addedthat there were very few officers available who had an intimate knowledge of the air situation, and that if one of those was attachedto the Supreme War Council he would very soon be insufficientlyposted as regards the developments that took place from day today.Lord Rothermere endorsed the views of General Trenchard asregards the impossibility at present of getting anything definite as tothe output from America as regards aeroplanes, &amp;c, and pointed outthat as regards bombing plans the French were strongly opposed toany reprisals in this direction ; further, that bombing arrangements in themselves were not difficult to co-ordinate.The War Cabinet were of opinion that, although the Air co-ordination to its fullest extent was not at the present momentpracticable, yet it was highly desirable that each section of theSupreme YvTar Council should have attached to its staff an officer whohad considerable knowledge of the Air organisation, &amp;c, and they therefore requested The Air Minister to arrange the appointment of such an officer,who should be changed from time to time, so that theMilitary Representatives to the Supreme War Council mightbe kept as fully informed as possible as to the possibilitiesof aerial attack and defence.
Joint Note No. 8.r.Joint Note No. 9.&quot;31/14. The War Cabinet had under consideration Joint Note No. to the Supreme War Council, by its Military Representative, on thesubject of Tanks.The War Cabinet approved the appointment of the Inter-AlliedExpert Committee as recommended by the Military Representatives,and requested The Secretary of State for War and the Minister of munitions to arrange for the appointment of a suitable officer.Joint Note No 10 ^&apos;ne War Cabinet had under  consideration  Joint note no. 10 to the Supreme War Council, by its Military Representa-tives, on the subject of the extension of the British front.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that, on thereceipt of a copy of this Note, he at once called upon Field-marshal sir Douglas Haig for any remarks that he might have to offer onthe subject, and they had just been received.The War Cabinet decided that 2 V/ 3*?3 . The report of  Field-Marshal   Sir Douglas Haig   should  be circulated, and the question again brought before theWar Cabinet at an early date.Machine-guns. 16- The Wai&apos; Cabinet directed-The  Secretary to  forward the   following  telegram  to  theMilitary Representatives to the Supreme War Council,yl    j, , Versailles: , &quot; In order to secure the advantage of the experience&apos; of other Allied armies, the Military Representatives at, ^ Versailles are requested to report as soon as possible on/ &quot;3  is the  economising  of man-power, casualties and tonnage,U^Twhich might be effected by the fullest and most scientific^&apos; employment of machine-guns,- automatic rifles, tanks, andy other mechanical devices.&quot;13. The War Cabinet had under consideration Joint Note No. 8to the Supreme War Council, by its Military Representatives, on thesubject of transportation.Lord Derby pointed out that the War Cabinet had already decided that General Nash should make enquiries into the transport-tation problem as it presented itself on the Western front, &amp;c.(War Cabinet 302, Minute 8), and it was highly undesirable, as GeneralNash had already started his investigations, to appoint an Inter-Allied Expert Committee to go into the question. He recommendedthat, before any action should be taken by the War Cabinet, theyshould receive General Nash&apos;s report on the subject.It was pointed out that the carrying out of this duty by GeneralNash had been approved by the French and Italian Governments,and that, moreover, Colonel House had agreed to the proposition.The War Cabinet decided that Before taking any further action on the recommendations setout in Joint Note No. 8, the report of General Nash shouldbe awaited, and that, on its receipt, a copy should be forwarded to the Military Representatives to the supreme war Council with a view to their putting forward, if con-sidered necessary, any further recommendations on thesubject.
GEussian Credit and 17. The Chancellor of the Exchequer brought to the notice of treasury Bills. the War Cabinet a Memorandum (Paper G.T.-3339) he had written on the subject of Russian Credit and Treasury Bills, in which it waspointed out that, as the Treasury were not willing in 1915 to make an advance for the purpose of keeping up the Russian exchange,that Department had suggested that the money should be taken up from the Bank of England, with the result that acceptances to theamount of 7,5OO,OO0L were arranged. It was now contended, andundoubtedly with truth, that this money was provided not in theordinary way of business, but in order to meet the wishes of theGovernment, and that therefore the Government should bear theliability. Although Mr. Bonar Law was unable to admit that wehad any legal liability, he did not consider that the whole of whateverloss had eventually been incurred should fall upon the Government,and he proposed, therefore, to make the best arrangements he could with the firms which had accepted these bills subject to the avoidance of any appearance of treating them meanly.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that there was also anamount of 10,000,OOOZ. of Russian Treasury Bills issued by the Bankof England on behalf of the Russian Government, in regard to whichit was stated in the prospectuses that the issue was made with theapproval of His Majesty&apos;s Government. He proposed to adopt thesame course in dealing with these.The War Cabinet approved the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;sproposals in these matters.Bolshevist 18. In connection with his Memorandum (Paper G.T.-3329) asPropaganda. to   recent   Bolshevist   propaganda,   Sir   George   Cave   requestedinstructions from the War Cabinet as to (a.) Whether a check should be put upon M. LitvinoiTs corre-0 spoudenoe, and whether he should be warned that if he1?     r, i pursues his propaganda it may be impossible to permit/ \ nim to remain in this country.(b.) Whether any newspaper publishing any further propagandaof the same nature should be vigorously dealt with byway of seizure or prosecution,(c.) Whether the Government preferred to rely upon counter-propaganda.Sir George Cave added that the Bolshevist propaganda, as nowcarried out, committed distinct breaches of the Defence of the realm regulations, and was of such a nature that, if similar action wastaken in enemy or Allied countries, it would immediately be stopped,and that in the past he had deported men from this country for less objectionable propaganda than that under consideration. He under-stood that M. Litvinoff had been invited to attend a Trade Unionmeeting at Nottingham in the near future, with a view to addressingthe delegates that would assemble there, and he (Sir George Cave)was of opinion that this Bolshevist agitation would have a bad effecton the people of Great Britain in general. He drew the attentionof the War Cabinet to the headings that appeared on the front pageof some of the Labour papers ; in the case of &quot; The Herald,&quot; therewas printed in large type &quot; A People&apos;s Peace Now or Never.&quot;The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed out that thedifficulty was that if M. Litvinoff was deported it would beimpossible to keep up our existing relations with the Bolsheviksin Petrograd, and he mentioned that the situation there at present was extremely critical, owing to the trouble which had arisen between the Diplomatic Corps and the Bolshevik Governmentrelative to the arrest of the Roumanian Minister. Mr. Balfoursaid that he had just received a telegram from Petrograd to the
effect that the whole of the Allied Diplomatic Corps in that cityhad recently made a most solemn protest against the arrest, andtiiat possibly the result would be that all the Diplomatic Corpswould have to leave.The question was raised as to whether the matter could betreated from the -point of view of giving M. Litvinoff all the privileges that are consistent with Diplomatic custom.The opinion was expressed that it was doubtful if the enemy propaganda was doing much real harm amongst the British people as a whole.The Minister of Pensions was of opinion that the suppression ofthe Labour papers would not have any bad effect, and instances werequoted of the stoppage of newspapers under the Defence of the realm Regulations in connection with propaganda, the form ofstoppage in one case being the refusal to supply paper for printingpurposes.Mr. Balfour suggested that, before taking any decision as regardsM. Litvinoff, he should consult our Allies as to what action theywould be prepared to take under similar circumstances, and shouldalso communicate with the British Charge dAffaires in Petrogradwith a view to obtaining an expression of his opinion as to the effect the deportation of M. Litvinoff would have on the BolshevikGovernment.The. War Cabinet decided That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should make the inquiries which he suggested, and the matter should bebrought up again at an early date.19. With reference to &quot;War Cabinet 279, Minute 9, the WarCabinet had under consideration memoranda by the Secretary ofState for War (Paper G.T.-3239) and by the Minister of Pensions(Paper G.T.-3239 a) as to the action to be taken in regard toinforming the relatives of men who had been shot for cowardice.Lord Derby informed the War Cabinet that he had carried outthe provisions of the &quot;War Cabinet decision (War Cabinet 279,Minute 9), but he thought that the form of communication as approved therein was a matter of mistaken kindness, as, by some means or another, at a later - date the relatives became acquainted with the reasons which led to the death of the men in question, andconsequently, according to the custom amongst the poorer classes,considerable expenses were incurred in connection with In Memoriamcards.Mr. Hodge endorsed this view, and recommended that theWar Cabinet decision referred to above should be reversed.It was pointed out, however, that the new procedure had been explained in Parliament, and had been accepted.Mr. Hodge pointed out various difficulties that he had to contend with in this connection, with regard to pensions or compas-sionate allowances for the wives and children, &amp;c., of the men underconsideration, as well as of those who lost their lives owing to lessheinous forms of misconduct.The view was generally held that, if a man&apos;s life was taken fordisciplinary reasons, the relatives should not be made to suffer.As regards the form of communication when men were shot foro m mcowardice, the War Cabinet decided To adhere to their previous decision.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,January 15, 1918.
