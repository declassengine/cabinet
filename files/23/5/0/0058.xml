The Western Front. 1. The  Chief  of the Imperial General Staff reported thatthere was no change on the-Western front, except that, during thelast half of February, 40 new heavy batteries of 1.60 guns, whichhad been moved from Russia, had been located. It had previously,y been calculated that 400 Jsateteiites a month would be moved.2. The Prime Minister stated that he had received a, letterfrom Mr. Solomon, the artist, who claimed that the Germancamouflage behind their lines was very complete, and that it hadtotally deceived us.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that, withdaily photography, he was disinclined to believe this.The Prime Minister suggested that the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff should see Mr. Solomon on the matter.Palestine.Mesopotamia.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported thatAmman, which is to be General Allenby&apos;s objective, had been strengthened by 3,000 rifles.   It was probable, therefore, that they enemy intended to fight there.y4. Attention was drawn to a telegram from the commander in-Chief, India, to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, which indicated, the possibility of the British forces in Mesopotamiabeing attacked after they had been reduced by the movement oftroops from that area.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff pointed out that-General Marshall still had more troops than he could handle, andGeneral Wilson considered that it was quite safe to continue withthe proposed movement of troops.Inter-AlliedCommittees onAviation and&apos;   Tanks.y 61Hospital Ships:Reprisals.5. With reference to War Cabinet 360, Minute 15, theSecretary of State for War laid before the War Cabinet theReports of the Committees on Tanks and Aviation (Papers G.T.-3918 and G.T.-3919), which the War Cabinet approved, subject to agreement by the other nations represented on the Supreme WarCouncil.reference to War Cabinet 150, Minute 7, thethe Exchequer reported that a question was being6. WithChancellor ofasked in the House of Commons that day, by Major Hunt, M.Pas to whether German prisoners were to be put on board hospital ships for the purpose of safeguarding our wounded officers andmen.The War Cabinet were reminded of their previous decisionon this subject, and it was stated that definite information hadbeen obtained that no German officers were placed on board Trenchhospital ships in the Mediterranean. It was pointed out that, ifthis practice were adopted, German submarines might causeBritish hospital ships to be boarded, take off the German prisoners,and then sink the ships. It was also pointed out by the First sea lord that if we placed German prisoners on board our hospital ships it would, prejudice their status.The War Cabinet decided that The Chancellor of the Exchequer should reply that thismatter had been carefully considered, in conjunction withthe naval and military authorities, but that it was not afit subject for Parliamentary discussion.
The Cattegat.y7. The First Sea Lord reported that a large raid had that daybeen carried out in the Cattegat, with a view to the seizure of any german craft in those waters, but that no reports had yet beenreceived. He also reported considerable activity off Zeebrugge,causing commotion among torpedo-boats and destroyers. Theactual damage bad not been ascertained.Formation of eastern Committee.8. &quot;With reference to War Cabinet 363, Minute 20, enquiry was made as to what progress had been made with the constitutionof the new Eastern Committee.Lord Curzon explained that, acting on instructions from theWar Cabinet, he bad drawn up the proposed Terms of Reference,which he had sent to the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the Minister of Blockade for their comments.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he had prepared a memorandum on the subject. He laid stress on theimportance of not weakening the responsibility of the Depart -rnents concerned, and of centralising all work with the Committee.As the Committee would confine itself primarily to questions ofpolicy and the co-ordination of Departmental action in relief ofthe work of the War Cabinet, he supported the view that amember of the War Cabinet without Portfolio should be chairman.The War Cabinet postponed further discussion until lord curzon&apos;s memorandum and the memorandum of theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs were available.Persia.Proposed british mission to Japan.ry9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed outthat there was every indication of a considerable change in our policy in Persia, which change was being forced on us by thecourse of events.The War Cabinet decided that The question should be brought up for discussion atdate.vlv10. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bysubject  of the Proposed MissiontoLord Beaverbrook, on theJapan (Paper G.T.-3916).The Secretary of State for War stated that the Mission had nothing to do with propaganda, and was entirely a military mission for the purpose of the presentation of a baton to theMikado, and he urged that the military mission should be keptentirely distinct from any political mission.Lord Robert Cecil stated that, in his opinion, the Missionwould have little value from the point of view of removing an impression in the minds of the Japanese that we were doing badlyin the war. There were, however, advantages in sending a mission to raise our prestige in Japan.He considered that there were great advantages in sending,as head of the Mission, some person of dignity and importance touphold British prestige and strengthen the Alliance.It was generally agreed that H.R.H. The Duke of Connaught,if in sufficiently good health and if prepared to undertake it,would be eminently suitable to head the Mission.Mr. Barnes pointed out that, from messages he had seen from japan, it was evident that serious misapprehensions existed inthat country with regard to the attitude of British labour towardsthe war.The War Cabinet decided that it was desirable to form theMission on the following principles: (a.) That with.il. The Duke of Connaught, or, failing him,
H..R.H. Prince Arthur of Connaught, should be askedto head the Mission.(&amp;.) That a peer of distinction should also be added.(c.) That the Minister of Information should consider the names of minor officials who might be suitable as mem-bers of the Mission.(d.) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should telegraph to our Ambassador at Tokio, asking him togive confidentially his views as to the best kind of mission it would be desirable to send.(e.) That the final decision, and all other action except thatmentioned in (d), should be postponed until a report had been received from the Secretary of State fory Foreign Affairs.Meeting of supreme War.: z---  3Allied GeneralEeserve.Employment of italian Troops on western Front.Transfer of Britishand French Divi-sions from Italianto French Front.11. With reference to War Cabinet 359, Minute 14, the PrimeMinister informed the War Cabinet that the following resolutionshad been agreed to at the meetings of the Supreme War Councilon the 14th and 15th March, 1918:-(a.) (1.) The creation of a General Reserve for the wholeof the armies on the Western, Italian, and Balkanfronts, as decided at Versailles on the 2ndFebruary, 1918, is maintained (see War Cabinet338, Minute 2).(2.) In view of the great enemy concentration on theWestern front, and the likelihood of an earlyattack on the British section of the line, .he pro-posals of the Executive War Board for the com-position of the General Reserve require modification.(3.) The British and French divisions now on the italian front, together with the British division which ha,sjust left that front, and a quota of Italian divi-sions, to be determined by the Executive war board, shall form the nucleus of the general reserve.(4.) The Executive War Board are at once to decide thefollowing questions: (a.) The number of divisions to be allotted as theItalian quota of the General Reserve.(&amp;.) The desirability of an immediate transfer tothe Western front of some of the British,French, and Italian divisions now on theItalian front.(5.) To assist them in carrying out paragraph 4 above,The Executive War Board, or a Committee ofGeneral Officers nominated by them with theapproval of their Governments, are at once to con-fer with the Commander-in-Chief of the italian army.At  a later  meeting the following GeneralOfficers were nominated: General Maistre to represent France,General   Rawlinson    to   represent    GreatBritain,General Bliss to represent the United Statesof America,General Giardino to represent Italy.(6.) The decision of the Executive War Board on theabove points will immediately be notified to the
The Functions ofthe Executive war board, and theCreation of an allied general reserve.Aerial &quot;Reprisals.Requisitioning of dutch Shipping.(b.)(c.)Employment of dutch Shipping.(cl.)Creation of Inter-Allied Transporta-tion Council, v[1365-366]4four Governments, so that if political considera-tions are involved the Governments may intervene.(7.) In the event of the Executive War Board being un-able to reach a unanimous decision on resolution in paragraph 4, the question will be decided bycommunications between the Governments or at ameeting of the Supreme War Council.(8.) The nucleus of the General Reserve will be formed from such divisions as may be decided as providedabove, and the General Reserve will thereafter be gradually expanded as the arrival of fresh divi-sions from the United States of America, byrelieving the pressure on the other armies,.enablesfurther divisions to be released.(9.) With regard to the functions of the Executive war board and the creation of an Allied general reserve, raised by General Foch. the supreme war Council decided (i.) That the agreement arrived at between the commanders-in-Chief of the Allied armies in France for mutual support shall be com-municated formally to the Permanent Mili-tary Representatives at Versailles,(ii.) That the Permanent Military Representa-tives shall prepare forthwith, in consulta-tion with the Commanders-in-Chief con-cerned, a plan for supporting the italian army in the event of an enemy offensive onthat front, and submit their proposals totheir respective Governments.The Supreme War Council agree that the British andFrench Governments should announce that the opera-tions of British and French aircraft, even when carriedout as measures of reprisals for the bombardment of open towns by the enemy, are always, as a matter of fact, directed against objectives of military importance.The Supreme War Council have carefully considered theMemorandum of the Allied Naval Council, setting forth the disadvantages of drawing Holland into thewar, whether as an ally or as an enemy., They havealso considered Joint Note No. 17 of the permanent military Representatives, on the possible militaryconsequences of such an eventuality. The supreme war Council are of opinion that the risk of Hollandbeing drawn into the war in consequence of the requi-sition of Dutch shipping is a remote one, and that,in view of the urgent and immediate need of shipping,as set forth in the Note of the Allied Maritime Trans-port Council, the risk is one that should be accepted.They therefore recommend that the policy of requi-sitioning Dutch shipping should be adhered to.As the French Government have agreed not to discon-tinue the transport of 350,000 tons of French coal into italy by the 15th April, 1918, the Supreme WarCouncil are of opinion that the Dutch shipping in american ports should be used, in the first place, forthe indispensable requirements of the American Mili-tary Programme.The Supreme War Council approve the recommendationof Major-General Sir P. A. M. Nash for the creationof an Inter-Allied Transportation Council at Paris,under the Supreme War Council, consisting of a repre-sentative of each of the four Allied Governments, andC
charged with the functions set forth in section 3, par.11, of General Nash&apos;s Report: &quot; I recommend that an Inter-Allied TransportationCouncil should be created at Paris under theSupreme War Council, consisting of a represen-tative of each of the four Allied Governments.This Council should be charged with fulfillingthe following main functions: (i.) (a.) To advise the Supreme War Council at versailles of the transportation aspect ofall plans of campaign on the western front.(b.) To negotiate with the Allied Govern-ments concerned as to the provision ofsuch additional railway facilities as arenecessary to give effect to any acceptedplan of campaign, or to relieve thegeneral position, and to arrange for anyextraneous assistance required in men ormaterial.(ii.) (a.) To prepare, when called upon to do so,schemes for the consideration of theSupreme War Council for all large move-ments of troops between one section of thefront and another.(b.) To make, when instructed to do so,necessary preparation with the Inter-Allied Governments concerned for the carrying out of such movements, includingwhen necessary a redistribution of mobileresources of railway- material and personnel.(iii.) To study the enemy position regardingtransportation facilities of every kind, and advise the Supreme War Council as to theenemy&apos;s capabilities of concentrating and maintaining their forces on any particularsector of their front, and as to the points at which, and methods by which, theenemy&apos;s&quot; railway communications can be attacked from the air with greatesteffect.(iv.) To prepare schemes to develop continental,railwajr lines of communication so as to relieve sea, lines of communication, and tonegotiate with the Governments concernedregarding the best utilisation of the Alliedrailway resources to economise sea trans-port.(v.) To watch the performance of the differentagencies operating the lines of communica-tion on the Western front, bringing to thenotice of the Governments or armies con-cerned cases in which the fullest use doesnot appear to be made of available resources, and suggesting remedies.&quot;The War Cabinet approved the foregoing resolutions, andconnection with resolution (&amp;) decided that--Although the British Government was to make an announce-in en t as to the nature of our aerial reprisals, suchannouncement should not be made until a question was raised in Parliament as to the reprisals referred to.
WC 366As regards resolution (d). Lord Robert Cecil pointed outthat, since the Supreme War Council had met, he had received a communication from Mr. Stevens to the effect that the latter was afraid the resolution, as it stood, would be interpreted by theauthorities of the United States of America as meaning that theDutch shipping in question was to be used exclusively for military transport, and that he (Lord Robert Cecil) had replied that theAllied Maritime Transport Council had been of opinion that,although the Dutch shipping had been primarily earmarked forthat purpose, the latter Council thought that a portion, say70,000 tons, could be spared in connection with the conveyance ofcoal to Italy.The War Cabinet requested Lord Robert Cecil to send a telegram to Lord Reading,pointing out the views of the Allied Maritime Trans-port Council in this matter, for communication to theGovernment of the United States of America-Political Confer-ence :Great Britain,France, and Italy.Japan and Siberia.,3. fThe Publication ofMercantileShipping Losses.12. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that aPolitical Conference bad been held en the 15th instant, attended by the Prime Ministers of France, Italy, and himself, and thefollowing conclusions had been reached: (a.) Note had been taken of the views of the permanent military Representatives, as set forth in Joint note no. 16, and the Conference had agreed that a jointDeclarations withregard to theGerman-russian and German-Ukraine Peace,Poland, andArmenia.&apos; Next Meeting ofthe Supreme WarCouncil.telegraphic dispatch should be sent to PresidentWilson advocating Japanese intervention in Siberia.(b.) The Conference having heard an explanation by Sir ErieGeddes, agreed that particulars of the losses fromsubmarine attack and of the shipbuilding output,should be published. At the request of Sir Eric Geddesthey agreed that no announcement should be made before the 21st March. Sir Eric Geddes undertook,in drafting the announcement, to take special carethat stress was laid on the exaggerated figures of sub-do omarine losses published in Germany.(c.) The Conference agreed on the issue of a joint declara-tion condemning, in the most effective manner possible.Germany&quot;s treatment of Russia after the surrender ofthe Bolshevists, which merely afforded a stimulus tothe Allies not to make the same mistake of treating-with a treacherous enemy.(d.) On the proposal of Mr. Lloyd George it was decidedthat, if agreeable to the Italian Government, the next meeting of the Supreme War Council should be heldin Italy, at some place to be selected by the ItalianGovernment.The War Cabinet approved the conclusions reached at thePolitical Conference, as set out above.3*Maisons tolcrerx. &apos;   13. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thein France. Secretary of State for War in regard to the maisons tolerees inFrance (Paper G.T.-3982).Lord Derby said that agitation on this subject was growingnot only in the House of Commons but all over the country. Thequestion to be decided was not whether the houses were to be closed, for they were established by the French Government andwere in no way under our control, but whether they should beput out of bounds for our troops.The Adjutant-General said that he had communicated withthe Adjutant-General in France, and he must warn the Govern-[1365-366] D
*/ disease..meat that if the houses were placed out of bounds it was expectedthat there would be a considerable increase in venereal disease.The streets would have to be picketed, involving an increase inthe military police, and men who entered the nouses- would be punished by court-martial. At present the amount of disease was serious enough, the number of cases averaging about 8,000, or, inother words, little short of one division permanently out of action.Mr. Macpherson said the question appeared to him to be anational rather than a military one. He received daily an enormous number of letters indignantly protesting against whatwas regarded as our approval of, or connivance at, these institu-tions. He felt that, unless these houses were placed out of bounds,the action of the Government could not be defended in the Houseof Commons or the country, and that the goodwill of a mostrespectable part of the community towards the national causewould be alienated.It was further pointed out that, while it was hitherto thoughtthat if we placed the houses out of bounds, our action mightoffend the susceptibilities of our Allies, it has now been stated by M. Clemenceau and M. Pichon that they were quite willing to consent to our exercising our judgment in an)&apos; way we pleased.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The maisons tolerees in France should be placed out ofbounds for His Majesty&apos;s Naval, Military, and AirForces of the Crown.(b.) The Army Council should investigate what steps werebeing taken by the French Government and theCanadian Military  Authorities to prevent venerealInter-Ally Council 14. The War Cabinet had before them  a.  letter from Mr.on Purchases: Crosby to the Prime Minister in regard to the co-ordination, byCo-ordination of t]ie Supreme War Council, of requests for credits for the pur-request for Credit.   chase of material of war (Paper G.T.-3886)Mr. Chamberlain said that there were various AlliedExecutives dealing with such commodities as wheat, meats, and fats, &amp;e, but there was no similar machinery for dealingwith materials of war, ext., lorries. He suggested that thereshould be some body co-ordinating requests and in control of the pool of such supplies. He supported Mr. Crosby&apos;s letter pro-posing that the stocks in hand * and new requirements of theseveral armies should, be examined by the Military Repreentativeson the Supreme War Council.,The War Cabinet concurred with Mr. Chamberlain, subjectto the other Governments approving similar action, and decidedthat (a.) The Secretary should communicate their approval ofMr. Crosby&apos;s proposal to the British military representatives at Versailles.(b.) Mr. Crosby should be notified by the Secretary of thisdecision, and should be informed that the War Cabinetassume that he will ascertain the decision of the other- Allied Governments concerned, with a. view to similar action, and will notify Versailles of their decisions.s/ _Meat liations in 15. With reference to War Cabinet 347,  Minute  9, Mr.the Army. Chamberlain called attention to the fact that, whereas the Britishsoldier was receiving a. meat ration greatly in excess of the civilianration, he was also able, not only in France, but also in England,to purchase at the canteens additional meatstuffs. The wholequestion of dollars, supplies, and tonnage was involved. Hesuggested that the time had come for consideration whether either
the ration should be reduced or the sale of rationed productsat the canteens stopped at home.The men who enjoyed this privilege included &quot;soldiers&quot;engaged on purely office work, men of low categories who would never be sent abroad.The Prime Minister observed that this raised a very important question. He thought that the whole position, not onlyin Great Britain, but in France also, should be reconsidered.Lord Derby said that an experiment had already been madein the direction of differentiating between soldiers doing hardmanual work, on the one hand, and sedentary work on the other,but that it had led to great difficulty.Mr. Chamberlain undertook to send the Secretary a Memo-randum on the question for circulation to the WarCabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March IS, 1918.
