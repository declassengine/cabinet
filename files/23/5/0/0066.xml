The First Sea Lord stated that he had received a report that&quot;Watt.&quot; the French submarine &quot; Watt &quot; had been attacked by one of ourconvoys by mistake.   He regretted to state that the captain and one/man had been killed, and three others wounded.Enemy Submarinesat Santorin.3.

Four of these were destroyed, one falling in our lines.He also stated that 17 25-lb. and 27 16-lb. bombs had been dropped on Ghistelles aerodrome. Four bombs had also been dropped onZeebrugge mole, and four near the coastal motor-boat base atBlankenberghe.   All our machines had returned safely.ImmediateReinforcementsand their transport.5. With reference to War Cabinet 373, Minute S,- the secretary reported that he had received the following letter from the FirstLord of the Admiralty, with regard to the proposed increase of themovement of troops to France : &quot; Admiralty, Whitehall,&quot; Dear Hankey, March 26, 1918.&quot; At a meeting in the Prime MinisteFs room with theDirector of Movements and Railways and the Director ofTransport and Shipping, the Prime Minister, Mr. Bonar Law,and myself being present, and also at a later stage the Adjutant-General, it was decided to increase the movement of troops toFrance to 30,000 a day.&quot;I. was asked whether the Admiralty could provide additional escorts for this number. I said that, while if mightbe possible to reduce escorts in other directions and devotethem to this cross-Channel work, I did not feel that my NavalAdvisers would recommend that any of our consolidated forces should be reduced at the present time, and that it was infinitelypreferable to take the necessary risk and send troop transportseither unescorted or with a lighter escort, whether that be attained by increasing the size of the convoys or reducing thestrength of the escort.-&apos;-I was to let the Director of Transport and Shipping andthe Director of Movements and Railways know if, upon con-suiting my Naval Advisers, any modification of this view was tobe made. 1 find that no modification is desired by them, andthey concur in the views I. expressed, and orders have alreadybeen given to effect what is desired; but, of course, it will be understood by the Cabinet that the thinning of the escorts andthe possibility of troopships going unescorted, or with reducedescort, involves a risk which must be faced, but which, in thecircumstances, the Admiralty consider preferable to reducing our consolidated forces elsewhere......&quot;As far as possible, it will be arranged to send these troop-ships with an escort, even although it is an inadequate one, so
3WC 374      ISOthat, should one he torpedoed, the escort will he available for life-saving.&quot;You will, perhaps, place this upon the minutes of thenext Cabinet Meeting, so that it shall be on record.&quot; A copy has been sent to the Adjutant-General, to theDirector of Movements and Railways, and to the ShippingController.&quot; Yours sincerely,&quot;(Signed)      E. Geddes.&quot;It was stated that 30,000 men could be got across to-morrow,but the Secretary of State for War said that he could not work upto this number at present, for two reasons:  (c.) That he could not move the men at present in sufficient numbers to the ports.(b.) That France would not be able to absorb as many men atthe present moment into the army.The western front:German Attack.The PresentPosition.6. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff explained thepresent situation on a map. He stated that the enemy had made asmall pocket between the Ancre and the Somme, just east ofCorbie, at the junction of the two rivers. Later in the meeting,however, information was received that the Australians had counter-attacked and captured Morlancourt. The enemy forces were now about 25 kilom. from Amiens. Reports had been received that itwas&apos;now raining, and the change in the weather should be in our favour. &apos; He reported that south of the Somme our troops were veryweak, and that the resistance in this particular area was not veryrstrong. Questioned as to any signs of the attack dying away,General Wilson stated that there were such signs north of the somme. He further said that a message had been interceptedwhich gave information that a strong attack was likely to be madeat Bucquoy, and that a fresh division of three German Guardsregiments had been brought up with this object. We had in this area a New Zealand division and a number of tired divisions in reserve, but the 2nd Canadian Division was arriving shortly. Withregard to our reserves still unengaged, General Wilson stated thatthere were five divisions available, two of which should arriveto-day. He further reported that the French were taking over theline up to the Somme, and that General Gough, commanding the5th Army, was now under the or-ders of General Fayolle.Attention was drawn to the menace to Amiens, and the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff considered the next few days critical.Field-Marshal Lord French considered that the ground east ofAmiens was very suitable for defensive purposes.General Wilson reported that nine French divisions had been moved up as reinforcements, and that more divisions (the numberof which he mentioned! were on their way.At a later stage in the meeting the Director of MilitaryOperations reported that a telegram had just been received statingthat during the night the British troops were pressed back a short distance on both banks of the Somme, and that early this morningthey were holding a position Rosieres-Harbonnieres-Sailley-le-Sec-Merieourt-LAbbee, and that the enemy had now reachedAlbert. General Maurice also stated that at one time the enemy had crossed the Ancre north of Albert, but had been driven out by a counter-attack, and that north of this point there was no change inthe situation. Information had been received that south of theriver the 16th Irish Division, although it had suffered very heavy losses, was holding the ground well, but that a further attack was anticipated in this area.   South of Rosieres the Vth Army, under
the command of the French, was holding its positions well. Therewas no change at Roye and Noyon. Our aeroplanes had dropped224/ tons of bombs on Bapaume and Peronne, and the low-flyingmachines were inflicting heavy losses on the enemy&apos;s reserves.Condition of theVth Army.7*iyy7. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that theVth Army could no longer be regarded as a fighting unit. It was even doubtful whether any of the corps in this army could beconsidered as lighting units. There were, perhaps, some divisions,but there was very little information available, and he had at thepresent no idea of the number of casualties. He stated that thisarmy had passed to the command of the French, who were nowrelieving it, and who were gradually extending towards the Soinme.It was hoped that by degrees the divisions would be taken out ofthe line and re-organised. General Wilson stated that the french were detraining at Montdidier, and in this area it was really a raceas to whether the French could collect enough men to prevent the capture of Amiens. It had been agreed that the British and french forces should do their utmost to avoid being separated.Assistance by united states forces in France.&apos; ^.&quot; /%-S. With reference to War Cabinet 373, Minute 6, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff reported that General Rawlinson had seen General Pershing at Versailles yesterday, and that general pershing would uot agree to put the American battalions in theBritish divisions, as he was very anxious to keep his organisationof divisions intact. He had, however, agreed to send Americanengineers to the front, and to put American divisions into the line to relieve French divisions. General Wilson said that there wrasto be another meeting at Versailles to-day.  -The War Council decided that A strongly-worded telegram, drafted by the Prime Minister,with a view to ultimate publication, shordd be sent direct to President Wilson from the War Cabinet, explaining thewhole situation.Conference atDoullens.3&quot;.9. With reference to War Cabinet 373, Minute 1, Lord Milnergave a full&apos;account of his recent visit to France, particulars ofwhich he undertook to circulate. At an important Conference atDoullens yesterday, which was attended by the President of theFrench Republic, M. Clemenceau, M. Loucheur, Lord Milner himself,Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff, General Petain, and General Foch, the following decision hadbeen&apos; taken :  &quot;Le General Foch est charge parles gouvernements britanniqueet francais de coordonner Factiondes armees ailiees sur le frontouest. II s&apos;entendra a cet effetavec les generaux en chef, quisont invites a lui fournir tous lesrenseignernents necessaires.clemenceau.Milner.&quot; (Signe)&quot; Doullens, le 26 mars, 1918.&quot; General Foch is charged bythe British and French Govern-ments to co-ordinate the actionof the Allied armies on theWestern front. He will work tothis end with the Commanders-in-Chief, who are asked to furnish him with all necessary information.&quot; (Signed)   Clemenceau.Milner.&quot; Doullens, March 26, 1918.&quot;Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haigha aapproved and welcomedthis arrangement. Lord Milner explained that the practical effectof this arrangement was to put the supreme control under General
Foch, who would thus supersede the Executive War Board at versailles.The War Cabinet approved this arrangement, and placed onon record their thanks to Lord Milner for the action hehad taken.The War Cabinet decided that the following action should betaken : (a.) That the Chief of the Imperial General Staff should informField-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig of the approval of theWar Cabinet to the above agreement.(b.) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should inform the French Government by telegram of the WarCabinePs approval.(c.) That the Pi ime Minister should incorporate this informa-tion in his telegram to President Wilson, alluded to in minute 8.German Reserves. 10. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theGermans still had 31 divisions in reserve and not yet employed.Their total strength was 193 divisions on the Western front, ofwhich 70 had been identified by the British forces during the recenty fighting.11. With reference to War Cabinet 373, Minute 7, the WarCabinet took note of the following telegram which had been sent by the Prime Minister to Lord Reading to be read at a banquetin New York : &quot; Your personal telegram of 25th March.&quot; We are at the crisis of the war. Attacked by an immense superiority of German troops our army has been forced to retire. The retirement has been carried outmethodically before the pressure of a steady succession of freshGerman reserves, which are suffering enormous losses. Thesituation is being faced with splendid courage and resolution.The dogged pluck of our troops has for the moment checkedthe ceaseless onrush of the enemy, and the French have nowjoined in the struggle. But this battle, the greatest and mostmomentous in the history of the world, is only just beginning.Throughout it French and British are buoyed up with theknowledge that the great republic of the West will neglect no effort which can hasten its troops and its ships to Europe. Inwar, time is vital. It is impossible to exaggerate the importanceof getting American reinforcements across the Atlantic in the shortest&apos;possible space of time.(Signed) &quot; Lloyd George.&quot;Telegram toLord Reading.[1365-374]C
2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.,March 27, 1918.12. With reference to War Cabinet 37ft, Minute 11, a preliminary discussion took place on the subject of compulsory military service in Ireland.The Prime Minister said that he had yesterday seen the chief secretary for Ireland, General Sir Bryan Mahon, and General Bryne,the head of the Royal Irish Constabulary, whom he had asked tocome over to consider the question of man-power. .- He had firstinterviewed Mr. Duke, who had expressed grave doubts on theproposal. He then saw General Bryne; who expressed the opinionthat he had no doubt that compulsory military service in ireland would be a mistake; that, by passing and enforcing such ameasure, both the whole of the Catholics and the Nationalists haIreland would be united against the British Empire ; that therewould be the greatest difficulty in enlisting men ; that in townsthere would be actual riots; and that, when the men were obtained, he was very doubtfal as to what their actual worth wouldbe. The Prime Minister had then interviewed Sir Bryan Mahon,who, on the whole, was in favour of the proposal. General Mahon,however, was of opinion that considerable trouble would ensue inIreland. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that he had left General Mahon and General Byrne together, in order to discussthe proposal, and to make a report for his information. The chief secretary had forwarded the report to the Prime Minister (Appendix).On the other hand, the War Cabinet were reminded that the enforcement of a drastic application of compulsory military service in Great Britain, as contemplated in the draft Bill circulated by theMinister of National Service (Paper G.T.-4036), would be verydifficult if Ireland were exempted.The War Cabinet decided that This question should be discussed at a War Cabinet meeting tobe summoned for 5*30 that evening, and that the chief secretary for Ireland, General Sir Bryan Mahon, andGeneral Byrne, the head of the Royal Irish Constabidary,should be invited to attend.With a view to throwing some light on the probable lightingvalue of conscripted Irishmen, on which expert opinion is divided The Chief of the Imperial General Staff was asked to obtain thefacts as to the fighting qualities displayed by the 16thIrish Division during the recent fighting.In the most recent phase of the battle this division had beenreported to be fighting well (see Minute 6).
G.T.-4049.Application op Military Service Act to Ireland.Memorandum, by General Officer Commanding-in-Ghief, Irish Command.THE following was written by General Mahon, and tbe parts underlmed* are the comments on the memorandum made by General Byrne, who otherwise approves of it.(Signed) H. E. DUKE.March 26, 1918.Conscription can be enforced, but with the greatest difficulty. It will be bitterlyopposed by the united Nationalists and the clergy. The present time is the worst for it since I have been in Ireland, because the cry will be : England down, &quot;Ireland&apos;sopportunity.&quot; Some of the difficulties would be organised strikes dislocating the life ofthe country, railway, post office and telegraph communications cut. There are fewertroops in Ireland than there have been for some time. More have to be taken. Wewould have to have additional troops for the time, at least two brigades (? I thinkconsiderably more). These, I do not anticipate, would be required for more than threemonths.Ireland would have to be divided into several districts. It would be a question that will have to be considered if compulsion is put in force in the whole simul-taneously, or district by district. But to render it feasible either way, the country must be put under some kind of military control. Law would have to be dropped,because ordinarily, for the first fortnight at least, there Would be bloodshed and agreat deal of suffering to the civil population in every way, and hardships.The number of men we would get I cannot estimate. Ten months ago I estimated160,000, with very liberal exemptions. It ought to be more now with increased age.I am of opinion that some of the men when got would make good and reliable soldiers(a considerable number might be likely to give trouble). The police would have to be concentrated into larger parties, thus curtailing their usefulness. Coast watching wouldbe interfered with, also tillage.I would suggest that the first thing is to get all known leaders out of the way atonce ; extra troops should be on the spot simultaneously, and everyone, irrespective ofwho he is, arrested on first sign of giving trouble.These measures would be drastic, but the situation is serious, or it would not beconsidered necessary to have conscription at this inopportune time.* Printed in italics.APPENDIX.
