The Italian Front. 1. The Director of Military Intelligence informed the WarCabinet that on the 28th instant the Italians carried out an offensive on the Asia-go Plateau, to the west of the Brenta, and that information had been received from General Plumer that it wasvery successful and a great improvement on previous efforts, th-&quot;nrinfantry attacking really well. It appeared that the Italiansgained most of their objectives, and captured from 1,500 to 2,000prisoners. Some of our batteries and aeroplanes assisted in the attack. General Macdonogh added that, although they had to give up some ground owing to counter-attacks, the Italians still, retained a certain amount of new ground on the 8-kilometrey front in question.Palestine. 2. The Director of Military Intelligence stated that the rail-, way in Palestine had been advanced sufficiently to enable a .ou-^   struction train to get through, on the 27th instant, to Jerusalem.Bombing Raid. 3. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that a bombing raid was carried out on Coolkerke Aerodrome on the 29th instant, andthat a fire was observed to break out amongst the buildings at the^ &apos; north-west corner of the aerodrome.4. With reference to War Cabinet 333, Minute 8, the DeputvFirst  Sea Lord stated that an air  reconnaissance over Con-stantinople indicated that the &quot; Goeben &quot; was secured at her oldbillet alongside the S.S. &quot; General,&quot; inside the inner bridge of thev&apos; Golden Horn.Submarine &quot;E 14;&quot; 5. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that there was no news-3^ r&apos;f submarine &quot; E. 14,&quot; which entered the Dardanelles with a viewifi -y.        to attacking the &quot; Goeben,&quot; and that, as she had failed to carry outher instructions as to keeping up communications, it was fearedy that the submarine was lost.H.M.S. &quot; Raglan&quot; 6. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that a court-martialand &quot; M 28.&quot; had been ordered to enquire into the loss of H.M.S. &apos;; Raglan &apos;&apos; andy/&quot;the monitor &quot; M. 28.&quot;The &quot; Goeben.&quot;Naval Loss. 7. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that an armed boardingsteamer, whilst employed on convoy duties, had gone ashore on xhecoast of Norway, and it was under consideration, in view o!the reasonable time allowed by the Norwegians for the carrying outof repairs under international law, to arrange for the vessel toy&apos; proceed to Stavahger with a view to her-being made seaworthy.Missions to 8. Lord Robert Cecil brought to the notice of the War CabinetAmerica. the question of officials proceeding to America to join up with our^^-J - Missions there without Lord Reading being made aware of the fact3- prior to their sailing.   He pointed out that, by the terms of lord reading&apos;s appointment, he was in supreme charge of the wholeof the Missions, and had power to send, individual members home or to veto the taking up of their appointment. Lord Robert Cecdproposed that, before sending an official to the United States theDepartment concerned should communicate by telegraph with lord reading, and that, when making an application for a passport forthe official in question, a notification should be made on the docu-ment that Lord Reading had been informed.   Lord Robert Cecil
The Food 9. With reference to War Cabinet 296, Minute 15, the war situation: Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Food Controller on compulsory compulsory rationing (Paper G.-192), together with a Report byRationing. a Deparmental Committee of the Ministry of Food on rationing and Distribution.Lord Rhondda  briefly  indicated the  main features of hisrationing policy as set forth in his Memorandum.   Under an Orderof the 22nd December,  1917,  Food  Control  Committees were authorised to introduce local schemes of rationing in respect ofall articles of which there was a shortage, in particular meat and fats.   A uniform scheme to deal with meat and fats was being introduced for London and the Home Counties, which would cover a quarter of the population of Great Britain.   A similar schemewas contemplated  to  cover  practically the   whole of Scotland.Schemes were already in operation in the West Midlands and onthe North-East Coast.   It was hoped that  by the beginning ofMarch  the  whole  country would be covered by local rationingschemes, dealing in all cases with fats, in many with meat, and insome cases with other articles also.   There had been in operationsince the 1st January. 1918. a national and uniform scheme of rationing for sugar, which was working very well and was dealingwith about 40.000 removals per week.   Lord Rhondda expressed his thanks for the able assistance given by the Postmaster-Generaland the Post Office staff which contributed largely to the successof the sugar rationing scheme.   An attempt was being made asregards the local schemes to combine local responsibility withcentral direction and advice, although, while every effort was being-made to secure substantial uniformity in the local schemes, therewas bound to be considerable delay and difficulty in attaining suchuniformity under the national scheme recommended.   One of themost difficult duties of the-local committees would be the grading of Avorkers in various ration classes, and in th is, as in other matters,the Ministry would afford all possible assistance to the localcommittees.    Considerable progress had been made in dealingwith the production and distribution of margarine.   A numberof   factories   had   been   set   up,   installations   Avere   being brought   over   from   Denmark   and   Holland   and   by   next summer the supply Avould be   four   times   Avhat   it   was   in1915.   The meat position would also be easier presently.   Therewas no doubt that last autumn cattle came forward too rapidly,and though the present shortage had been to some extent dis-counted, it had not been anticipated that it would be so serious.At the present moment quotas of meat for the different districtswere being worked out.   Committees of farmers were being estab-: lished, Avhb Avould be responsible for controlling the supply of the cattle and sheep for the market. These farmers kneAV that unlesssupplies were forthcoming the cattle would be commandeered, bythe&apos;Department. He did not wish to conceal from the War Cabinetthat the question of securing to each locality its proper quota of! 1365 --334] &apos; &apos; &apos; - B 2proposed that a circular should be addressed to all Departmentsconcerned, with a view to their taking such action as he had in-dicated, and he would issue the necessary instructions to the Pass-port Office.The War Cabinet decided that All Departments should, in the first instance, communicate toLord Reading by telegraph the name of the official they proposed to send, and that in due course, if no reply was &apos;received from Lord Reading, application should be madefor the necessary passport, it being stated on the applica-tion that Lord Reading had been communicated with.
food supplies was one of very great difficulty, owing to the number and variety of existing trade channels, but he thought that the meat situation just now was at its worst and would steadily im-prove. With regard to cereals, and to bread in particular, he was anxious to postpone rationing to the last possible moment,Mr. G. 11. Roberta said that it was most important that labour should be fully represented on the Local Rood Committees,and that Labour should, in that way, be made to feel very definiteresponsibility for the machinery of food distribution. It was not enough to make Labour representation optional; he would prefer to see it mandatory, at least in all the great industrial centres. he asked if it would not be possible for the Ministry of Food to con-suit the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress,and the Executive of the Labour Party on the matter.Lord Rhondda explained that the Food Control Committeeshad, in the first instance, been set up by the local authorities,and he had taken steps to reduce the number of traders wherethey were over-represented on the Committees, and had instructed the Committees to take on additional representatives of labour in cases of under-representation. He did not think it was desirable to compel the Local Committees to add Labour repre-sentatives; it was important to carry the good-will of the localauthorities. In reply to a question whether the Ministry couldnot take exceptional measures to meet the acute situation nowprevailing, Lord Rhondda replied that he thought it would be dangerous to give higher temporary prices as a bonus. special allowances were at present being despatched to particular districts where the shortage was serious. He thought perhaps the ArmyCouncil might do more in the way of releasing some of their storestemporarily; but, of course, the Army was bound to have firstcall on the supplies.Major Waldorf Astor said that some steps were necessaryto ensure that the Local Committees used the powers more rapidly and effectively which had been delegated to them. The situationin Plymouth, for example, was most unsatisfactory, as the LocalCommittee could not get out of the habit of condemning theGovernment instead of realising that the duty of rationingsupplies properly had been laid on them. He found that soldierswere obtaining plent3r of milk while children were going shortthrough bad distribution. Lord Rhondda replied that Plymouthwas an exceptional case, where for a long time there had been an acute controversy between the local authorities and the represent;!-tives of Labour. That was no doubt a case where mandatorypowers would have to be exercised.Lord Rhondda stated that under the national scheme local officers would be needed all over the country which wouldpractically have to be under central control. They would have tobe constantly visited by a trained inspectorate, and a large numberof officers would have to be set up outside those of the localauthorities. The cost of installing the scheme had been estimatedat about 3,000,000Z., to come from Imperial Funds.Mr. Vivian (Ministry of Food) stated that in obtainingsuitable premises the help of the Land Valuation department would be sought, and the use of municipal offices, schools, andso forth would be carefully considered before any new expendi-ture was incurred. If as many as 6,000 offices were required, theannual cost on a. conservative estimate would be about 1,500,000Z.for premises and staff.&quot;Lord Rhondda stated that, in spite of the general instructions issued by the War Cabinet that Departments should considerfavourably any applications for staff from the Ministry of Food(War Cabinet 297, Minute 5), the Ministry had found it tmpos-sible to secure the necessary number of trained civil servants.Mr. G. H. RoLerts urged that, in view of the grave industrial,unrest now prevailing and of the way in which the food shortage
was being exploited by extremists, it was very desirable to explain the situation to the public. A comprehensive and authoritativestatement, in the most precise language possible, should appearsimultaneously in as many newspapers as practicable, especially the sunday and provincial newspapers. It should deal clearly withthe fact of the world-shortage, and with our obligations to our allies, and should set forth the policy and activities of theMinistry of Food. Such a statement could be widely used by theWar Aims Committee.It vfiis suggested in this connection that the Prime minister or the Chancellor of the Exchequer might invite a number ofeditors to Downing Street, in order to explain the situation fully to them.Mr. Wintour, who had just returned from a visit to France,said that he was convinced that, compared with this country, therewas an abundance of food in France.Sir David Shackleton wished to warn the War Cabinetagainst the policy of sending extra supplies of food into industrial centres where there wore stoppages, on the ground of suchstoppages. Once the shop stewards realised that such was thepolicy of the Government there would be repeated stoppages overthe country. It was important to remove the impression which now existed that centres like the Clyde. Coventry, and Barrowwere being rationed on the basis of their pre-war population.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that tonnage was a vital factor in the situation, and that so far as finance was con-cerned he was prepared to say, on behalf of the Treasury, thatthe. Ministry of Food should not run short of supplies for lack ofmoney.The War Cabinet decided- To authorise the Food Controller: (a.) To introduce, as from the most convenient date, anational system of compulsory rationing, coveringmeat and fats, in addition to sugar.(b.) To set up the machinery for this and to make all neces-sary preparations for including also cereals, on theunderstanding that before actually rationing cerealshe should report again to the War Cabinet for theirassent.(c.) To incur the expenditure necessary for these objects,including the setting up and staffing of any necessaryoffices and inspectorate.The War Cabinet further instructed the Food Controller (i.) To consider, in consultation with the Minister of Labour,the measures to be taken to strengthen Labour repre-sentation on Local- Food Committees.(ii.) To draft, in consultation with the Minister of Labourand representatives of Newspaper Associations, a comprehensive statement on the food situation, for sub-mission to the Cabinet with a view to publication.(iii.) To prepare a Memorandum on the food situation inFrance.(iv.) To submit a list of officials at present employed in deparments, whose services he wished to obtaintemporarily for the Ministry of Food.3?hc Oha.noeli.oi? of the Exchequer was 3&apos;o&apos;pulSoon- behalf of tho Cabinoto approach the T)apa::tmenby Inorder that thoy might spare iroa their Staffs scrao oftho assistants ^hose help was especially noeded by thePood Ministry in this emergency,(Initialled)     A.B,Lo2. ^itohall Gardens, SAT.30th.
