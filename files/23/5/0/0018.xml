With reference to War Cabinet 323, Minute 7, the first sea Lord stated that, according to a cable received from H.M.S.0. &quot; Suffolk,&quot; at Vladivostock, the partial demobilisation of thegarrison is being taken in hand by the Officer Commanding,Military District, who is loyal to the Allies; the militia regimentsare also being disbanded, and the movement up to the present hasy received the support of the Soviet.Transfer of german divisions to theWestern Front.2. With reference to War Cabinet 324, Minute 5, the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff informed the War Cabinet that two more divisions had been transferred from Russia to the western front, making in all a total of 167 enemy divisions on theWestern front. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff added,that not more than five German divisions were now on the italian front, and that there were, perhaps, fewer than this number.
The Labour 3. &quot;With reference to War Cabinet 317, Mr. Barnes informedSituation: th.8 &quot;War Cabinet that the question of revising the lower-priced7i per cent. Bonus   piece rates had been carefully considered, but that it had not been to Piece-workers.     found practicable to carry it out within a reasonable time.   he stated that a proposal had been laid before him by the Committeeon Production that an increase of 7\ per cent, should be given to,-.        the piece-workers as an equivalent to the 12J per cent, given to,  -*p^        time-workers in certain munition industries.   In the majority ofJLs-&apos; ySi        cases the 7\ per cent, would be equivalent to an increase of rather^&quot; &apos;    &apos; less than 7s. per week, calculated on an average wage.   He pro-posed that the award in the case of Belfast, which was shortly tobe made public, should he issued simultaneously with a statement,made by the Government, which would enable the Ministry ofLabour to deal on similar lines with cases which were parallel tothat of Belfast.It was pointed out that the question of output was so muchinvolved in this matter that, although it would necessitate an in-creased expenditure of some millions of pounds, yet the awardwould mean a far greater saving as regards future output, whichwould fully justify the expenditure of the extra millions.The War  Cabinet approved the action  proposed by Mr.Barnes.Weekly Summaryof Intelligence:Western Front.,7. //S.3.c/ S.4. The Prime Minister brought to the notice of the Secretaryof State for War the Summary of Military Intelligence which was issued by the War Office the previous week, and stated that in itspresent form it was calculated to create panic, as the facts as pre-sentecl did not include certain vital considerations and statistics.It indicated, for instance, that the balance of strength to theenemy had been increased to no less than fifty-one divisions. Fromfigures that he had since obtained from the War Office, it appeared that between January 1917 and the present time our strength had increased, on the whole, comparatively, to the extent of 310,000men, to which must be added the number of troops the UnitedStates had in France. On the other hand, it was admitted thatthe French forces were down 200,000. An instance was given inthe case of the apparent increase of twelve German divisions; thiswas not a correct statement of fact, as these divisions had simplybeen regrouped without any increase in the total rifle strength.It was further mentioned that the battalions in the German army had been reduced from 1,000 to 750.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that the twelve divisions should have been made allowance for in the summary, and that, as regards the reduction of battalions, the real-strength of the German battalion was now 850, 100 of the samebeing in support. The French, however, had also reduced theirbattalions to 750. General Robertson said that he had always felt some doubt as to the strength of the German forces compared withthe Allied strength, and he held the view7 that they were more numerous than we had hitherto laid down. He added that he was now having careful enquiries made on a different basis from thatwhich had hitherto been pursued, and that as soon as possible hewould furnish the War Cabinet with a return showing the revisedfigures.Military service bill.5. With reference to War Cabinet 324, Minute 10, the PrimeMinister read a letter which he had received from Nottingham,from the Labour Party Executive Committee. The letter bore thesignatures of some who were pacifists, and others who were un-doubtedly strong pro-war men. They expressed their seriouswarning&apos; against hastily pressing forward the Man-Power Bill,
3 WG 326having regard to the dangerous state of feeling amongst the work-men; the men coming from all parts of the country to Nottinghamfor the Conference said that the rank and file did not yet under -stand what was proposed, and were very angry. The secretariesand shop stewards were doing all they could to prevent an outburst,&apos;but they all said they were under the utmost apprehension of aspontaneous and tumultuous &quot; down tools.&quot; They feared thattaking the Committee stage this week, in the absence of a numberof Labour members, would lead to an outburst of a regrettablekind in the country, whereas another week&apos;s talking might enablethe men to be got in hand.Sir Auckland Geddes said that he did not believe that any-thing would be gained by delay. Labour was expecting theGovernment to climb down, and his own feeling was that it wouldbe wise for the Govezmment to go straight forward, as had beendecided., and take the Committee stage of the Bill at once. he agreed that it would be desirable, on the Third Reading of theBill, that some of the points made by the Prime Minister duringthe Secret Session should be restated. He suggested that theletter, together with the signatories, should be made known to theHouse of Commons, and that the imperative need of obtainingmen should be given as the reason for pressing forward the Bill.Lord Edmund Talbot and Captain Guest concurred in the view expressed by Sir Auckland Geclcles.On the other hand, it was argued that it would be wise to yield to an appeal of the kind made by the Labour PartyExecutive to the Prime Minister without publication, because sucha course might induce the Labour Party to act graciously. If it-were known that the Labour Party had asked the Government to postpone the matter for a few days, and the Government had refused, there would be strong grounds for resentment. The veryfact of the appeal being made in the way it was, might be taken as an indication that the Labour Party Executive were in a friendly and not a hostile mood.After further discussion it appeared that the balance ofopinion was in favour of proceeding forthwith with the Bill.The War Cabinet decided To adhere to their previous decision that the Bill should be pressed forward.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,January 21, 1918.o
