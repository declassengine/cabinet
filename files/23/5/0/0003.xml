The War Cabinet had before them the Final Report of theCommittee, presided over by Lord Balfour of Burleigh, on commercial and Industrial Policy after the War (Paper G.T.-2891),together with a Memorandum bv the Minister of Reconstruction(Paper G.T.-3087).The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that it was important to consult the Dominion Governments before publishing the Report.Dr. Addison, while anxious for the early publication of theReport, for the reasons given in his Memorandum, agreed that thedelay of two months involved in communicating with the Dominionsand India was not open to objection, and would provide a goodparliamentary answer.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Secretary ofState for India should communicate the Report to the severalDominions and to India, and should urge them to express their views by telegraph. Subject to no serious objectionsbeing made, the War Cabinet decided that the report should then be published.A PsychologicalOffensive:Propaganda.10. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by sir edward Carson (Paper G.T.-2941), and a Memorandum byDr. Addison (Paper G.T.-3031), in regard to a psychologicaloffensive.It was pointed out that, since these Memoranda had originally been circulated, the circumstances had changed by the publication ofthe peace proposals between the Russians and Germans.It was generally agreed that a public statement of our war aimswas becoming increasingly important, which statement should takethe form of a counter-offensive, and it was mentioned that severaldraft statements were in course of preparation.In regard to the German colonies in the Pacific, Mr. Longpointed out that before the war the populations were, for economic reasons, friendly to Germany, and now they were pro-Entente. Withregard to Canada, the anxiety&apos; in that country was in connectionwith the possibility of Germany acquiring wireless stations and submarine bases throughout the world.In regard to Dr. Addisoifs Memorandum dealing with themachinery for the dissemination of propaganda, the Minister of reconstruction was invited to place himself in communication withthe Director of the Department of Information.The general question was adjourned for consideration in con-nection with the deliberations of the War Cabinet on thesubject of peace proposals.Eussia.11. The War Cabinet took note of a despatch published in the&quot; Daily News &quot; on that day from Mr. Arthur Ransome, the &quot; DailyNews&quot; correspondent in Petrograd, who is himself in full sympathy with the Bolshevik movement, announcing the threatened breakdown of the Bolshevik peace negotiations of the Central Powers.Drilling in Ireland. 8. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Chief -Secretary for Ireland (Paper G.T.-2845) as to drillingin Ireland, and the action to be taken with regard to any men thatmight be arrested in consequence of this breach of the Defence ofthe Realm Regulations.The War Cabinet decided To refer the matter for settlement between the War Office, theHome Office, and the Irish Office.
It was suggested that M. Trotzki was, perhaps, finding himselfface to face with an impossible situation involving a general peace atthe expense of Russia, and that possibly Mr. Arthur Ransome&apos;despatch was a signal that M. Trotzki would like to get into touchwith the Allies with a view to extricating himself from his difficulties.Another theory was that M. Trotzki was endeavouring to get theSocialist parties of the different countries into a conference in orderto extend the scope of his fanatical attacks on the existing order ofcivilisation.Considerable difference of opinion was expressed about the motives animating M. Trotzki, but it was generally agreed that itwould be desirable to secure more information.The War Cabinet decided that The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should telegraph to the British Ambassador at Petrograd, advisinghim to get in touch with Mr. Ransome, in order, if possible,to ascertain the precise meaning of his article in the&quot; Daily News,&quot; and what M. Trotzki was aiming at.Palestine: 12. It was suggested to the War Cabinet that scant use hadPropaganda. been made, for propaganda purposes, of the capture of Jerusalem.Sir Edward Carson stated that a vast amount of propagandahad been despatched abroad.On the other hand, it was pointed out that comparatively littleuse had been made of this material by public speakers in thiscountry. It was suggested that material of interest on this subject should be sent to the clergy and ministers of all denominations witha view to its use in the churches.Sir Edward Carson undertook to take the matter in hand.Coal Deposits inIreland. 13. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Reconstruction (Paper G.T.-3036), and a Memorandumby the Chief Secretary for Ireland (Paper G.T.-3095), dealing withthe question of boring for coal in Ireland.The War Cabinet approved the proposals contained in theseMemoranda aud authorised The Minister of Reconstruction to take the necessary action inconsultation with the Chief Secretary for Ireland.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,January 2, 1918.o
