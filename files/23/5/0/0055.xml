THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that onthe 9th instant the Germans had made two attacks, one on theMenin Road and the other at Houthulst Forest. Both these attacks took place on the front of about a battalion, and were pre-ceded by a heavy artillery preparation. The attacks had bothbeen repulsed and our lines regained. The Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff was of opinion that the object of the Germans was toprevent our withdrawing troops from this portion of the line.Transfer of German 2. With reference to War Cabinet 361, Minute 6, the Chief of divisions.      *     the  Imperial General Staff reported  that there were now 186^r^-.-3J/-p    German divisions on the Western front.Possible German 3. With reference to War Cabinet 360, Minute 4., the Chief of attack.      ^/     the Imperial General Staff stated that the situation looked very&quot;5 /j.    much as if the Germans meant to attack the British line, as theywere concentrating on our front and had 92 divisions opposed to[1365-363] B
our 57. Some of these 92 divisions, however, were concentrated asfar back as Namur, and might therefore be moved to the Frenchfront. Included in the above number were four divisions of which one had come from the Argonne, one from. Russia, one from Italy,and one from Alsace.General Wilson also reported that civilian traffic had been entirely suspended in Belgium. On the other hand, from Verdunto the south, that is to say, on the French front, traffic was reported as normal. Civilians were being moved out of all towns betweenLille and La Bassee, but so far Lille itself had not been evacuated.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff added that there wereheavy-artillery movements through Belgium towards our front.Strength of German 4. In answer to a question, the Chief of the Imperial GeneralDivisions. Staff stated, that a German division consisted of nine battalions,each battalion being about 850 strong. The German divisions were, roughly, of the same strength as ours, although, perhaps, oursmight be a little stronger.Armistice atEaster :Proposal by the vatican.2/o.5. The War Cabinet had under consideration telegram No. 15from the Vatican, which proposed that there should be an armisticeof one or two weeks for all belligerents in the Western and Italianfronts at Easter.It was pointed out that any acceptance of this proposal wouldbe bound to interrupt aerial reconnaissance work, and that thiswould be of great assistance to the enemy in preparing a suddenattack. Consequently, even though acceptance might give someclue to the date of the enemy&apos;s offensive, the War Cabinet felt thatit was inadvisable to accept the appeal.The War Cabinet decided that The question should be discussed with our Allies at the forth-coming meeting of the Supreme War Council.Man-Power.Poison Gas.6. The Secretary of State for War undertook to give the WarCabinet a statement on the present position in regard to man-power. - &apos;7. With reference to War Cabinet 355, Minute 10, the atten-tion of the War Cabinet was drawn to a suggestion in mr. churchill&apos;s Munitions Programme for 1919 (Paper G.T.-3835)to supplement our military preparations in 1919 by provision for agas attack on a very large scale.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that he hadthe whole of the questions raised in Mr. churchill&apos;s report underconsideration. Limitations, he pointed out, were placed on the offensive employment of poison gas by the fact that the forceemploying it was prevented from penetrating into the gassed area for a period of time sufficient to enable the enemy to organise hisdefence.It was suggested that the views of the Field-Marshal Com-manding-in-Chief in France should be ascertained on this subject.Tanks 8. With reference to the discussion on Tanks which took place-u^j-i at 10, Downing Street, on the 8th March, the Chief of the Imperial&apos;   3&apos; General Staff pointed out the difficulties which the defence would oppose to Tanks.    Low-flying aeroplanes might be defeated by our

The Deputy- First Sea Lord reported that a trawler had dropped ten depth charges on an enemy submarine off the coast of cornwall; large quantities of oil and bubbles were seen coming tothe surface. Fie also stated that a report had been received fromDover that on the 10th March a patrol boat felt a heavy explosionunder the water, and later a large oil patch was sighted; alsowreckage, which appeared to be the internal fittings of a sub-marine. In addition, documents were picked up giving particulars of trials of &quot; U.B. 58.&quot;Chant EnemyAeroplane Bombed.13. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that during a bombing-raid carried out by the Dunkirk patrol a giant enemy aeroplane,which had made a forced landing, was sighted on the ground and bombed.Attack on hospital ship.Iiiot at Antigua.14. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that the hospital shipGuildford Castle &quot; was attacked by an enemy submarine on the evening of the 10th instant in the Bristol Channel, at about thesame spot where the &quot; Glenart Castle &quot; was torpedoed.

The ship had a full complement of sick on board. the deputy First Sea Lord was ascertaining further particulars,a view to publication.with15.

With reference to War Cabinet 340, Minute 6, the Deputy-First Sea Lord undertook to ascertain the composition of the force which escorted the convoy out of which five ships were torpedoed inthe Mediterranean on the 6th February.Russia.17. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that hehad received some evidence which showed that German and austrian troops were moving on Odessa.The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that he had received atelegram from the Naval Attache, Petrograd, which said that theRussian ice-breaker &quot; Tarno &quot; deserted to Reval on the 5th March,own aeroplanes; &quot; camouflaged &quot; guns might be circumvented bysmoke and night attack; but land mines presented a problem of theutmost difficulty.
thus leaving the Fleet with only two ice-breakers. The battleshipshad been ordered to Cronstadt, but the crews wished to go bytrain. Orders had been issued to prepare the ships for deisitruc-tion, but definite action could not be relied upon.Stores at Archangel 18. With reference to War Cabinet 346, Minute 4, and Warand Murmansk.        Cabinet 357, Minute 1, the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs raised the question as to what action had been taken by thea Admiralty   to   protect   the  Allied   stores   at  Archangel  and&apos; X/-/. Murmansk.     He was of opinion that this question had a big5a bearing on the general policy of the Allies.The Deputy First Sea Lord said that arrangements werebeing made to send an armed icebreaker to Archangel if required.This boat would fly the White Ensign. British and Frenchcruisers were also on their way to Murmansk (War Cabinet 358,Minute 8).The Secretary of State for War then read a letter that hehad received from the French Military Attache, requesting thatwe should send ships to bring away the most urgent Allied storesnow ci\ t Archangel. The letter intimated that the French con-sidered their own stores to be the more important, and should bebrought away first.The War Cabinet were informed by the Deputy First sea lord that the question of the removal of stores at Archangel and murmansk was to be considered by the Allied Naval Council, andthe subject was therefore adjourned by the War Cabinet.Japanese - 19. With reference to War Cabinet  359,  Minute 11,   the intervention. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs explained the position atif/     the moment regarding Japanese intervention in Siberia.  Americav-c, \/ - had first acquiesced in the proposed enterprise, but  had  sincelr &apos; / \\&apos; reverted to her misgivings. In consequence of this change of attitude, our Ambassador in Tokyo had not acted on the instruc-tions conveyed to him by telegram (NO. 198 to Tokyo) on the 5thMarch. The Japanese Government therefore had not as yet been officially approached on the subject of intervention in Siberia, inthe character of mandatory of the Allies.. Mr. Balfour had, on the9th March, sent a further telegram to Sir C. Greene (No. 216),authorising him to proceed at once on the instructions conveyedin the previous despatch (No. 198). The only modification in theinstructions was that our Ambassador was to report to the ForeignOffice the results of his conversation with the Japanese Ministerfor Foreign A^ffairs before taking part with his French andItalian colleagues in any joint invitation to the Japanese Govern-ment.In the discussion that followed, the opinion was expressed that Japan was unlikely to act, in view of the lukewarmness of theAmerican attitude, and that the Japanese Government&apos;s state of mind could be inferred from Sir C. Greene&apos;s telegram No. 204, ofthe 7th March. It seemed that the situation was materiallyaltered. Not only had Japanese eagerness abated in consequenceof American reluctance, but most of the advice received fromRussia dissuaded us from encouraging or countenancing a japanese invasion - of Siberia, as certain to drive Russia intoleague with Germany.As against this view, it was urged that Russia, even ifanimated with hatred of Germany, was quite unable, withoutforeign assistance, to make qjyj sort of resistance to the Germans.General Knox and Captain Proctor were instanced as among thosewho considered the situation lost unless Japan acted, and actedsoon... There was little prospect of any hardening of the Russiansif left to themselves; and to wait for an. invitation from them to japan would be to wait for an uncertainty and, in any case, to wait too long.
The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to a twofoldrisk of the policy of Japanese intervention in Siberia: (a) Russianhatred, of Germany, a foundation it might be possible to build on,would be transferred to us, for letting loose Asia on a temporarilyprostrate Russia; (b) There was a possibility of a rift on a matterof cardinal policy between ourselves and the United States ofAmerica, to secure which was one of the aims of German policy.Japan in any case would not go far West, as she had ceased to feel confident that her Allies were on the winning side. We shouldnot prevail on her to go far enough to engage in serious armedconflict with the Germans. All we needed for our immediatepurpose was protection of the stores at Vladivostock. This could he done without the invasion of Siberia up to the Urals and running the risk of incurring all the odium and reaping none ofthe benefit.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed out thatit was early to assume that America would not go with us, andthat Japan would refuse to go West. He urged that the resultof our demarche at Tokyo should be awaited. If the present viewsof the United States of America, as expressed in telegram No. 929from. Washington, had, as might be inferred from a telegram(No. 73) from Sir W. Wiseman to Sir E. Drummond of the 6thMarch, already been communicated to Japan, we should obtain the considered opinion of the Japanese Government with the alterna-tives clearly before it.It was decided that The result of Sir C. Greene&apos;s conversation with the JapaneseMinister for Foreign Affairs should be awaited.Formation of 20. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theEastern Committee   Chief of the Imperial General Staff (Paper G.T.-3834).y It was pointed out that there were three Committees dealingdPrf/^O/i^.2jf% with what were really three aspects of one problem, and that eachfrequently deliberated without knowing what had been decided&quot;2t^-^r^ by the others, with results sometimes inclined to be incoherent.One of these Committees, the Middle East Committee,  was  a&quot;\ Cabinet Committee; of the others, the Russia Committee w7as aForeign Office. Committee, and the Persia Committee interdepart-, k     mental, with the Secretary  of  State  for  Foreign  Affairs  as,3 /     chairman.y &quot;-d * It was decided that one Committee should be formed of these three, and that, as it would have to co-ordinate the work of several departments, it should be a War Cabinet Committee; but it wasagreed that care must be taken to safeguard the Departmentalauthority and responsibility of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.The War Cabinet requested Lord Curzon to draft the Terms  of  Reference  to  thisCommittee.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March 11, 1918.
