British divisions on the italian front.1. WITH reference to War Cabinet 340, Minute 4, general harington made the following statement as to the situation on theItalian front. He stated that when the British and French divi-sions arrived the position was insecure, but it was then felt that ifthe Piave was lost it would be possible to hold the Vicenza line.Since then the situation had considerably improved, the position had been made much more secure, and the Italians had been encouraged by the presence of the British and French troops, andalso by the highly successful French attack which was carried out at the end of December 1917 (War Cabinet 309, Minute 10), andby our constant raids and activity.General Harington informed the War Cabinet that the bestassistance that could be rendered at the present moment to theItalian Army was to instruct them, so that they might profit by the lessons which we had learned during the war.   Their idea of con-ducting a defence had been to put all their troops in the front line,with little or no reserves in support.    With a view to changing the Italian methods, schools had been instituted, and as many as100 Italian officers attended each course, and there was every indi-cation that the Italians appreciated the instruction they received and were anxious to benefit by it.   They did not yet realise, how-ever, the need for serious training.   Up to the present the workof the Italian artillery had been bad, and they did not carry out any counter-battery work, or understand the working of barrageseither in offence or defence.   A. further fault, and perhaps the worst fault, in the Italian Army was the weakness of Staff workand the lack of control from Headquarters.   They were perfectlywilling to issue orders, but such orders were of an academic nature and often impossible of execution.     In this connection General.Harington pointed out that the failure of the attack on Asolone. was entirely due to  bad Staff work in changing the  hourof zero too late, but that more recent attacks had been far more promising.     He was of opinion that the Third italian army (the Due  d&apos;Aosta&apos;s)  was  very  good.      It  was  wellcommanded and better staffed than any of the others.   The first and Fourth Armies, especially the Alpinis and the Bersaglieritroops although the two armies had suffered heavy casualties--- were also good.    He thought, however, that the Italians were making a mistake in the way in which they were reorganisingthe Second Army, and, in support of that view, he mentioned thatthe other Italian armies did not place any trust in them.   On thewhole, he estimated that, since the retreat, the Italian Army had increased its efficiency by at least 40 per cent.General Harington mentioned that, as regards the twosectors held by the British, we were trying to organise the same a,smodels of defence; so that, if the necessity arose for our troops tobe transferred elsewhere, these sectors could successfully be held bytired or untrained Italian troops. The French were doing thesame as regards the organisation of the sectors they occupied.As regards any possibility of an enemy attack, general harington stated that there were no indications of suchbeingmade,and he was of opinion that one could not be carried out unless thesame was very highly organised; and, moreover, it should be impos-sibie, under the conditions of attack that might be expected, forany army to be driven back from the line of the Piave.Questioned as to the moral of the Austrian troops, general harington stated that, from those he had seen, he had gatheredthe impression that they were of poor quality and sick of thei war,and that it had not been the infantry that had been the cause ofany enemy success, but that such was entirely due to the work ofthe Austrian and German batteries.General Harington mentioned to the War Cabinet that he understood that General Diaz had under consideration the possi-bility of an offensive, but had not at present, as far as he was
The western front: Transfer ofGerman Divisions.2. With reference to War Cabinet 342, Minute 1, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff reported that two more german divisions had arrived on the Western front, making a total of 177.As regards the divisions in the front line and in reserve onthe Western front, the Allies had 99 divisions in the front line and63 in reserve, as against 112 German divisions in the front line and65 in reserve.Anglo-liussianMilitary ServiceAgreement.-  3l -V;3. With reference to War Cabinet 329, Minute 12, the WarCabinet had under consideration the Report of a Committee(Paper G.T.-3594) on the Anglo-Russian Military Service Agree-ment.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed out thatcompulsory enlistment of Russians into the British Army was impracticable, that a protest had been received from M. Litvinoffpractically denouncing the convention, and that information hadbeen received from Russia that this convention was causing greatirritation there and damaging British interests. Mr. Balfouradded that machinery existed in Russia for exempting Englishmenfrom joining the Russian Army, but that no machinery was prac-ticable here, and if the cases were referred to M. Litvinoff he wouldgive exemption to every applicant. Up to the present the ques-tion of releasing Russians already in the British Army had notarisen, but it was possible that the point might arise in the nearfuture, and Mr. Balfour thought it would be difficult to retain themen in the Army against their will, in view of Russia having madepeace, when the men in question had been conscripted. There wasone point, however, which arose in this connection, and that wasthat some of these men were not necessarily Bolsheviks; they might,for instance, be Ukrainians or Cossacks, in which case M. Litvinoffcould hardly claim their release, as he did not in any way representthe Ukrainian or Cossack Governments.Lord Derby mentioned that most of the Russians in theImperial Army were serving with the Canadians.Sir George Cave urged that these men should not be dis-charged from&apos; the Army, and pointed out, moreover, that to stopaware, approached General Plumer on the subject. His own view,however, was that, owing to the lack of training of the italian troops, only a limited offensive would be possible, and that, evenif they made an advance, their Staff work at present was such thatit would be difficult to control them if such advance was over an extended area.Questioned as to whether the number of British divisions in italy could be reduced, General Harington expressed the opinionthat the work we were now doing could be equally well done by three divisions instead of five, but was unaware what the proposedoffensive would require. He was further of opinion that theItalians could now spare for the Western front in France tengood divisions, as they had an Italian Army of no less than 688battalions. The strength of an Italian division was between10,000 and 12,000 men.As regards the reduction of the British divisions in Italy fromtwelve battalions to nine, General Harington said that the matter had been fully considered by General Plumer, and he was sure thatthe latter was strongly opposed, at the present stage, to any reduction in the number of battalions.The War Cabinet decided that ,y7^ The order for the reduction of our divisions to nine battalions/ ,   J&quot;2&apos; &apos;        should not apply to the divisions in Italy until such wasi%ll&apos;l/Ji(jyy*^ arranged between the Chief of the Imperial General Staff&apos; V and General Plumer.Or
recruiting would leave a large number of Russians in the East End,where there was bitter feeling against them, and where they wouldbe a constant source of trouble. He therefore recommended that,if practicable, these Russians should be shipped to their own country.It was suggested that the men should be called upon to join upforthwith, and if they failed to do so they should be informed thatthey would be expelled from the United Kingdom at the end of thewar. It was felt, however, in view of the difficulties that wereexperienced in passing the Aliens Act some few years ago, thatsuch a threa.t would be impossible of execution.The War Cabinet were of opinion that, if we had to break with the Bolsheviks, we should break on grounds which would be supported by International Law, and that to enforce the conven-tion under existing circumstances, by which we should be recruit-ing neutral subjects, would be indefensible.The War Cabinet therefore decided To stop recruiting of Russians for the moment, but not toreturn those who had already joined the Army, unlesscircumstances arose which necessitated a reconsideration of this latter point.Allied Peace Aims,4. The War Cabinet had a short discussion in regard to an amendment to be moved in Parliament by Mr. Snowden and others,inviting the House of Commons to express its regret at the decisionof the Supreme War Council at Versailles, which declared that theonly immediate task before the Allies was the prosecution of mili-tary effort, thus closing the door to the continuation of peace dis-cussions. The amendment urged that the Allies should formulateat once a joint statement of peace principles, to form a basis of an open Conference attended by all the belligerent nations.The Prime Minister and Lord Milner stated that M. Clemen-Clemenceau had wished the Supreme War Council to adopt a very detailed and definite statement of the peace aims of the Allies. Onscrutiny, however, of the draft that was ,put forward, it becamevery clear that such a statement would cause great difficulties,insomuch as in a joint declaration of peace aims each nationtended to put its own aims at a maximum. In these circumstances it had been agreed at Versailles that any statement on this subject should only be of a very general character.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should deal withthe matter in Parliament on the above lines.The IrishConvention.5. With reference to War Cabinet 321, Minute 18, the PrimeMinister informed the War Cabinet that during the past week hehad seen different sections of the Irish Convention. As a resulthe gathered that the Unionists were divided into two quite distinctgroups, one composed mainly of Southern Unionists and the other of the Ulster Party&apos;s representatives. The Nationalists were divided into at least three groups: Mr. Redmond did not agreewith Mr. Devlin, nor Mr. Devlin with Mr. Murphy. Outside theConvention stood the Sinn Feiners, who, though not represented in the Convention, had indirect influence upon the more extremesection of the Nationalists. He gathered, from all the interviews,that they were no longer fighting over the question of Parliamen-tary union, but mainly over\the question of Customs. Retentionof Customs had become the flag to which the Nationalists wererallying. The Belfast Labour men whom he saw were all infavour of a settlement, but he gathered from Sir Edward Carsonthat these Labour men did not accurately represent the views ofthe Protestant workmen in Belfast.
Mr. Barnes stated that he doubted Sir Edward Carson&apos;scontention, and added that he had seen the Labour men, who had informed him that if a public meeting were held in Belfast theywould be able to carry the great mass of Belfast labour Avith themin favour of a settlement.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had learnedfrom Mr. Hugh Barrie, M.P., that one of the Labour men,namely, Mr-. Waugh, was not in favour of a settlement.The Chief Secretary, however, expressed a belief that Mr.Waugh did honestly desire a settlement.Lord Southborough stated that the majority of the Labourmen were pledged to sign the so-called 75 per cent, corn-promise, which had been proposed by Lord Midleton, andseconded by Lord Dunraven. He added that it was verydifficult to secure pure Labour representatives in Belfastof the same type as British Labour representatives, asthe position of Labour Leaders as Labour men was over-ruled by their political proclivities. Labour questions were apt to be pushed aside in the minds of the Belfast workmen by the oldfeeling for Protestant and racial ascendancy. However, there wasa distinction between the Labour men and the rest of the Ulsterrepresentatives. The Labour men appeared to be plenipoten-tiaries, whereas the Ulster men were bound by an external body to whom they had to refer for orders. The Labour men haddared to put their heads into the noose of personal responsibility,which the other Ulster representatives did not dare to do. It was apparent that, as things stood, the Ulster representatives wouldtake no initiative whatever, but that, if the 75 per cent, majorityscheme recommended itself to the Government, the Ulster represen-tatives would be willing to submit it to their people for considera-tion. He thought the Cabinet might like to know how the questionof Customs had become the acute question upon which the fate ofthe Convention seemed now to depend. There had been, in the firstplace, something approaching a general acceptance of the principleof a Dublin Parliament, of the principle that in such a Parliamentthere should be special arrangements for Ulsters protection, andthat there should be sufficient financial resources to enable the parliament to work. The 75 per cent, were invited to agreethat internal taxation and excise should be left to the IrishParliament. A question had then been put to the Nationalists asto whether they admitted the principle that a contribution fromthe Irish revenues should be made to the Imperial Exchequer.The Nationalists had agreed to this. It was further agreed by the majority that a portion of the Customs revenue shouldbe earmarked for the purpose of forming this contribu-tion to the Imperial Exchequer. Discussion and divisionof opinion had subsequently arisen as to what should bedone with the balance of the Customs receipts. Roman CatholicPrelates had made a demand that all the Customs revenues shouldbe paid into the Irish Exchequer, and a portion handed toEngland as an Imperial contribution- The amount of this contribution had not been fixed, and it was difficult to see how itcouhd be fixed during the continuance of the war. However,directly the principle of contribution to Imperial Funds was admitted, it became clear that a new partner, with which theConvention was not in touch, must be consulted, namely, theBritish Government. One of the main objects of the present discussions was, therefore, to ascertain the views of the BritishGovernment upon this question of Customs and Imperial con-tribution. The non-Nationalist representatives appeared to bedetermined against handing over Customs to the Irish Parlia-ment. A number of the Nationalists, on the other hand, demandednot merely the right to administer the Customs revenue, but to fix and vary the Customs duties. The whole question had been[1365-345] C
complicated moreover by the&apos; fact that it had never been possible tostate, with anything like general acceptance, what was the trueIrish revenue. Lord MacDonnell, for many years Under-secretary in Ireland, had told the Convention that in his long years of experience he had never been able to ascertain what the Irishrevenue really was.Mr. Walter Long stated that he felt convinced that themajority of those who thought with him in Parliament would never agree to the handing over of Customs to an IrishParliament.The Chief Secretary for Ireland stated that he thought theCabinet should realise that, if the deliberations of the Conventionbrought no fruition, the Government would be faced with thenecessity of carrying on the government of Ireland by force.Influences were at work in the western counties which threatenedthe operation of all ordinary administration. Large numbers of young men had been kept in the country against their will, andwere organised in such a manner as to make the carrying on ofthe government in the ordinary way quite impossible should there be no prospect of a settlement. In his opinion it was clear thatany man or section which stood out against a settlement hadthereby laid upon them the duty of assuming responsibility for thefuture government of Ireland. If there was a prospect of asettlement, there would be peace and he thought a certainty ofimprovement in Irish conditions. If, however, the prospect of asettlement failed, matters would drift, into a state of affairs which could hardly be controlled.On the point of giving Customs to the Irish Parliament, theChancellor of the Exchequer and Lord Milner both expressed theview that the shadow was more formidable than the substance,and that, provided treaty-making power was not conceded,Customs might conceivably be left to the Irish Parliament. TheChancellor of the Exchequer added that he gathered that theUlstermen held the view that nothing could come of the Conven-tion unless the British Government gave a lead as to what wasthe Government view.The Prime Minister invited Prbfessor Adams to make suggestions in regard to what the Prime Minister should say, onbehalf of the Government, to the seventeen representatives of all sections of the Convention that afternoon.Professor Adams stated that, in his opinion, the first thing to say was that an All-Ireland Parliament was the only basisof a solution. There was evidence that the Ulstermen wereprepared to discuss the question of safeguards if they felt thatthey were urged by the British Government to accept the principle in Imperial interests. Neither the Southern Unionists nor the nationalists would stay a day longer in the Convention unless there was a prospect of Ulster coming into the Dublin Parliament.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that this should form the basis of the Government proposal.Professor Adams then stated that, in regard to the Customsdifficulty, several alternatives were possible. In the first place, itmight be pointed out to the Nationalist representatives that, bvclaiming the power to vary the Customs imposed by the british parliament during the continuance of the war, they incurred therisk of breaking up the Convention. He thought that an alternativeway out of the difficulty would be to inform the Convention repre-sentatives that a Royal Commission would be established at theend of the war to settle the amount of the contribution to be madeby Ireland to the Imperial Exchequer, provided that such con-tribution were fixed for a period-of years at a definite sum, andthat this Commission should examine the whole questionof Customs. At any rate, until the Commission reports, theBritish Government&apos; should fix provisionally the amount of the
Imperial contribution. Professor Adams added that a letter fromSir Horace Plunkett showed that he took the view that thePrime Minister should avoid making a detailed statement to the joint meeting of representatives of different sections of theConvention. He thought that the Prime Minister should confinehimself to making a general statement which should be followedby a more detailed written statement which could be read to theConvention at their re-assembly on Tuesday next.Lord Southborough thought it important that, in addition to seeing the seventeen representatives, the Prime Minister should see the Ulster section separately at a subsequent meeting. TheConvention were most anxious to obtain some definite proposals from the Ulster members which might be discussed; up to dateno suggestions whatever had been put forward by them. If theparties were received together the difficulty was that, the moment the question of Customs was examined in detail, the pitch wasqueered as. far as the Unionist representatives were concerned, andnothing would be got from them.Mr. Long added that any offer at this stage by the Govern-ment of the Customs, would be regarded by the Nationalists as apolitical victory which would make the position of the Unionistsalmost, if not quite, impossible.The Prime Minister then stated that, with the concurrence of his colleagues, he proposed to make a general statement to thejoint meeting of the different sections that afternoon, to befollowed by further conferences with the various sections. Atthe joint meeting he would point out the gravity of the position,both from the Imperial point of view and from the point of viewof Irish nationalism. He would point out that, as long as thewar lasted, Ireland had to be governed, and that, from the Irishpoint of view, it Avas of the utmost urgency that a settlement should be reached. He would make clear to the joint meeting that the Government took the view that during the war a settle-ment was only possible which involved the following three cardinalpropositions :  (a.) That there should be one Parliament for the whole ofIreland, sitting in Dublin;(6.) That while the war continued, Customs could not be handed over to the Irish Parliament;(c.) That during the continuance of the war, the control ofthe   police   must   be   retained   by   the   ImperialGovernment.The War Cabinet agreed to the procedure suggested by thePrime Minister.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.
