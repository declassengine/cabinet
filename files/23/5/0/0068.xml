THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that bothnorth and south of the Somrne heavy fighting had taken placeon the 27th instant. The enemy in certain directions had made some progress, but vigorous counte[--attacks by British,Australian, and New Zealand divisions are reported to have greatlyrestored the situation. South of the Somme our troops and theFrench were also heavily attacked, but had maintained their position except for the capture of Montdidier by the Germans.   The
capture of this place affected the detraining of the French, reserves,which was now being earned out at a point as close as possible toMontclidier as well as at St. Just, where a parallel, line exists at a distance of 10 miles from Montdidier. The French General Head-quarters had stated that they were satisfied as regards the situationin the vicinity of Montdidier.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff explained the plan onwhich General Fayolle was operating. Field-Marshal Lord Frenchand the Chief of the Imperial General Staff both considered that thesituation had not deteriorated. The Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff stated that seventy-eight German, divisions had been, identifiedon the battle front, four more had probably arrived yesterday, andthe Germans had twenty-two fresh divisions in reserve. He men-tioned that four United States divisions were replacing fourFrench divisions, with a view to the latter being utilised, ifnecessary, on the battle front. He further stated that the WarCabinet, in taking into consideration the situation, must bear inmind that in the near future, when the Germans get their heavy guns up, the very important railway junction at Amiens will be under fire, which will be extremely serious.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff further stated that theenemy was to-day making an attack east of Arras.   Sir &quot;douglas haig, however, anticipated this attack, and had divisions in reserve-   behind the line.Mesopotamia. 2. The Chief of   the Imperial General Staff   stated that atelegram had been received from the General Officer commanding in Mesopotamia to the effect that our operations on the Euphratesjt had been completely successful.   On the evening of the 26th March/ &quot;3 - the enemy&apos;s position north of  Khan Baghdad! was carried byyi/f- &apos; assault, and our cavalry, by means of  a wide movement, had established itself in the rear of the Turks astride the Aleppo road.The attempt of the enemy to break through the cavalry failed,without heavy losses, and practically the whole of the Turkish force on the right bank of the Euphrates below Haditha was capturedand destroyed. The pursuit of the fugitives is in progress, arLCl Upto the present prisoners are estimated at 3,000, including 200 officers,2,000 rifles, 10 guns, many machine guns, GOO animals, and other, booty spread over a wide region were also taken. Our casualtiesy.   are very slight.Naval Losses. 3. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that H.M.S. &quot; Kale,&quot;&quot; Exe,&quot;&apos;and &quot; Wavenev &quot; had passed into one of our minefields, andthat H.M.S. &quot;Kale&quot;&apos; had sunk and U.M.S. &quot; Exe&quot; had been damaged, one officer and forty-two men being lost from the formerand three officers and two men from the latter. The vessels wereoff their authorised course and in a prohibited area. A. Court ofy  Enquiry is being held.Bombing raids . 4. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that bombing raids hadbeen carried out from Dunkirk on the night of the 26th March onthe railway communications in the rear of the enemy battle-front, atotal of over 6 tons of bombs being dropped.   He added that a raidy  was also carried out on Ostend seaplane base.Ireland:compulsory military Service.5. With, reference to War Cabinet 375, Minute 2, the PrimeMinister informed the War Cabinet that, with a view to obtainingadditional evidence as to the feeling that might be expected inIreland in regard to conscription and its effects on the Convention,he had asked Sir Edward Carson and Sir James Campbell, the
Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, to attend the meeting for the purpose ofgiving the War Cabinet the benefit of their opinions on these matters.Sir James Campbell said that he had been considering thematter anxiously, and some two years ago there had been threeopportunities when, in his opinion, conscription could have beenput in force in Ireland without serious trouble arising, but that advantage had not been taken of them at the time. The most favourable of these three had been after the rebellion. Since then the position had vitally changed. During the past two years a newclass had grown up, and the late backbone of the Irish disaffection,namely, farmers and their sons, had given place to a body composedof shop assistants, clerks, Government officials, school teachers, &amp;c,who were more or less educated and had ideas of their own, andalso had the characteristic of being devoid of fear. It was also tobe borne in mind that emigration during the past four years from ireland had been stopped, and that whereas before the war therate of emigration was 30,000 a year, it had only been 40,000 in thepast four years, which left a balance of those who would haveemigrated, &quot;if they could, of SO,000. Of this latter figure, 50,000might be taken as representing young men of military age who hadnot the slightest intention of fighting. As regards the educated and semi-educated class referred to above, it must be understood thatit was not bluff on their part when they defied the Magistratesbefore whom they were brought ; they did not even take the troubleto defend themselves, as in the past, and claimed that they werehaled before a British Court to which they owed no allegiance.Sir James Campbell was convinced that conscription could only nowbe enforced in Ireland at the cost of tremendous bloodshed. Nationalmilitary service, if applied to Ireland at all, must be of universalapplication, and no system of exemptions by tribunal was practic-able. Further, it must be borne in mind that, if conscription was introduced, practically the whole of the clergy, from the Arch-bishops downwards, would take the field against the British Govern-ment, and the whole of the Nationalist officials and all public bodieswould also go against the Government, as well as certain sections in ulster, inasmuch as the agricultural population of Ulster objected to conscription, and as regards voluntary recruiting, hart done little better than the other parts of Ireland. If it was a question of onlytaking men who could be depended upon, the numbers gained bythe introduction of conscription would, in his opinion, be very small.Questioned as to why the situation should have changed so much asregards conscription since the rebellion, Sir James Campbell statedthat, after the rebellion, the people generally were gravely concerned at the failure of the same and the penalties to which they consequentlyrendered themselves liable ; and if conscription had then been intro-duced, the tendency would have been to look upon it as an act ofclemency in lieu of punishment authorised by law, and further thenumber of Sinn Feiners at that date was small compared with thepresent,A suggestion was made that Sir James Campbell should get into touch with a few of the leading men in Ireland whose viewsmight be of help, and discuss the matter of conscription with them ;but this course was considered undesirable, as it might lead to the break-up of the Convention.Sir Edward Carson stated that he did not profess to know thesituation as regards the South and West of Ireland, and he did not feel that he could go against the views expressed by Sir JamesCampbell, whose whole heart was in the war, and who had formerlystrongly favoured compulsory service for Ireland. Tie thought thatit would be desirable, as a first step, to get the Bill, which wouldresult in much opposition in the House of Commons, but could be passed by closure. That, however, would cause tremendousopposition in Ireland, and the Nationalists would probably endeavourto get back under their banner the other Irish parties. He was ofopinion that, with the strong opposition of the Sinn Feiners, the[1365-376] ^ B 2
number of reliable men that could be got would be very small, asat least two-thirds to be obtained would be anti-British. He wastherefore forced to the conclusion, with much regret, that the resultof conscription in Ireland would be such that its introduction wasnot worth contemplating, in view of the disturbances that would be caused. He felt that if conscription was made applicable only toUlster, which would tend to create the feeling that one party wasbeing bled at the expense of another, there would be trouble amongstthe farmers of that county. While expressing views in the abovesense on the question as viewed from a purely Irish standpoint,Sir Edward Carson, when asked by Lord Curzon to give his opinionfrom an Imperial point of view, agreed that if the British Govern-ment found themselves unable to get men from Great Britainwithout enforcing conscription in Ireland, the question became avery different one.In view of the effect which conscription would have on theConvention, Mr. Duke suggested that the two matters might betreated separately, namely, that the Convention was one matter and part of our permanent policy and should be kept in the forefront,and, secondly, conscription under entire military control should betreated as a secondary matter, dependent on the acceptance of theConvention. He stated that he was under the impression that a defence Committee, appointed by the Convention, was renderinga separate Report as regards military control in Ireland, and thatthe Imperial Parliament was held to be responsible. Mr. Dukementioned that, as far as his experience of Ireland went, it was not impossible to carry out in that country measures which weredemonstrable just.[At this point Sir Edward Carson left the.meeting.]In the general discussion that followed, it was mentioned (a.) That since the rebellion the number of Sinn Eeiners hadmultiplied by at least twenty or thirty.(b.) That the question of conscription had now become an imperial one, and that we could only maintain ourposition in the war by further sacrifices and effort.(c) That directly conscription for Ireland was broached asbeing probable, the Convention would break up, andwe should have the whole of Ireland against us.(d.) That the Irish, even if conscripted, would not light, andwould be a weakness instead of a strength, and that itwas possible they might even shoot their officers. Inthis connection, however, the military authorities presentheld the view that, if Irishmen were once conscripted,spread ovorthe whole of the British Army, and subjected to discipline, the likelihood of their failing to fight wellwas remote.(e.) That, iu deciding as to conscription or otherwise, and its effects on the Convention, our position as regards theUnited States and the Dominions must be carefully borne in mind.(/.) If further conscription was forced on Great Britain andconscription not applied to Ireland, the British public would not submit to the passing of legislation based onthe Report of the Convention.(g.) That the Report of the Convention might be accepted byParliament, subject to conscription being enforced asregards Ireland.(h.) That the Government are pledged to Home Rule in theterms of the Prime Ministers letter to the Convention,and that, if there was a substantial measure of agreementwith such letter on the part of the Convention, the logicalorder would be first to pass Home liule, so removing a
WC 376wrong, or an imaginary wrong, to tlie people of Ireland,and then to bring in conscription.(i.) That provision might be made in the Bill for the Govern-ment Lo take power by Order in Council to extendconscription to Ireland, and not to put such power intooperation until the Report of the Convention had beenaccepted by the Government.0. With reference to War Cabinet 375, Minute 3, Sir AucklandGedcles stated that his proposal to raise 450,000 men in Englandcould not be carried out without tremendous industrial disturbance,and it was mentioned, in connection with taking a quota of menaAvay from agriculture, that, as compared with 1916, some 4,000,000additional acres of land had been ploughed in the United Kingdom,and that any withdrawal in that direction in the near future would be disastrous to our agricultural policy. Sir Auckland Geddes continuedthat to obtain these numbers it would be essential to do away withTribunals. He pointed out that in next May or June there wouldbe a big gap as regards drafts for the Army. At the present momenthe was putting on every possible pressure, and the number of recruits was improving, but that every day lost in bringing forward a Bill for extending compulsory military service meant a further gapas regards the intake of men for drafts. He added that, as far ashe had gathered when touring the country, the British public wouldnot accept an extension of the age to 50 with no Tribunals unlessconscription was applied to Ireland. He stated that, as regards hisnumbers, he had made allowance for an increase in the numbe semployed in shipyards. There was no real reservoir of fightingmen in the luxury trades now, and to obtain the men required, ifthe mines were to be maintained, important trades other than directwar trades would have to be very seriously curtailed.As regards the question of introducing to Parliament any extension of the Military Service Act, a view was expressed that itwas desirable to defer the introduction of any Bill until the Reportof the Convention had been received. It was stated that its receiptmight be expected on or about the 4th April, and that therefore itwould be desirable to defer the meeting of Parliament from the 2nduntil the 9th April. As against any delay, it was urged that thefeeling in the country at the puesent rnoment was such that any measures introduced forthwith into Parliament with a view to strengthening our armed forces in the lield wotdd have much betterprospects of being passed speedily through both Houses than if therewere delay, and the situation had cleared somewhat.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported, however,that it was improbable that the situation would have finally clearedby 9th April. Pie urged with the utmost emphasis, and asked thatit might be placed on record, that from a military point of viewevery single clay of delay in introducing new measures for additionalmen was dangerous, and that each day now was of value. Pieadded, with equal emphasis, that this crisis Avas only the first of several, and possibly not even the most deadly.The Secretary of State for War and Field-Marshal Lord Frenchsupported General Wilson&apos;s views on the military importance of early action.The War Cabinet, after deliberating amongst themselves,decided that Parliament should not be summoned to meet next Tuesday,2nd April, 1918. (See also War Cabinet 376 a, where lord milner&apos;s dissent from this conclusion is recorded.)
Proposed Lowering 7. The general view was expressed that the feeling of this of Age Limit. country was such that to lower the age of recruiting to 17 wasuyy- 3 J?      y&apos; impracticable.Assistance by united states forces in France.371y75-,yS. With reference to War Cabinet 371, Minute 8, the PrimeMinister read a telegram, which had arrived during the meeting,from Mr. Baker, in which he recorded that the following action wasbeing taken by General Pershing :  (a.) The four American divisions were being put immediatelyinto the trenches in order to relieve French divisions.Three regiments of engineer troops were being sent toassist Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, and furtherdivisions would be sent as soon as transportation was available.In the case of American divisions under orders to leavethe United States of America, the infantry would besent first.(6.)(c.)The &quot;War Cabinet expressed gratification at the prompt action taken by Mr. Baker and General Pershing.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March 28, 1918.oll
