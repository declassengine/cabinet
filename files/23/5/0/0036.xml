WITH reference to War Cabinet 343, the Prime minister stated, that, after the Meeting of the War Cabinet on the previous evening, at which it had been decided to take action with a view tothe seizure of the press of the &quot; Morning Post,&quot; the matter hadbeen further discussed at an informal meeting, at which the HomeSecretary was present, and certain legal and other objections hadbeen considered. He had therefore suspended action on the decisionof the War Cabinet,, and had asked Sir George Cave to place himself in communication with the Solicitor-General and to make a report as to what action they advised.The War Cabinet agreed that If the question was raised in Parliament a reply should be givenin the sense that the question was being examined by thelegal advisers of the Government.The Establishmentof an Inter-allied general Eeserve:The Question of publicity.2. With reference to War Cabinet 338, Minute 3, the WarCabinet discussed briefly the attitude to be taken up in parliament in regard to the establishment of an Inter-Allied General Reserve.It was pointed out that the &quot; Morning Post &quot; had given so muchpublicity to the plan that there was a good deal to be said in favourof a public statement being made in regard to it. On the otherhand, it was urged that a public statement would have to be more definite and would be far more authoritative than what had leakedout in the &quot; Morning Post.&quot;The War Cabinet were reminded that, in his original statement in regard to the Supreme War Council, the Prime Minister had[136o-344]
laid some stress on the fact that the Council would have no executive powers, and that it would have no Operations Department attachedto it.    Parliament would, in all probability, wish to know whetherthis position had been departed from, and, if so, why.The War Cabinet agreed that If the Prime Minister was pressed on the question, he shouldpoint out to Parliament that, since the setting up of theSupreme War Council, the whole military situation hadbeen entirely changed by the decision of the Bolshevistsand the Ukraine not to continue the war ; that very greatenemy forces had now been released, which were being concentrated on the Western front; that this had necessi-tated the concerting of arrangements by the Allies for greater concentration of force at any threatened point;and that, consequently, the Supreme War Council had decided on an arrangement for the control of the Reserves,which involved some extension of the powers of the military representatives.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,February 12, 1918.
