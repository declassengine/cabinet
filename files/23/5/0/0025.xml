Air Raid on london.REFERRING to the air raid on London during the previous night, Major-General Ashmore said that three parties of Germanaeroplanes, totalling between 12 and &quot;15 machines, crossed the coast,but that, according to bis information, only three to five of these machines reached London. One German machine was engaged by our airmen and was destroyed at Brookford on its return journeyover Essex. General Ashmore reported that we had 70 machinesup during the raid, and that three or four of our airmen managed to engage the Gothas at quite close quarters. This showed a great improvement in effort on previous raids. General Ashmore expressedthe opinion that when we had better search-lights, which were expected shortly, and when our airmen, who were improving everyday, had had a little more practice, the Germans would find great difficulties when making a raid on London.With regard to casualties, Sir George Cave stated that he was afraid between 40 and 50 people had been killed and a numberwounded. There had been a stampede at Bishopsgate Goods Station,where women and children had been trampled to death.The opinion was expressed that if this panic was mentioned ina press report, attention should be drawn to the fact that thestampede occurred among foreign-born inhabitants.Sir Edward Henry reported that the greatest number of casulties had occurred in consequence of a direct hit on an air-raidshelter in Long Acre, 22 people being killed and 87 wounded. Hethen gave details as to where other bombs had fallen.The question was asked as to whether it was advisable to mention casualties in official communiques.Sir George  Cave pointed   out that if  this  were  not  doneexaggerated figures of casualties were bound to be spread about.The Cabinet decided that A press announcement should  be issued as to casualties, ifpossible before the House of Commons met that afternoon.The Western Front:Transfer ofGerman Divisions..y2. With reference to War Cabinet 328, Minute 5, the Director ofMilitary Intelligence reported that two more German divisions had arrived on the Western front, one from Russia and one from Italy,making a total of 170 German divisions opposed to the Franco-British forces in France.Austrian MotorBatteries.3. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that confirma-rion had been received that Austrian motor batteries were now inthe Lens area, but there was no indication of the presence of otherAustrian troops.The Italian Front.v/4. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that one anda half Austrian divisions had arrived from Roumahia on the italian front, making forty-four Austrian divisions on that j front in all.There were not more than four German divisions now on the italian front.The Hejaz.5. The Director of Military Intelligence reported Arab activity on the Hejaz Railway. The Arabs had occupied Tafileh, south ofKerek. The Director of Military Intelligence said he thought theTurks would try and reoccupy this place, as they were ratherworried about the situation of JKerek, which was a great centre ofwheat supply.
yEast Africa. 6. The Director  of Miiitarvcolumns in Portuguese East A hie;west, and  that  the  enemy  was  retiring toJ probably be forced into the Lujenda district.Intelligence   reported  that  twohe east atMtarika. and wouldang from the east and loss of 7. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that the old gunboatH.M.S. &quot;Hazard.&quot; H.M.S. &quot;Hazard&quot; was sunk on the morning of the 28th instant,as the result of a collision with a hospital transport ;*t theeastern entrance of Portsmouth Harbour. A Court of Inquiry hadalready been instituted.The &quot; Goeben &quot; and&quot; Breslau.&quot;y8. With reference to War Cabinet 331, Minute S, ibn * deputy first Sea Lord reported that our aircraft had been unable to locate the &quot; Goeben &quot; on the 28th instant, and had reporteddefinitely that she was no longer at Nagara. Our aircraft had alsosearched the Dardanelles and the Sea of Marmora, but without result, and it was probable that the &apos;; Goeben &quot; had made good herescape to. Constantinople. The Deputy First Sea Lord statedthat the Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean proposed to defer his report on the &quot; Goeben &quot; and &quot; Breslau &quot; operations until he had received moie information with regard to the &apos;: Goeben. &apos;Provision and payment of oversea Garrisonsafter the War.had before them a memorandum by thedealing with the maintenance of overseaif)eace9. The War- CabinetSecretary of State for Waigarrisons in the period immediately following the conclusion(Paper G.T.-3465).The Adjutant-General explained that the oversea garrisons were almost entirely composed of non-regular troops whom it would notbe safe to withdraw until reliefs were available. By October nextthere would be only 85.000 men liable to serve beyond the duration of the war. the majority of whom are warrant or N.C. Officers.Before the war the oversea garrisons numbered about 1.10,000.The Army Council thought it would be possible to call for volunteerswho would undertake to serve for, say, two or three years after thewar, preferably single men. These volunteers would be given twomonths&apos; leave, and then would be drafted into units selected forgarrison duty in India, Singapore, Hong Kong, Aden, Egypt, Malta,Gibraltar, the West Indies, and similar stations.Mr. Forster said that if such a policy were adopted it would benecessary for the War Cabinet to decide whether the recentlyincreased rates of pay (and separation allowances), which are for the duration of the war, should be continued to those who volunteeredfor the period of two or three years. He thought it would be easier to obtain volunteers to replace the garrisons now, while the war wason, than when peace was in sight.Lord Islington urged that the matter was one of theimportance for the Government of India, and one on which it wotbe desirable to consult the Commander-in-chief in India.General Whigham reminded the War Cabinet that the Terri-torial Forces had been in India for about three years, and that whenpeace came there would be a justifiable demand put forward thatgreatestuldThe opinion was expressed that the Arabs were very backwardin pursuing operations against the Turkish force at Medina.The Director- of Miiitarv Intelligence was requested To enquire into the position there and to report as to theinformation in possession of the War Office on the matter.
they should be brought home. Some interim arrangement would therefore be necessary to provide continuity in the garrison of India,until we were able to see more clearly what the character and size of our future army be. He suggested that we should be prepared tocontinue the existing rates of pay as a, temporary war measure, tocover the transition pepiod.It was pointed out that the question of demobilisation of the garrisons referred to would be affected by the tonnage available.In view of the recognised importance of the bearing of thisquestion on India, the War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for War and the Acting Secretary ofState for India should further consider the question, inconsultation with the Government of India, and report later to the War Cabinet.War priorities committee:Air PolicyCommittee.10. Lord Curzon undertook to preside at the meetings of the, War Priorities Committee and of the Air Policy Committee duringthe absence of General Smuts.Publication inDominionNewspapers of a weekly review ofthe War Situation.11. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by-Mr. Long, regarding the publication in Dominion newspapers of a weekly review of the War Situation (Paper G.T.-3426). Theproposal contained in it was approved, and the War Cabinet decidedthat The Colonial Office, in conjunction with the Secretariat of theWar Cabinet, should prepare a weekly telegram on theWar Situation, for the Dominion press, and that this weeklysurvey should also be communicated to the War AimsCommittee for the benefit of the home provincial news-^ papers.Live-stock Policyand Feeding-stuffsPosition.12. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Agriculture, covering a memorandumdealing with the serious shortage of concentrated foods for live-stock,which it was proposed to issue to the public (Paper G.T.-3434).Mr. Prothero said it was necessary to impress farmers with the grave situation which had arisen, and that it had been thought itwould be more effective to supply definite figures rather than generalstatements. The disclosures made in the memorandum were undoubtedly of an alarming character. On the other hand, it had tobe remembered that the figures dealt only with concentrated foods,whereas live-stock largelv depend also on roots, hay, and straw, ofwhich the season&apos;s supply had been generally favourable. The reasonfor the present concentrated feeding-stuffs position lay in the largedecrease of imports.Mr. Long thought that, in the present state ofit would be undesirable to publish the figuresmemorandum.Mr. Munro btlieved that an appeal made to  the Scottishfarmers, even with the details omitted, would elicit a good response.The War Cabinet decided that public opinion,given   in   theThe publication of the memorandum should be authorised, onthe understanding that the President of the Board ofAgriculture should revise the memorandum in the light ofthe discussion, omitting in particular the figures given inSection I.
oImports from South 13. On the question of imported substitutes, Mr. Long calledAfrica, the attention of the War Cabinet to the tonnage available in ships now in South African ports, owing to the recent arrangementsresulting in a decreased export of wool. He suggested that the space thus released might be used to import maize and other food-stuffs to this country.The War Cabinet invited Mr. Long to discuss the matter with the Shipping Controller.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,January 29, 19 L8.
