The Western Front.German Attack :The PresentPosition.1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that he hadreceived information from France to the effect that the enemy had occupied the villages of Davenscourt and Laboissiere, which broughtthem to within three miles of Montdidier, where the French weredetraining. No details were yet available to enable an opinion to heformed as to the seriousness of this information. It would be embarrassing to the French reinforcements if this railway fell intothe enemy&apos;s hands.On the British front the position appeared for the moment to bequieter, except for an attack at Bucquoy by the 3rd German Guards,which did not appear to have made much progress.Ireland:CompufsoryMilitary Service.376-2. With reference to War Cabinet 374, Minute 12, the WarCabinet further considered the application of compulsory militaryservice to Ireland, and had before them a memorandum by theGeneral Officer Commanding-in-Ohief, Irish Command, togetherwith observations upon it by General Byrne (Paper G.T.-4049).The Prime Minister outlined the proposals put forward by theMinister of National Service for increasing the available man-powerof the Kingdom. These proposals, if they all materialised, should furnish 555,000 men from Great Britain, and .150,000 from Ireland,in all about 700,000 men. The numbers from Great Britain weremade up as follows : -Men exempted by Tribunals : In Grade other Grades   ...Reserved occupations, if drastically combedout    ... ... ... ...AgricultureMining (in addition to the recent 50,000)By raising the age to 50 (in Grade I) ...Bv lowering the age to 1775,00075,000150,000... 100,000... 25,000... 50,000... 110,000... 120,000555,000Such numbers were based on the assumption that the situation was thoroughly bad, and that the nation Avas bound to make a supreme effort. Clergymen and ministers of religion were included,but no further men were included from shipbuilding nor fromtransport. It was not intended that boys aged 17 should be sent overseas, but that they should be trained at home in order to takethe place of others who might be sent abroad.The Prime Minister next summarised, for the benefit of thosewho had not been present, the views exj)resseci at previous discussed-cussions by Field-Marshal Lord French, as well as the views expressed to him personally by General Sir Bryan Mahon andGeneral Byrne (War Cabinet 374, Minute 1.2). The Prime minister suggested that two alternatives presented themselves : (a.) Ireland could be told, &quot; Come and fight, and without any loss of time we will give you Home Rule on the basis ofthe Convention Report&quot; ; that is to say, beginning by saying that their nationality was recognised, and theright of self-determination given them, but that theymust light for the Empire ;or -(6.) We should say to Ireland, &quot;Are you prepared to fight forthis country in this emergency ? &quot; Ireland might reply,&quot;We will fight if you give us self-government.&quot; Onthe other hand, if Ireland said, &quot; No, under no conditions
QoWC 375will we fight,&quot; then it would be hopeless to inviteParliament to take its thoughts away from the war inorder to carry through a Home Rule measure.   .The Chief Secretary for Ireland expressed the view that itwould be impossible to extend the Military Service Act to ireland in such a way as to help the war; it would be a complete change ofpolicy; it would unite all Catholics and Nationalists against us.General Mahon believed that, sooner or later, .150,000 men could begot out. of Ireland, but in his (Mr. Dnke&apos;s) view we might almost aswell recruit Germans. He believed the result -would be the loss ofIreland. He suggested that, after the conclusion of the Convention,it might be possible to obtain powers, by amendment of the MilitaryService Act, to apply a process similar to the Militia Ballot byOrder in Council for the maintenance of the nine Irish regiments.The Ballot could be applied equally over the country, beginning with the age class 20-25, which probably offered least resistance.Generals Mahon and Byrne expressed the view that this method would require exactly the same machinery as the larger proposal,but that it would . disarm some part of the opposition. Theadvantage of this scheme was that only a proportion of themen would be taken, and that those that remained would be soglad to have escaped that they would not make trouble. It would benecessary, simultaneously with this arrangement, to give legislativeeffect to the recommendations of the Convention. It. was fallaciousto draw analogies from the fact that the Germans had made the hostileelements within their Empire fight against us. The existence of aconscript system over many years made such analogies inapplicable.The Secretary of State for War pointed out that Mr. Duke&apos;proposal would involve the incorporation of many dangerous menin the Irish units instead of spreading them throughout the Army.Field-Marshal Lord French agreed with Lord Derby that thiswould be most undesirable, although it would be less objectionableto put them into battalions than into divisions, as the battalionscould be more easily mixed with loyal troops.Mr. Churchill was rather attracted by Mr. Duke&apos;s suggestion,because it recognised nationality, and he would be inclined tosupport it if it meant that from 70,000 to $0,000 men would be forthcoming with the goodwill of the rest of the population. Hethought the Government should declare its policy clearly in advance,and put its demands sufficiently high in order to have something to concede.Mr. Walsh said the Government was certain to be opposed byMr. Dillon. On the other hand, he did not believe the man-powerproposals now put forward could be applied in England iiuless atthe same time conscription was applied in Ireland. On the questionof calling up boys of 17, he was certain that such a proposal would meet with the most strenuous opposition iu the ranks of labour.There would be strikes among the miners against the lowering ofthe age, but they would offer no opposition to the raising of it.The War Cabinet felt that in the present crisis the important question was not the degree of difficulty in obtaining the Irishrecruits so much as whether they would fight. In this connection,and with reference to War Cabinet 374, Minutes 6 and 12, the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff reported that he had made enquiries,and there was no evidence that the 16th Division had not fought-well; its losses had not been so great as had at first been supposed.Lord Derby pointed out, however, that a third of this division was now composed of English drafts. General Mahon and GeneralByrne, who were invited to express their viewrs, both consideredthat the moral, situation would be slightly eased by applying the suggested Ballot; that the difficulties would nevertheless be very great,but that eventually the men would be obtained. General Byrneanticipated that the efficient Sinn Fein organisation would probably
be utilised to develop conscientious objection and passive resistanceon a large scale. Pie considered that we should do well if half therecruits taken became efficient soldiers, but General Mahon thoughtthat the proportion wordd be as high as SO per cent. Lord&quot;Frenchsuggested that, by training the men in a theatre of war whereextreme penalties could be inflicted for serious breaches of discipline,these men could be made into soldiers. General Byrne agreed withthe Field-Marshal that the men should be removed from Ireland assoon as recruited, and should be trained in France. General Mahonsaid that, in order to cany out conscription, it would be necessary,as a temporary measure, to increase the garrison of Ireland, nownumbering 29,000 men, by perhaps two brigades, although lord french thought this was an over-estimate if the Cyclist Divisionwere utilised.Before they withdrew the Prime Minister impressed strongly on general Mahon and General Byrne the importance of avoidingarousing suspicion in Ireland that the question of extending con-scription to Ireland was under discussion.The Prime Minister pointed out that it wovdd be impossible tocarry Home Rule.in this country unless compulsory military service,or its equivalent, were applied to Ireland.Mr. Balfour suggested that, while it would not do to give theaspect of a bargain to the transaction, the effect of a bargain couldbe obtained by bringing in the Convention BiR and the MilitaryService Bill simultaneously. On the other hand, there was thedanger that the Convention might raise its terms.3. The War Cabinet had a short discussion on the preliminary draft Bill for the amendment of the Military Service Act circulatedby the Minister of National Service (Paper G.T.-4036).Sir Auckland Gfeddes explained the main provisions of the Bill,and indicated that it was entirely military in character, and did notdeal with industrial service, although, of course, the men called rxpmight be used on aerodromes, heavy digging, and so forth.Dr. Adclison thought it to be a serious mistake to abolish theexisting Tribunals and to leave the decisions on recruiting to the discretion of the Minister of National Service. Such a proposalaltered the whole machinery of recruiting, would be opposed inthe House of Commons, and, unless the new arrangement was certain to secure more men, he should advise dropping it from theBiU.Sir Auckland Geddes explaiued that the proposal now was toobtain every possible man for the Army, but the Government would hold back only the men absolutely essential for civil occupations.Mr. Barnes thought it would, be preferable to have two Billsinvolving different degrees of combing-out. He was doubtful aboutthe inclusion of Ireland ; he thought the age might safely be raised to 50, and exemptions wiped out; but if the age was to be loweredto 17, then pledges should be given that the boys should not besent overseas for military duty.In this connection it was suggested that the boys might be registered and given a certain amount of military training, as was done with the CO&quot; Class of Volunteers.Sir Auckland geddes was requested to put his Bill into thehands of the parliamentary draughtsman, for immediatecirculation to the War Cabinet.
4. With reference to War Cabinet 372, Minute 14, theChancellor of the Exchequer called the attention of the WarCabinet to certain legal difficulties in connection with the immediatesummoning of Parliament. Pie thought, however, these could begot over by a subsequent Act of Indemnity.Mr. Duke said he thought the Report of the Convention wouldbe in the hands of the Cabinet on Saturday, the 6th April.It was generally agreed that it would be easier to proceed withman-power legislation in Parliament if the military situation had had time to clear up definitely, for better or for worse.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff thought that within aweek such a definite decision would have been reached, and in thisview Lord French concurred.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March 28, 1918.
