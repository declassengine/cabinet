Acquisition of 1. With reference to War  Cabinet  359, Minute 10, LordDutch Tonnage. Robert Cecil once more raised the question of the acquisition of dutch shipping. He reminded the War Cabinet that the question had been delegated to Lord Milner, General Smuts, Sir JosephMaclay, and himself, who had rea,ched the following decision,recorded in Paper G.T.-3818, which had been circulated: &quot; The Dutch Government should be given one finalchance of ratifying the agreement. In the event, however&apos;, oftheir failing to do so by Monday, the 11th March, the dateof the first Meeting of the Allied Maritime transport council, we should encourage our American, French, andItalian colleagues on that Council to agree to the requisition-ing of the ships.&quot;Sir J&quot;oseph Maclay had since come to him and had urged thatthe decision ought to be reconsidered.Sir Joseph Maclay said that the gravity of the situation hadbeen brought home to him more than ever by the recent corre-spondence between the Prime Minister and the French Presidentof the Council in regard to the coal position in France and Italy,which emphasised the vital need for additional tonnage for these purposes. The acquisition of 400,000 tons of Dutch shipping inthe United States of America, and 200,000 tons elsewhere,would make all the difference to France and Italy, and to thewhole shipping situation. Perhaps it might prove the mostimportant factor in the war. If we gave Holland further time toconsider the matter she would probably consult Germany, and means might be found for further delay and obstruction.Lord Robert Cecil explained that he had seen Herr VanVollenhoven, and had warned him that we would wait no longer.Lord Robert Cecil then gave an outline of a new agreement he proposed should be put before the Dutch Government, the new agreement replacing the old one. This agreement provided, inter alia, that we should requisition the Dutch tonnage above referredto; that we should be entitled to employ it in the war zone; andthat we should guarantee that the Allies would replace, after thewar, any ships sunk in the war zone by enemy action. If not accepted by Monday, the 18th March, 1918, we should be obligedto reouisition the Dutch shipping.The War Cabinet decided that-.(a.) The Dutch Minister in London should be notifiedregarding the proposed fresh agreement.(b.) The new agreement should be considered by the allied maritime Transport Council, so far as concerned the incidence of liability for replacement among the/ different Allies.Supplies to Greece 2. The War Cabinet had before them a telegram from M.Venizelos to the Prime Minister, dated the 27th February, 1918(Paper G.T.-3816L in which he requested that 1,200 tons of seedshould be brought from Alexandria to Greece, in order that itmight be sown and give a crop of 60,000 tons of fodder in Junonext. The telegram stated that the Egyptian Government had soPar refused to export the seed asked for.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should place h hoself in communication with the Egyptian Government,in order to ascertain the position, and should issue to- them   instructions   that  the seed requested  by  M.y Venizelos should be forwarded, if available.
3 WG 3613. The War Cabinet also had before them a further telegramfrom M. Venizeios (Paper G.T.-3816), in which he complained that the tonnage placed at the disposal of Greece was inadequate for their needs, and made a request that further tonnage shouldbe placed at the disposal of the Greek Government to replace shipslost by enemy action. M. Venizeios also complained that their demands for food bad been unsatisfied.Sir Joseph Maclay stated that the cereals deliveries were only about 9 per cent, behind arrangements made with Greece.He hoped that by May all the deficit would be wiped off. he undertook to inform the Wheat Commission relative to theCa_bi.net memorandum.It was pointed out that in respect to replacing the lostshipping, the Allies were under rather a special obligation to greece, since, earlier in the war, they had obtained control of practically the whole of the Greek mercantile marine.The War Cabinet decided that The   question   of replacing the lost  Greek  ships  shouldy meantime be dealt with by the Shipping Controller.The Western Front. 4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that the belgians claimed a great success at Ramscapelle, where they hady   captured 100 prisoners.5. With reference to War Cabinet 358, Minute 1, the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff reported that, with regard to the attack by the Germans on the Portuguese front, a Portuguesedivision had been called up from reserve and had reoccupied the^   lost trenches.Transfer of German 6- With reference to War Cabinet 360, Minute 2, the ChiefDivisions.     yb,    of the Imperial General Staff stated that the total of German, &quot;3 /&apos;     divisions now on the Western front  was 184.   There were no* y -2/-    further   signs  of   a  German attack other than those alreadyreported.Pay and Separation , With reference to War Cabinet 322, Minute 2, the ChiefAllowances of of the Imperial General Staff raised the question of the paymentItalian Soldiers       of the Italian soldiers&apos; separation allowance out of British funds.Lord Jyfitner explained the difficulty of raising the question/py     with the Italian Government.1 tS^t/ / General Smuts said he had discussed the matter with Baroni    (/ Sonnino, who had explained that the Italian Government wished&quot;5 y&apos;. to do something, but that their ability to do so depended to someextent upon the results of the Italian War Loan./ While it  was recognised that any direct payment to the*   &apos; Italians for this purpose could hardly be made without offendingItalian susceptibilities, it was suggested that the difficulty might possibly be surmounted by means of a British subscription to theItalian War Loan.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should takeadvantage of the presence of the Italian Ministers inthis country the following week to discuss the question,if a favourable opportunity presented itself.a--
Anglo-Russian 8. With reference to War Cabinet 84.5, Minute 3, and PaperMilitary Service G.T.-382S, Lord Derby stated that a rule for a writ of habeasAgreement. corpus was obtained on the 5th instant at the suit of a Russiannamed Kutchinsky against the Officer  Commanding the 39thX^.&quot;37a       Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, at Plymouth, and that this would alsoV-) -        if-      be served on the Secretary of State for War.   Lord Derby statedthat he had been informed by word of mouth from the treasury solicitor that if this matter was brought before a Court, the manwould probably secure a release.   Lord Derby also stated thatthere were about 1,600 Russians now at Plymouth, and he expectedthese men would create some difficulties with regard to serving inthe British Army, on account of the fact that our agreements withRussia were no longer valid, as, in accordance with the agreement under which these men signed on, they were now liberated.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for War should fight the case of the^ Russian Kutchinsky in the Courts.Russia : RussianCruisers atHelsinefors.9. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that Stockholm reportedthrough the Berlin wireless, that four Russian cruisers had arrivedat Helsingfors from Reval.It was also stated that, for the protection of Helsingfors andthe Labourers&quot; Council, the Marine Department at Helsingfors&apos;had decided upon the formation of a Red Fleet which was to con-tinue to fight without regard to the German-Russian peace.li))Submarines. 10. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that one of our sea-planes, had attacked an enemy submarine 35 miles N.W. of CapeAntifer, on  the  6th instant.   The seaplane had dropped two&apos; bombs, but it wras not known whether she had succeeded in sink-ing the submarine.Publication of report of LabourDelegation toRussia in 1917.Bombing of OpenTowns.S Cf11. The War Cabinet had under consideration the questionof publishing the report on the visit of the Labour Delegation toRussia during April and May 1917, by Mr. J. 0&apos;Grady, M.P.,Mr. W. Thorne, M.P., and &apos; Captain W. S. Saunders (paper g.-150). &apos;The War Cabinet decided that A summary of this report, prepared under the supervision of Mr. Barnes, should be published.12. With reference to War Cabinet 358, Minute 9, it waspointed out that Mr. Bonar Law might be called upon, in theHouse of Commons, to make a statement on behalf of the Govern-inent, regarding a speech in the Bavarian Chamber which appeared to signify an offer on behalf of Germany to abandonair raids on open towns if we agreed to do the same (TelegramNo. 932 from The Hague).The opinion was expressed that the offer could only have as its motive the consideration that we were able to do the Germansmore damage than they could do us. Even in the last three months,with as yet undeveloped means, we had done more harm to them than they to us. It was also indicated that, if, for example, itwere agreed on both&apos; sides to confine bombing to an area within20 or 30 kilometres of the front line, the effect on the western front would be that both sides would concentrate all the damagethey could inflict on French and Belgian towns. It was generally agreed that to abandon the bombing of distant objectives couldonly now profit the enemy; that we could not agree to abandonsuch operations without consulting our Allies; and that, in the
interest of the world&apos;s peace in the future, it was not desirablethat the civil population of Germany should be the one populationamong the belligerent nations immune from the worst sufferingsof war.It was concluded that Mr. Bonar Law should make no state-ment unless questioned on the subject, but that, if questioned, heshould base his reply on the following propositions: (a.) That wo had not bombed open towns except in veryrare cases, as direct reprisals.(6.) That we are most desirous of diminishing the sufferingsof non-combatants, especially women and children,(c.) That we cannot give up the right to  bomb genuinemilitary objectives.13. The War Cabinet had before them a Report on the out-put of machines with a view to increased offensive against german towns (Paper G.T.-3436).General Trenchard explained that since January little had occurred to modify the conclusions and forecasts contained in thereport. There might be a slight diminution in the output ofHandley-Page machines from August onwards, in favour of expediting the output of the flying-boat programme. If the&quot;Liberty &quot;&apos; engine were ready in time, however, this diminutionmight be avoided.14. With regard to the &quot; Liberty &quot; engine, General Trenchardsaid that three Liberty engines were being tested in France. the test was so far satisfactory, but it could not be said that this type of engine had yet passed the inevitable &quot;teething troubles,&quot;for which adequate allowance in time had been made in our- programme.15. (Questioned as to the supply of aircraft for anti-submarinework, Admiral Flope stated that the Admiralty and the AirBoard had reached a satisfactory arrangement. The use of aero-planes for this purpose near the coast was being extended. Thiswas being done from Dunkirk and Otranto, but there were many parts of the coasts where it was difficult to find sites for aero-dromes; hence the need of long-distance flying-boats, and the con-tinued necessity of patrol craft.Mr. Churchill pointed out, in this connection, that 60 percent, of - the shipping sunk of late by submarines, was sunkwithin 10 miles of the shore; that in no case had a ship escorted by aeroplanes been sunk; that a pilot ran less risk over the sea in close proximity to a friendly ship than over enemy territory;and that an increasing surplus of aeroplanes could be expected.Lord Rothermere stated that, while seaplanes can fly on anaverage one day in seven, aeroplanes can defy the weather on five.The value of aeroplanes for this service was, therefore, great, andit was understood that the De Haviland 9, when, fitted with twinengines, would be very effective.The War Cabinet took note with satisfaction of the develop-ment of aircraft for anti-submarine work.16. The Minister of Munitions gave figures of the compara-tive production of aeroplanes in the last four years: 1914 ... ... ... 2111915 ... ... ... 2,0931916 ... ... ... 6,0991917 ... ... ... 14,168ill
He also gave estimates for the coming months: &apos; March ... ... ... 2,289April ... ... ... 2,747May ... ... ... 2,928June ... ... ... 3,165The production of engines followed about the same ascendingscale. After June there would be a slowing down in the processas new types would be undertaken, which had not been decided on sufficiently in advance.. These remarkable figures were due tothe energy and ability of Sir William Weir.The War Cabinet expressed its satisfaction at the results achieved, and congratulated Sir William Weir on the successi/   which had attended his effortsSupply of personnel for proposed increase in AirForce.y17. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byLord Rothermere (Paper G.T.-3727) on the proposed increase inthe Air Force Programme.Mr. Churchill expressed the view that production would soonoutstrip the man-power requisite for utilising its results. By the1st July, according to present estimates, 10,000 additional fighting-machines would be delivered. A big indent had been made for machine guns, and it would be carried out. In the next sixmonths 27,000 more aircraft machine guns might be expected, butthey would not be needed as fast as they were made. Wastagein aeroplanes, moreover, had proved to be only 75 per cent., and inengines only 50 per cent, of the estimate. It followed that-by theend of June there would be a large stock of material ready withoutthe man-power to handle it.General Trenchard agreed that there would be a surplus of machine-guns, but did not agree that there would be a surplusof aeroplanes, in view of the greater enterprises that would beundertaken, and of the need of keeping a reserve. It was neverpossible to foresee which type of machine would fare best; there might at times prove to be a surplus of some types, but, as awhole, there would be no excess. He agreed, however, that if theman-power asked for in the Memorandum by Lord Rothermere(Paper G.T.-3727) were not forthcoming, much of the material would perforce remain idle.The War Cabinet approved the proposed increase of the AirForce Programme by 40 squadrons, jus set forth in the Memoran-dura, and decided that The Secretary of State for the Air Force should arrange fora Conference, on the subject of his needs in personnel,with the Secretary of State for War and the Minister ofNational Service, and that the result should be reportedto the War Cabinet.Pilots. 18. Questioned as to the adequacy of the supply of pilots,General Trenchard said that the season was adverse to training,and that the situation at this time was always an anxious one.He had hopes, however, that if the man-power requirements weresolved, there would be a sufficient number- of pilots. There were14,000 under training, and there would be some 3,000 at the front.Lord Rothermere pointed out that training-aerodromes hadnot been made ready as fast as had been hoped.   In Egypt therewere 8 training squadrons, which, would be increased to 20; andJ    in Canada 6, which likewise would be raised to 20.
7WC 361147American Output.The &quot; A.B.C.&quot;Engine.o19. With reference to War Cabinet 323, Minute 5, it was stated that reports of progress in America were conflicting, andthat it was not easy to form a correct estimate. On the dataavailable it seemed likely that the Americans would not have morethan 24 squadrons for service in France before the end of the year,and another 84 in 1919.Sir William Weir pointed out that the American problem was governed by the shipping factor. The Americans could notship complete aeroplanes, because of the space they require, andhad no developed arrangements for assembling parts andorganising sqadrons on tins side of the Atlantic. Their outputof parts was ample, but their organisation for erecting and building was not concurrent. It was very necessary that theyshould face this problem.It was decided by the War Cabinet that The Secretary of State for the Air Force should draft a tele-gram, for transmission by the Foreign Office, to lord reading, requesting him to draw the attention of thePresident of the United States of America to the serious situation of the American aerial output.20. Mention was made of a new British machine known asthe &apos;A.B.C,&quot; which Sir William Weir said was the first machinewhich it might be advisable to standardise. He gave certainparticulars of the merits of this new engine.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March 7. 1918.o
