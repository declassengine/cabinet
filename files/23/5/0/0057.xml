Supreme WarCouncil: PoliticalConference.1. With reference to War Cabinet 364, Minute 9, in view of representations put forward by the Secretary of State of ForeignAffairs, the War Cabinet decided that It was desirable, with a view to keeping the political dis-cussions separate from those appertaining to militaryaffairs, that the meeting of the Supreme War Councily with regard to the former should be held on Friday next.The western front: possible german Attack.2. With reference to War Cabinet 364; Minute 1, theDirector of Military Operations reported that the only newindication of an impending attack on the British front was theappearance of the Brandenburg Corps, in reserve, south ofLille. This corps consisted of two divisions, the 5th and 6th. he also pointed out that this made no difference in the total numberof enemy divisions, which remained at 186, of which 79 were in reserve. This gave an approximate total of enemy rifle strengthof 1,370,000 men and 15,700 guns, while the total Allied riflestrength on the Western front numbered 1,500,000 infantry and16,600 guns. The relative strength of a British division was slightly larger than that of a German division.The Balkan Front./3.3. With reference to telegram No. 359, of the 12th March,1918, from the British Minister at Berne, relative to a change inthe movements of the ecc-King of Greece, possibly in consequenceof a telegram received from the German Emperor, it wassuggested to the War Cabinet that the German concentration inthe West might be intended to conceal the intention of a suddenand rapid attack on the Balkan front.The Director of Military Operations pointed out that, onthe last occasion when he had been asked his view on this question,he had expressed the opinion that an attack on the Balkan frontwas by no means improbable. There were no signs at present ofany preparations for such an attack, but it was always difficultto obtain news of any strategic movements, and local informationonly was possible.The Secretary of State for Foreign. Affairs said that, so faras Foreign Office information&apos; went to fight for what they did not desire to keep.The Director of Military Operations stated that information received from a number of Bulgarians, who had been captured,confirmed this view. The General Staff had constantly pressed forGeneral Guillaumafs plans, but they had not yet received them.According to the latest information, an orricer was on his way from Salonica with the plans. It was pointed out by the Directorof Military Operations chat, in the event of the Allied forceshaving to fall&quot;back on Salonica, it might be possible, if the enemyadvanced via Monastir and. occupied the south-west corner of theGulf of Salonica, for them to deny the use of the port to our shipping, &amp;c.The War Cabinet decided that The question should be raised at the meeting of the supreme war Council, with a view to its consideration by thePermanent Military Representatives.the Bulgarians were reluctantPalestine4. The Director of Military Operations reported that information had been received from General Allenby that theenemy had a force of 3,500 rifles and 25 guns south of the DeadSea, and that they were operating there with a view to assisting the withdrawal of their forces on the Hedjaz Railway.   There
Air Raid. 5. The Director of Military Operations reported that fiveZeppelins passed over Yorkshire, crossing the coast atFlamboxough Head, on the previous night. Very little damage was reported. The weather was thick and misty, and observationwas difficult. The Director of Military Operations also reportedthat a. squadron of giant aeroplanes crossed to the coast at Dover,y&apos; but turned back, apparently owing to the state of the weather.Air Raid on Paris. 6. The Director of Military Operations reported that, in theair raid which took place on the night of the 11th instant, threebombs were dropped on the French War Office, the enemy aero-planes coming down to a height of 400 feet over the building.The losses in Paris were very heavy, due mainly to a panic in atube station. It was stated that the air defences of Paris werey &apos; inadequate.Bombing Raid. 7  The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff reported that in a heavy bombing raid carried out from Dunkirk on the night ofthe 11th/12th March-, 54 bombs were dropped on Bruges Dock.The visibility was bad, preventing any observation of results.Attention was drawn to the large expenditure of bombs onthis area, and the Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff explained thatthis constant bombing of Bruges Dock considerably hampered thev&quot;   work in pi ogress, and impeded movements.Seaplane 8. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff also reported that,Engagement. when two &quot;America &quot; flying boats were on patrol, they found fiveGerman seaplanes lying on the water directly on the course takenby the Dutch convoy between Harwich and Rotterdam. TheBritish seaplanes attacked, and the engagement lasted half an hour. One enemy plane crashed, the observer in another waskilled, and a third descended on to the water, but escaped. Ourboats fought until all their ammunition was expended, and they&apos; only casualty on our side was one wireless rating wounded.Resignation ofM. Trotzki.japanese intervention,0. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff reported the receiptof a telegram from the Naval Attache at Petrograd, which statedthat the resignation of M. Trotzki was not taken seriously, as hewill be asked to continue in office. It was also stated in the tele-gram that any action taken by the Japanese might drive theRussians into the arms of Germany. The Naval Attache wasrepeatedly being questioned as to how far we were working inaccordance with the Japanese, and requested information.Russian Warships. 10. The Deputy Chief  of  the  Naval Staff  reported theq       arrangements the Admiralty had   in view  for  depriving  the^L^^y   y Germans of any effective use of Russian warships.f 1365-3651 B 2were ly500 rifles and 100 guns between Amman and Medina.All the operations contemplated in this theatre of war had sofar been completed by the dates forecasted in General Allenby&apos;sy &apos; programme.
Spitsbergen. 11. Attention was drawn to telegram No. 1412, of the 12thMarch, 1918, to Lord Reading, in which reference was made to thepossibility of German action in Spitzbergen.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed out thata new situation had arisen in Spitzbergen, which had alreadybeen under his consideration, and that he was in communicationwith the Admiralty on the subject. He pointed out that germany was making advances as regards securing a locus standi in Spitzbergen, and that, if this situation were to stand after the war,our line of communication to Siberia would be threatened. Inview of the large deposits of coal in Spitzbergen, and thepossible barring of the route to Siberia, it was evident that a veryserious situation would arise if Germany got a special hold uponSpitzbergen.The Secretary mentioned that he had received frequent com-munications from Colonel Yate. M.P., relative to the importanceof Spitzbergen, and the possible use by the enemy of a wireless telegraphy station that had been erected there by the Germansprior to the outbreak of war.The War Cabinet decided that The Foreign Office should confer with the Admiralty on theu &apos; subject, and report to the War Cabinet.12. The War Cabinet had before them the Report of theEgyptian Administration Committee (Paper G.-162), which thevEgypt. approved.Civil Disturbance. 1.3. The War Cabinet had under consideration the Report(Paper G.T.- 3814) of a Committee appointed by War Cabinet339, Minute 4 (&amp;) to consider the steps to be taken in the eventof serious industrial trouble arising in connection with theattitude of the engineers towards the Governments man-powermeasures, and authorised The Secretary of State for Home Affairs to take action onthe lines recommended in the Report of the Committee,i--^ in conjunction with the Departments concerned.The future government ofVenereal Diseases. 14. With reference to War Cabinet 352, Minute 10, the WarCabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Home Affairs (Paper G.T.-3812), and a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (Paper G.T.-3824).Mr. Long reminded the Cabinet that the Government hadbeen urged in the strongest possible terms, at the Imperial war conference, 1917, to take immediate steps to remedy what wasadmittedly a public scandal. The Dominion Governments wereprofoundly dissatisfied with the inaction of His Majesty&apos;s- Government. Messages were constantly arriving from theDominions calling his (Mr. Long&apos;s) attention to the matter. Thewhole subject had been discussed by a Departmental Conference,and a Regulation had been unanimously adopted, andsubsequently approved by the War Cabinet. Any further delay would cause very grave trouble with the Dominions. In his view.the procedure must be a civil procedure, through the police.Sir George Cave said that the Regulation, if made, would beopen to criticism on the ground (1) that its penalties applied to women and not to men, and (2) that it protected soldiers and sailors and excluded civilians. He wished to raise two questions:Who would defend the Regulation in Parliament? and Who wouldenforce the Regulation? He contended that he could not properlyrepresent soldiers and sailors in the House, and that theprosecuting authority at the back of the police must be the
military and naval authorities.. The situation would be eased ifthere were some means of punishing the men as well as thewomen concerned.Brigadier-General Childs said that the soldier could bedealt with indirectly. It was an offence, on the part of a soldier,to conceal the fact that he was suffering from venereal disease.If suffering from such disease he should be in hospital. If a woman alleged that she had been infected by a soldier, he couldbe medically examined, and, if found to be suffering fromvenereal disease would be punished by the Army Authorities forconcealment. For this offence he is liable to two years&apos; iinprison-ment with hard labour.Lord Derby said that to make a soldier punishable for com-communicating the disease would require an alteration in the army act. He did not see why soldiers and sailors should be thusselected and put in a worse position than civilians.Sir George Cave was of the opinion that it would not bepossible to deal with communication of disease to civilians underthe Defence of the Realm Act. If the War Office would defend the Regulation in Parliament, and take the initial action inprosecutions, he was prepared to lender all possible support atthe Home Office.The War Cabinet re-affirmed their approval of the Regula-tion, and decided that (a.) Steps should be taken, so far as possible, to make the punishment of the soldier reciprocal with that falling on the woman offender; and also of the sailor if theNaval Discipline Act corresponded with the Army Act.(5.) The Representative of the War Office, supported by Mr.Long and Sir George Cave, should defend the Regula-tion in Parliament, if it were challenged.(c.) The initial action in a prosecution should lie with thearmy and navy authorities, and the prosecution itself be conducted by the Police.Tank Programme. 15. The War Cabinet had under consideration the questionof the allocation of steel for the extended British tank programme as compared with the Anglo-American tank programme (Con-elusion (c) of the Minutes of a Meeting held on the 8th March.1918).Mr. Churchill drew attention to War Cabinet 318, Minute 13,and the Appendix thereto, in which the agreement between theBritish and American Governments is set out as regards thebuilding of American tanks, and under which the latter undertaketo give priority as regards material, shipping, &amp;o, and to replace the armour plates for the United States tanks in the form of ship-plates, on or about the date of delivery of the armour plate to thefactory, on the basis of ton for ton. Mr, Churchill added that, ifthe United States failed to be punctual as regards deliveries inthis matter, the armour plate that had been provided for theirtanks would be diverted for the construction of the British tanksunder our extended programme, but that he hoped to be able tomeet all three programmes at a greater rate than trained personnelcould be made available for manning the tanks.On the above conditions as to supply, Lord Derby agreed tothe cancellation of Conclusion (c) of the Minutes.y       The War Cabinet approved.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March 13, 1918.
