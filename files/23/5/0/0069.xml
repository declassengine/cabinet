German Attack.The PresentPosition.1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported thatseventy-nine German divisions had been identified, exclusive ofthose identified on the French front during the last two days. Thetotal number of German divisions would be about eighty-five if weallowed the French six or seven divisions which they had not so farreported to us. On this basis, the Germans had about twelve fresh divisions left. One of the most hopeful signs, in the opinion of theChief of the Imperial General Staff, was the immense rate at which german divisions are passing through the battle. It was veryextravagant in time and transport for them to withdraw a divisionbefore it was essential.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that the attack in front of Arras appeared to have done us no great damage, and tohave been repulsed with greatly inferior numbers. Further south,a slight advantage had been secured by the enemy, and they had &apos;gained the Morlancourt position. Immediately south of the Somme,nothing but the remnants of the Vth Army were available. In thisconnection, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that muchdepended on whether the French counter-offensive west of Noyonwas able to make satisfactory progress. It was unlikely that theGermans had so far been able to bring up guns heavy enough toshell Amiens.At a later stage the Director of Military Operations informed the War Cabinet that there had been no further attacks on ourfront. He further stated that the attack on Arras had been broughtto a standstill. It was expected that the Germans would attacksouth of the Somme to-day, but that no attack had been made up tothe present. As regards the front held by the French, he consideredthat the line south of the Oise was now safe.. Between the Sommeand the Oise there were now fifteen French divisions, of whichseven were new divisions ready for immediate use, while it was expected two more infantry divisions and two more cavalry divisions would arrive to-day. He reported that between the Somme and theOise the Germans had twenty-three divisions, of which only fivewere fresh ones.Reinforcements:Cyclists Divisions.2. The Secretary of State for War stated that he considered itinadvisable to despatch the cyclists divisions to France, as lord french had informed him that this was the only available reinforce-ment for use in Ireland if necessity arose.The War Cabinet decided that The cyclists divisions should not be sent to France at present.General Rawlinsonto commandVth Army.General Sackville-West to be -y^sri.Permanent      &apos; 3MilitaryRepresentative at versailles.rTaval Losses.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that GeneralItawlinson had left Versailles to command the Vth Army, and theWar Cabinet approved the proposal of the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff that General Sackvilie- West should be appointed as Acting BritishPermanent Military Representative at Versailles.4. The. First Sea Lord reported that. H.M.S. &quot; Tithonus &quot; hadbeen sunk by a submarine, on the 28th instant, 51 miles fromGirdleness ; 140* survivors had been picked up by a torpedo-hoo-i^destroyer.     .....Royal Marinesfrom the Navy.5. With reference to War Cabinet 372, Minute 9, the First sea lord said that the Second Sea Lord had done his utmost to find men for the Army, and had succeeded in releasing between 400 and 500trained gunners.   In addition, some young Marines were being
released for coast defence, to relieve skilled gunners. Sir RosslynWemyss said it was impossible for the Admiralty to countenance the3*7&apos;^.-- withdrawal of Royal Marines from the Grand Fleet, as this woulddisorganise the lighting efficiency of the Fleet. He explained the3. interdependence of the different parts of organisation of a ship,showing that the a withdrawal of one group of trained fighting men would disorganise the ship. The increase of 25 per cent, made tothe personnel of the Fleet in the early stages of the war applied only tostokers and young seamen. He stated that our ships are less heavilymanned than the Germans by about 15 per cent.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff urged that, just as theArmy were compelled to thin their line and take risks in order to release men for the decisive point, so the Navy ought to be preparedto reduce their margin of safety.The War Cabinet decided that They would not take the responsibility of overruling theAdmiralty on a point involving technical and professionalconsiderations, upon which the Admiralty were the solejudges.Relief by the C. A suggestion was made that the United. States Fleet mightUnited States furnish units, beyond the forces already operating in British waters,Navy, to enable some of the older units of our Fleet to be demobilised, witha view to the employment of their personnel in some manner to relieve the present emergency.The First Sea Lord stated that there were none of the olderclasses of ships in commission in home waters- There were fiveUnited States battleships at present in the North Sea Fleet, but hehad been in personal communication with the Connnander-in-C&apos;chief;Grand Fleet, and, having regard to its limited experience in thepresent war, he could not advise that the United States Xavy was at^      present, in a state of efficiency to replace fighting units.IITransport of &apos;&apos;. With reference to War Cabinet 370, Minute 8, the WarAmerican Troops.     Cabinet had under coiisideration the question of the possibility oftransporting a large contingent of American   troops across the atlantic.   It was stated  that  it was   necessary,  if  possible, to3^ transport at least 100,000 a month.The Secretary of State for War reported that he had received aletter from Sir Sam Fay, who informed him that the only informationprocurable as to expected sailings was as follows : the &quot;Megantic,&quot;yy with 1,772 troops ; the &quot; Cretic,&quot; with 1,381 troops ; the &quot;Lapland,&quot;y1&apos; with 2,247 troops; the &quot; Carmania,&quot; with 2,700 troops; making atotal of 8,000 for the next week. Sir Sam Fay said that he considered that this was more than disappointing ; that he couldonly suppose that ships were being held up in New York to load upcargo, and that he was taking the matter up strongly with theShipping Controller.Mr. Graeme Thomson expressed the opinion that, with theassistance of American, Dutch, and British tonnage, we could,during the month of April, transport 120,000 American troopsacross the Atlantic, and thereafter a small monthly increase on that number.It Avas pointed out that, even if guns and equipment were not. brought across, this would make no difference to the total numberof infantry&apos; which could be transported, as such stores were carriedentirely in a different class of vessel.The Prime Minister laid great stress on the urgency of this problem, and the importance of bringing all possible pressure tobear on President Wilson immediately. He was of opinion that president Wilson should be told that it was essential that theseAmerican troops should be forthcoming within the next few months.
During tlie next three or four months the Americans should suspendbuilding up their own army in France, and make the large majorityof their men arriving in France available for attachment to british or French brigades. It was true that at Versailles the difficulty ofthe Americans lighting under a foreign flag had been emphasised,but in the present crisis, and taking into consideration the presenttemper of the American public, he-thought this difficulty would beswept aside.The War Cabinet decided that -(a.) The Prime Minister and the Secretary&apos;of State for ForeignAffairs should send a telegram to President Wilson tothe effect that, pending the results of the British man-power proposals, there would, for the next few months,be a very serious gap with regard to the number of men available for drafts to the Allied forces, and that it was most essential that American infantry should be trans-ported to France at the rate of not less than 100,000 per month for the next three months for incorporation bybattalions in the British or French armies ;(6.) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should prepare adraft of the telegram on the lines indicated above ;(c.) Mr. Graeme Thomson should prepare a Memorandumstating the amount of shipping available and the numberof infantry which could be transported across the Atlanticduring the course of the next three months, and that theinformation in this Memorandum should be communi-cated to President Wilson.Man-Power:Proposed lowering of Age Limit.8. Attention was called to the draft Minute 7 of WarCabinet .376, circulated by the Secretary, in which it was recordedthat the War Cabinet had decided that the feeling of this country was such that to lower the age of recruiting to 17 was impracticable.It was agreed that, while there had been a general consensus ofopinion in this sense, no actual decision had been taken, and The Secretary was instructed to amend the draft accordingly.Field-Marshal Lord French pointed out that if youths of 17could be incorporated with Class &quot; G &quot; of the Volunteers theywould receive a certain number of hours&apos; training a week.The Minister of National Service said that in bis draft Bill hesuggested that boys of 17 should do some training, but that unless it was made compulsory he thought it was improbable that theseyouths would attend drills voluntarily.The War Cabinet decided To adopt Lord Frenches proposal, and make it compulsory foryouths of 17 to be enrolled in Class &quot; C &apos;&apos; of the volunteers and to attend the number of drills laid down for this class.Ireland:Letter fromGeneral Mahon toLord French.9. Field-Marshal Lord French read out to the War Cabinet aletter that he had received that morning from General Mahon. Theletter referred to the remark made by the Prime Minister aboutsecrecy (War Cabinet 375, Minute 2), and stated that GeneralMahon had discovered, on arrival in Dublin, that the subject of conscription was common talk, and that, it was the general impression that it was going to be enforced. General Mahon had made a few enquiries as to how it would be received, and he gathered that the opposition would be less than he had statedbefore the Cabinet (War .Cabinet 370, Minute 2). The suddenadvance of the Germans in France, the letter continued, hadevidently made an impression which had swung anti-conscription
201Views of labour members of theGovernment.Man-PowerProposals..,3y-Ay10. The Prime Minister stated that he had yesterday inter-viewed some of his Labour colleagues, and had heard from themtheir views on the enforcement of the Military Service Act onIreland. Though at first opposed to the idea, their general feelingafter the conversation was that, if the application of the MilitaryService Act to Ireland was accompanied by a pledge to cany home rule, the situation wordd be made easier. One of his Labourcolleagues had expressed the opinion that he would not feel justifiedin advocating on the platform the raising of the military age inGreat Britain to 50 unless some form of compulsion was applied toIreland.11. With reference to War Cabinet 376, Minute 6, the WarCabinet had before them the following documents : Draft Bill (Paper G.T.-4057),Memorandum, by Mr. Duke (Paper G.T.-4052),Memorandum by Mr. Munro (Paper G.T.-4055),Memorandum by Mr. Hayes Fisher (Paper G.T.-4058),Memorandum by Sir Albert Stanley (Paper G.T.-4059).The Prime Minister stated that, in view of the diversity of opinions indicated in the Papers circulated by the various Depart-ments, more particularly with regard to the proposed substitution of Military Service Advisory Committees for the existing Tribunals,he considered it advisable that all the clauses of the Bill should beconsidered by a small Committee, on which Committee Lord Milnermight be recjuested to represent the War Cabinet.The War Cabuiet decided To appoint the following Committee to consider the draft ofthe Military Service Bill (Paper G.T.-4057) :-Sir George Cave (Chairman),Lord Milner,Sir Auckland Geddes,Mr. Duke,Mr. Munro,Mr. Hayes Pisker,Mr. Roberts,Mr. T. Jones (Secretary),and that the Committee should have power to summon anyrepresentatives of Departments concerned.opinion round considerably, on account of sympathy with theFrench. He had stated at the meeting that the Nationalist party and the clergy would resist compulsory service, but he now gathered that many of the former would only be passive in their resistance,and that some of the clergy might accept it under protest whenthey knew it was inevitable, and was to be carried out resolutely.If at the same time compulsory service was passed Home Rule for ireland was also declared, it would make matters easier. GeneralMahon believed that the only actual opposition would come fromthe Sinn Feiners, and that if Cardinal Logue and the hierarchyof the Roman Catholic Church denounced futile resistance, whichmight lead to bloodshed, opposition would be diminished. Hesuggested that when once conscription had been decided on CardinalLogue should be informed, and said he was willing to convey the information himself, if thought desirable. The letter concluded with the opinion that the longer the delay in enforcing conscriptionin Ireland, the greater wrould be the difficuties.The War Cabinet decided that At the present moment it would be inadvisable to make any communication to Cardinal Logue, and that Field-Marshal Lord French should instruct General &quot;Mahon totake no action.
British Mission 12. With reference to War Cabinet 366, Minute 10, with regardto Japan. to the Military Mission to present a baton to the Mikado of Japan,0^ the War Cabinet decided that--J.   /1^&apos; The composition of the Mission should be left in the hands ofr the Secretary of State for War, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, and Lord Beaverbrook.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March 29, 1918.
