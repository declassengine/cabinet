Chinese Troops for 1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that thethe Western Front,   question of employing Chinese troops on the Western front had been raised by the Americans, who proposed to refer the question to thePermanent Military Representatives at Versailles.,-. Attention was drawn to the previous War Cabinet decision on0 this   subject (War Cabinet   273, Minute   17),  to the   following effect: &quot;The Chief of the Imperial General Staff&apos; should reply toGeneral Foch that His Majesty&apos;s Government would support theproposal to employ Chinese pioneer battalions up to the numberof forty battalions on the Western front, provided that theFrench Government employed either French, Chinese, or japanese tonnage. His Majesty&apos;s Government would be unableto provide special escorts. Therefore, unless the transportsbringing the Chinese coidd be fitted into British convoys, itwould be necessary for the French Government to provide the escort.&quot;Abyssinian Troops. 2. The Prime Minister read a personal telegram indicating that^   s      y on his forthcoming visit M. Clemenceau would raise the question ofy/c^- /^-^ &apos;0 -    enlisting and employing Abyssinian troops.The Prime Minister asked the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff to consider the matter and advise the War Cabinet.Withdrawal of 3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that,French Divisions according to information received from Colonel Spiers, it was not at from Italy. present General Petains intention to ask for the recall of any Frenchy divisions from Italy.Italian Labour for 4. With reference to War Cabinet 3&quot;22, Minute 2, the Chief ofthe Western Front, the Imperial General Staff stated that a message from the British.     L-4/ Ambassador in Borne had been received to the effect that GeneralTjdf^/y. Foch had secured 100,000 Italian workmen for France.Transfer of german troops to theWestern Front.5. With reference to War Cabinet 322, Minute 4, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff reported that, from information derivedfrom General Knox, the Germans were transferring field and heavy artillery, scouting aircraft detachments, and ammunition stores fromthe Russian front, which they intended to leave without reserves.They were even dismantling railroads on that front to transfer therails to the West. One more division had arrived on the western front.Eoumama. 6. The   Bolshevist ultimatum to Roumania was referred to.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff observed that the BolshevistGovernment had little force to back it up, but that if the Ukrainewere to cut off Koumanian supplies the Roumanian forces would bey in a serious situation.Submarines &quot; G-8&quot; 7. With reference to War Cabinet 321, Minute 6, the Deputyand&quot;H-10.&quot; First Sea Lord stated that the British submarine &quot;G 8,&quot; now ninedays overdue, must be considered as lost. A Harwich report hadbeen received that submarine &quot;H 10&quot; was also overdue and wasbeing searched for by H.M.S. t: Lurcher.&quot;   He pointed out that
submarines on patrol in bad weather were more liable to accidentthan submarines on a passage.8. Questioned as to German submarines sunk in the english channel, the Deputy First Sea Lord said that two German submarines were thought to have been caught in the Dover minefield, but that this was not yet substantiated, and could not be for some time.9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to two telegrams received from Mr. Lindley, Petrograd, regarding theposition of the Corps diplomatique in Petrograd. The possibility ofthe arrest of our Embassy Staff had appeared, and, accordingly,Mr. Lindley had destroyed a number of cyphers and documents, and,in the event of the Bolsheviks pushing matters to an extreme, hewas preparing for the destruction of the remaining cyphers.Mr. Barnes stated that when he had mentioned the name ofTrotzki at his meetings in Scotland during the past week, it had beenreceived with cheers. Since then he gathered that a communication from Mr. Henderson, the Chairman of the British Labour Party, hadbeen addressed to the Bolsheviks. These and other circumstancesled him to believe that a public statement of our policy towards theBolsheviks ought to be made.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, from a purely Foreign Office point of view, there would be great advantages in cutting off all relations with the Bolsheviks. The latter had broken their treaty with the Allies, had repudiated their debts to us,and were openly trying to raise revolutions in all countries. TheItalian Government were anxious that this course should be taken.On the other hand, we still had great interests in Northern Russia,and a number of British subjects there whose position had to beconsidered. It was therefore necessary that communications of apractical kind should take place through agents. He was quite clearthat we could not give full recognition to the Bolsheviks until theycould show that they were representative of the Russian people.Mr. Balfour then read his reply, given in the House of Commons onthe previous day, to questions put by Mr. Ramsay Macdonald andothers.Mr. Barnes expressed himself satisfied with this reply.10. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the War Cabinetthat he had received a resolution from the Labour Party, asking thatthe consideration of the Military Service Bill should be postponed until the middle of the following week, by reason of the fact that anumber of the Labour Members could not be present in the House ofCommons owing to a Conference of Miners&apos; Delegates. He had hada personal conversation on the subject with Mr. Arthur Henderson,who informed him that his attitude to the Bill was one of strictneutrality.Mr. James Parker, M.P., said that several of the Labour members who would necessarily be absent until Wednesday of next week, suchas Mr. A damson, were strong supporters of the Bill.Major Guest doubted whether it would be possible to get thesecond reading of the Bill this evening, owing to the fact that therewas a likelihood of a certain amount of obstruction on the part ofMembers such as Mr. Pringle and Major David Davies, who, hethought, would raise the question of the Higher Command in France.Two amendments were down upon the Paper, one in the name ofcertain Ulster Members, who would probably press their amendment to a division, and another amendment in the name of Mr. Hogge.It was therefore unlikely that the Speaker would be in a position togive the closure until the following day.
Sir Auckland Geddes thought that the best policy would be togo straight forward with the Bill. Any sign of wavering would give an opportunity for the Opposition to pull together, and at presentthe press was favourable. The responsible Trades Union leaders hadbeen consulted for a month, and the Bill was urgent.The War Cabinet decided that The Bill should be pressed forward, and should be taken, ifnecessary, on Friday next, and again on Monday.11. With reference to War Cabinet 322, Minute 15, the WarCabinet had under consideration the following documents on thesubject of the proposed extension of the British front in France : -(a.) Joint  note  No.   10,   by  the  Military Representatives,Supreme War Council;(b.) Memorandum by Field-Marsha,! Sir Douglas Haig, with covering-note by General Sir William Robertson (paper g.T.-3343).The War Cabinet decided that This question could not be settled until the War Cabinet were fully acquainted with the grounds on which the military representatives based their recommendations ;and directed The Secretary to telegraph to General Smuts asking him, before leaving Versailles, to obtain from the Military Represen-tatives full particulars as to the reasons that led them toput forward the recommendations in question, and, inaddition, to ask the Military Representatives to send amemorandum of their reasons.Palestine. 12. With reference to War Cabinet 808, Minute 11, the Chief/ of the Imperial General Staff brought to the notice of the War&amp;7j-t^ei o . Cabinet the need of a very early decision being taken with regard to/ future  operations  in  Palestine  (vide   Paper G.T.-33-17  on  thesubject).The War Cabinet directed The Secretary to telegraph to General Smuts, asking him tocall upon the Military Representatives to the Supreme WarCouncil to hasten their report, as the matter requiredimmediate consideration.Extension of theBritish Eront inErance.National Salvage 13. The    War   Cabinet   had    before    them   the   followingBoard. documents : Memorandum by the President of the Board of Agriculture(Papers G.T.-3082 and 3338).Memorandum by the Food Controller (Taper G.T.-3279).Memorandum by Dr. Addison (Paper G.T.-3345).Memorandum by Mr. Hayes Fisher (Paper G.T.-3353).Memorandum   by   the   Secretary of  State   for War (paper g.T.-3358).Mr. Andrew Weir explained that for some time past the WarOffice had developed an organisation, complete in every detail, for&apos;dealing with wa,ste products iit the army, and it would be quitefeasible to expand this so as to embrace civilian waste-products.The organisation was under the chairmanship of the Quarter-Master-
14. The Secretary drew the attention of the War Cabinet to amemorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction with reference tothe decision of the War Cabinet on the 7th June, 1917, that parliament should be asked to appoint a Select Joint Committee ofboth Houses to consider the machinery of parliamentary procedure in the period following the termination of the war (War Cabinet 157,Minute 13).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he did not regard the Select Committee as practicable, and had arranged that dr. Addison should confer with the Government Whips on thesubject.The War Cabinet decided that The question should be postponed until a further communicationwas received from the Minister of Reconstruction.parliamentary procedure.The Building and purchase ofMerchant ShipsAbroad.Transfer to ministry ofShipping.y15. The War Cabinet had before them a joint memorandumby the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Shipping Controller,recommending that the responsibility of the building and purchaseof merchant ships abroad should be undertaken by the Ministry ofShipping, to whom the Director of Overseas Purchase and his staff would be transferred (Paper G.T.-335 7).The Secretary explained that, before the present Governmentcame into office, this responsibility had rested with the Board ofTrade. On the establishment of the Ministry of Shipping it hadbeen transferred to that Department. On the appointment ofSir Eric Geddes as Controller of the Admiralty in charge of allshipbuilding, mercantile as well as naval, it had been transferred tohim (War Cabinet 136, Minute 11). The present proposal was putforward as the result of actual experience.The War Cabinet approved the transfer.Tonnage forConveyance of chinese Coolies-f -516. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theShipping Controller (Paper G.T.-3244) in regard to stopping thetransport of coolies from North China to France.In his memorandum Sir Joseph Maclay submitted that, in viewof the present tonnage situation, the question of stopping the entireGeneral. Representatives of various Government departments could be added where they did not already exist.Lord Rhondda urged that an Later-Departmental Committee,with an independent chairman, was required to deal with theproblem as a whole.Mr. Wintour pointed out that it would be very undesirable tohave the control of the slaughter-houses, now under the Ministry ofFood, placed under the control of the War Office organisation.Further, it was most import;int that waste should be prevented inthe slaughter-houses rather than waste-products should be salvagedin the homes.Sir Worthington Evans said that the Ministry of Munitions didnot wish their organisation for dealing with scrap metal disturbed.It was doing considerable and valuable work and could be extended.Dr. Addison mentioned that Lord Salisbury&apos;s Committee wasalso interested in the question, and should be represented in any organisation set up.The War Cabinet asked Lord Derby to convene representatives of the Departmentsi/ concerned, to examine the whole problem and report.
import of coolies should be immediately considered. In addition tothe great relief which would be afforded on the Trans-Atlantic run,where it was not at present possible to meet, the American troops&apos;requirements, there was the heavy transit across the american continent. Further, it was estimated that 10,000 additionalAmerican troops might be brought per month (without baggage) ifthe coolie traffic was entirely stopped.Sir Joseph Maclay said that on his recent visit to France he hadinspected a certain amount of Chinese labour, and he was satisfiedthat four Chinese were not doing the work of more than one man.There seemed to be a total lack of organisation for dealing withcoolies, consequent, to a great extent, on the want of suitable fore-men, with a knowledge of Chinese, to take charge. In his opinion,the Chinese now in France, if properly handled, were more thancapable of doing all the work which it was intended should be doneby the 150,000 which it was intended to import. The ShippingController said that he had seen Chinese labour working in glovesand overcoats. They were over-fed and under-worked. They were becoming loafers and loungers, and were under no proper control.They were treated as Europeans rather than Asiatics.Lord Derby said that, while he was in agreement with much ofthe Shipping ControlleFs criticism about the lack of control, hecould not agree to stopping entirely the importation of Chinesecoolies. They were the only men on long three-year contracts.Other labourers, e.g., from India, Avere on short contracts, and there-fore, in the long run, required as much tonnage for their conveyanceas the Chinese. The whole question of the control of labour inNorthern France was under consideration, and he Avas sending out aman of experience to report on the matter. Lord Derby added thathe would consent, if the Shipping Controller agreed, to reduce theimportation of coolies by bringing only those actually enlisted, and thereafter 2,000 a month.Sir Sam Fay suggested that officials of the Canadian PacificRailway, familiar with handling Chinese labour on the Avesternportions of that raiLvay should be alkrwed to take charge of dealingwith the coolies. &apos;The Adjutant-General said that General Travers Clarke, the newly appointed Quarter-Master-General in Prance, who Avas now inEngland, was going to take over the Avork of supervision andcontrol of labour in North France. If the demands of france were to be met we could not stop the importation of Chinese. Wehad already stopped the importation of labour from the West indies and South Africa, and from India, unless the men signed on for the duration of the war. The only other possible source of supplyappeared to be Italy, where labour was expensive.The War Cabinet decided that A meeting should be held on the following day, 18th January,1918, at 330 P.M., when the Secretary of State for War,the First Lord of the Admiralty, and the ShippingController, with their advisers, including General TraversClarke, should attend and submit their views to the PrimeMinister.The Puller Use ofDieppe as a Portfor the british expeditionary force./17. The Slapping Controller informed the War Cabinet that onhis recent visit to the French ports be had been struck by the enormous quantities of stores, inflammable and otherwise, that werepiled up near Calais. Having regard to the comparative nearness ofCalais to the German lines, and to the great danger from hostileaircraft, which might any day cause the most serious damage, hesuggested that greater use should be made, if possible, of the port of Dieppe.
The War Cabinet concurred in this view, and decided that The Admiralty, in consultation with the War Office, shouldinvestigate the possibility of developing the port facilities at Dieppe to the utmost extent.18. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theShipping Controller (Paper G.T.-3352) regarding the possibility ofdiscontinuing the shipment of road stone to France. The present-programme provided for the shipment of (a.) 5,000 tons of slag per week ; and(b.) 4,500 tons of road stone.These quantities represented only about 10 per cent, of the require-ments of the army in France, the remainder being obtained by localquarrying.Lord Derby said that he would agree to discontinuing the shipments of slag, but that he could not agree to stopping the shipments of stone, as it was required, inter alia, for making cementfor pill-boxes, &amp;c.The Shipping Controller said that he had seen General Nash onthe subject, who had told him that the difficulty of obtaining supplies locally was one of rail haulage.While taking note of Lord Derby&apos;s strong dissent, the WarCabinet decided that, in view of the vital necessity of savingtonnage The Shipping Controller should stop the provision of tonnage for both the slag and the stone.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,January 17, 1918.
