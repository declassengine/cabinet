The western front:German Attack.Present Position.1-1. The Director- of Military Operations reported that theGermans had made a very heavy attack north of Peronne, and hadeffected a breach over a front of five miles. Two fresh divisions would shortly arrive there, namely, a New Zealand Division andthe 12th Division. The 3rd and 4th Australian Divisions, and the2nd Canadian Division were advancing towards that area, andhe was of opinion that the two first-named divisions should be intime to fill the gap. There were, moreover, 300 tanksin the neighbourhood. He stated that the 3rd Army hadbehaved splendidly, and had. repulsed the principal german attacks, and that the 5th Army were showing signs of recovery,inasmuch a.s they had counter-attacked the enemy and had drivenhim back across the Sornme, with the result that in that areaour line was continuous, and that he hoped the situation there wassafe until the French reserves had time to come up and fullyrestore it. General Maurice held the view that the emergency had now resolved itself into a question of time, and that to-day wasthe critical day. If the enemy got through oh the Somme battle-field, the battle would resolve itself into an engagement betweenthe reserves in the open. He stated that the Germans had adopted the same methods as those they had practised in Russia. They had had 59 divisions engaged up to the 23rd, and as soon as one division was knocked out they passed another division through it, and were carrying on without transport other than that which could accom-pany the attacking divisions. General Maurice added that 14German divisions had been transferred from the French front, andthat 12 French divisions were coming to our assistance. Asregards the likelihood of an attack on the French front, heindicated that no heavy attacks were probable, but that a localattack was possible in Alsace.At a later stage in the meeting, General Maurice reportedthat on the 3rd Army front the Germans had capturedBapaume, but that we held the outskirts at the rear of the town;that our line North of Bapaume was intact in spite of theGermans pressing their attack very heavily; that, they had made no progress in the gap north, of Peronne: and. that the New-Zeal and Division had arrived, and the 12th Division was in theimmediate vicinity; that the enemy were not pressing to the north-ward of Flam, but that to the south of Ham and St. Simon hardfighting was taking place between the Germans and the French.With a view to expressing&apos;the gratitude of the country forthe excellent defence which was being put up1 by our troops at thefront, and also wdth a view to sustaining the moral of the troopsthere, the &quot;War Cabinet requested The Secretary of State for War to send a telegram from theWar Cabinet to General Sir Douglas Haig, expressing their gratitude to the British Expeditionary Force, andinforming it at the same time that reinforcements werebeing sent as rapidly as possible, and that more guns were beins; supplied immediately than had been lost.ImmediateReinforcements andtheir Transport.2. The War Cabinet proceeded to consider the steps to betaken to reinforce Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, and lord derby informed the War Cabinet that the estimated losses sincethe 21st March were 53,000 men. It appeared that a total of106,000 men, of whom nine-tenths were infantry, were availablefor immediate transfer to France. To these should be added88,000 men at present on leave, who were part of the existingestablishment in France. Up to the 20th April, 18,000 trained men would be available as drafts, which meant that by the 20thApril 212,000 men were available for transfer from the UnitedKingdom to France.  As regards the transport of these men across
ythe Channel, Lord Derby stated that the War Office were anxiousto have the shipping resources in this connection improved, so thatthey might convey from 20,000 to 25,000 a day.The Minister of Shipping said he hoped to be able to arrangethis.The War Cabinet requested Ivord Derby, the First Sea Lord, and the Minister of shipping to go into this question immediately, with a view to thenecessary facilities being given for the transport of this number.Later Reinforee-ments.Additional Menfrom Munitions.3,eArmy ReserveMunition Workers.Recall of men released on Com-passionate Grounds.3. With reference to War Cabinet 371, Minute 8 (V), asregards a further supply of men. the Adjutant-General statedthat (a.) Approximately 25,000 men, who had served as soldiers,might be withdrawn from munitions.With regard to the proposal to take these men away from munitions, Mr. Churchill said that he considered it veryunsound. Of this number, 7,000 were employed in shipyards:3,000 were in blast-furnaces, on which the output of steel-plateabsolutely depended. This left 15,000 men, fit for general service,to be found from other sources, and he was firmly convinced thatit would be folly to move key men from gun industries, and themanufacture of tanks and aeroplanes. Having in view the factthat the Ministry of Munitions was at present releasing 100.000men for the army, he urged that no steps should be taken to with-draw a further 25.000 until the matter had been thoroughly gone into to see what fit men could reasonably be spared from theseveral industries under the Ministry of Munitions.The Adjutant-General said that (b.) Another 9,000 men might be taken from the army reserve munition workers.(c.) That a further number of &quot;A&quot; men. say 5,000 (theactual figures were now being gone into), could beprocured from men who had been discharged from theTerritorial Force on compassionate grounds,As regards taking soldiers from agriculture, the War cabinet held the view that it would be undesirable, as probably very few&quot;A&apos;-&apos; men would be forthcoming, to withdraw any men from thatsource until the sowing, &amp;e, bad been completed by the end ofApril.Taking the above possible increases, it appeared to the WarCabinet that the sum total of men available by these means for france was- 251.000.The Minister of Munitions, however, undertook to scrutiniseall sources of supply of man-power from the munitionsindustry, and to report as soon as possible.Troops in Ireland. L As regards any combing-out from the British troops now employed in Ireland, Lord French informed the War Cabinet thatat present there were in Ireland the equivalent of a division,approximately 13,000 strong, and 10 reserve battalions.The Adjutant-General said that of this force all the &quot;A&quot; men had already been removed, and he did not think that there were more than 2.000 &quot; B. 1&quot; men among the troops in question.
5. Field-Marshal Lord French suggested that the Volunteersmight be mobilised, and the Adjutant-General was of opinion thatif the army were allowed to take over the Volunteers they wouldbe able to get a good number of men available for France; it beingpointed out that the Volunteers formed the best half-trainedreserve that we had.Lord French stated that only about one-third of the Volunteershad taken the oath, and that legislation would be necessary before&apos;we could call on any of the remaining two-thirds (about 200,000men) for service, except in a case of national emergency.Sir Auckland Geddes stated that the Volunteers might bedrawn on by two means: (i.) By going to the tribunals and getting the tribunals to cancel the exemptions of fit men; and he had givenorders that endeavours were to be made to do this.(ii.) By bringing in a short Bill to cancel all exemptions,which would do away with tribunals.The War Cabinet requested The Minister of National Service to provide for calling upthe fit men among the Volunteers, as part of a DraftBill he w-as preparing.   (See Minute 14.)Wounded and 6. As regards other sources of supply, the question, was raisedDischarged Men. as to whether any men who had been wounded a,nd dischargedearlier in the war should be recalled to the Colours. It waspointed out in this connection that the Government were undera pledge not to recall such men. It was stated by Sir auckland geddes that, in his opinion, not more than 1 per cent, of the meny discharged were physically fit for service at the front.Mobilisation of volunteers.3.Modification of 7. The Adjutant-General informed the War Cabinet that theMedical Test. Director-General of Medical Services had recently been going intothe question of the standard of eye-sight required by the troops,and that a new test would shortly be instituted which should resultS  in the number of &quot; A &quot; men for*the army being increased.Assistance by theUnited states forces in France.4v78. The Prime Minister drew the attention of the War Cabinetto the fact that it might be possible to use the United States troopsin France, and stated that it had been suggested to him that the americans might put four divisions in the line in the Frenchsector.General Maurice suggested that the four American divisions should not be called upon to take over more line than at presentheld by four French divisions in a quiet sector, and that theseFrench divisions should then be sent to the battle front; further,that, as the American divisions gained experience, they should eventually enable two more French divisions to be withdrawn,for our assistance.The Prime Minister added that he had been informed thatof the two American displacement divisions, one was complete saveas regards transport, and he would therefore recommend that weshould supply the necessary transport for that division, and ask the United States Government to agree to its being placed in theline.It was further suggested that the Americans should be askedto send to our front such field-guns and heavy guns (together withtheir crews) as we might require from those at present allocated for the use of the American army.
It was also pointed out that there were 300,000 United states troops in France, and that of that number a considerable portionwere high-class engineers, who were now building cold storagedepots, &amp;o, and that we should urge the American Government tosend such men, as well as any Labour battalions that might havebeen formed, or could be formed, to the British front, with a viewto perfecting the existing defences and creating others in theirrear.At this stage the Prime Minister and the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs interviewed Mr. Baker, the United states secretary of State for War, and later informed the War Cabinetthat they had urged Mr. Baker to take the necessary steps to giveeffect to the assistance suggested above, and, as he was goingacross to France, to see General Pershing on the subject at theearliest moment.ft was mentioned that General Pershing had supreme powers as regards the allocation of the American troops in France, and theWar Cabinet therefore directed The Secretary to inform Lord Milner as to the points in thediscussion which had taken place, so that he might rendersuch assistance as might be possible in persuadingGeneral Pershing to issue immediate orders on thesubject.They also requested The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to send a personal telegram to Colonel House, notifying him of the pro-posals made to General Pershing. and pointing out the pressing need of such assistance.Marines from the 9. The First Lord of the Admiralty was asked whether theNavy. navy could assist by loaning to the army any Royal Marines.   Itwas suggested that the incorporation of even a few of these highly. trained and disciplined troops among the drafts for the battered3, battalions relieved  from the  battle front might prove of great value.   Sir Eric Geddes stated that the total marine establishment-/p       was 45,680 men.   Of these. 8,690 were in France as infantrymenvC- or gunners. 4,990  in labour corps, 1,410 in Mudros, 2.240 were employed in coast defence or in Ireland, and 400 in submarinemining. 17,870 were afloat in ships, 3,650 were untrained menunder the age of 19, and 3,800 were boys, bandsmen, or men employed as part of the training staff or men unfit and in hospital.There remained available for draft 1,930 (including 400 under&apos; 19); 1,324 of these were appropriated for draft; and the 4th R.M.battalion was 700 strong. As regards the men serving in ships,he explained to the War Cabinet the duties upon which marinesserving afloat, were employed, and instanced the fact thatthey manned the turrets, barbettes, groups of 6-inch guns, andperformed other duties intimately connected with the fightingefficiency of the ships as a whole, and that to withdraw such menin these circumstances would have a very serious effect on theefficiency of the Grand Fleet. It was also pointed out that, withthe United Kingdom now depleted of efficient army men, a far greater responsibility devolved on the navy for the protection ofour shores. Sir Eric Geddes stated that he would be only tooglad to go into the question of relieving, as far as possible, fromcoast defence or elsewhere, all men of the Royal Marines capableof manning heavy batteries.The War Cabinet approved this proposal, and requested theFirst Lord of the Admiralty to communicate as requisitewith the War Office on the subject.
Stoppage of recruitment forthe Royal Navy.Gun Position.!311. In connection wdth the losses of guns during the presentbattle, the Minister of Munitions was called upon by the WarCabinet for a statement as to what steps he could take to replace those that had been lost.Mr. Churchill stated that the question might be considered from the point of view of the guns (u.) Tn France or in transit to France;(b.) In the United -Kingdom in stock;(c.) In the United Kingdom under proof, or at the factory.Reserves of carriages and guns in France were not balancedin all cases.   But taking all stocks  into account, the maximum number of  complete equipments  that could be made up fromavailable reserves, including guns, and carriages awaiting proof,1 Was approximately -as follows: 18-pr. equipments     ... ... ...   6774.5-inch equipments   ... ... ...   337&apos; 60-pr. equipments     ... ... ...    1466-inch howitzer equipments    ... ...   2386-inch gun equipments ... ...     668-inch howitzer equipments    ... ...   1319.2-inch howitzer equipments ... ...     2512-inch howitzer equipments  ... ...     17making a total of 1,014 field guns,384 medium guns,239 heavy guns.There were,, in addition, a number of carriages under repairin France for which guns were available, and a considerablenumber of 6-inch and 8-inch howitzer equipments of obsolescentpattern.As an illustration of the output, Mr. Churchill stated that last week&apos;s output was as follows: &apos;18-pr. ... ... ... --.   145Carriages4.5-inch guns60-pr. guns ...6-inch howitzers55343356* Note by the -Secretary.-&apos;^ Admiralty and Ministry of National Service - have since agreed to reduce this to one month, after which the question will be reviewed again.t For figures since supplied by Ministry Of Munitions, showing estimated numberof equipments available on the 6th April, 1918, see Appendix./10. With reference to War Cabinet 37ft, Minute 10 (a), theMinister of National Service informed the War Cabinet that, withregard to the recommendations contained in the Report of theCabinet Committee on Man-Power, the total number of recruitsobtained from the 1st January to the 20th March, 1918, for theRoyal Navy and the Royal Naval Air Service were as follows: The Royal Navy   ... ... ...    12,616The Royal Naval Air Service ...     8,796The War Cabinet approved the stoppage of recruiting forthe Royal Navy and Royal Marines as follows: No person over 18 years of age, except certain skilled ratings,should be recruited for a period of* two months fromthat date.   The question should then be reviewed.As regards the skilled ratings, a considerable number wouldbe required for the army, and the two Services should put forward their requirements to the Minister ofv/ National Service.
17WG 372   1 858-inch howitzers       ... ... ...     179.2-inch howitzers     ... ... ...       612-inch howitzers     ... ... ...      1He mentioned that carriages were and would be the limiting factor, and added that, in view of the small number of guns thatproved defective whilst undergoing proof, he considered that it.was safe and reasonable to release all such guns and send themto the front as and when required, and had issued instructionsaccordingly.As regards machine-guns, Mr. Churchill stated that therewere in stock in Great Britain and France 1,200 ground patternVickers guns, as well as 600 awaiting repair. A further 1,300were in transit to France. There were 3,712 Lewis guns in reserve in France, and 3,200 in reserve in England, in addition to 2,000which were now&quot; in transit. They were now being produced at therate of 800 a week.12. The War Cabinet next proceeded to consider the questionof the extension of the existing system of recruiting in the UnitedKingdom.Sir Auckland Geddes pointed out that by raising the age limit to 45, approximately 150,000 men fit for general service wouldbecome liable to recruitment, and of these at least .30,000 couldbe made available for military service. By raising the age limit to 50, a further 250,000 men fit for general service wouldbecome liable to recruitment, of whom he estimated 60,000 couldbe made available for military service. The question, however,of increasing the age limit involved a large question of policy, andthe most careful consideration must be given as to the age towhich it should be raised and the method of carrying it out, sothat the resources of the country should be crippled as little aspossible. He therefore recommended that, before any decision was taken, the whole position should be most carefully considered.Further Recruiting:Raising the age limit.Ireland. 13. As regards applying the Military Service Act to Ireland,Field-Marshal Lord French pointed out that during his recent visit to that country he obtained the impression that two-thirds of3 . the Sinn Feiners were entirely influenced by their leaders, and hewas strongly of opinion that it would be possible, with a slight3 augmentation of the existing troops in Ireland, to maintain order^^,yy and still carry out any policy of army recruitment there.   Hef,m was further of opinion (and in this he was supported by the adjutant-General) that such Irish as were recruited should notbe put in Irish battalions, but embodied in English and Scotchregiments. He held the view that this procedure would be more acceptable to all concerned, inasmuch as the latter would welcome the Irish recruits, whereas the Irish regiments would be inclined to accord them less favourable treatment.It was pointed out that politically such incorporation wouldhave very undesirable effects, and would not encourage Irish unity,and would shatter any hope of the Convention being a success.The Minister of National Service stated that his estimatewith regard to Ireland was that within the present limits ofmilitary age 150,000 men fit for general service could be recruited,that by raising the age to 45 a further 25,000 could be obtained,and another 25,000 if the age limit was raised to 50. He addedthat, as tribunals would not be possible in Ireland, it would benecessary, if compulsory recruiting was made applicable to thatcountry, to abolish tribunals in England, and use the presentassessors as advisers, with no ruling powers.[1365-372]
Summoning ofparliament toconsider Bill:Minister ofNational ServiceDraft a Bill./to14. The War Cabinet considered the question of summoningParliament with a view to passing new legislation in regard torecruiting, and it was felt that it was imperative that advantage should be taken, of the present situation to obtain from Parlia-rnent powers to extend the Military Service Act to Ireland, and toincrease the age up to 50 or 55.The Wax Cabinet requested The Minister of National Service to prepare, at the earliest moment, a short Bill for the consideration of the WarCabinet, covering these two questions.Conscientious 15. Lord Derby asked permission of the War Cabinet toObjectors. send conscientious objectors abroad for labour work.It was pointed out by Sir Auckland Geddes that a pledgehad been given by the late Prime Minister and others that thiswould not be done.The War Cabinet felt that as these men. would be sent as anon-combatant corps, it was essential in the interests of thecountry under the present circumstances, that any pledges that had been given in this respect should be withdrawn, andinstructed &apos;Sir Auckland Geddes, when introducing&apos; in Parliament theBill referred to in the preceding Minute, to make a state-y ment on the subject.Ministers of 18. Attention was drawn to the fact that a very large numberReligion,,        :       of ministers of religion of excellent physique were available formilitary service, it being mentioned that the French and Germans,as well as other nations who  were oar Allies, employed their ministers of religion amongst the fighting troops.The War Cabinet decided that A clause should be inserted in the Bill rendering ministers of religion, within the limits of age laid down, subjectto medical fitness, liable for military service.Recruiting ofRussians.17. Sir Auckland Geddes informed the War Cabinet that the divisional High Court had given a decision on Saturday to theeffect that the Russian Convention still had legal force, and heconsequently asked for the approval of the War Cabinet to pro-ceed with the recruiting of Russians for labour battalions.Mi&apos;. Balfour stated that, in view of the serious situationprevailing on the Western front, it might be appropriate toover-ride the diplomatic difficulties which would arise as regardsrecruitment of Russians in this country.The War Cabinet decided To reverse the decision as set out in War Cabinet 845, Minute3, and authorised the Minister of National Service toproceed with the recruitment for labour work of russians in this country.Port Labour.18. The Minister of National Service stated that the releaseof port labour was being seriously delayed. Pie suggested that ofthe 8,000 required, a clean, cut should be made of 1,000-men whowere over 18 years and 8 months, but had not attained the age of 25upon the 1st January, 1918, and that the remaining 5,000 shouldbe given up by the 31st May, 1918, at latest, or earlier, if theTransport Workers&apos; Battalions were increased by 5,000 asauthorised by War Cabinet 352, Minute 9.
WG 372Medical Boards.Oalliug-up Notices.Mr. Wardle, of the Board of Trade, said that the position was difficult, and that if the immediate recruitment of these men wereinsisted on, the effect would be serious as regards our imports and supply of ore for shipbuilding, as well as the receipts of food supplies for the civil population, &amp;c.It was mentioned that the East Coast ports were not now being used. Mr. Wardle stated that very little port labournow existed in those ports. He added that no withdrawal fromthe Western ports should take place without simultaneous substi-tution. Moreover, taking away 1,000 men under the age of 25would seriously affect the discharge of ships.On the other hand, it was pointed out that our imports weresteadily decreasing, and consequently that less men were requiredfor port labour.In view of the urgent need of men for the army the WarCabinet approved The immediate withdrawal of 1,000 men under the age of25, and the combing out of the remaining 5,000 by the31st May at latest, or earlier, should the TransportWorkers&apos; Battalions be increased as authorised.19. The War Cabinet approved a proposal of the Minister ofNational Service to cut down the ordinary Medical Boards from1 chairman and 3 members to 1 chairman and 2 members, and the travelling Medical Boards from 1 chairman and 2 members to1 chairman and 1 member, thus speeding up the rate of examina-tion. The Travelling Medical Boards should then be able to dealapproximately with 90,000 men a week.20. The War Cabinet approved a proposal of the Ministerof national Service that the calling-up notices should be reduced from 14 days to 7 days, and authorised the Minister of NationalService to make a statement to that effect when the House ofCommons meets.Coal Miners.Withdrawal of Menfrom the Admiralty.21. The Minister of National Service informed the WarCabinet that after 50,000 miners had been taken (see WarCabinet 370, Minute 9), there would be approximately 200,000Grade I men over IS years and 8 months still left in coal mines.He stated that he was in consultation with the Coal Controlleras to the maximum number of these it was feasible to releaseif every possible economy were introduced. He added that anyfurther release would have to be made from whatever coalfieldcould spare men, and that the resolution of the Miners&apos; Federationthat the quotas should be applied all over the coalfields of GreatBritain proportionately to the total number of men employed, mustbe overriden.The War Cabinet requested The Minister of National Service to inform the War cabinet as soon as possible of the result of his consultationwith the coal  Controller.22. With reference to the withdrawal of 100,000 Grade men employed in the various munitions industries, and thearrangement by which Admiralty A firms were to release 12,500and dockyard and labour establishments 1,000 of this total, theMinister of National Service stated that these men were not being released as had been approved, and that consequently the whole position as regards recruiting of labour was being hampered. he pointed out that men in similar positions in other Departmentswho were working side by side with Admiralty men felt thatequality of treatment was not being meted out.
The Minister of National Service therefore asked that theWar Cabinet should direct the Admiralty and the Ministry ofMunitions to release at a sufficient rate to enable the 100,000 mento be posted before the end of June.The .First Lord of the Admiralty stated that the men were, notbeing released because no substitutes were forthcoming, in spiteof the arrangement made when the decision to discharge these12,500 men was arrived at.The War Cabinet requested The First Lord of the Admiralty to go further into thequestion with the Minister of National Service with aview to enabling the releases to be carried out as askedwithout detriment to the output of mercantile ship-building.23. A report was handed to the War Cabinet by the deputy chief of the Naval Staff which indicated that a spasmodic bom-hardment of Dunkirk and Malo had been carried out by theenemy from Lueder boom between the afternoon of the 23rd andthe morning of the 24th March. No damage of importancey resulted.German Submarine 24. The report also indicated that the German submarine&quot; Inter. 48.&quot; &quot; D.B. 48 &quot; had arrived at Ferrol in a damaged condition, and hads been interned.xA2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March 25, 1918.Bombardment of dunkirk andMalo.APPENDIX.Munitions Losses.1. The following are my revised figures for guns and carriages complete avail-able by the 6th April, including those in reserve in France and England, or in transitor at proof: 18-pr. ... ... ...   ,7974.5-inch Howitzer ... ...   39960-pr. ... ... ...   1646-inch Howitzer ... ...   292 , .6-inch gun      .........     74 j&quot; j otal equipments 190,8-inch Howitzer ... ...   1419.2-inch Howitzer        ... ...     2912-inch Howitzer ... ...     19 J&apos;These figures are in advance of my previous estimate in each class field,medium, and heavy though the details are varied. They differ from the revisedfigures given in the printed minutes by including the current fortnight&apos;s output,which can be handed over immediately without waiting for proof.2. There have been heavy expenditures and still heavier losses of small arms ammunition in this moving warfare, and General Headquarters has asked us for230 million rounds at once.   This can. be supplied.(Sighed) WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.March 26, 1918.
