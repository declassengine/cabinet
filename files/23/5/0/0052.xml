Questioned as to the likelihood of an enemy attack in the centre3 of the line, in the direction of Milan, General Wilson pointed outthat railways were lacking to furnish an adequate impetus to suchan attack; that the only two available passes were snowed up and well guarded by the Italians ; and that until summer no seriouseffort could be made. Another possible line of attack further West.       / involved violating the neutrality of Switzerland.   This possibility($r/s^y/S p-^ .     was being studied.[1365-360]
The western front:Transfer of german divisions.    ,GermanAeroplanes.2. With reference to War Cabinet 358, Minute 1, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff reported that there were 183 ascertainedenemy divisions on the Western front in France. The Frenchestimated a possible 8 or 10 more, as that number of divisionsremained unlocated. Questioned as to the possibility of theappearance of these divisions on the Italian front, General Wilsonexpressed the opinion that the known withdrawal of German troops from that front rendered this hypothesis an unlikely one, consideringthe strain such movements would put on the railways.3. due Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that aGerman airman, taken prisoner by the French, had stated that theenemy were going to bring up fifty new flights of &quot; Pursuers&quot; onthe Western front ; each flight, according to the informant, was toto have eighteen pilots, but this did not necessarily mean eighteenmachines.General Smuts expressed the view that each flight probablynumbered six machines.Possible German 4.

Aerial reconnaissance had revealed thepresence of a few new dumps and railheads, but no conclusive,/    evidence of anv immediate offensive.German Tanks. 5. Questioned as to the possibility of an offensive withoutpreliminary bombardment, but with the help of Tanks, general wilson stated that no enemy Tanks had as yet been detected on theactual front, although information had been received which indicated the possibility of the transport of German Tanks through Belgium.It was believed that the enemy had probably built as many as 400.The Commanders in the Field were well aware of the possibility of^  an attack of this nature and were ready with defensive schemes.British Tanks. 6. The Prime Minister decided to hold a discussion on Fridayafternoon next on the output of British Tanks, which was reportedto be unsatisfactory.

Questioned as to the career of the raider &quot; Wolf,&quot; AdmiralHope explained that she had remained in hiding, avoiding capturingships for considerable periods, and had. on the whole, done lessdamage than might have been expected.Mines in the heligoland Bight.1 1. The Deputy First Sea Lord read a report from Copenhagenof statements by interned German sailors that there were so manymines in the Heligoland Bight that German submarines now used the Little Belt and Sound almost entirely. This represented a loss oftime of from fortv-eight to ninetv-six hours.Murmansk :American Cruiserfor.12. With reference to War Cabinet 358, Minute 8, AdmiralHope reported that he learned from Admiral Sims that the QnitedStates Government was not at present willing to order a cruiser to murmansk, but that, if pressed by Lord Heading, they mightreconsider their decision.The War Cabinet decided that The Admiralty should send to the Foreign Office, for transmissionto Ford Reading, a telegram requesting him to approach the United States Government on the subject.J3elgian Fishing- 13. The Deputy First Sea Lord read a report from Penzancesmack &quot; Eduard that three survivors of the Belgian tishing-srnack t; Fduard Marie&quot;Marie.&quot; had been picked up.

With reference to War Cabinet 346, Minute I, attention was drawn to the statement made by Commander Bellairs on theprevious day, in the House of Commons, concerning the sortieof the &quot;Goeben&quot; and &quot;Breslau&quot; from the Dardanelles. this statement had got into Hansard, and, if correct, did not reflect credit to the responsible British naval authority concerned.The War Cabinet were given to understand that the statement in question contained exaggerations, but that the whole matter hadbeen investigated by the First Lord during his visit to theMediterranean, and that appropriate action had been taken.&apos; 15. With reference to War Cabinet 322, Minutes 12 and 14,the War Cabinet had under consideration a letter (Paper G.T.-3813)from the British Military Representative at. Versailles, stating thatthe Allied Military Representatives had agreed that the joint committees on Aviation and Tanks should consist of not more than five and not less than two members from each nation, and asking for the covering sanction of the British section of the Supreme WarCouncil.The War Cabinet were of opinion that, before arriving at adecision as to anv increase in the number of members on these
Committees, it was necessary that the matter should be consideredby the Departments concerned, and the War Cabinet thereforerequested The Secretary of State for War to arrange for the necessarydepartmental conferences to be held, and to report to theWar Cabinet the conclusions at which they arrived.Exchange of 16. With reference to War Cabinet 181, Minute 7, the WarInterned Prisoners. Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor War (Paper G.T.-3737) and a memorandum by Lord Newton(Paper&apos; G.T.-3744) on the subject of the exchange of internedprisoners.Lord Newton said that his proposal Avas that all civiliansinterned in the United Kingdom and Germany should be at liberty to return to their own country ; but that, as the number of Germanswho would probably aA&apos;ail themselves .of the permission estimatedat .15,000 is much in excess of the 3,000 (which number includesmen of the mercantile marine) whom Ave may hope to receive, acondition should be made that 5,000 British private soldiers shouldbe transferred to Holland from Germany, and that all mercantilemarine officers and crews now in Germany should be included among the civilians.Lord Derby pointed out that the Germans regarded the merchant seamen as combatants, and he thought the Admiralty were of theopinion that no action should be taken which might be interpretedby Germany that we regarded these merchant seamen as combatants.General Belfreld said he felt strongly that the proposed exchangeof prisoners should not take place, on the ground that avb had overand over again urged our Allies not to conclude any agreement Aviththe enemy regarding the exchange of prisoners. On one occasion the French had almost concluded an agreement Avith the Germansfor the exchange of prisoners, but had, on representations beingmade by us, repudiated the agreement.Lord Newton urged, in reply, that there was no ground forassuming that our views had influenced the French in any respect in the course of their negotiations and that it was not in our interests to associate ourselves with them.It was pointed out that the proposal ran directly counter to thedecision of the War Cabinet on 28th March, 1917 (War Cabinet 107,Minute 10); that the Admiralty, the War Office, the Home Office,and the Ministry of National Service Avere all opposed to the proposed exchange ; and that, in these circumstances, the War Cabinet could hardly override the opinion held by these Departments unless someneAv factor of great importance had arisen, and unless the Allies had agreed upon a change of policy.The War Cabinet decided that Lord Newton, if he so desired, should arrange with the Secretaryto bring up the matter for consideration at the forthcomingInter-Allied Conference to be held in London the followingy&apos; Aveek, but that otherwise no action should be taken.Re-afforestation. 17. With reference to reports from the President of the Boardof Agriculture (Paper G.T.-396), the Minister of Reconstruction(Paper G.-189), Lord Lovat (Paper G.T.-3319), the Forestry Sub-Committee (Paper G.T.-3342), the Secretary for Scotland.
