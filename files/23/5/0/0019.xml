Mr. Balfour stated that, in view of recent events inPetrograd, it was necessary for the War Cabinet to consider very8 seriously what our relations were to be with the Bolshevik Govern-,    ment.   We were the only Allied nation that had admitted a( Bolshevik representative; in fact, he gathered that we were theonly nation to whom the Bolsheviks had appointed a representative.No formal recognition had been given, but the necessary business was transacted through an agent, namely, Mr. Leeper, The main difficulty was that the Bolsheviks would not in the least mindquarrelling with us; they think that they have nothing to gain by keeping on good terms with England. It was a question, there-fore, whether the Bolsheviks would commit some act which would provoke a rupture.  He, personally, was inclined to the view that
we should postpone a rupture as long as possible, as it was quite clear that the Bolsheviks provided the Germans with moredifficulties than would be presented by the Social Revolutionaries.From the point of view of postponing a separate peace between russia, and Germany, and stopping the Germans getting suppliesout of Russia, it would appear that the Bolsheviks were more likely to effect such a policy than any other party in Russia. TheBolsheviks, however, appeared determined to spread what he described as &quot; passionate propaganda &quot; in this country, and alsoin Germany. He had been informed by Mr. Leeper that theBolsheviks are convinced that social and political conditions inGermany are very bad, and that internal trouble is inevitable inthe near future. This information is given them by one Raclek,an International Jew of the same type as Trotzki, who is in close touch with the German Socialist Parties. Two views were currentregarding Trotzki: one view Was that he was in the pay of theGermans, and was playing the German game; the other view,which seemed to be the more probable, was that he was a genuinefanatic bent on spreading the doctrines of revolution throughoutthe world, but particularly in the two countries which he regardedas Imperialistic, viz., England and Germany.Sir George Buchanan stated that he had always advocated apolicy which would prevent an open breach with the Bolsheviks.On the other hand, it was clear that we should, sooner or later,have to choose between a rupture and complete reciprocity ineverything.. For instance, if we did not allow Mr. Litvinoff to sendcypher telegrams, Trotzki would stop our representatives in Petro-grad from sending cypher telegrams. He would sooner see a rupture than allow Bolshevist propaganda to be carried on on alarge scale in this country, as such propaganda was dangerous,and attractive to those who had noth ing to lose. He thought thatit was clear that the Germans would like to see a rupture between us and the Bolsheviks, and would like our representatives at petrograd to be withdrawn, in order to* give them a clear field.Any step towards recognition by us would be exploited by theBolsheviks in their own interests. Regarding the Social Revolu-tionaries, he thought that, although more correct in their methods,they were less of a nuisance to the Germans. The SocialRevolutionaries had no backbone, and Avere, if anything, moreanxious than the Bolsheviks to make a separate peace withGermany. Two things tended to cause him to modify his viewthat we should, if possible, avoid a rupture with the Bolsheviks,namely, the recent maltreatment of the Constituent Assembly by theBolsheviks, and secondly, the possibility of the Japanese orAmericans, or both, giving effective, military assistance to those elements in Southern Russia who were inclined to resist theBolsheviks. In any event, he thought that the Bolsheviks wouldnot ask us for assistance.Questioned regarding the military situation, and thepossibility of preventing the Germans obtaining food and other supplies from Southern Russia, General Knox stated that, in hisopinion, a volunteer army in Russia was impossible. Quite seventyper cent, of the Russian troops on the Northern and Westernfronts had disappeared since the Revolution. As regards thepossibility of the Germans obtaining supplies from SouthernRussia, he thought that, even assuming a separate peace, if wouldbe fully six months before the Germans could obtain anythingimportant from Southern Russia. However, after six months theycould obtain practically all their requirements, which would ineffect break down the blockade. The only way to prevent thiseventuality was the creation in Southern Russia of some effectiveforce to resist German force. As regards the land, vetry littlesowing had been done on landlords&apos; property in South Russia,which meant that, unless the Germans could organise and get
possession of this land before April, very little surplus corn wouldbe available for export from Russia. The district of real import-ance was the Donet coal basin and whoever had effective possessionof this was in a position to hold up the transport and resources of practically the whole of Russia, but the high prices which theGermans would offer would draw grain to enemy countriesrather than to North Russia. A number of Russian officers had spoken to him in Petrograd with regard to the possibility of joining General Kaledin. As long, however, as we appeared to be giving any form of recognition or support to the Bolsheviks, itwas not likely that they would take this step. Our dealings withthe Bolsheviks undoubtedly decreased the effectiveness of the moral and material support we were giving to the Cossacks.General Alacdonogh stated that it would appear that theRussian armies were rapidly melting away. The Germans were preparing to advance their line to Pskoff, without meeting any form of resistance. Sixty per cent, of the Baltic fleet had deserted,and even on the Roumanian front the Russian troops were beingevacuated at the rate of twelve full trains a day, leaving material and guns behind. As to the available resources in Southern Russia,a man who had been in the Ukraine as recentlv as last October had informed him that there were large quantities of cattle in that part of Russia.Lord Robert Cecil reported that considerable difficulties hadbeen experienced in getting financial assistance to the Cossacksand other friendly persons in South-Eastern Russia. In thisconnection he drew attention to two telegrams that had beenreceived from Major Keyes, in which he suggested that if wecould advance 5,000,0007. to an un-named capitalist it wouldbe possible for us to get control of five banks that had branchesin the friendly territory, which would enable us not only to finance the Cossacks, but also to obtain control of important industrial resources in Southern Russia.The Chancellor of the Exchequer felt some difficulty in mak-ing such an advance to an unknown person, even on Major Keyes&apos;recommendation.General Knox stated that the unknown capitalist was probably Mr. Poliakoff, who was subsequently ascertained to bea Jewish banker of Rostov-on-Don, and who was known to GeneralPoole.Mr. Balfour then stated that he expected grave difficulties with the Bolsheviks over the question of recruiting Russian jews in this country in the British Army.In this connection Sir George Buchanan added that manyof the Russian Jews who had been repatriated to Russia in thelast few months had carried on propaganda against us.The War Cabinet were informed that the Foreign office were preparing Memoranda- on the questions of Japanese inter-vention and recruitment of Russian Jews, and the War cabinet decided To await the circulation of these Memoranda before coming to any further decisions.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,January 22, 1918.
