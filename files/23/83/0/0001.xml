DANZIG-.(previous reference cabinet-9 (21)Appendix 2. )FTP. ro^Oz-1,      The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs informed the Cabinet that at the forth-coming meeting of the Council of the League ofNations Danzig was likely to be the mosttroublesome question raised.      The Nazis havewilfully defied the G-overnment in Danzig andhave infringed the constitution in variousrespects.       His own policy was to bring home to the Polish Government the fact that they mustshoulder responsibility in this matter.    Danzighad been created a free city for the benefit ofUrthe Poles and if they wished/to continue as such,apparently they did, they must take theresponsibility^       The Polish Foreign Ministerappeared quite willing to do this but wanted semesupport from the Council including authority totake economic action against Danzig,  ifhimself.The Cabinet approved generally thelines proposed by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs,- 1 -*
LOCARNO TREATY,.G-erman doubts as!^bo Anglo-French,conversations andtheir effect on.(previous reference:Cabinet 20 &amp; 21(35) 1.)2.      The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that he was rather concerned at the apprehensions expressed in conversation by german representatives as to the Anglo-french naval, military and air conversations on the subjectof the position in the Mediterranean and at the doubtswhich they affected to feel as to whether these con-versations were consistent with the Locarno Treaty,His Majesty&apos;s M4s4s4^?/in Berlin had already taken thequestion up with the German Foreign Minister and theSecretary of State was ^in&amp;wuWi-ng^him^to make somerather stronger representations^      /n&amp;^i/^y^The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsadded that in order to ascertain the position inGermany he proposed to suggest to the Ambassador thathe should return to London on leave within the next two or three weeks.
THE ITALO-abyssinian dispute.The forthcoming meeting of theCouncil atGeneva.(previous reference:Cabinet 56 (35)Conclusion 2).5*      The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs informed, the Cabinet that it was unlikely that the Council of the Leagueof Nations would take any decision inconnection with the Italo-abyssinian dispute at their forthcoming meeting.    he himself proposed to report to the Councilon the conversations that had taken place with the French Government and certain other Governments as a safe-guard againstthe risks of sudden attack in theMediterranean.      We had nothing to hide andthe sooner the League was informed on what had been done the better.      He would try and arrange with M. Laval and other representatives to make correspondingstatements.The Secretary of State thought itcertain that the Committee of Thirteenwould meet but he did not imagine that theydo fcka.1&apos;would/more than take note -e-f the Paris Peacenegotiations. jUofinaM fold tied&apos; - fflfu. ^Uut,In reply to a question he said thathe was altogether opposed to the french proposal that all the Powers should takeItaliancharge of/diplomatic interests in abyssinia.
IE ITALO- 4.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theJYSSINIAN:SEUTE. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. 5 (36)),$ proposing that, at the forthcoming meetings of theie proposedibargo on Committee of Eighteen,  the United Kingdom representa-.1 supplies*r Italy. tive should not oppose the opening of a discussionupon the question of an oil embargo, and should support&apos;previous:reference. (though, if possible, not himself proposing)  theiabinet 5$$ (35)conclusion 4). setting up of an expert enquiry into the probableRR3(3 b)3.effectiveness of such a sanction.Should the United Kingdom representative find itdesirable to make any observations of a more generalnature upon the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto an oil sanction, he might indicate that in reaching a final decision on this matter His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be guided by (1) the extent to which an oil sanction could be made effective, and (2) theextent to which the collaboration of the armed forcesof other Members of the League could be counted on inthe event of a resort to arms by Italy against a Memberof the League participating in the application ofeconomic sanctions.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed(a) to approve the general line which theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs proposed to take on the question of an oil embargo as set forth in C.P. 5 (36) an summarised above;(b) to take note that the President of theBoard of Trade would put an expert on thesubject of the oil embargo at the disposalof the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairswhenever he required him at Geneva..
THE ITAL ID-ABYSS INI ANDISPUTE.The positionof theItalian Armyin Abyssinia.5*     The Cabinet had. &quot;before them a Note by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. 4 (36)),covering certain information regarding the positionof the Italian Army in Abyssinia which had beenobtained unofficially from two foreign newspapercorrespondents, who had recently returned to E^yptfrom Eritrea.After a short discussion the Cabinet took note:(a) That the Secretary of State fer War would circulate a Military Report he hadreceived on the position in Abyssinia,(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs would oiroulate some notes he hadreceived about the rains in Abyssiniashowing inter alia that the big rainsordinarily did. not begin until June,
THE ITALO- 6. The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsABYSSINIANDISPUTE. thought it unlikely that the question of the  bombing of the Red Gross would be raised inBombing of Geneva.      He himself proposed to warn thethe Red Cross.Italian Government as to the serious eon-sequences that would result from bombing theBritish Red Cross in Abyssinia - the more soas we had been accused in the French press ofmisusing the Red Cross. He would instructHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to take anopportunity to warn the Italian Government.The Cabinet approved this course.
4IJYPT.proposed Treatyegotiations.Previousisf erence jTabinet 56 (35)Jonclusion 3).M.7.   The Cabinet had &quot;before them a Memorandum &quot;by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. 6 (36)),dealing with the request of the United Front in Egyptfor a declaration by His Majesty&apos;s Government thatthey were prepared to conclude a treaty in the termsof the Nahas-Henderson draft of 1930.      Each of thethree main courses of action which appeared to be open,in the face of this demand, appeared certain to meet with a bad reception in iiigypt, and rioting and disordermight follow,  resulting perhaps in His Majesty&apos;sGovernment having to take control of the countrythemselves.In these circumstances the Secretary of Staterecommended a fourth course, namely, that the reply should be that His Majesty&apos;s Government were quite prepared to enter forthwith into conversations with theEgyptian Government, with the object of arriving at an anglo-Egyptian treaty settlement, but that in view ofthe paramount importance of its military provisions       -  !;His Majesty&apos;s Government suggested that as a preliminary;to negotiations the two Governments, with the help of      ttheir military advisers, should discuss confidentiallyand as potential allies the application of the military  1terms of the 1930 Draft Treaty to the changed situation of to-day.      If we were pressed further we should haveto make it clear that it was not possible to discussother matters in detail, pending agreement on themilitary provisions, and that we cannot considerourselves bound by the provisions of the Draft Treatyof 1930, or by the provisions of any other inconclusivenegotiation.
111 J.The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that the general principles onwhich his proposal was based were (l) to avoid giving a blunt refusal to the &quot;Egyptian -request;(2) if a negotiation were attempted to dealwith the hardest part first and (3) keep the conversations in Cairo.In the course of the discussion various suggestions were made including the following -(i)    that the High Commissioner in egypt should be given confidentially theinformation that if the draft Treaty of1930 were accepted as a basis it would atonce arouse suspicion and opposition inthe House of Commons,but that parliament would not object to starting de noyq)with the negotiations; and that he might ex-plain this to Egyptian politicians;(ii) that it was very important not to enterinto negotiations with the possibility ofany misunderstanding as to what was meantby the basis of 1930,as this was likelyto raise difficulties from the outset;(iii) that the High Commissioner should be warned that the provisions of the draftioTreaty of 1930 was as far s His Majesty&apos;^Government were likely to be prepared totorg0j.(iv) that the following formula mighVt be usedin the telegram:If, as we hope, the new negotiationresults in mutually satisfactoryagreements (i) on the militaryprovisions (ii) on the Sudan, thiswould certainly greatly affect our ability to deal with other matters onthe 1930 basis and we are convincedthat this is the proper order ofdiscussion.-8-
(/)   that as en. alternative to the above it  .should merely be stated that if wecould get agreement on the militaryquestions it would facilitate the task of reaching agreement on the othermatters mentioned in the 1930 draft treaty;(vi)    that it must not be overlooked that these negotiations raised the $hole considerationof friendly political relations with egypt;    if we failed, Egypt was likely tobe a turbulent and unreliable State, andthat we could not afford to have.The Cabinet agreed:(a) to approve the general proposalsof the Seoretary of State forForeign Affairs as set forth in C.P. 6 (36) and summarised at the head of this conclusion;(b) to leave the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to decide on the instructions to the HighCommissioner in the light of thediscussion and of the proposalssummarised above.-i 9 -*

The Cabinet had before them the following Papers,-A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies (CP. 2 (36)),bringing before the Cabinet two points of detail in connection with theestablishment of a Legislative Councilin Palestine, viz.  (i) the elegibilityof women to sit as Members of theCouncil,  (ii) the extent to which theproceedings in Legislative Council shouldbe privileged.A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies (CP.  3 (36)),showing that the principal&apos; demands madeby the Arab leaders, other than their demands in connection with the proposedLegislative Council, were that jewish immigration should be stopped immediately and. that the transfer of Arab lands toJews should, be prohibited by law.The latter Memorandum set out certain measureswhich, in the view of the High Commissioner forPalestine, might be taken in order to mitigate Arabdiscontent.     These included a proposal that, exceptins-a) The Beersheba Sub-District,[b) Urban areas,c) Land already planted with citrus,no landowner should be permitted to sell any of hisland unless he retains a minimum area sufficient to afford him and his family a means of subsistence.This minimum area would be inalienable and would, revert to Government should the owner-occupier cease tocultivate it.After some discussion, the cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the proposal of the Secretaryof State for the Colonies that negotiations on the new constitution for palestine should be conducted on the basis that women should not be disqualified from membership of the Council.(b) To approve the proposals in CP. 2 (36)for the following arrangements affectingthe proceedings in the PalestineLegislative Council:(1) That there should be an official report of the proceedings in the-10-

The Secretary of State was asked,,however,  to arrange that this should applyto the sale not only from Arabs to Jews,but also to anyone else including otherArabs,
