Conclusion 4).A Memorandum by the Prime Minister as^previous Chairman of the Committee of Imperial DefenceReference:Cabinet 4 (36) covering a Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (CP. 25 (36):A telegram sent by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to Sir Miles Lampsen of 7th February, No. 68,  asking his views on certain military aspects of the Treaty which had been raised at the meeting of the Committee ofImperial Defence on the 6th February:A private and confidential telegram fromSir Miles Lamnson dated 8th February, No. 125containing his proposals.The Secretary of State for War read    to theCabinet a telegram the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff had received from General Dill, the Directorof Military O-oerations and Intelligence, who is on leave in Egypt, the effect of which was as follows:Since the consent of the Egyptian Govern-ment can only be secured on the basis of friendship and co-operation between the armed forces it will be impossible to secure controlover Egyptian ammunition.      Consequently,little importance is attached to the retentionof the Citadel and magazine.      The best tacticswould be to offer at the outset to surrenderthe Citadel and Kasr el Nil to the Egyptians asan earnest of our confidence in them as friendlyallies and subsequently to lay stress on theimportance of the British and Egyptian forcesbeing similarly armed in every respect andlocated together in the best strategicalpositions.       The dispositions for the defenceof Egypt must include a joint force situatedon the Canal for its protection which would be tantamount to a recognition of joint responsibility for the defence of the Canal;the securing of Alexandria by a. joint force which would also be a reserve for the western desert; as well as a headquarters and jointreserve near Cairo as the centre ofc ommun i c at i ons.We might also consider offering to hand over the coast defence already installedat Alexandria as a further -concession.- 1f&amp;LO-EGYPTIAN The Cabinet had before them the followingIls-TY: military aspects CP. documents on the subject of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty:&apos;
The General Officer Commanding objected toHelouan as a substitute for Abbassia on the groundthat although healthy and with good training facilities the rail and road communications with Alexandriaand the Suez Canal are too unsafe.      Nevertheless,he prefers Helouan to the Canal Zone for the reserve.All towns in the Delta and Zagazig areimpractical from a health point of view as well asfrom that of barracks and training owing to intensecultivation and the network of canals.      these considerations are not applicable to Belbeis since it is situated at the edge of the cultivated area butit is not suitable for training purposes owing tothe flat desert to the East and the sand dunes tothe South.After considerable discussion, the cabinet agreed:(a) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should approve the first two ofthe following progressive stages proposedby Sir Miles Lampson in his telegram, viz:A. That until such time as Egypt to the satisfaction of both parties is in aposition herself adequately to assumeprotection of her own territory, it is agreed that the Forces (military, navaland air) of the two parties shall beregarded as pooled with common interestwith corollary of no limitation as tonumbers, dispositions and so forth.And that while this was unlikely to beobtained we might, as a first move^,suggest it &quot;for exploration and study&quot;which would give our Service experts afull opening to explain technically andin a spirit of joint interest(&quot;potential allies&quot;) the precisestrategical considerations and lessons4&apos;to be drawn from the Italian crisisand at present joint defensive measures.B. Presuming a failure to secure (a) wecould then fall back upon concessionsfor evacuating Kasr el Nil barracks and Citadel and withdrawing    toAbbassia and Helmieh.      The retentionof these could be based partly onjoint strategical interest (e.g,communications, base for reserves,etc.) but also on the value to egyptian troops of daily contact andtraining alongside British forces,fullest facilities for the latter being guaranteed.      This would ofcourse all be elaborated in the planoy authorisation of expert discussions.(b) That a decision as to the course to be adoptedif neither a. nor B. above could oe securedmust be reserved while further information is secured, as specified below.(c) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs
should ask the High Commissioner in Egypt to give further explanations as to the meaning of his praposalC which was not clear to the Cabinet.that the Secretary to the Cabinet should ask for furtherexplanations from the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee asto whether they attached any value at all to theStation at Helouan.    The Cabinet fully realised thatthe Chiefs of Staff regarded the maintenance of theexisting Barracks at Abbassia and Helmieh as theminimum consistent with safety and much disliked,on military grounds, a station such as Eelouan southof Cairo (CP.  25 (36) paragraph 16),    Since, however,the Cabinet might at some point have to choose betweenno Treaty at all and a Treaty which involves militaryrisks they wish to know whether Helouan would be a factor of any military value at all.    To put theproblem more precisely -Supposing the Chiefs of Staff had to choose between the following courses (hothof which fall short of their minimum requirements) whicn would they prefer ?(i) A Treaty securing right to stationtroops -a) in the East on the Suez Canal;&quot;b) in the West for the defence of theWestern frontier at or preferablynear Alexandria;(c) at Helouan;or (ii) (a) and (b) without (c).In answering the above questions theChiefs of Staff should consider whethereither of these proposals would be more acceptable to them if the total british forces in Egypt were increased.that the above information should be available ifpossible for the next meeting of the Cabinet onWednesday, 12th February at 11 a.m.to approve Sir Miles LampsenTs proposal that our military proposals should be rendered more palatableby a declaration of our intention to couple withthem the giving to Egypt of a free hand as regardsthe increase and modernisation of her army ( theexpense of which alone should be sufficient to keep it within reasonable limits) on the condition ofi) the attachment of a British military mission and ii) toie purchase of all equipment from us.to approve the remaining recommendations of the-Committee of Imperial Defence as set forth in cp. 25 (36) subject to the following:(i) that a decision should be reserved on paragraph 23 of the Report by the Chiefsof Staff Sub-Committee (C.I.D,  1212-Battached to CP. 25 (36)) dealing with thepossibility of allowing the Egyptians toman the permanent coast defence ofAlexandria and recommending its refusalr
(ii) that the following recommendation inparagraph Y of CP. 25 (36)That His Majesty&apos;s Government must remain exclusively responsible forthe security of the Suez Canal;    no right to participate in this responsibility should be conceded tothe Egyptian Government.should not be interpreted as necessarilyprohibiting the granting of permission to the Egyptian Government to stationa small number of troops (e.g. a battalion or a few companies) withinthe Canal Zone as an earnest of the sincerity of our desire for co-operationwith Egypt as an ally but that thiswould only be permitted on the distinctunderstanding that no abrogation orweakening was involved of our responsibility for the security of thsSuez Canal.(ft)     to take note that the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs would raise the question of theSudan later on.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.,10th February, 1936.
