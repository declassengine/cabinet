PREVENTION OP -L*    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byDAMAGE&quot; BY DEERIN SCOTLAND. the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. 75 (36))calling attention to the damage done by deer to agriculture in some parts of Scotland, and asking for authority to submit to the Home AffairsCommittee a draft Bill setting up regional commitees who would advise frem time to timewhat lands should or should not be used as deerforests, who would have power to keep the numbersof deer under control,  etc.      These were eontro-versial matters, and the Secretary of Staterecognised that his proposals were likely to meet with criticism both from the Labour Party andfrom land-owners.      The representatives of thelatter had, however, taken part in conferences,together with the representatives of the farmers,and both had been in substantial agreement withhis proposals.In the absence of the Secretary of Statefor Scotland, absent indisposed, the Cabinet agreedwithout discussion:To authorise the Secretary of Statefor Sootland to submit to the HomeAffairs Committee a draft bill as proposed in CP- 73 (36) and summarised above.
9 9^*j is! iTHE naval conference.(previous^Reference:Cabinet20 (36)Conclusion 5)*2.      The First Lord of the Admiralty reportedthat a Naval Treaty would be ready for signaturenext week between the United Kingdom, the UnitedStates of America and France.        It was, however,unlikely in the case of Germany that a position could be reached when a Treaty could be signed:temporaryfirstly, there was the/ban imposed by the cabinet at the meeting referred to in the margin:    and secondly, the German representative had a difficulty about signing before the Russians had also agreed toa bilateral Treaty.       He had been told that we ought not to allow the Soviet Government to upset the Treaty;    that a safeguarding clause would beincluded; and that, in any event Russia could not within the next five years build on a scale sufficientto upset the Treaty. But he had had to consultBerlin on the subject and a week or so might elapse before he received his instructions.       Meanwhile,the French and United States Delegations (who hadto leave England next week) were pressing for asignature. Unless the Americans could leaveon March 26th, the last hope of an Americanratification this year would vanish since Congresswas due to rise on May 1st. He was mostunwilling to sign with a reservation in regard to ratification for the reason that, so far, he had succeeded in avoiding any reservations at all tothe Treaty.of the admiralty in the circumstances the First Lord/asked the Cabinet to authorise him to sign a Three-PgwerTreaty without waiting for Germany&apos;s signature ofthe bilateral Treaty, but on the understanding thatthere was no question of our ratifying the TreatyTreaty.
3-9 the First Lord, of the Admiralty added thatthis course was supported by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.In reply to questions the First Lord ofthe Admiralty stated that there was no clause in theTreaty stipulating ratification by any particulardate:  also that the Italians were with-holdingsignature on technical grounds, but their objectionswould disappear if apd when their political difficulties were removed.The Cabinet agreed:To authorise signature of a Three-Power Naval Treaty on the understandingthat it would not be ratified unlessor until a corresponding bilateralTreaty was concluded with Germany.

The Cabinet had before them the county courts BILL,Courts Bill, 1936, to be introduced by a private member on Friday, 20th March.The Lord Chancellor said that the object ofthis Bill was to extend the jurisdiction of theCounty Courts. The Bill ought to be handled fromthe Government&apos;s point of view by one of the LawOfficers of the Crown who should be briefed.      In his view the Bill should be opposed.The suggestion was made that there was agood deal to be said for extending the jurisdiction of the County Courts.The Prime Minister thought there was a gooddeal to be said for keeping the discussion on theEmployers&apos; Liability Bill going as long as possible.

9 9 9tj       WGERMANY ANDTHE locarno treaty.tpreriousReference:!Cabinet 20 (36)).PA Hrecalled that when the Cabinet has last discussed this question M. van Zeeland&apos;s draft proposals had proved unsatisfactory to France;    M. Flandinhad promised to present a scheme to the locarno powers, other than Germany;    and the Cabinet had approved proposals for him to communicate,  if andwhen he thought fit, to the other Locarno Powers.He had since circulated the British &quot;suggestedprocedure&quot;.      The Secretary of State then gave theCabinet a detailed account of what had sincetranspired as set forth in a telegram of 18th March,Paris, Brussels, Rome and Berlin, which is attached in Appendia I. This telegram ta^es the storyup to 12,30 a.in. on the day of the Cabinet meeting.There had been a subsequent meeting on that veryday from 12 noon to 3.0 p.m.  (with a short intervalfor a light lunch in the Foreign Office) at which(See telegram in Appendix 11)*the conversations had been further pursued/     Thethree main differences of opinion recorded in the telegrams,to which had been added a fourth, could be summed up as follows:(1) As to the method of restoring inter-national law oy some action in respectof the Demilitarised Zone, our proposal&apos;for an International Force on bothsides of the frontier was unacceptable to m. Flandin.      He could agree either toa Franco-Italian force in France as evidence of the support of theguarantor Powers, or to an international force in the Demilitarised Zone only,to a(2) AG-Ae&apos;tter which the French and belgian governments wished His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to address to them as to the steps which we would take, including economic,financial and military sanctions, in theevent of Germany&apos;s refusal to acceptthe terms offered to her.
to the(3) As/ attitude of the French and belgian governments to the suggestion that germany should go to the Hague Court over the franco-Soviet Treaty.      They argued that both parties must bind themselvesin advance to accept the decision of theCourt.      If the judgment went against france, the Franco-Soviet Pact must beannulled;    Dut in the event of itgoing against Germany, Locarno must tfomeinto force with all its provisions.As to(4)/military conversations between the british general Staff on the one hand and thoseof France and Belgium on the other onwhich they insisted.The Secretary of State further reported thatsubsequent to the above meeting of the Locarno PowersM. van Zeeland, the Belgian Prime Minister, had undertaken to use his good offices with M. Flandinto try and. secure a modification of his attitude.He had just received a communication from M. vanZeeland which he had not had time to study.      Froma preliminary glance, however, he gathered thatthe Belgian Prime Minister had had some success.In respect of the tnird point mentioned above, hethehad secured agreement that whatever/result of the reference to the Court, the political negotiations should continue,     as regards point (l), M. Flandinhad accepted a proposal that had been made by theLord Privy Seal, namely, that in the demilitarised zone the Force should be international, and on the franco-Belgian frontier it should be composed of forces of the guarantor Powers.     The proposedletter (point (2) above) was now in a differentform.      On the subject of the military conversationsthere was no change.The Chancellor of the Exchequer expressed doubts as to whether m. Flandin realised thatthere would be British troops on both sides of thefrontier under the Lord Privy. Seal&apos;s scheme.- 8 -
o 9 itjhe german attitude.military conversations,So far as the Germans were concerned, theSecretary of State reported that Herr von Ribbentrophad probably reached London already and he was tosee him at 8.0 p.m.      He would be present at themeeting of the Council arranged for the following morning.      In reply to a suggestion that theGermans would reject the Lord privy Seal&apos;s plan forthe occupation of the Demilitarised Zone by anInternational Force on the ground that itdifferentiated between Prance and Germany, theSecretary of State replied -chat he would have topress the Germans strongly to make some contribution towards a settlement.      He anticipated that theCouncil would pronounce on the German violation ofthe Zone at the meeting on the following day after hearing the German case.The Lord Chancellor reminded the Cabinet thatit was unnecessary to say anything to the Germansabout their accepting in advance the decision of theHague Court as that was provided for in the Treaty.The Cabinet next discussed the question ofthe proposed military conversations.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that the situation would be eased if we could agree to military conversations.      From the most recent document he had received from M. van Zeeland,it was clear that these were Intended - to relateto the obligations of the powers concerned under the locarno Treaty if the negotiations with the Germansfailed.The Cabinet were reminded by several members that military conversations on that basis would be very unacceptable to public opinion in thiscountry which was strongly opposed to any forcibleaction to compel the Germans to evacuate the
Demilitarised Zone.     Moreover, we were not in aposition to give e ffective military support in anysuch operation as the French were well aware.      the conversations would only accentuate this aspect.It was pointed out that there was no question of immediate action as contemplated in the Treaty sincethe time for that had already passed.      There was general agreement that in these circumstances no military conversations should he agreed to unlessthe range over which they were to extend was veryclearly defined.      On the one hand the Cabinet were informed that if some military conversations werenot agreed to there was grave risk of an earlybreak down in the conversations of the Locarno Powersother than Germany.       It was suggested that thebest plan would be to offer military conversationslimited to action to be taken to resist a german aggression.        Even this was criticised on the groundthat public opinion would not appreciate how limited the scope of the conversations was to be and wouldjump to the conclusion that there was somethingbehind and that the conversations were bound toextend to cover action against Germany.ortifications In this connection the Cabinet were remindedin the demilitarised that there was a grave danger that at any momentZone.the Germans might start to erect fatificationsin the Demilitarised Zone.      The French Government,who wished to prohibit any German fortificationeven in the eventual settlement, would be certain to treat any immediate fortification as a furtherbreacn of the Locarno Treaty.      They would representsuch fortification as bearing an aggressivecharacter in so much as the Germans would thereby be
O O isenabled to hold the Demilitarised Zone with fewerthroughtroops and to release forces for attack /  Belgiumor Holland.       They would claim that to beginfortification entitled them to at tacit first as a defensive measure.The Cabinet were reminded that Herr vonRiboentrop&apos;s instructions.were understood to be toagree to no limitation in the  one.      It was suggestedthat in asking for military conversations the Frenchand Belgians had this possibility of German fortifications-tions in mind.This led to some discussion on the french general case.The Cabinet were informed that the Frenchargued that unless the Germans thought that the otherLocarno- Powers meant business they would refuse tonegotiate.      If, on the other hand, a bold front was shown they would come to terms.      The French furtherrepresented that the Germans were as yet being askedto do nothing in the way of admitting their fault inbreaking the Treaty.      Apart from these considerartions the French and Belgians were actuated by a conviction that,unless Germany was brought to reason now,therewas a certainty of war in two years&apos;  time - whichthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs regrettedto say was not an Improbable forecast.      By that timethe Germans would be relatively better prepared thanthe Locarno Powers.      It was not improbable that theymight have gathered allies to themselves sincesome of the smaller Powers would tend to rally to a country which not only possessed force, but had shown itself prepared to use force.It was suggested that from the point of view ofBritish policy, it was inexpedient to let M. Flandin
o 9 nreturn to Paris in order to tell the french people that we would not support France, first,oecause we were weak - notwithstanding that therelative position of the Locarno Powers, otherthan Germany, would toe no stronger in two years&apos;time, and, second, because public opinion would not support forcible action.       There was considerableprospect that if M. Flandin haa to make such astatement the present French Government would falland might be succeeded by a Government anxious toally itself with Germany.      For this latter coursethere was reported to be a considerable movementin Paris.On the other hand, it was pointed out that france would be obtaining considerable advantagesif the following proposals were adopted:- .(i) Military conversations limited to defence against German aggression;(ii) Negotiation as to the demilitarised zone;(iii) International troops, including British,in the Demilitarised Zone, and Britishtroops on the Franco-Belgian frontier;(iv) A continuance of the obligations of the locarno Treaty during negotiations;    and(v) An eventual Pact of Mutual Assistance.If the matter were presented in this light it wassuggested that the French delegates would thinktwice about rejecting our proposals.It was suggested that in view of theprecarious position of the French Government, itwas not worth while to make any great concessions to them.     At the present time the attitude ofthe British public was strongly opposed to any military action to drive the Germans out of the demilitarised Zone.      Indeed, it would be difficult
$ 9 9di nJ- 0to argue in favour of military conversations withthat object when the Hague Court might conceivablysay that they were entitled to be in the Zone.    what might happen if Germany proved very obstructive inthe forthcoming conversations, it was difficult tosay.     One suggestion was that in that event peoplemight agree to economic and financial sanctions,though admittedly this involved some risk of war.For the moment, however, there was general agreement that military conversations should only be agreed toon the understanding that they were limited todefensive action to repel a German aggression againstPrance or Belgium.      To encourage the French to think we could go further would only be to deceive them,and a great deal would have to happen before therewould be any change in public opinion in this respect.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed outthat it would hardly be possible in the time availableto give M. Flandin a signed document before he left for Paris on the following afternoon.      He should be told, if necessary, that we could not be rushed andit was his own fault in leaving so early if he couldnot get an agreement.    It might, be suggested to him that he should tell his own people that he had hada number of conversations;    that they were not yetcomplete, and that he was returning to London.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that his main anxiety was as to the effect of a failure to reach agreement among the Locarno Powers,other than Germany, on Germany herself.     Suchfailure would not improve the prospects of gettingthem to help.The object of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and the Ministers associated with him
in these negotiations had been to report to the $Cabinet and to obtain a general impression oftheir attitude and not to seek actual decisions.The general tenor of the Cabinet&apos;s views on thepoints of difference that had arisen in the conversations may be summed up as follows:-(a) The Lord Privy Seal&apos;s proposal for the stationing of an International Force,including British troops, in the demilitarised Zone and for British andItalian forces on the French side of thefrontier, was welcomed.(b) The proposed letter to the French and belgian Governments as to our action inthe event of Germany&apos;s refusal to acceptthe terms offered to her, was rejectedin any of the forms that had been mentioned at the Cabinet.(c) The difficulty as to the attitude ofthe French and Belgian Governments to thesuggestion that Germany should go to theHague Court had been solved byM. van Zeeland&apos;s latest communication.(d) Military conversations must be strictly limited to mutual arrangements for defence in the event of German aggression against france or Belgium during the period of negotiation, and this would have to bemade unmistakably clear in any announce- iment to the British public.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,without opposing the general line as summed upabove, warned the Cabinet that negotiations on this basis were liable to break down that night.
THS GERMANOCCUPATIONOP the rhineland.Herr von ribbentrop&apos;sreportedview.7.    In the course of the preceding discussion the attention of the Cabinet was called to a telegramfrom Sir Eric Phipps (Berlin) No. 109 of the 18thMarch reporting that Herr von Rihhentrop had strongly-supported the occupation of the Rhineland and had eventold the German Chancellor that it would he warmly welcomed in England.     He was convinced that the vast majority of the British people was pro-German.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs asked that any of his colleagues who might come in contact with Herr von Rihhentrop might disillusion him onthe above subject.

V/e remarked that it would naturally be necessaryto be allowed some little time for the  study of the text ofthe French proposals before pronouncing upon them;    at thesame time we felt bound to make a preliminary observation tothe effect that we thought that the proposals as they stoodwere hardly in matter or in form such as we could endorsein a belief that we should be able to make progress towards an international settlement.      We added that, from a firstreading, several of the phrases in the paner were such as would be regarded by Germany as in the nature of a dictatand that therefore, if the Locarno Powers other than germany were to agree upon them,w e must expect the same attitude
from Germany as that country had previously adopted in similar conditions.      Belgian Prime Minister then-remarked-that in his view the text did show marked concessions by theFrench from their original point of view.      At the same time he admitted that there was some force in the criticism thathere and there the wording was not happy.      No doubt MonsieurFlsndin would,, however,, be willing to consider any amendments in this connection.     Monsieur Flandin immediately stated thathe would be very glad to do so.      He attached no particularsignificance to the form in which his statement was made andwas prepared to examine any amendments which might be suggested.We then turned to consider the United Kingdom draft.      Weexplained to the Locarno Powers that we had sought in this draft to do something to meet the position of Franc-0 and Belgiumin each of the three  stages.      For the first stage there was theconstatation and the reference to the Hague Court;      for thesecond3 i.e. that pending negotiation, there was a re-affirmation of Locarno and the suggestion of an international force,in which this country would probably have the greater share;    andfor the third stage there was the creation of a new system of security which would consist of non-aggression pacts for theWestern Powers with Germany, together with a super-structureconsisting of a pact of mutual assistance which would be open toGermany3 but which would be negotiated between England, Franceand Belgium whether Germany entered into the scheme or not.The French delegation appreciated the importance of thisdeparture from the previous position of successive british governments on this subject.      Monsieur Flandin remarked that,while he appreciated the significance of the international
force, this was different in form from his conception of it.since in our paper it would he stationed in both countries.He wondered whether it would not be possible to give Francesome additional security for the intervening period - after all the negotiations might never take place.      Could we notexamine the possibility of having Staff conversationsduring the period which preceded negotiation of the newpacts?     This would do much to steady French opinion.    Weexplained to Monsieur Flandin that the object of the inter-national force was precisely to give that sense of security which we thought would thus be given more effectively thanby Staff conversations.In conclusion both Delegations agreed that they would further examine each other&apos;s papers and see what progressthey could make in conciliating each other&apos;s points of view.In particular, the Belgian Prime minister was asked to pre-pare a paper for that end.      It was agreed that the delegations would meet again last night to attempt to reach agreement upon a text.      Monsieur Flandin remarked as he left that he thought our two points of view were not intruth so very far apax^t though there was naturally a difference in presentation, owing to the different points ofview of our two public opinions.The further meeting of the Locarno Powers was held atthe Foreign Office at 10 p. m.   last night continuing untilIS. 30 this morning.We opened the proceedings by asking M, Van Zeelandto be good enough to give us the text which he had preparedas a result of the agreement reached at the morning meeting.This M.  Van Zeeland did, reading to us the text of eachArticle.      Some general discussion then took place fromwhich it emerged that there were three main points of
difference.      First, as to the method of restoringinternational law by some action in respect of the demilitarised zone.      Our proposal for an international force on both sides of the frontier was declared byMonsieur Flandin to be unacceptable to him, he could agree either to a Franco-Italian force in France as evidence of support of the guarantor Powers or to aninternational force in the zone only.      The seconddifficulty was the letter which the French and belgian governments wished His Majesty&apos;s Government to address to them as to the steps which we would take,  includingfinancial, economic and military sanctions in the eventof Germany&apos;s refusal to accept the terms offered to her.The third difficulty lay in the attitude of the Frenchand Belgian Governments to the suggestion that germany should go to the Hague Court.      They argued that both parties must bind themselves in advance to accept thedecision of the Court.      In the event of that judgmentgoing against France,  the Franco-Soviet Paot must beannulled;    in the event of it going against GermanyLocarno must come into force with all its provisions.At the conclusion of the discussion it wasagreed that M.  Van Zeeland&apos;s text should be further examined by the other Delegations and the conversationswould be resumed later in the morning.

Phipps (Berlin) No. 64.Foreign Office, 18th March, 1936, 11.00 p.m.---------------- /My telegram No.  76298164.Following is record of further informal discussion between ministers of four Locarno Powers held between noon and 3.30 p.m.to-day.      Begins:-We went through the text put forward by the Belgian PrimeMinister last night.      The main, though by no means the only,difficult points raised were four.First for the interim period pending negotiations boththe French and belgian Governments are insistent that military conversations should take place between the Locarno powers in view of the violation of the Treaty.      We reserved this point for further consideration until after the question of aninternational force had been discussed.Secondly   the Hague Court.     As to this, the French delegatesinsisted that if the Court was to find against Germany then the Locarno Treaty must be restored in its entirety.      Wepointed out that this meant that if Germany were to accept togo to the Court and the verdict went against her,  then she would be expected to leave the zone.        It was unlikely enoughthat Germany would consent to go to the Court in any event,but on such terms it seemed to us inevitable that she would refuse.      Moreover, if such a decision were reached by theCourt it was clear that Germany would refuse to withdraw fromthe zone, and how could she be compelled to go?     The Frenchdelegates, however, persisted in their attitude.
We then discussed the international force, and we agreedthat we should endeavour to persuade the German Government toaccept an international force for the zone itself.      This theFrench and Belgian delegates maintained would considerablyease their attitude.Finally we examined the text of a letter which the Frenchand Belgian Governments wished us to address to them.      By theterms of this we were asked to undertake that in the event of failure of negotiation we would carry out our Locarnoobligations to the full, including military, naval and aerialaction.      Belgian Prime Minister suggested that this lettermight be kept secret between us.     We stated that a secretletter was impossible, and in this the French supported us.We also maintained that we could not sign any letter drawn upin such terms.      Its effect on the Germans could only be tomake them refuse to enter negotiations at all.      Moreover,was it really suggested that we should say to the Germans&quot;Either you will accept this, or there will be war&quot;?   M.Flandinstrongly contested the statement that sanctions meant war.    Inthe face of the recent experience he thought it quite impossibleto maintain such an attitude.      If the League would not carryout its duty now, then it was the end of the League, and inany case France could not continue sanctions against Italy ifthey were not imposed against Germany.      We refused to discussthe latter point in the presence of the Italian delegate, and stated that in our view there was no analogy.      leaving out of account the obligations of the Locarno Powers, the members ofthe League had no obligation under the Covenant to enforcesanctions in this instance.    &quot;Moreover, the League had nevervisualised military sanctions such as were now contemplated.How could military sanctions be enforced without war?
We then discussed the international force, and we agreedthat we should endeavour to persuade the German Government toaccept an international force for the zone itself.      This theFrench and Belgian delegates maintained would considerablyease their attitude.Finally we examined the text of a letter which the Frenchand Belgian Governments wished us to address to them.

We stated that a secretletter was impossible, and in this the French supported us.We also maintained that we could not sign any letter drawn upin such terms.      Its effect on the Germans could only be tomake them refuse to enter negotiations at all.     Moreover,was it really suggested that we should say to the Germans&quot;Either you will acceipt this, or there will be war&quot;?   M.Flandinstrongly contested the statement that sanctions meant war.    Inthe face of the recent experience he thought it quite impossibleto maintain such an attitude.      If the League would not carryout its duty now, then it was the end of the League, and inany case France could not continue sanctions against Italy ifthey were not imposed against Germany.      We refused to discussthe latter point in the presence of the Italian delegate, and stated that in our view there was no analogy.     leaving out of account the obligations of the Locarno Powers, the members ofthe League had no obligation under the Covenant to enforcesanctions in this instance.    &quot;Moreover, the League had nevervisualised military sanctions such as were now contemplated.How could military sanctions be enforced without war?
M. Flandin replied that he did not visualise militarysanctions.    What he had in mind was a financial sanction milderthan that applied against Italy, and possibly the refusal to allowGerman ships to come to the ports of the Locarno Powers.      He pointedout to M. Flandin that his text went far beyond this.     M, Flandinsaid that he had done his utmost to meet our point of view in the conversation.      There was a point, however, beyond which he couldnot go, and he was bound to tell us that if we could not accept this letter or something like it he feared that agreement would beimpossible and he would have no choice but  to go back to Paris.
