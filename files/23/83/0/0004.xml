GERMANY. 1*      The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs--- reported that he had circulated accounts of his con-(Previous versations with a number of distinguished persons whoReferenceCabinet had visited London in order to attend The Late King&apos;s3(36)Conclusion Funeral.4).His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlin had visitedLondon and after personal consultation with him theForeign Office were drawing up a paper on the Germansituation.      As there was a good deal of detail to be worked out he hoped that the Cabinet would postponediscussion on the matter until the following week.Broadly speaking, however, he had reached the view thatthe policy of reconditioning the Defence services must be accompanied by some attempt at an arrangement the political sphere with Germany, although he couldnot at the moment specify when and in what circumstances.He hoped to circulate a Memorandum before the next regular weekly meeting of the Cabinet.
THEMEDITERRANEANLocarno Treaty.(previous reference cabinet 1 (36)Conclusion 2).2*      The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said,that M. Flandin had suggested the conclusion of a mediterranean &quot;Locarno&quot; Treaty as an element in someeventual arrangement for settling the Italo-abyssinian dispute. He himself had adopted a reserved attitude.If, however, the matter was proposed again he would liketo take up the position that we were not opposed inprinciple but would want to see the details beforeexpressing an opinion.The Cabinet accepted the above view.m
FRANCE. 3.    . The First Lord of the Admiralty said he--- understood that the French were approaching us forRelations co-operation or good offices in various matters,with,e.g. the Mediterranean Locarno just referred to and,if he was correctly informed, some kind of financial(previous reference accommodation.       At present the French were makingCabinet 25(34)Conclusion 3).    themselves very unpleasant in the matter of the Naval. 62 lylo)^.  Treaty, and he hoped that this would be taken intoconsideration in any negotiations that might takeplace.,The President of the Board of trade reported that the French had also made themselvesmost objectionable about quotas.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that a year or two ago we had given the French some financial accommodation, on certain conditions, inthe carrying out of which the French had provedvery unaccommodating.       He had already been asked if he gave any accommodation at the present time toobtain various conditions required by the Presidentof the Board of Trade and he did not want to beimposing too many conditions. He would,  however,see what could be done.
4.      The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that from indications he had received from variousquarters the Egyptian attitude towards a Treaty was not altogether unpromising including that of the King cfEgypt. He was anxious to enable the HighCommissioner in Egypt to get ahead with the negotiations the Cabinet were informed that a Report bythe Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee would be circulatedthe same afternoon.After a short discussion the cabinet agreed:(a) that the question cf the proposed treaty with Egypt should be considered by theCommittee of Imperial Defence on the afternoon of Thursday, February 6th at.00 p.m. in the Prime Minister&apos;s roomin the House of Commons, and that theLord Chancellor should be invited to theCommittee for this discussion;(b) that the results of the meeting of theCommittee of Imperial Defence should be reported to the Cabinet which should dealwith them either at a special meetingor at their next regular weekly meeting,as the Prime Minister might decide.
!ITALO-! abyssinian&quot;dispute.Oil supplies for Italy.Naval measures in the-Mediterranean.jGerman military attache&apos; to theItalian Army.(previous reference:Cabinet 3(36jConclusion 3).5*      The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said he had nothing to report as to the progress of the Leagueof Nations enquiry into an oil embargo.      The instruc-tions to the British representative on the Committee hadbeen to adopt an entirely objective view.      He thought the enquiry would take about a week.        In reply to aquestion as to the prospects of the American NeutralityBill passing, he stated they were not good.The First Lord of the Admiralty expressed thehope that if an oil embargo was not to be applied it mightbe possible to relax our naval measures in theMediterranean. The continuance of the Fleet at alexandria was very inconvenient for the navy.The Cabinet were informed that a german military Attache/ had been sent to the headquarters ofthe Italian Army. It was explained that it would be rather difficult for this country to ask to send aMilitary Attache&apos; owing to the fact that as a member ofthe League of Nations we were treating Italy as an aggressor. It was difficult for a country that wasnot impartial to send an impartial observer.
lOPGSED INQUIRYNTO FORKINGLASS EXPENDITUREND REVISION OPHE BASIS OF THE$0:CIAL COGT-)F-EIVING INDEXJMBER.previous[Ref erence;Cabinet 2 (36),inclusion 6.)16, In continuance of the discussion at the meeting referred to in the margin, the Cabinet had beforethems-A Memorandum by the Minister of Labour(CP. 11 (36)) proposing an inquiry intoworking class family budgets, followedby a revision of the basis of theofficial cost-of-living index figure.A furtner Memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (CP. 19 (36)), prepared as aresult of the previous discussion.      Inthe course of this Memorandum it waspointed out that those wages which moved in accordance with the index number werein almost all cases fixed in relation tosome date within recent years.      It was important not to upset these wageagreements, and this made it necessaryto maintain continuity between thepresent index number and any new series.- As had been pointed out by a Committeeof the Economic Advisory Council in 1931,this need cause no difficulty.      If moretnan one monthly figure were published,the prominence should be given to that figure which was continuous with theexisting series.      In general it was proposed to adopt the 1931 principles and methods,  subject to reconsideration of certain points.      It would be necessary,for example, for the purposes of the ministries of Health and Agriculture,  toobtain budgets from the families of theunemployed.A Note by the Secretary (CP. 16 (36))covering the Report of the 1931 committee referred to above.The discussion at the Cabinet was concentratedmainly on the political difficulties arising out ofthe two aspects of the enquiry, namely, the informa-tion required for amending the Cost-of-Living Index figure and that required for those engaged on Nutrition.It was pointed out that for the former purpose it wasnecessary only to examine the budgets of an appropriatenumber of working class families of employed persons.For the nutrition enquiries, however, information wasalso required in regard to families of unemployed persons.

It -For nutrition purposesIt was pointed outthat considerable political difficulties would beexample? it were shown that the amount of money spenton nutrition by the family of an employed man was greater than that spent by an unemployed man there wouldbe a demand for raising payments to tuiemployed personswhich the country might not be able to afford, and thewhole question would, be raised as to whether the moneyspent on nutrition wasyin fact, expended to the best advantage. A suggestion met with considerable supportthat it might be advisable,  in the first instance, to announce the enquiry into working class expenditure for the purpose of re-calculating the basis of theofficial   Gost-of-Living Index Number which was attopresent indefensible, but not at present/mention theadditional enquiries to be made from the point of viewof nutrition.       Another suggestion was that the enquiries required in regard, to the cost of nutritionneed not necessarily proceed contemporaneously with the enquiries in connection with the Index figure and^, mightbe postponed for a short time.The Minister of Health said it would benecessary for him to make some enquiries before hecould express a considered view on this.The Cabinet agreed:(a) to give general approval to the proposalsof the Minister of Labour in CP.19 (36);(b) that the Ministers concerned should consider the matters raised at theCabinet in connection with the enquiryespecially in regard to publicity and liable to arise out of these enquiries.If, for
report to the next weekly meetingof the Cabinet.
APPLICATIONFOR REMOVALOF ROGERCASEMENT&apos;SBODY TOIRELAND.17*      The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary (Paper CP.  3 (36))  stating thatan official communication had been received from Mr.de Valera asking that the remains of Roger Casement(who was executed for treason on 3rd August, 1916,and buried in Pentonville Prison) should be transferredto Ireland for the purpose of interment there.Mr. de Valera7s despatch stated that there was a wide-spread desire in Ireland that this should be done, andthat this desire was shared by the Government of theIrish Free State.After recalling that various applications fromCasement&apos;s relations and others had been refused, theHome Secretary expressed the view that the right course was to adhere to the refusal of permission, both on thegeneral and particular grounds set out in his Memorandum,The Home Secretary also suggested that in replying to the Free State Government it should merelybe stated that the request had been considered, but thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom were,unable to comply with it.     A formula on these lines would sufficiently cover the legal and other objections to the proposal.After a short discussion the cabinet agreed:That the reply to the Irish Free State shouldbe to the effect that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment do not find it possible to departfrom their invariable practice of refusingpermission to such applications^
