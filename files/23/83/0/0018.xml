9 Q (?0 vI GERMANY.The locarno treaty.Iperman Re-occupa-Kion of theDemilitarisedZone.I previous reference:jCahinet 17(36)fConclusion 1).FA1.       The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs gave the Cabinet an account of the conversationshe and the Lord privy Seal had held withrepresentatives of the French, Belgian and italian governments in Paris on the previous day.      BothMinisters were impressed by the complexity andgravity of the situation which confronted Europe,and more especially our own country as one of theguarantors of Locarno.       On the outcome of thepresent situation depended the course of events inEurope over the next ten years, and it had to beremembered that our influence was greater than thatof any other nation,At the outset of the conversations the two ministers had been surprised at the identity of theFrench and Belgian views, especially when it wasremembered that M. van Zeeland, the Belgian PrimeMinister, was Flemish, and a man of independentcharacter.      Nevertheless, he ha a taken the same view as the French,The Ministers had sooa  discovered that our xpolicy of condemning the German action and thendeveloping a constructive policy to re-establish the.European situation had no chance of acceptance, - *The Secretary of State then read a Memorandumof a private conversation he had had withM. van Zeeland, whose views were especially cially important in the light they shed on FrenQh and Belgian publicopinion.      Both nations felt that, if the Germanchallenge was not taken up now, a much more formidablesituation would arise in two years time.     At themoment these peoples believed that the risk of warbeing precipitated by firm action was remote, but
that if Germany was allowed to remain unmolestedin military occupation of the Rhineland, war in twoyears time was a certainty and would he fought undervery unfavourable conditions.Hitler was believed to have acted underpressure from Goring and Goebells and contrary to theview of the German General Staffjxud- fdt^l^LlZa Frenchman had told him that the French people were &quot;au bout des nerfs&quot;.      They felt that if germany could tear up the Locarno Treaty they would have no confidence in German good faith or in any guaranteeTreaty.      If that was to be the result, France wouldnot leave the League of Nations, but any Governmentwould become a laughing stock that continued to rely on collective security.      They would fall back on theformer system of alliances to secure themselves, and,if driven to that course the French and Belgians would say that it was due to oui* failure to implement ourLocarno obligations.On the previous evening the two British ministers had reached the conclusion that our policy of tryingfor a negotiation was still the right one, and the only hope of securing a peaceful outcome.      The alternativeproxjosed by the French Government for forcing theGermans out of the Rhineland would not produce asatisfactory settlement.If a negotiation was to take place, three pointshad to be taken into account:-(i) A vindication of international morality.That was essential for France andBelgium:(ii) a reasonable regard for the position into which Germany had got herself:
(iii) Reassurance to France and. Belgium of support in any new Treaty to replace Locarno.The next question that arose was how best to proceed.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs&apos;  suggestion was as follows:To send for the German Ambassador that very evening.To tell him of the acute consciousness of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment of the very grave situation created by theGerman action, and to speak quite plainly as to the feelings of His Majesty&apos;s Government and of the House ofCommons on the subject.     He would point out thedifficulties into which the Germans had plunged HisMajesty&apos;s Government and would remind him of our ownguarantee under the Treaty of Locarno and of what our obligations are, as well as of our reputation forfulfilling our obligations.       To emphasise how in-excusable the German action was vis-a-vis Belgium whohad no   part in the Franco-Soviet Alliance.       He would emphasise that despite all this we were anxious to obtain a peaceful settlement;    that we were not asking for anything impossible;    but that we wanted some contribu-tion from Germany to give our efforts some prospectof success in the difficult circumstances.    What hewould ask Hitler to say would be that, having stated thathe wanted to negotiate a series of new pacts as a basis for peace in Europe, he would, as a proof of hisintentions, withdraw all his forces from the Rhinelandover and above the troops necessary for a symbolicoccupation.    In addition that, pending the conclusion ofthe new pacts, for the regularisation of the situation, heshould not reinforce the &quot;symbolic&quot; troops, nor buildfortifications in the demilitarised zone.    He proposedto fortify this request by reminding the german ambassador that in his first communication he had stated that the number of troops would be small and limited to a symbolic occupation.       He proposed to
add that. If Herr Hitler would do this he wouldhe doing something to help us in working for a peaceful settlement, and we would then do ourto get negotiations under waytest/- but as the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs explained later - he would be careful toavoid any optimism or undertaking.The Secretary of State then informed the cabinet that French Ministers had not exercised anyundue pressure on the Lord Privy Seal and himself.Nevertheless, unless at the forthcoming con-versations they could be confronted with some new factor such as he had suggested,&apos; he thought it inevitable that the French and Belgians would bothannounce their intention - if Germany could not be persuaded to evacuate the demilitarised zone - toask the Council /jf the League to make a pronouncement.Then,  if Germany was still obdurate, they would proceed to military measures and ask us to do thesame. In that case we should have to decidowhether we intended to fulfil our Treatyobligation - and we should be in an impossiblepooition if we refused.In reply to an inquiry as to the pos ition-of Italy, the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that the Italian Ambassador in Paris had notdeparted from the Italian point    of view that thejcould not undertake any obligations while they themselves were exposed to sanctions.

At&apos;onemoment M. Flandin had suggested that this could easily be got over by withdrawing sanctions, but he himself had given no encouragement to that remark.In the course of discussion the question was
raised as to what would he the French and Belgianattitude if we approached Germany without prior consulation with them.The Lord Privy Seal pointed out that if france was approached on the sub. ect it would appear in theFrench press next day and this would probably ruinall chance of its acceptance by Germany.The suggestion of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs was then discussed from the point ofview of its probable reception by Germany andFrance respectively.It was pointed out that tnere was a risk that herr Hitler might ask for an assurance of Britishneutrality if he fell in with the proposal.      In that event we should have to try and get an assurance from the French that they would not march into the rhineland.      From the German rjoint of view a disadvantage of the proposal was that it would handicapus in asking for a complete withdrawal of german forces from the Rhineland.        It was pointed out alsothat Herr Hitler might ask as a condition of acceptance for an assurance that France would not enter the Rhineland.      It was realised that Herr Hitlercould only be expected to consider the proposalfavourably if it came from the United Kingdom Government.If the suggestion were to be postponed until after themeeting of the Locarno Powers (other than Germany) inLondon, he wo^ld be almost certain to reject it.Consequently, the suggestion, if   made at all,must bemade the same evening in order to give Herr Hitlera chance of accepting it the following morning, inwhich case,  the meeting of the Locarno Powers would be presented with this new factor when they assembled.Even so, it v/ould be necessary to make quite clear to herr Hitler that the proposal had been made
spontaneously by the United Kingdom and was not aproduct of the Paris meeting.So far as Prance was -Concerned, it was realised that there was a risk that when the french ministers heard of the suggestion they might say thatthey did not agree.      They might object to it on theground that if accepted it would thwart the policy that they themselves and the Belgians intended tofollow.      In short, they might suggest that we hadbetrayed them behind their back.In this connection it was suggested that a stage would very soon be reached in the forthcomingconversations when it might be necessary to tell the French our position as to the possibility offulfilling our obligations under the Locarno Treaty.That subject, it was admitted, might be fraughtwith grave issues for the future of the League ofNations and the principle of collective security.From information given by the Service Ministers it transpired that our position at home and in home waters was a disadvantageous one, whether fromthe point of view of the Navy, Army or Air Force,or anti-aircraft defence. In addition,public opinion was strongly opposed to any military action against the Germans in the demilitarised zone.        In particular, the ex-Servicemen were very anti-French. Moreover, many people,
hJ tj &amp;perhaps most people, were saying openly that theydid not see why the Germans should not re-occupy the Rhineland,        In these circumstances,  it was generally accepted that it was worth taking almostany risk in order to escape from that situation.Admittedly the suggestion of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs involved some risks from the pointof view of the attitude of Germany on the one hand,and France and Belgium on the other, hut we couldembarrassinghardly be left in a more/ position than we v/ere inalready. Moreover, public opinion would considerthat the Government had taken a reasonable step in handling the situation.Some discussion took place as to what would bethe position of the Council of the League of Nations.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs explained that the Council&apos;s obligation would be to pronounce on the German action.        It had no obligationto proceed to military sanctions.      This was why he had asked whether the French Government contemplatedmilitary action by the Locarno Powers only, andM. Flandin had replied &quot;yes&quot;.     At this point theSecretary of State read an extract from the leadingarticle in &quot;Figaro&quot; of the    11th March.The Prime Minister thought at some stage itwould be necessary to point out to the French thatthe action they proposed would not result only inletting loose another great war in Europe.      Theymight succeed in crushing Germany with the aid ofRussia, but it would probably only result in Germanygoing Bolshevik.The Lord Privy Seal said their reply would bethat if they did not take action now there would onlybe a war under much more -adverse conditions in threeyears&apos;  time.      The French and Belgians sincerely
? Q Qhi o&apos;believed that the Germans would not fight if they took action.Some members of the Cabinet were very scepticalabout this assumption.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out that at bottom the French nation was verypacifist.      what they really apprehended was the outbreakof a serious war in three years&apos;  time when germany was re-armed.      He shared their conviction as to this danger.The Secretary of State for war pointed out thatin three years&apos; time, though we should have reconditionedat any rate to some extent our small forces, yet bythat time Germany would have 100 divisions and a powerful fleet.      We should not relatively, therefore,be in a better position.One suggestion was that we should adopt theproposal of the French and Belgian Governments to begin with financial and economic sanctions.      In supportof this it was pointed out that it was known from various sources that Dr. Schacht had opposed there-occupation of the Rhineland owing to his apprehensions of economic and financial sanctions, more especially the resulting inability of Germany to secure foreign exchange.      That was bound before long to bring abouta financial crash and this would force Germany to decideeither to come to terms or to fight.        In the latterevent, particularly if they attacked France or Belgium,public opinion both in this country and in the world as a whole would rapidly change.      The objection tothis course was tnat the United States of America, and perhaps other nations, might refuse co-operation, andeconomic pressure co^ld not then be supported withoutblockade which woald be very difficult.
The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out in this connection that the Franco-Belgianproposal had been for the imposition of sanctions by successive stages culminating in military action.fH&amp;edif fa i-rcJ\&apos; IS \ The Lord- President of the Council wasP* r    ,d clXir  $apprehensive of what would happen if^(jZa^ I ^^^^^^^^l&apos;tfh Uti&amp;fUt-^^^d^hen Fraa^e turned againot^-it&apos;.      France might easily\0m fV&amp;cfrki      lask what business we had to make this proposal withoutMitk* QjMft*a.&quot;*]     consulting them as it really involved opening upn0 &apos;      /negotiations.      That, he thought, would create a situation worse than the present one,  since it would arouse an indignation that would besmirch us.       He was reluctant to go back on a friend before agreement wasreached as to how the problem was to be handled.In general, he was favourable to the suggestion of theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, but he asked theCabinet to consider how it could he put most effectively to Herr Hitler.     &quot;Would it not be possible, for example,to   put it forward, not as a definite proposal, but rather in the form of passing our own thoughts over to herr Hitler to help him in getting out of the difficult situation he had created for himself?     He returnedto this suggestion several times during the discussion.The Lord Privy Seal said he had gathered from private conversation that the French were as anxious not to have to fight as we were, but were convincedthat Germany would not resist.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read aMemorandum of a private conversation he had had withM. van Zeeland before leaving Paris, in the course ofwhich the Belgian Prime Minister had made certain proposals which did not differ very widely from his own.
The Prime Minister pointed out that at thetime when Locarno was signed the Government had felt that the commitments could he accepted without undue risk owing to the strength of the French forces and the fact that Germany was totally disarmed.When the Disarmament Conference failed and Germanystarted to re-arm, the Government here started to dothe same.      In a democratic country, however, a gooddeal of time was taken to educate public opinion andweget a plan accepted, and consequently/were now caughtat a disadvantage.     All that was perfectly well knownto the French Government, and it seemed very unfriendlyof them to put us in the present dilemma.      people would take a long time to forget it.      He himself had said at the Election that he was never going intosanctions again until our armaments were sufficient.He felt that the French ought to welcome our comingre-armament rather than expose us to the presentembarrassments.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled thatthe Prime Minister had said in Parliament that it wasthe task of this country to try and bring France andGermany together.The Cabinet agreed:To approve the suggestion of the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs that he should send for the German Ambassador that veryevening and indicate to him the suggestionset forth on pages 3 and 4.      In doing so he should be careful to make clear thatthis was our own spontaneous suggestion and that it had not been discussed in Paris.He should also ask that if Herr Hitleradopted the suggestion at all, he should do it well.
TH3 NEXT 2.     After the Secretary of State for ForeignMEETING- OFTHE CABINET.       Affairs had informed the Cabinet that M. Flandinwould be arriving in London late that evening,the Cabinet agreed:That a further meeting of the cabinet should be held on the morrow, Thursday,12th March, at 11.0 a.m.2, Y/hi tehal 1 Gardens, S. W, 1. ,11th March, 1936.
