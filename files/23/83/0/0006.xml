The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that during his visit at the time of theLate King&apos;s Funeral, M* Flandin h d informed him of the French intention to ratify the pact with soviet Russia and had asked for his views.     He had declined to express any opinion.      He had now receiveda message from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Pariswhich indicated the probability that the french ambassador would call to consult him as to thedesirability of French ratification.      If so, he proposed to express no opinion.       We had not been consulted before the signature of the pact andthere appeared no reason why we should express any opinion now although, unfortunately, it might beimpossible for us to remain outside the consequences of the pact.In the course of a short discussion itwas suggested that it would be a distinct advantage to be able to tell Germany that we had had nothing to do with the matter.The Cabinet approved the lineproposed by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs as summarised above.- 53 r*

The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary covering a Memorandum by the Chiefs ofStaff (CP. 35 (36)).     The Memorandum contained the information for which the Cabinet had askedat their last Meeting regarding the value ofHelouan as a station for British troops.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that as requested by the Cabinet he had asked the British High Commissioner in Egypt to say what he had meant by stage &quot;C&quot; in his telegramNool25 (Foreign Office telegram No.80).        Sir miles lampson had replied that &quot;C&quot; in his telegram No.126was meant to be Helouan (or some other equallycentral or technically suitable point) as ourminimum, if we leave Helmieh and Abbassia plus, ofcourse, the Suez Ganal and Alexandria, or the nearneighbourhood, The Foreign Office thought that sir Miles Lampson was rather optimistic if he thoughthe could secure this minimum.-The Secretary of State for War, in thecourse of discussion read a telegram received by theChief of the Imperial General Staff from General Dillwho believed that there would be a reasonably good chance of obtaining the dispositions we desire(i.e.  stage &quot;A&quot;) if we could create an atmosphere ofconfidence at the outset of negotiations and lead the Egyptians to believe that our object was toco-operate with their Army in the defence of thecountry and not to maintain a stranglehold on   the potential hostile Egyptian Army.       General Dill&apos;view was that there were greater risks in reservationsimplying lack of confidence in the Egyptian Armythan in giving up our grip on such things asmunitions.d$   *-*
that, whilst he did not wish in any way tofetter the discretion of the High Commissionerthe latter should he asked to send home a Q J[warning if he found in the course of u *negotiations that he was likely to have tocome to agreement on the lines of Stage &quot;G&quot;.
The Secretary of State for War also informed the Cabinet (with reference to paragraph (4) of theReport of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee CP. 35(56))that the War Office had. received a telegram to the effectthat Helouan was a healthy station though the militaryauthorities at Cairo disliked it on the same grounds asthe Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, namely, that it wascut off by Cairo from Alexandria er the Suez Canal.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat he proposed,  in instructions to Sir Miles Lampson, touse the same phrase as in the later telegram, No. 136,viz:&quot;Helouan (or some other equally central andtechnically suitable point)&quot;After considerable discussion the Cabinet agreed:(a) that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should authorise the British HighCommissioner in Egypt to negotiate onthe basis of stages &quot;A&quot;,  &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; asset forth in his telegram No,125 of 8thFebruary, with stage &quot;A&quot; as the maximumand stage &quot;C&quot; as the minimum.    The SecretaryOf State should inform Sir Miles Lampsonthat the Cabinet were not enthusiasticabout stage &quot;C&quot;,more especially as once we had committed ourselves to that course it would be difficult ever to withdraw from it and that they would like to be warned,  if possible, when the stage was approaching when the High commissioner would wish to fall back on that minimum,,At the same time the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should make it quite clearthat, whilst he did not wish in any way tofetter the discretion of the High Commissioner,the latter should be asked to send home a O/lwarning if he found in the course of ^negotiations that he was likely to have tocome to agreement on the lines of Stage &quot;C&quot;.&quot;&apos;   (b) that as a make-weight in the negotiations the High Commissioner should be allowed to agreeto an increase in &quot;the strength of theEgyptian Army;

The Cabinet had before them the followingdocumentsj-A Memorandum by the President of the Boardof Trade (CP. 31 (36)) proposing that theExport Credits Guarantee Department shouldbe informed that they were free to considercredits for Russia in the same way as forother countries, subject to treasury approval, and that the 18 months limit nolonger applied.      The object was that theExport Credits machinery should be used tosecure for this country orders for capital goods to the amount of about  1,000,000, ofwhich the Russian Trade Representative had given indications, and which he hao&apos; saidwould be followed by further orders.      ThePresident preferred this method of financeto guaranteeing a long-term loan to theSoviet Government, in particular because some provision against loss in the event ofdefault was part of the Export Creditsmachinery.A Memorandum, by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs (CP. 32 (36)) stating thathe was prepared to postpone discussion ofa loan for Russia and to agree to thepresident&apos;s proposal.      At the same time,he wished the Cabinet to take its decision in the light of the following considerations.(a) that Russia was likely to give usa better bargain in return for a loan.;(b) that a loan, on which he believedthat Russia could be induced topay something higher than thecommercial rate of interest, wasthe last means open to HisMajesty&apos;s Government of fulfillingtheir pledges by obtaining satis-faction for the British creditorsof Russia.After the President of the Board of Tradeand the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs hadedpresent/their . views on the lines of theirLorftrespective memoranda the/Chancellor pointed out thatthe subject under consideration was not that of whether to finance the Russian Soviet Government, but how to finance it.       This appeared at the present time bothwrong and foolishi    wrong, because the aims of SovietRussia were what they always had been, namely, to upset
Q Q0 6the present system of civilisationi    foolish, because themoney was to be spent on re-equipping Russian railwaysand this was likely to annoy both Japan and Germany.      It wasmust unwise to do this at the time when we were most anxiousto be friends with Japan and to avoid any provocation to aGermany already highly suspicious of the Franco-soviet treaty.        He did not wish, however, to revive oldcontroversies and he presumed that the step now proposed was involved in the decision taken 2 years before.The question was also raised as to whether theRussian Soviet Government could not be induced to stop the propaganda of the Third International and the despatchof money for that purpose to this country, of whichexamples were given.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said hehad already spoken sharply to the Soviet Ambassador on thissubject.The Cabinet agreed?(a) that the President of the Board ofTrade should have authority to informthe E:-port Credits Guarantee department that they were free to considercredits for Russia in the same way as for other countries, subject to treasury approval and that the eighteen months limit no longerapplied;(b) that the President of the Board ofTrade should look into the question ofthe faring   Balances and at theappropriate stage discuss the matter with the Chancellor of the Exchequer;(c) to take note that the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs was preparedto postpone the discussion of a loan for Russia and to agree to the above conclusions.
$POSEDkpCASTS BYI BRITISH$adgasting)RPORATION-fpus onffuISM ANDpreviousReference %jatinet 47 (35) ,inclusion 6.)F.R.18. The Cabinet had. before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. 29 (36)),in which it was stated that the B.B.C. had intended that a series of broadcasts on Fascism and Communismshould take place last year, but had agreed to postpone them in view of the imminence of the GeneralElection.      Nevertheless, in spite of representations by the Foreign Office, the B.B.C. had declined todelete these items permanently from the programme ontheir own initiative.      They had offered, however, todo so if they were authorised to state that &quot;they hadbeen given to understand that the broadcasting ofthese talks would be an embarrassment to the Government1&apos;or something similar.      The Secretary of State saw nohope of inducing the B.B.C. not to mention theGovernment&apos;s intervention, and his proposal was that,if the B.B.C. insisted on their procedure, he should secure the deletion of the phrase &quot;would be an embarrassment to the Government&quot; and the substitution of &quot;would not be in the national interest&quot;.The Cabinet realised that care would have toallowingbe taken   in /the British Broadcasting Corporationwho had announced a certain programme, now tomake an announcement that they were not going to beallowed to carry it out because the Government saidthat these programmes &quot;would not be in the national interest&quot;,      although if the matter could not bearranged otherwise,  it might be necessary to adoptthat course.      The course which commended itself tothe Cabinet was that the Postmaster-General should see the Chairman and Members of the Board of theBritish Broadcasting Corporation rather than theDirector and point out to them the objections tothe broadcasts on Fascism and Communism.      He should- 11 -
suggest that this particular scheme required a gooddeal more consideration than had been given to it atpresent:    that if the British Broadcasting Corporationwas to undertake the political education of the   people-eit mjist be done dn carefully considered lines and notin the crude and ineffective form now proposed.      he might, for example, point out the absurdity of askingMr, Morrison to reply on the subject of Communismsince he would merely use it as an opportunity tostate his own political programme.      He might refer tothe recent litigation in which Sir Oswald Mosleyhad been engaged and point to the impossibility inthe circumstances of allowing him to give a broadcast on Fascism.      This argument would be strengthened bythe fact that Fascism and Communism were, so to speak,bracketed together in the British broadcasting corporation^ proposal.      He should, however, lay theutmost stress on the dangers of the proposed broadcastsfrom the point of view of foreign policy, as set forth in CP, 29 (36).      That was a line which, it was thought,the Directors of the British Broadcasting corporation would find it difficult to resist.The Cabinet agreed:(a) That the Prime Minister should see thePostmaster-General and ask him to discussthe matter with the Chairman andDirectors of the British broadcasting corporation on the above lines, andauthorise him to try and induce the directors to withdraw the talks bySir Oswald Moslsy   and Mr. Pollittwithout mentioning the Government inthe withdrawal.      The Postmaster-General,however, should be authorised, ifnecessary,  to make quite clear that theGovernment would not permit the broadcasts.(b) That the Minister of Health, as a formerPostmaster-General, should also discussthe matter with the Postmaster-general who had not been present at the Cabinet.

The Bill would be highly controversial, and an expression of theGovernment&apos;s opinion would be expected.      The minister proposed to oppose the Bill -oainly on the ground thata case has not been established for this revolutionarychange, and further, that a change of this magnitudeshould not in any event be applied to a single area,and is not therefore appropriate to local legislation.The Cabinet authorised the Minister ofHealth to oppose the Bill, and asked him as far as possible to keep off the merits of the Bill and to oppose iton the grounds of the reaction it wouldhave elsewhere.

THE MINISTRYOP DEFENCE(CREATION)BILL.[Previous&quot;Reference:Cabinet 21 (32)Conclusion 4).12.   The Cabinet had before them the Ministry ofDefence (Creation) Bill to be introduced by a private member of Parliament on Friday, February 14th.The Prime Minister said he had ascertained that the Opposition would not oppose the withdrawalof the Bill and did not want a vote.      He had asked the Minister without Portfolio to speak in this debate on behalf of the Government.The Minister without Portfolio said that theBill itself was quite easily riddled on the groundthat it set up an executive Ministry that could not possibly function effectively in time of war.      Inghe Debate, however, the Bill had to be regardedrather as a preface to the controversy that was tobe raised later in the Session and it was not enoughto riddle the Bill.      The alternative forms of organisation were either, one, a Ministry of Defence,or, two, the Committee of Imperial Defence.      he proposed to say that the Government had decided onthe latter system which they regarded as better&quot;even for the purpose of setting up other Ministries,if required, in time of war.      He thought, however,that he ought to make quite clear in the debate that adherence to the Committee of ImperialDefence system did not mean that the existing organisation was not capable of being strengthened.In fact, he could be as sympathetic as possibletowards proposals of that kind without committing himself.The suggestion was made that the systemcontemplated in the Bill was as open to criticismasfrom the point of view of peace as irell/war.    Now-a-days, it was far too much for one man to try anddireet all three Services.- IS -
The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the general line proposedby the Minister without Portfolio.He was asked to make clear that theBill was totally unacceptable,  andshould say that the Government couldnot give up the Committee of ImperialDefence system.(b) That it was too early to say whetherthe Committee of Imperial Defence requiredre-organisation.    (See also conclusion    above),(c) That the Minister without Portfoliowould be well advised to speak at theend of the Debate.- 17 -

THE IRISHFREE STATE.The new &quot;coal-cattle&quot; arrange-raent.14. The president of the Board of trade reported an arrangement which had just &quot;been concluded with the Irish Free State.The &quot;coal-cattle&quot; arrangement with theIrish Free State fell to he reviewed at the endof 1935.     Agreement has now been reachedcontinuing the arrangement with some extension.The exchange of coal for cattle on a   for  basis is to continue.      The United Kingdom will retain a monopoly of the Irish Free State market for coal and our exports of coal to the Irish FreeState in 1936 should be some 400*000 to 500,000tons greater than in 1935, or approximately3 million tons in all.      The Irish Free StateGovernment have removed the duty of %/- a ton on united Kingdom coal and have told us that the taxwill not be reimposed.To balance this increase in our exports ofcoal, the allocation of fat cattle for 1936 will beincreased to 40,000 head more than that for 1935...Secondly, it hat been agreed to reducecertain duties on both sides.      The estimated net cost to the revenue is  650,000 per annum - a figure well within what the Chancellor&apos; of theExchequer agreed to give up in return for &quot;valuereceived&quot;.      Further, the Free State Government haveagreed to reduce by one-half the existing special duties on United Kingdom goods (now 20 per cent,ad valorem) and to refrain from influencing importersagainst the purchases of United Kingdom goods.     Hecould no.t say how- great an increase in our exporttrade will result, but roughly, the effect of theaction taken against United Kingdom trade by theFree State Government in recent years has been to
q qdivert about  2 millions worth of trade to foreigncountries (apart from coal).     There is good reasonto hope that the present proposals will lead toour recovering a substantial part of this lost trade.The Free State are particularly anxious thatthe removal of administrative discrimination shouldnot be mentioned publicly - it is obviously a delicatequestion, but the president of the Board of Tradewas satisfied with the assurance we had received.Finally, we have agreed to an increaseof 10 per cent, in the Free State quota for baconin return for the Free State making arrangements to reserve for the United Kingdom a third of their imports of cement, practically the whole of whichhave come from foreign countries in recent years.This subsidiary arrangement should lead to anincrease of mutual trade of a bout  150,000 a year.It has been agreed that no public statement should be made until its form has been agreed.The President of the Board of Trade wasespecially grateful to the Chancellor of theExchequer for the concessions he had made in revenue(in return for trade) and to the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries without whose whole-hearted-operation agreement could not have been reached.The Prime Minister congratulated thePresident of the Board of Trade and other ministers concerned on this very satisfactory arrangement.
Tile Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries was asked as to the effect of this agreement on british agriculture.      He replied that one of his reasons foraccepting the arrangement was that he was anxious tomaintain the live cattle trade in general and thathe did not like the present concentration of all meatsupplies in the Port of London.      Consequently, helooked favourably on an increase in the Irish cattle quotaall the more since the Irish Free State was cut 50 percent, as a means of holding the market until other arrange-ments could be made.      This increase, he was advised,would not take place until the second half of the presentyear.       The Irish quota might not be filled, since theyhad not filled it completely last year.        In the negotia-tions for the schedules for the second half year he hadthe President of the Board of Trade&apos;s assurance thatIrish Free State supplies would be taken into account./the he attached much importance to getting/moral supportof the Irish Free State to stop smuggling.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries was asked to consider carefully the nature of the publicityarrangements in order to give clear explanations tothe agricultural community and as far as possible toremove their objections in advance.

The Secretary of State for the colonies informed the Cabinet that Lord Elibank had put down a Motion for-Debate in the House of Lords on thesubject of German Colonies which was inconvenientand ill-timed.       He had explained the circumstances and asked Lord Elibank to withdraw the Motion.He was now confronted with various questions in theHouse of Commons, to one of which he proposed to reply as follows:&quot;No Sir:    His Majesty&apos;s Government has not considered, and is not considering, the handing over of any of the british colonies or Territories under Mandate&quot;.He pointed out that this did not bind the Governmentfor the future.The Cabinet approved the above answer.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.7.1. ,12th February, 1936.
