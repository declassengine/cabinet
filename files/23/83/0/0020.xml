The Locarno&quot;treaty.German re-occupationof demilitarised zone. -The presentsituation.[previous reference:Cabinet 19 (36)Conclusion 1).situation had been kept under continuous observationby a small group of Ministers.      Events had movedhadrapidly, however, and he/thought it as well to summonthe Cabinet in order that his colleagues might bekept fully informed.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that the negotiations so far had passed through three phases;(l) A preliminary phase orior to thepronosals of the Belgian Prime Ministers(S) A second stage in which the BelgianPrime Minister had developed his views:and (3) A third stage subsequent to that event.In the first stage each chief delegate had stated his position. The French adopted the -same attitude as in Paris, namely, that internationallaw must be vindicated by a German withdrawal fromthe demilitarised zone before negotiations took place.The Belgians had thought that withdrawal from the demilitarised zone was rather too much toask of the Germans and had taken up a more moderateposition, though if &quot;that were refused by the Germansthey proposed to go through to the end with the locarno procedure.Our own attitude had been governed by thedesire to utilise Herr Hitler&apos;s offers in order toobtain a permanent settlement.       As M. Van Zeelandoccupied the middle position he had been asked toput his views in writing. His proposals,whichhad been circulated to the Cabinet,had been discussed at two meetings but no longer held the field.     Atthe second discussion M. Paul Boncour had been present
fresh from Paris, and had expressed astonishmentat how far the Powers had drifted away from theFrench attitude. M. flandin had then been askedto circulate a paper. After consulting Paris,and some of his colleagues, M. flandin reported withthatregard to M. Van Zeeland&apos;s proposals/they were nota basis for discussion by the French Government.The French Government had then been asked to make their own proposals, especially so far as security for France and Belgium was concerned.       That wasthe position on Saturday. M. Flandin had then asked if British Ministers would produce their proposals. This request had been refused at themoment but   he Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and his colleagues had formulated somesuggestions which he circulated later to the cabinet for consideration.        (See Conclusion 2).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said thathe had met M. Flandin on the previous day and had had a frank talk with him of an hour and one-halfsduration. He had already reported the matter to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs andto the Prime Minister., M. Flandin at firstoutlined the situation in France. Apparentlyhis own position and that of the French Governmentwas very difficult with an election in prospect.    he anticipated a combination between M. Tardieu (whowas supposed to have retired from politics and to bewriting books) the Croix de Feu and theRoyalists and other disgruntled parties of the Rightwho united in criticising Parliamentary methods and threatened action on fascist lines. M. Flandinwas also much concerned at the European situation.
*j u jBy her action in the Shineland and the unilateraltearing up of treaties Germany had gone far to destroy confidence in international treaties.      Unlessinternational law was vindicated he apprehendedthat among the smaller nations there would be asauve-qui-peut and some of them were likely to runto Germany. Therefore he regarded a vindicationof international law as essential. M. Flandinhad thought he saw progress in some quarters heretowards that attitude but he realised that theBritish nation could not agree to put sanctions on germany as they had agreed in the case of   Italy.M. Flandin was quite clear that France did not wantwar,  but only that international law should bevindicated. He had made a suggestion that the locarno Powers should close their ports to german shipping and stop all financial accommodation toGermany. He realised that the League as a wholecould not be counted on to co-operate in this.    Hethought, however, that if the Locarno Powers would do so the situation would be such that Germany wouldhave to give way.The Chancellor of the Exchequer himselfdid not take that view and had suggested anotherpossibility. He recalled that in a conversationwith Herr Hitler, Mr. Ward Price had made a sugges-antion that /international force    should be introduced into the demilitarised zone,as had happened in thecase of the Saar. It would have to be stationedon both sides of the frontier. He had put that proposal to M.  Flandin and it had been extremelywell-received. M. Flandin had thought it would help France and be regarded as an action for the
upholding of international law.     The Chancellor of theExchequer himself hdd suggested that there should be equal numbers stationed on both sides of the frontier, though inthe aggregate it would only be a small symbolic forceand not sufficient to stop   an  invader. M. Plandinhad said that he could not formally accept the proposals but he was 90% sure that his Government would accept it.The next step after an international occupation,the Chancellor of the Exchequer had suggested was that the locarno Powers should then meet.M. flandin, referring to the permanent terms ofthe settlement, had asked about fortifications.The Chancellor of the Exchequer replied that to prohibit the erection of fortifications in the Rhinelandwould be very difficult as Herr Hitler was extremelydotender about his right to/anything that others were allowed to do.M. flandin had replied that the French fortifications-tions were incomplete; that the Belgian fortificationswere not regarded by the French as satisfactory;  and thatconsequently the French were extending their fortifications-tions towards the Channel.The Chancellor of the Exchequer replied thatif the French and Belgian fortifications were so incompletecompletionthat their/could be held up, that might be an assistance.The next question raised had been that ofadditional security to France and Belgium owing to theGerman occupation of the Rhineland.M. Flandin had asked what the British Governmentwould think of the proposal that had been discussed ata meeting of the Locarno Powers for a pact of mutual assistance ?
The Chancellor of the Exchequer repliedthat he did not think that Herr Hitler would enterany such pact as it was known he did not believe in multi-lateral pacts and preferred bi-lateralarrangements. But if there were to be a truce for twenty-five years and a non-aggression pact Herr Hitler could hardly object to theconclusion of the security pacts. In fathe had said so to the British Ambassador inBerlin.The Chanoellor of the Exchequer had then commented on the fact that M. Flandinthingwanted some/more specific in the way ofassurances from this country. That, he had pointed out, would present a difficulty.       Therewas a powerful school of thought in this country that disliked mutual pacts and would like to escape even f?om existing pacts.     He had assured M. Flandin, however, that if he liked toput forward proposals they would be carefully considered.M. Flandin replied that on suchlines solutions might be found acceptable to theFrench Government.The result of this conversation,therefore, v/as a suggestion for a truce duringwhich an international force, largely British in character, would be stationed on both sides ofthe frontier.. There would be no objectionto .a stipulation that neither Germany nor Francenor Belgium should maintain troops adjacent to.thefrontier.       There would be no fortificationduring negotiations.
After these arrangements had beenmade       . further discussions would take place fora permanent settlement on the basis of non-aggression pactsJ    no increase in fortifications;pacts of mutual assistance between France, belgium and Great Britain, which would be open to Germanyto join, if she so desired; the above pacts to bemore strict and more closely defined.        In addition,the pacts should offer the same guarantees to us as to the other nations.In addition to the above the Chancellorof the Exchequer said that M. Flandin had asked what the British Government would do if Germanycame back to the League of Nations and demandedcolonies:    also what Sir Samuel Hoare had meant byhis reference to raw materials at Geneva ?As regards the second point, the Chancellorof the Exchequer had replied that Sir Samuel Hoarehad felt that the question of colonies was goingto be raised soon by Germany and had thereforeanticipated this by raising the question in theleast objectionable form. The British Governmentrealised quite well that Germany&apos;s real object wasnot raw materials but the return of colonies.M. Flandin had then asked what we should do if the question of colonies was raised.The Chancellor of the Exchequer repliedthat the Cabinet had not yet discussed the matter.Personally, however, he thought that if we were insight of an all-round settlement the BritishtoGovernment ought/consider the question.
M. Flandin      . then asked whether there could be an exchange of letters between the twocountries undertaking not to discuss colonies with the &apos;Germans without consultation ?The Chancellor of the Exchequer himself had replied that the two countries ought to discuss thematter, but he did not like the idea of an exchange of letters,which had somewhat surprised M.  Flandin whohad thought it would be interpreted as meaning thatwe did not intend to give up any colony. So far asFrench colonies were concerned he was prepared toconsider the question,       but he feared lest by-embarking on conversations first we might&quot;queer hispitch&quot;,M. Flandin had then asked if the BritishGovernment could state a maximum point beyond whichthey could not go:    e.g. that the Germans must consentnot to construct fortifications In the demilitarised zone.The Chancellor of the Exchequer had given himno encouragement on this line.M. Flandin had then expressed his strong desire for a united policy between the two countries.The President of the Board of Trade said hdhad spoken to M. Flandin for two hours on the previous evening.      For the most cart his conversation had been general, but he had been much concerned with his own internal situation in France.       He had said thatthere were many Communists in France and that the franco-Soviet pact had had a good effect among them,changing some of them into Nationalists.       He had been much concerned about his political opponents and thought that the sooner he returned to France to make contact, the better.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said thatM. Flandin had already decided to go to Paris not later than Wednesday.The Prime Minister said that the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer had informed him of the ahove on theprevious evening. He himself had discussed with someof his colleagues a little earlier the proposal to sendBritish troops to form part of an international forcein the Rhineland.       He himself was strongly in favourof this pronosal. He had anticipated that it wouldnot arise at the moment but he congratulated theChancellor of the Exchequer   on seizing the opportunitythat had offered and in mentioning it.     He thought itwould strike the imagination of Europe and british soldiers would almost certainly fulfil a very valuablerole, making friends with all whom they meet.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs fullyagreed with the Prime Minister in thanking the Chancellorof the Exchequer.The idea of using an international force during a truce made a strong appeal to the Cabinet, who agreed:(a) That the question should be examined at once by the Chiefs of Staff Committee,who should be asked to report on themilitary aspects of the proposal as soonas possible as it would probably benecessary for the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to refer to it in his conversations with French Ministers onthe following day:(b) That the Prime Minister should considerwhether in the light of the Report ofthe Chiefs of Staff Committee, or anyother Committee,  it was necessary for him to summon a further meeting of theCabinet.
2.    The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairshanded round, a Memorandum entitled&quot;Germany and the locarno Treaty&quot; (CP. 79 (36)) in which, after recording the main facts of the present situation, he proposedthat the future structure of security in western europe should he in two parts;    first, non-aggression pactsbetween Germany, France and Belgium and perhaps Hollandwhich would he guaranteed by Great Britain and Italy;second, a superstructure consisting of a pact for mutual assistance between Great Britain, France andBelgium which would be open to Germany.     Appended to theMemorandum were practical proposals under the heading&quot;Suggested Procedure&quot;.The Prime Minister enjoined on his colleagues the great secrecy of the Memorandum handed round by theSecretary of State and the discussion thereon, and asked that his colleagues should exercise the utmost reticenceon the subject in conversation even with their personalstaffs.    (See Conclusion (a) below).After discussion the suggested procedure paragraphby paragraph,  the Cabinet agreed:(a) That owing to its secrecy the Memorandumby the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (CP. 79 (36)) should be handedback to the Secretary of State at the endof the discussion.(N.B.    The copies were handed back with twoor three exceptions in the case ofMinisters who had special reason to study the proposals.      A copy is available on the standard file of theCabinet Conclusions in the custody ofthe Secretary to the Cabinet).(b) To approve the proposals headed &quot;SuggestedProcedure&quot; attached to CP. 79 (36) subjectto certain drafting alterations which were mainly designed to render them easier of acceptance by the German Government, andsubject to the following amendment to replaceparagraph 4 (iii) -&quot;the framing of pacts of mutual assistanceto reinforce the security of the parties concerned.&quot;- 9 -
t* JL w(N.B.    The object of the latteralteration was to get rid of theidea of &quot;compensation to france  and Belgium&quot; by additional commitments at our expense, and topermit reciprocity by which weshould benefit as much as&apos; theother powers concerned).(c) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be authorised, if he thoughtadvisable, to communicate the suggestedprocedure, as amended above, to the french ministers in the course of conversation onthe following day when M. Flandin would bepresenting his own proposals.      It should bemade clear that we should have to insist on some quid pro quo in the form of mutual assistance to ourselves.(For discussion relating to theDominions, see following Conclusion).10 -
tsRMANY ANDIflS LOCARNOffj?treaty.Mxe position if thePreviousleference:$alDinet 19 (36)Conclusion 1).3.      In the course of the discussions referred toin the two preceding Conclusions, the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs referred to the attitudeof the Dominions with whom he was keeping in close touch.      The Dominions had always been critics of the locarno Treaty on the ground that it involved amilitary commitment on the United Kingdom which was notshared by the Dominions.      Consequently, if the commitment matured,a very awkward situation would arise and probably several of the Dominions would stand out.The only way he could see to surmount this difficultyin any mutual guarantee treaty to replace Locarnowas by bringing in all the members of the League whichwould enable the Dominions to come in with the others.It was pointed out that this proposal wouldenormously extend our commitment as it would bring in nations like Russia who would want to be guaranteedagainst Japan.The Prime Minister expressed much sympathy withthe position of the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs.      He wondered whether if the Dominionscoald be better instructed on the historical aspectsof our attitude towards the Low Countries and theactualities of the present situation,  it might be easier to secure their agreement.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs said that he had kept them well informed of all aspects of the situation.      He did not think it wouldbe possible to get them to accept any commitments.He would not press his proposal for extending the commitment to cover the whole League, but he emphasised that it was extremely important asnegotiations proceeded to bear the position of theDominions in mind.        The representatives of the
Dominions in London did not agree at all with theFrench attitude.     He hoped, therefore, that under any new arrangement we should not he committed to action unless an actual invasion of French or Belgian territory took place.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that this would be the case.The Chancellor of the Exchequer expressed thehope that the French view was understood by theDominions.      Up to now they had never contemplated warbut merely that if all the Locarno Powers, other than Germany, stood together Herr Hitler would have to give way.      His own objection to the French plan had beenthat even if it were adopted it could not produce asettlement.

The Foreign Office took the view thatthe German word &quot;alshald&quot; had been correctlytranslated.As regards the first of the German conditions,namely, that their representative would be on a footing of equality at the Council meeting, he saw no particular difficulty.      As regards the secondcondition, however, namely, negotiations in regardto the German proposals, complications would arisesince the German proposals did not affect theCouncil of the League of Nations but only a few ofthe Members including, more particularly, the locarno powers, Austria and Czechoslovakia.      This made itrather difficult for the League as a whole to acceptthe condition.The suggestion was mace that the reply tocondition 2 might be that the League was not in aposition to comment on it because at the moment the Council was only considering the German occupationof the Demilitarised Zone.There was some discussion at this point onthe desirability of getting some contact with theGermans as soon as possible either by the presence ofa    Gorman representative in London, or possibly alittle later by sending a special British representative to Berlin.The Lord President of the Council left atthis point.

The First Lord of the Admiralty reportedthat he was in sight of concluding a Three PowerTreaty between France, the United States and ourselves.      He wanted to get it signed as-soonflu, UuXtfd flatfa Urtu.as possible because/?fa-s getting restive.We ourselves, however, before signing had wanted to be certain that Germany would sign.      The French,however, had not been willing to envisage a Germansignature.      Consequently, he was trying to obtainbi-lateral treaties with other countries, namely,Germany and Russia.     Germany was being helpful inthe negotiations.      He understood, however,  thatthe Foreign Office felt some doubts as to whether in present conditions negotiations ought to go on with Germany.      That appeared to him/wrong view.The negotiations had throughout been kept very quietand had attracted little public interest.     &quot;wewithhad negotiated/the Italians even while we wereapplying sanctions.    It appeared a mistake to adopta different course with Germany, and he did notthink this would help the main negotiations withGermany.      He thought on the whole that it would havea calming effect if it became known that the naval treaty negotiations with Germany were continuing.The Naval Conference had survived many shocks,    andit would be a great pity if it were stopped by this.There was no question of signing until the Germansignature was obtained.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said he did not mind the continuance of negotiationsbut he thought that the present moment would be abad time for signing a Treaty with Germany.

The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsySSINIANTUATION. in reply to a cuestion, said that the italian ambassador had indicated a strong desire to try andev,iousference: liquidate the position as regards sanctions on Italy,oinet 15 (35)conclusion 1).      The latest news from Abyssinia indicated that theP   situation resulting from the Italian victories wasnot so bad as the Italians made out.The First Lord of the Admiralty warned theCabinet that the only ships in Europe capable ofdealing with the German pocket battleships were the battle-cruisers &quot;Hood&quot;, &quot;Renown&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot;.The latter was at home in dock, and unless the twoformer were withdrawn from the Mediterranean, our shipping would be exposed to the German pocket battle-ships in any emergency.       Even if some of HisMajesty&apos; s ships were to be withdrawn from theMediterranean, it would be possible to hold the twoends of the Mediterranean with a sufficient forcewithout home waters being depleted so seriously.The Secretary of State for Air emphasised that with so many aircraft and airmen in Egypt theair position at home was deplorable.      It would bedifficult to imagine a worse situation so far as theAir Force was concerned if an emergency should arise.The Secretary of State for war reported thatthe position was as bad so far as the Army was concerned.      If in addition to the&apos; Forces in Egypt aBritish Force was to form part of an international force on the Rhine, the position would-be worse than ever.A suggestion was made that if no oil sanctionwas to be imposed, some of the Imperial Defence forces might be withdrawn from the Mediterranean.
The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that the question would probablybe discussed by the Committee of Thirteen during thepresent meetings of the League in London.Whitehall Gardens, S.W,1.,16th March, 1956.- 18 -
Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1936.SECRET. Copy No,     37CP. 79 (36).CABINET.GERMANY AND THE LOCARNO TREATY.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.M. FLANDIN in the course of his last conversation at the meeting of the locarno Powers invited His Majesty&apos;s Government to produce at our next meeting some statement of our policy and procedure which might form a basisof discussion. We resisted this appeal, and maintained that we would prefer to study M. Flandin&apos;s views before putting forward our own.At the same time it is clearly desirable, if only for the purpose of clearingour own mind, that we prepare some statement of our own views. For thispurpose I circulate the attached paper to my colleagues.In connection with paragraph 4 (iii), M. van Zeeland had formulated certain proposals (see Foreign Office despatch to Brussels No. 149 of the 14th March).They were as follows :-(a) Automatic functioning of the action of the guarantors in the agreementsreplacing the Locarno Treaties;(b) Agreement regarding the establishment of contacts between the General Staffs to lay down the technical conditions in which the obligationsundertaken in the Pacts would eventually be brought into effect;   .(c) Increase of the material precautions laid down in the multilateralPacts.In my view the future structure of security in Western Europe should bein two parts : First, non-aggression pacts between Germany and France andBelgium, and perhaps Holland, which would be guaranteed by Great Britainand Italy. Second, a superstructure consisting of a pact of mutual assistance between Great Britain, France and Belgium, which would be open to Germany.It must be anticipated that France and Belgium will desire that this pact of mutual assistance should approach, as near as possible to what the Belgian PrimeMinister describes as &apos;&apos; automatic functioning.&quot; In any event, it is certain that both these Governments will ask that the pact of mutual assistance shall includeagreement on the establishment of contacts between the General Staffs of the signatory Powers.A. E.Foreign Office, March 15, 1936.[12911]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT     ^ *
Suggested Procedure.(A) Finding by the Council, under Article 4 (2) of Locarno, that a breach of Article 43 of the Treaty of Versailles has been committed and notification-ofthe finding to the Locarno Powers.(B) Resolution by the Council on the following lines : 1. Condemnation of Germany&apos;s action on following lines (Belgian draft) : &quot; The Council of the League of Nations decides (1) That the scrupulous respect for all treaty obligations is a funda-mental principle of international life and an essential condition of themaintenance of peace;(2) That it is an essential principle of the law of nations that no Powercan liberate itself from the engagements of a treaty nor modify the stipula-tions thereof unless with the consent of the other contracting Parties;(3) That the breach of Article 43 of the Treaty of Versailles and theunilateral repudiation of the Treaties of Locarno by the German Governmentis in contradiction with these principles;(4) That by this unilateral action the German Government confers uponitself no legal rights;(5) That this unilateral action, by introducing a new disturbing elementinto the international situation, must necessarily appear to be a threat to european security.2. Invitation to France and Germany to refer to either the Permanent Courtof International Justice or the Permanent Court of Arbitration the question ofthe compatibility of the Franco-Soviet Pact with Locarno, and any other matters which it might be thought proper so to refer.(N.B. The Belgian proposal was to refer &quot; the German complaints &quot; tothe Franco-German Conciliation Commission provided for under Locarno.-   The question whether the reference should be to conciliation or to one of theabove Courts depends on the matters which it might be decided to deal within this way.)3. Arrangements to be laid down by the Council for the period pending and during negotiations proposed under 4.(a) Reaffirmation of Locarno by the signatory Powers other than Germany.The following draft has been suggested :  &apos;&apos; Nothing which has happened before or since the said breachhas absolved the signatories under the Treaty of Locarno from any oftheir obligations or guarantees, which remain in their entirety until a new convention is concluded.&quot;(&amp;) Stationing of an International Force, including British troops, on either side of the frontiers between France and Germany and betweenBelgium and Germany.(c) In view of the despatch of the International Force, recommendation toGermany, France and Belgium to suspend immediately all despatchof troops or war material into the frontier zones* of the three countries, not to construct any new fortifications in those areas, and to suspend work on existing fortifications.4. The Council takes note of the German proposals 2 to 7 and invites thefive Locarno Powers to negotiate on basis of :  (i) These German proposals so far as they concern the five Locarno Powers,(ii) Revision of the status of the Rhineland on the basis of equality of rightsof neighbouring States,(iii) Compensation to. France and Belgium for the diminution of security which the revision of the status of the Rhineland in the sense indicated above would represent for them.March 15, 1936.* Extent of these zones to be specified ultimately.
