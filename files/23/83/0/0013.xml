gpENCE 1.      The Cabinet had before them a revised draftSQUIREMENTS:of the White Paper which had been prepared since the morning meeting by the Chancellor of the Exchequerrogrammes0f the Defence   and the Secretary of State for Home AffairsServices.(CP. 62 (36) Revise).As at the morning meeting the draft WhiteThe white paper. Paper was discussed paragraph by paragraph and a fewamendments were introduced.(previous The principal discussion arose in connectionReference:Cabinet with the last paragraph and it was suggested that the12 (36)).House of Co iiions would insist on more precision beingffl.73^3f)      given as to the approximate cost of the programmes-The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained the difficulties and objections to attempting to makea forecast in view of the uncertainties of thesituation. He recalled that the Report of theDefence Policy and Requirements Committee took theoriginal estimates for 1935-36 ( 124 million) as thedatum line.       The original estimates for 1936-37to be published during the present week provided for atotal of  158 million, but this included not only theair expansion decided on last year but also therestoration of cuts in pay, the Italo-abyssinian dispute and various other items which had nothing todo with the present proposals of the Government.      Itwas therefore not possible to say that the increases of  50 million and  88 million showed in the defence policy and Requirements Committee&apos;s Report for thenext two years are increases resulting from theproposals in the White Paper. It was dangerous tostate any figures and the political disadvantage of theGovernment tying itself to precise figures might welloutweigh the advantages of refusing to give them.   He
would prefer to reserve the question of how much,if anything, he might  say on the subject until the debate.The reference to an expenditure &quot;rising to a peak and then falling again&quot; was cut out ofthe final paragraphsSubject to the amendments made during themeeting the Cabinet agreed:To approve the White Paper forimmediate issue.
9 ADEFENCEREQUIREMENTSprogrammes ofthe defence services.The forth-comingf parliamentary debate. .2.In the course of the discussion on the previous item the Cabinet agreed:That in the forthcoming debate in the House of Commons itwould be important to mention that the plan of defence requirements must he carriedout without restrictionson the programme of social services and that the maintenanceof the general industry andtrade of the country must he maintained;    indeed it was anessential element in the financing of the reconditioningof the Services.
3.      The Cabinet discussed the arrangementsfor the issue of the White Paper.The Parliamentary Secretary to theTreasury, who attended for this discussion,reported that the only official undertaking wasthat of the Prime Minister to publish the white paper on Tuesday, March 3rd.       He himself had told the Leaders of the Opposition that theCabinet were doing their very best to publish theWhite Paper on the morning of that day andto send advance copies to the Party Leaders onthat very night (Monday, March 2nd).        Thedifficulty of the Opposition Parties was that theyapprehended that they would not have sufficient time to study the document.      Week-ends were not of much use to them as many of their supporterswent away to great distances.        It was necessarytherefore, for purposes of consultation for themto have the paper for study during the middleof the week.        If they only receive the document on Wednesday morning it would only leave ThursdayLeadersand Friday.        To his knowledge the Labour Party/had summoned a meeting of the Trades Union congress general Council for Tuesday, March 3rd at 10 a.m.A little later, after leaving the Cabinet for a few minutes for further enquiry, he reported that inaddition Mr. Attlee had summoned a meeting of his party Leaders at 12 noon on March 3rd.       Mr.Attlee would be content if he could receive acopy In his room at the House of Commons by 9 a.m.on Tuesday, March 3rd.In the discussion the inconveniencewas pointed out of an early morning publication ofthe White Paper as it would then be published
for the first time in the evening papers inLondon and the Provinces and this would hardlyleave time to give any guidance to those papers.After some discussion the cabinet agreed:(a) That the White Paper should beavailable in the Vote Office on tuesday, March 3rd at 10 a.m*(b) That advance copies should be sentto the Party Leaders in theirrespective rooms at the House ofCommons at 9 a*m* on the same day.(c) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should see representatives of thePress on the same day at   12 noon.2, Whitehall Gardens, g.W.I.,2nd March,  1936.
