I NEXTIfSETlNG-OP THEJ CABINET.PA1*     The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that a meeting of the Cabinet would be held onThursday, March 5th at 5.30 p.m.  in the Prime MinisterTsRoom, at the House of Commons, to receive a Reportfrom the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs   onhis proceedings at Geneva.The Home Secretary said he might be engaged on the Bench as there was a Home Office Debate on thedate arranged and the President of the Board of Tradeand the Secretary of State for Scotland reported thatthey would be in Scotland with the King.Originally the Prime Minister said5 p,m. but he has since received a message from Geneva asking that itmight be held at 5.30.
*v I jTHE 2*      In view of the fact that the King wouldREGULARWEEKLY be holding a Levee on Wednesday, 18th March, theCABINETOP 18th Prime Minister arranged that the regular weeklyMARCH.meeting of the Cabinet that day should be held inthe Prime Minister1s Room,at the House of Commons,at 5*30 p.m.
9 1 liANGLO-EGYPTIAN        3.      The Cabinet took note of a MemorandumTREATYNEGOTIATIONS. by the Secretary of State for War (CP. 64 (36))covering notes prepared by Major-General Dill,containing his personal impressions following(Previous his recent visit to Egypt.reference cabinet 8(36)Conclusion 2).
4,      The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. 66 (36))covering a Memorandum prepared in the Foreign Office,in which it was suggested that the proposal previouslyadopted by the Cabinet, namely, that the protection of foreigners in Egypt should be secured by means of an exchange of notes, attached to the Treaty, should bere considered,     It was submitted that this was likelyto prove a less adequate safeguard than an article inthe Treaty itself, in terms taken from the draft Treatyof 1930j-&quot;His Britannic Majesty recognises thatthe responsibility for the lives and property of foreigners in Egypt devolvesexclusively upon the Egyptian Govern-ment, who will ensure the fulfilment oftheir obligations in this respect the Egyptians would find it difficult to reject thiswording, having agreed to it in 1930, and the articlewould create a contractual engagement towards HisMajesty&apos;s Government.If the present suggestion was approved, theinstructions to Sir Miles Lampson would require revisionin this particular.Objections were raised to the above wardingon the ground that it did not impose on the egyptian government any obligation to call in our assistancein the event of disorder which they themselves were unable to control and it did not specifically debarthem from calling in some other nation*inFor example,/a case where Italian subjects were ill-and used by an Egyptian mob/the Egyptian-police or military authorities were unable to restore order,there was nothing in Article 3 which would eitherenable our forces to act on their own initiative or
compel the Egyptian Government to call them in orGovernmentprevent the Italian/ from sending their own forces.    Onthe other hand it was recognised that as suggested inthe memorandum circulated by the Secretary of State forWar it was very important that we should say or do nothing that will imply that we regard the Egyptians aspotentially hostile or that gives the impression thatwe wish to interfere with internal affairs.One suggestion was that the two proposals shouldbe combined, that is to say, that article 3 should beincluded in the Treaty as proposed by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs but that in addition thereshould be an exchange of notes as contemplated in th&amp;Memorandum by the Chairman of the Committee of ImperialDefence.   (CP. 25 (36)).An alternative suggestion, which met with muchsupport, was that Article 5 should appear in the treaty in the form proposed by the Secretary of State for&quot;Foreign Affairs, but that elsewhere in the Treaty .itrequiring outside aid should be made clear that in any emergency/the egyptian government would apply for the use of the forces of theUnited Kingdom and of no other nation and that this limitation should not be confined to the case of external aggression.The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State forForeign Affairs explained that such a clause would bein any eventprovided/so far as external aggression was concerned, butthat, unless confined to external aggression,it was difficult to draft it without arousing the suspicions ofthe Egyptian Government,      Importance was attached by theCabinet to making some provision in the Treaty to meet thepoint.
The Cabinet agreed:That the Parliamentary Under Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs should draft a paragraph on the subject inthe light of the discussion forconsideration at the meeting of theCabinet to be held on Thursday,March 5th, at 5.30 p.m.-5a-\

!8B LICENSINGjMBNDMENT)ILL.previous reference jcabinet 22 (34)Conclusion 10.)I2a &apos;ij- 1 i10*   The Cabinet had before them the Licensing(Amendment) Bill, to be introduced by a private member on Friday, 6th March, together with aMemorandum by the Home Secretary (CP. 63 (36)).The Bill was drafted to &quot;standardize&quot;, and toincrease, the permitted hours in licensed premises and clubs?    and also to provide a system offurther control of the registration of clubs.The Home Secretary proposed that the Home OfficeSpokesman on the Second Reading should have authority to state that it is intended next yearto introduce a Bill to deal with the problem ofbogus clubs5    and that as to the other recommenda-tions of the Royal Commission on Licensing, forexample, on the question of permitted hours,which affect licensed premises and clubs alike,it is the intention of the Government to examine these recommendations and see whether acceptableproposals could be put forward.      If this statement were made the Home Office Spokesmanmight with some chance of success discourage theHouse from proceeding further with the Bill.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed:That the Home Office Spokesman shouldmake the following principal points:(l) That the subject covered by theBill was so wide in scope that itcould not be dealt with by a PrivateMemberTs Bill.(2) That so far as the Bill touchesbogus clubs this was a point ofgreat importance on which the RoyalCommission on Licensing had beenunanimous and that it was intendednext year to introduce a Bill todeal with this matter.    He mightmention that among other matters the Government&apos;s Bill would provide that the Manager of a Club must bea respectable person and premisesmust be suitable for the purposesof a Club. The Home Office
Spokesman, however, should avoid any suggestion that Clubs would haveto register themselves annually*(3) That the Bill tended to mix up agood many different questions;    heshould recall that there had beena very important licensing reportby a Royal Commission a few yearsago; that at the moment he could not hold out any prospect of extensivelegislation, but that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would concentrate for thepresent on bogus Clubs*Whitehall Gardens, S.        1,,4th March,  1936.
