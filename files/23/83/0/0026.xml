The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairshanded round a revised draft letter to he addressedto the French and Belgian Governments in replacement of the draft in the White Paper (Cmd. 5134).He explained that the principal differences betweenthe new draft and the original were in the first line (consequential on the withdrawal of Italy and thedelay) and the substitution of the word &quot;Proposals&quot;for &quot;arrangement&quot; in the introductory paragraphas well as in paragraph 1 (d).After discussion the Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the revised draft lettersubject to the substitution in line 5of the words &quot;arrangement thereproposed&quot; for the words &quot;said Proposals&quot;,and the substitution in paragraph 1 (d)of the word &quot;arrangement&quot; for &quot;Proposals&quot;.(NOTE:     A copy of the revised draftsubmitted by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairsshowing the alterations made,is attached in Appendix I).(b) That the above letter should not bepublished immediately in case the Frenchand Belgian Governments should objectto the alterations made in theoriginal draft.(NOTE:      See also Conclusion 2 inregard to the covering letterto the French and BelgianAmbassadors).(c) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs in seeing the Press that evening,should be authorised to inform themthat the letter was to be dispatchedvery shortly, and that the Staff conver-sations would be begun as soon as theAgenda had been agreed upon between theGovernments concerned.      He should explain that the above action was beingtaken in pursuance of the arrangementsmade on March 19th;    that tfche effort of conciliation had not failed;    andthat the German proposals were being examined.
overing Lettero the Frenchnd Belgianoassadors.FX3.    The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs read the draft of a covering letter which he proposed to send to the French and BelgianAmbassadors.One difficulty which confronted the&apos;Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theCabinet arose out of the receipt of the German peace plan at the very moment when we had been about to give effect to Section III of Cmd. 5134and to send the attached letter.        It wasnecessary to avoid giving the Germans an impression that this latter action was our replyto their new proposals.      The Secretary of State&apos;draft letter was designed in part to remove this impression.There was general agreement that the rightlogical order was as follows:(i) To show that the steps we were takingwere in accordance with the proposalsdrawn up on March 19th;(ii) That the delivery of the letter didnot betoken that the effort of conciliation had failed;    and(iii) That the new German proposals had only just arrived and were receivingattention.This would show the French and Belgians that wewere complying with the proposals of March 19thand that we did not regard the effort of conciliation as over, while letting the Germansknow that our action was not a reply to their proposals.The Cabinet agreed:To approve the covering letter tothe French and Belgian Ambassadorssubject to any detailed alterations
that the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs might deem necessary or advisable.    (e.g* He informed theCabinet that instead of promising the conversations &quot;forthwith&quot; he proposedto state &quot;as soon as the Agenda for the conversations has been agreed upon between the Governments concerned&quot;).(NOTE:    A copy of the covering letter as actually sent isattached in Appendix II.)
GERMANY ANDTHE locarno treaty.The German peace Plan.(previous reference:Cabinet 25 (36)Conclusion 2).4.      Between the meeting held on the same morning and the meeting here referred to the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs had circulated to theCabinet an uncorrected copy of Despatch No.400to Berlin recording a conversation with Herr vonRibhentrop at 10 a.m. the same day and covering the German government&apos;s memorandum of April 1st.1936.   (CP. 100 (56)).The German memorandum was discussed in a preliminary manner, mainly from the point of viewof the guidance to he given to the Press, whoserepresentatives the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs was to see almost immediately after theCabinet meeting.The Press, it was pointed out, would wishto know how the German memorandum affected themeeting which the British Government was known to betrying to arrange.It .was suggested that the general line of reply to such a question would be to the effectthat the document presented considerable difficulties:    that the German occupation of thaRhineland,  involving a breach of the Treaty of locarno, had shattered the confidence of Europe:that what we wanted first was to obtain some actionoS a re-assuring character by Germany to restore confidence in some degree:    that the German memorandumpurported to be an answer to the joint communicationby the United Kingdom, France and Belgium set forth in the White Paper (Cmd.  5134/1936):    that thememorandum did not meet the suggestions in that joint
communication in any way:    but that how far thiswas compensated for by the Gferman proposals, someof which were interesting,  it is hard to say,more particularly as there had been little timefor studying them and no opportunity for consulting the French and Belgian Governments who had been associated with us in the proposals set forth inthe White Paper.It was pointed out that on the one hand the French Government must not be given any encouragement by the attitude of the British press to reject the proposals altogether and that on theother hand the British Press must not be encouraged to adopt too sanguine a view of the German proposalsoVarious suggestions were made forcommentaries on details of the German proposals^It was pointed out, for example, that the historical passages on pages 3 and 4 were inaccurateand provocative;    that the Germans criticised theInternational Court at the Hague on the groundthat it was capable only of judging the legalre-aspect of the German/occupation of the Rhineland,and incapable of judging the political aspects,but that they did not say whether the international court of Arbitration, which they themselves proposed,,would be capable of judging political aspects:    andin particular on page 7 the German remarks on thebetweenprbposed immediate cbuyers .itions /. the General Staffs were heavily criticised.       Generally, alsothe German memorandum was criticised on the groundthat it proceeded on the assumption that the presentsituation was satisfactory and did not take intoaccount the shock to the public opinion of Europecaused by their own breach of the Locarno Treaty &apos;,- 6 -
to which the French and Belgians attach somuch importance.      In effect, it con-tained a negative answer to all theproposals made by the British, french and belgian Governments.
5*     The Lord President of the Council informed the Cabinet that he had seen The King and that HisMajesty had agreed to the Coronation being heldin May, 1937, which opened the way for furtherconsideration of details.       He had received agood many representations of different kinds asto the actual dateoThe Secretary of State for DominionAffairs reported that all the Dominions had agreed to the month of May.The Cabinet agreed:That the Lord President of theCouncil should summon the CabinetCommittee to meet.1w2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.,1st April, 1936.CORONATION,(previous reference:Cabinet 24(36)Conclusion 6),

His Majesty&apos;s Government propose that the conversations between the General Staffs of the two countries, necessaryfor establishing the contacts in question, should be begun in London as soon as the agenda for those conversationshas been agreed upon.I am addressing a similar letter to the BelgianFrenchAmbassador.
