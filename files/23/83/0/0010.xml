NAVY.A replacement programme including7 capital ships and 4 aircraft carriers(some of a smaller type).      Completemodernisation of 3 capital ships andpartial modernisation of 4 capital ships.The increase of the Fie et Air Arm to 504aircraft.       An expansion of Naval personnelby some 35,600.A replacement programme of 5 cruisersa year is submitted, but it is recommendedthat this programme should only be adoptedsubject to later review. Further increasesmay be required if a new standard of naval defence is adopted.ARMY.The Regular Field Force.It is recommended that this should include4 infantry divisions and 1 (mechanised) mobiledivision, together with other components, andthat the rate of mobilisation should be accelerated in order to make possible thedisembarkation of this Force on the Continentwithin a fortnight.The Territorial Army.-The modernisation of 12 territorial divisions, as proposed by the Official Committee,to be postponed for later decision.    A public statement, however, to be made that any territorial Field Force which is sent abroadwill serve in its own units and formations, andnot as drafts for the Regular Army.-Coast Defences.An extended programme for the modernisation of coast defences at home and abroad.The Cabinet had before them a Report by the ministerial Sub-Committee on Defence Policy and requirements (CP. 26 (36)), in which it was recommended that, in view of the altered international situation, important and extensive measures should betaken during the next 3 to 5 years to modernise our national defences.      The Report of the (Official)Defence Requirements Committee (D.R.C. 37) was attached.Among the numerous recommendations of the ministerial Sub-Committee were the following:-
I JOAir Defence of Great Britain.Completion of the existing progranme.Field Artillery.Re-equipment with an 18-pounder gun re-lined to take a 25-pound shell (in place ofthe existing 18-pounders and 4.5 inch howitzers).The converted gun to be regarded as the first&quot;mark&quot; of a new gun, which would take the sameammunition.Infantry.An increase of 4 battalions for overseasgarrisons.AIR.Completion, as already approved, of themetropolitan first line strength to 123squadrons (1,512 aircraft), subject to re-consideration in the event of further increases in the German Air Force.Further squadrons for Army Co-operation withthe Regular Field Force and with the TerritorialArmy.INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION.The overtaking of deficiencies and thebuilding up of an adequate &quot;war potential&quot; onthe following principles;-No interference with production for civil or export trade;    a part of the &quot;shadow&quot;munitions industry to be brought into operation-,since the requirements of the next 3 to 5 years will exceed the capacity of the State factories and the &quot;professional&quot; armament firms;    measuresto be taken to insure the collaboration ofindustry and the prevention of profiteering;rapid decisions to be secured where Treasuryauthority is necessary.COST AND FINANCE.The cost of the Official Committee&apos;scheme, as modified and endorsed by the ministerial Committee, is very tentativelyestimated at  394,500,000 in the next 5 years.--This figure is the estimated excess over thenormal expenditure of the Defence Services,which is assumed to c ontinue at the level ofthe original Estimates for 1935.The Cabinet had also before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Air (CP. 2V (56)) statingduui**z flu  cho&amp;*v fwxod. t^t /** mythat it was now possible/to organise a much more effective air striking force than had been approved
last year.      The light bombers wouldbe useful for training purposes and for service overseas, but for the purposes of a striking forceit was proposed^to replace them by medium bombers.In addition, it v/as proposed to increase the aircraft establishment of certain squadrons.      The striking force would then number 1,022 aircraft, of which eventhe lightest - the smaller medium bombers - would include the whole of western Germany in their normal range.      These changes were estimated to cost 12,500,000 capital and  2,000,000 a year for maintenance, etc.The Cabinet also had before tham a Memorandumby the Minister of Labour (CP. 57 (3.6)) stating thata preliminary examination had shown that the supplyof labour for the purposes of the defence programmeswas likely to constitute a grave problem.Lord Weir had spoken of 120,000 additional menas being required, and it would be necessary to analyse these into skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled.Again, as regards the first of these classes, it wasnecessary to consider separately the engineering,ship-building, building,  and iron and steel trades.It was possible that a position might arise in whichskilled labour would have to be rationed between thevarious supply services,  on the one hand, and theexport and general trade of the country on the other.He was preparing a more considered Memorandum, whichhe hoped would be referred to the appropriateMinisterial Committee.
The Cabinet discussed the Report of the ministerial committee on Defense Policy and Requirements    (CP. 26(36))paragraph by paragraph and agreed:(a)    To approve the Report generally and pro-visionally on the understanding that the programmes contained therein were liable tQmodification in the light of newconsiderations such as the developments inthe range and offensive power of aircraftreported in the Secretary of State for Air&apos;sMemorandum CP.  27 (36) and any other new factors that may arise and subject also tothe conclusions which follow.Paragraphs 8 and 9.    That nothing should besaid in the White Paper as to the possibilityof the adoption in the near future of a new standard of naval strength, more especially as approval for the proposed standard has been reserved until the Admiralty have made afurther report,   as provided in these paragraphs.(c) Paragraph 10.  Capital ships.    &quot;While theprogramme of 2:3:2 capital ships was approved provisionally for the years 1937-39it was agreed that these figures should notappear .  in the White paper which should onlymention the laying down of two capital ships in 1936.The subject of battleships versus bombsis one that it will probably be necessary to investigate when effect has been- given tothe proposed changes in Defence Co-Ordination.&apos;For purposes of Parliamentary Debate itwas essential to make clear that intensiveexperiments on this subject are in progress and will be continued.It might be pointed out also that in thisevolving problem unless it could, be saiddefinitely that attacks by aircraft would be fatal to capital ships it is impossible for usto scrap or not to build        capital shipsso long as other nations have them.(d) Paragraph 10. Aircraft carriers.    That theeffect on naval warfare,  especially in the narrow seas, of the very recent developments in the range and power of aircraft referredto in the memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Air (CP. 27 (36)), should receive early consideration, but that in the meantime theproposals for the construction of four newcarriers (some of a smaller type) within theperiod 1936-42 should provisionally be approved.It would be advisable to limit the reference in the White Paper to. the numbers of aircraft,carriers to the one small carried to beincluded in the 1936 programme.(&amp;)
list(e) Paragraph 11.    To accept the recommendation that the cruiser replacement programme(five ships) should be adopted onlyprovisionally and subject to later review.(f) Section V.  Army Programme and Requirements.That the approval given to the Army Programme, and Requirements, like the remainder of ther.k. ^5(3^?,        Report, is provisional and liable to review in the light of changing circumstances andpossibly later decisions as to the priority in which the requirements of the severalServices are to be provided in view...   ..&apos;of the international situation and other factors.(s)    Paragraph 171   Line 1.    That the words&quot;If our assistance to Continental Allies isto be effective&quot; should be amended (e.g.by erratum) to read &quot;If our assistancerequired abroad is to be effective&quot;.(h) Paragraph 21. That in approving the sixthrecommendation referring to the territorial force, the Cabinet should take note thattys if,contrary to expectation,it should befound possible to make a start with theTerritorial Force side of re-equipmentbefore the end of three years there wouldbe no objection to a re-opening of thequestion with a view to a fresh decision.(i) Paragraph 25. That the appropriate Sub-Committee of the Committee of ImperialDefence should look into the question of whether Takoradi might not be substituted -with advantage for Sierra Leone as thedefended port in West Africa. &quot;(j)    Paragraph 25.  To take note that a message had been received from the JapaneseGovernment to the effect that they wouldlike to renew Article XIX of theWashington Treaty and that if this were accepted by the other powers concernedadditional expense in the defences of HongKong beyond that provided for in thereuorts before the Cabinet should be avoided.(k)   While provisional approval was given to paragraph 24 note was taken of a statement by the Secretary of State for Air that areport was likely to be received by theAir Defence Research Sub-Committee whichmight involve considerable alterations in the scheme of Air Defence of GreatBritain.NOTE;    The Lord President of the Councilasked, that he might be kept in touch with the above report and the proceedings of the air defence Research Sub-Committeethereon.
(l)   Paragraph 25,  line 5.      Twenty-two battalionsshould be twenty-one battalions.(m)    Paragraph 28.  Improvement in Housing.The Cabinet took note that the War office would be able to spend seven and one-half million pounds in the next five years and wished to have this put on record.The Secretary of State for War said he had instructed the Quartermaster-general to place himself in touch with the Ministryof Labour on the labour aspects of thisquestion on which some difficulty was anticipated, especially in Scotland.Air Porce Programme and Requirements.In giving their provisional approval to section VI    (CP. 26 (36)) the cabinet also gave similar approval to theMemorandum by the Secretary of State forAir on the Air Striking P-orce (CP. 27(36)).The Secretary of State for Air pointed outthat the total proposals involved an addition of 182 aeroplanes to the figureof 1512 for first-line strength.( 0)    Industrial Production.In giving provisional approval to SectionVII the Cabinet took note that the Ministerof Labour would have a number of points to raise on the subject of industrial production at the appropriate time,  as mentioned in CP. 57 (36).(p)    Paragraph 37* Attention was drawn to thedesirability of exercising great discretion in the White Paper in any reference toLord Weir.(q)   Paragraph 42* Note was taken of a warningby the Minister of Labour that some of the firms might approach the Government for a subsidy for training purposes, but thisought to be rejected.        The trainingschemes of the Ministry of Labour could provide semi-skilled but not skilled labour.        There was agreement that anygeneral conference with labour would notbe advantageous and should be avoided, ifpossible.(r)    In giving provisional approval to paragraph43 dealing with the collaboration -ofindustry and the prevention of profiteeringthe Cabinet gave similar approval to annex D.(.s)    On the subject of sub-contracting attention was drawn -So the following statement madeby the Prime Minister in the House ofCommons the previous day:&quot;The measures that have been taken,so far,  in the limited expansion which
has been made, I believe tobe satisfactory.    The house will have the opportunity, onthe pertinent Estimates, ofdebating that matter.    Wehave, as the House is aware -and they will be told moredetails presently - a very greatproblem,  in which we desire theco-operation of the whole House,in expansion, that will haveto be met in the next four or five years and,  as we go on tomeet those conditions, one ofour greatest problems will beto consider whether such measures as we have taken hithertowill be sufficient.    If we think they are not sufficient, weshall certainly suggest others.&quot;The whole subject of prevention ofprofiteering,  especially as regards sub-contractors, was recognised to be verydifficult.(t) En giving provisional approval to paragraph43 note was taken that sub-paragraph (h)only gave a very small recognition to thepart that the Ministry of Labour would haveto play in the programme.(u) Paragraph 50, line 2.        The word &quot;that&quot; isa mis-print for &quot;than&quot;. -(v) Secret Service.    In approving paragraph 51 thehope was expressed that no mention of thiswould be made in the White Paper.(w) Section IX.  Cost and Finance.    The cabinet took note of the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;view that the question of Cost and Financewould have to be hand-led very cautiously inthe White Paper and it would probably be advisable to avoid figures which could beadded up to a larger amount than public opinion was anticipating.(x) Section X. Observations..     The first sentencesuggesting general agreement with the general observations of the Defence requirements committee was not approved.(y) Paragraph 57. The Cabinet aooepted an explanation by the Minister of Labour as tothe relations between Defence Departments andthe Ministry of Labour in the matter of recruiting.       This was a story with a longhistory and big issues behind it.       TheMinistry of Labour were anxious in every wayto assist recruiting,and posters and literatureon the subject to be found in every LabourExchange were handed round to the Cabinet^The big issue, however, was that if unemployed
men got the impression that on enteringa Labour Exchange they were liable to beblack-listed if they refused to become a recruit to the Services the wholeindustrial reason for Labour Exchanges wouldbe under-mined.The Minister of Labour stated thathe was anxious to discuss the whole matter with the Serviee Ministers and would do his best to render every possible assistance.The Minister of Labour also suggestedthat paragraph 57 (b) appeared more appropriate to the Ministry of Health than to the Ministry of Labour which had beensingled out for mention.NOTE;   As a minor point in paragraph57 (a) - &quot;Unemployment Exchanges&quot;should be &quot;Employment Exchanges&quot;.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.,25th February, 1936,
