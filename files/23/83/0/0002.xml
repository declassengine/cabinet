APPOINTMENT 1*     The Lnrd President of the Council beganOP .A COUNCILOF STATUE, by explaining that the Prime Minister, who had gone toan Audience with the King, had asked him to take theI Chair at the Cabinet until his return.     After recallingthe discussions at the Cabinet last year with a view to legislation to provide for the transaction of public business during any illness of the King, he gave hiscolleagues a brief account of the circumstances inwhich the late King had been advised to appoint theCouncil of State.       The Prime Minister and some of hisascertainedcolleagues had/on Sunday, January 19th from Lord Dawsonthat the state of the King&apos;s illness enabled a meetingof the Privy Council to be held for the appointment ofa    Council of State, if this was essential for the transaction of &quot;public business.     While there was greajsthenuncertainty it/appeared possible that the King mightlive for some time but be incapable of signing documents,the accumulation of which might create a difficult situation.       On Monday morning, January    20th, LordDawson was still of opinion that the King.might ^liv-e forsome days.       Consequently a meeting of the Council washeld;    the King started to sign the warrant but could not complete his signature; the Privy Councillors presentwere satisfied that it was the intention of the King tasign and it was only the condition of his arms which prevented him from giving a full signature, and signed a minute to this off* jt immediately after the Council.    Asa matter of fact the Council of State did operate that very same evening when a number of documents were signedbefore the King&apos;s death, after which it lapsed.    (Towardsthe end of this item several Ministers entered the cabinet room including the Lord Chancellor, the Home Secretary,the Secretary of State for Air and the Secretary ofState for Scotland).
HIS MAJESTY&apos;S 2.    The Lord Chancellor informed the message TOPARLIAMENT. Cabinet that the customary arrangement on a new King coming to the Throne wasthat both Houses of Parliament should move the PARLIAMENTARYADDRESS TO HIS       Addresses in response to a Message fromMAJESTY THE KING.the King.       He and the Home Secretsry hadbeen looking at precedents and preparing the PARLIAMENTARY drafts.      First the King had to be advisedMESSAGE TO her majesty. as to the terms of his Message to Parlliamentand secondly drafts of the Address to His majesty and a Message to the Queen had to be prepared.After discussion the Cabinet agreed:The King1s Message to Parliament.(a) That the question of whether the message from the King to the House of commons should be prepared as in 1910 in thethird person or with a. view to strikinga more modern note, in the first person,was so much a personal matter for theKing that the Home Secretary should,submit the point to His Majesty himself,giving him alternative drafts for hismessage:(b) That the draft prepared by the HomeSecretary should be examined immediatelyafter the meeting of the Cabinet bythe following Ministers, the Home Secretary,the Lord Chancellor and the Chancellorof the Exechequer, and that the draft ordrafts approved by them should besubmitted to the King:The Address by the House ofCommons to the King. _^(c) That subject to the addition of the word. &quot;Divine&quot; before &quot;Providence&quot; in the penultimate line the following draft-address prepared by the Lord chancellor should be approved for presentation tothe House of Commons:&quot;That a humble address be presented to His Majesty to convey toHis Majesty the deep sympathy felt by this House in the grievousaffliction which He has sustained bythe death of The Late King, HisMajesty&apos;s Father, of Blessed andGlorious memory:
To assure His Majesty that the example of unselfish public service which our LateSovereign displayed and His untiringendeavours for the welfare of all His people,will ever be held in affectionate and gratefulremembrance:To express to His Majesty our loyaldevotion to His Royal Person and our firmconviction that under the blessing ofProvidence He will, throughout His Reign,promote the happiness and protect theliberties of all His people.&quot;Message ,to Her... Ma. jesty.(d)   That the following draft resolution prepared bythe Lord Chancellor, should be approved for presentation to the House of Commons:&quot;That a message of condolence be sentto Her Majesty tendering to Her the deepsympathy of this House in Her bereavement an$tassuring Her that this House shares Hersorrow in the irreparable loss which thenation has sustained and that all its members will ever hold in their hearts towards H.erMajesty the deepest feelings of reverence andaffection.&quot;
3*     The Cabinet concurred with the HomeSecretary that in modern conditions amnestieson the accession of the Sovereign to prisonersundergoing sentence were an anachronism and thatthe King should not he advised to grant them.

atlantic route.viouserenee.inet 56 (35)elusion 4; .5.  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Air (CP.  14 (36)),  covering the Report of the Mission which visited Canada and theUnited States in November and December,  1955.     TheSecretary of State assured the Cabinet,  in the courseof his Memorandum, that the details of the provisional agreement were in accordance with previous Cabinetdecisionsj    and he asked for authority, in conjunctionwith the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, toobtain the necessary agreement of the DominionGovernments to the proposed plan.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve generally the proposals of theSecretary of State for Air as set forth in his Memorandum CP. 14 (36);(b) To authorise the Secretary of State for air in conjunction with the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs to obtain the necessaryagreement   with the Dominion governments to the proposed plan;(c) That the Secretary of State for Air inconjunction with the Secretary of State forthe Colonies should take any action that wasnecessary to obtain the agreement of theGovernment of Bermuda;(d) That the Secretary of State for Air shouldbe invited to express the Cabinet&apos;sappreciation of the services of therepresentatives of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom who had conducted thesedifficult negotiations with so much skill andsuccess to a successful conclusion and toaddthe Cabinet&apos;s satisfaction with tfcugood team-work displayed.
JT-OF-LIVING)EX NUMBER,jposed inquiry;o workingj.ss expenditure  revision ofjis of.;ritionjuiries.JviousTerence:cabinet 40 (31)lclusion 19).6,   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Minister of Labour (CP.  11 (36)), recommend-ing that an inquiry should be undertaken intoworking class family budgets, and that, on thecompletion of this inquiry, the basis of the officialcost-of-living index figure should be revised.Stress was laid also on the importance of such an inquiry from the point of obtaining better informationthan is at present available on the subject of nutrition and the expenditure thereon of working classfamilies.      Previous discussions with the TradesUnion Congress General Council and the NationalConfederation of Employers&apos;  Organisations would bedesirable.      The Minister asked for authority toproceed with the inquiry, subject to reconsiderationif the discussions mentioned should disclose reasons of substance in favour of postponement.In the course of discussion the suggestion was made that this inquiry was likely to result ina grep.t deal of agitation on the subject of wages.The Chancellor of the Exechequer did not oppose the new inquiry though he doubted whether thecost would end at  20,000 to  25,000 mentioned in theestimate as the fact of this inquiry was likely to lead to a demand for inquiries in other directions.He recalled that the whole matter had been investigated by the Economic Advisory Council in 1930-31 and hesuggested that their report would be the right starting point for the inquiry and that the proposed AdvisoryCommittee to co-operate with the Ministry of Labourmight not be necessary or desirable. The economic advisory Committee had suggested that the inquiry should be confined to men in full work and this Reportcovered the whole ground very well.      As it had been
accepted by the Trades Union Congress General Councilit might avoid many difficulties to start on that basis*The Minister of Labour warned the Cabinetthat the question of how far the information requiredfor nutrition enquiries could be grafted on to theReport of 1931 would need careful consideration.After further discussion the cabinet agreed:(a) That the Minister of Labour inconsultation with other ministers concerned, including the President ofthe Board of Trade, should re-examinethe question in the light of theCabinet discussion and more particularly of the proposal to start on the basisof the Report of the Economic AdvisoryCommittee, and advise the Cabinet j(b) That the Minister of Labour shouldalso circulate to the Cabinet theReport of the Economic AdvisoryCommittee of 1931*- 8 -*
