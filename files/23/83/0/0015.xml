THE locarno treaty.possibledenunciation of by Italy and its effect on theTreaty.The Italo-AbjcssinianDispute.(previous references:Cabinet 3 (36)Conclusion 1and 14 (36)Conclusion 1).1.      The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs gave an account of the procoedings atGeneva from whence he had returned only that afternoon.       The position had been rather different from that envisaged by the cabinet before his departure when they gave him his instructions.       He had found M. Flandin verykeen to make an attempt at conciliation between italy and Abyssinia before taking a decision on oil sanctions.       He, himself, did not feelvery hopeful of the result, but he thought itbest to acquiesce.       At the same time it had become clear from his conversations withrepresentatives of other States that the Leaguemust say something about its intentions on thesubject of sanctions,  otherwise the world at large, and Italy in particular, would assume that the oil sanction was dropped.      In thesechanged circumstances he had decided that itwas unavoidable, notwithstanding the Cabinet&apos;desire that he should try and avoid takingan initiative to announce the policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to support the applicationof an oil sanction if conciliation failed^M. Flandin had appeared very depressed byccmmunisations he had received from Italy tothe effect that, if an oil sanction were imposed Italy would withdraw from the Leagueof Nations, refuse to sign a Naval Treaty anddenounce the military treaty concluded   betweenMarshal Badoglio and General Gamelin.    M. Flandinalso feared that Italy would disinterest herself in the Locarno Treaty.     He was surprisedwhen he learned that we had not receiveda similar message. So far as the
9 9 9*V rO 0prospects of conciliation were concerned the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs said that in favour of the attempt it could be said that Italy was already hitrather severely by sanctions as indeed Signor Grandihad recently admitted;    and Signor Mussolini was obviously making the utmost of the recent victories.As straws in the wind pointing in the same directionliis own remarks on an oil sanction had not been reportedin the Italian press which meant either that theapplication of the sanction was not calculated torally public opinion to Signor Mussolini or elsethat Signor Mussolini wanted conciliation;    and further that there had never been so many Italian journalistsat Geneva before^ Before leaving Geneva he had sentmessages to some of his foreign colleagues who had notbeen present at the Committee of Thirteen asking themto attend the meeting on the Committee&apos;s re-assemblynext week in order to take their share in the responsibilities for the important decisions that hadto be taken. One other interesting fact was thathe, himself, had received a personal manuscript letterfrom Signor Mussolini in his own hand enclosing, horriblephotographs of the barbarous treatment of Italiansoldiers by the Abyssinians.Coming to the subjects on which he wished to consult the Cabinet as set forth in his telegrams from Geneva No.  SI L.N., 22 L.N. and 23 L.N., alldespatched March 3rd and received Maroh 4th, theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs again referredto M. Flandin&apos;s apprehensions, viz:  that an oil embargo would almost certainly involve the departure of Italy from the League as well as in all probability
99her withdrawal from her obligations under theTreaty of Locarno and denunciation of the military agreement concluded within the framework of Locarno.This, together with the possibility of an Italianrapprochement, with Germany and of German action inthe demilitarised zone created a grave situation for Prance and he wished to be re-assured as to theBritish attitude before taking a decision on the oil embargo.        So far as the possible rapprochementbetween Italy and Germany was concerned the ForeignOffice took the view that this was unlikely, partly owing to the Italian need in the maintenance of anindependent Austria, partly because therapprochement would embitter Italy&apos;s relations withJugo-Slavia, partly owing to uncertainty of Italy&apos;future and oartly owing to the well-knownunreliability of Italian policy, of which Herr hitler was well aware.        In this respect French fears were probably exaggerated.Referring to the telegram from GenevaNo6  22 L.N., paragraph 5, the points put Icy M. Flandinin his memorandum could be summed up as follows:1.    The French Government counts on theBritish Government being ready to holdthat the Treaty of Locarno commitsthem vis-a-vis France even in theabsence of the other guarantors.    Thisraised two questions:(i) as to whether if Germanyviolated the demilitarised zone and Italy took no action we wereabsolved.    The Foreign Office view was that the answer to thisquestion was that we were notabsolved because under Article 1of the Treaty of Locarno theguarantee was made&quot;collectively and severally&quot;?(ii) as to whether if Italydenounced the Treaty, we claimed that we were absolved.    To this he
At this point the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs answered a number of questions whichwere put to him, in the course of whioh he stated thateventually if he was satisfied on the questions he had raised and that the policy of conciliation had beentried out, M. Flandin would probably agree to theimposition of an oil sanction. The Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs himself had not felt justifiedin pressing other nations on the subject, but his general impression was that they would also agree.    he explained also that one of the great difficulties indealing with these matters was that every conversation he had with M. Flandin leaked into the French press.He had made representations to M. Flandin on thissubject without getting any satisfaction.       Unfortunatelytherefore it had to be assumed that his reply on thequestions M. Flandin had put would leak into theFrench press.Coming to the procedure that France proposedto adopt if Germany violated the demilitarised zonehe pointed out that:would like to reply that we didnot wish to claim that an Italianrepudiation of Locarno wouldrelease us from our obligations.In this connection the Secretary ofState for Foreign affairs pointed outthat in the original negotiationsfor the Treaty of Locarno we had intended to sign without Italy and itwas well-known to all the signatoriesthat Italian co-operation had been introduced at the last moment.2.    The French Government counts on theUnited Kingdom being ready to supportFrance,even alone,  in the maintenanceof the demilitarised zone.3.    Before tacing a decision on the oil embargo, which might have pepercussionsin the near future which for france would be so immediate and so grave, theFrench Government desire to receiveconfirmation that the BritishGovernment would be in agreement onthese various points.
0 9 hi O i.(a) The French Government would not proceed to isolated action and would only act in agreement with theco-signatories of Locarno whom theywould consult.(b) In case of a flagrant and incontestlbleviolation of Articles 42 or 43 of theTreaty of Versailles the FrenchGovernment would immediately inform theCouncil and would place itself in communication with the United Kingdomand the Belgian and Italian governments with a view to concerting common actionin the execution of the provisions of the Covenant of the League of nations and the Locarno agreements.(c) Pending the receipt of the opinion ofthe above Powers the SJrench Governmentreserved the right to take anypreparatory measures, including measuresof a military character in anticipation of collective action which might bedecided upon by the Council of theLeague and by the guarantors of Locarno.While the French Government were not likely,  in such circumstances, todecree a general mobilisation theywould &quot;probably take certain preparatorydefensive steps on the frontier.In the course of the discussion it wassuggested in present circumstances that Germany was unlikely to commit a &quot;flagrant51 breach of Articles 42or 43 of the Treaty of Versailles which underArticle 2.1. of the Treaty contemplated &quot;an unprovokedact of aggression&quot; and the &quot;assembly of armed forcesin the demilitarised zone&quot; - that is to say a threat of an actual invasion of France. Germany alreadywas understood to have violated the demilitarizedzone to the extent that she had more aerodromes than she was entitled to and more police.       Any violationshe made was more likely to take the form of equippingbarracks and eventually placing garrisons in them which was hardly a flagrant aggression.
999w v wThe Cabinet was reminded, however, that thiswould only postpone the necessity of a reply untilthe CouncilTs decision had been taken on an allegedviolation. Under Article 4.2. of the Treaty of locarno as soon as the Council of the League was satisfied that a violation   or breach had been committed it would notify its finding without delay to the Powers signatory of the Treaty who severallyagreed that in such a case they would each of themcome to the assistance of the Power against whom theact complained of was directed. The Council&apos;decision was only one of fact as to whether there hadbeen a violation or breach and when that was communicated to the Powers the latter had to take their decision. It was further pointed out thatan extraordinary position would be reached inconnection with the Locarno Treaty if Italy decidedto leave the League. In that event Italy wouldprobably cease to send a representative to theCouncil though two years&apos; notice was required for technical cessation of membership:    althoughtechnically Italy would still be represented at theCouncil Table,in fact she probably would not berepresented and would probably decide to disinterestherself in Locarno. In the case of flagrantbreach of Articles 43 or 43 of the Treaty of Versailles,for example, under Article 4.3. the Council of theLeague&quot;will issue its findings, and thehigh contracting parties undertake toact in accordance with the recommendationsof the Council provided that they areconcurred in by all the members other thanthe representatives of the parties whichhave engaged in hostilities&quot;.
Italy, though still remaining a member wouldnot be in a position to concur in these recommendations since she would not be present..The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs pointed out that an abstention did notcountaThe suggestion was made that the7signatories of the Locarno Treaty had nevercontemplated One of the parties running out.It was one thing to say that five peopleentered on an agreement under which they under-took to take certain action collectively andseverally in certain circumstances, but it was rather a different situation if one of the partiesdrew out..
The Cabinet returned several times to thisquestion.      It was pointed out that a not unlikelypossibility was that Germany herself might denounce the Locarno Treaty on the ground that it was invalidatedby the Franco-Russian Treaty.      What, it was asked,would be the effect of this on other signatories?Although it was unlikely to occur, it was possible even to conceive France drawing out of the Treaty.      Wouldother signatories in that event be compelled to come tothe rescue of Belgium alone?A good deal of discussion took place as to whatwas involved in the undertaking under Article 4.3.of the Locarno Treaty that as soon as the Council ofthe League of Nations was satisfied that a violation orbreach had been committed the signatory Powers, on receipt of the Leagues notification, should agree thatthey will each of them &quot;come immediately to the assistanceof the power against whom the act complained ofis directed.&quot;It was further pointed out that in Article 4.3.dealing with a flagrant violation, the contracting partiesundertook &quot;immediately to come to the help of the partyagainst whom such a violation or breach has been directed....&quot;       Was there any difference, it was asked,between the meaning of &quot;assistance&quot; in the former case and &quot;help&quot; in the latter?The cabinet were reminded that in the Frenchversion the word &quot;assistance&quot; was used for both theEnglish &quot;assistance&quot; and &quot;help&quot;.      What then, it was asked, did &quot;help&quot; or &quot;assistance&quot; mean?       Could it betaken to signify only economic pressure, or did itinvolve military assistance?     One suggestion was that
the phrase must be construed in the light of earlierTreaties where it was used and must involve fullmilitary co-operation.      It was true a signatory nightdeclare that it had no military forces available and could only assist,- for example, with air forces or naval forces.      This, however, would involve a fullstate of war.Another suggestion was that the Power &quot;against whom the act complained of is directed&quot; or &quot;against whom such a violation or oreach has been directed&quot;and -who was entitled to assistance would not be treated in conformity with the spirit of the Treaty if thefullest military co-operation was not forthcoming.This raised the question as to whether in theevent of a breach of articles 42 or 43 of the Treaty ofVersailles not involving a flagrant aggression or therisk of immediate invasion, Prance was entitled to claim that she was the Power &quot;against whom the act complained of is directed&quot;.     Might it not be said that the actcomplained of was directed against all the signatories of the Treaty other than the aggressor.      On thatinterpretation it would seem that the proper course was for those Powers to meet and discuss the question.It was asked whether Prance was entitled to theinitiative since the violation would affect all the signatories.      In this connection it was suggestedtnat as Prance and Belgium were the countries nearestto the demilitarised zone, in the event of a violationthatit was probably one of them/would bring the question at once before the Council of the League as provided in Article 4.1. which would give them the initiativefrom the outset as the Powers most affected.
After a good deal of disaussion on the question of legal interpretations, it was decided to refer these   c? uquestions for authoritative advice as to the meaning of theTreaty, as set forth in Conclusion (a) below.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggestedthat the questions requiring legal advice should be asfollows:(i) If Germany takes action which admittedlybrings the guarantees of the Treaty of locarno into operation, and Italy, without having previously announced that she nolonger holds herself bound by her ebliga-tions under that Treaty, disinterestsherself, does that absolve us from theobligation to take action under the Treaty?(ii) If Italy announces that she no longerholds herself bound by her obligations under the Treaty of Locarno, does thatrelease us from our obligations under theTreaty?(iii) Their view   on the course proposed byM. Flandin in the -event of a violation ofthe demilitarised zone, and the nature and extent of our obligations.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the LordChancellor and the Home Secretary were all inclined to takethe view that the answer to (i) at any rate was that wewere not absolved from our obligations.The Home Secretary pointed out that point (ii)could be stated in this way.      There were two buttresses tothe Treaty, we being one and Italy the other buttress.If one buttress was withdrawn, was the second expected tosupport the whole edifice?The Lord President of the Council questioned whetherthe Cabinet would be right to assume that the answer to question (i) was in the affirmative.      He inclined to theview that the whole position would be given away if that were the case.      He urged repeatedly that the diplomaticsituation should be so handled as to avoid our having to answer questions (i) and (ii) which never ought to be put.As the discussion proceeded, this view was developedby the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer andothers who pointed out that the reality of the situation was that neither France nor England was really In a position/to take effective military action- 10 -
against Germany in the event of a violation of theTreaty of Locarno. m. Flandin ought to he put up against this    reality.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs suggested that one way to get round the difficulty was to take up the question of negotiations withGermany.     He himself would like authority at once totake up the question of an Air Pact with Germany.The French -ambassador had urged him to this course.If this were done the question of the demilitarised zonewas almost certain to be raised at an early stage.If the French should be drawn into such negotiations the question might be settled in connection with an .Air Pact.     M. Flandin of course was not in a positionjust before the General Election to raise the questionhimself.     That rendered it all the more desirablethat we should act.The above course -was agreed to.    See Conclusion(b) below.It was pointed out that in affirming the desire of the French Government to receive confirmationthat the British Government v/ould be in agreement on thetwo main points raised in Geneva Telegram No. 22 L.N*,M. Flandin had provided an opportunity to carry out thesuggestion to get the question away from the legal issues and to deal with it in a realistic spirit.The Lord President suggested that the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs should see M. Flandinand discuss the matter frankly as between two responsiblestatesmen, putting the question to him as to whetherFrance was in fact prepared to initiate action in the demilitarised zone.      He might state frankly his belief that.French public opinion would not support such action
29 Qti! and       get him to withdraw his question.      In short,we should avoid being driven back on to the legalissue and keep the road open for diplomatic arrangement.The Prime Minister added that we might thenstate that we were not in a position in a military senseany more than Prance was for action of the kindcontemplated, as M. Flandin himself was well aware.At this point it appeared to some members of theCabinet that the French Governments object    in  juttingthese questions was not so much to secure our active co-operation which they themselves must know was notfeasible in the present state of our public opinion and armaments, but rather to give them an excuse beforeFrench public opinion to avoid acquiescing in an oil embargo on Italy.The Cabinet were reminded that the French for along time had been trying to obtain some assurance from us as to what action we would take in the event of a violation of Locarno.      This was merely an attempt to use the pretext of the oil embargo question to raise theissue again.Towards the end of the discussion opinion began tocrystallise    in the direction of the desirahiLityof diplomatic action on a realistic basis in advanceof a reply on the   legal issues which could in any eventnot be answered before the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs had to return to Geneva.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointedout, however, that M. Flandin wanted an answer to questions (i) and (ii) before he would give a decisionon an oil embargo.      He himself might be able to hold the position for a few days by explaining that the Cabinet1were not yet in a position to give an answer, but hecould not delay indefinitely.
It was suggested that it was quite probablethat Italy would not draw out of her responsibilitiesunder the Treaty of Locarno, in which event it mightbe unnecessary to give an answer to M. Flandin.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs agreed that Italy had never as yet hinted to us thatshe would disinterest herself from the Locarno Treaty,The Lord Chancellor pointed out that M, Flandinhad quite a good case for raising this question.      Wewere asking him to agree to an oil sanction.     He was apprehensive that in that evtnt Italy might tear upon an oil embargothe Treaty of Locarno.     Before deciding,  therefore,he appeared justified in asking what our attitude would be in that event.One suggestion was that while we could not refusean answer covering the immediate future, we might wellbe justified in insisting on reopening the wholequestion.After the Lord President had again repeated his suggestion that the proper course was to avoid answeringthe legal questions by an frank talk with M. Flandinbringing out the realities of the situation -exchequer the Chancellor of the/suggested that the properposition was that If one signatory to the Treaty pulledout the other signatories ought to confer together as to what should be done in the changed situation.The Prime Minister agreed that this was theproper course.      He was apprehensive that if thequestions were answered the Government might be placedin a very difficult situation.      Consequently, he supported the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s suggestion as well as the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs&apos;proposal that we should come to some arrangement withGermany.
The Cabinet agreed:(a) That a Committee composed as follows -The Lord Chancellor (in the Chair),The Home Secretary,The Law Officers of the Crownin consultation with Sir William Malkin,should consider the following questions -(i) If Germany takes action whichadmittedly brings the guarantees ofthe Treaty of Locarno into operation,and Italy, without having previouslyannounced that she no longer holdsherself oound by her obligations under that Treaty, disinterests herself, doesthat absolve us from the obligationto take action under the Treaty?(ii) If Italy announces that she no longerholds herself bound by her obligations under the Treaty of Locarno, does thatrelease us from our obligations underthe Treaty?(iii) Their view on the course proposed bym.  flandin in the event of a violation of the demilitarised zone, and thenature and extent of our obligations.(b) That the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should be authorised immediately to with the German Government theAir Pact.reopenquestion ofan(c) That the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should be authorised to discuss M.  Flandin&apos;ssuggested procedure with reference to the demilitarised zone with the French PrimeMinister in a realistic spirit, as well as tomake clear that if one signatory disinteresteditself from the Locarno Treaty,  the proper course was for the other signatories to confertogether as to what to do in the.changed situation.      This did not imply that we had ceased to value the Treaty of Locarno.
