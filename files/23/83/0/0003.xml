JEE ITALO-IaBYSSINIANllSPUTE.uallissistanbe.I previous inference:Cabinet 2 (36)Conclusion 4)-F.R/5(3 b%1*     The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that Notes had been sent to theChairman of the 6oneir3r3?at^a Committee at Geneva bythe United Kingdom, France, Greece, Turkey, the LittleEntente and Spain reporting the arrangements theyhad made for mutual assistance in the event of an emergencyarising out of the application of sanctions.    All these letters had been satisfactory,  except the one from Spainwhich, though weak, had been better than nothing.One reason for sending these letters was tomeet the German suggestions that the conversations had some bearing on the Locarno Agreement.He proposed to publish these letters as a white Paper for Parliament.The Cabinet agreed to the proposal ofthe Secretary of State.
THE ITALO- 2.     The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsABYSSINIANDISPUTE. reported that no initiative had been taken at Geneva in----- the matter of conciliation either by the United KingdomConciliation.    or France.        The Foreign Office,  as well as the French- -   - - and German Governments had some information to theeffect that Signor Mussolini was more anxious for peaceHe gave the Cabinet some(previous reference cabinet 2 (36) than he had been a month ago.Conclusion 4).information in a contrary sense received from a UnitedStates citizen but this was generally felt not to be of much importance.D
HHE ITAL0IbyssinianJISPUTE.ie proposed.Imbargo onSL1 supplies for Italy.(previous reference:Jfibinet l( 36Conclusion 4)*3.     The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that a meeting of internationalexperts was to take place next week at Geneva to con-sider the effectiveness of an oil sanction.     He thoughtit probable that the.meeting would take a week or cwo.For the moment there was nothing to be done until the experts had reported.The Cabinet agreed.
4.     The Cabinet had before them a very confidentialentitled The German DangerMemorandum/by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (CP, 13 (36)) with which   was circulated acollection of reports from His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Berlin, written between the spring of 1933 and theend of 1935.      The reports covered the whole period during which Herr Hitler has been in power.      Theconclusions which the Secretary of State drew from thesituation thus revealed were, firstly, that it is vital to hasten and complete our own re-armament, and secondly,that (whilst pursuing our re-armament) it will be well to consider whether it is still possible to come tosome modus Vivendi with Germany.      In the presenttemper of the German Government and people this solution would not easily be realised.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlin was due in London the same evening and he hoped to discuss with him the whole question of relations with Germanyvery shortly.The Cabinet were reminded that there was a diplomatic as well as a military side to our relationswith Germany..       A great deal of consideration wasbeing given to the question from the military point ofview but the military situation developed out of the diplomatic situation..       Were our relations with france so tightly bound, it was asked, that we shouldhave trouble if the Cabinet were first to survey thesituation themselves and then consider a policy towards Germany ?The First Lord of the Admiralty reported a conversation he had had with the French Minister of marine who had made clear that France could not evencome into a Naval Treaty with Germany until after the   .
Elections, if&quot; then*The Chancellor of the Exchequer reported a briefconversation with M. Flandin, the new French Foreignwho,Minister,/while not personally opnosed to a policy ofestablishing better relations with Germany, had indicated that nothing could be done at present and that itwas essential to be strong before dealing with Germany.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported a conversation with the Belgian Prime Ministerwhose view was that the balance had shifted from Locarnoto Geneva and that provided the Western Powers were strongthere was not much danger from Germany to the demilitarised zone.      He had indicated the intention that belgium ehodld strengthen her defences.       The real danger was in Eastern Europe, especially if Germany and Japanwere to act in collusion.       M. Van Zeeland thought,however, that Germany could not be approached until afterthe settlement of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsadded that one new factor in the situation was that afterrecent experiences no one thought that France was likelyto move in the matter of collective security except whereher own frontier was in dangeraSome discussion took place on the subject of theeffect on Germany of the ratification of the Francos-soviet treaty, and the Cabinet were informed that the reason given4by M. Flandin for French ratification was that this hadbeen necessary   to anticipate the treaty between Germanyand the Russian Soviet.The Cabinet agree^.:(a)    to take note that the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs intended to circulate a memorandum of his conver-sation with the Belgian,Prime Ministerand to confer with His/MajestyTs
Ambassador in Berlin during his visit to London;(b)     that the question of british policy towards Germany should betaken up as soon as the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs was ready.e also the following conclusion)
5.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. 15 (36))covering the Report of an Interdepartmental Committee,which had been set up as a result of Sir Samuel Roare&apos;sspeech at Geneva on September 11th, 1935.      The Reportpointed out that, broadly speaking, it is perfectlyopen to foreign nationals to exploit the resources ofthe British Colonial Empire.      This fact, however,would not diminish the dissatisfaction of the &quot;starvedPowers&quot;, who were unable at the present time to payworld prices for their raw materials.      Any inquiry bythe League of Nations ought, it was suggested, to aim at separate guarantees of free access in respect ofcertain individual raw materials, whether producedwithin a Colonial territory or not.      These guaranteesmight be coupled,  if this further suggestion was notruled out by probable French objections, with a generalguarantee in respect of all raw materials &quot;produced in colonial territories.Unfortunately,  it was unlikely that limitedproposals on these lines would avail to prevent the&quot;starved powers&quot; from demanding a political redistribution-tion of Colonial possessions.     The Secretary of State&apos;view was that both the existing political situation andthe conclusions of the Report itself made it undesirable to take any action at Geneva at the present time.In the course of a discussion of a preliminary character it was pointed out that the memorandumunder consideration, though invaluable   as a statementof the economic aspects,  showed that the questionof German colonies was essentially political and thatno economic argument was likely to convince theGermans to drop their political demands.
The Cabinet agreed:(a) to accept the view of the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs that it was undesirable to take any action atGeneva on the subject of the report at the present time;(b) to take note of the Report as a valuable contribution towards theforthcoming discussions referred toin the previous conclusion on BritishRelations with Germany.
.TKE IMPORTANCIOF ANGLO-JAPANESEFRIENDSHIP.(previous- Reference;cabinet 49 (35)Conclusion 4.)FXP.R. S6*  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of St^te for War (CP. 12 (35))  covering aNote by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff,  inwhich attention was drawn to the recent occasions onwhich Japanese statesmen and soldiers had hinted thatthey w-ould welcome closer relations with this country.It was recognised by the General Staff that there wereformidable political obstacles in the way, but it was urged that our weak military situation in the Far Eastmade every effort necessary to overcome those obstacles.In the course of a short discussion theFirst Lord of the Admiralty reported that if the delegation of the United States at the Naval conference could be kept up to their promises and the french delegation could be brought to agreement he did notdespair of bringing the Japanese into some kind ofqualitative agreement.        The real danger was lestGermany and Japan should be driven together,.    Alreadythey were interchanging information on Naval matters.If Germany were to move in Eastern Europe there was thedanger that Japan might move in the Far East.     He had given the French a warning that such a move an the partof Japan would be of greater concern to this country with its vast interests in the Far East than Germanaction in Eastern Europe.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that the Foreign Office shared to the full the anxiety of the Chief of the Imperial General staff for good relations with Japan.      It was easier todesire them, however, than to find in current eventsa gedd opportunity for promoting them in the general interests.The Cabinet were reminded that Sir frederick leith Ross had been sent to the Far East for the veryreasons given at the end of paragraph (8) of the
Memorandum by the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff, viz: to convince &quot;Japan of our sinceredesire for friendly co-onerstion, e.g., inChina.....&quot;       Information had been received thatthis distinguished Civil Servant was trusted and likedboth by China and Japan.       He was thought by someto be the only man who might bring off an agreementbetween the two and it was hoped that he would stayfor some time longer, even &quot;though his services, could*with difficulty     be spared from European problems.The question was mentioned as to whetherbetter opportunities could not be found for thediscussion of such questions between the GeneralStaff and the Foreign Office than by bringing them before the Cabinet^The Cabinet took note of CP. 12 (36).
EGYPT.treaty negotiations.(previous reference:Cabinet 1(36)Conclusion 7).7*     The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that in dealing with the question of treaty negotiations in Egypt he had acted on the lines ofthe Cabinet decision referred to in the margiru     Hethought that experience had shown that these were theright lines.       So far the Egyptians had provedunable to form a Government with which we could beexpected to treat.      The British High Commissionerhad reported that in the circumstances it was not ahimselfmatter for us to move and he/ had replied, by concurringin this view.The Cabinet took note of and approved the above statement.-   H
8.    The Cabinet had &quot;before them a Memorandum by theLord Chancellor (C. F. 22 (36)), dealing with theresolution to be moved by Viscount Sankey in theHouse of Lords on February 4th - &quot;That the presentsystem of Trial of Peers by peers has outlived itsusefulness&quot;,,      The Lord Chancellor proposed that thematter should be left to the free discussion of theHouse of Lords, and that if a substantial majority ofthe House is in favour of the motion and if a Bill is introduced to give effect to their resolution, theHouse should be told that the Government will adopt abenevolent attitude with regard to the Bill, and will do its best to find time for its consideration in theHouse of Commons, unless the discussion there is likelyto prove unduly long.The Lord Chancellor made a statement on thelines of his Memorandum.The Lord Privy Seal, as Leader of the Houseof Lords, put forward a different point of view.He did not attach much importance to the inconvenienceto the Peer principally concerned at the late trial,nor to the fact that one hundred Peers had assembledto try a case involving questions, not only of fact,but also of law.     What had actually happened wasthat the iay^ieads had differed and/had agreed toaccept the opinion of the Judges which was what wouldnearly always happen.      The expense of the trial,especially if it occurred only once in thirty-fiveyears, was not material.      Before the recent trialeveryone had said that an absurd situation would arise,but when the event happened, the trial had beendignified and rather popular.      This procedure wentback to medieval times and was just one of the matters
which made this country different from others.He would not dissent from the plan of the House ofLords expressing its opinion, but if the Lord Chencellorwas to present one view, he himself would like to he allowed to state the other point of view and tohave the question left to a free vote.One comment on this was that to continue the oldprocedure would arouse the belief that Peers were beingtried by a more favourable procedure to themselvesthan that available to other accused persons.    Untrueas this probably was, it would strengthen the idea thatPeers have a privileged position.      It was pointedout that many cases might arise out of the applicationof the Motorcar Acts.A suggestion was made that Lord Rankeillour&apos;amendment to abolish the trial by the House of lords of felony but to retain it for treason was a faircompromise.      It was pointed out, however, that a Billto this effect would be very difficult to defend inthe House of Commons *        It was recalled that an act of treason might involve both Peers and Commoners,and it would be extremely awkward if the Peershad [&quot;b U UXtd f^fianalMye4a4me^d^bs^^^ght^t^M^^j^i by the House of Lords.The Lord privy Seal, who was impressed both bythe difficulties of securing the passage of LordRankeillour&apos;s amendment in the House of Commons andby the objections to Members of the Government express-ing different vie-ws in Debate, proposed that the LordChancellor in his speech might give a fair presentation of the arguments on either side, following that by astatement of his own views from the legal aspect.He might then add that there were Members of theGovernment who took different views on this question
and that consequently Members of the Governmentwould not vote.The Lord Chancellor agreed to this procedure which was approved by the Cabinet.
[extension of milk ACT.   1934.(previous Reference s^Cabinet 13 (34),1Conclusion 9.)9.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries/^(c.P. 20 (36))in which it was explained that the various measuresof Exchequer assistance to the milk industry, underthe Milk Act, 1934, would come to an end, partly inMarch, 1936, partly in September, 1936.     For various reasons it was not yet possible to frame a permanentlong-term policy, and the Minister proposed to introduce a short Bill extending the main provisions of the Actuntil 1937.The Cabinet agreed:-(a) To approve the proposal of the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries as setforth in CP. 20 (36) and summarised above,(b) That the date to which the Bill shouldbe extended should be left to the/It f-tUtilxMj c^l $taU\     Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,^j, fccAr-tcu^-d-f I    /the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Minister of Health.
THE education bill AND THEEDUCATIONGOTLAND) BILL,i    --(previous^Reference .&apos;Cabinet 2 (36)Cox&quot;.elusions 7land 3.)10, It had been agreed at the last Meeting of theCabinet %-(a) That the Cabinet Committee on Educationalpolicy should meet as soon as possible toconsider -(i) The points in the draft education bill reserved by the Committee ofHome Affairs for determination bythe Cabinet, and any other points of difficulty that might be raised:;and(ii) Any points of difficulty in theScottish Education Bill which mightbe raised by the Secretary of Statefor Scotland.(b) That a special meeting of the Cabinet toconsider the Report of the Cabinet Committeeon Educational Policy should be held onMonday next, January 27th, at a time to beaiinounced later.In pursuance of this Conclusion, a Meeting of theCabinet Committee had been held on January 23rd.Agreement had been reached at this Meeting and thePrime Minister had decided in consequence to disx^ensewith the intended special meeting of the Cabinet.      TheCabinet Committee had since circulated their Report(CP. 17 (36)).      The Report stated that only threematters appeared to need further consideration!    andon these it was recommendeds-(1) Grant of Employment Certificates during a school Term.The following wording is suggested,  in place of the former provisos    &quot;providedthat the issuing authority when sosatisfied may nevertheless suspendcertificates of employment until theend of the school term&quot;.(2) Crediting of Unemployment InsuranceCont ributions,It will be politically impracticable totake away a privilege granted in 1934,and a statement should accordingly bemade to the effect.that the Scottishposition will be brought into line withthe English position before the raising of the school leaving age comes intooperation in 1939.- 16 -
(3) Medical Treatment in Instructional centres in Scotland.The title of the Education (Scotland)Bill precludes the introduction of any provision.The Home Secretary, on parliamentary,educational and administrative grounds, urged thatit would he preferable to make the continuance of the child at school to the end of term the general rule,and to provide that the issuing authority might makeexceptions in cases justifying them;    but after discussion the proposal in the form recommended bythe Committee was accepted by the Cabinet.On the second proposal the Chancellor of theExchequer stated that he had not been in agreementwith his colleagues in the course proposed, namely,to bring the Scottish position into line with theEnglish position which was more expensive andconsequently a more popular one..The Cabinet agreed:To approve the proposals contained inthe Report of the Cabinet Committee(CP. 17 (36)) as summarised above.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.,29th January, 1936.
