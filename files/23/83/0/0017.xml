2S?THE LOCARNOGerman re-occupation ofthe Rhineland.(previous reference:Cabinet 16(36)Conclusion l).F.R.1*      The Prime Minister reported to theCabinet that owing to the position reached at theother than GermanyParis conversations of the Locarno Powers/theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theLord Privy Seal were returning to London to-day for the purposes of consultation with the Cabinet.The Lpcarno Powers would be arriving on thefollowing day, Thursday, March 12th, and theCouncil- of the League of Nations was to meet inLondon on Saturday, March 14th.Owing to fog the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and the Lord Privy Seal were unableto travel by air and would arrive by train.     Hehad provisionally fixed the time of a special cabinet meeting to be held in his room at the House ofCommons for 6 p0m., but it might be necessary to postpone it if the Ministers&apos;  journey was delayed.He did not prooose to discuss the question of theGerman re-occuuation of the Rhineland that morning.- 1 -
9 fi Q(COO2.     The First Commissioner of Works informed the Cabinet that the most suitable place for the  .meeting of the Council of the League of Nations referredto in the preceding conclusion was St. James&apos;s Palace.A difficulty, however, had arisen owing to the fact thatThe King was holding a levee on Wednesday next, March18th, and it was uncertain how long the meeting ofthe Council would last.There was general agreement that St, JEamesTsPalace was far the most suitable and dignified place for a meeting of the Council of the League of nations and that at a meeting of such great importance everything possible should be done to add to the convenience ofthe Council and the dignity of the proceedings.The First Commissioner of Works was asked toplace himself in immediate communication with the lord chamberlain&apos;s Department with a view to ascertaining the King&apos;s pleasure on the subjectsWithin a few minutes the First Commissioner ofWorks reported that His Majesty had willingly acceded to the proposal that St, James&apos;s Palace should be usedfor a meeting of the Council of the League of nations and had directed that the levee should be held atBuckingham Palace,The Prime Minister expressed the gratificationof his colleagues and himself at The King&apos;s prompt and ready acceptance of their wishes.
iuSGYPTlANm-*TI0NS,itection ofI?1icrners.Iviousgerences sjinet 14I, Con-Ision 3,Cabinet1(56), Con-Ision 2.)c $3.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. 71 (36)),in which it was recalled that, at the previousdiscussions referred to in the margin, the Cabinet had abandoned the proposal to secure the protection of foreigners in 3gypt by means of an exchange of notes,and had decided to deal with the matter instead by anArticle in the Treaty in the terms of Article 3 of the1930 draft.      The Cabinet had thought, in addition,that the Treaty should include elsewhere a provisionmaking it clear that in any emergency requiring outsideaid the Egyptian Government would apply for the use ofthe forces of the United Kingdom and of no other nation,and that this limitation should not be confined to thecase of external aggression.The Secretary of State&apos;s Memorandum indicatedthree methods of giving effect to the Cabinet&apos;s wishes,but of these methods only the third was likely to be acceptable to Egypt.     This method was to add at theend of an Article in the Treaty (in the terms ofArticle 7 of the 1930 draft) a sentence such as thefollowing3-&quot;The high contracting parties would alsoconsult together if circumstances should ariseinvolving the possibility of any interventioninto the internal affairs of Egypt by anythird Power.&quot;The Secretary of State had asked for Sir miles lampson&apos;s views, both generally, and on the specificsuggestion above.      Unless Sir Miles replied that the suggested method had fair prospects of acceptance byEgypt, the Secretary of State hoped that the cabinet would regard as adequate for their purpose   theinclusion of an Article in the terms of Article 3 of1930, without any additional provision.      In any event
he hoped that, should it prove impossible to secure &quot;JvEgyptian agreement to any such additional provision,the Cabinet would authorise Sir Miles Lampson toaccept Article 3 alone,  rather than allow negotiations to break down on this point.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forForeign Affairs reported that the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs would have preferred to stand on article     3 of the Draft Treaty of 1930 and considered thatthis article would put this country in a special position for the reason that the Egyptian Government would make this statement to this country only.In the course of the discussion the LordChancellor expressed some doubt as to whether Article 3of the 1950 Draft Treaty, which began by stating thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government recognised that theresponsibility for the lives and property of foreignersin Egypt devolved exclusively upon the Egyptian Govern-ment, would justify us in intervention in an emergency.He suggested that before relying on that constructionit would be well to consult the Law Officers of theCrown.Another suggestion was that Article 3 of theDraft Treaty of 1930 would give a sufficient appearance of justification to enable us both to warn off other powers and to act ourselves in an emergency, whatevermight be the strict legal interpretation.A third suggestion was that we should begin by trying to induce the Egyptian Government to acceptthe proposed addition to Article 7 and see how theEgyptian Government took it before falling back,possibly on Article 5 of the Draft Treaty of 1930.      the production-nosed, addition to Article V,  it was pointed out,did not, on the face of it,  involve much derogation- 4 -
from Egyptian sovereignty since it provided for consultation between equals.       Moreover,  it could be pointed out to the Egyptians that such consultationmight be very valuable to them in various cases of difficulty which might arise with foreign powers.A fourth suggestion was that the LordChancellor should be asked to consider some alternativewording either to draft Article 3 or to the proposedaddition to Article 7 which would carry out the wishes of the Cabinet with less risk of antagonisingEgyptian opinion.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs urged the importance of notjeopardising the Treaty by insistence on this point.As it transpired that the question was not likely to arise in the negotiations for some timethe Cabinet agreed:To postpone further considerationuntil after the High Commissioner&apos;reply had been received.
IsSES DUB TOINCTIONS.-previous reference sluiriet 11 (36^,conclusion 10.)4.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thepresident of the Board of Trade (CP. 70 (36)),showing the extent of the losses being suffered byBritish trade owing to the application of sanctionsto Italy.      Claims were being received in respect of(i) outstanding debts for goods supplied to Italy,to the estimated amount of about  3,000,000, togetherwith other commercial debts, (ii) injury or destrua-tion inflicted on the trade of British firms, (iii)individuals deprived of their employment.      As regardsthe first class, it was only possible to answer thatit was the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government toraise the question of liquidation with the ItalianGovernment as soon as a favourable opportunity arose.As regards the second and third classes, compensation was impracticable,  if only for the reason that itwould lead to requests for compensation for loss oftrade or employment due to other causes.      It must beanticipated, however, that the pressure on theGovernment to grant compensation would increase the longer sanctions remained in force.The Cabinet took note of the Presidentof the Board of Traders Memorandum,CP.  70 (36).
5.     The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Lord President of the Council (CP. 67 (36)),recommending that preliminary inquiries withregard tc* the date of the Coronation should nowbe started, for which purpose it was suggestedthat a Cabinet Committee might be appointed.    when an approximate date had been settled the regularprocedure would be to hold a &quot;Coronation Council&quot;,at which two Committees of the Privy Council wouldbe appointed - a Coronation Committee to deal withthe general arrangements, and a Court of Claims todetermine the rights of those claiming to beentitled to perform services at the Coronation.In accordance with precedent the two bodies wouldbe distinct, but their membership would be the same.After the approximate date for the Coronationhad been settled, the Lord President proposed, withthe concurrence of the prime Minister, to advise the King that the above procedure should be followed.The Cabinet agreed:That the Lord President of the Council&apos;sMemorandum (CP. 67 (36)) should beconsidered by a Cabinet Committee composed as follows:The Lord President of the Council(:in the Chair),The Lord Chancellor,The Secretary of State for Home Affairs,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The First Commissioner of 7/orks.The Committee was asked to note the viewof the President of the Board of trade that from the point of view of trade, june was the best month for the holding of the coronation.
6.     The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumby the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs (CP. 74 (36))  concerning the Latininscription on the new Seals now to be designed.      Itwas contended by the Union of South Africa that theLatin inscription hitherto authorised was an incorrectversion of the approved English wording.      The trouble was that the assent of all the Dominion Parliaments,as well as of the Parliament at Westminster,wasnecessary before any change could be made.Another version which had been suggested by theUnion Government itself was not altogether satisfactory as it stood, but would be accurate and acceptable inthe following amended forms    &quot;Edwardus VIII Dei GratiaMagnae Britanniae, Hiberniae et terrarum Britannicarumtrans mare jacentium Rex, Pidei Defensor, IndiaeImperator.&quot;      It was suggested accordingly that theUnion Government should be told that,  if they find oninquiry that the proposal now made commends itself toall the Dominions, and that all the other Governmentsconcerned are prepared to take such parliamentaryaction as is needed on their part to permit of an alteration being made, we should be quite willing totake whatever parliamentary action might be necessary on our part.      It should be made clear, however, tothe Union Government that any substantial delay causedby discussion of the question would be very embarrassing^
After some discussion, the Cabinet agreed:(a)To approve in principle the proposal of the Secretary of State for HomeAffairs and the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs as set forth inC74 (36).pM- ConCU^i&quot; udCU ttu(b) That the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs should be authorised to informthe High Commissioner for South africa in London that if it is found on inquirythat their proposal (modified as suggestedin Go P. 74 (36)) commends itself to allthe Dominions and that all the otherGovernments concerned are prepared to take such Parliamentary action as is needed ontheir part to permit of an alteration beingmade, we should be quite willing to takewhatever Parliamentary action might benecessary on our part^ia-lthough-^we^a-r-e-c on tent wd th-1he---present- si tua ti on-.      Heshould add that any substantial delaycaused by discussion of the question would bevery embarrassing.(c) That the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs should also do what he could to induce the High Commissioner for SouthAfrica in London to allow His Majesty&apos;s :Government in the United Kingdom to actas a post office in transmitting their proposal to other Dominions.     As, however,the South African High Commissioner hadinstructions to negotiate with the other dominion High Commissioners, it was recognised that if he insisted he could notbe stopped from direct communications..(d) In any communication to any Dominionit should be made quite clear that HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom is satisfied with the present situation,though willing to make the change if theDominions themselves desired.
WADCASTING.eport of theUswaterQsmittee.previous reference .Cabinet 6 (35) ,Conclusion 10.)7.     The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePostmaster General (CP. 24 (36)), covering theReport of the Committee set up in 1935 in order toconsider the future of the broadcasting serviceafter December 31st next, the date on which thepresent Charter of the B.B.C would expire.      Therewas also attached a note by the Governors of theB.B.C.,  commenting on the Report.      Broadly speaking,Lord Ullswater&apos;s Committee had recommended no radical change in the existing systemi    the modificationsproposed were directed to strengthening it.      the reservations by Mr. Attlee and others mainly reflecteddifferences of emphasis.     Among the principalrecommendations of the Committee were the extensionof the B.B.C.&apos;s Charter for 10 years (not 20 years,as desired by the B.B.C.  itself)5    the division of ministerial responsibility between the PostmasterGeneral, who would be concerned solely with technicalcontrol, and a senior Member of the Cabinet;    and anew distribution of the net revenue from licences.The Treasury, however, dissented from this lastrecommendation in one particular.      They wereprepared to agree to the initial assignment to theCorporation of 75% of this revenue, but as regardsthe balance they proposed the following procedure&quot;If and when the Corporation considerthat 75% of the net revenue has not provedsufficient for their various services theywill be at liberty to raise the question withthe Treasury when, in a friendly review ofthe Corporations financial position and requirements as a whole, the amount of anysupplemental payment can be satisfactorilysettled.&quot;
The proposal that the ownership and. operationof relay exchanges and the technical development ofwire broadcasting in general should be undertaken by the Post Office and the control of relayedprogrammes by the Corporation, was strongly criticised by the First Commissioner of Works and other Ministers.The Chancellor of the Exchequer also statedthat he had certain points to raise.The Cabinet agreed:(a) That the Postmaster-General&apos;s Memorandum(CP. 24 (36)) should be referred to a ministerial Committee composed asfollows:The Chancellor of the Exchequer orThe Financial Secretary to theTreasury,The Secretary of State for HomeAffairs,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The Minister of Health,The President of the Board ofEducation,The First Commissioner of Works,The Postmaster-General.(b) That the Postmas ter-Genexial should have authority at once to publish theReport of Lord Ullswater&apos;s Committee.(c) That if asked for the views of HisMajesty&apos;s Government on the Report, heshould reply that the matter was underconsideration.
2f.l o*&apos; GARMY AND! FORCEfaUAL) BILL,reviousIference?lUnet 16 (35),Inclusion 7;)PR. II. C^)^&quot;8..   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (CP. 69 (36)), submittingfor approval the draft Army and Air Force (Annual)Bill.      It was necessary for this compulsory annualmeasure to receive the Royal Assent by the end ofApril, and it was proposed to take all the stages inthe House of Commons before the Easter recess.      Theonly part of the draft which called for attention wasClause 5, which repealed that part of Section 146 ofthe Army Act under which regular officers on the activelist were not now eligible for appointment as mayor,alderman or councillor of a municipal corporation - adisqualification which did not extend to county,district or parish councils, and did not apply to other ranks.      It was proposed in future to deal with thewhole matter by King&apos;s Regulations.      This was inaccordance with the view taken by the BlanesburghCommittee on the Parliamentary, etc., candidature of Crown Servants..The Cabinet approved the introduction in the House of Commons of the draft Armyand Air Force (Annual) Bill attached to cp.  69 (36).
9.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Health (CP. 72 (36)), to whichwere appended the Second Interim Report of theDepartmental Committee on Local Government andPublic Health Consolidation (Cmd. 5059) and adraft Public Health Bill prepared by the Committee(Cmd. 5060),      The Minister&apos;s recommendation wasthat this Bill should be introduced in the Houseof Lords, and that after Second Reading there thetwo Houses should be invited to appoint a joint select Committee to consider the measure.     Therewas no reason to suppose that it would make unduedemands on Parliamentary time - he was assured that it would be welcomed by the interests con-cerned.The draft Bill was intended to be the first and principal instalment of public healthconsolidation?    its 334 clauses represented there-enactment of some 600 sections scatteredthrough some 30 or 40 Acts of Parliament..     Itwas not, however, a pure Consolidation Bill.The Cabinet approved the Minister ofHealth&apos;s recommendation that the PublicHealth Lav/ Consolidation Bill should beintroduced in the House of Lords, andthat after Second Reading there, thetwo Houses should be invited to appoint a Joint Select Committee to consider themeasure.
international labour organisation.Draft convention concerning theEmployment ofv/omen on Under-ground work inMines.(previous references cabinet 8 (36) ,Conclusion 11.)10.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Labour (CP. 68 (36))  recommending the ratification of a draft Convention concerning theemployment of v/omen on underground work in mines,adopted by the International Labour Conference inJune, 1935.      (For this Convention see Cmd. 5033,already circulated to the Cabinet as an annex to cp. 41 (36)).     With a few unimportant exceptionsthe Convention forbade the employment of women on allwork of the kind described.      The law of the UnitedKingdom, however, was already stricter than theConvention, and it was possible to ratify the latterwithout fresh legislation.The Cabinet approved the ratification of the draft Convention concerning theemployment of &quot;women on underground workin mines, adopted by the InternationalLabour Conference in June 1935.
