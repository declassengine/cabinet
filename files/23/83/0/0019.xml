GERMANY.The locarno treaty.German re-cccupationof demilitarised zone.1*    The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs handed round the following documents:(1) A confidential print of his memorandum of his conversation withthe German Ambassador on the previous evening:(2) The record of the conversation between representatives of the locarno powers (other than Germany) in Parison Tuesdayt March 10th at 10.30 a.m.(previous reference:Cabinet 18 (36)Conclusion 1).Leakaga ofInformation.(previous reference:Cabinet 34 (35)Conclusion 5).There was an intervalduring which members ofthe Cabinet studied theabove documents.The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs reported that as yet he had received no reply from Berlin.      His impression wasthat the German Ambassador was a good dealworried at the present position.Attention was called to the factthat information had appeared in several ofthe newspapers of the very secret mattersdiscussed at the Cabinet on the previous evening.     Apart from members of the cabinet and the Secretary the only persons to whom theinformation had been communicated were theGerman Ambassador and the High commissioners of the Dominions who, however, had been warned of the great secrecy of the matter andbeeneven/asked not to telegraph it to their governments that night.The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that in view of the leakage hethought it indispensable to inform french ministers at an early stage, of the action that had been taken on the previous evening.    soon after that he proposed that the large meeting should adjourn and that conversations should be- 1 -
confined to Ministers (and the Italian representative)only. If no reply had been received from Germanyand we were asked what course we proposed he would reply &quot;to negotiate&quot;. He would propose also tomake clear that we did not intend to answer questions as to our own action in various con-contingencies until negotiations had reached a definitestage. If we were to enter on   negotiations he considered that in addition to any contributionGermany could make we ought to consider whether therewas anything we could do to help. He recalleda suggestion that had been brought to Londonsometime ago by M. Hymans, the object of which wasto preciser Locarno. If that was brought up he proposed to ask what the proposals were. his impression was that M. Hymans&apos;  idea had been to cut out the stage of consultation   ef   the Councilof the League of Nations from the Locarno procedureso that in the event of an actual invasion of france  or Belgium we should be brought in aute-maticallyaThe Prime Minister thought that thatwould involve a dangerous commitment, especially when all? action was considered, and that no commitment ought to be taken.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsalso pointed out that at a time when we founddifficulty in carrying out an existing commitmentit was not a sound policy to accept a heavier one.Another suggestion was that we ought tomake clear to the French that we did not considermilitary action appropriate in the present situation,&apos;     -    -    1 &apos; &apos;first because it was out of proportion to whatS3 *-*
Germany had done, and second because it would not really help a future settlement.Yet another suggestion was that our line should be that before considering more drastic measures we thought that conciliation ought to be pursued.The remainder of the meeting was occupied in a general discussion on the points likely to beraised by French Ministers and. the kind of reply that might be given but no decisions were asked for or given on this subject.Request for representation Tne Secretary of State for dominion of theDominions, Affairs reported that the High Commissioner for south Africa had asked if representatives of theDominions could be permitted to sit in and listen to the Locarno conversations. He, himself was naturally anxious to keep the Dominions represen-tat ives as friendly as possible but he thoughtthat Mr.te Water&apos;s request was impossible to meet.The Dominions were not signatories to the Treatyof Locarno. If he tried to comply with Mr.te Water&apos;s suggestion it was not improbable that theCanadian representative and perhaps the Irish FreeState representative would reject the invitation.He proposed, therefore, to reply that the meeting was one of the Locarno Powers and that ifrepresentatives of any other Powers were admittedit would be necessary to open the doors to all.This was agreed to.
FUTURE 2.     The Prime Minister said he did notMEETINGSOF THE anticipate that it would be necessary to cabinet.summon a meeting of the Cabinet during thenext day or two but he hoped that ministers would be careful to leave their telephoneaddresses so that a meeting could be summonedafc short notice,, if necessity should arise.He would not ask his colleagues to cancelspeaking engagements.2, Whitehall Gardens, S. W.I.,12th March, 1936*
