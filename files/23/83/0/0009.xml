1.    In addition to the documents which had beenunder consideration at the Meeting referred to in the margin, the Cabinet had before them the Report(CP. 51 (36)) of the Ministerial Committee, underthe Chairmanship of the Prime Minister, which hadbeen appointed:&quot;To consider the question of Co-ordinationof Defence in the light of the Debate inParliament on Friday, 14th February, 1936,and the Cabinet discussion, and report their conclusions.In the course of the discussion the draft con-tained in CP. 51 (36) was criticised on the ground-that it might not satisfy Parliament that the deputy chairman had sufficient power and initiative .The Prime Minister explained to the Cabinet thatthe Committee had felt it very necessary to protect the position of the Chiefs of Staff so as to enablethem to render purely military reports directwithout the risk at some future date of being sub-jected to pressure from Ministers.        It was essential that the Chiefs of Staff should, not besaddled with responsibility for decisions thatbelong only to the Government.The Cabinet were informed that the Chiefs ofStaff themselves were anxious to be allowed to go. on with their present work, much of which was non-contentious, and could be best done by their meetingalone.        On occasions also even when a matter wascontentious they might prefer to consider it among themselves before discussing it with the Minister.It was urged that it was very important notto impair the efficiency of the present Chiefs ofStaff organisation which was working very well.A suggestion was made that the Deputy Chairmanof the Committee of Imperial Defence should
preside over other Sub-Committees as well as thePrincipal Supply Officers Committee*The Prime Minister thought that the point was quite sufficiently covered by paragraph 3(2) (v)which would enable the Deputy Chairman to make recommendations for any such re-organisation that he might deem necessary.      It would be a mistake,however, to lay too much responsibility on thoDeputy Chairman at the present stage, more especially as he would have very heavy work in connection withthe carrying out of the Defence RequirementsProgramme.The question was raised as to whether theseproposals would be sufficient to satisfy the Houseof Commons.        It was asked whether the deputy chairman would derive his authority entirely fromthe Prime Minister and how he was to act if there wasa clash of view ?       The Chancellor of the Exchequerexplained that in such an event he had understoodthat the Deputy Chairman would first get the vexedquestion discussed between those mainly concerned,with a view to agreement,  if possible, and failingthat he would bring the matter to the Committee ofImperial Defence who might either deal with it orpass it on to the Cabinet.The Cabinet were informed that the Committee&apos;sidea had&apos; been that the Deputy Chairman in such a case should make an objective report, though of coursehe would be entitled to express his own views on theissue.The Cabinet were also reminded that these kinds of issues were usually rather long-range problems to which a certain amount of time could be devoted.
After discussing the Report paragraph by paragraph the Cabinet approved the followingalterations therein:Paragraph 5 (g) (i).    In lines.,fiu and 7delete the words &quot;Defence Policy and requirements committee&quot; and substitute for them &quot;Cabinet orany Gommittee appointed by them&quot;.Paragraph 5 (2) (iii). In order to make clearerthe relation of the Deputy Chairman of theCommittee of Imperial Defence to the Chiefsof Staff Committee this sentence should read as follows:&quot;(iii) personal consultation with theChiefs of Staff together,  including theright to convene under his Chairmanshipthe Chiefs of Staff Committee wheneverhe or they think desirable&quot;.Paragraph 5(2) (iv).    This sentence should be redrafted to read as follows:&quot;(iv) the Chairmanship of the PrincipalSupply Officers Committee, which will include the Chief Industrial adviser to His Majesty&apos;s Government/, the permanent secretary to the Board of Trade and thePermanent Secretary to the Ministry ofLabour&quot;.Paragraph 4 line 7. Before &quot;Deputy Chairman&quot;insert &quot;Chairman ^r&quot;.Paragraph 5.    The redrafting of this paragraph to meet the views of the Cabinet ws^ remitted to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the HomeSecretary and the Secretary to the Cabinet.Their redraft is as follows:&quot;5. The following will be the organisationof the Joint Planning Committee.(a) the present Joint Planning Committee,which consists of the directors of Plans in the three service departments, will continue to function, but will be supplemented by three officers drawn respectivelyfrom the Navy, Army and Air Force,who will be graduates of theImperial Defence College;(b) the three new officers will holdofficial positions on the staffs of their respective Departments.Their work in their own departments will be chiefly that of obtaining the necessary material for thepreparation of joint plans.    but their main work will be oncollective plans prepared by theJoint Planning Committee for submission to the Chiefs of staff committee.&quot;
1 9I ei.Paragraph 6. (b) line 4. Delete the word &quot;new&quot;before &quot;Joint Planning Organisation&quot;.NOTE: A copy of the revised Report (CP. 51 (36) isattached as an Appendix to these conclusions.
DEFENCE 2.     Arising out of the discussion of the lastCO-ORDINATION.paragraph of CP. 51 (36) the Lord Privy Sealinformed the Cabinet that he had not been able toParliamentaryDebates. persuade Lord Salisbury to postpone his motionp% for a Debate in the House of Lords on DefenceII (36)$- Co-Ordination so as to synchronise with the debate in the House of Commons.      Lord Salisbury wouldnot admit that there was any direct connection between the programmes of Defence requirements which were to be announced in the White paper and the subject of Defence Co-OrdinationJ    con-sequently as at present arranged a Debate wouldtake place on Defence Co-Ordination in the Houseof Lords on February S7th* It would be verydifficult and damaging for the Government once more to &quot;stonewall&quot; in that Debate and it appearedessential,  if it took place,  that some announcement should be made on the decisions taken.on Item 1as recorded in the previous conclusion.On the other hand the Cabinet were reminded that the House of Commons objected to the firstannouncement of important decisions being made inthe House of Lords.One suggestion made to meet this difficulty was that the measures of Defence Co-Ordinationshould be announced in the House of Commons byQuestion and Answer on the same day as the Debate inthe House of Lords, The objection to this,however, was that as the recent Debate clearlyshowed,  the question of Defence Co-Ordination is essentially connected in the minds of many membersof the House of Commons with the Defensive programme*Passage on the latter will be much easier if inthe course of Debate the House of Commons can be- 5 -
assured that the thinking machinery hy which theProgramme has been produced is on the right lines.Another suggestion was that a Debate mightbe arranged to take place in the House of commons on the same day as in the House of Lords? namely,Thursday, February 27th. The difficulty in thisproposal was that there would not be time to prepare and issue a White Paper before the Debate and it was felt that to discuss Defence Co-Ordination alone and without the    guidance * of the White Paper wouldbe disadvantageous.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the Lord Privy Seal should approachLord Salisbury again and explain tohim how much more profitable a debate would be in the House of Lords after theissue of a &quot;White Paper, especially if itsynchronised with a Debate in theHouse of Commons.If the Lord Privy Seal could notpersuade Lord Salisbury he might ask himto see the Prime Minister.(b) That if Lord Salisbury insisted onhis motion for February 27th it mightbe well for the Government&apos;s spokesmanto begin by making quite clear the inconvenience and embarrassment towhich Lord Salisbury had subjected them.

CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE.Principles-1.    The following principles are fundamental:-(l) The Prime Minister must he responsiblefor directing the Co-ordination of Defence.      Thisis essential in time of war and he must therefore have the opportunity to study defensive problems first-hand in time of peace.(2) The responsibility of the Service Ministersmust be maintained.(3) There must be a clear definition ofresponsibility among all concerned.The PrimeMinister.2.   At the present time the Prime Minister findsit impossible to undertake all the duties ofCo-ordination of Defence for the following reasons:-(a) The heavy all-round pressure of work;(b) The increase in the work of defence -ordination due to the heavyprogrammes for re-conditioning the Forces,increased in recent months by the Italo-Abyssinian crisis.Deputy Chair-man of C.T.T),and D.P.R.3.    To meet the above situation, the following measures should be adopted:(l) The Prime Minister should retain theChairmanship of the Committee of Imperial defence and of the Ministerial Sub-Committee on defence policy and Requirements.(2) A Deputy Chairman of the Committee ofImperial Defence should be appointed to whom thePrime Minister proposes to delegate the followingduties:-(i) The general day-to-day supervision and control on the Prime Minister&apos;behalf of the whole organisation and activity of the Committee of Imperial
Defence:    the co-ordination of executive action and of monthlyprogress reports to the cabinet or any Committee appointed by them on the execution of the re-conditioningprogrammes:    discernment of any points which either have not been taken up on are being pursued too slowly and(in consultation with the Prime minister or other Ministers or Committees as required) of appropriate measures fortheir rectification:(ii) In the Prime Minister&apos;s absence takingthe Chair at the Committee of ImperialDefence and the Defence Policy and requirements Committee:(iii) Personal consultation with the Chiefs ofStaff together, including the right to convene under his Chairmanship theChiefs of Staff Committee whenever he orthey think desirable:(iv) The Chairmanship of the Principal supply officers Committee, which will includethe Chief Industrial AdviserPermanent Secretary to the T3oard of Tradeand the Permanent Secretary to the Ministryof Labour:(v) Making recommendations as to any improve-ments that he thinks necessary in theorganisation of the Committee of ImperialDefence.4.    The position of the Chiefs of Staff Committeewould be as follows - the individuals composing it have a double function:    each advises his ownpolitical chief, and acting together the Committeepreserves unimpaired the right to submit confidentialreports of their collective military view to theChairman or Deputy Chairman of the Committee ofImperial Defence.      It is not proposed that meetingsof the Chiefs of Staff Committee should normally takeplace under the Presidency of the Deputy Chairman.He would supplement the present activities and initiative of the Chiefs of Staff Committee by guidance and initiative of his    own.     His function should beto ensure that every aspect is fully considered and that difficulties and differences are frankly faced.
staff organisation.5.The following will he the organisation ofthe Joint Planning Committee:-(a) The present Joint Planning Committee,which consists of the Directors of plans in the three Service Departments,will continue to function, hut will hesupplemented by three officers drawnrespectively from the Navy, Army and AirForce, who will be graduates of theImperial Defence College:(b) The three new officers will hold officialpositions on the staffs of their respective departments.      Their work in their ownDepartments will be chiefly that ofobtaining the necessary material for thepreparation of Joint Plans.      But their main work will be on collective plansprepared by the Joint Planning Committeefor submission to the Chiefs of staff committee.(a) The appointment of a Deputy Secretaryto the Committee of Imperial Defence:(b) The appointment of an additional officer to the Secretariat of the Committee ofImperial Defence to act as a whole-timeSecretary to the Joint PlanningOrganisation (vide 5(b) abvve).7.   Appropriate measures to be taken in connectionwith the forthcoming parliamentary debates to announce the above measures of re-organisationand to rebut the mis-statements and injusticesregarding the existing organisation and itsachievements.C. I.D.Secretariat.6.Theabove measures will be supplemented bythe following steps already approved:(Intlld.)S.B.24th February, 1936.
4 h Q1(10WO DISTRIBUTION.Decypher. Sir S.Barton (Addis Ababa).February 20th, 1936.D. (By Wireless) February 20th, 1936.R. 9.15 a.m. February 21st, 1936.No. 69.MOST IMMEDIATE.Most secret.The Emperor sent for the Military Attache at DessieFebruary 19th and dictated to him through Emperor&apos;personal servant in English the following confidentialmessage which he brought me by aeroplane today.The message is addressed to His Britannic majesty and if His Majesty refers it to his government theEmperor asks that the latter will treat it as strictly confidential and of special importance to the Emperor.The Military Attache was asked to return to Dessie ifpossible on February 22nd and contrive to indicate on thatdate to the Emperor by telegraph the minimum delaynecessary for an answer to be received.The message begins:-When Italy started this war she put out news making it appear that Ethiopia was starting the war against italy&apos;s colonies.    Let alone starting the war against italy&apos;s colonies we have been forbidden to have enougharms to police our own country until recent times.    It isnot necessary to tell this matter in detail.But since the aggressiveness of Italy has beendecided and England is one of the countries who has pro-nounced this judgment against Italy this matter is alsoclear.Sanctions which were put into force against Italy
to stop the war have become insufficient. Even more,because Italy was quite prepared for this matter, sanc-tions have become a means to strengthen herself.When we started our defensive war, thoughve knewwe were not equally equipped with arms as Italy, never-theless we wanted to save our honour and await the judgment of the world.      We allowed them to enter our country and massacre our people knowing that we hadunequal arms to match them.      This we did to defendour honour and judgment of the world.Because England has been the main defender of thecase we were hoping England would have aided us in away which would not have touched her honour integrityor armed forces by giving us arms ammunition and loans to carry on our defensive fight.    But though it has beenjudged against Italy that she was an aggressor she hasnot found a way to help the aggressed state neither to stop the war nor to strengthen us.    Not only has Italyviolated a treaty not to use gas against us or other nations but she has been using poison gas against our people to kill women and children.      The world knowshow Italy has bombed Red Cross Hospitals and how she has killed patients in Red Cross Hospitals and how she has massacred those who have taken shelter under theChurch; of these facts the government of England hasbeen informed.The reason that we have refused to accept thejHoare-Laval peace proposition is as the British Govern-:(ment has understood that it was an unjust notificationto the effect that British Government refused to accept it.    The reason we refused it was because we should have:had to pay what was an indemnity regardless of money and blood we have shed.
If England desires to bring peace between us onthe basis of international law she has alwayschampioned and if England has this desire we wish-before any more blood is shed and any more harm is done to our country that England may decide a place where the two countries may meet and negotiate thematter, in the meantime an armistice being called.This may be conveyed to the British Government in thename of the Emperor.The reason we have presented this proposition isthat Signor Mussolini has offered us to negotiatedirectly with her for peace.      If it is necessary to let the British Government know the proposition he hasmade we will do so when reply to this nessage is received.But our hopes and our thought is to bring our country into a higher civilisation and to tie it withbenefit both to our country and to England either inthe form of a protectorate or in the form of a mandatewithout touching our independence and tpwork for development of the country which is our own.    If this latter could be possible we would rather choose thisthan another proposition.(Message ends).My own comments are contained in my telegramNo. 70.
1*1lo 1NO DISTRIBUTION.Decypher.    Sir S. Barton (Addis Ababa).February 20th 1936.D.   (by wireless) February 20th 1936.R. 9.30 a.m. February 21st 1936.No.  70.MOST IMMEDIATE.MOST SECRET.My immediately preceding telegram.This message is evidently the Emperor&apos;s owncomposition and is,  I judge, unknown to any of his ministers or advisers.        Normally he conveys such messages to me in french with no one else present, but in this instance,in the absence of a common language and in accordance withEthiopian practice, he made use of his personal servant whohas some knowledge of English, rather than risk the use of anofficial interpreter.    For this reason I have abstained fromattempt to improve on the English in order to keep as far aspossible the character    of the original, The plural usethroughout indicates the Emperor&apos;s speaking.In my opinion the background of the case is made upof the following:1. Emperor&apos;s genuine dislike of war as such andattachment to peace.2. His realisation of the immense injury which a prolonged war must inflict on his country and particularly on the cause of its reform and progress which is second onlyto its continued independence,  in his aims.3. His realisation that delay in application of furthersanctions coupled with refusal of positive League assistance and recent Italian advances on both fronts render a prolonged struggle inevitable.
4. His conviction emphasised repeatedly andconsistently to me throughout secret conversations of1933 and 1934 that only some form of British guarantee for the future could render possible a stabilisation ofhis relations with Italy.Whilst I realise that a (grp. undec. ) mandate orprotectorate is excluded - and, however embarrassing thecircumstances may be, England is the only country hetrusts - I submit that quite apart from Leagueprinciples and abstract justice we must as realistsaccept the fact that only by assuming^Ln some degreeresponsibility which this trust implies can we hope topromote an early peace.      Prance and Vatican are ruled out as acceptable mediators, and if individual effort is to be utilised we alone remain.    If we refuse he willnot be willing to accept an (? unequal) settlement which he is convinced will only be the first stage onthe road to ultimate absorption of his country by Italy.
evise)Februaryi. Bar ton.PIS ABABA.mm;er.ISTRIBUTION.SECRET.Your telegram Nos. 69 and 70 (of February 20th:Emperor&apos;s plea for intervention).This message from the Emperor seems to me to constitute a more urgent appeal for assistance than your commentswould indicate.      For this reason I shall be glad of a reply as early as possible to my telegram No.  64 (of February19th).In the meantime your reply to His Majesty should makethe following points plain:(l) H.M.Government cannot contemplate any suggestion for the assumption of a British mandate or protectorate overAbyssinia;(2) Any movement for conciliation between the two parties must come from, or be addressed to, the League.His Majesty may rest assured that H.M.Government will play their full part in promoting any effort which may be madeunder this condition^(3) In the course of the debate in the House of commons on February 24th I emphasised that the report of theCommittee of Five must in the opinion of H.M.Governmentremain the foundation of conciliation.    It has always been and will remain H.M.Government&apos;s urgent desire to seeconciliation on this basis attempted;(4.) The Emperor might in these circumstances wish toprofit uy this public and authoritative declaration ofH.M.Government to address to the League an assurance of abyssinia&apos;s readiness and desire to proceed on this basis and to ask that the Committee of Five should again beconvoked.
Should His Majesty decide to adopt this course should be glad to be informed.Following for your own information only.    I donot for the moment desire to enquire the nature of any proposals which may have reached the Emperor from Italy,more particularly if the channel of these proposals isas I should suspect a very unreliable one.
