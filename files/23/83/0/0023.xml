pKMANY ANDfaiS LOCARNOfee AgreementIbetween thefncarno Powers.Mher thanfGermany,[previousISeference:ICabinet 22 (36)I Conclusion 3).1.    In accordance with the decision taken at themeeting earlier in the day referred to in the margin,the Cabinet met as a matter of urgency to considerthe text of the Agreement reached by the locarno powers,other than Germany, (subject to referenceto the respective Governments concerned) which hadbeen put into shape by tne Jurists of the saidPowers in the interval between tne two meetings.Shortly before the meeting the text of theAgreement was circulated (CP. 86 (36)).The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that he and the Lord Privy Seal had seen the German representative, Herr von Ribbentrop, andhad gone through the first draft of the documentwith him but without communicating a copy.      Herr von ribbentrop&apos;s reaction had not been bad.     His main difficulties had been with the proposals for theInternational Force and the nonfortification of the demilitarised Zone.      The British Ministers had pointed out how large had been the concessions fromthe French side and the concessions made by his majesty&apos;s Government on the subject of security, andhad urged that Germany must now make some contributionto a settlement.      Herr von Ribbentrop had not beenespecially interested in the proposed letter by theBritish and Italian Governments to the French and belgian Governments which only provided for the case where the negotiations broke down. He had asked,however, whether there could be General staff conversations between the British and Germans as wellas between the British, French and Belgians.      the answer was in the affirmative if they accepted theAgreement.     The British Ministers had promised thatif the document was approved by the Cabinet, a copyshould be sent to Herr von Ribbentrop that night,
and the German representative had agreed to see theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the morrow.The Secretary of State adaed that he was convincedthat for the present it was important to adhere tothe first alternative as regards the international force, namely, that it should he only in the demilitarised Zone.       This would leave some margin,for bargaining.      He added that he had already seen the British Press and made a general statement to themin order to anticipate the danger of garbled reportsbeing circulated by foreign delegations or in Paris.The statement to Parliament was already half drafted,and he hoped to make it at 3.30 p.m.  on the following afternoon.      He preferred this time to any earlierhour as m. Flandin was speaking in the French Chamberat 4.0 p.m.(The President of the Board of Trade enteredat this point but had to leave before theend of the meeting as he had business inthe House of Commons),The Cabinet then discussed CP. 86 (36)section by section.Sections I, II and III were adopted without much comment.Sections IV and VII. The attention of theCabinet was drawn to Sections IV and VII which did notappear to carry out the intentions of the Locarnoother than Germany,powers/as hitherto explained to the Cabinet.The intention, it was understood, was that ifthe Germans should refuse to refer the Franco-SovietPact of Mutual Assistance to The Hague, or to accept as final the decision of the Court, nevertheless the negotiations should not be held up.      The secondsub-paragraph of Section VII, however, suggested that aproposal to the German Government to take part in
0   f]tj y -J&quot;if that Government explicitly accepts the invitations addressed to it inpursuance of the preceding paragraphs&quot;&quot;The preceding paragraphs&quot; (viz. Sections V and VI)covered a considerable number of points and the invitation in Section IV covered in addition a reference to the Permanent Court of InternationalJustice at The Hague.      It appeared, therefore,that if the German Government refused any of the invitations (including the one in Section IV)the Locarno Powers, other than Germany, might refuseto propose to the German Government to take partin negotiations.This point was discussed at considerablelength and various suggestions were made for amendment, e.g.  in Section IV, instead of &quot;withoutprejudice to the operation of paragraph VII (2)below&quot; to put &quot;without prejudice to the operationof paragraph VII below&quot; - i.e. omitting&quot;(2)&quot;,Sir William Malkin, the British member ofthe Committee of Jurists of the Locarno Powers,other than Germany, was sent for and remained untilthe end of the Cabinet, and after his arrival thequestion was further discussed.The Cabinet were informed by the negotiatingMinisters that there had been no doubt as to theintention of the Locarno Powers, other than Germany,which was that the proposal for the German Governmentto take part in the negotiations should not be with-held if they refused to refer the Franco-SovietPact to Ihe Hague and to accept as final thedecision of the Court.Sir William Malkin thought that if there v/as no doubt about the intention, he could probably clear up the point with the French and Belgian Jurists.
9 a m.p. y iSir William Malkin was asked to look intothe question on the morrow and advise what could hedone to redraft either Section IV  or  Section VIIor both to carry out the above intention.It was suggested that in view of the fact thatM. flandin had already left for Paris and thatthere was no doubt about the intention of the locarno powers, other than Germany, it would be better notto attempt to redraft these Sections before presenting the proposals to Herr von Ribbentrop.  If the GermanGovernment raised the point it would have to beset right.The Cabinet agreed:That no attempt should be made to amendSections IV and VII before handing the document to Herr von Ribbentrop.(See also remarks on Section VII below)Section V.      The comment was made that at theearlier meeting it had been understood that theFrench and Belgian Governments would agree not tomake any new fortifications.      It was explainedthat Section V applied only to provisional arrange-ments in the stage prior to negotiation.    M. Flandinhad talked to his Chief of the General Staff who had stated that it was impossible to drop fortificationat this stage owing to continuing contracts.    Thiswas criticised as a mere matter of money, and theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought thatthis was a point on which the French might haveto make a concession.Section V was approved.Section VI.      In reply to a question theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatthe last words of paragraph (1), viz: &quot;this zone
being entirely reserved for occupation by thesaid international force1&apos; meant that the germans would have to withdraw from the zone occupied bythe international force.It was suggested that this was likely to create a difficulty, and that some arrangement might haveto be made with them.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,in reply to a question on VI (2), said that the swedes or any other nation contributing to theinternational force would be included in theInternational Commission to &quot;supervise the carryingout of the obligations undertaken by the powers whichhave formed the above-mentioned force&quot;.Section VI was approved.Section VII.      The Secretary of State forForeign Affairs explained that the third sub-paragraph was intended to enable Great Britain andItaly to guarantee Belgium and France withoutguaranteeing each other.The Lord Chancellor (without applying his remarks especially to this Section) pointed out thatit would be very important in the course of thenegotiations to exercise vigilance as to the case where France went to the aid of Soviet Russia inaccordance with the Franco-Soviet Treaty.      if germany retaliated against France, we might beapplied      to for assistance.      We must be carefult6 avoid a situation in which we should in effectbe guaranteeing the French Eastern European Pacts.section VII was approved,(See also above,remarks on Sections IV and VII).
Section VIII^   This Section was criticised on the ground that it opened up a very wide field of questions which had hitherto proved extremelycontentious.     For example, our undertaking tosupport the introduction of&quot;1) Agreements organising on a preciseand effective basis the system of collective security and payingattention to the definition of theconditions in which Article XVI of theCovenant of the League of nations should be applied;11appeared to involve our agreeing to define an aggressor which we had hitherto refused to do.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that France wanted some reconstruction of -Article XVI of the Covenant.      M. Paul Boncourhad been told that it would probably come to nothing, but the French Delegation wanted itincluded, possibly as window dressing.Referring to Section VIII as a whole, theLord President of the Council explained that theFrench had wanted to put in a programme of re-construction to balance the subjects suggested by herr Hitler.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out that sub-paragraph (4) relegated to thoend of the Agenda, among other things, the Germanproposals for a Colony.    He said that the following words between (3) and (4) had been left in thedraft through an error -&quot;Declare themselves also ready to examine,as far as they are concerned.&quot;The Cabinet agreed:That the following should be omitted fromthe copy communicated to Herr von ribbentrop -(a) The words which had been left inby mistake, quoted above;(b) The alternative to paragraph (4).Subject to the above Section VIII was approved.
3 GilSection IX was approved without discussion.Draft Resolution to he Presented to the Councilof the League of Nations.The above was approved.o      a t J OCf 111Letter to be addressed by the Representativesof the United Kingdom and Italy to the Representativesof Belgium and Prance.The words at the end of the introductoryparagraph, &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom&quot;, were criticised on the ground that theyshould refer to Italy as well as to the United Kingdom.It was explained, however, that the Governmentof Italy would send a separate identic letter andthat this letter was only a specimen applying to theUnited Kingdom.The question was raised as to whether theGovernment of the United Kingdom would send a letterif Italy refused, and as to what answer would be givenin Parliament if this question was raised.It was explained that the whole of this document would be published as a draft   ad referendumto the Governments;    that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom had decided to support theproposals;    that they were not yet aware of thedecisions taken by other Governments;    and that inthe event of Italy&apos;s refusing to sign the letter,the question would be reconsidered.It was generally realised, however, that HisMajesty&apos;s Government could hardly refuse to sign theletter because Italy had not signed an identic letter.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to thefirst words of the letter -&quot;At the moment when the representatives ofBelgium, Prance, Great Britain and Italyhave just decided, as provided in to-day&apos;sarrangement, the common line of conductof their respective Governments.......&quot;
The assurance given in the draft letter was providedfor in these arrangements.Some discussion took place in regard to paragraph 1 (c) -&quot;will, in return for reciprocal assurances from your Government, take, in consultationWith your Government, all practical measures available to His Majesty&apos;s Governmentfor the purpose of ensuring the security ofyour country against unprovoked aggression&quot;.It was suggested that although the phrase&quot;all practical measures available&quot; could not apply in our case to military action owing to the scantiness6f our Forces, it might be held to involve economic sanctions.It was suggested that economic sanctions would provoke a military attack by Germany, and it waspointed out that the fact of the Germans being in the Rhineland could not be interpreted as anunprovoked aggression.Attention was drawn to the difference in language used at the end of paragraph 1 (c) -&quot;for the purpose of ensuring the securityof your country against unprovoked aggression&quot;and the language used in Section III -&quot;in case of unprovoked aggression&quot;.It was explained, however, that the twoarticles dealt with different circumstances.Section III provided    that during the period of negotiation during which the Treaty of Locarno was still in force, the General Staffs should be instructed forthwith to enter into contact to make arrangements as to what should be done in case of anunprovoked aggression during that period.     Paragraph1 (c) of the letter, on the other hand, provided forthe case where conciliation had failed and forsome new arrangement (of a reciprocal character)
for the purpose of ensuring security againstunprovoked aggression for the future.      In thefirst case the General Staffs were to consider what was to he done after aggression had taicenplace.      The second case was to provide a safe-guard against an aggression taking place.On the whole, it was thought &quot;better not toattempt at this late hour to secure identity of wording.     as a matter of technical editing,however, it was pointed out that/paragraph 1 (d)of the letter the phrase &quot;paragraph III (2)&quot; wasinaccurate as the sub-paragraphs in paragraph IIIwere not numbered.      Some phrase should be used as&quot;the second sub-paragraph of Section III&quot;.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the documents attachedto Co P. 86 (36) subject to thesmall alterations in Section VIIIreferred to above, and subject toany action that might be necessarysubsequently to clear up thedifficulty in Sections IV abd VII.(b) That the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs should be authorisedto communicate them the same evening to Herr von Ribbentrop.(c) That a statement should be made inthe House of Commons on the following,afternoon, March POth, at 3*30 p,m.,and that the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should have authority to issue a White Paper.
GERMANY ANDTHE locarno treaty.future arrangements.2.     The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said he was arranging to see Herr von ribbentrop on the morrow. Herr von Ribbentrophad told him that he was anxious to discuss withthe British G-overnment the course of futurenegotiations generally,in order to clear the grounda little and see whether there was a prospect ofsuccess.Until recently M. Flandin had ratherdesired that the Council of the League of nations should disperse from London^ Before leavingthat afternoon,, however, he had expressed thehope that the Council should remain,and had intimated that he himself would return next Monday.He understood that other members of the Council wereprepared to remain in London.The Cabinet agreed?That it was very desirable thatthe Council of the League ofNations should remain in London.
3*     The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that a meeting of the Council ofThirteen had been arranged for the morrow, Friday-March 20th, but owing to great pressure on him inconnection with the German negotiations he wasasking for a postponement until Saturday, March21st. When the Committee of Thirteen met he anticipated that there might be a strong move to raise the sanctions on Italy in return for a truce between Italy amd Abyssinia, and he wouldlike to know the view of his colleagues.In the course of a short discussion theCabinet were reminded that if sanctions were raisedthey could never be imposed again,       A veryawkward situation would arise if, after a short period of truce, Italy were to resume the war.The result of that would be that Italy wouldhave freed herself from sanctions by merelyagreeing to a short truce. As the main Italianobject at the present time was, presumably, toimprove their communications, a truce would dothem no harm.Doubts were expressed as to whetherAbyssinia would agree to a truce if it meant the dropping of sanctions. There was little doubtthat France wanted to drop sanctions and that we might be unable to secure their continuance.      it seemed clear, however,  that we could not withdrawthem without some prospect of a settlement which went further than mere armistice?
One suggestion was that instead of withdrawing the sanctions now in operation the League might agree to postpone any furthersanctions, e.g. the oil sanction,  if Italy would agree to a truce.The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that he had in mind to suggestthat the Chairman and Secretary-General shouldtouch withget in/both sides with a view to an armistice,if possible, on some basis of peace negotiations.One suggestion was that this basismight amount to &quot;preliminaries of pease&quot;-.The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that all the Powers would want toknow beforehand what our general attitude was-.He thought that the proper reply should be thats anctions ought not to be taken off merely inreturn for a truce, and that we must be assured of peace being in sight.The Chancellor of the Exchequersuggested that if sanctions were taken offbefore peace were in sight there would bepolitical trouble in this country. Theimposition of fresh sanctions, however, was avery different question.The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs agreed.In reply to the Prime Minister theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated
that he had sufficient material with which to go to the Council of Thirteen.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1*,19th March,  1936.
