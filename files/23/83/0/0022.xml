Some of these were handed back    .at     the end of the meeting.
JRMAWY ANDHE locarno treaty.Germane-occupationf thesmilitarised2one*greementreached &quot;by the locarno Powers,other than Germany.previous reference:Cabinet 21 (36)Conclusion 6).PA3.    In the absence of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs who had been detained on business in connection with the international legislation, the Chancellor of the Exchequergave an account of the conversations betweenthe Locarno Powers, other than Germany, which had now culminated in a provisional Agreement.      these negotiations had continued on the previous evening,theuntil 2.0 a.m. that day, after which/british ministers had remained on to get something inwriting.      He was not asking for decisions at thepresent meeting, but only wished to communicate the terms of the Agreement which had been reached.At the end of the meeting he and his colleagues had told M. Flandin that they could not commit themselves on a matter of such importance and thattheir agreement was only provisional pendingreference to the Cabinet.      M.  Flandin was in thesame position as he also had to consult the FrenchCabinet,      He would, however, be glad of any indication he could receive of the attitude of theBritish Cabinet as he had to address the Chamberon Friday afternoon.The Chancellor of the Exchequer then went through the heads of the Agreement showing how at every point concessions had been secured in thedirection desired by the Cabinet.       The documentincluded -a revision of the latest draft communicated by M. van Zeeland on March 18th,a drastic revision of a letter to beaddressed by the representatives of GreatBritain and Italy to the representativesof Belgium and France,
A ^ aU It ia draft resolution to be.presented to theCouncil of the League of Nations.(NOTE:    As the text of the documentfinally revised by the Jurists ofthe Locarno Powers, other than.Germany, was to be circulated thesame evening for consideration bythe Cabinet at a late meeting,details are not given here).Towards the end of the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s statement the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs entered.        In reply to a questionhe said that he inclined to the view that the wholeof the document should be made public, including theletter to the French and Belgian Governments.Some discussion then took place as to when a communication on the subject should be made toParliament;    whether and when it should be published as a white Paper, and what communication should bemade to Herr von Ribbentrop.No decisions were taken, but on the first two points the general view was that since M. Flandinwould be making a statement in Paris on the next day,Friday, March 30th, a statement should also be madein Parliament:    but that owing to the technicalnature of the Agreement,it would be eminently desirable,if possible, and by arrangement, if necessary, withthe French Government to publish a White paper before the weekend.As regards Herr von Ribbentrop, the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs explained that he couldnot communicate the document until it had been finally approved by the Cabinet, and he foresawconsiderable difficulties in explaining it adequatelywithout showing the document to the Germanrepresentative.
0 k  The Cabinet recognised that it was inconvenientto have to deal with the publication of a documentof such importance at very short notice.     Thedifficulty was, however, that the French Chamber was holding its last meeting before the Elections onthe next day, Friday, March SOth, after which it wouldadjourn.      It was, therefore, essential for M. Flandin,who had left for Paris by air that same afternoon,to make his statement on the morrow.In order to facilitate the task of theSecretary of State ror Foreign Affairs in any communi-cation that he might have to make to M. Flandin andHerr von Ribbentrop, the Cabinet agreed:(a) To meet the same evening in the PrimeMinisters room, House of Commons, at10,0 p.m., but that this decision shouldbe provisional in case the Jurists of the locarno Powers had not completed their draft.(b; That the Secretary should circulate the draft of the Jurists or (if possible)as much of the draft as was ready at.30 p,m.(c) To leave to the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to decide on the natureof any communication he might make to herr von Ribbentrop,At the conclusion of the meeting the PrimeMinister congratulated the delegates (the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, the Lord President ofthe Council,  the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theLord Privy Seal) very warmly on the very successfulresult of their negotiations.S, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.1,,19th March, 1936.
