ANGLO-- egyptianIreaty.\ .instructions&apos; to Sir Miles! Lampson.(Previousfeeference:Rabinet 6(36)Conclusion 6),f.R.S.    The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. 48 (36))covering the text of the instructionswhioh it was pronosed to send to Sir Miles Lamp-son for his guidance in the forthcoming treaty negotiations.After a short discussion the cabinet agreed:To approve the above instructionssubject(a) to re-examination by theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs of the wording of thethird sentence of paragraph 1beginning with the words &quot;this basis is that....&quot;(b) to a reference in paragraph 3to the provision of alternativebarrack accommodation at theexpense of the egyptian government which is already referred to in paragraph 2.
3.      The Secretary of Stfte for Foreign affairs recalled that when the question of an oil sanctionagainst Italy had been under consideration twoof the principal    arguments used had b een thatit might antagonise Signer Mussolini so farthat he would precipitate a war against thiscountry and that in any event Italy was not goingto win the war.       He gave a full account of a conversation he had had with Mr, R.L.Nosworthy,Commercial Counsellor at His Majesty&apos;s embassy at Rome, who had only recently been for a tourin Northern Italy,        From this account and fromother news which had reached the Foreign Officeit seemed less likely that Italy would retaliateto sanctions by a fresh aggression; that theapplication of an oil sanction would involve aserious weakening of the morale of the Italiannation; and that if oil sanctions were notapplied and nothing else was done there was apossibility that Italy might win the war sincefinancially it seemed probable that she could continue/f-or--another year.        The difficult position that would arise at Geneva when the oil sanctionwas considered also had to be taken into account.In the circumstances he had instructed theForeign Office to examine certain other suggestions for further sanctions, e.g.(l) stopping food supplies to Italian colonies which, however, did not appear likelyto be very effective, and(2) a shipping sanction under which themembers of the League would refuse to
or to give facilities for Italianshipping in their ports.The latter proposal was felt to require very close examination.&apos; The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said he would have circulated a memorandum in the earlyfuture raising these points.       He himself was incliningto the view that as regards the oil sanction, if it wasdeemed ineffective,  the best course for the League totake would be to pass a resolution re-affirming its willingness to apply an oil sanction but in accordancewith Hie report of the Expert Committee referring thematter to the United States of America. The mamobjection to this proposal was that the United StatesGovernment and people would probably take umbrage at it*He would like his colleagues to consider the proposalbefore the next meeting.-After some discussion the Cabinet agreed:(a) to take note that the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs would in the nearfuture circulate a memorandum raising the issues on which a decision was required before the question of the oil sanction was discussed at Geneva:(b) that the Secretary of State for War should circulate a military appreciation of thesituation in Abyssinia in which shouldbe included references to such subjects as the power of the Abyssinian nation to maintain its armies in the fieldhaving regard to difficulties of food supply, lack of sanitation, communications and so forth.The Home Secretary entered at this point.

The Cabinet were informed that the PrimeMinister had communicated their previous decisionto the Irish Free State High Commissioner in Londonand that subsequently the Prime Minister hadreceived a letter from Mr. de Valera in his ownhand asking for a reconsideration of the Cabinet^decision on the gound that it would make a settlement between the two countries more difficult.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs reported that he had received a visit from Mr, Dulantyon Monday evening,        Mr, Dulanty who, on previous occasions did not seem to have considered thedifficulties very serious, had found on a recent visit to Dublin   that the question was causing muchdisturbance. It was unlikely that Mr, de Valerawould have &quot;brought the question forward except underthe pressure of strong public opinion in Irelandincluding that of the Dail*pointed-eurt^that^n^^the - excuse could be made-that, th^-application had come from the Government of a Dominion. against this must be set the strong feeling that would bearoused in this country, .y        His suggestion was thatthe Prime Minister should reply to Mr.de Valera tathe effect that he agreed in the desirability of avoiding any action calculated to prevent areconciliation: that His Majesty1s Government had refused the request for Roger Casement&apos;s body on the ground that its return to Ireland wouldinvolve demonstrations in -4hi?&amp; country calculated toincrease the difficulties of conciliation. Thiswould leave it open to Mr.  de Valera to offer to
1 VIensure that no demonstration would be allowedto take place.In the discussion that followed thegeneral view was that Mr.  de Valera could not prevent a demonstration and perhaps even anannual demonstration and was unlikely to offer to make the attempt.The Cabinet agreed:(a) to adhere to their previous decision referred to in the margin:(b) that the reply to Mr. de Valerashould be in very friendlyterms:(c) that the Home Secretary and theSecretary of State for DominionAffairs should consult as to theterms of the letter to be sent by the Prime Minister.,
9 rHaiRS IN 6*    The Cabinet had before them tne following&apos;(ENYA.r   ^ papers j-Che HighlandsQuestion. A Memorandum by the Secretary of StatePrevious for tne Colonies (CP. 7 (36)), statingReferences that the Cabinet need not be troubledCabinet 20 (34), with the greater part of the demandsConclusion b.) made at a recent &quot;Settlers&apos; Parliament&quot;&apos; in Kenya.     An exception was the claim of the European settlers for security inthe Kenya Highlands.      If the cabinet approved, the Secretary of State was prepared to draft an Order in Councildefining the boundaries of the Highlandsarea.     He was also ready to repeat the assurance that there was no present intention of departing from theadministrative xoractice of the last 30years, whereby this area is reserved for white settlement.     The settlers wishedhim to include in the Order in Councilfurther provisions giving statutoryeffect to this administrative practice,but this he was unwilling to do.A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor India (CP. 18 (36)  (Revise)), whoinformed the Cabinet that he could haveaccented the above proposal were it not for Article 3 of the St. GermainConvention, to which India had adheredas a Member of the League.      He had notyet reminded the Government of India ofthe bearin0 of the Convention on thepresent difficulty, but he could not undertake to keep them permanently inthe dark.      It seemed to him that itwould be very difficult to defend evenadministrative discrimination againstIndians, particularly if Japanesenationals were conceded the right tox;urchase land in the Highlands.A further Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies (CP. 43 (36))pointing out that tAere was no reason to suppose that Japan would claim this ri0ht.If she did, and if her claim could not be resisted, the position of Indians wouldhave to be considered.      The present proposal for an Order in Council merelydefining geographical boundaries tookaway nothing,  either from the Europeansor from the Indians.In 1fche course of a discussion the Secretary ofState for India gave an exposition of the difficultiesof the Government of India in the course of which hesuggested that:
(l) the Cabinet should agree ihat there is a moral obligation to admit Indians to the Highlandsas soon as any other Asiatics are admitted -though no public statement should be made onthe subject,and(2) that he should not be debarred from tellingthe Viceroy that he had considered whetherthe Convention had any bearing on thequestion; but that he had come to theconclusion that so long as there was no discrimination in fact between Indians andother Asiatics it did not affect theproposal merely to schedule the KenyaHighlands without embodying in the Order any statutory prescription of privileges.After considerable discussion the Cabinet agreed:(a) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should be authorised to pre-pare an Order-in-Council defining the boundaries of the Kenya Highlandsarea:(b) That if Japan should claim the rightto purchase land in the Kenya High-lands the question would have to beconsidered by the Cabinet,
fHE COAL MINESHHT II OE THE:0AL MIif.,S ACT,MO).[previous[Reference %Cabinet 46 (35&apos;nI7.    The Cabinet had before them a Note by thepresident of the Board of Trade (CP. 44 (36)),covering a memorandum by the Secretary for mines in which authority was asked to prepare a Billamending Part II of the Coal Mines Act, 1950.The object of the proposed amendment was to remedy the deficiencies disclosed by the Vest Yorkshirecase, and by a recent opinion of the Law Officers,and to re-establish beyond doubt the intention ofparliament to vest in the Re-organisation Commissionpower to compel amalgamations, to the extent thatthey are desirable in the national interest and cannot be secured by voluntary action on the partof the coal owners themselves.      In order to givethe owners a final breathing space, it was proposedthat the power of compulsion should be post-datedin its application for not less than two years.The Secretary for Mines, who had been invitedto attend the Cabinet for this discussion, made astatement of the present position.      In the course ofthat statement he suggested that if legislation were passed compulsion should be post-dated by two yearsand that when compulsory amalgamation became possible,provision ought to be made for some statutory authority vesting in Parliament some control over theCommission.Discussion took place mainly on the proposalto postpone compulsory amalgamation for two years afterthe passage of the Bill.      The view of the cabinet was that, in so much as for some four to six years the coal-owners, though under the impression thatcompulsion was provided for, had postponed theadoption of voluntary amalgamation schemes, and had- 10 -
finally escaped from amalgamation &quot;by the discoveryof a loop-hole in the Lav/ of 1930, they were not entitled to any further consideration.     Moreover,such postponement would he very discouraging tothe miners following closely on the recent disputewhich the Secretary for Mines had dealt with sosuccessfully.      In the circumstances, the cabinet agreed:(a) That the Secretary for Mines should beauthorised to prepare a Bill amendingPart II of the Coal Mines Act, 1930,as proposed in CP, 44 (36).(b) That the Bill should not make provisionfor an extension of the period whencompulsory amalgamation should begin.(c) That the Bill should be referred to theHome Affairs Committee,(d) That the Secretary for Mines should consult the Prime Minister before making any announcement of these decisions.

The Cabinet had before then a Memorandum by theMinister of Health (CP. 46 (36)), in v/hich it was stated that the value of the present consolidation ofthe Public Health law would be enhanced if a newx.rivate streets code could be incorporated.     he therefore    asked for authority to prepare a Bill ofwhich the principal object would be to replace by asingle code the two private streets codes now operating in different parts of the country.      In the main, andsubject to minor amendments, the new code would bebased on the Private Street Works Act, 1892.The Cabinet authorised the Ministerof Health to prepare a Bill as proposedin CP.  46 (36) and summarised above.

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Labour (CP. 45 (36)), covering the lastannual Report of the Beveridge Committee, dealing withthe financial condition of the Unemployment Fund atDecember 31st, 1935.      With the concurrence of hiscolleagues, the Minister proposed to publish the Report,which showed that a surplus of about  6,500,000 a year was available for disposali    and to announce inparliament that it had been decided to use this surplus to reduce the rates of contribution in respect of allpersons of 18 years of age and over by Id., from thebeginning of July next.      The reduction would apply tothe contributions of employers, workers and theExchequer alike.      A resolution by both Houses wouldbe required.      Such a decision would, follow therecommendations which the Beveridge Committee had adopted by a majority of 5 to 2.      The Memorandum gavereasons against ado-pting either of the separate viewstaken by the two dissenting members of the Committee.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Minister of Labour as setforth in CP, 45 (36) and summarised above.
