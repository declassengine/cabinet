ATTENDANCEOP ministers AT DIVISIONS..2Cf [bi)-b.1.      The Prime Minister drew attention to thefact that in a division in the House of commons on April 1st which resulted in the defeat of theGovernment, twenty-three Ministers were absent.      he proposed, therefore, to send a request to all ministers to work as much as possible in their rooms in theHouse of Commons when the House was sitting.      Thepresence of Ministers in the House always had agood effect on the rank and file of the Party, andtheir absence exercised exactly the- contrary effect.- 1 -
GERMANY ANDJ THE locarno treaty.I The Meetingiat Geneva.previous Reference:1 Cabinet 27 (36)jConclusion 4).3U- 0^L-2.      The Prime Minister read the following telegram which he had received that morning fromthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in Paris:Appearances suggest that French Governmentwill concentrate on securing our support forrefusal to allow zone to he fortified.      Theymay well ask us to join in making clear to GermanGovernment that if demand is refused sanctionsby Locarno Powers will follow.      They may add that if sanctions in support of so reasonable ademand cannot be visualised against Germany theycannot be maintained against Italy.      There is thus every indication of a very difficult meetingat Geneva even when every allowance is made forelement of electioneering in (grp.  undec.)programme.     His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador adds thathe regards position as so serious thatsignificance of electioneering influence playsa very small part.The Lord&apos; Privy Seal, the Prime Minister said, wasleaving for Paris that evening and would be able togive the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs an impression of the Cabinet&apos;s reaction to the abovetelegram,The Parliamentary Under-Secretary said he had no further news to report and that as the abovetelegram had only arrived shortly before the Cabinet,he had not been able to consult the Foreign office on the subject.In the course of the discussion attention was drawn to the suggestion that if the GermanGovernment refused a demand that they should undertake not to fortify the Demilitarised gone&quot;sanctions byLecarno Povirers will follow&quot;.      Since Italy was herselfthe subject of sanctions she could not be expectedto impose sanctions on Germany.      The proposal, there-fore, was that the United Kingdom should join Franceand Belgium in applying sanctions.      Stress was laid on the difference between sanctions applied by all themembers of the League of Nations against a Power that
had been found by the Council to have committed an aggression, and their application by three ofthe signatories of the Locarno Treaty.      For thelatter proposal there was no authority of any sortor kind and sanctions would be provocative withoutbeingeffective.       There was no authority containedin the Locarno Treaty.      The Cabinet felt that the essence of sanctions was that they must becollective and effective.      Neither of theseconditions would apply to sanctions imposed asproposed by the French.      It was suggested that theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs should make clear that sanctions could not be imposed by the locarno Powers in the manner suggested.The view was expressed that the probableaim of the French attitude, if correctly reported,was to bring about the raising of sanctions from italy.      The French Government must know perfectly well that we would not agree to impose sanctionson Germany, and they would argue that in that eventsanctions could not be maintained against Italy.It was recognised by the Cabinet, however,that for the reasons given above as to the distinction between sanctions imposed by the league and sanctions imposed by the Locarno Powers, thetwo cases were not in pari materia.There was general agreement that if thequestion of the French refusal to allow the demilitarised Zone to be fortified were raised, theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs would bejustified in refusing to admit that conciliationhad failed. He might also make clear that if
and when the point was reached where conciliationhad failed, our action would be guided by the lettersof April 1st under which our first action would.beconsultation with the French and Belgian governments as to the steps to be taken to meet the new situation(Gmd.  5149, Nos.  2 and 5).One suggestion was that the French should be warned that to raise sanctions from Italy would be toplay straight into the hands of Germany.The Prime Minister thought that the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs would be well a dvised toavoid discussing with the French Government alone the-question of raising sanctions from Italy.      If requestedto do so, his reply would he that this was a question for the League.It was pointed out that if we were to agreeto the French proposal to apply sanctions, we should besacrificing the advantages we had gained in thenegotiations that led to the    letters to France andBelgium of April 1st.Another suggestion was that we should remind the French that if and when discussions took place with the Germans as contemplated in the recent white paper, the question of fortifications was bound to beraised.The Lord Privy Seal reported that he had justseen Herr von Ribbentrop who had come to say goodbye.The German envoy had said that anxious as he was forconversations to taice place, he felt bound to make clearthat they could not take place if anything occurredthat trammelled German sovereignty.The Cabinet were reminded, however, that a
voluntary relinquishment, whether temporary orpermanent, of the right to build fortificationswould not be an infringement of the sovereignty ofGermany in the Rhineland any more than the non-fortification clause of the Washington Treaty was an infringement of British sovereignty in Hong Kong,The Lord President of the Council, who had also seen Herr von Ribbentrop, had gathered thatcontemplating       in the Demilitarised ZoneGermany was now     / field fortifications/whichmight in practice be almost as formidable as the tMaginot lines.        For the moment they could not startas they had to make plans and cut down trees.      he himself had pointed out to Herr von Ribbentrop thatthe mere fact of our request to Germany to desistfrom building fortifications was a recognition oftheir sovereignty.It was pointed out that the real difficulty would arise if and when some action by Germany enabled the French to claim that conciliation had failed.At the end of the discussion the Lord Privy Sealundertook to report its general trend to theSecretary of State for Fa? eign Affairs.
bsRMAHY andehb locarno[treaty.The staff conversations.^previousJjRef erence:Cabinet 26 (36),fConclusion 2).3.      The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary (CP. 105 (36)) covering an extract fromthe draft Minutes of the 276th Meeting of theCommittee of Imperial Defence, together with aMemorandum by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee(C.I.D. Paper No. 1224-B) dealing with the forth-coming Staff Conversations with the Locarno Powers.The Conclusions of the Committee of Imperial Defenceare attached in the Appendix.The Minister for Co-Ordination of defence said that the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee had made a request to him that two questions might be cleared up by the Cabinet before the Anglo-Belgian-French military conversations fixed for April 15th.(i) Whether the conversations are, at the outset, to be begun with the Belgian andFrench Attaches in London or with regulardelegations.        In view of the very limited authority which the Committee ofImperial Defence propose for the british general Staffs it appears highly understandable that the French and BelgianGeneral Staffs should be encouraged tosend senior officers.(ii) Whether advance information should begiven to the French and Belgian Govern-ments as to our idea of the scope of the conversations. In view of the limi-tations o.-i the proposed instructions to our general Staffs this would appear to bethe only fair course and the one best calculated to avoid embarrassment,particularly if delegations a re coming fromBrussels and Paris.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary said thatthe Foreign Office view was that the French, having made a concession in deferring the conversationsuntil April 15th, would receive rather a shock ifthey were asked to limit the conversations toAttaches,      He suggested instead that we mightpropose the same procedure as had been adopted at the&apos;
Paris conversations last autumn in connection withthe Mediterranean situation where one or, if desired,two General Staff Officers had teen associated withthe Attaches.The Secretary of State for Air reported thathe had received from the Chief of the Air Staff aseries of questions as to what points might or mightnot he disclosed in the course of the military conversa-tions*     He thought it very important that the three services should he agreed on this subject so thatthere might be no misunderstanding as to their instructions when the Staff conversations took place.After discussion the Cabinet agreed:(a) That the Foreign Office should suggest to the French and Belgian governments that the conversations should be begunnext week with the Military Attachesin the first instance.(b) That if the French and Belgian Govern-ments rejected the proposal in (a),the suggestion should be made to themthat the precedent of the Paris conver--sations, arising out of the Mediterran-ean situation, should be followed,and that one, or, if necessary, twoStaff Officers should be associatedwith each of the Attaches in the conversations.(c) That subject to the above, therecommendations of the Committee ofImperial Defence should be approved,(Appendix).(d) That in order to prepare for the staff conversations, the following immediate action should,be taken:(i) The Joint Planning Sub-Committee(or such other body as the Chiefsof Staff Sub-Committee might decide) should meet the same afternoon to formulate any questions on which the british delegates to the military conversations required a decision in advance.(ii) The Minister for defence -Ordination should meet the
Chiefs of Staff on the following morning before the Cabinet and takethe decisions necessary on the pointsformulated at the meeting referredto in (i).

The Secretary of State for the colonies reported that the Arabs in Palestine had acceptedthe offer for an Arab Deputation to cone to london to state their case and that the Deputation wouldbe in London on the 4-th May.     The Marquess ofLothian had agreed to the suggestion of theSecretary of State for the Colonies that he should withdraw the motion he had put down for discussion by the House of Lords.t
asR) CORONATIONllreviouspf erence:Cabinet 26$36), Coil-&quot; conclusion 5.)f.r.      x9-7.    The Cabinet had before them the second report of the Cabinet Committee 021 the coronation (CP. 101 (36)).      The Committee&apos;conclusions were as follows:-&quot;(l)   We recommend the Cabinet to approve, for submission to HisMajesty, Thursdaj?-, May 13th,or failing that day - WhitMonday, May 17th.      These appearto be the only two practicabledates in May, 1937.(2)    That, while the day fixed forthe Coronation should be declared a Bank and public holiday throughout the UnitedKingdom, it is unnecessary to declare a second Bank or public holiday for other ceremonies(such as the State Procession)connected with the Coronation,which might conveniently takeplace on a Saturday.&quot;The Lord Pi/esident of the Council gave theCabinet a summary of the report.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said hehad received representations from the Chamber ofShipping which reported very strong objection fromports all over the country to the holding of the coronation on the 13th May, as great numbers ofships sail on that date and the da3?-s immediately following.The President of the Board of Trade said thathe had fully stated the case of the shippinginterest, but any other dalze involved even agreater accumulation of objections.The Cabinet agreed -To approve(a) /Jor submission to His majesty the recommendations of the CabinetCommittee set forth above.(b) That the Lord President of theCouncil should make the necessarysubmission to The King.(c) That the Secretars^ of State forDominion Affairs, when informing the Dominions of til is decision,should tell them that no announcement was to be made before easter.
(]36), (o))would therefore be essential to settle an order of priorityamong Defence requirements, and then to arrange contracts in such a way as to make the best use of the labour available.      Any attempt to produce the requirements at agreater speed than the labour supply made possible woulddefeat its own ends.      It would be desirable for the SupplyOrganisations to work in close touch with the Ministry ofLabour.   . Again,  since the prospects of increased employ-ment due to the programme could not he other than temporary,it would be difficult to enlist the necessary support fromthe Trade Unions.      These would have to be encouraged tosettle all possible matters of difference with theemployers by the normal methods of negotiation, but theGovernment must he prepared to intervene on occasion.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed -(a) That the Minister of Labour should discuss with the Minister for Defence Co-Ordinationthe representation of the Ministry ofLabour on some of the Sub-Committees ofthe Principal Supply Officers Committee.(b) That the Minister of Labour should consider what action would he most appropriate and effective for bringing back skilled menwho had emigrated to the United States ofAmerica or elsewhere and who could be usefully employed in the  industriesengaged in carrying out the defence programmes.      If any .question of assistedpassages should arise (which was notanticipated), he should confer with theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs.(c) To take note of a statement by the Ministerfor Defence Co-Ordination to the effect thatcertain manufacturing interests had soughthis advice as to whether they should give priority to orders given on behalf of theDefence Programmes over commercial(including export) orders and that for thepresent he had reserved his position,13.8. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theIfoGRAMMB. 4__ Minister of Labour (CP. 96 (36)), dealing with theg^our labour issues raised by the Defence programme (Cmd.5107).&apos;ssuesivolved. It was axiomatic that civil industry and the export trademust be maintained, and it was feared that - particularlyIrevious in building and in engineering - the supply of skilledReference jQabinet 10       men would prove inadequate to meet Service demands.      It
9.    The Cabinet had. before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for &quot;war (CP. 92 (36)) statingthat recruiting for the Regular Army during the next four years was likely to fall short of requirementsby some 3,350 men a year.      &quot;Wastage by discharge anddesertion was also on the increase.      The most seriousfeature of all would be the shortage of reservists inthe event of mobilisation.      Recruiting for theTerritorial Army was similarly likely to fall short of requirements during the same period by some 14,000a year.      The Secretary of State appealed forauthoritative pronouncements by Ministers on thedanger of allowing the voluntary system to fail.    Inaddition, he appealed for the co-operation of theEmployment Exchanges and Instructional Centres of theMinistry of Labour.The Cabinet had also before them a Memorandumby the Minister of Labour (CP.  102 (36))  in whichthe objections to active recruiting measures by his department were set out.      He was willing, however,to consider the display of additional recruitingposters at Emploj/government Exchanges.      The real fact,however, was that the help which the department would be able to give in connection with the supplyof labour for the Defence programme would be muchmore valuable than any recruiting measures which itwas in their power to take.In the course of the discussion, the Secretarjrof State for War and the Minister of Labourdeveloped their respective points of view as toco-operation between the two Departments in recruiting matters.The Secretary of State for India, referring to,    . the       Governmentparagraph 9 of CP. 92(36), said that/Indian/would do&apos;what was possible to improve barrack accommodation ofBritish soldiers in India but that they were14.
handicapped by fina. oxlconsiderations.    On the one hathe President of the Board of Trade was pressing himto reduce   pertain tariffs from which revenue was drawn and on the other hand provision had to be madefor- financing the new autonomous developments andfor rebuilding Quetta.     He warned the War Officehowever that even when better barracks were provided, there would remain other factors whichtended to render military service in India unpopular,such as the monotony of miliSary life, the absenceof feminine society of the soldiers1 own class, thedifficulty of giving furloughs to this country, all of which objections were perhaps harder to deal withthan the provision of barracks.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the Secretary of State for Warand the Minister of Labour should consist-operate in setting up an Inter-Departmental Committee to include representatives of the Ministry ofLabour and of the three service departments to consider co-operation by the Ministry of Labour in ozjder toassist recruiting.(b) That, in view of the particular importance of the subject,t:.3 reportof the Inter-Departmental Committeeshould, if necessary, be referred toa Cabinet Committee.

The process of removalPreviousReference $ could in no case begin for seme 2\ years.      Y/hen theabinet 25 (36),conclusion 8.)        pivotal men had been transferred there would be a consequent throwing out of employment of semi-skilledpersonnel, to the extent of betv/een 10 and 14 percent,  of the total Factory strength.      Since therewas an annual turnover of employees of between 3 and4 per cent., it was hoped that many of these wouldbe absorbed in the remaining parts of the Factory.The unemployment at Woolwich would of course be offset by the employment created in the new districts.A further point contained in the Secretary ofState&apos;3 Memorandum was the proposal that therecommendation for the removal of the Cordite Factoryfrom Waltham Abbey to Bishopton should be carried outforthwith.After a short discussion, the Cabinet agreed -(a) To authorise the purchase of the land at Bishopton required for the removal ofthe Cordite Factory from Waltham Abbey.(b) That no announcement as to  the removalof &quot;the Filling Factories from Woolwichor the Cordite Factory from WalthamAbbey should, be made before Easter.(c) That, whenever an announcement was made,the Secretary of State for War should ensure that it included a statement tothe effect that later on difficulties would arise in connection with workers who would be displaced and lose theirjobs as well as problems in connectionwith the removal of other workers to thenew Factories;    but that in the intervalthe Government were giving most carefulconsideration to these matters.ft a (d)    That the Committee referred to at the. / previous meeting of the Cabinet mentioned&quot;iofibj &amp; in the margin should be set up after easter.
