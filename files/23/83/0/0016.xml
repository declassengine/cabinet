The Secret&apos;ry of State for Foreign affairs mentioned that as a result of numerous communications between London and Paris during the previous day he had acceeded to M. Flandin&apos;s request that heshould attend a preliminary meeting of the locarno powers to be held in Paris on the following day,Tuesday, March 10th.On Tuesday evening the representatives ofthe Locarno Powers would all leave for Geneva wherefurther meeting   would be held.     He had made clear to M. Flandin that he considered Geneva the proper.place for these conversations.
At the outset of the meeting the secretary of State for Foreign Affairs handed rounda draft of a statement which he proposed to read inthe House of Commons the same evening.  (Appendix I).There was a pause to enable members ofthe Cabinet to read the draft statement, after which it was discussed paragraph by paragraph.As a result of this discussion theCabinet agreed:(a) To approve the draft statementsubject to the followingamendment s:Bage .1,^ para;_1.

ECONOMICPRESSUREON GERMANY..(previous reference:Cabinet 11(34) Conclusion4).2.      The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesas Chairman of the Advisory Committee on trade questions in Time of War reminded the Cabinet of aReport (C. I. D.- Paper No. 1175-B) which had been drawn up in June 1935 and which dealt with thepossibility of bringing economic pressure to bearon Germany, without there being a state of war.As the French Government was reported in the french press to have under consideration making a proposalat Geneva to apply economic sanctions to Germany he proposed to bring the said report up-*to-date.,2, Whitehall Gardens, S. W. 1.,9th March, 1936*
APPENDIX LDRAFT STATEMENT FOR THE HOUSE OF COMMONS-(For statement as approved see Appendix II.)On March 6th I asked the German Ambassador to come and see me at the Foreign Office and I made to him a proposal which His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlin had made to theGerman Chancellor on December 13th last,  and which I myselfhad repeated to the Ambassador on February 27th, that  thePowers Signatory of the Treaty of Locarno should proceedwith the negotiation of an air pact which,  as the Houseknows, has been under consideration for the last year.On this occasion I reminded His Exoellency of the hopeswhich Herr Hitler himself has expressed for the bettermentof international relations in Western Europe,  and I told him that it seemed to me that  the time had now come when a realeffort must be made to translate these hopes into facts, andto attempt to achieve a real improvement in the relations of the United Kingdom, France and Germany.     I pointed out to the Ambassador that the air pact touched what was in some respects a point of junction, and a sensitive point of junction,in the relations of the three great Western Powers,   and i thought that the conclusion of such a pact might constitute a stabilising element in our relations in the Westo     I did not feel that it was really impossible to negotiate suiaha pact even while the situation was complicated by the Italo-Abyssinian war and I asked the Ambassador to communicate withhis Government at once - and I added that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were genuinely anxious to convert to practicalresults    the sentiments so often expressed in speeches.
The German Ambassador came to see me on the morning ofMarch 7th and informed me that he had a communication of verygreat importance to make.  .  He then handed to me a memorandumof which he read to me a translation..      An English text ofthis memorandum is now available in the Vote Office0      I donot therefore propose to give the House a full account of thismemorandum but I  should like to draw attention to certainsalient points in it.The memorandum falls into two parts.      In the first part the German Government have developed  at considerable lengththeir objections to the Franco-Soviet Pact  and the reasons whyin their view the intention of the French Government to concludethis Pact has created an entirely new situation and destroyed the political system of the Locarno Treaty.      The German Govern-ment hold that for these reasons the Locarno Treaty has ceasedin practice to exist and that Germany consequently regardsherself for her part as no longer bound by this no longervalid Treatyo      The memorandum then announces that  the GermanGovernment have restored the full and unrestricted sovereignty of Germany in the demilitarized    zone of the Rhineland.The second part of the memorandum contains a series of proposals which are described as being designed to promote theestablishment of a system of peaceful security for Europe,These proposals are first,  that a demilitarized zone shouldbe created on both sides of the Franco-German and Belgian-German frontiers;    Secondly,  that non-aggression pacts fortwenty-five years should be concluded between Germany,France and Belgium;    and that Great Britain and Italy should
guarantee these pacts;    Thirdly, that the Netherlands might be invited to join this treaty system. Fourthly,  that thesesecurity arrangements should he supplemented by an air pactjFifthly that non-aggression pacts should be concluded between germany and the States bordering Germany on the East similarto the agreement between Germany and Poland,  the exceptionpreviously made in regard to Lithuania being conditionallywithdrawn?    and finally it  is stated that Germany is willing tore-enter the League of Nations, now that equality of rights andthe restoration of her full sovereignty over the entire german territory has been attained&quot;.      In this latter connexion,  theGerman Government express the expectation that in the courseof a reasonable period the question of colonial equality of rights  and of the separation of the League covenant from theTreaty of Versailles may be settled through    friendlynegotiation..On receiving this communication from the German AmbassadorI  told His Excellency that he could not expect me to make any detailed observations on a document of this importance until Ihad had an opportunity to study it and to consult my colleagues on the situation which it created.      At the same time I  toldHis Excellency that  there was one observation which I must makeat once.      I deeply regretted the information which the ambassador had given me about the action which the GermanGovernment was taking in respect of the demilitarized zone.The Ambassador would appreciate that  this amounted to theunilaterial repudiation of a Treaty freely negotiated andfreely signed.     I had a clear recollection of the statement   ......
which the Chancellor had made to me at our first meeting inBerlin on the subject of the Treaty of Locarno, when he had drawn a clear1 distinction between that treaty and the Treatyof Versailles, and emphasised that Germany had freely signed the Treaty of Locarno.      I was aware, I said to the Ambassadorof the view of the German Government as the effect of the franco-Soviet Pact on the Locarno Treaty.      That view was not,however,  shared, by the other signatories,  of the Treaty,  andif the German Government, despite the opinions of the other signatories, still maintained their own conclusion, then therewas the proper arbitration procedure available for their use.I feared that the effect of the unilateral repudiation of this treaty upon His Majesty&apos;s Government and upon British publicopinion must inevitably be deplorable.As to the later parts of the Ambassador&apos;s communicationI said that I would have carefully to consider these, but clearly the declaration in respect of Germany&apos;s attitude towards theLeague was most important.      The Ambassador at this pointinformed me that the German Government1s decision in regard tothe League was due to the     desire of the German Government tomeet the views frequently expressed by the Prime Minister and myself when we emphasised that the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment was based upon the League and upon collective security.      Germany he said, was willing to share in such apolicy, and there were no conditions attached to her returnto the League.     She wished to return now.     While the GermanGovernment hoped that at some later date the Covenant wouldbe divorced from the Treaty of Versailles and Germany given some measure of satisfaction in respect of colonies these werenot conditions but matters for negotiation subsequent toGermany&apos;s return to the League.
As to the later parts of the Ambassador&apos;s conversation,I said that I would have carefully to consider these, but clearly the declaration in respect of Germany&apos;s attitudetowards the League was most important.     The Ambassador atthis point informed me that the German Government&apos;s decision in regard to the League was to a large extent due  to their desire to meet the views frequently expressed by the PrimeMinister and myself when we emphasised that the policy of PlisMajesty&apos; s Government &quot;was based upon the League and uponcollective security,      Germany,  he said, was willing to share in such a policy and there were no conditions attached to herreturn to the League.      She is willing to re-enter the League ofNat ions.     While the German Government expected, that in due timethe Covenant would be divorced from the Treaty of Versaillesand the question of colonial equality of rights settled, these were not conditions but matters for negotiation subject  toGermany&apos;s return to the League.I do not need to emphasise the importance of the communication from the German Government of which I have given  an account.      Similar memoranda have been communicated to theother signatories to the Locarno Treaty, namely Prance, Italyand Belgium.      But before passing on to observations of a more general nature, it may be well for me to inform the House ofthe steps which are to be taken in the immediate future.      a preliminary exchange of views will take place in Paris tomorrowbetween the representatives of the other three signatory Powersand myself when the situation created by the German action willbe explored.  &apos;  These conversations will be resumed at Geneva onthe following day.    Meanwhile, the Preach and Belgian Governments,with the full knowledge and agreement of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have asked that the Council of the League of Nations may be summoned as soon as possible to consider the situation.      TheCouncil will it is understood meet on Friday next.
I have now given the Iiouse an account of recent events together with some comments upon them.      I havealso given the House such details as are in my possessionof the procedure to be follov/ed in the immediate future.But honourable Members will no doubt expect toreceive some immediate indication of the ideas and intentions with which the representative of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment must approach at Geneva a problem., thedevelopment of which is as yet in some important respectsobscure.      It is clearly desirable to do this for no-one can fail to realise the stabilising force of a clear-sighted and united British opinion in the affairs ofEurope at this juncture.Let us not delude ourselves.      The action of theGerman Government in unilaterally repudiating obligationsinto vh ich they had freely entered both complicates andaggravates the international situation.      The abrogationof the Locarno Treaty and the occupation of the demilitarised zone has profoundly shaken confidence inany engagement into which the Government of Germany mayin future enter.      There can be no-one in this House orthis country who would wish to condone or excuse sucha step.      It strikes a severe blow at that principle ofsanctity of treaties which underlies the whole structure of international relations.      To action of such a character this country must be unalterably opposed.It must be obvious to all that in such circumstances the transition from a bad past to a better future will bean arduous and hazardous enterprise.      At the same time we are not merely concerned with the past or the present9we are concerned also with the future.      One of themain foundations of the peace of Western Europe has been cut aways it is our manifest duty to replace it ifpeace is to be secured.      It is in that spirit that we
9 r;&apos;M J Jmust approach the new proposals of the German Chancellor.\7e must examine them clear-sightedly and objectively,,with a view to finding out to what extent they representa means by which the&apos;shaken structure of peace canagain be strengthened.In conclusion, I would add.      This repudiation byGermany of the Treaty of Locarno creates a new situationwhich will have to be considered by the parties to theTreaty.      It is obviously impossible for me at thepresent moment to say anything further as to the mannerin which that situation may be treated.      But there Isone point which I desire to make clear without delay-.There is? I am thankful to say., no reason to suppose that the present German action implies a threat of hostilities     the German Government speakin their memorandum of their &quot;unchangeable longing fora real pacification of Europe&quot;, and express their willingness to conclude a non-aggression pact with france and Belgium.     But should there take place during the period which will be necessary for theconsideration of that new situation to which I have referred? any actual attack upon Prance or Belgiumwhich would constitute a violation of Article 2 of locarno? His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom., notwithstanding the German repudiation of theTreaty? would regard themselves as in honour bound tocome? in the manner provided in the Treaty? to theassistance of the country attacked.      Since the essence,of the Locarno system was mutuality? I add that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would adopt a correspondingattitude in the event of a Trench or Belgian attack upon germany in violation of the Treaty.
U 0In the anxious circumstances of the present time9I feel justified in asking all sections of opinion inthis House for their endorsement of the statement whichI have made and for their support in the exacting andarduous task which now confronts the combined wisdomand statesmanship of the worido
? r: 7STATEMENT FOR THE HOUSE OP COMMONS.(As approved &quot;by the Cabinet on 9th March, 1936).Yes, Sir, the answer is a long one, but I feel sure thatthe House would wish for the fullest possible  information.On March 6th I asked the German Ambassador to come and seems at the Foreign Office and I made to him a proposal whichHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlin had made to the GormanChancellor on December loth last,  that the Powers Signatoryof the Treaty of Locarno should proceed with the negotiation ofan air pact, as the House will recall that such a pact was firstsuggested during the course of the Anglo-French conversationsheld in London in February 1935.On this occasion I reminded His Excellency of the hopeswhich Herr Hitler himself has expressed for the betterment ofinternational relations in Western Europe, and I told him that it seemed to me that the time had. now come&apos; when a realeffort must be made to translate these hopes into facts,  andto attempt to achieve a real improvement in the relations ofthe United Kingdom, France and Germany.      I pointed out tothe Ambassador that the air pact touched wbat was in some respects a point of junction, and a sensitive point of junction,in the relations of the three great Western Powers, and his majesty&apos;s Government considered that the conclusion of sucha pact v/oulcl constitute a stabilising element in our relations in the West.      I did not feel that it was really impossibleto negotiate such a pact even while the situation was complicated by the Italo-Abyssinian war and I asked the ambassador to communicate with his Government at once in this sense - I added that His Majesty&apos;s Government were genuinely
anxious to convert into practical results the sentimentsso often expressed in speeches.The German Ambassador came to see me on the morning of March 7th and informed me that he had a communication of very great importance to make.     He then handed to mea memorandum of which he read a translation.

In the first .part the German Government have developed at considerablelength their objections to the Franco-Soviet Tact and thereasons why in their view the intention  of the FrenchGovernment to conclude this Pact has created an entirely new situation and destroyed the political system of the locarno Treaty.      The German Government hold that for these reasons the Locarno Treaty has ceased in practice to existand that Germany consequently regards herself for&quot; her partas no longer bound by this no longer valid Treaty.      Thememorandum then announces that the German Government haverestored the full and unrestricted sovereignty of germany in the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland.The second part of the memorandum contains a series of proposals which are described as being designed to promote the establishment of a system of peaceful security for europe.      These proposals are first, that a demilitarizedzone should be created on both sides of the Franco-Germanand Belgian-German frontiers;    secondly, that non-aggression
pacts for twenty-five years should he concluded between germany, France and Belgium;    and that Great Britain andItaly should guarantee these pacts;    Thirdly, that theNetherlands might be invited to join this treaty systemjFourthly, that these security arrangements should be supplemented, by an air pact;    Fifthly that non-aggressionpacts should be concluded between Germany and the Statesbordering Germany on the East similar to the agreement between germany and Poland, the exception previously made in regardto Lithuania being conditionally withdrawn;    and finally itis stated that Germany is willing to re-enter the League ofNations, now that equality of rights and the restoration ofher full sovereignty over the entire German    territory hasbeen attained.      In this latter connection,  the GermanGovernment express the    expectation that in the course of areasonable period the question of colonial equality of rightsand of the separation of the League covenant from the Treatyof Versailles may be settled through friendly negotiation.On receiving this communication from the german ambassador I told His Excellency that he could not expectme to make any detailed observations on a document of thisimportance until I had had an opportunity to study it and to consult my colleagues on the situation which it created.    Atthe same time I told His Excellency that there was oneobservation which I must make at once.      I deeply regretted theinformation which the Ambassador had given me about the actionwhich the German Government was taking in respect of thedemilitarized zone.     The Ambassador would appreciate that thisamounted to the unilateral repudiation of a Treaty freely nego-tiated and freely signed.   I had a clear recollection of the statement
2S9which the Chancellor had. made to me at our first meeting inBerlin on the subject of the Treaty of Locarno, when he had drawna clear distinction between that treaty and the Treaty ofVersailles, and emphasised that Germany had freely signed theTreaty of Locarno.      I was aware, I said to the Ambassador of theview of the German Government as to the effect of the Franco-Soviet Pact on the Locarno Treaty.      That view was not, however,shared by the other signatories of the Treaty, and if the GermanGovernment, despite the opinions of the other signatories, stillmaintained their own conclusion,  then, there was the properarbitration procedure available for their use.      I feared thatthe effect of the unilateral repudiation of this Treaty upon his Majesty&apos;s Government and upon British public opinion must inevitably be deplorable.As to the later parts of the Ambassador&apos;s communication, I said that His Majesty&apos;s Government would have carefully toconsider these, but clearly the declaration in respect of Germany&apos;attitude towards the League was most important.

While the GermanGovernment expected that in due time the Covenant would bedivorced from the Treaty of Versailles and the question of colonial equality of rights settled, these were not conditionsbut matters for negotiation subsequent to Germany&apos;s return tothe League.
I do not need to emphasise the importance of the communica-tion from the German Government of which i have given the Housean account.      Similar memoranda have been communicated to theother signatories of the Locarno Treaty, namely Prance, Italyand Belgium.     But before passing on to observations of a more general nature, it may be well for me to inform the House of the steps which are to be taken in the immediate future.The French and Belgian Governments, with the full knowledge and agreement of His Majesty&apos;s Government, have asked that theCouncil of the League of Nations may be    summoned as soon aspossible to consider the situation.      I must emphasise that theCouncil of the League is the proper body for this purpose.      TheCouncil will, it is understood, meet on Friday next and no decisions can of course be reached in advance of that meeting;but an exchange of views will take place in Paris tomorrow betweenthe representatives of the four Locarno Powers, other than Germany, and these conversations will be resumed at Geneva onthe following day.      His Majesty&apos;s Government will be represented at these conversations by the Lord Privy Seal and myself.I have now given the House an account of recent eventstogether with some comments upon them.      I have also given theHouse such details as are in my possession of the procedure to befollowed   in the immediate future.But honourable Members will no doubt expect to receive some immediate indication of the ideas and intentions with which therepresentative of His Majesty&apos;s Government must approach at Genevaa problem, the development of which is as yet in some important respects obscure.     It is clearly desirable to do this for no one can fail to realise the stabilising force of a clear-sighted and united British opinion in the affairs of Europe at this juncture.-
9 fi 9Let us not delude ourselves. The course taken hy theGerman Government in unilaterally repudiating obligations into which they had freely entered and in simultaneously acting asif they did not exist both complicates and aggravates the international situation.    The abrogation of the Locarno Treaty andthe occupation of the demilitarised zone have profoundlyshaken confidence in any engagement into which the Governmentof Germany may in future enter.    There can be no one in this house or this country who would wish to condone or excuse sucha step.    It strikes a severe blow at that principle ofsanctity of treaties which underlies the whole structure ofinternational relations.There is, I am thankful to say, no reason to suppose thatthe present German action implies a threat of hostilities!the German Government speak in their memorandum of their&quot;unchangeable longing for a real pacification of Europe&quot;,and express their willingness to conclude a non-aggression pact with Prance and Belgium.    But in case there should beany misunderstanding about our position as a signatory of the locarno Treaty, His Majesty&apos;s Government think it necessaryto say that should there take place during the period whichwill be necessary for the consideration of the new situationwhich has arisen, any actual attack upon Prance or Belgiumwhich would constitute a violation of Article 2 of Locarno,His majestys Government in the United Kingdom, notwith-standing the German repudiation of the Treaty, would regard themselves as in honour bound to come, in the manner provided in the Treaty, to the assistance of the country attacked.It must be obvious to all that in existing circumstances the transition from a bad past to a better future will be anarduous and hazardous enterprise.   At the same time we are notmerely concerned with the past or the present, we are concerned
also with the future.    One of the main foundations of the peace of Western Europe has been cut away and if peace is to besecured there is a manifest duty to rebuild,.    It is in thatspirit that we must approach the new proposals of the GermanChancelloro   His Majesty&apos;s Government will examine them clear-s ightsdly   and objectively? with a view to finding out to what extent they represent a means by which the shaken structure ofpeace can again be strengthened.    In the present grave conditionof international affairs,, His Majesty1 a Government feel thatno opportunity must be missed which offers any hope ofamelioration^,In the anxious ciroumstances of the present time.  I feel justified in asking all sections of opinion in this House fortheir support in the exacting and arduous task which nowconfronts the combined wisdom and statesmanship of the world.
