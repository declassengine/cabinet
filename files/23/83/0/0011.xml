defence requirements,SECRECY INREGARD to finance.(previous reference:Cabinet45 (35)Conclusion 7)*1*      The Chancellor of the Exchequerrepeated to his colleagues an appeal which hehad made at the meeting referred to in the margin that no Minister should,  in public speeches, make any reference as to how our new aofence programmes were to he financed.The Press was apt to draw inconvenientconclusions often from innocent and distantreferences to the subject such as had beenmade in a speech the previous evening.^      T&quot;**
S.      The First Lord of the Admiralty saidthat up to now he had tried to trouble the cabinet as little as possible with thedifficulties of the Naval Conference.     Now.however, he required to consult them.       TheConference was rapidly approaching agreementbetween the Four Powers remaining after the departure of Japan, on certain technical questions.There were still so^ne difficulties, but agreement was hoped for. Such difficulties as were raised on these technical points came from theHome Governments and not from the Delegations.The real difficulty now, however, was on thequestion of how the agreements were to be registeroOn this the position was somewhat difficult.   ^DheUnited. States Delegation wanted to leave london in March and insisted that they must sign somethingdefinite before leaving. France, on the otherhand, found it very difficult to sign anythingbefore their General Election in May,      Italy said,in effect, that it was difficult for her to signwhile sanctions were in force, though psssiblythis might be got over. In that event, if heceuld induce the Four Powers to sign an agreementwithout involving any promise that other powers should sign it later,  it might be possible to achieve success. The trouble was that a FourPower Agreement was of no use to us unless Germanyand Japan adhered to it, more particularly owingto the danger lest they should combine to actagainst the Treaty, Consequently he wanted to
try another method which had been rejectedearlier,  l*e.  to get the signature of the four powers now and to try and obtain the signature of Germany, Russia and Japan by means of bi-lateralagreements. Germany had been kept informed that all stages of the Conference and might possiblyagree to this procedure, though this could not be guaranteed. It mould be represented to germany that she had induced us to enter into a bi-lateralagreement on quantitative Dimitation andconsequently we were justified In return in askingbi-lateralher to enter a/Treaty on qualitative limitation.If Germany could be brought in on these linesJapan and Russia would also be approached.     Theidea of this plan was to save the French from having to sign a Treaty With Germany before the Elections.It was hoped, however, later to secure a singledocument signed by all the Powers concerned.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs agreed that the procedure proposed above was apossible one* In favour it could be said thatwe should be asking two other Powers besides Germanyto accept a procedure which would avoid thesuggestion that Germany was not being treated on abasis **f full equality,and   oecondlyj     that ageneral agreement could be obtained later.       Thatis to say, the prccedure now proposed was pnly a stage towards a complete Treaty to be signed afterthe French Elections^ If the Cabinet approved the procedure, the next stage would be to approach the German Ambassador and ask him if Germany wculdagree*
Cabinet agreed:That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the First Lord of theAdmiralty should be authorised toproceed on the lines proposed above.
3,      The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs read to the Cabinet three telegramsreceived the same morning frstm His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Tokio (Nos. 5V, 59 and 60) reportinga military qioup d*etat in Tokio involving the murder of the Prime Minister and a number ofCabinet Ministers and officials.

THE ITALO-ABY33INIANDISPUTE: THEPROPOSED oil sanction.(previous references:Cabinet 8 (36)Conclusion 3andCabinet 9 (36)C conclusion 5).5. The Cabinet had before them the following papers bearing on oil sanctions:(l) a Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (CP. 53 (36))covering the Report of the Committee of experts at G-eneva (Cmd. 5094);(2) a Note by the Secretary of St. te forWar (CP.  52 (36)) covering aMemorandum on the military situation on both the Northern and SouthernFronts in Abyssinia.After the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs had made a statement setting forth thepros and cons of an oil sanction and had expressedthe opinion that on balance he thought the Leagueought to agree to impose it, the Cabinet discussed the question at great length, and the PrimeMinister invited elcery member to express his view.The main arguments against the impositionof an oil sanction on Italy may be summed up asfollows:    the sanction would not prove effective;the United States of America certainly could not be relied on to co-operate.      Even if they did there remained the supply from Venezuela (who has neverco-operated effectively in sanctions and depended on oil export for revenue) which is even larger than that of the United States and is ownedfcrthe most part by American companies:.      If allother sources were closed, therefore, Italy could still turn to Venezuela,and it was stated on page15 of the Experts1 Report that &quot;there are notechnical reasons why Venezuelan crude oil shouldnot be sent direct to Italy for refining&quot;.The only limiting factor, therefore, would be theItalian capacity for refining.     Moreover, if oilwas to be dealt with, it would also be necessaryto deal with tanker tonnage, and that involved
many risks, economic as well as political.     Up to now the principal &quot;burden of sanctions had fallenupon this country which was more affected than anyother member of the League of Nations owing to itsvast trade.      The figures for no country&apos;s sacrificecould compare with ours.      The coal export trade fromthis country to Italy had completely disappeared, andby next week 30,000 miners would be unemployed.Debts due from Italy to this country were being held up and private firms were heavily hit.      Italian-british firms of long standing were being broken up, and many people were cutting their losses and drawing out.The business community of this country was bearing the brunt of sanctions.     We had to aim at such a posi tionthat whenever peace was signed between Italy and abyssinia we should be strong enough to recover ourItalian trade and nothing should be done to jeopardisethat,Prom another point of view an objection was raised on the ground that the position of the Fleet inthe Mediterranean was becoming intolerable.    Some seven months ago we had brought it up to war strength withoutmobilisation.      The result was that the leave of largenumbers of the personnel was long overdue and many shipsought to be recommissioned.      Alexandria was a particu-larly bad place from the point of view of the personnel.The First Lord of the Admiralty had hoped that theposition was easing, and had intended to ask at thismeeting for authority to bring home the Commander-in-Chief in the &quot;Queen Elizabeth11 which was- long overduefor relief.     He was mos t anxious to get ships away from the Eastern Mediterranean.      The spirit and morale of the Fleet, it was true, was as high as he could wish,thembut he did not want to try/too highly.       If a capital
libship were withdrawn and paid off it would mean thatwe should only have seven capital ships in commission with three more which could be commissioned at short notice.     Yi/e could not afford to overlook Japan.If the imposition of an oil sanction was to involve aprolongation of the emergency in the Mediterraneanit was much to be deprecated.A third reason against an oil sanction was itsprobable effect on the success of the Faval conference which would be gravely jeopardised.Other - objections to an oil sanction werethe risk of precipitating an extension of the war(which, however, was felt generally to have receded);or that Signer Mussolini might be encouraged to allyhimself with Herr Hitler;    or that he might withdraw from the League and the Locarno Treaty.Politically it was urged that the Governmentshould not yield to &quot;left-wing&quot; opinion.      Gesturesand symbols of this kind were dangerous and to adopt a.non-effective sanction was to get the worst of bothworlds.The commentary on the above objections may besummarised as follows:    even if the sanction did not prove completely effective (a point on which theevidence was generally admitted to be inconclusive)it was bound to add to Italy&apos;s difficulties.      Perexample, if Italy were driven to the American and.Venezuelan markets instead of obtaining oil supplies from Roumania and Russia,  it would add to the expenseand so drain the dwindling gold supply more rapidly.Moreover, Venezuela, in particular, had no refineries andexported for refining purposes to the United States ofAmerica and the Dutoh Colonies.      Italy had by nomeans unlimited refining resources.     As regards
the effect in the United States of America,evidence was produced to show that in the opinionof some competent observers the application of an oil sanction might produce more result than was expected,notwithstanding the forthcoming general election and the attitude of Congress, as a large section ofpublic opinion objected strongly to making profitsout of war.      On a long view it was urged that a failure to apply an oil sanction at the present juncturewould be a fatal blow to the prestige of the Leagueof Nations in America as elsewhere.      If, on the otherhand, the League faced up to its responsibilities,public opinion would be influenced more favourablytowards the League and collective action which wasvery important.      Tanker tonnage,  it was admitted,would have to be dealt with at the same time as theapplication of an oil sanction.      It was contemplated that each member   of the League should prohibitits own tankers from visiting Italian ports.      It wasnot contemplated, however, that there should beinterference with the tankers of non-co-operatingnations.      There was absolutely no question of a blockade.       As regards the burden of sanctions on various countries, it was pointed out that althoughthe aggregate figures for the United Kingdom might be greater than those of any other country, the actualproportion of the trade affected was greater in thecase of some smaller countries, e.g,  in the case of yugoslavia as much as one-third.     As regards the coal trade of this country with Italy, it was pointed outthat it had been virtually dead before ever sanctionswere imposed because Italy could not find means ofmaking payments.      It was suggested that the impositionof an oil sanction would be fair from this point of view
n   1 QI i 6as     it would spread the total &quot;burden of sanctionsto other countries.Much sympathy was expressed with the Navaldifficulties in the Mediterranean, hut it wassuggested that the imposition of an oil sanctionneed not necessarily involve the retention of the&quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; in the Mediterranean.      If the naval situation admitted of It,  it would be a fine gestureto bring home the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; at the moment of applying the sanction.^,- ft&amp;lpa*=*=3^^^e&amp;sibLi^ef^ The riskof an extension of the war was generally deemed to bevery much less than it had been earlier and probablyjto be negligible.      The risk of an alliance betweenjiitaly and Germany was also thought to be small owingto the contempt in which Herr Hitler is believed to- hold- Italy.      The view was expressed that the with-drawal of Italy from the League and the Locarno treaty was also improbable.The positive reasons in favour of the impositionof an oil sanction may be summed up as follows:Although the British Minister at Addis Ababa and theGeneral Staff were not apprehensive of a collapse of the situation in Abyssinia, the telegrams from theEmperor discussed at the meeting of the Cabinet onFebruary 24th (Cabinet 9 (36)Conclusion 5 &amp; Appendix)indicated that the Emperor himself (who, however, was reported by the Military Attache to be a -very tired man)was getting anxious.      If these telegrams were published in a last effort to secure support from the league and nothing had been done, we should cut a poor figure.Even more importance was attached to the reaction of a
negative attitude on the future of the Leagueof Nations itself.      The effect would he very toadin Germany, the United States and in this country.Any nation contemplating aggressive action would heencouraged and the disturbance to the world wouldtoe greater than ever.      For eighteen countries tomeet and decide to do nothing would from thispoint of view &quot;be most detrimental and discouraging,especially to countries applying sanctions.The whole principle of collective security would toeput in question.Great importance was attached to the reactionwhich a negative attitude,aa outlined above,would have on the political situation in this country.      the carrying out of the programmes of Defence Bequire-ments depended very largely on industrial mobility-thesation, and for this/co-operation and good will of labour was essential.      The Trade Unionistsection of the Labour Party stood firmly for collective security, and if the application of an oil sanction was shirked by the Government, theopposition to the Government1s defensive programmes would have a moral basis which at present it lacked.In fact, the application of an oil sanction wasadvocated on the ground that it might even enablethe co-operation of Trade Unionists to be secured.In particular,  it was urged that the position wouldbe very difficult next week when the white paper was introduced if our representative at Genevahad just declined to co-operate in an oil sanctionSome members of the Government who had littleconfidence in the efficacy of the sanctionsupported it on the ground that it was impossibleafter all that had been said at the General
Election and before and since not to try out apolicy of economic sanctions *    Our own country andthe whole world were entitled to know whether theycoaid be made to work.      To repudiate an oil sanctionafter the statements that had been made in the debate on the Hoare-Laval peace proposals would be politicallydisastrous.aAnother argument in favour of/sanction   wasthat the Dominions were for the most part anxiousto see it applied (though the Australian HighUuiti a foe ftt*^ aft&amp;Commissioner was believed to be an exception).,   Therejhad been a tendency particularly in Canada, to lookI upon the United Kingdom&apos;s foreign policy with suspicion^to--romove--.-thls-.      The South African High Commissioner wa(reported to be strongly in support of the applicationI of an oil sanction;, though it was pointed out that south Africa had shown no sign of withdrawing hersubsidy from an Italian shipping line that wascompeting with the British lines.Prom the point of view of the military positionin Egypt, the -Secretary of State for War reportedthat the situation was now much more satisfactory.There was general agreement that we should avoid taking a lead in this matter at Geneva, and thatthe affair should be so conducted that the Committee of eighteen in its corporate capacity should take it;also that there would be no question of applying an oil sanction unless the other oil producing or exporting countries co-operated, though it would not be necessaryto hold up the whole plan in consequence of non-co-operation by Venezuela.
The Prime Minister said that he attached sohadgreat an importance to this decision that he/Wished toknow the view of everyone of his colleagues.     he agreed . in   the general view that an oil sanctionought now to he imposed.      In this respect his view had changed owing to the altered political circumstancesof the day.      Politically he thought Tils own position as Prime Minister would he much affectedaccording to the decision taken.     Although the questionof prestige was of no account to himself personally,undoubtedly the prestige of the Prime Minister affectedthat of the Government.      For the reasons that had beengiven a refusal to impose an oil sanction would have a disastrous effect both now and at the next GeneralElection.      During the late General Election the feeling of the country had been in favour of trying out theLeague system, though he himself had made quite clearthat he would never agree to anything in the nature ofa blockade.      The losses involved in the oil sanction would be part of the price for expediting asettlement,   but the whole of Europe was entitled toknow whether collective economic sanctions isould workso that every country could make up its mind as to howin a collective system,far it could co-operate/     The attitude of theDominions was also important, and he gathered that they also wished to try out the policy of economic sanctions.Were they convinced of that policy&apos;s success, they might be more amenable to co-operation in the Empire for maintaining the peace of the world.      He also attached the utmost importance to the labour side of the questionwhich was af vital importance to the Defence Requirementsprogrammes.      In that respect the totalitarian states had a great advantage over &apos; this country. Therefore,
o 90  programmes were to oe carried out.      With that co-operation this country in five years time wouldfear no-one.The Cabinet agreed;-(a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs at the meeting of theCommittee of Eighteen fixed for Monday,OA &quot;U^    )       March 2nd, should he authorised to agree&quot;liT^/janj       to^the imposition of an oil sanction on\ii 1 )       Italy.(b) That he should endeavour to secure its application at as early a date as othermembers of the Committee of Eighteenwould agree to.(c) That he should take advantage of urgingan early date for the application of the oil sanction in order to obtain post-ponement of coxisideration being given toa shipping sanction.(d) That the co-operation of other membersof the League which were producers,exporters or carriers of oil was essential,  though it would not benecessary to hold up the sanction forVenezuelan co-operation.(e) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should as far as possible avoidtaking the lead in this matter atGeneva, that is to say, it should beleft to his discretion to carry out thepolicy of the Government with as littlepublicity to himself as possible.(f) That the Defence Policy and requirements committee should meet at 10, downing street on Tuesday next, March 3rd,at 11 a.in. to consider the proposals ofthe First Lord of the Admiralty for bringing home Naval personnel and units,and any points wnich the Secretary ofState for Air might desire to raise.The President of the Board of Trade asked thathis dissent might be recorded to the impositionof an oil sanction.The First Lord of the Admiralty asked that hisdissent might also be recorded on the groundthat no sanction ought to be imposed which wasnot likely to prove effective, a view which he understood had been held in the past by manyof his colleagues and by the Cabinet itself.
gpORT DUTIES 6.      The Cabinet had before them the followingU GERMAN and austrian GOODS, documents, dealing with recommendations submittedby the Import Duties Advisory Committee in October(previous last for the increase of the United Kingdom dutiesReferences.Cabinet 5 (34),       on certain kinds of felt hats and hat shapes and on conclusion 18,and Cabinet 39 certain kinds of dressed leathers-(34), Con-clusion 4.) A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (CP. 58 (36))pointing out that the proposedincreased duty on felt hats, etc.,would particularly affect the exporttrade of Austria, and asking for areconsideration.      If the recommenda-tion were rejected, the declared policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government toassist in the political and economicrehabilitation of Austria might begiven as a reason.A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (CP. 59 (36))pointing out that the proposed increasedduty on dressed leather would particu-larly affect the export trade of Germany,and asking for a reconsideration.      Ifthe recommendation were rejected, thespecial conditions governing Anglo-German trade, which required themaintenance of German exports to thiscountry, might be given as a reason.A more important reason, though onewhich it would be undesirable to mention, was the Secretary of State&apos;scontemplated effort to reach a Europeansettlement in agreement with Germany.Memoranda by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP. 60 (36)) and thepresident of the Board of Trade(CP. 61 (36)) pointing out that, inview of the long delay since the receiptof the Advisory Committee&apos;s recommendations,a rejection would be difficult to explain to British traders on commercial grounds.Any attempt to do so on political groundswould be dangerous.      On the other hand,  itwould be desirable to avoid futuredifferences of opinion between the ForeignOffice and the Advisory Committee,  andarrangements for consultation between departments and the Advisory Committeenow existed.
The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to theimportant political objections to the increase recommendedby the Import Duties Advisory Committee of the importduties in question,summarised in CP. 58 (36) and cp, 59 (36) respectively.      In this connection specialemphasis was laid on the desirability of maintainingunimpaired our well-known and declared policy to assist in the political and economic rehabilitation of Austria.As regards Germany, the Cabinet were warned that,inthe opinion of His MajestyTs Ambassador in Berlin, theproposed increase of duty on dressed leather might have aninflammatory effect in Germany and might lead the germans to suppose (quite wrongly) that we were going to indulge in a policy of pinpricks.      This, in Sir E. Phipps&apos; view,might possibly lead to some retaliatory act on Germany&apos;part.On the other hand, the Cabinet were informed that german exports of dressed leather were subsidised by theGerman Government to the extent of about 33 per cent,  ofthe value.      In addition, the German exporters were forcedby reason of Germany^ exchange difficulties andnecessities to sell abroad at any price that they could get.     The combination of these factors was having theeffect of driving the British producers out of business,and failure to give effect to the Export Duties AdvisoryCommittee^ recommendations would be certain to provoke a storm of acute criticism and resentment.The Cabinet; agreed  To adopt the views expressed by theChancellor of the Exchequer and thePresident of the Board of Trade inPapers CP.  60 (36) and CP. 61 (36)respectively, namely that the re-commendations of the Import duties advisory Committee dated 2nd October,1935 and 14th October, 1935, respect-ively, regarding the increase ofUnited Kingdom import duties -
(l) on certain kinds of felt hats andhat shapes; and (2) on certain kinds of dressed leather, should he accepted.
7.     The Cabinet had before them the Report of theCabinet Committee on Tithe Rent charge (CP. 49 (36))..to which was appended the Report of the RoyalCommission on this subject;    and also the draft ofa statement of Government policy (CP, 49A (36)).intended to be presented as a Command Paper sir/ml-taneously with the publication of the Commission&apos; sReport.      The Commission&apos;s Report was now some threemonths old, but its publication had been delayed.The reason was that the Cabinet Committee had foundthat the scheme contained in the Majority Report wasincomplete, while that contained in the MinorityReport was unacceptable.      The Cabinet Committee hadbeen compelled to amplify the recommendations of theMajority Report in two important directions :-(a) The compensation of the Local authorities for their prospective loss of rates;    and(b) The compensation of the Church of england for its prospective loss of income.In general, however, the Cabinet Committee had followed the Majority, the fundamental principle of whose scheme was the extinguishment of the presentliability of the tithe-payers through the payment bythe latter of a series of redemption annuities;these annuities were to be collected by the State(through the Board of Inland Revenue), which in turnwould become responsible for the interest and sinkingfund on the new stock to be given to the tithe-ownersin exchange for their existing rights.The conclusions and recommendations of theCabinet Committee are set out in paragraph 24 oftheir Report;    and for convenience of reference are reproduced in the Appendix to this Report.
The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries reminded the Cabinet of the recent history of the tithe situation,and summarised the recommendations of the Report of theRoyal Commission and the proceedings of the CabinetCommittee which had examined that Report.      As pointed outby the Cabinet Committee in their Report, the RoyalCommission had failed to xaa&amp;e provision for two importantliabilities, namely (1) the claim of the Rating authorities for compensation on account of the loss of tithe rentchargeas -a rateable hereditament;    and (2) the cost of adminis-tration and&apos; collection of the new redemption annuities.If the first of these liabilities had been thrown on theLocal Authorities, an increase of rural rates,ranging from1/- in certain counties to 8/9d.  in $ther counties, wouldhave been necessary.      It was imperative, therefore, tohold up the publication of the Report of the RoyalCommission while this important matter was being discussed with the Local Authorities, with whom a satisfactory settlement had now been reached.Discussions nad also taken place with the ChurchAuthorities,as a result of which it was proposed that inaddition to the amount of capital stock allocated to QueenAnne&apos;s Bounty under the Royal Commissions proposals, a lump sum payment of  2,000,000 should be provided,to beused at the discretion of the Church Authorities to mitigate the hardships which would otherwise be suffered by the poorer clergy.      While, under the scheme,  the tithepayerwould not receive as good terms as he no doubt wanted, thepresent proposals were, so far as the tithepayer was concerned, a great improvement on the proposals of theBill of 1954.      He (the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries) had reason to believe that the tithe payers wouldnot take^serious objection to the change in the method-20-
ef recovery as they had taken in 1954, and their mainobjections to the new scheme would be that itsfinances would be unduly strained by the concessionsmade to the Local Authorities and the Church,and the extension of the -redemption annuityperiod from 40 to 60 years.      It was not possible, at themoment,  to say whether the tithe payers would accept the new-scheme,  but on the whole it seemed probable that they wouldnot press their objections to the point of wrecking thenew proposals, &amp;cu*-c^A aAaU-, fit LJwUd a^CLu^  iCftUultThe&quot;attention of the Cabinet was drawn by TheChancellor of the Exchequer to the draft Statement of Policy(Paper No. CP. 49A.(36)), and in particular to paragraph 24of that Statement which had been inserted after circulation of the draft to the Cabinet Committee.      The object of the paragraph in question was to warn titheowners and. tithe-payers that the Government might find it necessary toprovide in the proposed legislation that the futurestatutory provision for the voluntary redemption by tithe-payers of the annuities payable under the new scheme   will apply retrospectively to any redemptions effected betweenthe date when the scheme   is. published and the appointed day.In the course of     discussion the Cabinet were warned that the proposals would be attacked and criticised, bothby the tithe payers and the titheowners.      While the ChurchAuthorities v/anted a settlement of this question, they wouldcertainly not accept what was now contemplated as a fair and reasonable solution.The Cabinet agreed  (1) To accept the conclusions andrecommendations of the CabinetCommittee as set out in paragraph 24 oftheir Report  (Paper No.  CP. 49 (36))and reproduced in Appendix     to these conclusions.
To approve the Statement of policy by His Majesty&apos;s Government in theform set out in C.P. 49A.(36)(subject to any necessary drafting alterations).To authorise the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries to arrangefor the publication forthwith of tneReport of the Royal Commission, andthe si ultaneous presentation toParliament of the Statement of policy as a Command Paper in the formapproved by the Cabinet.
POSED INQUIRY0 WORKINGSS EXPENDITURE^VISION OPBASIS OF THEICIAL COST-LIVING INDEX)leviousJference.foinet 8 (36),Inclusion 9.)8.   At a previous discussion on this subject, theCabinet had given general approval to the Ministerof Labour&apos;s proposals contained in his earlierMemoranda (CP. 11 (36)  and CP. 19 (36)), Includingthe maintenance of continuity between the presentindex number and the suggested revised series.     TheCabinet had felt some difficulty, however, regardingthe necessary preliminary inquiry into working classexpenditure, which would also involve inquiries on questions of nutrition.      One suggestion had been to announce the proposal as a whole, but not at present to mention the inquiries into nutrition.      Anothersuggestion was to postpone the inquiries into nutritionThe Cabinet had invited the Ministers mainly concerned to give further consideration to the problem.The Cabinet had now before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Labour (CP. 55 (36)) reporting theresult of these investigations!    the conclusion of theMinisters concerned was that the inquiry, thoughprimarily for the purpose of the cost-of-living index,should cover the whole field and should be institutedimmediately.     Any separate inquiry into questions of   jnutrition was thought likely to create the maximum of difficulty.     The Memorandum contained drafts of a parliamentary announcement and of terms of reference for the Advisory Committee which would be required.The Cabinet agreed.-(1) To approve the conclusions reached by the Minister of Labour, theMinister of Agriculture andFisheries, the Minister of health and the Secretary of State forScotland as set out in paper cp. 55 (36).(2) In particular, to concur in theview that an inquiry primarily forthe purpose of the cost-of-living index should be institutedimmediately and should be announced by means of a reply to a question in the House of Commons as proposedin paragraph 5 of CP., 55 (36).
