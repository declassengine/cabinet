WELCOME TOTHE SECRETARY OFSTATE FOR DOMINIONAFFAIRS.1*    The Prime Minister, on behalf of theCabinet, welcomed the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs on his return from hissuccessful election campaign.
ivLiNCE 2.    The Cabinet had before them the following, QUOTATION.&quot; paperss-- ous A ^emoran(3-ura- ty &quot;the Secretary to theIf rence: Committee of Imperial Defence, circulated&apos;efS Pt6*(36), &quot;b-Y direction of the prime Minister,! elusion 1)* (CP. 30 (36)), in which it was pointed&apos;cn &apos; out that the present proposals for a minister of Defence were open to ther.j? objection of divided control, and thatqhy)l) similar arrangements which had been tried&apos; in the past had not worked well inpractice.      Substantial progress in defence -ordination had been made in recent years,and the existing machinery had worked wellduring the Italo-Abyssinian crisis.A Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff,circulated by direction of the PrimeMinister,  (CP. 36. (36)),  in which it was stated tnat many of the suggestions whichhad appeared in the Press had beenill-informed.      Close touch already existed between the Prime Minister andthe Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committees    andthe appointment of a civilian Chairmanwould hinder rather than assistco-operation between the Services.      Theproposal for an independent Joint staff was unsound, since the drawing up of plansmust rest with those who are responsiblefor carrying them out.      Some advantage,however, might be obtained if the joint planning Committee were reinforced by theappointment of an assistant to each of its members.A Memorandum by the Secretary of State forAir (CP. 37  (36)), who considered that! compromise in order to avoid difficultieswas not unknown under the present system,and that there was a case for the appoint-ment of a Minister to act as Deputy Chairmanof the Committee of Imperial Defence, and as chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee,and to take charge of the supply organisation.There would also be advantage in a smallcombined staff whose work would be submittedto the Chiefs of Staff acting together.A Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP.  38 (36)), in which theopinion was expressed that it was difficultunder present arrangements for the headsof the three Services to take a completelyobjective view of the relative importanceof the part to be played in operations byIII those Services.     An inquiry into thewhole subject appeared to be necessary.i
The Prime Minister said he had hoped to dispose of the first item on the Agenda Paper, namely,Defence Requirements, at to-day&apos;s meeting, but hethought the discussion on our needs should be preceded by the Cabinet giving come consideration to Friday&apos;debate in the House of Commons.        It was clear that parliament was now taking a lively interest in imperial Defence and the organisation concerned with it. There had been no vicious attack and hethought if properly handled it might be possible towork very closely with Parliament on this subject..There was much, for example,  in the Speech of the leader of the Opposition, with which he was himself in agreement.There was general agreement that the Speech inthe Debate which had best crystallized the views ofthe House of Commons was Sir Susten Chamberlain&apos;s.This    obviously had made a great impression and carried a large measure of assent.There was a general agreement also that the debate had made it difficult to set up an outsideinquiry to investigate the question.        The Minister-without Portfolio, who had spoken at the Debate onbehalf of the Government,  reported that the generaltenor of discussion was an expression of extremeanxiety.       Most of the ideas that had been suggested for reform were wrong, except those of Sir austen chamberlain. There appeared to be a general feeling at the back of peoples&apos; minds that theChiefs of Staff Committee had become almost anobstruction to co-ordination and a desire to replace the Chiefs of Staff Committee.      He thought the Houseexpected the appointment of some Minister directly responsible for the Committee of Imperial Defence.*-** 55 -
Other members of the Cabinet reported somewhat similar impressions.       There was a feeling, they said.that the Chiefs of Staff Committee only reached agreement by compromise and not a unified, agreement.      The criticswanted a Minister who could discuss matters with theChiefs of Staff Committee and come to conclusions onan organic unified system of defence.        The mereinjection of a politician into the Chiefs of staff committee was not enough.       Something more organicwas required to remove the impression that the Chiefs ofStaff Committee sat together but that all the work was,thatdone in the Department sj       in other words,/they were nota staff working together.The Prime Minister pointed out that the work on thedefence side of the G-overnment&apos; s activities hadenormously grown.        It was difficult for a Prime Ministerto do it effectively though he had done his best to compete with it.       The question arose therefore as towhether there should not be a Minister who gave his whole time to the Committee of Imperial Defence, and had   nothing else to do.       He thought that would satisfy the House ofCommons and that they would be content to leave a Ministerto work out his own plan.        He thought it was very important at the appropriate time to reply to the many veryunfair   things    that had been said about the present organisation. This war; the first constructive measurementioned in the discussion.A second suggestion in the direction of a constructive measure was that a Minister was requirednot to take the Prime Minister1s place, but to take chargeof the Chiefs of Staff Committee, not with a view toover-riding it or deciding between conflicting views butto get the best out of the Committee,  and that in addition
there should be some organisation at the Committeeof Imperial Defence on the lines of the Military-Advisers at Versailles in 1917-18* This organisa-tion must work in subordination to the Chiefs ofStaff Committee, since it was the Services who hadto carry out any proposals that might be approved.This body, therefore, would work through theChiefs of Staff Committee to the Minister.    &apos; Inaddition, a Minister should be brought in to assistthe Service Ministers on the Supply side.It was pointed out to the Cabinet, however,that the speakers in the recent Debate had beenwrong on innumerable points and that no one at all had done justice to the work of the Chiefs of staff committee which, in fact, had done extremely welland had never failed to produce joint appreciationson any subject. The criticism came mainly fromdisgruntled politicians supported by retiredofficers, who were not up-to-date.       The fact was that up to only six months ago no one lad takenmuch interest in defence and if the situation&apos;was now unsatisfactory it was due to the neglect of advice of the Defence Ministers and Departments.As usual, the blame was being put on the wrongpeople.The Cabinet were reminded that the presentsystem had grown up during seventeen years ofneglect of defence.       Nevertheless, when thatera had come to an end it had responded extremelywell to the present needs of the situation asillustrated by the Abyssinian crisis. the criticisms in CP. 38 (36) were in reality notcriticisms of the Defence Requirements Committee- 5 -
but of the Air Ministry.       No Minister of Defence wouldhave been likely to be able to change that situation.Much emphasis was made on the danger of dividedresponsibility.        If a Minister were appointed asDeputy Chairman of the Committee of Imperial defence and Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, for whatwould he be responsible ?     For strategy ?    Or, was heto decide the number of ships, for example ?     If so, hewould be sharing responsibility with the First Lord ofthe Admiralty.       Both his powers and his work   wouldbecome too great for any man. Then as to supply -how, it was asked, was it to be fitted in ? It was hoped to obtain the collaboration of Lord Weir on theSupply Question - but not as a Cabinet Minister.        It was difficult to see in the matter of Supply where the lineof demarkation and responsibility was to be drawn.      Itwas strongly urged, therefore, that there should be nopanic concession to an ill-informed Debate and that before anything was settled there should be an enquiry by Ministers to consider what was wrong,  if anything,with the present system, how it could be improved and how the chain of responsibility was to be defined.The Lord President of the Council, as a formerPresident of the Chiefs of Staff Committee and as Chairmanof many Committees on which they had worked,   said he hadnot found the Chiefs of Staff Committee work in theframe   of mind of the parliamentary critics.       Hethought the question required very careful thinking-out  .by a Cabinet Committee before any decision was taken.The situation might be urgent but it did not requirepanic decision. The erroneous idea that nothing hadbeen done in recent years and that the system ofco-ordination is totally ineffective must be removed.
A Minister, as Deputy-Chairman, might be useful butthe important point was to define his responsibilities,otherwise great trouble might arise.The Minister of Labour laid the utmost emphasis on the vital importance of the handling of labour asa factor in the problem of the re-conditioning of theForces.        Difficulties had arisen in connectionwith the Air Force Programme in providing for thenecessary skilled and. semi-skilled labour.        For thenew Programmes the labour problems had required to bemuch more carefully thought out than had been done upto the present and the Ministry of Labour ought to bebrought into immediate contact and co-operation withthose responsible for the carrying out of the programmes as finally decided.The Cabinet were informed that while muchignorance had been displayed in the Debate the motivepower had probably been supplied by Lord Trenchard,Lord Milne and probably some serving officers.      Apartfrom ministerial co-ordination there was also a demand. for an Improvement in the Committee of ImperialDefence.        The suggestion to project a Minister intothe Chiefs of Staff Committee was criticised by several members of the Cabinet on the ground, for example, thatit would diminish the collective responsibility andco-operation of the Chiefs of Staff Committee.It was recalled that the Chiefs of Staff committee did not themselves favour a Ministerial Chairman andit was suggested that collaboration would probably inpractise be weakened if this course were taken.The proposals of the Chiefs of Staff themselvesin   strengthening the Joint Planning Committee(CP. 36 (38),  paragraph 17) were criticised as being- 7 -
insufficient to satisfy parliamentary opinion ifproceeded with on the right lines.        It wasnecessary to make the Joint Planning Committee a continuous organisation working under the Chiefs ofStaff Committee, but not confined entirely to the subjects referred to them by the Chiefs of staff committee. The Joint Planning Committee shouldhave a right of initiative to the Chiefs of staff committee. The Committee ought, it was suggestedfto include offiaersfrom the &quot;Q&quot; side of activity.The officers should be of senior rank to those proposed by the Chiefs of Staff Committee and should in all cases be graduates of the Imperial DefenceCollege.,The Cabinet were reminded, however, thatin the last resort the decisions depended uponMinisters. A Committee of Public Servants,such as the Chiefs of Staff Committee were perfectlycompetent to work out what was required, provided they received political instructions from Ministers.The essential point was the co-ordination of the objective and that was the work of the Cabinet,Another suggestion was that criticism was directed less against the actual machinery than     &apos; itsdirection.      As an extreme example,  the case of aircraft versus battle-ships was quoted.    Whatmeans existed at present, it was asked, to judgebetween the claims of the Admiralty and Air Ministryrespectively on this and similar issues? &apos;Several members of the Cabinet suggestedthat there should be a Ministerial Inquiry,    In that
event,  it was urged very strongly that it should workvery rapidly.The Cabinet agreed:(a) that the time had passed when an outsideinquiry would be useful;(b) that they must reach their own con-clusions as soon as possible, and withthis object a Cabinet Committee shouldbe appointed composed as follows:The Prime minister the Lord President of the council the Chancellor of the exchequer the Lord chancellor the Home secretary the Secretary of State for foreign affairs the First Lord of the admiralty the Secretary of State for WarThe Secretary of State for air the Minister of labour the First Commissioner of works the Minister without Portfolioto consider the question of Co-Ordinarionlof Defence in the light of the Debate inParliament on Friday, 14th February,1936,  and the Cabinet discussion andreport their conclusions;(c) that the above Committee should meet at10 Downing Street on Tuesday,  18thFebruary, 1936,  at 11,00 a.m.
THE ITALO-abyssinian dispute.((Mediterranean(previous reference:Cabinet 6  (36)Conclusion 5).Measures.i.3.      The Secretary of State for Air reminded theCabinet that the measures taken to meet the emergency in the Mediterranean had been as follows:(i) Increase of the establishment ofcertain units abroad.(ii) The sending auroad of additional squadronscomplete.(iii) The dispatch of personnel overseas inorder to increase Staffs, to increase thestrength of maintenance units,  to formnew maintenance units ana to makereinforcements available on the spot.(iv) The preparation of the maximum number of squadrons at Home which could be usedeither in the South of Prance or north africa after mobilisation.      This hadentailed keeping personnel with these squadrons who would otherwise have been withdrawn in connection with the expansionscheme or overseas drafting.A stage had been reached in the expansion programme when the maintenance of some of the abovedispositions threatened to handicap it.Consequently, he had agreed with the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs that the time had come whenthe squadrons at home, referred to in (iv) above,might be released, and personnel might be withdrawnfrom abroad who were only necessary if we must beprepared for hostilities at short notice.The First Lord of the Admiralty recalled thathe also had made representations as to the difficulties that were arising owing to the maintenance of numbersof men-of-war in the Eastern Mediterranean, and he was anxious to withdraw the Commander-in-Chief in theMediterranean.      He asked for an early meeting ofthe Defence Policy and Requirements Committee toconsider the matter.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said it was very difficult to assess the political- 10 -
situation in the Mediterranean at the moment, andnext week, when the oil sanctions question would arise,  it might he serious.      There was the dangeralso that Italy might succeed in her aims.      He hoped to circulate an appreciation of this subjectbefore very long.The Cabinet agreed:-(a) To approve the proposals submittedby the Secretary of State for air in agreement with the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, as summarised above,(b) That as soon as the appreciation ofthe situation in the Mediterranean bythe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs was available, a meeting ofthe Defence Policy and requirements committee should be held to considerthe Memorandum presented by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty.
