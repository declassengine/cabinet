GERMANY ANDTEE locarno treaty.   &apos;^previous reference:Cabinet 2.3 (36)Conclusion 1).1*      The Cabinet had before them and took note of the following documents:A Report by the Chiefs of Staff SubrCommittee on the military aspects of theproposal to send British troops as partof a possible International Force to the rhineland (CP.. 81 (36)).A provisional Report by a Sub-Committeeof the Advisory Committee on Trade questions in Time of vVar on the subject of economic pressure on Germany (CP. 85 (36)).Shortly before the meeting the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs had circulated a copyof a despatch, dated 24th March, to His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Berlin describing an interview with herr von Ribbentrop, covering a copy of a notedelivered by the German emissary on the previous evening (CP.  89 (36)).The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs gave the cabinet the latest information as to thenegotiations with Germany.       The German reply wasnegative on all the proposals of the Locarno Powers rother than Germany,  though Herr Hitler had promised?a &quot;final and important document&quot; for next week      which was intended to enable us to co-operate in settling the problems of the European Continentfor all time.&apos; The reply, however, gave no helpduring the difficult interim period prior to thenegotiations with which we were now faced.     TheGerman Government did not appear in the least torealise that by a unilateral breach of the locarno treaty they had created an entirely new situation.Turning to the period immediately ahead,including the Debate to take place in the House ofCommons next day, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that the fundamental point was to
arrange a meeting of the Locarno Powers.      It was,however, necessary to gain time so that negotiations should he postponed until after the Prench Elections.In the circumstances, he proposed:-(i) That it would he very difficult to holdup any longer the despatch of the letterto he addressed to the Prench and belgian governments (Gad. 5134/1936, page 7).(ii) That in the Parliamentary Debate on thefollowing day he should emphasise the first paragraph of Section III of the proposals to Germany (Cmd. 5154, page 1) to theeffect that nothing that has happenedbefore or since the breach of the Treatyof Locarno can be considered as having freedthe Signatories of that Treaty from any oftheir obligations or guarantees.(iii) That we should also agree to carry out the,second half of Section III which providesfor Staff conversations, with a view toarranging the technical conditions in whichthe obligations which are binding upon the locarno Powers should be carried out incase of unprovoked aggression.(iv) To ask Herr von Ribbentrop if he himselfmight say in Parliament that the GermanGovernment have no objection to the staff conversations.(v) To ask Herr von Ribbentrop whether theGermans, who had mate no contribution to thesolution of the immediate difficulties,would undertake not to construct fortifications-tions in the Demilitarised Zone during thenext few months.The discussion which followed revealed a large measure of agreement with the proposals of the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, as summarised above,with the exception of No.  (i).     On this the general view of the Cabinet was that it would be better to postpone sending to the French Government the letterafterreproduced on page 7 of Cmd.  5134 until/ the parliamentary debate.       It was suggested that if the French Govern-ment, who were anxious for the letter to be sent, should press for this before the Debate, they might be reminded that Italy was to send an identic letter, and
that it might he convenient if Prance could arrangefor the Italian letter to he sent at the same time as our own.       On the whole, however, it was thoughtadvisable that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should, if possible, avoid seeing the french ambassador before the Debate took place.In connection with the letter ,   the cabinet were reminded that under paragraph 1 (c), France andBelgium were bound in return for the letter to givereciprocal assurances for the purpose of ensuring thesecurity of this country against unprovoked aggression.This, it was suggested, appeared to envisage an exchangeof letters.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs suggested that our letter need not necessarily be delayed -until the French Government had given their reciprocalassurances, but our undertaking under paragraph 1 (c)would not be valid until such assurances had beenreceived.One suggestion was that it might be wiser inthese circumstances not to ask for the reciprocalassurances at the time of giving the letter.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out that the despatch of the letter could notbe delayed much longer for, as intimated in thefirst paragraph, it was supposed to be sent&quot;at the moment when the representativesof Belgium, France, Great Britain andItaly have just decided, as provided into-day&apos;s arrangement, the common lineof conduct of their respective Governments&quot;,The discussion on the letter extended over thewhole field of the proposals to Germany and, moreparticularly, the attitude thereon of public
9 ^ QsJ 5 0The Cabinet were reminded that both inParliament and outside there was a good deal of anxietyon the subject which had been considerably increased byM. Flandin&apos;s speeches.     The great mass of publicopinion appeared to assume that we had no commitments on the Continent and did not realise the extent of theobligations we had already assumed under the Treaty of locarno.      It was suggested that it would be necessaryfor the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to trace historically the origins of our existing commit-ments beginning with the Treaty of Versailles, and showingthe extent to which we were alreaay bound.      He wouldthen be able to bring out that^/our commitments had actually been lessened by the proposals in theWhite Paper.One difficulty that had to be met was the Frenchclaim that the proposals were &quot;indivisible&quot;, and thatGermany must take them as a whole or leave them.      Theincorrectness of this assumption, the Cabinet were reminded, was proved by the heading v/hich began &quot;text of Proposals drawn up by etc.&quot;, and further by the factthat the French had agreed to alternative proposals in respect of the proposed occupation of the demilitarised zone which would be offered to the German represen-tative if the original proposal was rejected.      It was stated that the French had tried to introduce the word&quot;indivisible&quot; but our representatives had neveraccepted it.       The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, therefore, would be justified in saying thatthroughout we had taken the vie?/ that these wereproposals.The Cabinet were informed that the main anxietyof public opinion was their belief that we had enteredinto some new military alliance, or that M-&apos;Flandin and . van Zeeland regarded the new arrangements as a
*&quot;l l*J Amilitary alliance - as stated by the Marquis of Lothianin the House of Lords on the previous afternoon.(Parliamentary Debates, House of Lords, Col. 204).It was pointed out that the reply to this.was tobring out the historical facts as suggested above, andto emphasise that the proposed military conversationswhether in Section III of the proposals, or in paragraph1 (c) of the letter, were to provide only against&quot;unprovoked aggression&quot;.      In the latter case alsowe should get reciprocal assurances.      Moreover, ourposition was fully safeguarded by the provision inparagraph 1 (a) of the letter that the steps to be takenwere to be decided &quot;in consultation with&quot; His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, and by paragraph 1 (b) oy which we would come to the assistance of tne other Governments only&quot;in respect of any measures which shall be jointlydecided upon&quot;.      The situation, therefore, was animprovement on the Locarno Treaty.There was general agreement that the military conversations provided for in Section III of theproposals were a binding commitment.The Cabinet were also reminded that althoughunder Section III, first paragraph, of the proposalsit was stated that recent events had not freed the signatories of the Treaty of Locarno from any of their obligations, that was only applicable to the presentand not to some future arrangement.Another point on which it was suggested that public opinion would wish to be reassured was thatthere was no risk of our being drawn into war or placedin a position reflecting on our willingness to fulfilour obligations by the Franco-Soviet Pact.The question was raised as to what would be theposition if conciliation should break down through the
action of France and not of Germany.     The identicletters had been intended to provide for the case where conciliation failed owing to German action,and in some of the early drafts that had appeared inthe text.     For diplomatic reasons, however, referenceto Germany had been left out.There was general agreement that if conciliationfailed owing to French intransigience v/e should retain our freedom.The view was strongly urged that opportunityought to b e taken of the forthcoming Debate to enlightenpublic opinion which was assuming that Germany was the&quot;white sheep&quot; and not the &quot;black sheep&quot;.     It waspointed out that the German Governments reply to theproposals of the Powers (CP. 89 (36), page 2, last 2paragraphs) had intimated that the Locarno TreatyThewas a forced Treaty.    /British public ought to be reminded that the Locarno Treaty, which had been drawnup shortly after the occupation of the Ruhr by France,had been not only agreed voluntarily by Germany, but had inured to her advantage.     Furthermore, it oughtto be impressed on the public that our present difficulties were entirely due to a breach by germany of this voluntarily accepted Treaty and that so farshe - had made no contribution to the solution of thedifficulties.     Another idea which ought to becombatted was the prevalent one that the occupation ofthe Rhineland was no threat to France.     It was a threat because so long as the Rhineland was demilitarisedthe Germans, in order to invade France through Belgiumas in 1914, would have to use large forces to hold the rhineland and their striking force would be reduced.After occupying the Rhineland they could fortify it,3.hold the frontier with/relatively small force, and- 6 -
greatly increase their striking force on the northernbank.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the general lines of thestatement made by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, as set forth onpage 2 of these Conclusions, viz:(i) That he should emphasise in the debate that nothing that has happened before or since the breach of the Treaty of Locarno can beconsidered as having freed the signatories of that Treaty fromany of their obligations orguarantees and that the lattersubsist in their entirety.(ii) That the General Staffs should be instructed to enter into contact with the French and Belgian General Staffs with a view to arranging the technical conditions in whichthe obligations which are binding upon t hem should be carried out incase of unprovoked aggression.(iii) That Herr von Ribbentrop should beasked y/hether the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs might say we Parliament that the German Govern-ment did not object to the proposedStaff conversations.(iv) That Herr von Ribbentrop should alsobe asked to give some Kind of undertaking that the German Govern-ment would not construct fortifications-tions in the Demilitarised Zoneduring the next few months;but that(vj The letter to be addressed to therepresentatives of Belgium andFrande should not be sent until after the Parliamentary Debate, and,if possible, the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs should avoiddiscussing the matter with the french ambassador until after the Debate.(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should, after the Debate, do his best to hold the position as at presentuntil after the French General Elections.
THE ITALO-AiY5SWIANDISPUTE. &quot;(previous reference:Cabinet 25(36)Conclusion 3)*2m      The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that M. Madariaga, the Chairmanof the League of Nations Committee of Thirteen, andthe Secretary-General had been asked to find out theposition of the Italians and Abyssinians towardsthe negotiation of peace. Abyssinia at presentwanted the Italians to withdraw from their presentpositions before negotiations took place.       Theattitude of the Italians also appeared to be somewhatunsatisfactory.
ANGLO-EGYPTIANTREATYNEGOTIATIONS.The protectionof Foreigners.(previous reference:Cabinet 21(36)Conclusion 8).3,     The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs gave the Cabinet some account of the treaty negotiations which were not going very well andhad not yet passed out of discussions on themilitary provisions.       In the circumstances, theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs did not ask for a decision on the questions raised in hisMemoranda CP. 71 (36) and CP. 78 (36).The Cabinet agreed:That the Chiefs of Staff Committeeshould be asked to examine andreport their views on the counter-proposals made by Nahas Pasha.
99 jei 0fcpLOYMENT OFKfPRUSTV/ORTHYPERSONS IN THEIpPARTMENTS.[(previousiRef erence.Jcabinet 84 (31),Conclusion 3(E))./J4,       The Cabinet had before them a most secret memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty(CP. 82 (36))  calling attention, in connection withcertain recent cases of sabotage in the dockyards,to the existing rules for the elimination ofdisaffected civilian employees from the service ofthe Defence Departments.      These rules, which hadbeen laid down in 1927 (Cabinet 35 (27) Conclusion 1)and confirmed in 1931 (at the Meeting referred to inthe margin), were as followss-/ it(a) persons who can be shown by reasonableevidence to be actively engaged in the dissemination of anti-constitutional and revolutionary propaganda, eitheroral or written, should be dischargedforthwith and without pension or othersuperannuation benefit %(b) Persons who merely label themselves asCommunists without taking any active part in the furtherance of Communismshould be eliminated as and when oppor-tunity offers,  i.e., by discharge onreduction.&quot;These rules had been found inadequate in severaldirections and it was now proposed, with theconcurrence of the other two Defence Departments andof the Treasury,  to adopt new rules as followss-&quot;In any case in which there is reason tobelieve that any employee of a defence department has been, is, or is likely tobe engaged in activities endangering the safety or interests of the State, immediateenquiry into all the relevant circumstancesshall be made by a Departmental committee consisting of the permanent Civilian Headof the Department, the EstablishmentOfficer and a representative of the Treasury.If the Committee is satisfied that the case is made out,  it shall so report to theCabinet Minister of the Department with a recommendation for the man&apos;s immediatedischarge.In the event of such a case being challengedin Parliament, the Cabinet Minister would inform the House that he has satisfiedhimself as to the facts of the case but thatit would not be consistent with the publicinterest to go into further details.&quot;
The proposals of the service ministers as set forth in CP. 83 (36) it wasgive    a Service minister pointed out would, in effect,   /  something approaching absolute power as to the dismissal of a civilian employe subject to the reportof a Departmental Committee. While it was recognised that the Trades Unions concerned and the mass of the workers much resentedthe acts of sabotage that had taken placethey were apt to guard jealously the privileges, especially of established employes..The Cabinet invited the Minister forCo-Ordination of Defence to examine theproposals set forth in CP, 82 (36) in concert with the Ministers concerned and to reportto the Cabinet.
*5 o r*I.I MEMORIALI TO THE1 late admiralI op the fleet&quot;earl beatty,I (previous Reference:1 Cabinet 51(35)I Conclusion 11).5*     The Cabinet agreed:To approve a memorial to thelate Admiral of the Fleet EarlBeatty and that the Prime minister should take the appropriatesteps.(The First Lord of the Admiralty left the meeting at this point).
CORONATION. 6.     The Cabinet had before them the following papers:leyipusTerence:61 met 17 (36)conclusion 5).A Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council(CP. 67 (36) )dealing with the date of the Coronationand the procedure by which the preparations for aCoronation are initiated.A Report from the Cabinet Committee set u;o at themeeting referred to in the margin (CP. 76 (36).The Committee&apos;s recommendations we e as follows(i) That, subject to His Majesty&apos;pleasure,  the date of the Coronationshould be Whit Monday, May 17th, 1937,..and that the State Procession throughLondon should take place on Tuesday,May 18th, 1937.(ii) That, subject to (i) above, Monday,May 17th, 1937, should be declared byOrder in Council a Bank and public holiday in Scotland, and Tuesday, May18th, 1937, should similarly be declared a Bank and Public Holiday inEngland, Wales and Northern Ireland.(iii) That His Majesty should be advised that the general procedure preparatoryfor the Coronation outlined in theooening paragraphs of CP. 67 (36)should be followed: vis.  the setting up under the Privy Council of a coronation committee and a Court of Claims.(iv) That, subject to the views of the earl marshal, the Executive Committee ofthe Coronation Committee should beprovided with a small Civil ServiceSecretariat.The Lord President of the Councilinformed the Cabinet that since the CabinetCommittee had reported in favour of the Coronationdate being Whit Monday, 1937, with a public and bank holiday in England and Wales on thefollowing day, information had been receivedfrom the Ministry of Transport as to difficultieswhich these dates would occasion to the railways.Sea-side places were also reported to be adversely affected. For the moment, therefore,he would not ask the Cabinet to fix the actualdate but only the month in which the Coronation
should take place, on which an early decision was of great importance* This would be inaccordance with past precedent and wouldenable the preliminary submission to be madeto The King and the machinery to be set in motion for the appointment of a coronation committee of the Privy Council, in accordancewith the usual procedure,to make all necessaryarrangement s *The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs hoped that the decision as to the monthmight be provisional,pending consultation withthe Dominions. In communicating with theDominions he would propose to emphasise thatthere were very strong reasons for the Coronationtaking place in May and he had no reason to anticipate an unfavourable reply.The Cabinet agreed:(a) Subject   to   The King&apos;s approvalthat the month of May, 1937,should be fixed for the Gorona-tion.(b) That the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should informthe Dominions of this proposal.If there should be some over-ridingreason which made it impossiblefor any of the Dominions to agree,he should bring the matter backto the Cabinet.(c) That the Cabinet Committee should meet again to make proposals as tothe date in May.( 0.) That the necessary machinery should be set in motion for theappointment of a coronation committee of the Privy Council etc.in accordance with the usualprocedure.
y IMPERIALppSRENGE.PviousIference:iinet 17 (34),biiclusion 4).7*    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs(CP. 77 (36)) recommending that the next ImperialConference should be held at or about the timeof the Coronation:    that the Dominions should beasked by telegram whether they would agree to ameeting at that time:    that a similar inquiry should be addressed to India, but that the concurrence of the Dominions would be necessary before an invitation was issued to Southern Rhodesia, whosestatus should no doubt once more be that of an observer.      No action was necessary as regardsNewfoundland.The message to the Dominions ought to containsome indication of our tentative views concerningthe agenda which should certainly include foreignpolicy and defence, and, if possible, migration.It was desirable to prevent the Conference fromassuming an economic character.      The discussionof trade questions would in practice meancontroversy and bargaining over the Ottawa Agreements,and, it was suggested, might more appropriatelytake place, on a suitable occasion, with each dominion separately than at a Conference on theoccasion of the Coronation.The Secretary of State for India warned the Cabinet that by the date proposed for theImperial Conference it was probable that Burma,as well as India, would be entitled torepresentation.The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs promised te give very careful considerationto a proposal by the Chancellor of the Exchequer
that some opportunity should he found at theImperial Conference to review any bi-lateralagreements on trade questions that might havebeen concluded.The Cabinet agreed:To authorise the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs to propose to the Dominions by telegram that the next ImperialConference should be held at or about the time of the Coronation.
9 (Hsi JIstablishment0f a Legislativecouncil.previous reference:Cabinet 1 (36),Conclusion 8).^*(36)73^ The cabinet had. hefore them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for the Colonies(CP.  87 (36)) stating that the Labour opposition in the House of Commons wished to debate on thefollowing day the Government&apos;s proposal to establish a Legislative Council in Palestine.      Afterdetailing the occasions on which they had considered this matter in recent years, the Secretary of Stateinvited the Cabinet to give a final endorsementto the proposal.The Secretary of State for the Coloniesstated that he had circulated his memorandum on theassumption that the Parliamentary Debate would takeplace en Thursday., March 26th.       As a matter of fact it had taken place instead on the previous day,when strong opposition had been offered against theproposal to establish a Legislative Council inPalestine at the present time.      &apos; An earlierDebate in the House of Lords had produced asimilar result.When he had assumed his present office hehad realised that this question was going to presentgreat difficulties and had telegraphed to the HighCommissioner with a view to securing some delay,but the High Commissioner had given very strong reasons against it.In the course of a short discussion it wassuggested that the criticism had been directed, n^tso much against the establishment of a LegislativeCouncil but against its being done at.the presenttimei
5   &amp;The Cabinet agreed:(a) To take note that the Secretary *state for the Colonies did not askfor a decision that day; that hehad telegraphed to the HighCommissioner the position asresulting from the parlimentary debates and invited his views;and that he might have to raise thequestion again and possibly ask .for a Cabinet Committee on thesubject at an early date.,     Further,that he proposed to ask lord lothian to withdraw the motionwhich he had put down in the Houseof Lords for discussion next week.(b) To take note that the Secretary ofState for the Colonies would accede to the wish of the first commissioner of Works that telegramsrelating to Colonies and mandated territories might be circulated inthe same way as Foreign Office and dominions Office telegrams.

At the meeting referred to in the margin the Cabinet had considered this earlier Memorandum and had agreed-(a) That the Report of the Committee on the admission of Women to the Diplomatic and consular Services should be published!(b) That when the Report was published it shouldbe accompanied by a statement that theGovernment accepted the conclusions of themajority.in regard to the diplomatic service, namely, that the arguments againstthe admission of women to that Servicedefinitely outweigh those in favour, andhave accordingly decided to make no changein the existing position!    and also theconclusions of the majority in regard to the consular Service, namely, that it would be inadvisable to admit women to this Servicepthe statement in question to set out theGovernment&apos;s reasons for these conclusions!(c) To request the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to prepare and circulate to the Cabinet for consideration thedraft of the statement to accompany theReport of the Committee when published.It was recommended in the present Memorandum(CP. 56 (36)) that this conclusion, which for various reasons had never been acted upon, should now be putinto effect, and the draft of a statement for publica-tion with the Report was attached.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the proposals of theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs as set forth in CP. 243 (34) and summarised above.(b) That the text of the draft statement(CP. 56 (36) enclosure) should bediscussed between the Foreign Officeand the Treasury before it was made public.
