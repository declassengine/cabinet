Unless the announcement was qualified as proposed the Government might be placed in an embarrassing position should Parliament introduce amendments into the proposed legislation in such a way that effect would no longer be given toall the provisions of the Convention.With regard to the difficulties in the way of full ratification of the Convention referred to in Memoranda CP. 53 (24) and cp. 106 (24), the Committee were unanimously of opinion thatthe Government should ratify the Convention without anyreservation or qualification.The Committee were informed that, while there was reasonto believe that the Government of the Commonwealth ofAustralia would not support the opposition to the convention of certain Australian trade interests, that Government ought, asa matter of courtesy, to be notified of the British government&apos;s decision respecting ratification before the decision is actuallypublished.The Committee agreed to recommend to the Cabinet (1.)
