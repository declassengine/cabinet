The Cabinet were informed that theTreasury had recently approved an advance to unskilledmen varying from ls06d.  to .    The Secretary of Statefor War said he had satisfied himself that the wages ofthese skilled workers were very low, and there was evidence to show that in many cases they were below the rate paid byother employerso   He proposed,  therefore, that the WarOffice should be authorised to grant an increase of 5ac6d.a weekcThe Cabinet were informed that the proposed increase,if granted, would react on employees of other Departments,and more especially on the Admiralty, which might be-involved to the extent of  600,000 a year, in addition tothe  120^000 a year involved in the War Office proposal.They were also informed that hitherto th-.-; Government had always adhered to the standard rates of wages, and thatin the view of the officials of the Ministry of Labourthere was a special necessity not to depart from this atpresent,  as negotiations were likely to be begun at an earlydate between the Amalgamated Engineering Union and theemployershad themselves authorised an increase above the standard rate, the impartiality of the Ministry of Labour, if calledupon to mediate, might be put in question.The Cabinet felt that, in view of the possible reaction of the War Office proposal on other Departments, the questionrequired further exploration, and agreed -(a) That the Lord Privy Seal, the Secretaryof State for War and the Secretary ofState for the Colonxes should meet therepresentatives of the skilled men at woolwich in friendly conference andshould discuss with them the questionof submitting their claim to arbitration by the Industrial Court (as contemplatedIf, before this negotiation, the Government

Three issues in regard to Singapore were before theCabinet.The First Lord of the Admiralty raised., as a matterof urgency, the attitude he was to adopt in the House ofLords the following day, when Lord Balfour had announced his intention of interpellating the Government as to theirpolicy towards the proposed naval base at Singapore.   LordQhelmsford had been given to understand that Lord Balfour&apos;sobject in raising this question was to place on recordhis own views before going abroad at the end of the week,rather than to elicit a statement by the Government.   he himself had told Lord Balfour that the views of theDominions were not yet available.   Since then, however,the replies of the Dominions had been received, thoughthe reply from India was still outstanding.Lord Chalmsford also raised a second question, whichhad been submitted to him by the Civil Lord and Parlia-roentary Secretary of the Admiralty, as to whether anadditional expenditure of  15,000 ought not to be incurred on winding up the preliminary work on the new base, since,unless this were done, the full value of the expenditurealready incurred in borings, etc., would not be availablein the event of the work being resumed at some future date,either with a view to the establishment of a naval base ora commercial harbour.The third question before the Cabinet was a suggestion by the Governor of the Straits Settlements that the ImperialGovernment should reimburse the actual amount paid by theColony for the land required for the Singapore base, orthe difference between that sum and,what can ba obtained byre-alianating the land (Paper CP.-178 (.24), Wo.VIII).The Cabinet agreed  (a)  That the First Lord       the admiralty should be authorised to Inform the Houseof Lords that the question of the proposednaval base at Singapore was still underconsideration by the Government, and should
seek to obtain the adjournment of the debate until Tuesday, March 18th, or such date as might be selected for thediscussion on Singapore in the Houseof Commons:(b) That the replies from the Dominions .(which were handed round at the meeting in C.Fo-178 (24))  should be considered at the next Meeting of the Cabinet&apos;.(c) That their   previous decision in regard to the limits of. the expend!-ture to be incurred in winding up thework already commenced on the naval base -See Cabinet 16 (24),  conclusion  (f))Should be adhered to:(d) That in regard to the land purchased inconnection with the Singapore base theSecretary of State for the colonies should be authorised to inform theGovernor of the Straits Settlementsofficially that the Imperial Governmentwere prepared to reimburse the localGovernment for any loss which the lattermight sustain through the purchase of theland;    and that at the same time he should send a confidential telegram to theGovernor asking him not to alienate theland for the present, and that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would be preparedto pay the Colony interest on the expend!-ture on the land so long as it was held.
