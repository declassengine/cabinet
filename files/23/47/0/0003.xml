The Prime Minister, as Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, informed his colleagues of the reasons which had(previous       led him, in accordance with what he knew was the general reference:Cabinet 8    view of the Cabinet, to recognise the Russian Government(24), Con-elusion 10./Immediately and without calling a special Meeting to con-sider the question.    Two motives had actuated him.   First,he had found that if he delayed matters to consult other powers it would involve a postponement of three months.Second, he had learned that the representativeCongress of Soviets of..the Union of Soviet Socialist Republicanism-dispersedlies/on Saturday, February 2nd.    By giving recognitionbefore this meeting it had been possible to secure accept-ance not merely by M. Chicherin and the officials of theForeign Office at Moscow, but by the representatives of the soviets of all the Russias, who had in fact sent a verycordial telegram of acceptance (Mr Hodgson, Mo.12, February3rd.)The Cabinet approved the action of the Prime Minister&quot;&quot;,as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in effeoting aI recognition of the Russian Government and securing Its accept-ance by the Second Congress&apos; of the Union of Soviet socialist republics (Telegram to Mr Hodgson, Moscow, No. 16, of
February 1, 1924), and offered their congratulations onthe promptitude with which it had been accomplished.
PAItLIAMENT 2. Arising out, of the discussion on the question ofAND FOREIGNPOLICYo the recognition of Russia, the Cabinet considered briefly the question as to whether, as a&apos;general rule, theGovernment should not submit large questions of foreignpolicy to Parliament before taking action.After a short discussion it was agreed  (a) That in the present case, as there hadbeen the special grounds for urgencymentioned by the Prime Minister (SejeConclusion l), and as two political parties out of three had included the,   de jure recognition of Russia in their programme of electoral policy, there could be no question of tire right ofthe Government to take action:(b) That the general question could moreconveniently be considered when theCabinet discussed their attitude towardsthe Treaty of Lausanne (gee later Con-elusion 16 ).
MINISTERS&apos; 3. The Cabinet had before them a Note by the PeimanentSALARIES.Secretary to the Treasury, giving particulars of the poolingarrangement adopted in 1917 in regard to Ministers&apos; Salaries,IPreviousI Reference:   the purposes of the Government Hospitality Fund, and theI Cabinet 8(24), Con-   arrangements for the upkeep of Ministers&apos; official resi-conclusion  2.)dences and servants (Paper CP.-42 (24)), as well as a Reportby the Select Committee of the House of Commons on the remuneration of Ministers, 1920 (Paper C..P.-42-A (24)).The Cabinet agreed  (a) That, in view of the fact that the salaries of Ministers are voted by Parliament, thedecision as to what these salaries shouldbe ought to rest with Parliament, and,consequently, that there was no object insetting up a&apos; Cabinet Committee further toconsider the question:(b) That the Treasury, after consultation withthe Ministers occupying official residences,should consider whether more equitable andconvenient arrangements could not be madein regard to the upkeep and maintenanceof those establishments.
OTEIPLOYMENT      4.    The President of the Board of Trade, as chairman and .HOUSING.       of the Committee on Unemployment and Housing, made a stated&apos;&apos;&apos;ment in regard to progress.    The Committee were working at(Previous      high pressure, and hoped, after consideration of the ReportsReference:Cabinet 8     of their Sub-Committees on Unemployment and Housing respec-(24), Con-conclusion 7.) tively, to settle their Final Report on Thursday, February7th.    The Report on Housing, however,, would be ready on thefollowing day (February 5th.).  .The Cabinet were informed that the Minister of Labourand the Minister of Health had arranged to see representa-tives of the Building Trade Employers Federation and TradeUnions on Wednesday at 10 a.m., and it was desirable, ifprogress was to be made in regard to the provision of theadditional labour required for Housing, that the ministers concerned should have some general instructions before themeeting.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That before schemes for expenditure inconnection with Unemployment and Buildingcame before the Cabinet, the Treasurymust have an opportunity of considering      ...them in their financial asjjects:Cb) To hold a special Meeting on Wednesday,February 6th, at 3 p.m. , &quot;when the main question for consideration should beHousing:(c) That at their meeting on Wednesday, theMinister of Labour and the Minister ofHealth should ask the representatives ofthe Building Trade Employers1 federation and Trade Unions what steps they could take to xorovide the necessary increase in labour on alternative assumptions, suchas the building by the Government of100,000,    150,000 or 200,000 houses.
AGRICULTURAL      5. The President of the Board of Agriculture and policy.Fisheries, as Chairman of the Cabinet Committee on agricultural Policy, gave the Cabinet an advance summary(previous reference:   of the recommendations his Committee proposed to make in cabinet 8(24), Con-   regard to Agricultural Policy.   Their suggestions includedelusion 6.)the following:-(I) Regulation of Agricultural Wages:(ii) (a) Enquiry into agricultural oondi-tions, etc. , by County agricultural committees and Special Investigators:(b) Enquiry into the methods of dealingwith the xrarketing conditions desoribedin the Reports of the Linlithgow Com-mittee:(iii) (a) Schemes for the better utilisation of the Agricultural Credits Act, 1923:(b) Loans to Bacon Factories, Creameriesand Marketing Societies already approvedby the Treasury.The Committee, however, wished to postpone making its recommendations as to the full policy until it hadreceived the suggestions of a number of experts with whom it was in communication.   For the moment, any announcement should be confined to recoimaerelations which they were ina position to make definitely.    The Committee had enquiredinto the possibility of a development of the transport ofagricultural produce by parcels post, but had encountereddifficulties.    They were in communication with the Ministerof Transport in regard to a Conference on Railway Facilities.They hoped to be able to rake progress in three spheres of activity:-   first, labourers  wages,, to which the Governmentwas committed5.   stimulating the provision of allotments;housing;   and assistance to schemes of drainage and villagewaterworks:   second, in the matter of co-operation:   and,  .&apos;third, by the development of County Committees, to whom it was hoped to give the ta.sk of making a survey ofagriculture within their Counties, coupled with efforts to
arouse public interest in cultivation, and, more particularly,in British agricultural produce.   Proposals on the above lines would be cheap in comparison with any subsidy.    TheCommittee recognised that the regulation of wages involvedsome risk of dismissals of labourers, but the officials ofthe Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries thought this risk to be slight, and palliatives for this might be found in theprovision of drainage works, the control of middlemen&apos;s&quot;rings&quot; and the increased consumption of British-grown foods.There was no idea of a subsidy in connection with the regu-lation of wages.The Cabinet agreed  To invite the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries to prepare, for the use of thePrime Minister in connection with his statement of Government Policy in theBouse of Commons, and of the Lord chancellor and the Lord President of the Council inanswering enquiries in the House of Lords,a statement setting forth:-(i) The proposals of the Committee forimmediate action:(ii) The method in which it was proposed todeal with the regulation of wages, e.g. ,by legislation or,alternatively, by trade boards:(iii) The further suggestions and enquiries which they were following up.
VALUATIONAM) RATINGREFORM.(previous reference:Cabinet 3(23) , Con-conclusion 1.)6.
