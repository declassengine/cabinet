APPENDIX II.SUPPLIES OF MEAT,  UHEAT AKD FLOUR. ^NOTE BY THE PRESIDENT., BOARD OF TRADE.In the absence of any means of procuring direct informa-tlon as to stocks, these figures have been supplied bySir Gordon Campbell as representing the Meat Importers of GreatBritain,, and Mr, Hut chins on, the President of the KationalAssociation of British &amp; Irish Millers.HEAT.     The approximate    stocks of frozen beef, mutton and lambin Lor..dc.ti and Liverpool at the present time are as followsLondon. Liverpool. . Total.Tons.                 Tens. Tons.Mutton                              1,750                 1,100 2,850Lamb                                 3,600                 1,000 4,600Beef                                _650 6506,COO                  2, POO&quot; 8,100In addition there may be small quantities at Manchester,Glasgow, Cardiff, Bristol, Hull, etc but these are negligible.On the assumption that motor transport is availablefor the delivery of these supplies from the stores to the retail shops, there is enough meat in sight to meet thenormal consumption in Greater London for a week.      It isthought that, under a system of informal       rationing, thisporiod could be doubled.The same considerations apply to Liverpool, on theassumption that rather more home-killed meat will be avail-able there. .As regards the big provincial towns,, however, thesituation is more serious.      There is very little frosenmeat In stock, and there v;ould be no spare meat which couldbe railed from London-or Liverpool.     They would have to fall back on supplies of homo-killed moatf which are naturally short at this time of year, end on pork andbacon, which Is in more plentiful supply..-1- /WHEAT
mi?HEA&apos;J? AND FLOUR.      The contrast between London and provincial .supplies Is peculiarly   marked in respect of wheat and &quot;flour.Generally speaking, supplies throughout the poultry are short,as recent imports have been from. America, where the exchangemakes the price high,  and supplies from other quarters willnot be available for the next two or three weeksa     At this time of year, too, home supplies are practically negligible.The normal consumption of flour, expressed in terms ofwheat, in this country is 450*000 quartern a week.     Theaverage Importation during the last two months has beenroughly about 250,000 quarters.     The quantity which has comeinto London has been in the neighbourhood of 120,000 quarters;so that it will be obvious that the amount in the rest of GreatBritain is very small.      London millers have supplies availablefor something like four or five: weeks.      In the North ofEngland, it is stated that there are not supplies availablefor more than three or four days.     This leaves out of account the supplies in the bakers1 shops, which must be taken at fromten to fourteen days,  at any rate in most placesa      In extremecases,  this marked inequality of distribution &quot;might be remedied by railing flour from one quarter to another.4i:4 fcj13th February,. 1921.-.
