The Exchequer contribution would form.,a-, ,higher percentage of the total than at present, but therewould be a diminution in the total amount contributed.Attention was drawn to the fact that the inclusionof juveniles between the ages of 14 and 16 would bring inan annual income of  1,500,000, and that the total expendi-turs on benefits to juveniles from 14 to 16, on the shareof the expenses of the administration, and on the contribu-tion to the cost of Juvenile Unemployment Centres, would only be  550,000.    It was explained, however, that thejuveniles would from the first be accumulating theirunemployment benefit and would therefore obtain individualadvantages as well as participation in an improved schemeof Unemployment Insurance derived from this lowering ofthe age of entry.The Cabinet agreed  To authorise the immediate circulation toParliament of Unemployment Bill No.2 and unemployment Bill No .3.(The Secretary was instructed to telephone this information to theMinister of Labour, in order thatthe Bills lid.ght immediately be released.)

RSNG.1 RE- 4. The&apos; Cabinet had before them the reeoratuendationsSTRICT!ON.of the 0.02i2aittee of Home Affairs in regard to the   -Bent(Previous     and Mortage Interest (Restrictions) Bill, 1924 (H.A.C. 8Reference: x^Cabinet 22 (24), Conclusion 2.) and a Note by the Secretary, coverinw(24), Con-clusion 7.)a proposed amendment to the Rent and Mortgage Interest( Restrictions) Bill as well as an outline of the Parlia-mentary Position, prepared by the Lord Privy Seal (paper cp.-245 (24)).The Prime Minister informed the &apos; Cabinet that on thes previous evening he had held an informal meeting withI those of his colleagues who would be principally concernedin dealing with the question of Rent Restriction in theHouse of Commons, with a view to preparing proposals forconsideration by the Cabinet.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Prime Minister should announce in the House of Commons that if the SecondReading of the Rent and Mortgage Interest(Restrictions) Bill was passed, the Govem-msnt wouiu iaove an amendment to Clause 1,which would then read as follows.:-&quot;iibwithst an&amp;ing m^tMiig in the sectionwhich by section four of the Rent andMortgage Interest Restrictions Act, 1923,is substituted for section five of theprincipal act (which substituted section is in this Act referred to as section five),a court shall not make or grant an order orjudgment for the recovery of possession ofa dwelling-house to which the principalAct applies, or for the ejectment of thetenant there:., rom on the ground of non-payment of rent in any case where itappears to the court that the non-paymentis due to the inability of the tenant toobtain employment, unless the court is satisfied&quot; that the, tenant has bad a re a son-able^ opportunity&quot; of apoli/ing to&apos; the local&apos;1&apos;Poor&quot;&quot; Law Authority for rellefy^ar^.&apos; the&apos;Authority has&quot; had an opportunity; o&apos;f cp -sxderan.g any such IxoTilicatx-on.&apos;1^ &apos;(The new words are underlined.)(b) That the spokesmen for the Government inthe Parliamentary Debate should be authorisedto state that,if the Bill were passed, theGovernment would take such administrative
action as might be necessary to securethat Boards of Guardians in England andWales, and Parish Councils in Scotland,when granting relief to unemployed persons, should take rent into consider-ation:(c) That the Government spokesmen in the debate should resist all idea of aState grant to Local Authorities forthe purpose of carrying out Clause 1of the Bent and Mortgage Interest(Restrictions) Bill, and should takethe line that the relation of local to imperial taxation is a separate questionwhich cannot be dealt with in relationto tliis or any other particular Billbut must be considered as a whole.   Inthis connection it should be made clear to the House of Commons that the pro-posals of the Government in regard to unemployment Insurance, which include a20 per cent, increase of benefits andthe abolition of gaps, will result in thegrant of additional benefits to theunemployed estimated at  10,000,000per annum and that these changes cannotfail to reduce the expenditure of boards of Guardians and Parish Councils by anamount far exceeding any additional burdenresulting from the obligation which theGovernment propose to place upon LocalAuthorities of Including in relief whichthey grant to the unemployed a specificitem in respect of rent:(d) That the Division on the Second reading of the Bill need not be regarded as aquestion of confidence.   In the event ofan adverse vote the Government would accept the decision of the House andthe Opposition Parties   would accept responsibility for their action beforepublic opinion:(e) That the Prime Minister, the Secretary ofState for the Colonies and the Secretaryfor Scotland should be prepared to speakin the Debate, but that the order inwhich they should speak should be leftuntil the Debate had begun.
togfDGOVERNMENT 5. In connection with the discussion on the Rent aridHOUSINGESTATES.       Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Bill, 1924, the FirstEviction       ConimLs sioner of works read to the Cabinet a Memorandumof Tenants.(Paper CP.-242 (24)) In regard to a particular case,typical of liany on the housing estates under his charge,which was of special importance in view of the provisionsof the above Bill.    The case in question concerned thetenant of a Government-owned house who was seriously inarrears of rent, who was unemployed, whose case had been before the Court (which had granted an Eviction Order),but who up to the present time had not been evictedeven though his record was a thoroughly bad one.The Cabinet agreed  That the matter was one for decision bythe Department, but that, on general principles, if a tenant1s record was abad one, an Eviction Order should beallowed to take its course, subject tosuch warning as the Depardmient, havingregard to the circuiustances of the case,might think it desirable to Issue.
CABINET 6. In connection with the discussion on the Rent and procedure. - .Mortpare Interest (Restrictions) Bill, 1924, the question0(Previous     was raised as to the adequacy of the Cabinet procedure for reference:Cabinet 7   ensuring that Government measures were discussed in a(24), Con-clusion Insufficiently critical spirit before introduction In Par-liament.In the course of the discussion it was pointed outthat, subject to one exception, the procedure laid down by. the Cabinet had been followed in the case of the Rent andMortgage Interest (Restrictions) Bill, 1924.    On Tuesday,March 25th, the Cabinet had discussed a Memorandum by theMinister of Health which had been circulated on the previous evening, and the general principle   had been approved.The draft Bill had been circulated to the Cabinet on the afternoon of March 27th and had been discussed on the- following morning at the Committee of Home Affairs.    Inthe ease of both the Cabinet and the Committee of HomeAffairs, therefore, the relevant papers had only been circulated on the evening preceding the discussion. At theCommittee of Home Affairs only two of the regular members,besides the Chairman,   had been present, and these had not included either of the Law Officers.   Moreover, owing tothe pressure of Parliamentary business, the Bill had been circulated to Members of Parliament before the recomiisnda-.tions of the Coiiimittee of Home Affairs had come before theCabinet for approval.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary should arrange to meetthe Law Officers and the Chief ParliamentaryDraughtsman, and should ask them to suggest  .some improvement in the present procedure,(^) with a view to having all Government Billsexamined from a critical point of view,preferably by a lawyer who was also apolitician, before introduction in Parliament,
INDUSTRIAL       7. The Cabinet had before them a Note by the MinisterCOURTSAMENDMENT   of Labour (Paner CP.-222 (24)) covering the IndustrialBILL.m Courts AHjendiiBnt Bill, introduced by Lord Askwith in the(Previous     House of Lords and to be discussed on the following day;Reference:Cabinet 22 together with a Memorandum by the Minister of Labour thef-eon(24), Con-elusion 2    (paper CP. -239 (24)).KG jr.)The Prime Minister read to his colleagues thefollowing notes which he had prepared as the basis of apossible speech on the Bill:-Bl.   This extraordinary crop of disputes doesraise questions other than those by individual disputes of even great magnitude.2.   The sympathetic strike policy has never been supported by Labour Part;/;    I myself havingwritten and spoken against it for many years.3.   If pursued It will Knock the foundationsfrom present code of Trade Union law.4.   A reaction must follow when Trade union will lose the gains of many fights.5.    Once Government gets some pressingly urgentconcerns off its&quot;hand, o,g. , Housing,Unemployment, it proposes&apos;&apos;to uiiciertake a thorough investigation, &apos; BuTTTTTs perfectlycertain that this Bill will not   do. under british conditions it would be a dead letteror defied, and than it could not be put intooperation.    It is another lMond order&quot;.(Intd. ) J.R.M.&quot;The suggestion was made that any condemnation of thesympathetic strike -policy should bo referred to, if at all,only in the most cautious and ncm-coniuittal terms.The.Cabinet agreed  (a) That in the Debate in the Houses of lords the principles of the Bill should not be supported by the Government speakers.    Theyshould explain that if they thought the bill was likely to bring about peace the Labour-Party would be only too glad to adopt it,, butthis -was not the Government&apos; s view;   nor was^ such a conclusion supported by the experienceof similar legislation in the Dominions.They should base their attitude on the Memo-randum of the Minister of Labour (paper cp.-239 (24)) and the Prims Minister&apos;sMemorandum quoted above:
(b) That the Government should undertake a thorough investigation of the questionof the&quot;means for&apos;settlement of indus-trial disputes, when some of the moreimmediately pressing questions bad been dealt with.

This contained the follov^iig draft&apos; amendment to Clause1 of the 3111:-&quot;Clause 1, Page 1, Line 18: Leaveout from &quot;that&quot; to the end of theClause, and insert &quot;the tenanthas had a reasonable opportunityof applying to the local Poor Law-Authority for relief and theAuthority has had a reasonableopportunity of considering anysuch application1The Proposed The first subject of discussion was the above amend-Arrendment.merit.    It was pointed out that the ar^rrlrent would be subjected to considerable criticism in the House ofCommons.    Tire Government would be pressed to state their case in favour- of the Clause as amended.    It was true thatthey would be able to show that a considerable number ofevictions were being applied for and granted, more parti-cularly in Scotland^    They would not, however, be able toshow that tire evictions were due to iuaoilit,/ to pay rentby unemployed poisons.    On the contrary, the whole of theevidence terxieu to show thai this was not the &quot;case.    In thisconnsctloii attention was drawn to the following statement in the uepartmenta 1 Memora*iium in Appendix II:-
&quot;It is the general practice of Boards of guardians, when assessing relief, to takethe rent payable by the applicant intoconsideration, either expressly or in fixing&apos; an inclusive scale.    The more usual practice is for a definite sum to be ear-marked as payable in respect of rent. &quot;The above applied to England, and the Departmental Con-ference had promised further information in regard to scotland.    The following supplementary note was read inregard to Scotland:-8It is understood-that in Scotland evictionson the ground of non-payiient of rent arevery rare in the case of persons in receiptof Poor ReliefoSpeaking generally, the scales of relief are considered to oe sufficient to enable the recipients to meet current rent.It follows from the above that an obligation on Parish Councils to give such measure of relief as will enable rents to be paid wouldnot impose any appreciable extra burden onParish Councils, provided, of course, thatthe Councils remain the judges of whatamount of relief is necessary to attainthis object. &quot;It was pointed out that the Opposition were known tohave figures for Sheffield, and. possibly other places, whichwould confirm the above evidence, that the evictions were due not to non-payment of rent but to other causes, includingmore particularly the Chamberlain Act, which was providedfor in the later Clauses of the Kent and Mortgage Interest(Restrictions) Bill.    It would be pointed out in debate that clause 1 was unnecessary, and an attempt would be made todiscredit the Go vehement on this ground.    It would furtherbe pointed out in debate that the Government had considerablyshifted their ground.    By the original Clause 1 they had castthe burden on to fhe landlords;    then they hed said it shouldbe paid from pub lie funds.   When pressed as to what they meantby this they had suggested the Poor Law Authorities, but when. asked if the whole burden was to fall on to the LocalAuthorities they had said they would consider the matter later.
The result was that the House of Commons was in consider-able confusion on the subject, and it was possible that clause 1 as at present drafted might result in still greater confusion.    The case of the Opposition wouldthen be that they had wanted to help in removing the hardship on the unemployed, but the Government had notbeen able to help them.After some discussion, Sir Aubrey Symonds (second secretary to the Ministry of Health.) was introduced.In reply to a number of questions, Sir Aubrey Symondssaid that the Minister of Health, who had inherited thepowers of the Local Government Board in regard to Poor Lawadministration, was definitely prohibited by Statute fromordering relief in particular cases.    Nevertheless, theMinistry of Health was empowered by Order to direct boards of Guardians to take certain considerations into account in dealing with Poor Law Relief.   At present, if a -personwas destitute in regard to lodging, it was the duty of theGuardians to provide him with % lodging just as much as withfood or clothing when granting out-relief.    The Boards of guardians, however, had to consider whether it was a case for out-relief or whether it should be dealt with by indoor-relief.    They also had to consider whether the amount of the rent payable was appropriate to the circumstances of theclaimant.   The Ministry of Health could, and did when neces-sary, issue orders dealing with the duties of Boards of guardians, enjoining them when giving out-relief to take into consideration the rent the claimant was paying.   Underthe Order now in force certain particulars haa to be obtained in regard to applicants for relief, and these includedparticulars as to the home of the aoplicant, among whichirent was taken into account.    There was also an Order
prohibiting the payment of rent direct to the landlord.Some Boards of Guardians gave a certain amount of reliefwith an additional allowance for rent.    Others give somuch for relief and some proportion, such as one-half,for rent, while others granted an inclusive amount.   a recent Deputation to the Ministry from Sheffield had stated that in that city 10/- of the inclusive amountwas granted in respect of rent.Sir Aubrey Symonds said that, so far as he knew, therewere practically no cases where a recipient for reliefhad been evicted on grounds of non-payment of rent due to unemployment.    There had, of course, been evictions forother causes.    In consequenee of a recent Question inParliament the Ministry had investigated the oases of eighteen persons in a particular workhouse who were alleged to be there owing to non-payment of rent from unemployment,inandfat had been found that/not a single case was this thecause.Sir Aubrey Symonds. stated that the Ministry had know-ledge indirectly that a good many people came before theCourts in connection with eviction claims v/ho had neverapplied for Poor Law Relief and did not wish to apply for it.   From his own Knowledge, however, he could say that agood many County Court Judges, probably, indeed, a majority,before inking an Eviction Order.would give the occupier anopportunity to apply for Poor Law Relief,Questioned as to what advantages Clause 1 of the Bill(as amended) would give, Sir Aubrey Symonds said that, apartfrom consequential action t* ensure thot the Poor &quot;Law Authorities did take rent into consideration, it would give a clear direction to County Court Judges in England, andSheriffs in Scotland, that before granting an Eviction Orderthey must give the tenant an opportunity to apply to the-4&quot; &apos; &quot;.-j.Sr

If they, refused., the applicationwould not have, been considered,, and consequently the Government could not make an order for .possession...    The Guardians could not be accused of any dereliction of duty in refusing to consider^the application, because ex hyp.oth.esi the applicant&quot;could not be deprived of his lodging.     hence the result would be to throw the landlord back into the position in which he would&apos; have beenunder the original unamended Bill, and theopposition lawyers would most probably seize upon this point.&quot;(Signed)    M..

IPoor Law Authorities.    In addition, It would give thesame direction to the Bench at Petty Sessions, which dealt with houses with smaller1 rents.    The Bill wouldbe in effect a direct prohibition to these to give anOrder until an opportunity had been given to the tenantto apply for Poor relief.    It would be on order to them,and a hint to the Judges and Sheriffs.    Consequentiallyto the passing of this Bill it would be necessary to make that they should it clear to the Guardians  .&quot;   take lodging into considera-tion when fixing the amount of Poor Relief.    He believedthat this could be done by administrative order.Considerable discussion then took place in regardto the terms of the proposed amendment.It was pointed out that the present wording onlyprovided that a Court should not grant an Eviction Orderunless the local Poor Law Authority had a reasonableopportunity for considering the application of the tenantfor relief.    An adverse County Court Judge might interpreta &quot;reasonable opportunity&quot; very freely.    For example,, he might say that if the question had been on the Ageixla ofthe Board of Guardians that constituted a &quot;reasonableopportunity&quot; , and even if the Board of Guardians had neverconsidered the case the Eviction Order might be given.In order to meet this difficulty it was proposed to alter the amendment to read as follows&quot;the tenant has had a reasonable opportunityof applying to the local Poor Law Authorityfor relief and the Authority has consideredsuch application&quot;. &quot;     &quot;Sir Aubrey Symonds, who was called in again for consultation on this, point, suggested that the new wordingwas open to&apos; another objection.

It was generally felt that a good deal might &quot;bemade of this point in the House of Commond.After considerable discussion it was agreed tosubmit the amendment to the Cabinet in the following form:Clause 1^ Page 1.? Line 18-; Leave out from &quot;^That^&quot;&quot;^ the eriS 67 the Clause,and insert:-&quot;the tenant lias had a reasonableopportunity of applying to thelocal Poor Law Authority for relief and the&apos;Authority has hadan opportunity, of considering anysuch application&quot;.(1 ;&apos;OTS:    The word &quot;reasonable&quot; hasbeen omitted from beforethe word &quot;opportunity&quot; inthe last line.)Financial After consideration of  he Department al Memo randomAssistanceto Local     (AppendIx 11), it was agreed that the Government shouldAuthorities.resist all idea of a State grant to Local Authorities.In the course of the DebateIt should be pointed out/that the Government measu.r.30 ziiregard to Unemployment Insurance, including, as they do,a 20/o increase of benefits arid the abolition of all &quot;gapsH ,would result in the grant of additional benefits to theunemployed estiva tea at  10,000,000 per annum.    these changes could not fail to reduce the expenditure of boards of Guardians and Parish Councils by an amount far exceedingany additional burden resulting from the obi lotion whichthe Government propose to place upon Local Authorities of including in the relief   nioh tu:..  &apos;    --t to the unemployeda specific item in respect of&apos; rent.    It should further be pointed out chat the question of the relation of loo el to imperial taxation was an entirely separate question wkic..:.must be dealt with as a whole and independently.
Comminication After eons ids ration of the Lord Privy Seal&apos;sto the Leadersof the Opposi-   Memorandum (Append ix III) ,. it was agreed that the.Lord Privy Seal should forward a copy of the revisedamendment to Clause 1 of the Rent and Mortgage Interest(Restrictions) Bill both to Mr Asquith and to Mr Baldwin,with a short covering letter, without any Memorandum,and that Mr Clynes should endeavour to see Mr Asquithbefore the meeting of the Liberal Party at Noon on thefollowing day, in order to seek his support to theGovernment in moving the Closure on Monday, April 7th.
The Conclusions may he summarised as follows:-(a) That the following amendment to Clause 1of the Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restric-tions) Bill should be&quot; submitted to theCabinetClause I, Page 1, Line^ 18: Leave out from &quot;That&quot; to the end of the Clause,and insert:- Hhe tenant has had areasonable opportunity of applying tothe Poor naw Authority for relief andthe Authority has had an opportunityof considering any such application&quot;.Cb) That, b ex ore the Committee Stage of theBillj the Minister of Health and theSecretary for Scotland should ascertaindefinitely vsfoether in England and wales and Scotland respectively it was practicableby administrative action to secure thatthe Poor Law Authorities shall, whengranting relief, give such relief as maybe necessary to protect the tenant fromeviction on the ground of non-payment of rent.(o) That the Lord Privy Seal should forward to Mr Baldwin and Mr As quit h a copy of theproposed. amendment to Clause 1 of the rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) bill as given&apos;above izi (a).(d) That the Lord Privy Seal should see MrAsquith ard ash his assistance to theGovernment in moving the Closure onMonday, April 7th.(e) That the Government should resist all ideaoffa State grant to Local Authorities forthe purpose of Clause 1 of the Rent andMortgage Interest (Restrictions) bill and should take the line that the relation of local to Imperial taxation is a separatequestion which must be dealt with as a whole.(The Meeting adjourned at 10 p.m.)

Outline of Parliamentary Position.

(Circulated by the Lord Privy Seal.)



I circulate for the information of my Colleagues the following outline of the successive changes in the Parliamentary position in regard to this Bill.

The discussion on the second reading was opened last Wednesday, and after the speeches of Mr. Neville Chamberlain and Mr. Asquith, it seemed clear to these who heard them that the Bill would be defeated unless an assurance was given by us to the House that steps would be taken to throw upon the community the burden of paying the rent of unemployed workmen threatened with eviction. I accordingly had a discussion in my room with the following of my colleagues, who alone were then immediately available in the House of Commons; the Minister of Health, the Secretary for Scotland, the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Chief Whip. There was also present at this meeting the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Prime Minister.

We reached the unanimous conclusion that I should give an assurance to the House that we were willing to substitute in Committee and amended clause in substitution for the existing Clause 1, which would throw the burden upon the community, or if this were not possible we would take other steps to secure this end. All my colleagues agreed that by whatever means it could be done we should secure shelter for families threatened with eviction rather than let the Bill be defeated.

On Thursday I stated in the House that a further announcement would be made on Friday. Before the Prime Minister left the House on Thursday I showed him the notes

on

  


on wliioh ray statement would be &quot;based.,     I Immediatelygot into touch with the Parliamentary Draftsman in ohargoof the Bill, and in the absence of Mr.Wheatley, with his principal Assistant at the Ministry, who at my request 03Friday morning had an interview with the Solicitor general for Scotland and the Under Secretary for Scotland In regardto the doubtful points which had been raised on the previous evening in regard to the position in Scotland,I then coiffinunicated tb Mr.Speaker the terms of thestatement that I intended to make at the conclusion ofbusiness for that day*   This statement I made aii 4 O1clockin the Terms recorded in Hansard this morning,,     immediately on the conclusion of my statement Mr.HevilIe Chamberlainput the following question.-&quot;Is it the intention that the final&quot;verdict shall rest upon the parish&quot;council in Scotland, and the&quot;board of guardians in England, as&quot;the ease may be., or has he in mind&quot;some recourse to national fluids in&quot;aid of the local authorities.&quot;to which, in accordance with the advice which I had receivedfrom the technical and legal offioers whom I had consulted,I replied:-&quot;The intention is that, in&quot;the case of Scotland as of&quot;this country, the burden&quot;should;rest upon the looal.&quot;authorities.&quot;Mr.ICirkwood then made a speech in which he said that thePrime Minister had given &quot;a guarantee that it would bo anational charge&quot;, and in which after abusing all of us hedemanded not local but Exchequer support, saying, &quot;theHouse will back up brave and cotirageous men - but jellyfish!&quot;In referring to his speech in my reply I saicl:-&quot;I have stated that 5 in the first&quot;instance, this charge will be.&quot;borne by the local authorities*&quot;I have not said one word to&apos;indicate&quot;the view that the Govorumr-nt is&quot;opposed to recouping the local authorities&quot;from. State funds.   That is a question&quot;which, of course j, the Government will&quot;be prepared to examine.&quot;Here/
y: U 3Here I had in mind the fact that if our Bill became law thelocal authorities would certainly press for some state assistance, and that we must be.prepared in due course toexamine that question.    I felt convineed that we could notenlist the aid of our own party for this Bill if we rejectedabsolutely the possible prospect of ultimate raid being givento local authorities.    I xirged, however, that to meet the-urgent necessities of threatened and distressed workmensomebody must provide the money, and the Bill took theSwiftest course to supply a remedy.Mr-,, Chamberlain then put the following further questions;&quot;When the right hon. Gentleman&quot;speaks about recouping the local&quot;authorities, does he mean that he&quot;is going to advance money to them&apos;from national funds or does he mean&quot;that the charge shall rest in the&quot;last instance upon national funds&quot;anti would therefore require a Money&quot;Resolution?&quot;.To which I replied;&quot;It is really too early to discuss&quot;the method or the procedure.&quot;This is not the time to-determine&quot;whether money will be advanced or&quot;refunded after actual payment&quot;.1 My colleagues- will realise from the above that theeffect of ray statement did not go beyond an assurance thatthe question of State Aid to local authorities would beconsidered at a later date should the neoessity thereforarise.J.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITA1THIC IIAJ3SSTTVS GOvTJBHtGSbTT-CAB I N S T.1.TT AKD MORTGAGE INTEREST RESTRICTIONS BILL.ION OP FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES *(Circulated by The Lord Privy Seal.)In order that my colleagues might have before them the views of the Departments concerned on the question ofthe possible grant of assistance to Local Authorities from public funds, I summonarl a meeting this morning at whichthere were present: - Six&apos; George Lo Barstow (Treasury)MrsJohn Lamb.Ct.Bc  (Under Secretary for Scotland) and:Sir Aubrey Symonds, KoCB. (Second Secretary^ Ministry ofHealth,)The Memorandum which I circulate herewith was drawnup by these officers and in my view represents fairly thetwo courses either of which the Government might adopt.I should like to make it clear that for the reasonsstated in the Memorandum the official view was strongly against any grant being made to Local Authorities at thepresent time.    The alternative- suggestion put forward atthe conclusion of the Memorandum was however included at my express wish as being the least objectionable form inwhich a concession might be made if the Cabinet deemed it essential that some gesture towards the Local Authoritiesshould be made.I * R. CLY1TES.
HSHT AND MORTGAGE IIITEREST RESTRICTIONS BILLDepartmental Memorandum prepared &quot;by Representatives of theTreasury., Ministry of Health, and Scottish Office.According to the information of the Ministry ofHealthy practically no evictions are taking place in Englandand &quot;Wales on the ground of non-payment of rent in thecase of persons in receipt of poor law relief.It is the general practice of Boards of Guardianswhen assessing relief to take the rent payable by theapplicant inSio consideration, either expressly or in fixing an inclusive scale.     The more usual practice isfor a definite sum to be ear-marked as payable in respectof rent.As regards Scotland there is no reason to suppose that a materially different practice prevails, but enquiry is being made on this point-, and a further note on thissubject will be circulated.The immediate financial effect, therefore, of theadoption of the suggestion put to the Government on Fridayin the House of Commons that Local Authorities should berecouped in respect of the additional expenditure incurred by them in respect of rent would be small.On the other hand, it Is only fair to urge that, theproposals of the Government in regard to unemploymentinsurance embodied In the two Bills that are about to bebrought before the House of Commons, including as they do a 20% increase of benefits and the abolition of all gaps,will result in the grant of additional benefits to theuiicmployed estimated at  310,000,000 per annum.     these changes
changes cannot fail to reduce the expenditure of boards of Guardians and Parish Councils by an amount far exoeedingany additional &quot;burden resulting from the obligation which theGovernment propose to place upon Local Authorities of including in the relief which they grant to the unemployed a specificitem in respect of rent.On general grounds it would, in the opinion of all theDepartments represented, be most undesirable to embark ona system of Government subsidy in aid of rent3 which wouldbe likely to have most serious financial and economic consequences.   Moreover there would in view of the varyingpractice in different parts of the country be almostinsuperable technical difficulty in assessing the extra costincurred by Local Authorities in respect of the partioularitem of rent.The conclusion drawn from the above considerations wasthat the Government would be on perfectly secure ground ifthey were to take up the position that no case had at presentbeen made cut for the grant of further State Assistance toLocal Authorities, having regard to the great relief whichwill be&apos; given to Local Authorities by the unemploymentinsurance proposals.If, however, it is thought unavoidable to make someannouncement of financial concession by the Government itwas felt that it should be made clear that experience must first be gained of the actual effect of the new proposals,and that the Government is entitled in this connection totake into account the effect cf their unemployment proposals.Any conditional promise of assistance on these lines shouldalso
also &quot;be limited to the case of the &quot;necessitous areas&quot;, for it is only in those areas that it can he reasonablyrepresented that their financial resources might prevent them from making an adequate rent allowance; but whateverconcession may eventually be granted, it was generally agreed that the problem should not be definitely linked up with the question of rent, which is only one of the factors to be taken into account in connection with Poor Law Reliefbut that it should be treated on a general basis.

Owing to the shortness of the time avail-able I could not undertake to lay a White Paper but I indicated that I should be willing to sake known before the Second reading the terms of the amendments which the Government intended, tomove in Committee.     More than that clearly was impossible, as theactual terms of the amendment could not be definitely settleduntil after Monday&apos;s Cabinet.After the House had actually risen I was again pressed onthis question and I undertook that by Question time a shortMemorandum explaining the nature of the Government&apos;s proposed amendments. together with the terms of the amendments,  should be handed to Mr.Baldwin and IJr.Asquith.      I think that there would be considerable objection in including in this Memorandum anyquestion of the grant of assistance from public funds to LocalAuthorities even if the Government decided later to adopt such acourse,&apos; as, were we to do so I think that we might again find ourselves faced with a ruling by the Speaker that n Money. Resolution would be required in the case pf the present Bill to. carry our wishes into effect,per these reasons I suggest that the Memorandum to becommunicated to the Leaders of the Opposition should not go beyond the terms of the statement attached hereto,J.S.clyse3s.5th April,&quot; 1924,
RENT AED MORTGAGE INTEREST RESTRICTIONS BILL.If the Bill is given a second reading the government propose on the Committee Stage to put dowri an amendment to the following effect;-Clause 1, page 1, line 18, leave out from &quot;that&quot;to the end of the Clause, and insert &quot;the tenant&quot;has had a reasonable opportunity of applying to&quot;the local Poor Law Authority for. relief, and the&quot;authority has had a reasonable opportunity of&quot;considering any such application.&quot;It will be noted that the amendment contains two proposals:    first to omit certain words from the Bill, and secondly to insert other words in substitution.The words proposed to be left out embody the principle on which the main objection to the Clause was founded,namely that the burden of unpaid rent was to fall on the landlord.The new provision to be inserted does not in termsplace the burden on the local authority but indicates thatthe tenant may look to them for help and provides that he must have an opportunity of so doing.It is not proposed to insert any amendments in thepresent Bill dealing with the duty of the local Poor LawAuthorities in this matter.The Government, however, will take steps, either hfadministrative action, or, if any legislation is foandto be necessary, by a separate Bill, to secure that the poor Law Authorities shall, when granting relief, give such relief as may be necessary to protect the tenantfrom eviction on the ground of non-payment of rent.
