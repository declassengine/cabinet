as to any other commercial venture, the promoters have &quot;been unable to satisfy the Trade Paoilities Committee as to *their share of the oost of the under-taking and it must now be understoodthat the scheme has no government support.(18) That? having regard to the political and&apos;other considerations involved,, the Ministerof Transport should submit to the cabinet a statement of the position regardingtrunk road reconstruction from thetransport point of view, the statement to deal fully with the question of therestoration of the roads in question and the effect of such restoration onunemp I oyment.(19) That no alteration should be ias.de inthe present arrangements under whichthe Uhenrpioyment Grants Committee andthe Ministry of Transport assist ruralro ad u nd e rt akin gs.(20) That no alteration should be made inthe present arrangements under whichthe Unemployment Grants Committeeassist approved land reclamation etc.schemes.(2l)&apos;That the Secretary of State for war should be authorised at once to place orders for engineering, textile andother stores provided^for in the army estimates 1924/25, to a total valueof  1,350,000 c,(22) That the Secretary of State for air should be authorised to accelerate,so far as practicable, the placing oforders for stores, works, etc, forwhich provision is made in the AirEstimates 1924/25, and which are indicated in Part I of the AirMinistry&apos;s Mote annexed to CU.-647.(23) That the First Commissioner of works should be authorised to expend a sumnot exceeding  44,000 in carrying outthe work specified in his letterof4th February, 1924, annexed to C.U,-647,and that the necessary &quot;provision forthis expenditure should be made in theOffice of Works Estimates for 1924/25.(24)That the provision of the Ministry ofAgriculture and Fisheries for assistingland drainage, etc. works-during thecurrent season should be increased from 250,000 to  310,000...25) That the provision of the Board of.&apos; Agriculture for Scotland for land drainage, etc. A^orks in Scotland duringthe current season should be increased&quot;from  35,000 to  50,000.-8-

The adoption of such a policyis open to the gravest political, economicand financial objections and it is in thehighest degree improbable that, even if adopted, unemployment would be permanentlyrelieved or the public interest safeguarded.(30) That the question of removing the existingbar to assistance being ;qiven to theRailway Groups, the only&apos; substantia.public utility undertakings which areat present ineligible for government assistance, should be considered afterthe results of the Conferences between ministers and the Railways are known.(3l) To take note that the Unemployment com-mittee hope to be shortly in a/j?ositionto report to the Cabinet on the followingoutstanding questions:-(a) Juvenile Unemployment.(b) The position in certain basic industries.(c) Unemployment among women.(d); The Hallway Groups and Unemployment.

A P P E 3 D I X.-STAO?SMSlfr OF POLICY IN R72GAP.D TO SINGAPORE.we have given oareful consideration to the proposal todevelop thee^eate-a-tsev Naval Base at Singapore.    We have closelystudied the reasons which led to the adoption of this project, and the arguments in support of its continuationnaval defence.urged upon us from the point of view of fceehnieai-efcsea^eg?.We have, had, however, to consider the matter in a widerrelationship, and have come to the conclusion that we cannotash Parliament to proceed with this scheme.   We are con-vinced that if we were to do so our action would exercise a most detrimental effect on our general foreign policy.As we have repeatedly stated, we stand for a policy ofinternational co-operation through a strengthened andenlarged League of Nations, the settlement of disputes byconciliation and. judicial arbitration, and the creationof conditions which will make a comprehensive agreement on limitation of armaments possible.    As stated in thePrime Minister&apos;s letter to M. Poiaeare&apos; of February 21st, -&quot;Our task meanwhile must be to establish confidence, andthis task can only be achieved by allaying the internationalsuspicions and anxieties which exist today.&quot;We are convinced, apart from any other considerations,continue the development ..of the .....tnat to eitiK7aris-eB-&apos;%tie-es&apos;ea%ieB-ei-&apos;-a-&apos;g?ea% isiaval Base- at singapore would hamper the- establishment of this, confidence and lay our good faith open to suspicion.    Whilst maintain-ing present standards in a state of complete efficiency,be responsible for&apos; , we take the view that it would be a serious mistake to hegianew developments that could only be justified on assumptions-1-
that would definitely admit that we had doubts in thesuccess of our own policy,    as a result we should almost inevitably drift into a condition of mistrust and competition  of armaments in the Par East.The tr-ie-geHei-ally-aCTBa^^ed-thaw-fehe Singapore Base isan essentialurged ealy as /part of a complete defensive Pacificstrategy.    Should the practical necessity for puttingsuch a strategy into operation arise by reason of thecondition of world politics and a return to atteiapts toprovide Imperial security primarily by armaments? thewhole question would have to be re-considered, but inthe opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government that has not now-arisen, and it is the duty of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto try and prevent its arising.We have every confidence in our policy, and we desireto give it the best possible chance of success.    As an earnest of our pood faith, therefore, we have decided not to proceed with the Naval Base at Singapore.(intd. )  J.R.M.        -2, whitehall Gardens, S. W.1,March 6, 1924.
