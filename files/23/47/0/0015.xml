B.STATEMENT OF POLICE Iff RBGAPJ) TO SOGAPOHEl.We have given careful consideration to the proposal todevelop the naval Base at Singapore.   We have closely studied thereasons -which led to tho adoption.e  this project, and thearguments in support of its continuation urged upon us from theppint of view of naval defence.We had, however, to consider tho matter in a widerrelationships and came to the conclusion that we could not ask parliament to preoeed with this scheme.   We were convincedthat if we v?ore to do so our action would exercise a mostdetrimental effect on our general foreign policy.   As we have repeatedly stated, we stand for a policy of international co--operation through a strengthened and enlarged league ofNation the settlement of disputes by conciliation and judicialarbitration, and the creation of conditions which will make a comprehensive agreement on limitation of armaments possible. as stated in the Prime Minister^ letter to Mr. Poincare ofFebruary 21st, - &quot;our task meanwhile must be to establishconfidence, and this task can only be achieved by allaying theinternational suspicions and anxieties which exist today.&quot;It seemed clear, apart from any other considerations,that to continue the development of the laval Base at Singaporewould hamper the establishment of this confidence and lay our good faith open to suspicion,   Whilst maintaining present standard in a state       complete efficiency, we take the view thatit would be a serious mistake to be responsible for new developments that could only be justified on assumptions thatwould, definitely admit that we had doubts In the success of ourown policy.   As a result we should almost inevitably drift intoa condition of mistrust and competition of armaments in theFar Sast.Having provisionally reached the conclusions which have set out, we felt it our duty in view of the discussions atthe
the recent Imperial Conference to communicate with the Governments ofthe self-governing DominionSc    We therefore put the position before them and invited their views.    I propose to give theHouse a summary of these views.    The Canadian Government tell us that they wish to refrain from any advice on the problem.The Irish Pree State has adopted a similar attitude.   Asto Australia, Hew Zealand and Newfoundland I must explain quite clearly that their Prime Ministers wish, and indeed urge, us toproceed with the Base.    The Cemmonwealth Government express cordialsympathy with our international policy of conciliation.    Theytell us that the desire In Australia is for a better understandingamong the nations and a definite reduction of armaments on every possible occasion.   They consider however that the action whichwe propose, instead of assisting the po3.money in view, willjeopardise it in that any reduction in the mobility of theFleet will reduce our influence In the Councils of the Nations.If the development of the Singapore base (the intention toproee-ed with which was, they point out, well understood at the timeof the Washington Conference) is now to be discontinued, australia would rather see this step taken as a means for securing further international agreement for mutual reduction of armaments.The New Zealand Government attach great importance to development of the Base, their opinion being founded mainly on grounds of naval strategy.,   Whilst laying stress on the view that its xise isfor defensive and not offensive purposes, they feel that theinterests of the British Empire in the Pacific will be endangeredshould our capital ships be unable to operate in those waters, andthat the time has not yet come to rely solely on the influence for peace cf the League of Nations.I should add that the Commonwealth Government have informed us of their readiness to submit proposals to theirParliament for a substantial contribution to the developmentof the base.   New Zealand has already generously offered a firstcontribution of  100,000 towards it.lastly from South Africa we have heard from general smuts
Smuts that eur proposed policy whieh he describes as &quot;a boldmove towards enduring peace&quot; meets with his v;hoIehearte&amp;agreement.   He feels that the authority of the British Empireas the protagonist of the great cause of appeasement and conciliation among the nations would be seriously underminedby the construction of the Singapore base.From the above summary, I think I may claim that we havea large measure.      sympathy in the Dominions with our international policy, even if all parts of the Empire do not feel able to endorse the methods by which we consider thatthat policy should be carried out.   The criticisms are founded,in the main, on the conception that the Singapore base isessential as part of a complete defensive Pacific strategy.Should the practical necessity for putting such a strategyinto operation arise by reason of the condition of worldpolitics and a return to attempts to provide Imperial securityprimarily by armaments, the whole question would have to bere-oonsider&amp;d, but in the opinion of Eis Majesty1s Governmentthat has not now arisen, and it is the duty of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to try and prevent its arising.We have every confidence in our policy, and wo feelthat a decision not to proceed with the Haval Base at singapore will give that policy the best possible chanceof success and is an earnest of our good faith.
