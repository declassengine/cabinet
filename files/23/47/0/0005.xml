Since thewhole of the money both for covenanted anduncovenanted benefit was obtained under a contributory scheme, and the liability topay contributions whilst in insuravdeemployment was the same for all, the test of ,;need&quot; , which admittedly could not beapplied to covenanted benefit, could&apos;notJustifiably be applied to uncovenanted       vbenefit.    As the restrictions had been imposed by administrative action, theGovernment intended to remove them by administrative action.

REPORT OF UNEMPLOYMENT COMMITTEE.



(1) The Committee have received Reports from the Housing Sub-Committee (C.U.632 and C.U.664) and after consideration of those Reports at their meetings on the 5th February, 1924, (C.U. 74th Conclusions) and the 7th February, 1924 (C.U. 75th Conclusions) have decided to present the following Report.



(2) Requirements.

The estimate of the number of houses required is a matter of some difficulty but clearly it must provide for three things - normal expansions of population, the overtaking of the accumulated shortage and the replacement of unsatisfactory houses.

For England and Wales the number of houses required to meet ordinary growth may be put about 75,000. The Committee consider that a modest estimate of the accumulated shortage of small houses would be 300,000. As regards the replacement of bad houses, it may be estimated that there are 6,000,000 small houses in England and Wales and that the normal life of a house could not properly be put at more than 100 years. As, however, a large proportion of these houses, built during the period of rapid industrial

  
development, have at ill a considerable life, it wouldnot be necessary at once to put in hand the full programme for the renewal of 60,000 houses per annum *The&apos; Committee propose to adopt the following figures as representing an annual programme for aperiod, of ten ye are;-HjDuses^,To make good the accumulated shortage,       30,000To provide for the normal expansionof population *o.. ,v.75,000To provide for renewals ,, ea a. o     t 45 ,,000150^000Assuming that 50,000 houses per annum worerequired, for Scotland,, the total annual programme, for10 years, would be 200^000 housesaProbleTiia.The problem may, therefore, be defined, broadlyas being to supply over a. period say, of 15, years some,3X5 ,,000 houses ice* to secure, in each of. the fifteen years anaverage of, .say 153;000 bouses, which, can be let at a rentwhich the workers who erect the houses can afford to pay fromtheir wages..In this connection It may be observed thatthe Chamberlain Scheme fails to meet the latter .     ....condition for under that Scheme the,houses-are toa large - extent being built - for. sale, and where theyare being built &apos;.by-..local- authorities -for letting,the rents charged are ordina.rI.ly too high foi&apos; theordinary worker,.
o    101(4) Dlffi cult lea to be overcome.,The primary diffieult.le3---to--.be overcome incarrying out a scheme of this kind are the shortages in labour and in certain, kinds of materiai:-(a) Labour.At the present time it is perfectly clear that there aro not sufficient skilled.- men in the building industry to ensure the carrying out of a programme of the magnitudeIndicated,     This no doubt results in alarge measure from the instability of conditions in the building industry in thepast.     The President of the Building TradesEmployers Federation stated a few days ago that In1908 there were from 800,000 to 900,000 men employed in the industry, and that this number had been reduced to about half.In fact, with a greater population in1924 than in 1908, the number of men in theindustry was 450,000 less than it was 15years ago.     He was of opinion that the bui3.dingtrade could place at once 100,000 additionalskilled workers to cope with the contract workoffered.     He considered that for 200,000houses an additional 300,000 men would berequired,.     These figures are probably on thehigh sido but assuming that the demand for labour for commercial and other work than housingremains constant, it will certainly be
necessary to&apos; introduce into the industry a largenumber of additional skilled men.(b ) Materials.The position as regards materials is not quite so serious though.in the matter of bricks some considerable expansion of productive capacity wouldbe required to guarantee the erection of 200,000houses a year.     The existing plant In the country would supply all the light castings and cement required and there is not likely to be any difficulty in regardto a supply of timber.(5) Financing the scheme.The Committee are convinced that arrangementsjjiust be made to secure that the houses provided can be letat rents roughly equivalent to those paid by the workingclasses before the tfar.     Thus rents would vary with the locality but for the purpose of a general estimate thefigure of 8/- a week to cover rent and rates may be taken.On the basis of an average cost of a house of  500, theannual loss would be, approximately  16 a year for 80 years or  38,000,000 for th total programme of 2,375,000 houses.If higher rents were attainable on the basis of letting thehouses to those workers for whom they are intended, the total loss might be somewhat reduced.    If the support of the localauthorities to a policy of letting houses at a rent of the kindcontemplated is to be secured, generous arrangements will haveto be made as to the share of the loss to be borne by the State.This would h?ve to be a matter of negotiation with the localauthorities.
It is, of course, important in the interestof economy and proper management that the localauthorities should, have a definite financial interest in the scheme.(6)     Sroad conditions which the scheme must^gatigj^The broad conditions v/hich must be met if a schemeis to be a success are as follows s-(a) The supply over  a long period of such a numberof houses as will overcome shortage^ keep pace with normal demand and replace unsatisfactorydwellings by healthy houses.(b) The supply of these houses at such rents that theordinary worker will be able to live in them-o(c) Security for the workmen, builders and manufacturers of material who are asked to expand the resources ofthe Industry, and for the local authorities who willbe responsible for giving effect to the scheme.(d) Protection against profiteerlng0Every practicable step must be taken to guard againstthe great increase of prices which brought the Addisonscheme to a standstill and in fact, rings of all kindswhether manufacturers, builders or workers must be prevented,.,The full co-operation of labour, builders, manufacturers andlocal authorities must be secure!,5
n   1047)Arranpements to be made with various Interests.(a) Labour *      It will be necessary to approach the&quot;unions to secure agreement in the adoption of the scheme to supply the labour necessary in increasing quantities to ensure thatthere&apos; will be no slacking and to guarantee that the launching of the scheme will not be used as a means of obtaining wagesthey would not have been able, to secure but for the housing scheme.      It will be possible to assure the representatives ofthe Unions that it is the intention to provide for a schemawhich will guarantee.them against unemployment for at leastten years, provided houses are delivered according to areasonable time table *      It will also be possible&apos;to assurethem that a primary object of the scheme is the provisionof houses at rents which the ordinary workman will be  able topay.There are two ways by which the number of men inthe industry can be increased:-(a) By premoting men already in the industry to becraftsmen,;    and, . --.&apos;-*(b) By the addition of apprentices.It should be practicable to secure with goodwill theaddition of an appreciable number of craftsmen, possibly25,000 by the promotion of labourers.     The apprenticeshipquestion is One of very great Importance for the condition ofthe industry at present is that it is not providing for itsordinary growth.      It Is estimated that the number of apprentices in the trade at present does not exceed 21,000,while even under existing rules three or four times that number would be permitted.      This question is already engagingthe attention of a Committee of the Enploy-srs end Operatives, andit should I
toe practicable to secure a satisfactory solution.(b) Builders.     The builders are again clearly interested inthe guarantee of a definite programme covering a number ofyears, and they will require to be assured on this point ifthey are to make the necessary expansion of their arrangements and undertake to accept apprentices in large numbers.  .The importance of preventing inflation of cost through undueprofits or otherwise Will have to be Impressed upon thebuilders.     The fact that the Local Authorities who willbe responsible in the main for carrying out the scheme willhave the direct financial interest in the expenditure will serve as a valuaable check against undue increasing of tenderprices.     It will be necessary, however, for the departments to be able to assist Local Authorities in this matter,    andthe Departments should keep detailed records of costs whichwill enable checks to be applied.   . It may further be necessaryto have in reserve a power of direct building by the State., i(c) Manufacturers of Materials.     The manufacturers ofmaterials also will be asked in view of the large programme to take steps tp increase their production.     So far as..,........practicable they should adopt methods of standardisation andaim at low prices by mass production.    . It may be possible tosecure some definite agreement on the subject of profits, andfor this purpose it may be necessary in the near future toundertake, costing investigations by accountants end other experts.     In any event definite statutory powers must be takenproviding for severe penalties, against profiteering..     It may -*even be necessary in the \last resort to take powers to takeover works closed down by an owner or to put down plant if.supplies prove inadequate *   (     , .. . . ,    .^S^i^A^^S^^^ j&apos;-^;;V?:-vv,:Isip! &apos;^.:-m$p^gi
&apos;        Loosl Authorities,    With the Local Authoritiesit&quot;will bp necessary to obtain assurances of whole-hearted-operation in the scheme, and. especially acceptance ofthe principle that the houses ere to be provided et a rentwhich the workman who builds, the houses can afford to pay.This will probably in, the -main turn on s question of theamount of the Exchequer contribution and, as suggested above, it is proposed that this should be settled on lines which would be generous to the Local Authorities whilegiving them a direct incentive to economy.(8) Immediate steps to be taken.i An outline of ascheme which the Committee consider. will&quot; fulfil allconditions and enable the programme to be carried out with success is set out below.       Preliminary conferences have already taken place with representatives of the building trade employersand   mployed.    Meetings with representatives of building materialsmanufacturers are being arranged and at a later st8ge negotiationswith the Locel Authorities will be undertaken.Outllnei of Legislation necessary for Scheme.i. Provide for. immediate extension of the&quot;C*hamberlalnscheme.from October,1925 to October,1928.   :This will, start the scheme with a straight run of 5ik years under known and generous subsidy conditions. provision would also be made for modifying the amount of assistance and for giving the assistance at different rates for saythree categories of districtsj assistance at highest rate to be given In districts considered most necessitousaccording to some tests.     The modification of the amountof assistance would be made on the principle of so adjusting.
the annual Exchequer subsidy that the local authority would be able to let the houses at a low rent withoutthrowing an undue burden on the rates &quot;while retaining the local authority&apos;a direct financial interest intheir expenditure.     It is proposed that the State shareof the subsidy should not exceed an over-all average figure, of          per house for -      years.       Suchincreased assistance would require to be given forall houses not contracted for or the construction ofwhich was not started at the time the scheme was announced.ii*      Provide that if at the end of 1S27 an averageproduction exceeding 120,000 houses a year taken over for 2 years 1925 and 1927 had been-reached for Englandand Wales and an appropriate figure for Scotland,Government assistance shall be continued for 3 yearsfurther .from October,, 1928, i,-e, to October, 1931,but the Government in 192C shall have the right to revise the rate of assistance in the light of the existingcircumstances *     This will make the continuance ofGovernment assistance dependent on the Industrydelivering the goods and will be an incentive   to localauthorities to administer the scheme.     The builders willhave to deliver the houses at a reasonable price, thematerial makers must provide for the additional material required and the men will have to have arranged for theexpansion of the personnel.   If the scheme Is killedby builders or material manufacturers or others inflatingthe price the Government will withdraw their assistance.
It Is to be observed that the 120,000 to be aimed at atthis stage is a minimum.    In actual practice all the agencies concerned, the local authorities, the buildingindustry and the suppliers of materials would make certain of the continuance of the scheme by exceeding, perhaps bya considerable margin, the minimum requiredoill.    Provide further that if at the end of 1930 a production of not less than 150,000 houses a year, for england and Wales, and a proper figure for Scotland, hasbeen reached over the t-&quot;0 years 1929 end 1930 assistance will fce available for a further 3 years to October, 1934,but the Government shall&apos;again have a right to review therate of assistance for the ensuing 3 years.iv*      Provision to be made for a further term of 5 yearsprovided that houses are built in numbers sufficient tosecure that the average production of 158,000 a year for thefifteen years is obtained in Great Britain as a whole,    the precise figures to be Inserted in the Bill as regards Scotlandneed to be further considered and. some adjustment as regardsEngland and wales may be required when fuller information is available as to the output of the industry and the rate of probable expansion,v.       Provide definite powers for dealing with profiteeringin the event of the plan of making Government assistancedependent upon out-put failing to secure the provision ofmaterials at.reasonable prices.(Signed on behslf of the Committee).SIDNEY WEBBChairman.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.8th February, 1924.
STATEMENT ISSUED BY THE MINISTRY op HEALTH INRlijGlu^&apos;&quot;TTr&quot;TH]^^ -&quot;poplar ooterttssst:-1 1-1 The aotion of the Minister of Health in deciding torescind the special Poplar Order of 1922 and to remit anysurcharge made under it appears to have given rise to con-siderahle misunderstanding.    The Order in question was issued under Section 52 of the Poor Law Amendment Act, 1834,and its effect was to limit the amount of outdoor relief tothe- scale laid down in Regulations issued under the LocalAuthorities (Financial Provisions) Act, 1921, for governingclaims upon the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund.    The&quot; position which the Minister discovered was this:-&quot;The Local Authorities (Financial Provisions) Act,1921, had been superseded by the Local Authorities(Emergency Provisions) Act, 1923, and the scaleprescribed by the Regulations under the formerAct had been replaced by a statutory flat rateprescribed by the Act of 1923;    this had not beeninterfered with.    Hence the Order of 1922,though not rescinded, had, in fact, become obsolescent-lete, and experience had shown that it was inpractice unworkable.The results of the rescission are not all thatappears to be commonly supposed.    The action taken does not involve or imply any alteration in general Poor Law polioy.    Tire Poplar Boardof Guardians will remain in exactly the same position as every other Board of Guardians inthe country, and will be subject to precisely the same limitations and restrictions.    any expenditure on relief which is excessive orotherwise unlawful, whether incurred by thePoplar or any other Board of Guardians; willcontinue to be liable to disallowance, and surcharge.Moreover, the claims of the Poplar Board of guardians upon the Metropolitan Common PoorFund will be restricted as before to the pre-scribed flat rate, and any expenditure in excessof that flat rate will fall upon Poplar alone&quot;.

Copy No.c A 3 I I E 5.Agri cultural P o 1 i cy,Note^ by  the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.I circulate herewith for the information ofray colleagues the proposals of the Agricultural PolicyCommittee suggested for announcement in Parliament bythe Prime Minister,Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries,7th February 1934.
AGRICILTyKE.Proposals - suggested for;, announcement in,..Payllament.1,     A definite statement that neither protective duties on food nor subsidies on the lines hitherto suggested can beadopted.   Agriculture must be conducted on an economic basiswithout artificial; supports from the public purse *29     Wap;esu   Machinery must be set up to provide for thepayment of reasonable rates of wages to agricultural labourers.Wages must be a first charge on the industry and the government cannot acquiesce in the continuation of a system under whichthe current rate of wages is fixed on the basis of what theleast efficient members of the industry can afford to pay.3*     Co^pperat ion *   The Government desires to extend and develop co-operative organisations for the purchase and. sale ofagricultural requirements and produce on the lines recommendedby the Llnlithgow Committee.    In particular1, Parliament willhe asked to provide funds for the purpose of making&apos; loans toassist in the establishment of bacon factories, creameries, eggcollecting depots, fruit grading stations, cheese factories,slaughter-houses, auction marts, etc.    It is proposed toappoint an Advisory Committee to the Ministry to consider andreport on applications for loans.4*,     Credit *   The Government, is examining the question whether further facilities should be provided for granting credit to farmers for working capital either under the Agricultural CreditsAct or otherwisea5.     County; Apylcultural Conimltt^eg,* . The Government proposesto make more use of these Committees, possibly on a reconstituted,basis, for the promotion and development of agriculture in their districts *   The Committees will be invited to use their influence to raise the standard of farming, to call public attention both to cases of now and successful enterprises by progressive
o 110farmers and to any cases in ^fiich land is being mismanaged ormisused; to advise as to the conduct of a campaign of publicity and propaganda to advertise British agricultural produce.; to interest the general public in agricultural problems; to promote the fuller use of the educational and advisory service, and toassist in organising co-operative enterprises and better marketingfacilities as well as developing schemes for the improvement oftransport facilities, the provision of electrical power and lightjand the revival of village life.6&quot;     Allojbmgirbeo   The Government is anxious to assist and develop the allotment movement both in the urban areas and inthose country villages in nftiich insufficient provision is madeat present for the needs of the population.   The responsibleLocal Authorities will be urged and stimulated to make the fullest possible use of their powers in that direction.7.     Smalli Holdings.   The schemes for the settlement of ex- -Service men on the land will be pressed forward and completed.With regard to rents, the Government recognises that in manycases rents were fixed three or four years ago&apos; when agriculturalconditions were more favourable than they are at present and thatconsequently the original level of rents cannot be maintained.A thorough and systematic revision of rents is being carried outby consultation between the Ministry of Agriculture, the CountyCouncils and the small-holders themselves, and In more than halfof the counties in England and Wales this revision has beencompleted and a settlement satisfactory to cl 1 parties has been arrived at.   The Government will make it their business to seethat the revision of rents in the remaining counties shall becontinued and completed with the minimum of delay.The Government will also consider whether the scheme under which small-holdings for non-service men, which was inoperation before the War, should not be revived In order toprovide for the needs of many men all over the country who havethe necessary knowledge and experience to become successful
small-holders, hut who have been debarred for the last ten years from any opportunity of obtaining land.Research and Education.     The   Government will lose no opportunity of developing and extending the provision for educa-tion and scientific research In the belief that the success ofagriculture depends more than anything else on the personalqualities of those who occupy and cultivate the land of thecountrya     The Government believes that while reasonable provision has already been made for tho investigation of most of the purelyscientific problems affecting agriculture, there is great need for more effort to bring home to the ordinary working farmers the lessons that science can teach, and to do more In the directionof practical research and experiments in connection with theeconomic problems of the Industry,     Further, it is suggestedthati in accordance with the recommendation of the LinlithgowCommittee, it would be advisable to attach marketing officers to.the Agricultural Colleges, who could assist and advise farmersas to marketing problems.       Funds could also be usefully spent in making grants to assist in the formation and maintenance of farmers Account Keeping Societies, tvhereby bodies of farmers would be encouraged to combine to employ an accountant to keep their books on up-to-date lines.The Government is examining all these possibilities ofeconomic research and education and will consider whether furtherfunds should not be provided for the purpose.It may be added that the Secretary for Scotland hasalready appointed a Committee to advise on the organisation and finance of agricultural education and research in Scotland,Drainage.     It has been estimated that not less than,000,000 acres of land is seriously waterlogged and isconsequently producing much loss than it could if it was properlydrained.     The Government proposes to increase the provision of funds for drainage schemes and to extend the time during which such schemes can be carried out.
