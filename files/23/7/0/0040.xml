Railway Strike.Colonial Troops.Withdrawal ofProtectionCertificates.1. With reference to. War Cabinet 476, Minute 10, the War.Cabinet had under consideration a memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade dealing with the situation as regards therailway strike.The President of the Board of Trade said that, although thestrike had spread during the previous night and that morning, ithad not done so to the extent that had been anticipated.   In theNorth, the only further place affected was Liverpool, but in theSouth the strike had extended to the Great Eastern and SouthWestern Railways.    The traffic on the South. Western Railwaywas seriously interfered with, and there were not even enoughmen to handle an unusual number of ambulance trains.   troops were being moved into Newport, but this was the only movementof troops at present, although further arrangements had  beenmade.  No naval or military men were, up to the present, workingthe traffic.   There was not the slightest evidence of any disorder,and the police were dealing vigorously with picketing.   Sir Albert-Stanley said that he had spoken to both Mr. Bromley arid Mr.J. ET. Thomas on the telephone, and Mr. Bromley had informed him that, as the result of yesterday morning&apos;s meeting in Newport,it was felt that an impression had been made on the men, butfeeling had again hardened in the afternoon, and Mr. Bromleyhad said that he saw no hope of getting.the men back to work.Mr. J. H. Thomas had agreed with Mr. Bromley as to the feelings at the meeting, but had also said that in one part ofSouth   Wales   the   men   had   gone   back,    and   that   hewas hopeful  that  by  this  morning  more  men  would  have returned.   Sir Albert Stanley had told Mr. Thomas of the decisionof the War Cabinet, and he (Mr. Thomas) had expressed the hopethat the War Cabinet would not recede in any way from  theposition they had taken up in the decisions arrived at.   At themeeting yesterday afternoon of the Committee appointed by theWar Cabinet, the only point left over was with regard to the cancellation of protection certificates.   Unless the War cabinet decided to the contrary, it was proposed to take similar steps tothose taken during the strike at Coventry, and to warn the menthat if they did not return to work their protection certificateswould be cancelled.  The Commander-in-Chief of the Home forces had informed the Committee that there were 50,000 infantry avail-able, but of these about half were Colonial troops, and the Com-mittee had not considered that it was right that they, should beemployed for strike purposes.   The Press was unanimous againstthe strike, and reports had been received by the home Office tothe effect that public opinion was entirely against the strike.It was generally agreed that approval could not be given forthe use of Colonial troops, but some doubt was expressed as towhether it was advisable to give any warning of the cancellation of certificates, and whether notice should not be served on the menat once.Attention was called to the Parliamentary pledges which hadbeen given to trades unions with regard to the cancellation ofprotection certificates, but the opinion was generally expressed that, as this strike -was not a trade dispute connected with any industry by which a private employer would benefit, these pledgesdid not apply.The possibility of prosecuting or deporting the leaders of thestrike was discussed, but, while it was agreed that this coursewould have to be considered, it was pointed out that, at themoment, there were not outstanding figures who were leading the strikers, and that the principal leaders of the unions were allagainst the strike.A suggestion was also made that men coming home on leavefrom abroad, who were unable to reach their homes owing to the
124Strikeiof Clyde 2. The First Lord of the Admiralty called attention to theShipwrights. strike of the shipwrights on the Clyde, where a demand had beenput forward for a minimum wage of  5 a week. Equally with therailway strike, the men had come out against the advice of theirunions. About 3,000 men were affected, and the strike was serious, not only because of the importance of their work, but because work would accumulate and grave delay would be caused.i As the railway strike was undoubtedly the more serious, Sir eric geddes said that he did not propose to ask the War Cabinet forany decision as to the steps to be taken at the present time,but would bring the matter forward at.a later date if a settlementhad not been arrived at. It was hoped, however, that the strike would soon be settled.Seamen&apos;s Wages 3. The Wrar Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theand the Effect of      Ministry of Shipping (G.T.-5728) and a memorandum by the first the recent American   Lord of the Admiralty (Paper G.T.-5756), in regard to seamen&apos;s^ Advance in Pay.      wages and the effect of the recent American advance in pay.Sir Leo Money, chairman of the National Maritime Board,said that trouble had arisen in some of our ports as a direct resultof the recent big advance in American seamen&apos;s wages, which had now been raised by the United States National Shipping board to about 23Z. per month, including the bonus of 50 per cent., forwar-zone trading. This was twice the standard wage of 111. 10s.,as established by the British National Maritime Board. the scandinavian rate of pay, namely, about 15Z., was also higherthan ours. The Seam en&apos;s Union had now put forward a demand foran increase of 4i. per month, which would raise the A.B.&apos;s wageto 15Z. 10s. per month, as compared with the American 231. SirLeo Money pointed out that this suggested increase of 4Z. a monthwas greater than any asked for by any other section of labour,except the transport workers, who were asking for an increase of about4Z. 10s. If the seamen&apos;s demands were granted, there would bea reaction on the whole of the shore labour. He was strongly ofopinion that, if the advance were granted, it should be as a war-zone bonus to differentiate it from shore pay.Sir Joseph Maclay said that the position was undoubtedly! serious.   We were dealing with a class of men who had renderedparticularly faithful service throughout the war. Their wages inpre-war days were admittedly low. He was of opinion that an advance was necessary, and asked for the authority of the Cabinetto negotiate an increase in wages up to 4.Z., to be paid as a war-zone bonus, in order to avoid the possible reaction on shore labouralluded to by Sir Leo Money. He added that there could be little doubt but that the Americans were anxious to force our hands inthe matter, in order that, by raising seamen&apos;s wages here now,they might, after the war, compete better commercially against us.The First Lord said that, while not wishing to protest againstthe increase in wages to a class of labour who had behaved betterthan some other classes who had received higher wages with less. justification, he must point out that difficulties would be createdamongst naval ratings and in the Army by the granting of the advance.dislocation of the railways, should be utilised  with  the home forces and given their leave after the strike was over.The War Cabinet approved the cancellation of the protectioncertificates granted to railway workers who were on strike, and left to the decision of the Committee thedetails as to how the necessary action should be taken.
The President of the Board of Trade pointed out the reactionwhich the proposed increase would have on the railwaymen. Itwould be difficult to avoid giving the war-zone bonus to the crews of steamers owned by the railway companies and plying outsidethe war-zone, and this would immediately lead to demands for equal treatment by the railwaymen. In fact; the present railwaydispute was to some extent connected with the rates of pay givento the crews of railway steamers. He asked that the negotiations might be prolonged until after the railway strike was over.In this connection Sir Joseph Maclay stated that, if thequestion were not settled before the 1st October, he anticipatedtrouble.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To authorise the Shipping Controller to negotiate an advance in the seamen&apos;s wage up to 4Z. a month, ifnecessary, to be paid as a war-zone bonus ;(&amp;.) That the definition of &quot; war risk &quot; should be settledbetween the Admiralty and the Shipping Controller;(c.) That before negotiations as authorised in (a) are openedthe extent to which the advance should be appliedto the crews of the railway steamers should be settled by the Shipping Controller and the President of theBoard of Trade;(d.) That, if the President of the Board of Trade and theShipping Controller could not reach an agreement, thequestion should be referred back to the War Cabinet.Soldiers&apos;and 4. With reference to the previous minute, the War CabinetSailors&apos; Pay. 2ja(j their attention drawn to recent indications that there was a growing resentment against the Government on the part of thefighting forces in regard to the higher wages which were being paid to non-fighting men, as compared with their own, whichplaced the wives and families of non-fighters in a better financialposition.The War Cabinet decided that The Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee, under the chair -manship of Mr. Barnes, should be reassembled, in orderto see whether the separation allowances to the relativesand dependants of sailors and soldiers ought not now tobe increased.Palestine: 5. The Secretary of State for India drew the attention of the messages of War Cabinet to the fact that little mention had been made of theCongratulations.      part taken by the Indians in the recent operations in Palestine.The official communique referred to British Yeomanry, to dominion troops, and to the Jews, and Mr. Montagu understoodthat three-fourths of the infantry and one-fourth of the cavalryof our forces in Palestine consisted of Indians, but there was nothing in the press to show that the recent victory had been largely due to the Indian forces.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, althoughthe figures stated by the Secretary of State for India with regardto the proportion of Indian troops compared with British troops were correct, yet all that number had not been engaged, nor hadborne the brunt of the fighting. General Wilson sympathised withMr. Montagu&apos;s views on this matter.The question was then raised of sending a telegram -from theSecretary of State for India to General Allenby, congratulatinghim on his recent victory.
125Services of Colonel 6. With reference to War Cabinet 475, Minute 3, it wasLawrence. pointed out that the first recognition of Colonel Lawrence&apos;services with the King of the Hejaz had appeared in a Frenchnewspaper.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that ColonelLawrence had already received the C.B. and the D.S.O., but thathe would wire to General Allenby to find out whether it was pro-posed to recognise Colonel Lawrence&apos;s services still further.It was suggested that the reason for not giving wide publicity to the services rendered by Colonel Lawrence was, perhaps, regard for that officer&apos;s own personal safety.Palestine. 7. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that therewas no change in the situation west of the Jordan. East of the jordan the pursuit&apos; of the enemy was being continued, by australian and New Zealand mounted divisions, towards Amman.By midday on the previous day these troops had reached Suweileh,halfway between Es Salt and Amman. Between Amman andDeraa, the Arab army had continued to demolish the railway.The total captures reported up to the present were 40,000 prisoners and 265 guns.In reply to a question as to&quot; whether the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff had considered the possibility of a naval attack onBeirut, General Wilson said that this matter had been consideredby the General Staff, and he was under the impression that general allenby was discussing the possibilities of such an attack with admiral Jackson.8. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that our1st Groupment had everywhere crossed the Vardar, betweenHudova and Klisura. The Serbian troops north of the Vardar had reached the line Hadzi Seidli Cesmedere with cavalry towardsStip. Serbian, French, and Italian cavalry were being directed onUskub. Our Allies had captured three hospitals complete,together with thirty guns, eleven trains, 200 railway waggons,railway material, and ammunition supplies and aircraft stores.The British troops had captured twelve guns- to date.The Western 9- The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that therefront. was nothing to report on the Western front.   In our operationsround St. Quentin the previous day we had reached all our objec-tives, which, however, were limited.Mr. Montagu said he contemplated the despatch of two telegrams one which the King proposed to send to the Viceroy ofIndia, in regard to the terms of which His Majesty had consultedhim, and the other from himself to General Allenby but he had held up these telegrams until the War Cabinet had despatchedtheir telegram of congratulation (War Cabinet 476, Minute 4).The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that this tele-gram had been sent off on the previous day.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for India should instruct General Costo go to the War Office and frame, with their assistance,a telegram to the Viceroy, for submission to His Majesty,and that this telegram should make special mention ofthe part taken by the Indian troops in the recent operations.
10. With reference to Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig&apos;scommunique of the 23rd instant, in which he mentioned the fineexploit of a corporal and seven men belonging to the HighlandLight Infantry, who held out east of Mceuvres whilst surroundedhy the Germans, and were rescued by our troops when theyrecaptured that village, the question was*asked whether it was proposed to publish the names of these men.Tlie Chief of. the Imperial General Staff undertook to askField-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig whether there was any objection to this being done.Aerial Attack , 11. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that three enemy on Mudros. , aeroplanes carried out an attack on Mudros on the morning of the24th September. The seaplane station at Talikna had beendestro3&quot;ed, including ten seaplanes, three hangars, repair shops,and large quantities of stores. There were no casualties. bombs had also been dropped in Mudros East, one native being killed andtwo others wounded.Submarines:S.S. &quot; Edlington.&apos;S.S. &quot; Onward.&quot;12. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that the Commander-in-Chief , in the Mediterranean had reported that, on the 23rdSeptember, the stetimship &quot; Edlington,&quot; in convoy, was sunk by an. enemy, submarine in a position 75 miles from Cape Passero.H.M.S. &quot; Wetland&quot; had attacked the submarine with depth charges, and bad reported that when she left the vicinity oil was still rising to the surface.13. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that a fire had occurred on the mail-packet &apos;&apos; Onward,&apos;&apos; at Folkestone, and thatshe had sunk in the harbour, blocking up two berths. He fearedchat it would be some time before these two berths could be cleared.Control of allied forces in Siberia.14. With reference to War Cabinet 475, Minute 7, the WarCabinet had before them a draft telegram by Mr. Balfour (paper g-.T.-5755), regarding the control of Allied forces in Siberia,which it was proposed to send to Washington. &apos;Lord Reading said he had already discussed with Mr. Balfourthe advisability of sending this telegram, and had put before himone or two objections. Lord Reading then gave the War cabinet an outline of his objections, which were of a highly confidentialcharacter.Mr. Balfour said that his telegram did not touch the bigquestion of Allied policy in Siberia, but emphasised the fact that,whatever the Allies proposed to do in Siberia, could not be under-taken with the present machinery. Even if President Wilson hada very limited policy in Siberia, it would be necessary to have someInter-Allied organisation which could settle questions and issue orders speedily, and without constant reference to the Govern-ments concerned. Mr. Balfour said that he understood PresidentW7ilson would like to have some international organisation withits headquarters at Washington. At&apos; the present moment theUnited States were represented on several international organisa-tions which were either in this country or in France, and thePresident felt that he had little or no control over his representa-tives. Therefore Mr. Balfour was of the opinion that it might bea sound move diplomatically for the suggested Inter-AlliedSiberian Council to have its headquarters at Washington. Inaddition, he pointed out that President Wilson&apos;s interest would beenlisted, and even his honour would be to some extent involved indecisions taken at Washington.
Lord Reading said that he appreciated these points, and thought it would be a great advantage, and would please theUnited States, if the Council sat at Washington.Lord Curzon pointed out that the situation in Siberia was serious, and, unless machinery of some kind was set up to dealexpeditiously with the problems that arose in that country, therewas a danger of the whole movement petering out. He suggestedthat, although Vladivostock was undoubtedly the best place forthe proposed Council, we ought nevertheless to make a beau gesteby suggesting Washington. In his view, the proposal should be entirely dissociated from policy, and put forward simply as a useful piece of Inter-Allied machinery.Mr. Chamberlain suggested that we might put the proposal ofa Council to be. domiciled in Washington, in the first instance, to president Wilson only, and say that, if he approved, our other allies could then be consulted, either on the initiative of PresidentWilson or of the British Government, whichever he preferred.Admiral Hope stated, on behalf of the First Lord of theAdmiralty, that the present naval liaison at Versailles was work-ing very well, and the Admiralty would be satisfied, should theproposed Council materialise, if a similar liaison were institutedat &quot;Washington.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in consultationwith Lord Reading, should redraft the preface to theproposed telegram, to meet Lord Reading&apos;s objections,accentuating the point that the proposal was merely oneof machinery and entirely independent of the policy tobe adopted. Subject to the Prime Minister&apos;s approval,he should then send the telegram to President Wilsononly, in the first instance.Supply of Material 15. The War Cabinet had under consideration a note by theto Eussian Forces Chief of the Imperial General Staff (Paper G.T.-5772) relativein Siberia. to the supply of essential material to the Russian forces in Siberia,in which it was pointed out that, although the question of theresponsibility for the organisation of Russians is now under con-sideration by the French and British Governments, it was impera-tive that immediate action should be taken to proceed with theprovision and despatch of such articles of clothing and equipment as it may be possible for us to provide up to the limit of 100,000men.The Quarter-Master-General stated that the bulk of the cloth-ing and equipment required, with the exception of winter over-coats, relative to which, he would have to communicate with theCanadian authorities, could be got ready for conveyance in about ten days, that it would go via Canada and the United States ofAmerica, and would require but little shipping for its transport.The War Cabinet approved the provision and despatch toSiberia of such articles of clothing and equipment required for 100,000 men, asked for by General Knox,as it may be possible to provide.Purchase of Copper, 16. The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew the attention of&amp;c, in Australia.&apos; the War Cabinet to a difficulty which had arisen in regard topurchases from Australia chiefly copper and lead which cannotbe moved owing to shortage of snipping. He stated that a pro-posal had been made to buy these commodities for a certain period after the war, and mentioned that such was a question of policywhich could not be decided by the Treasury.
The War Cabinet decided To form a Committee to consider the question, of which mr. Chamberlain consented to be Chairman,assisted by: A representative of the Treasury.A representative of the Colonial Office.A representative of the Ministry of Munitions.A representative of the Board of Trade.A representative of the Ministry of Shipping.Mr. Andrew Weir.Co-ordination ofWork connectedwith Prisonersof War.17. With reference to War Cabinet 474, Minute 5 (c), theChancellor of the Exchequer informed the War Cabinet that sir george Cave had consented to act as the Chairman of the Inter-Departmental Prisoners of War Committee.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.September 25, 1918.o
