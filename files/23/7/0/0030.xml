Strike of Metro- 1. With, reference to the strike of the Metropolitan Police,politan Police. which had taken place during the previous night, General Smutsinformed the War Cabinet that he had summoned the Superin-tendents of the various districts to meet him at the Home Office that morning, and that every district had been represented. The demandsput forward by the men were : (a.) That the present war bonus of 12s. a week should be immediately increased to 11., and converted into per-inanent wage ; further, that a war bonus, calculated ona basis of 12-1- Per cent, on all wages and allowances,shoiud be granted in addition ;(b.) That ex-Constable Thiel, provincial organiser of the union,and delegate to the London Trades Council, who wasdismissed for taking part in the management of an&quot; unauthorised association,&quot; should be immediatelyreinstated without loss of pay or service ;(c.) Complete recognition of the Union and its officials.On being asked to state frankly their views on these demands,the Superintendents said they sympathised with the men as regards their claim for higher pay ; that, in their view, this claim was reasonable ; and that, unless this claim was conceded in toto, therewas no chance of a settlement of the dispute. As regards the reinstatement of Constable Thiel, they were not unanimous as tothis demand, but the feeling of the majority was that such reinstate-ment would practically amount to recognition of the Union, andthe majority Avere against conceding this demand. As to recogni-tion of the Union, the Superintendents were unanimous that itAvoidd be impossible to concede this demand. General Smutsexplained, AAuth regard to the demand for increased pay, that thisamounted to 15s. fid. a week for a constable, Avhich was made upby 8s. being added to the Avar bonus of 12s. already granted, and7s. fid. hy the 12J per cent, rise on their total emoluments. general smuts achbsed that this demand should be conceded, but not thatthe full 20s. should be incorporated into permanent pay and madepensionable. He suggested that an extra 10s. should be madepermanent pay.On asking the Superintendents whether, in their opinion, ifthe GoA^ernment announced this decision and called on the men toreturn, the men would come back to duty, the Superintendents said they expected they would, but at any rate so many Avould returnthat in all probability the demand for the recognition of the UnionAvould be dropped. General Smuts said that officials of theUnion came to see him while he Avas in conference with theSuperintendents at the Home Office, but, while he had expressed his Avillingness to see individual men, he had refused to see themin the capacity of members of the Union. Undoubtedly thesituation Avas very serious, as the Union Avas affiliated to other trades Unions, and there was a possibility of the stiuke extending to other trades.Major Sir F. Wodehouse, Assistant Commissioner of theMetropolitan Police, explained that before the war the pay of a con-stable on the highest rate was 37s. fid. per week, and, if the demandsof the men Avere conceded, constables Avould now be receiving about31. 7 s. fid. Shortly after the outbreak of war an increase of 3s. perweek Avas granted, and the subsequent war bonus had been increased from time to time. Mr. Tripp mentioned that it was undoubtedly a fact that the Lancashire and Liverpool Police were getting higher rates of pay than the Metropolitan Police. Sir F. Wodehousestated that demands had been put forward in the House ofCommons and to the Chief Commissioner for an increased rate off, pay, and the matter would have been dealt with earlier but for thefact that the Chief Commissioner was preparing a scheme for
3 wc 4eapensions for widows, which he desired to promulgate at the sametime as the increases of pay. Sir Frederick informed the WarCabinet that the strike was very serious, that every district was affected, and that he did not expect there would be any Police onnight duty that night. Questioned as to the Special Constables,Sir Frederick said there were about 20,000, but those who belonged to the working classes were all Union men and not to be depended on ; others were helping very well, and were out as early as 1 a.m.that morning.The Prime Minister said that apparently the Home Office had some knowledge that the men were dissatisfied. The men felt thatthey had a just claim, for an increase, and that the Government wasnot dealing fairly by them. He agreed that there was no doubtthat the concession as regards pay, suggested by General Smuts,should be given.Sir E. Blackwell, in reply to the Prime Minister, said that theHome Office had received no demands from the men for increasedpay until the letter from the Union of the 27th August, which wasreceived on the 28th. There had been a few questions in Parlia-ment in July, to which the Home Secretary replied that the matter was receiving his consideration.Mr. Chamberlain pointed out that, when the munition workerswent on strike, the Government said, very rightly, that exemption from military service was only given for work of national importance,and threatened to cancel exemption certificates if the men did not return to work. The present case was much more serious, as it wasa strike in a disciplined force, and, if the men went back on terms,in his opinion other police forces would come out.Questioned as to what assistance could be given by the militaryin the event of disturbances owing to the absence of Police, the adjutant-General said that he could arrange with the london district and Home Forces for military pickets to be standing by. tobe used in case of necessity. At the same time he thought it his duty to tell the War Cabinet that he had been informed that mostof the telephone wires to the police stations had been cut.It was agreed that no action could be taken until the return ofthe Home Secretary, but the opinion was generally expressed thatan announcement of an increase of pay should be made applicableto men who resumed duty by a certain date.The War Cabinet decided that No action could be taken in the absence of the HomeSecretary, but requested General Smuts to meet Sir GeorgeCave in conference immediately on his return to london that evening, the Prime Minister undertaking to calltogether such members of the War Cabinet as were avail-able, to consider the decisions arrived at by General Smutsand Sir George Cave, if necessity aroseThe Coal Situation: 2. AVith reference to War Cabinet 460, Minute 12, the WarRelease of Grade I Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the CoalMiners from the Controller on the subject of the release of Grade I miners from theArmy. army (Paper G.T.-5542).The President of the Board of Trade said that, in connectionwith the coal situation, he had no further figures to lay before the war Cabinet, other than those which were considered when thisquestion was last discussed in the Memorandum he had thencirculated (Paper G.T.-5410). The output of coal was stilldecreasing, owing mainly to the influenza epidemic and theI .  incidence of recruiting, whilst demands for more coal from manysources were increasing, and the requirements of our Allies and&apos;!&apos;- neutral countries were not being fully met.    Sir Albert Stanley
said that he had invited the Mine-owners&apos; Association to nominateone of their members to assist the Coal Controller. The Associationdid not, however, see their way to do this, but he had invitedSir Adam Nimmo, who had accepted. He had also sent an invita-tion to the Miners&apos; Federation, and had met Mr. Smillie and fourother members that morning. They had listened to his proposal,but had given no answer, although he gathered from theirattitude that they would not nominate anyone. A meeting of theExecutive of the Miners&apos; Federation was to be held on Monday next,when an answer would be sent. Sir Albert Stanley said that he intended to inform the press that Sir A. Nimmo had accepted, butthat no reply had been received from the Miners&apos; Federation.The Prime Minister, in the name of the War Cabinet, welcomedSir A, Nimmo, and asked him if it was possible, in his opinion, forthe coal output to be increased to an adequate degree withoutcalling men back from the forces.Sir Adam Nimmo said that he did not consider this was possible.Referring to the memorandum by the Coal Controller (paper g.T.-5410), he pointed out that this showed an estimated deficiency of 9,500,000 tons, on the assumption of an output of 236,000,000tons. Already this estimated output was falling behind to anamount which would, represent a shortage of 5,000,000 tons. Therewas also an increased demand from the Ministry of Food and theBoard of Agriculture for 1,000,000 tons. There w^as also theAmerican demand for 2,500,000 tons, but the Americans were alsoasking for greatly increased quantities in France. It was thereforeonly reasonable to add a further 2,000,000 tons to the Americandemand, making a total of 4,500,000 tons. Amongst the decreaseddemands shown in the memorandum, the stocks at pits and consumers&apos; stocks, totalling 6,000,000 tons, had been taken credit for. A most unfortunate situation would be created if all these stocks were used up, as a very dangerous labour position mightensxie.. It was therefore desirable only to take credit for 3,000,000instead of 6,000,000 tons. Consequently, when all these totals were taken into consideration, there would be an estimated shortage of20,000,000 tons instead of 9,500,000 tons. With regard to theestimated increases in output, the memorandum had taken credit for 14,000,000 tons lost in 1917 through lack of shipping facilities. This was a very optimistic estimate, and, while itmight be agreed that the greater proportion could be made good,it must be assumed that there would be some dislocation, andit was not unreasonable to estimate 10,000,000 tons as an estimated increase. For the sake of argument, therefore, it must be said thatthe shortage would be 20,000,000 tons, while it might be 24,000,000.There was nothing that could be done in the country to meet thisshortage by reducing absenteeism or increasing individual effort.If a good atmosphere was created among the miners, this would only stop leakages and would not in any way make up the shortage.The Coal Controller had asked for 50,000 men, 25,000 of whom wereto be Grade I and the remainder of a lowrer category. Sir A. Nimmosaid that he considered this number insufficient and that the coal controller should be given an equivalent of 50,000 Grade I men.This would mean a gain of 18,000,000 tons of coal, and it was hoped that, while it would not be an easy task, the differencebetween the 18,000,000 tons and the estimated shortage could bebridged over. The men were wanted at once, not only for thewinter, but for permanent wrork in the mines. Sir A. Nimmoexpressed the opinion that, uidess coal were provided to meetessential demands, there would be grave labour difficulties.Questioned as to the prospects of industrial rationing of coal, hesaid that this proposal must be treated very carefully and scientifi-cally, in order to avoid confusion. The reason why it had not beenpossible to maintain the pre-war level of output per man was
that nearly 400,000 of the most virile miners had been taken andthe mines had been left with men who were not so capable.The Prime Minister said that the question which must be con-sidered by the Admiralty and the War Office was whether, with regardto our war effort, a reduction of men or of raw material was the mostserious. In his opinion the War Cabinet should be fully informed of all the necessary figures in this connection, and he suggested thatthe Chancellor of the Exchequer should hold a conference with the heads of all Departments concerned, and, after carefully examining the matter, should advise the War Cabinet.In the discussion on the proposal put forward in the memo-randum by the Board of Trade (Paper G.T.-5542), that the last25,000 miners called up for the Army, the Navy, and the RoyalAir Force should be at once traced and returned to their collieriesby the 30th September, 1918, the Minister of National Servicepointed out that many of these young miners taken since Aprilwere in the Navy and the Royal Air Force. It was not, therefore,a question of taking so many men from the Army, for if this were done they would not return to the mines in proportionate numbers.(At this stage of the meeting the Minister of Munitions entered.)The Minister of Monitions, in reply to questions as to how theshortage would affect his Department, said that he sincerely trustedthat the Ministry of Munitions would not alone haA-e to bear this burden. Undoubtedly pressure might result in economy withouta proportionate falling off in munition output, and such pressureshould be exerted to the fullest extent. It might even be advisable to propose some system of rewards for the production of the sameoutput with a less consumption of coal. At the same timeMr. Churchill strongly expressed the opinion that every branchmust be equally taxed, and he strongly urged the claims of Italy toan increased supply for her requirements. Before giving an answer to the question as to what the effect on his department would be he would like to prepare a statement, to be laid beforethe War Cabinet, shewing in detail the reduction of the munitionoutput in proportion to the reduction of coal allowed to his Depart-ment.The War Cabinet decided that A Conference, to be presided over by the Chancellor of theExchequer, and attended by the Heads of all the Depart-ments concerned, should be held at 10, Downing Street,at 11*30 a.m. on the following day, to consider fully thewhole question, and report to the War Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,August 31, 1918.o
