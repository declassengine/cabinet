Search had been carried out by all available vessels,but no trace had been found of her, nor had she answered anywireless signals.   It was therefore presumed that she was lost.Loss of Hospital 3  The First Sea Lord reported that ELMS. &quot; Lysander &quot; hadShip &quot;Llandovery ^ picked up one boat containing twenty-four survivors of the hospital ship &quot; Llandovery Oastle,&quot;  which   had   been  torpedoed  on the27th June in a position about 116 miles W.S. W. from Fastnet Rock.H.M.S. &quot;Snowdrop &quot; was leaving Berehaven in order to search forsurvivors of the &quot; Llandovery Castle.&quot;Aeroplane D.H. 9,No. 7620.4. The First Sea Lord said that our Xaval Attache at TheHague had reported that aeroplane D.H. 9, No. 7620, had landed in holland owing to injury to her engines.

The First Sea Lord said- that the Rear-Admiral, HarwichForce, reported that the coastal motor-boats under his orders hadbeen operating to the northward of Terschelling Island (Holland)during the 30th June. Attacks had been made on enemy submarines and mine-sweepers ; one sweeper was believed to have been torpedoed All the motor-boats had returned safely, but twoaeroplanes that were co-operating were lost through engine failures.There had been no casualties to the crews.Submarines.6. With reference to War Cabinet 435, Minute 6, the First sea lord gave fuller particulars of the engagement in &quot;which an enemy submarine had been hunted during nearly twenty-four hours.Indian Reforms: 7.   With reference to War Cabinet 430, Minute 6, the WarPublication of Joint Cabinet had before them a note by Mr. Chamberlain (Paper G-.T.-Eeport. 4956) entitled &quot; The Situation in India.&quot;The War Cabinet decided that  As the matter was one of great importance, requiring the most careful consideration, and as it could not be decided in theab ence of the Prime Minister, who had to proceed at once to France to attend a Session of the Supreme War Council,the discussion of Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s paper and the points raised in it should be adjourned to a future meeting.Bepork. on the 8. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn by Lord CurzonBeform of the to a question which had been put.down for discussion in the HouseHouse of Lords. Gf Lords on the subject of the Report of the Committee presided overby Lord Bryce in connection with the House of Lords Reform, andLord Curzon asked for the instructions of the War Cabinet as to the reply which he should give.
Supreme War. 9. The Prime Minister said that he was only entitled to theCouncil. presence of one Cabinet Minister at the meetings of the supreme war Council, and expressed the opinion that, in view of the manysubjects which were to be discussed affecting foreign affairs, itwould be advisable for the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs tobe the Minister appointed by the War Cabinet to be present withhim at the meetings, the Secretary of State for War being called inwhen required.The War Cabinet agreed with the proposal of  the PrimeMinister.Man-power:Volunteers forSpecial Service.10. The attention of the War Cabinet was called to amemorandum by the Minister of National Service on the subject of13,000 Volunteers being asked to offer themselves for whole-time service for a period of not less than two mouths (Paper G.T.-4967).The Prime Minister said that he had understood from the under-Secretary of State for War that this question had been settled.In view of statements made in the memorandum The Secretary was instructed to request the Secretary of Statefor War to -forward a statement on the question for theconsideration of the War Cabinet.(At this stage the prime Minister withdrew from the meeting.At a later stage in the proceedings, Mr. Prothero stated that the calling up of an additional number of agricultural labourers at thepresent time, when their services were most required, had created avery serious situation.It was pointed out by Sir Auckland Geddes that the War office had pledged itself not to take such Volunteers from barredoccupations, but Mr. Prothero stated that such men.had been taken.Sir Auckland Geddes expressed the opinion that this action ofthe War Office was the most serious thing that had happened forthe Ministry of National Service.In view of the absence of Lord Milner and the Under-Secretaryof State for War, the War Cabinet decided that Any further discussion on this question should be deferred until the following day, when the Under-Secretary of Statefor War could be present.Release of Agri- 11- With reference to War Cabinet 436, Minute 14, the Warcultural Labourers Cabinet had under consideration a memorandum by the Secretary(Scotland). for Scotland on the subject of the release of Scottish agricultural labour from military service (Paper G.T.-4975).The Secretaiy for Scotland asked for the same treatment whichhad been accorded to England by the decision of the War Cabineton the 26th June, 1918, to be meted out to Scotland. Mr. Munrosaid that, whereas it had been decided that 30,000 agricultural labourers should be released for military service in England,Scotland had been required to provide 5,500, which was inexactmathematical proportion. He understood that the War cabinet had now consented to the reduction of this number of 30,000 toThe Prime Minister said that the War Cabinet had had no time to consider this Report, which was undoubtedly a most8! valuable one.The War Cabinet requested :Lord Curzon to give an answer to that effect when the question was raised.
24,000, or 20 per cent. Ipps than the original figure, which meant that the equivalent, reduction for Scotland would be 1,100.Mr. Munro stated that, not having been called to the WarCabinet at which the decision on English agricultural labour was arrived at, he had not had an opportunity of putting forward the case for Scotland. He urged that it was obviously right and just for Scotland to be treated equally with England. Thesituation of Scotland as regards agriculture would be exceedinglygrave even if 1,100 men out of the quota of 5,500 were not taken.Telegrams had been received, questions were being asked in theHouse, indignation meetings among farmers were being held, all onthe subject of the dislocation of agricultural labour, which was far beyond what had been expected by the Scottish Board of Agricul-ture. Mr. Munro expressed the opinion very strongly that, ifScotland were treated in a different manner from that in which england had been treated, the prestige of the Scottish Board of agriculture would be lowered, as would also that of the Ministry of NationalService, which was the consenting party to the agreement arrivedat. Mr. Munro said that he had been in communication with theMinister of National Service, who had suggested that agriculture inScotland would not be really hurt by providing the full quota of5,500, but, the word of the President of the Board of Agriculturehaving been accepted as regards the effect on England, he claimedthe same right as representing the Scottish Board of Agriculture.Food production in Scotland had already diminished, and he wasvery apprehensive as to the effect on future food production ifScotland were not treated, as regards agricultural labourers, in thesame way as England.The Minister of National Service stated that there was greatdifficulty in getting men for the army from all the vital industries Ihe only industries in which available men were now left. Nofigures had at present been obtained, but, from information whichhe had received, Sir Auckland Geddes said that the number of english agricultural labourers who would be released by the decisionof the War Cabinet would be very small. The principal effect would be felt in Wales, where the position was extraordinary. InCardigan feeling was so strong that farmers had threatened to turncattle into the crops. The question of the release of men for agriculture in Scotland had been under discussion long before thequestion of any release of agricultural labourers in England hadbeen raised this year. At that time it had been shown that Scotlandcould release about 7,000 men without hindering agriculture, but no decision had been arrived at until after the English quota had been fixed. He was not aware that the number of &apos;5,500 had been fixedupon any proportional basis. Sir Auckland Geddes further pointedout that, as regards Scottish agricultural labourers, all the men called up in accordance with the quota called upon had, he under-stood, been posted by the previous day, the 30th June, so that adecision arrived at now for Scotland on the same lines as that for england would have practically no effect at all.Mr. Bonar Law agreed with the Secretary for Scotland that itwas most desirable that there should be no differentiation betweenthe treatment of England and Scotland, and suggested that thedecision arrived at by the War Cabinet with regard to england should apply to Scotland.The President of the Board of Agriculture and fisheries saidthat the statement of the number of agricultural laboiirers to becalled on from England and Wales would be reduced from 30,000 to:M,000, by reason of the War Cabinet decision on this subject, wasnot correct. As a.matter of fact, the reduction would be very small.Mr. Prothero stated that cases had occurred in Wales and Preston,where notices had been served on the 2!Sth, but antedated to the20th June, and Sir Auckland Geddes replied that, when he hadbeen informed of these cases, he had immediately given instructions for the cancellation of these calling-up notices.
Mr. Bonar Law said that, at the Cabinet meeting when thisquestion had been previously discussed, the War Cabinet hadreadily recognised the difficulties of administration by the Ministryof National Service, and had realised that relief could only be givenby the cancellation of calling-tip notices, but that it was impossibleto release men who had already joined the colours.Mr. Mtynro urged that it was necessary for him to be in aposition to give an answer to any questions on this subject to theeffect that Scotland had been treated in exactly the same way as england, and suggested that at any rate an agreement as to the cancellation of calling-up notices for Scotland should be dated backto the truth June, when the notices for England were cancelled.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) Any calling-up notices issued to men employed in agri-culture in Scotland (as defined in agreement betweenthe Ministry of National Service and the Board ofAgriculture for Scotland) if issued after the 26th June,or if the envelope containing the notice bears a post-mark of a date later than the 26th June, should be cancelled, and no more such notices should be issueduntil after the harvest.(6.) War Cabinet decision 436, Minute 14, should not apply inthe case of absentees as regards England and Wales.Government 12. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandnm preparedEstablishments: in the Treasury (Paper G.-213), together with a note by Lord MilnerThe Whitley on the memorandum (Paper G.-214).Report. Mr. Stanley Baldwin said that the memorandum was the resultof a meeting over which he had presided at the Treasury, when ithad been agreed that the question had reached a stage when themain issues involved might properly be submitted to the WarCabinet for decision. The first question was whether the recom-mendations could be applied at all. even with modifications, toGovernment establishments, or whether the conditions of Govern-ment employment were so different from those of outside industries as to preclude the application of the recommendations to Govern-ment establishments. He was of opinion that, if it were decided toapply the Whitley Report to Government establishments, certain conditions must be borne in mind ; there should be as littleinterference as possible with Treasury control, and.also with theresponsibility of Ministers. With a view to securing this end, itwas submitted that certain conditions suggested in the memorandum should be insisted, on in order to limit the subjects discussed in committee. For instance, any Joint Committees set up should be purely consultative, and should not be vested with any executive&quot;powers. They should not be free to discuss questions of manage-ment or policy. Their scope should be strictly limited to matters which directly affect the conditions of service of the staff. Questionsof discipline and promotion &apos; should be definitely excluded.Mr. Stanley Baldwin pointed out that some Departments, particularly the four main spending Departments, viz., the Admiralty, the WarOffice, the Ministry of Munitions, and the Ministry of Air, wereDepartments to which the recommendations of the Whitley report could most usefully be applied. The Post Office was in a rather different position, owing to the difficulty of drawing a line, in some -cases, between the manufacturing and clerical departments.Mr. lllingworth agreed that the Whitley Report should beapplied to Government Departments generally, subject to modi-fications.Mr. Forster urged that the Government should organise itself as one employer by means of a strong Inter-Departmental Com-mittee, and that the matter should not be left to the different
Departments, because he believed that the Whitley scheme tended to increase the power of the Trades Unions.Mr. Roberts was of opinion that the War Cabinet shouldendorse in principle the policy suggested in the memorandum(Paper G.-213), and that an interdepartmental Committee shouldbe appointed to consider what modifications were required as affecting each Department. He urged that the greatest possible measure of co-ordination should be arrived at among the Depart-ments concerned.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To adopt in principle the application of the recommenda-tions of the Whitley Report, with any necessary adaptations, to Government establishments where theconditions are sufficiently analogous to those existing in outside industries.(6.) That an Interdepartmental Committee, composed of repre-sentatives of the following Departments, should be setup to consider what modifications were necessary : Mr. Roberts (Minister&apos;of Labour), in the Chair,The Admiralty,The War Office,The Ministry of Munitions,The Ministry of Air,The Post Office,The Office of Works,The Treasury.(c.) That the Committee should consult Mr. Whitley in thecourse of their work.Loch Doon 13. Mr. Bonar Law called attention to a question which was to beAerodrome. asked in the House of Commons with reference to the responsibility which might rest on individual officers in connection with theconstruction of the aerodrome at Loch Doon.The War Cabinet decided that An answer should be given to the effect that it had beendecided that no action should be taken involving disciplinarypunishment in connection with any individual officer whowas concerned in the erection of the aerodrome at LochDoon.(Initialled) A.
