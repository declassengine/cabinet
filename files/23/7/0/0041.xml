Railway Strike.  - ]. WITH reference to War Cabinet 477, Minute 1, the WarCabinet had under consideration a memorandum by the President ofthe Board of Trade (Paper G.T.-5784) giving- the latest informationas regards the railway strike.The President of the Board of Trade said that in South wales the situation had considerably improved since yesterday, but inother parts of the country the position, on the whole, was not so good as it was last night. There had not been sufficient time, however,for the announcement made by the Unions, requesting the men toreturn to work, to take effect, and a great deal would depend on the news received to-day. In reply to a suggestion that it was desirablethat a press announcement should be made to the effect that Servicemen were volunteering to work the railways, Sir Albert Stanley saidthat arrangements had been made on the previous day to announce this in the press, and also the decisions which had been taken with. regard to the cancellation of protection certificates, and the injunctionobtained against the use of Union funds, but it had not been givento the press as Mr. .J. H. Thomas had informed him that the menwere going back, and it therefore seemed desirable to hold back theannouncement for a time. In answer to another suggestion that, ifthe railway strikers were called up, men should be released from france to take their places, Sir Albert explained, that Sir Sam Fayhad told the Strike Committee, held yesterday, that some 18,000 men could be sent home for this purpose as soon as they were replacedin France.The Minister of National Service said that a proposal had beenmade at the Strike Committee yesterday to add to the announcement to be issued cancelling protection certificates, words to the effectthat a percentage of the men would be called up by age groups, asthe Government might decide. Sir Auckland Geddes suggestedthat the following words might also be added : &quot; and as men couldbe brought back from the army to take their place.&quot; When action was taken dealing with protection certificates in Coventry, only alimited number of men were affected, but if all the railwaymen inSouth Wales were recruited a very difficult situation would be&quot;created, as local knowledge was essential to locomotive men on this very complicated railway system, and probably the Admiralty would get no coal.Sir Albert Stanley said that it was most important, as a pledgehad already been given that there should be no victimisation, Therailway managers had emphasised the gravity of the step whichwould be taken if protection certificates were cancelled ; for, if the:,    . men in any number remained out, the railways would be crippledfor very many months, which would result in the permanentcrippling of all our operations.The Adjutant-General informed the War Cabinet that Field-,. Marshal Sir Douglas Haig was anxious to know if leave from france should be stopped.It was pointed out that the position on the South-WesternRailway was Avorse than anywhere else, and at one important centrethe drivers had announced that they would move trains fromSouthampton, but would not move any troop trains to that port.The War Cabinet decided that The Strike Committee, at a meeting to be held that afternoon,should have full power to decide, after receiving the latest information as to the situation, whether notices cancellingprotection certifiates for men on strike on a certain date tobe decided on, should be issued, and whether it was advis-able to inform Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig that leave-for the Expeditionary Force should be stopped.
3,WC 478   1   oStrike of Clyde 2. With reference to War Cabinet 4-77, Minute 2, the First-Shipwrights; Lord of the Admiralty said that the situation as regards the strike ofshipwrights on the Clyde was slightly different from that of therailway strike, in that there had been no settlement on the wagesquestion with the Government, but that the Committee on production had already fixed a day when it was proposed to dealt ... . . with this question.   Mr. Wilkie, of the Shipwrights&apos; Union, was pressing hard for a Government announcement, and the Employers&apos;and YY&apos;or.kmen&apos;s Union was asking the Government to take action.As in the railway strike, to cancel protection certificates wouldcripple, to a certain extent, the shipbuilding industries, as therewas already a shortage of shipwrights and it would not be possibleget men to take their places.Sir Robert Home explained the whole situation, and said thatpractically the whole of the Clyde was out, with the exception of port Glasgow and Ardrossan. This was a widespread attempt tosecure a minimum wage of bl. a week, and the Secretary of the clyde District Committee of the Engineering and ShipbuildingTrades had issued a document enclosing a ballot-paper asking for a vote on three points :  (a.) Whether the men were in favour of a 51. a week minimum.(6.) If so, would they stop overtime if it were not granted,(c.) Would they stop work if it were not granted.In this document, emphasis was laid on the fact that this Avasan economic claim for all Avorkers, skilled, semi-skilled, and unskilled.Sir Robert explained that this strike was not only contrary to theadvice of the Shipwrights&apos; Union, but the demand had already beenconsidered and rejected by the Federation of the Engineering and shipbuilding Trades, to Avhich the men belonged. An alternativeclaim had been put forward for a 15s. weekly flat rate advance,which was to be dealt with in the regular course by the Committeeon Production in October. Mr. Wilkie, the General Secretary of theShipAvrights&apos; Association, had informed Sir Robert that they were taking a ballot of their trade in the Glasgow district to discover ifthe majority of the men really agreed with the decision not to resumework which had been carried at the meetings held on the previousSaturday. The result of this ballot would not be known till Saturday.On the 25th September a meeting Avas held of the National JointCommittee of the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation and theShipping and Trade Unions. This organisation was formed as theresult of a deputation to the Prime Minister by the employers and employees for the purpose of adjusting any disputes arising in the shipyards and avoiding stoppages of work. At the meeting of theJoint Committee three employers Avere present, and five representa-tives of the shipyard trades. The Committee had agreed that theyhad come to an end of their resources, and that the time had uoavarrived when they must receive the support of the G0A&quot;ernment, andthat they, on their side, Avould support the Government in any act itmight choose to take. With regard to a possible remedy, Mr.Wentworth, who Avas a representatiA^e of the Wood Machinists&apos;Society, had put forward the proposal that the men who Avould notwork should be taken for the army, and this proposal was assentedto. It had also been stated that to prosecute individuals Avas useless,as it merely tended to create martyrs and heroes. A letter had beenreceived from Lord Pirrie, aaJio had been to Glasgow, which had stated that the trouble had originated at YarroAv&apos;s, and had been caused mainly by Socialists who had come from London. LordPi trie thought it Avould be prudent hot to act hastily, but subject tothis he agreed that action should be taken, and that it might be a-. good idea to call up all men on strike under the age of 23.The Minister of Munitions said that the threat of cancelling- : . protection certificates in the Coventry strike had been extremelyeffective: so much so, that everybody Avas back at work by the
time named, except about 50 men, and of these, several had tele-graphed, regretting their absence, and saying that they were making their way back. Mr. Churchill expressed the opinion that the cancellation of protection certificates was the proper course to pursue, and that when this action was taken at Coventry it hadreceived the warm approval of the country. It was necessary forthe Ministry of National Service to make all preparations as was done there, so that the men would know the Government reallymeant to take action.Sir Stephenson Kent said that the strike feeling was spreadingthrough the munitions industries, and that he expected serious location in aircraft production very shortly.It was generally agreed that a decision as to whether noticescancelling protection certificates should be issued depended on therailway situation, and also that it was not possible for effective actionto recruit the men to be taken before Monday next.Mr. Chamberlain expressed the opinion that the time had arrived when all Government Departments interested should meet together and prepare a document for publication, stating thecircumstances in which the Government considered it necessary to cancel protection certificates. It should be laid clown that therewere certain industries vital to the War, and that the Governmentcould not, and would not, tolerate a strike of men in these industrieswho were given protection from military service solely in order thatthey could carry out imperative work. If, therefore, they did notresort to the proper method of redress, the Government would atonce cancel the certificates of such men.The question of the Parliamentary pledges which had beengiven to Trades Unions was discussed, but it was pointed out thatthis strike was not within the purview of the pledges granted.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Admiralty should summon a Committee, which should meet that afternoon, composed of representatives of thefollowing Departments : -The Ministry of Labour.The Ministry of Munitions.The Board of Trade.The Ministry of National Service.(i.) To co-ordinate the activities of the various Depart-ments in dealing with the strikes ; also(ii.) To draw up a statement, announcing the intentionof the Government to cancel the protectioncertificates of such shipyard workers as are wilfullyabsent from work on Monday next, and setting forth in full the reasons for this action; this statement to be first submitted to the Prime Minister, and published as soon as he had approved it.(&amp;.) TheAdmiralty should keep the press fully informed as tothe facts in regard to the strike, in the same way as hasbeen done in the case of the Coventry strike and railway strike.The Western Front. 3, The Director of Military Operations reported that Frenchand American troops started a new attack this morning on either side of the Argonne. The Americans were on the right of the line,from the Meuse to the Argonne, the French on the left of the line,from the Argonne to the Suippe. Not including the Argonne, whichwas very difficult country for operations, the total width of the presentattack was about 20 miles. The Director of Military Operationssaid that the battle appeared to be going very well, and little opposi-tion was being met with. This looked as though the Germans wereprepared for an attack, and were only holding an outpost line, their
WC 478line of resistance being further in rear. Questioned as to the objectives of the present attack,, the Director of Military Operationssaid that it would, if successful, ease the situation at Rheims, and facilitate a further advance towards Metz. There was no very important objective on this front short of Mezieres.German Deserters.4. With regard to the mention in Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s telegram on the previous day of 100 German deserters who walked acrossinto our line , opposite St. Quentin, the Director of MilitaryOperations undertook to ascertain to what regiment these menbelonged, and to report this, with other details, to the War Cabinet.Palestine.5. The Director of Military Operations reported that general allenby&apos;s forces had occupied Tiberias and the southern end of theSea of Galilee. Oh the eastern side of the Jordan we had takenAmman, and the Arabs had occupied Maan. The effect of this wasto cut the Turkish 4th Army in two, and it was unlikely that, ariyformecl body of this army, which consisted of between&apos; 6,000 and,000 men, would be able to get away.In answer to a question as to whether we had taken any german prisoners, the Director of Military Operations said that he had hadno information on this point. In the srunmer the Germans had moved one whole regiment and one, battalion from Palestine to theWestern front, and it was thought that three Jager battalions still remained in Palestine..It was suggested that, if we had taken German prisoners, it-would be well to advertise the fact. If, on the other hand, theGermans had succeeded in detaching themselves from the mainTurkish force and mating their escape, this fact would make thesubject of good propaganda leaflets to drop ever Constantinople.With regard to British casualties, the Director of MilitaryOperations seated that their total, hot counting officers, only reached4,500, which was less than one-tenth of the total captures ofprisoners.The Director of Military Operations undertook to make enquires as to! the German prisoners.Macedonia.6. The Director of Military Operations reported that theBritish Army had crossed the frontier into Bulgaria, opposite Kos-turino. This meant that Valuable high ground had fallen into our possession. Questioned a&apos;s to why so few prisoners had beentaken&apos; in the advance, the Director of Military Operations said thatfew prisoners could be expected from a withdrawing army, in thecircumstances, as heavy fighting had only taken place on a relativelynarrow front, arid the forces on either flank had then withdrawn-without very serious resistance, but he thought that the Serbiansmight have taken a&apos; cortsiderable number. The Director of MilitaryOperations added that three German battalions from the Ukraine,and one from Roumania, had been sent to reinforce the Bulgarians.the  Situation irtPtissia :Publication ofForeign office telegrams.7. The,War Cabinet had before them a inemorandum by theMinister of Information, urging the desirability pf publishing in thepress abroad such parts of the Foreign Office telegrams dealing withthe state of Russia as the Foreign Office will permit.Lord Beaverbrook said that there was considerable information in the Foreign Office telegrams about the internal condition ofRussia, the publication of which would be most useful as propaganda,and would produce a great revulsion of feeling throughout the Alliedworld against those who were hindering our war effort.

The
Ministry *of Information would submit in advance to the ForeignOffice the material it was proposed to use.Mr. Balfour said that he was anxious to give the greatest possiblepublicity to the horrors of which the Bolsheviks had been guilty,provided that could be done without endangering the lives ofBritish subjects still in Russia, or compromising the persons whohad supplied the information, particularly neutral diplomatists. Itmight be desirable to delay publication until we received corrobora-tion of the stories which had reached us. He offered no objection,however, in principle, to publication, in view of Lord Beaverbrook&apos;sproviso that the text of any announcement should first be submittedto the Foreign Office.The War Cabinet gave their approval to the proposal of theMinister of Information, on these conditions.Press Reports of 8. With reference to War Cabinet 475, Minute 6, the Warthe Doings of Cabinet had before them a letter from the Minister of InformationColonial troops.       tQ t]iQ gecretary of the War Cabinet (Paper G.T.-5765), in which lord Beaverbrook asked if the War Cabinet would instruct themilitary authorities (a.) To give him the names of officers and men of all rankswho perform any specially conspicuous action or service at the time of the event, and not, as now, only the names from Lieutenant-Generals and upwards.(b.) To release for publication the casualty totals.(c.) To allow due prominence, in names and details, to be givento the work of our distinguished airmen.Lord Beaverbrook said that, with reference to the airmen, he understood that Lord Weir took strong objection to naming &quot; ace &quot;men. He wished to draw the particular attention of the WarCabinet to the fact that the suppression of names was having a veryadverse effect on public opinion in Canada and the United States ofAmerica, and was leading to an entirely false idea of the magnitude of British effort. The Dominion of Canada had contributed largely in personnel to the Royal Air Force, and, as it heard of nothing butthe exploits of its own airmen, it was now being stated in Dominionnewspapers that 75 per cent, of the &quot;fighting airmen&quot; wereCanadians.Lord Reading said that the Australian and Canadian troops were receiving a quite disproportionate recognition, and the lack of adequate publicity for the doings of our own troops was responsiblefor a certain strain of anti-British feeling current in the UnitedStates of America. Official bulletins were too impersonal to kindlethe interest of the Americans, who delighted in picturesqueindividual detail. The American Chief of Staff published everyweek in the States particulars of the position of each Americandivision, of the divisions which had been in the line, and the names of the Generals in command. This information was struck out inthis country by the American censor.Lord Curzon said that, when Chairman of the Air Board, hehad on several occasions discussed the publication of names with themilitary and naval authorities. The authorities were strongly opposedto publication, on the ground that men whose names were selected for publication for conspicuous feats were not necessarily braver or moredeserving than others who performed more humdrum but equallyrisky duties. Further, he was assured that the men themselves wereagainst publication. A compromise was attempted, under whichthe War Office and the Admiralty permitted a partial disclosure of the identity of men who had rendered specially gallant services,but the compromise was found unsatisfactory and was dropped.
Priority in 9. The War Cabinet endorsed the following resolutions whichDepartmental had &quot;been passed by the War Priorities Committee at their 21stCoMtruftioT8        MeetinS&apos; held on the 6th September, 1918 (Paper G.T.-5665) :--Programmes. (a.) That the War Priorities Committee should issue instructions that no new works or extensions to works shall be startedexcept such as are immediately necessary for winningthe war, and that any exception that it may be sought tomake to this rule shall be brought to the notice of theWar Priorities Committee only on the personal authorityof the Minister of the Department in question.(6.) That each Department shall be instructed to carry out a thorough investigation into its manufacturing and con-struction programme, having in view the alteredconditions now obtaining with regard to the man-powerand supply of material and fuel that may be looked upon as likely to be available for managing, equipping, and maintaining the works entailed by the programme.That, as a result of this investigation, departments should be instructed to report within a fortnight to theWorks Construction Sub-Committee the works now inhand, whether graded or not, which, in the opinion ofthe Departments, require a high priority, and also thosewhich, in view of the altered conditions, might be post-poned. That, on receiving the reports, the War priorities committee should decide wdiether any regrading isnecessary.2, Whiteliall Gardens, S.W.,September 26, 1918.oThe War Cabinet were strongly impressed with the arguments which had been brought forward in favour of departing from what had hitherto been the British practice. In view of the fact that theAllies were fighting as one army, and that the publication of namesby the Dominion Governments and the American Government, andthe withholding of names by ourselves was causinsr an entirelymisleading estimate of the British effort, it was desirable to examineour practice afresh.The War Cabinet requested Mr.   Chamberlain  to  assemble   a   Committee,  composed ofrepresentatives of The Admiralty,The War Office,The Air Ministry,The Ministry of Information,Mr. Pembroke Wicks (Secretary),to examine the whole question and report.
