September 1918.SECRET.qWWAR CABINET,  475.Minutes of a Meeting of the War Cabinet held at 10, Downing Street, S.W., on Friday,September 20, 1918, at 12 noon.Present:The Right Hon. A. Bonar Law, M.P. (in the Chair).The Right Hon. G. N. Barnes, M.P.The Right Hon. A. Chamberlain, M.P.The Right Hon. the Earl Curzon orKedleston, KG., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E.The following were also present :-The Right Hon. A. J. Balfour, CM.,M.P., Secretary of State for foreing affairs.General Sir H. H. Wilson, K.C.B.,D.S.O., Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff.Rear-Admiral   G.   P.   W.

Wilson, C.M.G., D.S.O., M.P., Assistant Secretary.The Western 1. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that twenty--^ront- one German divisions had been used during the last thirty-sixhours&apos; fighting on the Western front against the attack launchedby the Hlrd and Ivth  Armies. These divisions were evidently verytired, and were divisions some of which had been put in a second time. At the most, the number of British divisions employed could have been fifteen, but it was not clear whether this - number hadbeen used in full. The Germans had thought that their counter-offensive would stop our attack, but it had been entirely unsuccess-ful in doing so. The Germans had attacked in close formation, andhad suffered very heavy punishment indeed. On the whole, our operations had been eminently successful, and up to 3&apos;30 p.m. onthe previous day the capture of 10,000 prisoners had been reported.The strategic value of the attack lay in the fact that the advancegave the British forces two positions of observations which wereinvaluable for any possible future operations.[1365-475]  .....------------: ---^r-. ^JlHiBlHiMUkllUlliiBBIUftlilUMII^^yB^kv^L- &quot;-7-&quot;---
Enemy Movements. 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that heavytroop train movements had been observed from the west to theeast on the Western front, passing through Liege. General Wilsonexpressed the opinion that these trains were moving severaldivisions to Alsace, as General Ludendorff was undoubtedly gettingvery anxious about the American force in that district. information had been received which looked as though Mtilhausen and Metz werebeing cleared.Palestine. 3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, from information received, it appeared that the Arabs had blown up a railway bridge 70 miles north of the position the British troops were now holding. If this were correct, the railway communication ofthe Turkish army would be cut, and General Allenby&apos;s operations would be greatly assisted. General Wilson explained the position on the map, and pointed out that, if the retreat of the Turkish army to Damascus was cut off it would be possible for General Allenby to capture the bulk of the enemy forces opposed to him, which con-sisted of from 13,000 to 15,000 Turks, and about 2,500 to 3,000Germans.The attention of the War Cabinet was again called to the workwhich Colonel Lawrence was doing with the Arab forces, andGeneral Wilson undertook to make enquiries with regard to suitable recognition being given to Colonel Lawrence forhis valuable services.4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, accordingto reports received from Salonica up to 2 p.m. on 18th September,the cavalry had advanced some 40 kilom. If it was possible forthem to advance another 40 kilom. they would be able to cut themain railway line which fed the whole country, and this wouldprobably mean a general retirement. The British forces had attacked on either side of Lake Doiran, but had not made any considerable progress.The Italian Front. 5. Questioned as to&apos; whether there was any possibility of an offensive on the Italian front, the Chief of the Imperial General Staffreplied in the negative. General Wilson also pointed out that it was now too late for operations on the front owing to the shortness ofdaylight, snow, and other climatic conditions, and that Lord Cavanhad always been opposed to any offensive in Italy starting after the15th of this month.Press Reports on 6. The attention of the War Cabinet was called to the fact thatthe donags of so mtich. credit was continuously being given in the newspapers toColonial Troops.       t^e doings of Colonial troops on the Western front, and so little in comparison to what had been done by units belonging to the british army.Lord Curzon suggested that a telegram should be sent to Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Flaig, informing him that the War Cabinet wasimpressed by the undue prominence given in allocation of praise tothe Dominion troops, mentioning, at the same time, that there wasno trace of such undue prominence in his reports.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he was pro-ceeding to France shortly, and suggested that perhaps it would bebetter if he brought this matter to the notice of Sir Douglas Haigwhen he saw him.It was pointed out that the war correspondents for the Britishnewspapers reported the doings of the Colonial troops, in addition
Control of Allied 7. With reference to War&apos; Cabinet 473, Minute 4, regardingOperations in the attempts which were being made by the Allies in Siberia toSiberia. raise Russian levies, Mr. Balfour said that our relations with theUnited States Government in this matter were far from satisfactory.In fact, the whole question of the lack of cohesion amongst theAllies in the direction of executive action in Siberia was to him a source, of great anxiety. He constantly received telegrams fromGeneral Knox urging that certain action was absolutely necessary,and he (Mr. Balfour) found himself in the position of being unableto assist General Knox in any degree, as approval to any proposal made by our representative in Siberia had to be obtained from our allies before action could be taken. If he (Mr. Balfour) telegraphedto Washington supporting a proposal put forward by General Knoxhe knew that this would have the very opposite effect from what was desired. This position of affairs was of extreme gravity, and was liable to paralyse him diplomatically. Then, again, to add to thedifficulties of the situation, the Soviets were all at sixes and sevens.The only sign of unity was the fact that the Japanese were in command. As time went on, unless something was done to remedy the necessity of having to consult five different Powers before any action could be taken in Siberia, matters would get worse. Inaddition, he had to cope with the supposition of the United StatesGovernment that we were endeavouring to push them into an enterprise of which they were suspicious. Mr. Balfour thoughtthat, in order to co-ordinate Allied action, something was requiredsimilar to the Versailles Council, only differently constituted,to sit at Washington. One of his reasons for suggestingthis was that, whenever President Wilson sent over anyonefrom the United States to represent him on an affair of&apos; international importance, should that person take a view which supported one of the Allies and not the Presidentin any particular matter that might arise, the President immediatelythought his emissary had been &quot;got at&quot; by the Ally concerned.There was no way of remedying this except by the Council whichhe had suggested. The Versailles Council consisted of a permanentbody of soldiers, occasionally supplemented by a transitory body ofbig officials, such as Prime Ministers. Mr. Balfour did not proposethat the Council at Washington should be constituted on these lines,but should probably be a body, composed of soldiers and civilians,able to take decisions and give orders. The members would, ofcourse, have the right to appeal to their parent Governments, andwe shotdd be in constant communication with our own representatives,but he thought that, in the main, the Council would be able to act[1365-475] B 2to the special reports of the Colonial correspondents, and it was con-sidered that it was largely owing to this fact that more prominentnotice was given to the doings of the Colonial troops. The opinion was expressed that the Minister of Information had already realisedthis, having lately adverted to the fact that the numbers of menenlisted and the numbers of casualties in the British Armies wereproportionately in excess of those of all the Colonies.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should, on his nextvisit to France, bring this matter to the notice of theField-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief.(b.) The Secretary should interview Lord Beaverbrook, and bring to his notice the opinion of the War Cabinet onthis matter, and request him to take such steps as he considered necessary, so that the doings of the Britishtroops should receive equal recognition, in the press withthose of the Colonials.
collectively and quickly. As regards the place of meeting,Mr. Balfour had suggested Washington, but lie thought the Japanesemight object to this on the grounds that they were providing theCommander-in-Chief and the troops, and that Tokyo would be nearer to the scene of operations. On the other hand, Washington was morecentral and more accessible from an Allied point of view.At a later stage in the discussion the desirability of Vladivostockas the place of meeting was discussed, and there was a generalagreement that, if possible, this would be the best selection.Mr. Balfour undertook to draft a telegram on this subject for circulation to the members of the War Cabinet for their consideration.Mr. Bonar Law then raised the question of the decision arrivedat by the Cabinet&quot; on the previous Tuesday (War Cabinet 473,Minute 4) with regard to General Knox&apos;s request to raise 3,000Russians with the assistance of General Dietrichs. The decision, asset down in the Minutes, represented the agreement arrived at bythe War Cabinet, but he understood that Mr. Balfour and the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff had met after the Cabinet Meeting andwere not entirely in accord with the decision as recorded.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, when he sawMr. Balfour on Tuesday afternoon, they drafted a telegram which hadbeen sent off to General Knox. This telegram did not givepermission to General Knox to raise the 3,000 men, but told him that he should help in every possible way, as far as our material was concerned, to raise these men.Mr. Balfour said that he was rather nervous of our givingpermission to General Knox to raise these men without firstconsulting the French and United States Governments.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff intimated that if itwould help the Foreign Secretary in his negotiations with theFrench the War Office would be willing to waive any pretensionsthey might have that General Knox should ultimately exercise control over the forces raised. Rather than quarrel with theFrench, he was quite prepared for General Knox to serve underthe French nominee, General Paris.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) Before authorising General Knox to proceed with the raising of the 3,000 Russians, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should telegraph to the French and united States Governments, informing them of the steps we proposed to take, adding that, in view of theextreme urgency of the matter, if they had any objectionswe should be glad to know of them speedily.(fe.) The foregoing decision should govern Minute 4 of WarCabinet 473.8. With reference to War Cabinet 472, Minute 9, attention was drawn to telegrams Nos. 3281 and 3283 from Sir M. Findlay,containing reports by the Netherlands Minister at Petrograd on thesituation in Russia as affecting in particular British subjects andBritish interests under the Netherlands MinisteFs protection.It wras pointed out that two questions arose which demandedan early reply : (i.) Whether it was possible for the British Government to do anything in order to secure the early release, of british officials and others now imprisoned.(ii.) If it were diplomatically feasible, would it be possible to.publish a portion of telegram No. 3281, which dealt sofully with the horrible condition of the prisoners, sayingthat the information came from - a trustworthy and independent source ?
preparation for . 9. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to a note fromActs of Devastation the French Embassy (Paper G.T.-5724) calling attention to the actsCommitted by of devastation committed by the German troops during their presentG-erman Troops in     vvithdrawal on French territory, and asking for the views of Hisrance&quot; Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to the proposal to secure a solemndeclaration on the part of the Allies, having as its object the punishment of and reparation for these crimes.It was generally agreed that the British GoYernment wouldexpress the warmest sympathy with the French Government in theproposals put forward, but at the same time it would be desirablethat suggestions as to actual method should be more precise.In the absence of the Prime Minister the War Cabinet deferredfurther discussion of this subject.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs expressed the opinionthat some care was necessary before any action was taken, as the author of the report would otherwise be compromised. The shockand agony to relatives of those imprisoned must also be taken intoconsideration, and he agreed with the suggestion that it was possiblethat the author of the report was not a little hysterical in what hewrote, judging from some of the statements which he made.Lord Curzon asked whether something could not be done to save the prisoners, either by invoking international action or bymeans of a counter-threat. He pointed out that some three weekshad now elapsed since the death of Captain Cromie, and a week ormore since the release of M. Litvinoff, and suggested that M. Litvinoffshould be interviewed and informed that the British Governmentcould not allow the present state of affairs to go on, and that if theBritish officials were not released within a certain fixed time itwould be necessary to reincarcerate him.Mr. Balfour read a wireless telegram which he had that momentreceived. The telegram was from M. Chicherin, and was to theeffect that the Russian Government was still ready to grantpermission to the British officials to return via Finland at themoment when a message was received that M. Litvinoff was onboard a steamer and leaving England. The telegram proceeded to lay down certain conditions which Mr. Balfour characterised as&quot; very insolent,&quot; but said that, at the same time, he would beprepared to accept many conditions so long as it was possible to procure the escape of our own people, who undoubtedly were beingslowly killed. Questioned as to whether he considered it advisable for this telegram to be shown to Litvinoff, Mr. Balfour said that hewas of opinion that Mr. Leeper should see M. Litvinoff and discussthe telegram with him. Mr. Balfour at the same time pointed outthat, if M. Chicherin would promise to send the British subjectsacross the border, we should retain our hold on M. Litvinoff even after he had sailed, as it would be some days before he got toBergen.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should draft astatement, based on telegram No. 3281 from Sir M. Findlay,on the situation in Russia as affecting British subjects, forthe consideration of the War Cabinet as to the desirabilityof its publication.
Reported 10. With reference to War Cabinet 223, Minute 2, and War-Conference at Cabinet 233, Minute 9, Mr. Barnes called attention to a statementrne&quot; which had been made at the Labour Conference last year, to theeffect that a conference of financiers had been held in Switzerland.At that time a statement was issued by the Government saying-there was no foundation, in fact, for this report. &quot; The NewStatesman &quot; had now, in its last week&apos;s edition, said that a Confer-ence was held in Geneva last autumn, and had mentioned the names of three persons present, including that of Mr. Bell, amember of LloycVs Bank, and Mr. Furstenburg, who was intimatelyconnected with herr Scheidemann.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook to make enquiries into this matter and to inform Mr. Barnes.Threatened ^ 11. With  reference  to   War   Cabinet  474,  Minute   1, theRailway Strike. Chancellor of the Exchequer made a statement to the War Cabineton the railway situation. Mr. Bonar Law said that, when the WarCabinet decided to authorise no larger rise in wages than os., bothMr. Barnes and the President of the Board of Trade were very firmin giving no indication of any possibility of the War Cabinet reced-ing from that decision. Mr. Bonar Law had interviewed Mr. J. H.Thomas on the previous clay, and he had found him very reasonable.On pointing out to Mr. Thomas that it was quite impossible to go beyond the 5s. agreed upon, for even if a further Is. were advancedit would mean the War Cabinet had been forced to reconsider their decision because of a vote of the men, Mr. Thomas did not press for any further advance, and it was arranged that Mr. bonar law on behalf of the Prime Minister should see the Executive.This meeting was held at 10, Downing Street, and Mr. Barnes,Sir A. Stanley, and Sir H. Walker were present. Mr. Bonar Lawstated and emphasised the reasons which made it impossible for theGovernment to go beyond the offer already made. Later on, theexecutives, reversing the previous decision for a strike, which hadbeen carried by a majority of two, decided on settlement on the WarCabineFs terms by a majority of 37 against 26. The only branchwhich had not accepted these terms was the Association of Loco-motive Engineers and Firemen, but Mr. Bonar Law expressed theopinion that this Association would similarly agree. Mr. Bonar Lawsaid he regretted that the press had not given sufficient prominenceto the firm attitude adopted by the Government. ,Mr. Barnes pointed out that this could be done now, and that perhaps it would have been inadvisable to make too much of thisbefore a settlement had been arrived at. He also testified to thevery fine way in which Cabinet decision had been supported in thenegotiations by Sir A. Stanley and the Railway Executive.Mr. Bonar Law desired to emphasise the great assistance which Mr. J. H. Thomas had rendered towards a settlement, and expressed the opinion that he had acted throughout in a reasonable and patriotic manner.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.,September 20, 1918.
