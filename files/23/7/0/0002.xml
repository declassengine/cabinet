2The Western Front. 1. The Director off Military Operations reported, that there wasno fresh news from the Western front.Mesopotamia. 2. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to a copy ofa telegram (No. 51.1.17, dated the 1st July, 1918) from the Com-mander-in-Chief, India, !o the General Officer Commanding,Mesopotamia, in which General Marshall was asked whether hecould arrange for a detachment from the motor column, now withGeneral Dnnsterville, to move to the relief of Abadeh, which, withits garrison of British officers and Indian regular troops, was reported from Teheran to be invested by Qushquis. He was asked,in that event, how long the expedition would take, and whether anyreplacement with General Dunsterville could be effected. general marshall had replied to the effect that he was unable to helpAbadeh. Even if petrol were available, which was not the case,none of his armoured cars were in a condition to travel thatdistance.It was pointed out that no confirmation of the serious state ofaffairs at Abadeh had been received by the Foreign Office fromTeheran. The Director of Military Operations said that, from amilitary point of view, the suggestion put forward by theCommander-in-Chief, India, was not practicable, because not onlywas the distance too great, but it would be unwise to divert part of: General Dunsterville&apos;s force.   There were, however, some 600 PersianCossacks now at Ispahan, who might be employed to go to therelief of Abadeh.   They were the only possible relieving force the War Cabinet decided that The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should tele-graph at once to Sir C. Marling, putting forward thesuggestion that the Persian Cossacks should be used forthe relief of Abadeh.Loss of Hospital 3.

Hewas proceeding outside the prescribed area, with full lights on,when, without any warning, an enemy submarine fired a torpedoand the ship sank in. ten minutes. The Commander of the sub-marine had said, in reply to the protest of the master of the ship,&quot; But you are carrying eight American flight officers.&quot; This wasnot true, but it was a fact that eight Canadian medical officers wereto have been on board, of whom one did not join the ship. Usually,in these cases, it had been the practice of the Germans to take the captain of the ship prisoner. On this occasion, however, the captain, after being on board the submarine, had been sent back tohis boat, which the Germans had deliberately tried to sink byramming. Gunfire from the submarine then took place, presumablydirected against the ship&apos;s other boats.- . The War Cabinet decided that The Admiralty should issue an authorised version of the story,to the press.Spanish Officers onHospital Ships.4.

TheBolshevik losses were not yet known. British and Japanese landingparties, to the number of 700, had patrolled the central portions ofthe town and isolated areas where the consulates are situated, andalso furnished guards for protecting the Allied munitions outside theareas occupied by the Czechs. Russian and American ships had sent landing parties later in the day. The Coalition SiberianGovernment had declared itself, and had met with the sympathy and support of the population.
