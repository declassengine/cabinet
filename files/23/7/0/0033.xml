The Western. 1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that, asFront, the result of yesterday&apos;s advance, the French had now reached apoint east of Noyon, which was only 4 or 5 kilometres from the lineheld by the Germans on the 21st March, while opposite St. Quentinthey were 15 kilometres from the original German line. The civilpopulation of St. Quentin was being evacuated.General Wilson stated that there was no further news of import-ance from&apos;our front, but-there were indications that the Germans wereevacuating the civil population between Lille and Douai, but therewas no indication that, the civil population were being evacuated from Lille. A good deal of burning was going on behind theGerman lines. General Wilson said that he had received a com-munication from Marshal Foch&apos;s headquarters giving great praise tothe British Army and Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig for the con-duct of the recent-successful operations.Trans-Caucasia.) 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the situa-tion at Baku seemed most obscure. Two ships had arrived atKrasnovodsk. the first giving information that Baku had fallen, andthe second that it had not fallen, owing to the arrival of five steamersfrom Petrovsk with 1 ::&apos;,000 Cossack reinforcements.3. Attention was called to the recent information- showing anincreased tendency of the Bolsheviks to support the Germans.Lord Robert Cecil thought that- it was -unlikely that theGerm axis, would be able to get any man-power out of Russia. TheBolsheviks had tried to enforce conscription several times arid had failed, and it seemed clear that the Russians did not wish to fightany more on either side. It was encouraging to note that theGermans had been imable to obtain men from Courland, Lithuania-,and Esthonia. He -thought, however, that the conscription of 5,000Russians by the. Local Government at Archangel might have -Viabad effect.- Lord Milner and the Chief of the Imperial General Staffagreed v:The War Cabinet decided that  ,The War Office should send a telegram to General Poole, statingthat His Majesty&apos;s Government regretted the enforcement of conscription upon Russians at Archangel, and that theForeign -Office should send a similar telegram to Mr.Lindley, in order that he might be informed of thisdecision.The Czecho-Slovak 4. Lord Robert Cecil expressed the fear that if it were trueForces. that the Czecho-Slovaks were now in control of the whole Trans-Siberian Railway, the Americans would be reluctant to allowJapanese forces to remain in Siberia, and would try to get the czecho-Slovaks out of Siberia for use elsewhere. It appeared fromone of the telegrams that Sir Charles Eliot thought of travellingthrough from Vladivostock to Omsk.Mr. Churchill expressed the view that we should under no circumstances allow the Allied control of the Trans-Siberian Railwayto be forfeited.5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported the receiptof a message from General Diaz regarding the situation on theItalian front. General Diaz had returned to Italy on the previous day.
Gas Coal1 for 7. The War Cabinet approved the recommendations of theLondon. President of the Board of Trade for the supply of gas coal toLondon throughout the coming winter (Paper  G.T.-5543), and authorised Sir Joseph Maclay to make the necessary shipping adjust-ments.The Coal Situation. 8. With reference to War Cabinet 468, Minute 13, the PrimeMinister stated that he had seen a prominent miners&apos; agent, whowas of opinion that it might be possible to increase the coal outputby 5 per cent., and who had suggested the desirability of meetingsbeing addressed by the President of the Board of Trade and theCoal Controller in the mining &apos; areas themselves rather than inLondon.Sir Guy Calthrop stated that the output for August showed areduction of If million tons on the output of the correspondingperiod in 1917, and was only 400,000 tons better than that of Jrdy1918.Mr. Churchill stated that he was proceeding with the prepara-tion of his Coal Budget for 1919 as fast as possible, and hoped tohave it ready in a week or ten days. He was advised that, in caseof fogs in winter, the stocks in certain areas were dangerously low.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To adjourn the discussion pending the result of further enquiries by the Coal Controller.(6.) To ask&apos; the Secretary of State for War to ascertain thenumber of coal-miners in the army classed as B 1.Food Imports into 9. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thethe United King- Food Controller (Paper G.T.-5612) relating to food imports into thedom for the Cereal    Urrited Kingdom for the cereal year 1918-19.Year 1918-19. Major  Astor, representing   the   Food  Controller,   who wasdetained at Derby, stated that the Ministry of Food had put in a request to the Allied Maritime Transport Council for the importationof 13&apos;5 million tons of food for the cereal year 1918-1919, but itwas realised that they might have to make a reduction on that figure on the ground of urgent military necessity. The FoodController was prepared, by taking 500,000 tons off feeding-stuffs, and 600,000 tons off cereals (if the reserves of the latter were reduced from thirteen to nine weeks&apos; consumption), and200,000 tons off oddments, to bring their total requirements downto 12,200,000 tons. The Allied Maritime Transport Council had informed the Food Council that provisionally, and pending the examination of other programmes, they proposed to provide tonnage for a total programme of 18&apos;5 million tons, of which the british share would be 10&quot;5 million tons.Lord Robert Cecil stated that these figures were based onthe fact that we might have a larger harvest this year than last, anduntil we knew what the harvest was going to be the Allied maritime transport Council did not feel justified in going beyond theminimum requirements of each country. The Council had receivedinstructions to bring over as many American troops as possible, andthis fact had weighed with them in their deliberations. It wouldbe regrettable if the War Cabinet rejected the finding of the submarines, 6. The   Deputy   First   Sea   Lord   reported  that  the   U.S.&quot; Chester&quot; had sighted an enemy submarine near the Lizard onthe 5th September. The &quot; Chester &quot; attempted to ram the sub-marine, but missed by 20 feet. The &quot; Chester&quot; passed right overthe submarine and dropped four depth charges, which possibly damaged the submarine.
Transport Council without any further consultation with their allies.The Prime Minister said that the United States had promised that, by February 1919, they would bring over American troops intheir own transports. If it were possible for us to live on our stocks to a greater extent than ever before up to the month of February,then our own ships would be freed from the American transportwork and would be able to make good the deficit. It might bepossible to live for one month on the 13&apos;5 standard, and import atthe 10 5 standard ; after that month the Allied Maritime transport council could again consider the whole question in the light of thefurther knowledge they would then have at their disposal.Mr. Prothero said that he wished to know if his requirementswdth regard to feeding-stuffs would be met. It was essential to let the farmers know if they could expect feeding-stuffs, otherwise theywould rush their cattle on to the market within the next month,which would consequently result in a shortage at a later period.Sir C. Fielding urged that, in the interest of the milk supply,it was essential to know what the feeding-stuff position would be, asmilk-feeding began at once.Sir Leo Money laid emphasis on the provisional character of thefigures of the Allied Maritime Transport Council. The Council hadnot decided either that the Allies should definitely import at therate of 18-5 million tons, or that we should have 10&apos;5 million tons.These figures were tentative and provisional, and it was clearly understood that they were subject to revision in a few weeks&apos; time,when harvest and other estimates were available.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) For the next month the Food Controller should ration thecountry at the 13*5 million standard, or such otherstandard as he thought fit, imports during that monthbeing arranged on the basis approved by the allied maritime Transport Council.(b.) The Food Controller should be authorised to diminish the cereal reserve during that period, so far as necessary, tosecure an import of feeding-stuffs.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,September 6, 1918.o
