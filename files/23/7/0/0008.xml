2AmericanReinforcements :Publication ofInformation inregard to Numbercarried in british ships.1. THE attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to a telegram(No. 1062 of 12th July) which had been received from Mr. Bayleyin New York, in which he asked that the number of american reinforcements that had been shipped to Europe in British shipsmight be published.Mr. Bonar Law undertook to arrange that a question should beasked in the House of Commons on this subject in order that theMinister of Shipping could give in reply the information desired byMr. Bayley.Western Front:German Attack.2. The C.I.G.S. stated that the Germans had attacked thismorning at 4 a.m. on a front of between 80 to 90 kilometres.Chateau-Thierry was on the extreme right of the attack, and theGerman left reached practically the edge of the Argozme. So faras the information received up to the present went, it appeared thatthe town of Rheims had not been attacked, possibly because theenemy hoped to mano3uvre the French out of it. The C.I.G.S. saidthat little information had been received as to how far the germans had advanced, but at certain points they had penetrated to a depth of 2 kilometres. He understood, however, that General Foch was prepared to evacuate to a depth of 2 kilometres along the whole lineof the present attack without fighting in order to get out of the range of the German trench-mortars.With regard to the reserves, the C.I.G.S. stated that PrinceRupprecht had 40 fresh divisions, and 42 divisions which he couldwork by roulement. The Crown Prince had 24 fresh divisions, and2b which he could work by roulement. On the rest of the front theGermans had 3 fresh divisions, and 12 which they could use forroulement. This gave the Germans a total of 67 fresh divisions, and79 divisions which they could use for roulement on the whole front.On the front of the present attack the Germans had 15 divisions in line, excluding 1 or 2 divisions that were facing Rheims, which,up to the present, had not moved.To meet the above the C.I.G.S. stated that the French had in line on the battle front 16 or 17 divisions ; within call they had3&apos;) divisions, of which number, however, 4 were tired, and perhapsshould not be counted. This left them with 26 fresh divisions, ofwhich 5 were American. It was suggested that the 5 american divisions were equal in strength to about 10 French divisions. TheC.I.G.S. said, however, that he was not certain whether the guns ofthe American divisions were up to strength.Referring to the enemy&apos;s intentions, the C.I.G.S. said that it wasnot yet certain whether the present attack was the enemy&apos;s mainblow or not. If Prince Rupprecht&apos;s reserves were moved into the battle, it was fairly certain that the enemy meant to concentrate his efforts in this sector. Should, however, Prince Rupprecht&apos;s reservesnot be used, it was probable that the present attack would die out ina few days.The C.I.G.S. stated that the present battle was taking place onthe front anticipated by General Foch.&quot;Destruction of 3. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that the naval attache atJapanese Tokio  reported  that the   Japanese  battleship &quot; Kawachi &quot; wasBattleship. destroyed by an internal explosion on the 12th July, about 600 livesbeinglost.   This battleship was a dreadnought, completed in .1912,and armed with 12-inch guns. *The Air Situation.4. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that the Royal Air Forcedropped 7 tons of bombs on Zeebrugge, Ostend, and Bruges on the night of the 13th and 14th July. Fires were caused at La Brugeoiseworks. On the morning of the 14th July bombs were also dropped on Zeebrugge mole and lock gates.   Our machines were attacked
by six of the enemy, of which two were shot down, one crashed intothe sea, and two more were driven down out of control. All our machines returned safely.Vladivostock: 5, The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that a report had beenH.M.S. &quot;Suffolk.&quot; received from H.M..S. &quot;Suffolk&quot; saying that in order to free the czech troops at Vladivostock urgently required for a further advance,all the Allied ships had taken over guarding the separate districts.The Czech troops were still guarding outlying districts and outlyingAllied stores. A combined patrol had been instituted to demonstrateunited action by all the Allies present, including the Czechs.The telegram added that guard boats from the Allied ships werepatrolling the harbour entrance, but that they were inadequate forthe purpose, and it was asked that destroyers should be sent as soonas possible from Japan.Exchange of 6. With reference to War Cabinet 442, Minute 13, the ChancellorPrisoners of War. of the Exchequer informed the War Cabinet that the delegates had reached an agreement on the subject of the Exchange of Prisonersof War. The agreement of course was subject to ratification by theGovernments concerned.Naval Prize Bill. 7. With reference to War Cabinet 398, Minute 17, the War.Cabinet had under consideration a draft of a Bill to amend the law relating to Naval Prize of War (G.T.-4312).The War Cabinet approved of the Bill as drafted and amended.Publication of details of BritishEffort in France.8. The Prime Minister called the attention of the War Cabinetto an article which had appeared in the press written byMr. Arnold Bennett, which suggested that British infantry inFrance only numbered 350,000, and that it would be advisable ifthe British Government followed the example set by the AmericanGovernment and made known the number and full effort which hadbeen put forward by Great Britain during the war. Mr. Lloyd Georgeconsidered that to publish figures as regards infantry alone would only be misleading, and also said that he did not think it would be advisable to provide the German Intelligence Department with information as to the total number of our troops in France.The Secretary of State for War agreed with the Prime minister that it was most inadvisable that such figures should be published.Lord Milner pointed out that the War Office had received a document which had been written by Colonel Roure, which showed that the French had failed to appreciate the great effort which great Britain had put forward, and had not taken into considerationall that had been done by this country to assist the Allies in shipping,coal, clothing, munitions, &amp;c. Lord Milner also urged that no statement should be made which dealt only with rifle strength, asrifle strength entirely misrepresented the size of the fighting forces.The rifle strength of our army in Franee was less than a third of thetotal army, and less than one half of the combatant strength. Inspeaking of rifle strength, Lord Milner expressed the opinion that itwas essential to add the number of personnel employed with machine-guns, tanks, artillery, trench mortars, Lewis guns, &amp;c.Mr. Ohamberlain said that we are also largely responsible for supplying (e.g. clothing) the American troops, and that we were making large contributions of materials of all kinds to our Allies.To do this our export trade had been sacrificed and our shippingdiverted from its ordinary trade. Meanwhile the Americans and japanese were taking advantage of our pre-occupation with the war
to start new lines on these trade routes. The Shipping Controllerdesired to ask for a War Cabinet decision on the subject at theearliest possible moment. The matter was only delayed by theabsence of Lord Robert Cecil in France. It would be considered bythe Economic Defence and Development Committee.The War Cabinet decided That the Secretary should ask the Minister of National service to supply them with a statement of our total war effort interms of man-power.9. The Minister of Munitions drew the attention of the WarCabinet to a protest which had been received from the GermanGovernment against the use of certain classes of bullets by theBritish Army. Mr. Churchill explained that about a year and a halfago a Committee of the Ministry of Munitions met to examine thequestion as to whether any economy could be made in the use ofmetals in the manufacture of bullets. As a result, it was decided to substitute paper for aluminium in the core of the bullet, and bulletsin this way&apos; had been in use for about a year. The Germans had now challenged the using of such bullets, and some very strikingcorrespondence had been captured, which gave fully the variousreports made by regimental, brigade, divisional, and Army Head-quarters. Mr. Churchill read extracts from this correspondence,and pointed out that the General Officer commanding the VlthGerman Army had ruled that as the bullets presented outside acomplete envelope, it was not possible to fasten on to individualsoldiers blame for their use. The German Government, however,had entered a protest and said that these bullets inflicted woundssimilar to dum-dum bullets, and were in contravention of article 23,paragraph 1 (c), of the Declaration of The Hague Convention of 1899.Mr. Churchill said that these bullets were examined very carefullyby the Master-General of the Ordnance and other responsibleofficials, who are all confident that they do not violate The hague convention in letter or in spirit, that they do not break up onstriking, and that they do not inflict wounds more serious than anyother high velocity bullet. The paper was a feature by itself : ithad been examined and no bad germs had ever been found,but at the same time it would be easy to say that some foreignmatter might be able to get into a wound if the envelope broke. Thepaste used to fasten the paper is anti septically. treated.In reply7 to a question as to whether it was possible to revert tothe old pattern type, Mr. Churchill said that there was really nochoice, as the whole army was armed with this type of bullet now,and it would not only weaken our case if we changed the bullets,but apart from the difficulty which must necessarily be experienced,the moral effect of our own troops, who might think they had beenarmed Avith a bullet which would render them liable to reprisals onthe part of the Germans, would be very serious. Mr. Churchill saidthat a War Office Committee had drawn up an answer to the Germanprotest, which dealt at length with the details of: the manufacture ofthe bullet and with the reasons why it was not considered necessaryto discontinue its use. This answer, Mr. Churchill considered, was too long, and he suggested that a short reply.should be sent, without going into any details, categorically refusing to change the bullet,and saying at the same time that the British Government wasacting fully in accordance with the paragraph of The hague convention, mentioned above. It was proposed also in the reply tosay that if the German Government proceeded to take reprisals, theBritish Government would be forced to make use of counter-reprisals.After a short discussion, in which it was suggested that theGerman Government should be informed of the particular care
which, was being taken that the paper should be sterilised, the WarCabinet decided that A reply should be sent in answer to the German protest to theeffect that the British Government categorically refused to change the bullet now in use, giving as the reason That the bullet presented a complete outside enve-lope, and was strictly in accordance with article 23,paragraph 1 (c), of the Declaration of The hague convention of 1899.The answer should also state that if the German Governmentused reprisals as a threat because of the continued use ofthis bullet, the British Government would be forced tomake use of counter-reprisals-Oath of Allegiance 10. The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew the attention of the for Civil Servants. War Cabinet to a question which was being asked in the House ofCommons by Sir Henry Craik as to whether the Government wouldreqiiire anyone entering the Civil Service to take an oath of allegiancebefore doing so. It was generally agreed that this step should betaken by the Government, and it was also pointed out that it wouldbe advisable if all civil servants on entering should be called uponto express their willingness to serve in the armed forces of theCrown if called upon to do so, cases having occurred when men inGovernment employment and even men employed at the War Officeand Admiralty had pleaded conscientious objection on being calledupon.The War Cabinet decided that The answer to Sir Henry Craik&apos;s question should be in the affirmative.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 15, 1918.
