The Director of Military Operations reported the success ofa minor operation earned out by British and Australian troops southof the Somme. Important ground had been taken, to a depth ofabout 1,500 yards, as well as 1,000 prisoners. General Radcliffeadded that from the success of this operation useful informationmight be obtained as to where the next German offensive was likelyto take place. General Radcliffe continued by informing the WarCabinet that the French had successfully carried out two localoperations to the west of Soissons, and had also captured about1,000 prisoners.German Reserves.2. The Director of Military Operations informed the WarCabinet that Prince Rupprecht&apos;s reserves had now nearly reached their maximum, inasmuch as 40 out of 44 divisions were nowfresh and available for an attack. General Radcliffe added that within the next ten days a considerable number of the Crown Prince&apos;reserves would also, have had time enough to refit. It would be441] B
possible for Prince Rupprecht to attack on a front of about 50 miles,in addition to a subsidiary attack on a front of 12 miles.This meant that the number of German divisions available, and theextent of front on which an attack could be made, would be greater in ten days&apos;time than on the 21st March last. Questioned as to.the reasons for the delay in the Germans&apos; offensive, GeneralRadclitfe expressed the view that it might be their desire to make their next attack their maximum effort, but he considered thattime was invaluable to us, as each week that elapsed without the offensive taking place made our relative position stronger. he added that it also resulted in a great improvement in the Frenchmoral.american divisions inFrance.3. The Director of Military OperationA states that there were12 American divisions fighting under the French, either in the lineor in reserve, the strength of a division being about 12,000 infantry,but that onlv 7 were complete with artillery. There were 5 american divisions behind the British front, but none of them were at presentin the line, though 3 were available to hold rear lines of defence.Persia. 4. With reference to War Cabinet 439, Minute 2, the Directorof Military Operations stated that the War Office had received nonews as regards Abadeh. Attention was drawn to telegram No. 595,dated the 2nd July, 1918, from Sir C. Marling, to the Foreign Office,which indicated that the Cossack division at Ispahan was not sufficiently strong to send a force to the relief of the British party atAbadeh.Lord Curzon drew the attention of the War Cabinet to the factthat neither Sir C. Marling nor General Sykes bad brought to thenotice of the War Cabinet the possibility of difficulties arising inSouth Persia from a military point of view, or that the situation there was likely at any time to become suddenly serious, such as itappeared at the present moment.As regards Northern Persia, the Director of Military Operationsinformed the War Cabinet that a small body of Turks was movingfrom Suleimanie towards Sihna, and that there was every likelihood of an engagement taking place between them and the British detach-ment which was moving northwards from Kermanshah on the sameplace.East Africa. 5. The Deputy First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet thatthe British garrison of King&apos;s African Rifles, landed for the defenceof Kilimane, had advanced with the Portuguese to Mbamacurra, andbad been cut off by the enemy, the Portuguese having run. he added that the Commanding Officer of H.M.S. &quot; Talbot&quot; wasarranging to send, by H.M.S. &quot; Rinaldo,&quot; Royal Marines and machine-guns to Kilimane, for the defence of that place.Exchange of 6- The War Cabinet drew the attention of the Deputy First SeaPrisoners of War. Lord to telegram No. 1582, dated the 3rd July, 1918, from theAdmiralty to Lord Newton, asking that, in view of the torpedoingof the &quot; Koningin Regentes&quot; and the &quot;Llandovery Castle,&quot; theGerman delegates should be asked what form of guarantee they proposed to give that any safe-conduct for ships engaged in there patriation of prisoners of war would be adhered to, and indicating that, unless a satisfactory answer was given to this question, theAdmiralty considered it impossible to proceed further with negotia-tions on this subject.
Spanish Officers 7. With reference to War Cabinet 439, Minute 4, relative toon Hospital Ships, placing Spanish officers on board hospital ships in the Atlantic, the deputy First Sea Lord said that the matter bad been gone into bythe Admiralty. It was proposed to send Canadian invalids acrossto Canada in vessels under convoy, and a proposal had been madeto the War Office that Australian and New Zealand wounded shouldbe sent by rail to Marseilles and thence to Egypt in hospital ships,where they would be transferred to other vessels for conveyance tothe antipodes. If the War Office were unable to concur in this latter procedure, it would be necessary for the wounded to proceed by all-sea route by hospital ship. As far as the placing of Spanishofficers in hospital ships employed in the Atlantic was concerned,there was no objection on our part, but, as the American patientswould sail from French ports, the French and American governments were affected, and the Foreign Office had consequently been approached with a view to obtaining the concurrence of those&apos; Governments.Hospital Ships: 8. The question was raised as to whether it would be possibleReprisals. to carry out reprisals for such action as the sinking of hospital ships by the Germans, and the results of previous enquiries in this direc-tion were briefly related. The question was also raised as to whetherit would not be possible to devise some form of economic threat as areprisal for acts of this nature, although it was admitted that themain economic offensive as a whole must be reserved for much biggerquestions. It was mentioned that the subject of an economic offensive had been considered by the Committee appointed for thatpurpose.Mr. Chamberlain undertook to look up the question and toprepare a note for the consideration of the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet requested Lord Robert Cecil to ascertain what action had been taken bythe French with regard to placing German prisoners onboard their hospital ships in the Mediterranean, and what had been the results of such action.Spitzbergen. 9. with reference to War Cabinet 365, Minute if, the WarCabinet had under consideration Paper G.T.-4997, from the ForeignOffice, relative to Spitzbergen, in which it was pointed out that theAdmiralty remained of opinion that Spitzbergen possessed nostrategic importance to this country, and that, in the event ofGermany seeking to obtain a dominating position on the commission by the admission of a representative, a. claim by the French andBritish Governments for representation would be favourably regarded by Norway and Sweden, and that the attitude of the United states was doubtful, although it seemed very unlikely that they wouldAdmiral Hope explained that, unless some satisfactoryguarantee was forthcoming, the Dutch refused to allow theirhospital ships to be used for the conveyance of prisoners.As it was not clear whether this telegram had been sent by theAdmiralty after consultation with the Prisoners of War Department,the War Cabinet requested Lord Robert Cecil to look into the matter, with a view tosuspending any action which would prevent an agreement being arrived at on the matter of exchange, the questionof guarantee-as to the transport of prisoners being treatedas a matter for further consideration.
oppose such a claim. It was further stated in the memorandum that no other countries except Russia have any particular interest inSpitzbergen.The War Cabinet decided that  It was very desirable that Great Britain&apos; should be represented on the Spitzbergen Commission,And authorised The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to take the necessary action in due course.Holland:Despatch of convoy to dutch east Indies.AnniversaryService onAugust 4:Special Service ofIntercession at st.. MargarefsChurch.Coke-oven andBy-ProductWorkers:Payment forWeek-end Work.10. With reference to War Cabinet 432, Minute 7, the WarCabinet had under consideration telegram No. 2401, of the 2nd July,1918 ; telegrams Nos. 2406, 2409, and 2412, of the 3rd July, fromthe British Minister at The Hague, and telegrams Nos. 1383 and1506 from the Foreign Office to the British Minister at that place.Lord Robert Cecil stated that the Dutch had now met us except as regards M. Kruss and a certain wireless installation which therewas some ground for believing was partly of German manufacture.As regards M. Kruss, although he might be dangerous from thepoint of view of stirring up sedition inTndia, it must be realised thatif he was a man of that character he would be even more dangerous to the Dutch themselves, and Lord Robert Cecil said that he wasnot disposed, therefore, to hold up the convoy as regards the passageof this individual. He held a similar view as regards holding it upfor having on board two sets of low-powered wireless installation exDutch torpedo-boats. He recommended that Admiral Hope and himself should discuss the matter, and be authorised to act as theymight consider necessary as regards the sailing of the convoy.Admiral Hope pointed out that it was very important that, ifthe convoy was allowed to sail, the Dutch should not treat anyleniency which we might show in the matter as a precedent for the shipment, at a later date, of further supplies of wireless, &amp;c, andthat it should be made clear that, if we acceded to their representa-tions in this case, it was only a special privilege as regards thisparticular convoy.The War Cabinet decided that -It was undesirable to stop the sailing of the Dutch convoy onminor points, and approved the proposal of Lord robert cecil.11. With reference to War Cabinet 439, Minute 7, the ActingSecretary drew the attention of the War Cabinet to a letter whichhe hud received from the Speaker of the House of Commons, asking that he might have the authority of the War Cabinet to make thenecessary arrangements with the Lord Chancellor, the archbishop of Canterbury and the rector of St. Margaret&apos;s for the special service of Intercession at that church on the 4th August.The War Cabinet instructed The Acting Secretary to inform the Speaker that they gratefullyaccepted his proposal.I 2. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Munitions dealing with an application by the NationalUnion of Coke-oven and By-Product Workers for a modification ofan award of the Committee on Production in respect of payment forweek-end work (Paper G.T.-5016).Sir Stephenson Kent explained that the National Union of coke-oven and By-Producf Workers were asking that an award ofthe Committee on Production should be modified in respect thatthe payment of time-and-;i-quarter for week-end work, prescribed in
othe award, should be increased to payment of time-and-a-half forwork done on Sunday. Before the war Sunday work was regarded as a part of a continuous process, and there was noextra pay, seven days&apos; work being covered by the pay. TheExecutive Council of the Union had resolved to instruct its members to cease Saturday and Sunday work if the claim were not conceded.Such a, cessation of work would mean a loss of 20 per cent, in theoutput of steel, and 40 per cent, in the output of light oil a losswhich the Ministry of Munitions could not possibly afford. In someovens there had already been a stoppage of Sunday work. Therehad been heavy recruiting from this industry, and, as a result, menwere being asked to work a good deal of extra time. The men whowere left in the industry realised that they were in a strong bargaining position.Sir Thomas Munro said the men were putting forward a claim for extra pay not only for Sunday work but for overtime, but hethought they would give in on the latter point. With regard toSunday work, the principle of extra- pay had in fact been concededby the decision of a special tribunal, which granted time-and-a-quarter, in reference to the blast furnace industry; this hadbeen followed by the Committee on Production in their awardapplying to the coke-oven industry. The extension to time-and-a-half did not, therefore, involve a new principle. Hewas bound to point out that, if the claim of the union were now conceded, it would have wide ramifications and would almost certainly have to be extended to other trades in whichcontinuous processes were necessarily worked, such as blast furnacesand branches of the chemical trade. A demand might even be madefor its extension to the surface workers of the mines, which might prove very costly. He had met the employers that morning, and,while they were unwilling.to make the concession themselves, they recognised rhat the Government had no alternative but to admit theclaims of the Union.Sir David Shackleton concurred in the views set forth on behalfof the Minister of Munitions, but pointed out that to make the concession would react very unfavourably on the position and authority of the Committee on Production. The award grantingtime-and-a-quarter for week-end work was made by a Special Courtof Arbitration after the Committee on Production had, in accordancewith the practice of the industry,- refused extra payment for week-endwork. The Secretary of the Committee had told him on theprevious day that the task of the Committee had been made almost impossible by the action of the Government in superseding theirawards, and by the action of employers in giving sectional advances to special classes of workmen.Sir Stephenson Kent agreed that the position of the Committeeon Production was being rendered very anomalous, and that workmenwere obtaining an advantage in a double way, from the awards ofthe Committee and from the sectional advances granted by theemployers. He was most anxious to carry the Committee on production in the present dispute on the ground that the decisionto grant the advance did not involve a deviation from principle.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To authorise the Minister of Munitions to concede thedemand made by the National Union of Coke-oven andBy-Product Workers for the payment of time-and-a-halffor work done on Sunday.(/;.) To ask Mr. Barnes to convey to the Committee on Pro-duction the reasons why the Cabinet bad come to theabove decision.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 4, 1918.
