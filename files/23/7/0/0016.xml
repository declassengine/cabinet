THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that the-^ront- fact that the Germans were unable to take up a stand on the RiverOurcq was very good from our point of view, and raised a doubt asto whether they would be able to stand on the Vesle, which latterstand, he thought, would be impracticable in any case unless theyfell back in the near future from the southward of Soissons.General Wrilson added that the Germans had held their lines stiffly,so as to clear away their material within the salient, and that[1365-453] &apos;   . B
probably by now they had effected their object in this direction.General Wilson stated that on this portion of the front 67 german divisions had been identified. Of these, 21 had been withdrawn,leaving 46 in line.Questioned as to that portion of the telegram from General DuCane, dated the 27th instant (No. 153), which stated that Tannieres,Ouiry Housse and Chacrise were burning, the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff stated that these places were just south of the Vesle,which indicated that that was the minimum retirement which theGermans proposed to make. General Wilson added that theGermans, up to the present, had retired according to plan and were fighting very well. He mentioned that there were no signs of anyattack from the German front held by Prince Rupprecht.British Offensive. 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that this morning we had attacked between the Ancre and the somme on a front of 4,000 yards, with the object of capturing somehigh ground in the vicinity. Latest advices indicated that we hadprogressed to a depth of 500 yards.Austrian Moral. 3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that reliable information had been received that the austrians were far more shaken by the Italian counter-offensives,more especially on the Asiago Plateau, than we had thought.Salonica. 4. In reply to a question as to whether General Milne had.been informed of the decisions that had been arrived at in Paris asregards an offensive in the Balkans, or otherwise : The Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook to ascertain whether General Milne had been kept fully informed ofthe policy of the Government in this connection, and totake any steps that might be necessary to this end.Submarines.5. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that therehad been a certain amount of anti-submarine activity round thecoast in the last two days, and there was a possibility of two attackshaving been successful, one being effected by the trawler &quot; Calvia,&quot;in conjunction with the torpedo-boat destroyer &quot; Vanessa,&quot; in thevicinity of Scarborough, and the other by an aeroplane in thevicinity of Hartlepool, one of the bombs dropped apparently hittingthe conning-tower of the submarine, after which she suddenlydisappeared.Ireland:Irish Land (Provi-siou for sailors and Soldiers) Bill.6. The War Cabinet had under consideration a draft ofthe Irish Land (Provision for Sailors and Soldiers) Bill (paper g.T.-5099.)The Secretary of State for the Colonies, questioned as to how this proposed Bill would affect discharged soldiers in Ireland ascompared with discharged soldiers in Great Britain, said that therewas, to his knowledge, no legislation dealing with this question in.Great Britain, with the exception of the Small Holdings Act, but he understood that the Board of Agriculture had introduced a bill which made arrangements for land to be allotted to discharged and disabled soldiers and sailors. It was difficult to compare the Billunder discussion with any such measure, as the proposed Bill waswas only intended to remove certain small disabilities which now
3- WG 453existed owing to the effect of the Irish &apos; Land Acts. The objectof those Acts was to secure the termination of uneconomicholdings, and they laid down that when land was acquired inIreland farms might be made economic by being consolidated,but it is a condition that the land must in the first instancebe given to the tenants or proprietors of small holdings.This Bill provided that the same power should be given withregard to returned sailors and soldiers as was given with regardto those who had not served in the war. Under the provisionsof the Bill no right was asked for to lease land. Questionedas to whether this Bill would apply only to men who had enlisted inIreland, Mr. Long said that it would also apply to Irishmen whohad enlisted in Great Britain, rhany thousands of such men havingclone so, and it was only right that they should have the sameprivileges.The Chief Secretary for Ireland stated that it might be necessaryto move certain, amendments in order to give allotments in urban areas, and that provision had already been made in regard to oneestate being held for the settlement of discharged sailors andsoldiers. With regard to Section 1, Sub-section 4, of the Bill,Mr. Shortt explained that under this sub-section land might be lettemporarily in order that a harvest might not be missed.The War Cabinet approved the draft Bill.Future of Home 7. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandum byRule. Mr. Barnes (Paper G.T.-5 1 99) and a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for the Colonies (Paper G.T.-5209) on the subject of thefuture Home Rule, and also considered the answer which was to begiven in the House of Commons that afternoon by the chief secretary for Ireland on the motion to be moved bv Mr. Dillon.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that, in conjunctionwith Lord French and the Chief Secretary for Ireland, he had had ameeting with the Prime Minister last Friday, at which it was arranged that in the debate which was to take place that afternoonthe Chief Secretary should follow Mr. Dillon, who was to move the motion. It had been agreed at this meeting that the policy as previously announced by the Government still stood, and that,consequently, conscription could not be introduced without a home rule Bill. Lord French had been in favour of the application ofthe Military Service Acts to Ireland, urging that these Acts could be easily applied at the present time, but it had been pointed out tohim that to do this without the introduction of a Home Rule bill was contrary to the policy of the Government.Mr. Barnes asked what the policy of the Government was to beon the 1st October in the case of the 50,000 recruits, asked for underthe voluntary scheme, not having been obtained, and said that he understood that there was a meeting of the Labour Party that afternoon at which Mr. Adamson and Mr. Henderson would be present, and at which it was to be proposed that the Labourand Irish Parties should adopt a joint policy in the House ofCommons in order to urge the adoption of Home Rule.Mr. Long said that, if municipal elections were held in Ireland,there was no doubt that at the present time the Sinn Feinerswould capture 90 per cent, of the seats outside Ulster, and he believed that they would clo the same in regard to Parliamentaryseats. So strong was the feeling in favour of Sinn Fein in Irelandthat he was informed that even Mr. Dillon would be beaten in county Mayo, which was considered to be one of the safestNationalist seats in Ireland.(At this stage of the proceedings the Prime Minister took the Chair.)
The Prime Minister said that it had been suggested to him,with regard to this question, that nothing should be done this session. When the House reassembled after the recess it wouldthen know the results of the scheme of voluntary recruiting inIreland, and a decision must be arrived at. It would also be confronted with the necessity of arriving at a decision as to whetherthe Military Service Acts should be enforced in Ireland withoutdealing at the same time with the question of Home Rule. Therehad been a great deal of discussion on the subject of the congestion of business in Parliament, and Mr. Lloyd George suggested that the interval occasioned by the recess should be utilised in setting up aCommittee which might be given the following terms ofreference : &quot;In the event of its being decided to establish subordinatelegislatures in different parts of the United Kingdom &quot; (i.) What   power  should   be   devolved   upon   theselegislatures ?&quot; (ii.) What   should   be    the    constitution    of   theselegislatures ?&quot; (iii.) What consequential changes would be required inthe composition of the Imperial Parliament? &quot;Mr. Llovd George said that these terms of reference might require slight amendment, but he considered it was necessary thatan authoritative body should be set up to inquire into the mannerin which this problem, could best be dealt with. It was certain that whatever line the Government took on Home Rule, the Irish wouldnot be satisfied, and therefore the problem must be faced and solvedbv the British Government.Lord Curzon said that he was opposed to anjr Federal solution,and asked whether it was proposed that the Committee to be set up should render a report on this very grave constitutionel change intwo months. The setting up of such a Committee would only givethe impression that the Government was inclined to accept a Federalsolution, and, for his part, he was not prepared to pull up theBritish Constitution by the roots in order to get Ireland out of herdifficulties.The opinion was expressed that a sudden announcement inParliament of such a decision would only increase the present diffi-culties of the situation; that it would be impossible for the present parliament to deal with the question of Federation; that it mightarouse strong antagonism from the Ulstermen ; and that it wouldnot help the situation which must undoubtedly arise at the begin-ning of next october the President of the Board of Education urged that the real question to be considered was what was to be the attitude of theGovernment next October. Assuming that the voluntary recruitingscheme had broken down, did the Government intend to carry out its declared policy, which was, that the Military Service Acts couldnot be enforced without the introduction of a Home Rule Bill?The Committee proposed by the Prime Minister would not help in solving the question.In answer to a suggestion that it might be possible to introduce a Home Rule Bill excluding the six counties, Mr. Long said that he considered that this was the worst settlement of all. Ulster was ina position to help herself, but his sympathies were with the Unionistsin the South of Ireland, who were unable to protect themselves, andthere were very few in Ireland who would now be found willing tosupport such a Bill. Even if the Home Rule Bill proposed by theCommittee over which he presided were brought forward, Mr. Long-considered that the Minister who had charge of that Bill would havean extremely difficult task.The Minister of Reconstruction, however, was inclined to thinkthat a Bill on the lines suggested by Mr. Long&apos;s Committee, even if
it gave special safeguards to the Southern Unionists, would make a beginning of self-government for Ireland, and urged that the dangerof 6inn Fein in Ireland would never be got rid of until some form ofsolf-government had been set up.Mr. Chamberlain, speaking- as a member of Mr. Long&apos;s Com-mittee, expressed the opinion that to bargain with Ulster onthe basis of excluding the six counties was to forfeit all support from the Southern Unionists, and to say that it was proposedto legislate exceptionally for Ireland was to lose all chance of securingUlster&apos;s consent. In no other way than by means of a federal scheme could Ulster&apos;s consent be obtained. In his opinion, the Billbrought forward by Mr. Long&apos;s Committee, though the best possible under the terms of their reference, was a bad compromise betweenFederation and Dominion Home Rule. It was framed on wrrouglines from beginning to end, and left the Central Government in anentirely wrong position.Mr. Bonar Law strongly expressed the opinion that, since theproposal of what might be termed the &quot; double policy,&quot; the whole position had changed. It bad been hoped that the Nationalistswould accept conscription, but not only had they not done so, butthey had made claims which had never been made before, and theirattitude justified the Unionists in saying that all they had predictedhad come true. For his own part, he could have nothing to do witha Bill which w-ould not only discredit Unionists, but in wdiich therewas no prospect of a settlement of this question.The Prime Minister said that he was not prepared to take theattitude that the Military Service Acts should not be applied toIreland. To do this would mean that the British Governmentsurrendered to the challenge of the Church on the question of the supremacy of the British Parliament. He did not agree that thequestions of the application of the Military Service Acts and theintroduction of a measure of Flome Rule stood together, and, insupport of his argument, quoted from the speech which he made inthe House of Commons on the 9th April, in which he had said that each of these questions would be considered on its merits. Thequestii m which the War Cabinet had to decide was, what answer theChief Secretary was to give to the motion to be moved by Mr. Dillon.In his opinion, the policy announced in April still stood. There couldbe no greater mistake than to introduce a Bill which both sideswould repudiate. That, however, was a question which could bedealt with at a later time. Mr. Lloyd George said that he made noapology for the fact that he had not even seen the Bill which hadbeen drafted by Mr. Long&apos;s Committee, as the whole of his time sincethe -list March had been taken up with the gigantic task of dealingwith the problem created by the German offensive on the western front.The War Cabinet deferred further discussion on this subjectto a later date.Indian Reforms :Formation of committees recom-mended in JointReport.8. The Secretary of State for India said that the War Cabinet,at their 438th Meeting (Minute 7), had had before them a paper byMr. Chamberlain (Paper G.T.-4956) which recommended that thepolicy of popularising local bodies should be formally approved, and,further, that two Committees should be at once set up: the first toexamine and report on the question of constituencies and franchise,and upon the composition of the Legislative Councils and LegislativeAssemblies, and the second to advise upon separation of functions and the division between reserved and transferred subjects. TheWar Cabinet had decided at the time to adjourn the discussion untilthe Prime Minister, who was on the point of starting for France,,could be present, and it had been suggested at the meeting that lord Curzon, Mr. Chamberlain, and Mr. Montagu should meet and. C
discuss Mr. ChamberlaiiPs suggestion, in the first instance. Thethree Ministers had accordingly met, and had agreed to recommendthat the two Indian Committees should be appointed forth-with, and an announcement made to that effect. Mr. Montaguexplained that the work of both Committees would beexploratory only, and that any recommendations they might make would in no way bind His Majesty&apos;s Government; their examination of the questions referred to them, and their own proposals, would, in fact, merely complete the investigations he had himself conducted during his recent visit to India. He strongly urged, the appointment of the two Committees, and further, thatGovernment sanction to their appointment, if accorded, should bemade public. In reply to a question, Mr. Montagu said that it was proposed that the nomination of the Chairmen of qhe committees should rest with His Majesty&apos;s Government, and that the members should be selected by the Government of India. In his view, itmight be desirable that the same Chairman should preside over the deliberations of both Committees.Lord Curzon said that he had approved of the two Committeesbeing set up, on the ground that the scheme, in itself, was not com-plete until a report had been received on the questions to be examined by these Committees. At the same time, he adhered tohis opinion that the Government should not commit itself in anyway, as the proposals were already meeting with considerable criticism, which would, in his opinion, increase in the future.The War Cabinet decided-To approve the appointment of the Committees, and the publi-cation of the fact that the appointment had received thesanction of His Majesty&apos;s Government.Passports to Indian ^- The Secretary of State for India said that at a recent meetingDelegates. &quot;* of the War Cabinet (War Cabinet 428, Minute 11) it had beenIndian Eeforms. decided that Mr. Tilak should be permitted to proceed to the UnitedMr. Tilak and Kingdom for the sole purpose of prosecutmg his libel action againstDr. Nair. g;r Valentine Chirol, provided that he gave an undertaking, both onbehalf of himself and of his solicitor, that- neither would indulge in propaganda ofanj-kind. On the 15th July, 1918, Lord Curzon had,at the Prime Ministers request, assembled a Committee to deal with questions arising out of the visits of Dr. Nair and Mr. Tilak to thiscountry. The Committee had been informed by Mr. Montagu thatthe latter had obtained from Dr. Nair the same undertaking inregard to making public speeches as had been given by Mr. Tilak.The Committee had decided (Paper G.T.-5144) that the restrictions imposed on Dr. Nair and Mr. Tilak as regards taking part in propaganda work should not be removed in either case. Mr. Montagusaid that, since that decision, the Maharaja of Patiala, Sir S. Sinha,and Mr. Basu had all made public speeches in this country in favourof the reforms advocated by the Viceroy and himself. Dr. Nair, whowas opposed to some of the proposals put forward in the Joint Report,was anxious to be allowed to state his views in public. In thecircumstances, Mr. Montagu felt bound to urge His. Majesty&apos;sGovernment to withdraw their embargo in the case of both Dr. Nairand Mr. Tilak, as he considered it was no longer possible to justifyand defend the&quot; Governments attitude, which would certainly beregarded, as a deliberate muzzling of Dr. Nair and other Indianciitics of the proposed reforms.Lord Curzon agreed .that the situation had entirely changed since the meeting of the 15th July, and that the decision then taken against Dr. Nair speaking in public should be rescinded. He didnot consider that it Was necessary for a decision about Mr. Tilak tobe taken that day, but expressed the Opinion that no analogy could
Members of the 10. The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew the attention of the privy Council of      War Cabinet to two questions which were being asked in the Housenemy   ngm. Qf Qommons that afternoon on the   subject   of  the position ofmembers of His Majesty&apos;s Privy Council who were of enemy origin,and of the position of Sir Edgar Speyer, who had, in 1915, askedto be relieved of his membership of the Privy Council, which requesthad, at that time, been refused.The War Cabinet decided that The Chancellor of the Exchequer should reply that, in theevent of the Nationality and Status of Aliens Bill becominglaw, the name of Sir Edgar Speyer would be submitted tothe Committee to be set up under that Bill.With regard to the general question, a reply should be givento the effect that the subject was to be raised in theHouse of Lords, and a decision by the Government wouldthen be taken.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 29, 1918.obe drawn between Dr. Nair and Mr. Tilak : Dr. Nair was a responsible and respectable gentleman, while Mr. Tilak had servedseven years imprisonment for making speeches causing bombs to be thrown. At the meeting on the 15th July Mr. Balfour, the Directorof Military Intelligence, the Secretary of State for Home Affairs, andLord Hardinge, had all agreed that it would be most dangerous toallow Mr. Tilak to indulge in propaganda in this country a view inwhich he (Lord Curzon) concurred.Mr. Chamberlain said there was great difference of opinionexpressed at the meeting referred to. Personally he had proposedthat both Dr. Nair and Mr. Tilak might be released from therestrictions imposed on them, the position having altered so muchnow that the report on Indian Reforms had been published. Itwould have been most undesirable to have had any agitation stirredup in this country by Mr. Tilak while Mr. Montagu was still inIndia.Owing to pressure   of  other   business,   the   discussion   was adjourned until Wednesday, the 31st instant.
