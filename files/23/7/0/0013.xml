Western Front. 1. The Director of Military Intelligence explained the situation by means of a map. He stated that the French advance sinceyesterday had been considerable and had been very satisfactory, andgood progress had been made from the east of Chateau-Thierryto the north of Ourcq. The Director of Military Intelligenceadded that the French held the opinion that the German retreatwould continue as far as to either the River Ardre or the RiverVesle.German Divisions 2. The Director of Military Intelligence then gave details as toemployed. tfcie number of German divisions which had been, employed in theGerman attacks. Seventeen divisions had been identified on thefront Chateau-Thierry-Vrigny, 16 had been identified east ofRheims, and 21 on the Soissons-Chateau-Thierry &apos;front, making atotal of 54.The Director of Military Intelligence said that at the beginningof the offensive on the 15th July the Crown Prince had 32 first-class fresh divisions, 29 of these being in reserve or on the battlefront, and 3 of them on a non-battle front. Of these 29 divisions26 had already been employed, which left the Crown Prince with only 3 or 4 first-class divisions. These figures included the reserves which had been brought down from Prince Rupprechtfsarmy.With reference to Prince Rupprecht&apos;s army, the Director ofMilitary Intelligence stated that Prince Rupprecht had 26 fresh divisions available for battle. Of these 26, 14 were first-classdivisions. He had also 8 divisions which had been heavily hammeredin trench warfare on our front. Of divisions actually in the linePrince Rupprecht possessed 37 available for roulement, he also had8 other divisions in the line, thus making a total of 79 infantry and2 cavalry divisions. Against this force we had on our side 49 british divisions, together with 3 second-class divisions and 3 cavalry divisions. We had, in addition, the 5 American divisions. Therewere also 6 Belgian divisions available. We had, therefore, 63divisions opposing Prince Rupprechtfs 79.German Man- 3. The Director of Military Intelligence said  he  had beeninaccurately reported as stating that the German youths of 17Jyears of age would be in the field this year. What he had said wasthat the German 1920 class, i.e., men born in 1900, whose averageage on the 1st July, 1918, was 18, might be used in the field thisyear. There were 400,000 of this class training in the depdts, butit was improbable that any number of them would appear on the battle front until October, and then only if absolutely necessary.Bombing Raid at 4. With reference to War Cabinet 449, Minute 7, the DeputyTondern. First Sea Lord reported that the bombing raid carried out on theair-ship sheds at Tondern on the 19th instant was carried out by7 machines from H.M.S. &quot;Furious.&quot; One large double shed was seen in flames, and a second shed was also hit. In addition amagazine 1 mile away exploded. One of our machines returnedbefore the attack owing to engine trouble, and 4 pilots were missing.A report had since been received that 8 of our pilots had landed in denmark and were interned.H.M.S. &quot;Marne.&quot; 5. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that H.M.S. &quot; Marne &quot;had destroyed &quot;.U.B. 124&quot; by gunfire on the 20th July, about 20 milesfrom Malin Head. The commanding officer and 31 prisoners hadbeen captured. Admiral Hope stated that this was probably one ofthe submarines which had torpedoed the &quot; Justicia.&quot;
United StatesCruiser&quot; San Diego.&quot;The suggestion was made that H.M.S. &quot; Marne&quot; havingdestroyed a &quot; U &quot; boat on Saturday last was singularly appropriate in view of the French victory, and the First Lord was asked if therewas any objection to the incident being published. The First Lordstated that there was no objection to publishing the name of the destroyer, provided the position and the date of the attack were kept secret.The War Cabinet requested The First Lord to carry out this suggestion.Submarines. 6.  The  Deputy   First   Sea   Lord   reported  that  steamship&quot; Justicia,&quot; 32,120 tons gross, was torpedoed 19 miles from Skerry-vore Lighthouse on the evening of the 19 th instant. Whilst beingtowed to port the &quot; Justicia &quot; was again torpedoed on the afternoon of the 20th instant and was sunk.The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that H.M.S. &quot; Garry,&quot; whilstescorting a convoy, twice rammed and then sank &quot; U.B. 110,&quot; on the19th instant, 11 miles from Hartlepool, 2 officers and 12 men,including the commander, had been rescued.7. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that the United StatescruiserYork.San Diego&quot; struck a mine and sank 50 miles east of NewRussia:allied intervention..8. The War Cabinet had before them two telegrams from lord reading (3296 and 3265 of the 19th July) regarding an aide-memoirewhich President Wilson had communicated to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment respecting Allied intervention in Russia. The PrimeMinister apologised to the Dominion Prime Ministers and theColonial Secretary for breaking up an Imperial Conference in orderthat they should attend the War Cabinet to give their views on this important subject. The Prime Minister added that his reason for doing this was that Lord Reading had asked for a reply to his telegram early to-day, as he was seeing President Wilson to-morrow.The Prime Minister said that it was difficult not to take exception to the tone ofthePresident&apos;sai(fe-?nemo&apos;Zre,and hewasinclined to believethat it was written in order that it might sooner or later be published.The Prime Minister said that he thought it was the duty of theGovernment to traverse the suggestion made by the President thatwe were endeavouring to set up a reactionary Government in Russia,and that President Wilson alone was protecting the liberty of theRussian people. Liberty meant that the Russian nation should havethe right of setting up any Government they chose. If they chose a republican Government, or a Bolshevist Government, or a MonarchicalGovernment, it was no concern of ours. Then there was thesuggestion made by the President that intervention in Siberia wouldbe a diversion of our effort on the Western front. The PrimeMinister said that the whole point of asking the Japanese to- intervene was that a force which could only be available in an Eastern theatre should be used there, and so not detract from theAllied efforts in the West.The Prime Minister then read to the War Cabinet a memorandum setting out the points which he thought should be emphasised in our reply to the Presidents aide-memoire. In answer to the first point,that the President attached so much importance to the western front that he was reluctant to withdraw any troops from that area for the purpose of operation in any other quarter, it should be statedthat the Allies never contemplated the despatch of large Americanor Allied forces to Siberia, and their proposal was, in order to savetroops capable of fighting on the Western front, that the bulk of
American Convoys. 9. In continuation of War Cabinet 447, Minute 4, and WarCabinet 449, Minute 13, the Shipping Controller stated that he fully realised the Admiralty responsibility as regards American troopconvoys, and the great success that had attended their efforts inthe past. The point that he was anxious to make in connection withthese convoys was that there should not be too much rigidity inthe number of ships carrying troops. What happened was, that troops had been discharged from certain vessels, which came on in whatever troops were necessary to the Siberian expedition should beprovided by Japan.With regard to President Wilson&apos;s impression that the BritishGovernment had ulterior designs in Russia in reference to the con-stitution of the country, it should be answered that we had not the slightest intention or desire to throw in our weight on the side ofany particular form of constitutional settlement in Russia, but thatwe were anxious for the Russian people to determine their ownconstitution in Russia without interference from anyone.The third point regarding the reconstituting of the western front should be replied to to the effect that the Allies had not contem-plated the probability of immediately restoring the military power ofRussia. All they hoped was that Russia would sufficiently recoverher strength to constitute a formidable menace to Germany in theEast, and thus absorb large German forces which would otherwise besent to the Western front. The Allies also contemplated that itwould be highly probable that the Germans, not being able to sparelarge numbers of men from the West to support their plans in theEast, might be driven to abandon those plans. If so, by this meansRussia would be liberated from the German yoke. The memorandumthen went on to state that the British Government welcomed thedecision of the United States Government to send a small military force to Vladivostock to co-operate with the other Allied forces.The memorandum concluded by saying that the British Govern-ment was not satisfied that a force of 20,000 men would be equal tothe rescue of the Czecho-Slovaks from Samara to Irkutsk, and thatfor this reason they deplored the decision to confine the military aid of the Japanese to a force of 7,000 men.The suggestion was made that, in answer to President Wilson&apos;saide-memoire, stress might be laid on the economic resources which germany would obtain from the East, and that these resources would give her the means and moral encouragement to continue thestruggle. While there was a general agreement that this was avery strong part of the case for Allied intervention in Russia, it waspointed out that this reply to the President was not intended to bea full survey of the whole case for Allied intervention, but rather an answer to the points which had been misrepresented in PresidentWilson&apos;s aide-memoire.A question was asked whether it was intended to send to washington Mr. Balfour&apos;s draft telegram with regard to placing theactivities of the Allied Political Mission to Siberia under an Americanhead.Mr. Balfour said that he had made this suggestion in order toparry public opinion in the United States that the British Govern-ment were undertaking intervention in Siberia in order to serve theirown ends.The War Cabinet decided That Mr. Balfour should send a reply to Lord Reading&apos;s tele-gram based on the memorandum read out by the PrimeMinister, with so much of his own draft telegram as hethought fit, and that it should be mentioned that thematter had been discussed by the Imperial War Cabinet.
10. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Office (G.T.-5073) in regard to the liability to MilitaryService of Subjects or Citizens of Neutral States who were born inthe United Kingdom, but who have made a declaration of alienage,and are no longer Baitish subjects.The War Cabinet requested Mr. Chamberlain to examine and decide this question on their behalf.Liability to military Service of citizens of NeutralStates.Man-Power:Mobility ofMunitions Labour.11. With reference to War Cabinet 446, Minute 7, the Ministerof Munitions described to the War Cabinet the position in the chiefengineering centres, as revealed by reports received during the fore-noon, with regard to the trouble which had arisen out of the plan forrationing skilled labour. It had been decided in Manchester to handin notices that night, and in Birmingham the men were insisting onthe withdrawal of the embargo. No notices had been rendered inLeeds, Glasgow, Bristol, or Cardiff. A meeting of shop stewards heldat Sheffield had been sparsely attended. In Coventry the positionhung in the balance.   There was evidence that certain individualsconvoy all the same, but without the men, and the cargo space had had been lost. He stated that in several cases cargo convoys hadconsisted of as many as forty ships.Admiral Duff confirmed this latter statement, and added thathe raised no objection to ships without troops on board accompanyinga troop convoy, inasmuch as they could be used as a screen, and thusafford protection to the troop transports. In fact, the seventroopships that had not been permitted to carry troops in therecent instance had accompanied the &quot; Halifax &quot; convoy with cargoon board.Questioned as to what would be the effect on the convoy of thetorpedoing of, say, two troop transports, Admiral Duff stated that itwould probably be necessary for four of the destroyers to remainbehind to save life, which meant a 50 per cent, reduction in the escort, thereby increasing the danger in case of further attack tothe rest of the convoy by, say, 100 per cent.The First Lord of the Admiralty repeated to the War Cabinetthe arguments which he had laid before them (War Cabinet 447,Minute 4) as to the increased demand for more stringest convoyconditions that will be made on us by the United States in theevent of a serious loss of life, and he therefore considered it wiser to be content with getting the troops across somewhat slower ratherthan risk the dangers that would arise in other directions, if we were forced to augment the strength of the escort. He laid some stressthat the risk of disaster in a convoy was always present, and there-fore he deprecated any material increase in the risk.Lord Milner stated that the present supply of about 300,000troops a month from the United States would probably be kept upuntil the end of September 1918, and that these troops were coming in now as fast as they could be made use of.\ A loss in the number of drafts received from this source of from30,000 to 40,000 a month would not materially affect the situation,and he would prefer to lose the services of such a number ratherthan take the risk of a disaster occurring to a troop convoy.Sir Robert Borden expressed the opinion that we should be guided in this matter by the advice of the Admiralty, especiallyhaving regard to the First Lord&apos;s statement that the present escortswere only sufficient to ensure comparative safety.The War Cabinet confirmed their provisional decision (WarCabinet 447, Minute 4), that not more than fourteen vessels convey-ing troops should be grouped together in any one convoy, from north america.
were systematically fomenting trouble, but no legal action had beentaken against them up to the present, and he (Mr. Churchill) hadrefrained from any official or public announcement that he wouldhave recourse to the powers authorised by the War Cabinet on the16th July. But it was clear that the Government had reached apoint where to shrink from using those powers, if found necessary,would be disastrous to the whole future of their relations with labourduring the war. If the present situation were firmly handled, thoserelations would, he believed, be immensely improved. The issue which had been raised was one which the Government could join with every confidence of obtaining the full support of the public andof the press. As an example of the weakness of the men&apos;s case,Mr. Churchill mentioned that, side by side with the embargo, therewas an unsatisfied demand in the country for 60,000 skilled men.Mr. Egberts expressed the opinion that the Coventry workmen,whose notices terminated that night, would probably not go to thelength of a strike.The War Cabinet considered a suggestion made by the Ministerof Munitions that it might be desirable to have a statement of theGovernments policy made in the House of Commons that afternoonon a motion for the adjournment of the House.The War Cabinet decided To postpone such a statement, in order to see what developmentstook place in Coventry at the termination of the notices.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 22, 1918.o
