The Western 1. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that theres&apos;ront- was no news from the Western front beyond that contained inthe morning&apos;s telegrams, with the exception that the French had made a small attack on the Ailette on the previous day, capturing600 prisoners and a few guns. The Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff stated that, for the American operations at St. Mihiel,General Pershing had been under General Petain&apos;s orders, and not directly under Marshal Foch.Attention was drawn to a War Office telegram (No. 66437 ofthe 16th September, 1918) to the Military Attache at Madrid,which stated that it was probable in the near future that theposition on the Western front would again become stabilised, andthat the enemy&apos;s retirement was thought to be at an end. TheChief of the Imperial General Staff said that he had not seen this telegram, but, in view of the pessimistic tenour which it was thought to exhibit, would enquire from which department it hademanated.Salorrica. 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theAllied forces at Salonica had advanced on a front of 15 miles to adepth of 5 miles.Trans-Caucasia. 3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that General Dunsterville had evacuated Baku and reached Enzeli with a force of some 1,200 men. It was not knownhow many out of this number were British troops.Control of AlliedOperations in siberia.4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff drew attentionto several telegrams which had been received from General Knox,some of which had not been circulated to the War Cabinet,regarding the differences of opinion which existed as to theresponsibility for the formation and control of the new russian army in Siberia. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff saidthat amongst our Allies there seemed to be a general disinclinationto entrust this task to a British officer. The Americans and theFrench favoured the idea of a Frenchman being chosen.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that ourrelations with the United States at the moment were not of thebest. The Americans had got into their heads that we wished to push them into a policy that they did not like, and the unfortunatemistake recently committed by General Poole at Archangel hadrather confirmed them in this impression.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that theimmediate question on which he desired a War Cabinet decision was whether approval should be given to a request put forward by General Knox that he should be allowed to go ahead with raising3,000 men with the assistance of General Dietrichs. General Knoxhad also stated that the fact that no one person had been appointedto co-ordinate the efforts of raising a Russian army was leading to a certain amount of confusion, and that he himself was quitewilling to waive his claims, so long as someone was appointed. Helaid stress on the point that it would be for the bad if some steps were not taken at once.It was suggested that General Knox should be authorised toproceed with the raising of the 3,000 men, and that the ultimatecommand could be settled by the Supreme War Council. It waspointed out, however, that, as the Japanese were supplying theCommander-in-Chief for the whole expedition, they should havea voice in the question as to who was to be charged with the raising of the Russian levies, but they had no representative at Versailles.
Ill3 WG 473It was agreed that no body other than the Supreme WarCouncil existed which could settle a matter of this nature.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in conjunc-tion with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff,should draft a telegram to General Knox, authorisinghim to proceed with the raising of 3,000 Russians, butstating that the ultimate control of collecting russian troops for the Siberian Army would be settled by the versailles Council. The telegram should also warnGeneral Knox to be careful in his relations with theFrench and American representatives in Siberia on thissubject.(&amp;.) It was advisable that information as to the steps it was proposed to take should be communicated to the French,and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should consider with the Chief of the Imperial General staff the form in which this communication should be made.H.M.S.&quot; G-latton.&quot; 5. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that   a seriousexplosion occurred on board H.M.S. &quot; Glatton&quot; on the 16thSeptember, in Dover Harbour. After one and a half hours&apos; attemptto extinguish the fire, and as the magazines could not be flooded,the ship was sunk by a torpedo in the harbour. It was feared thatthere were numerous casualties. Admiral Hope stated that theloss of this Monitor was rather serious, as there was a long-rangegun on board.6. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that two F.A. andtwo D.H. machines, whilst on patrol, sighted six hostile aircraftabout noon on the I6th September, 12 miles East of Shipwash LightVessel. The hostile aircraft were of smaller span than the D.H.machines. One German seaplane was seen to have been set on fire,but was lost sight of by our machines. Admiral Hope also statedthat a report had been received from Dunkirk to the effect that,in addition to a considerable amount of bombing, eleven enemyaeroplanes had been destroyed and seven driven down out of con-trol. A balloon at Ostend has also been shot down in flames. Twoof our machines were missing.Shipping Losses; 7. The First Sea Lord of the Admiralty stated that he hadbeen asked to give the estimated shipping losses for this month. Ifwe assumed that the losses for the remainder of September con-tinued on about the same level as they had done for the first fort-night, we should have lost for the whole month 217,000 tons throughmarine peril and war loss. There was, however, no basis orreason for this assumption. Up to date we had ourselves lost76,000 tons out of 98,000 tons which had been lost by the Alliesby enemy action. Sir Eric Geddes stated that the Cabinet mustnot look for reduced shipping losses, as the situation was likelyto get worse, owing to the fact that we were not sinking so manysubmarines as formerly, mainly in consequence of the require-ments for convoy of American troops, and that the enemy were making a greater effort in output and in increased activity.8. General Sykes said that there were good indications of ashortage in Germany of aircraft material and personnel. Therewere also indications that the enemy had diverted several aircraft units from the West to the East of the Western front. Theprevious day on the Western front was one of the most successful473] B 2Aerial Engage-ments.Air Activities.
days we had yet had ; we destroyed 46 enemy machines and drovedown 20 out of control, whilst we ourselves had only lost 16. Onthe previous day we had dropped 23-^ tons of bombs by day, and15 tons by night. No report had been received regarding theoperations of the Independent Air Force for the 16th September.Horse-Bacing. 9. With reference to War Cabinet 434, Minute 5, lord curzon drew the attention of the War Cabinet to a letter whichhad&apos; been received from Mr. Horatio Bottomley, Chairman of theRacing Emergency Committee. In this letter Mr. Bottomley asked that, as he was most desirous of avoiding any public agitation onthe question of the restriction of winter racing, the War cabinet should write him a letter, which he might put before his Committee,saying that they would be prepared to reconsider the question of winter racing if approached by the National Hunt Committee,assuming that the railway position and other circumstances made such a course possible.After a short discussion, in which it was pointed out that theWar Cabinet had arrived at the decisions on the subject of racing,already announced, on the grounds of interference with essential war traffic on the railways by race meetings, the War cabinet decided that The Secretary should reply to Mr. Bbttomley to the effect thatthe War Cabinet would, of course, consider anyresponsible representations which were made to them onthe subject of winter racing under National Hunt Rules,but that they were not justified in holding out hopes thatthe decision of the Government on this question, whichwas based exclusively on considerations affecting the prosecution of the war, would be departed from.Gallipoli 10. The War Cabinet had under consideration the followingDecorations. memoranda and letters on the question of the award of a decorated-tion for the operations in Gallipoli: Memorandum by Mr. Chamberlain (Paper G.T.-5348).Memorandum by Mr. Barnes (Paper GjT.-5386).Letter from the National Federation of Demobilised sailors and Soldiers to the Prime Minister (Paper G.T.-5394).Memorandum by Mr. Montagu (Paper G.T.-5413).Letter from Sir C. M.  Barlow, with memorandum from members of Parliament (Paper G.T.-5465).Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War (paper g.T.-5558).Memorandum   by   the   Minister   of   Munitions   (paper g.T.-5614).Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty (paper g.T.-5693).Mr. Chamberlain, alluding to the proposal that a committeeshould be constituted to discuss this question, which had been putforward by the First Lord of the Admiralty in his memorandum(Paper G.T.-5693), said that he considered this course was desir-able. At the same time he was of opinion that the committeeshould be presided over by someone who had personal knowledgeof the Parliamentary situation, and who was in touch with publicopinion on this subject. It was also important that this com-mittee should have before it all the Cabinet memoranda on thesubject, and the many representations from public bodies and individuals which had been sent to the Prime Minister and theW^ar Cabinet.
5WG 4=73The Adjutant-General also welcomed the proposal to form acommittee to deal with this question, and proposed amendments tothe composition of the proposed committee, which were accepted and are embodied in the decision given below.Speaking on behalf of the Secretary of State for India, whowas unable to attend, General Macdonogh said that Mr. Montaguconcurred in this proposal, and desired that General Cox, theMilitary Secretary for India, should be one of the members of thecommittee.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) A committee, constituted as under: The Deputy Minister of Munitions (Chairman);Rear-Admiral A. F. Everett, C.B. (Naval Secretary tothe First Lord of the Admiralty);Sir Oswyn A. R. Murray, K.C.B. (Permanent Secretaryto the Admiralty);The Adjutant-General, or his representative;Sir Reginald Ff. Brade, K.C.B. (Secretary of the WarOffice);The Right Hon. Sir F. Ponsonbv, K.C.B.;Lieutenant-General Sir H. V. Cox, K.C.M.G., C.B.,C.S.I.;The Director of Air Personal Services (Air Ministry),should meet and consider all the problems involved in granting decorations for operations during the war,and that a report should be rendered as soon as possibleto the War Cabinet for their consideration on the ques-tion of the issue of a decoration in connection with theoperations in Gallipoli.(b.) All papers in connection with this question, including those circulated to the War Cabinet, should be referredto the committee.Pensions of 11. The War Cabinet had under consideration a note by officers&apos; Widows. Mr. Chamberlain (Paper G.T.-5471), and memoranda by theMinister of Pensions (Paper G.T.-5500), and by the Secretary ofState for War (Paper G.T.-5535), on the subject of pensions ofofficers&apos; widows.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Pensionsexplained that there had been no increase of officers&apos; widows&apos;pensions granted under the old warrant, with one exception,namely, that the pensions of widows of subalterns had been brought up to the same level as those of the widows of captains. The.pensions of disabled officers had been raised, but as officers&apos;widows&apos; pensions had not been raised above the amount granted informer wars, with the exception to which he had alluded, therewas no case for any alteration in the scale of the pensions for the widows of officers (above the rank of lieutenant) who had fallen in former wars. It was true that the pensions of widows of non-commissioned officers and men who had fallen in former wars hadbeen brought up to the same level as the pensions granted for thepresent war.Mr. Chamberlain pointed out that the children&apos;s allowances for the children of officers killed in the present war had been increased, and expressed the opinion that at any rate it was only fair that the amount of pensions awarded to widows of officers who had fallen in former wars should be brought up to the same level as that at present in force. In former days the pension pay-able to the wife of an officer killed in action, who was above the rank of colonel, was not paid on any fixed rate, each case being
investigated on its merits. The rates for all senior ranks had nowbeen fixed, and Mr. Chamberlain urged that, if any widow of anofficer of senior rank was now receiving less than the fixed rate, theamount of her pension should be raised to that rate. Mr.Chamberlain also invited the Ministry of Pensions to investigateas to whether the scale of pensions now payable to officers&apos;1widows should not be reconsidered as a whole, in view of the factthat the pensions of widows of non-commissioned officers and men had been increased, and in view of the greatly increased cost ofliving. He suggested that the sum of 200Z. for the widow of acolonel, and 140Z. for the widow of a major, was insufficient at thepresent time.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The &quot;highest rate &quot; of the pensions of the widows ofsubaltern officers killed in former wars, namely, SOI.,should be raised to 100Z.(5.) The pensions of widows of - officers above the rank of colonel killed in action, or whose death was due towar service in former wars, should be paid at the fixedrate now payable to widows of officers of similar rank,provided that no widow&apos;s pension should be reduced bythis decision.(c.) The Minister of Pensions should forward a memorandum for the consideration of the War Cabinet, setting forth the exact position in regard to the pensions of the widows of officers, N.C.O.&apos;s, and men, and the stagesby &quot;which it had been reached.Allied maritime transport Council.12. The War Cabinet took note of the decisions of the allied maritime Transport Council at meetings held on the 29th and 30thAugust, 1918 (Paper G.T.-5621).Employment ofIndian army personnel with theEoyal Air Foreein Egypt.13. The War Cabinet approved the proposals of the air council, as approved by the India Office, to employ Indian army personnel with the Eoyal Air Force in Egypt (Papers A. P. C, 7thMinutes, G.T.-5653).t2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.September 17, 1918.o
