The Western 1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff, who had just*ront&apos; returned from France, reported that there was not much information in addition to that which the War Cabinet had already received.Enemy resistance was stiffening all along the line, and neitherMarshal Foch nor Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig proposed to make further attacks for the present unless they could advance without undue expenditure of life. The Allied Generals were, however,testing one or two places which they particularly wished to capture,because it seemed that if these places were taken the enemy wouldbe obliged to fall back farther. It would be seen in the course ofthe next forty-eight hours whether these operations were worthundertaking.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff continued that he had seen General Currie. He had also seen General Monash, com-manding the Australians, with his five Divisional Generals, whowere all much pleased with the result of their recent operations,more especially with the smallness of the losses incurred. the casulties of each of the five Divisional Generals had only amountedto about (500 apiece. The casualties of the enemy, on the otherhand, appeared to have been very heavy, because the Germans hadbeen pushed back so rapidly that they could not get away owing tothe congestion of the roads. The total number of German prisonerstaken by the British and French in these operations amounted toabout 30,000, together with some 400 to 500 guns. The total losses of the Allies had been about 30,000, of which British losses were about 20,000.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the tanks had done splendid work. The number of tanks put out of action,whether lost or disabled, amounted to about 00 per cent, of thetotal, but many of these were not lost to the enemy, and could be repaired shortly. The temporary casualties to tanks were duechiefly to engine troubles and over-heating. The tank personnelhad done very well, but it had become clear that there must be twoor three relays of personnel, owing to the fact that the crewsbecame exhausted in the intense heat inside the tanks.Asked as to whether he considered it probable that the enemy would make a stand on the Vesle, General Wilson replied that hethought so. He added that their position would be so uncomfortablethat he had from the first favoured the idea of leaving them there,and he believed that this was Marshal Foch/s intention, but that itwas not unlikely that the Germans would before long re-cross theAisne.The enemy appeared to have nineteen reserve divisions, ofwhich fifteen were with Prince Rupprecht, two with the crown prince, and two with Prince AlbrechtProof of the deterioration of the enemy was evidenced in thefact that the 1st Australian Division, with but small losses to them-selves, had so completely knocked out the 5th Bavarian Divisionthat, in the opinion of the Australian Commanders, it seemed unlikelythat the latter unit would be able to recover for two months.Trans-Caucasia. 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that thelatest news from Mesopotamia indicated that British troops were still in Baku, and that the Turks did not even claim to be in it.The situation, however, was one of anxiety.3. The Prime Minister reported that at a meeting of the Com-mittee of Prime Ministers, held on the previous day, it had beendecided to send a message of congratulation to Field-marshal sir Douglas Haig on his recent brilliant operations.The Prime Minister undertook to send this message-in the nameof the Imperial War Cabinet.Message of congratulation toField-marshal sir Douglas Haig.
Damaged ^ l0^ei 5. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that a message  from dunkirk reported that direct hits had been obtained on the stern ofan enemy destroyer on the 10th August, off De Haan, when other vessels closed round the damaged destroyer. A very big explosionwas seen to occur in the position of the damaged ship. All our machines had returned safely, but one of our pilots had beenaccidentally killed by crashins.Operations in the heligoland Bight.6. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that one of a series ofsmall operations, designed to hamper minesweeping and to preserve the initiative in the Heligoland Bight, had been carried out underthe direction of the Rear-Admiral,- Harwich Force, on the 11thAugust, during the course of which Lieutenant Culley, in anaeroplane which was carried on a lighter towed by a destroyer, was sent up after, and attacked and brought down, a Zeppelin in flamesfrom a height of about 19,000 feet, about 15 miles N.N.E. ofAmeland. Six coastal motor-boats, which had approached theGerman coast, had been attacked by 14 enemy aircraft with bombs and machine-guns, and forced to take refuge in Dutch waters. Allhands were saved, but three of the motordooats had been destroyed,and three had been taken charge of by the Dutch authorities.Reports from Holland indicated that there was great activity amongthe German forces off the River Ems after this operation.War Aims.Review by theSecretary ofState for ForeignAffairs.7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gave the imperial war Cabinet a general survey7 of our aims and obligations over thewhole field of politics. Touching upon our obligations, by treaty or by declaration, to our Western Allies, France and Italy, he expressed the view that any suggestions of compromise with regardto those obligations would have to come from France and Italy,and not from ourselves.With regard to the Central European question, which nowincluded the whole field from the Arctic Ocean to the JEgean, he pointed out that an issue which had to be decided on the thresholdof the whole question was that of the fate of Austria-Hungary,and gave his reasons for concluding that the breaking up ofAustria-Hungary on national lines would be the best solution inthe general interest. With regard to Poland, he suggested that the promise given both at Versailles and by President Wilson, to secure for Poland free access to the sea, opened a wider question which affected the position of all inland countries, and which mightTTsefully be taken in hand by the League of Nations. His general conclusion with regard to Poland was that we should insist on freenavigation of the Vistula, secure an ethnological frontier for PolandSubmarines. 4. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that there had recentlybeen four or five attacks made on enemy submarines.   One of these had taken place on the Sth instant, 10 miles from Start Point.   Theposition of the submarine had been bombed, and an electric lightfjv bulb marked &quot; Vienna &quot; had come to the surface.   It was consideredthat a U.C. submarine had been destroyed. On another occasionan enemy submarine was bombed by a seaplane, on the 9th August,5 miles from Scarborough. A report had been received from dunkirk to the effect that during an observation patrol a direct hitwas obtained with a 230-lb. bomb alongside the conning-tower of a submarine. The submarine had rolled over, and remained afloatfor about five minutes, during which seven more bombs were released.   The submarine then sank.
on the east, and leave the difficult question of the western frontier ofPoland open to deal with when we knew to what extent we hadbeaten Germany. Continuing to describe the principles of mutualconflict and common dependence upon herself on which Germany wasbuilding up the ring of border States which she had carved out ofRussia, he insisted that the breaking down of the Brest-LitovskTreaty must be an essential object of our policy. That would bethe most effective Avay of disposing of the dangers in the MiddleHast, with regard to which Lord Curzon had warned the imperial war Cabinet (Imperial War Cabinet No. 20, Minute 5). Brieflyindicating the outlines of the position in the Balkans, he laid stress upon the great difficulty created by Greek and Serbiananimosity against Bulgaria.In the Near East our chief diplomatic difficulties were created by the Sykes-Picot Agreement, which, though still remaining as a diplomatic instrument, was historically out of date, and by thejealousy between France and Italy. He alluded to the great workof reconstruction already achieved in Palestine and Mesopotamia,and to the impossibility of letting those countries relapse underTurkish rule. There was also, in the case of Alesopotamia, the vital necessity for the British Empire to secure a settlement which wouldnot endanger our facilities for obtaining oil from this region.As regards the German Colonies, he mentioned that his own views and those of other members of the Imperial Cabinet hadalready been stated in a series of papers (P.-25, G.-182, G.T.-4774,G.T.-4816, and. G.T.-5132). He summed up his own views by saying that he was vehemently opposed to restoring to the Germansany opportunity of creating new submarine bases or levying armies of black troops ; that he considered that Australia, New Zealand,and South Africa should retain the adjacent German Colonies whichthey had conquered ; as regards the remaining German african colonies, while he realised the objections to every plan which mightbe put forward, he thought it desirable that, after all our dis-inferested professions, we should try to avoid coming out of this war with accessions of territory compared with which those of other states would sink into insignificance.Sir Robert Borden expressed his general agreement with Mr.Balfours views as to the German Colonies. The people of Canadawere not willing to fight for the mere sake of extending the terri-tories of the Empire. If that Empire was to remain a worldinstitution, it would have to rely not only On the British Dominionsbut also on the co-operation and support of the United States. Themore it was possible to get the United States to undertake responsi-bility in world affairs, the better for the world as a whole and for theBritish Empire. For his own part, speaking of the German Coloniesgenerally, and not dealing with the specific interests which otherDominions might have with respect to some of them, he would be perfectly ready to let any of these Colonies pass under the directprotectorate or even the actual ownership and control of theUnited States- The real difficulty would be the reluctance of the americans themselves to depart from their historic policy. As tothe League of Peace its purpose commanded our best effort even ifwe were not convinced of its enduring practicability. The firstattempt to assure international order might be through a &quot; VigilanceCommittee &quot; of respectal.de and powerful nations.Mr. Massey asked if it was intended to go back on the reportsof the Imperial War Cabinet Committees, more particularly thatwhich had been presided over by Lord Curzon, which dealt very fully with these questions, and had submitted definite conclusions ?The Prime Minister considered that those conclusions were certainly still subject to discussion.Lord Reading, dealing with the suggestion that the UnitedStates might be asked to act as a trustee for the Powers in Palestine,considered that such a suggestion would appeal very strongly.to the
The League of 8. Lord Robert Cecil raised the question whether the report ofNations: Lord Phillimore&apos;s Committee should not be published.   In view of publication of the    the clanger of the whole subject being drowned in a welter ofPhillimore Report.    plausible faddist schemes, it would be desirable to set up a standardsuch as would be furnished by the conclusions of a body of men whohad seriously faced the practical difficulties.   It need not necessarily be published as expressing the views of the Cabinet.Lord Reading pointed out that President Wilson was very anxious that nothing should be published here which might appearto commit the British Government until he had submitted his own views to them. For some time past, he had discountenanced publicagitation on the subject of the League of Nations, not because be had changed his views, but because he thought the moment inopportune.It was at his instance, in fact, that a great League of Nations meeting had been converted into a &quot;win the war&quot; convention. He would,however, have his memorandum on the question completed in another two or three weeks, and would then submit it to the BritishGovernment. He did not think that the President was doing thismerely for the sake of getting in first with the publication of his views.Mr. Hughes suggested that it was desirable that the imperial war Cabinet should come to a definite conclusion about its own policy in the matter before it committed itself to the publication ofa document which dealt with the policy in detail. General state-ments such as that to which the Prime Minister had confined himselfrecently were quite harmless.The Prime Minister considered that there were two chiefobjections to publication besides the personal objections of PresidentWilson. There was first of all the fact that if published the scheme would inevitably be regarded as inspired by the Government, andtherefore it ought not to be published until it had received at least a second reading approval from the Imperial War Cabinet;secondly he was very afraid that the publication of any scheme at such a time would take away the people&apos;s mind from that victory which was the only sure basis of any League of Nations. The end. &apos; . of the war was still a long way off and Germany was nowhere nearaccepting tolerable terms    But she might quite easily say, &quot;WeUnited States both in view of their general idealism and of thepolitical importance of the Jewish element in their population.Generally speaking, as long as President Wilson remained at thehead of affairs, America would not stand at the Peace Conference for direct annexation either by herself or by others. As the warprogressed she would, however, be increasingly against giving backterritory to an unregenerate Germany. In this connection thearguments used by Mr. Hughes with regard to New Guinea andthe Pacific, had had considerable effect. We should have to trywherever possible to secure our aims by methods which fell short of direct territorial acquisition.Mr. Chamberlain pointed out that the United States had notsaid anything in this &quot;war against territorial acquisition stronger than the declarations made on the outbreak of the Spanish-Americanwar, when it thanked God that, unlike airy other people, america had entered into a war without any idea of gaining territory.The Prime Minister suggested that if we approached the UnitedStates with a view to their undertaking the responsibilities of trusteeship, say for Palestine and one of the German african colonies, they might be prepared to recognise our trusteeshipelsewhere, as for instance in Mesopotamia.The further discussion of the question of war aims was post-poned to 3&apos;30 p.m. on Wednesday, the 14th August.
