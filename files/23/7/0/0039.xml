Labour Committee. 1. Mr. CHAMBERLAIN suggested that, in order to save thetime of the Cabinet, a Committee should be set up to deal with questions of Labour, on lines similar to those of the Home AffairsCommittee.The War Cabinet instructed The Secretary to place this question on the Agenda Paper at anearly date.Palestine. 2. In continuation of War Cabinet 475, Minute 3, the Chief of, the Imperial General Staff reported that General Allenby&apos;s troops had occupied Haifa and Acre. The 5th Cavalry Division had entered Haifa on the morning of the previous day, and had met with only slight hostile opposition. The enemy were now withdrawingnorthwards, pursued by Australian and New Zealand troops, and bythe 38th and 39th Battalions of the Royal Fusiliers. Large numbersof enemy prisoners had been taken, in excess of the figures alreadypublished. Our advanced guards had now reached Es Salt. It wasnot yet known how many Germans had been captured among theenemy prisoners.   &apos;As far as was known, there were between 4,000 and 6,000 Turksacross the Jordan. There was also a small number at Medina, butthe bulk of the Turkish forces had gone north and were surroundedby hostile Arabs. It was not improbable that we should capture thewhole of the Turkish force on the east of the Jordan.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that satisfactorynews had been received to the effect that, as the result of general allenby&apos;s victory, the Turks had withdrawn one of their divisions from the Caucasus.With regard to the suggestion which had been made to general allenby by telegram on the previous day, that he should considerthe possibility of a cavalry raid on Aleppo, General Wilson saidthat there appeared to be nothing except the distance to prevent this operation.The question was raised as to whether there was any likelihood of General Marshall being able to strike at the Turks in somedirection, and thereby co-operate in the general movement of driving the Turks back. It was pointed out that General MarshalTschief difficulty appeared to lie in his lack of transport facilities, andin this connection the suggestion was made that some of the large amount of transport that had been captured from the Turks mightbe useful to General Marshall.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, when the list of General Allenby&apos;s booty was known, it would be seen what could be done in assisting General Marshall in that direction.Naval Assistance. 3, As regards the naval assistance rendered in the recent operations in Palestine, the First Sea Lord reported that two of our destroyers had shelled a small detached body of enemy troops30 miles north of Jaffa, on 18th September, and had taken part inGeneral All.enby&apos;s attack on the 19th.Congratulations to 4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarGeneral Allenby.      Cabinet that he had drafted a tele gram of congratulation to general allenby for submission to the Prime Minister, who, he understood,was making certain alterations in it.The War Cabinet decided that A message of congratulation, as approved by the Prime Minister,should be sent to General Allenby.\
121The Western Front. 6. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that our right-hand corps, the IXth, and the whole of the First French army had attacked that morning opposite St. Quentin, but that no news had yet been received as to the result.mesopotamia commission :disciplinary action.7. With reference to War Cabinet 175, Minute 2, Mr. Chamber-lain called the attention of the War Cabinet to the fact that theArmy Council, to whom the report of the Mesopotamia Commissiouhad been referred, had exonerated Sir John Nixon. Mr. Chamberlainexpressed the view that there ought to be a public announcement tothis effect.Mr. Chamberlain undertook to ask the Secretary of State forIndia to take up the matter with the Secretary of State forWar.Publication of sir douglas Haig&apos;despatch.8. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to the fact thata certain amount of mischief was being caused by the allegationthat Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s despatch in regard to theGerman offensive which developed on the 21st March, 1918, wasbeing withheld.It was stated that certain alterations in the despatch had beensuggested to Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, and that this was thereason of the delay.The War Cabinet were of opinion that it was advisable for thedespatch to be published as soon as possible, and asked The Secretary of State for War to take the necessary steps inthe matter.Bombing ofConstantinople.9. The First Sea Lord reported that during the night of the20th-21st September two of our machines had left Mudros forConstantinople. One machine had to return on account of enginetrouble. The other reached her objective and dropped two 65- and eight 16-lb. bombs and pamphlets. Bursts were observed in HaidarPasha Station, on buildings north of the Admiralty, and on houses in Stamboul. A machine had also left Mudros for Constantinopleon the night of the 21st-22nd September, but had failed to return.Macedonia. 5. With reference to War Cabinet 475, Minute 4, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff said that good progress was being madeon the Macedonian front. The Serbians, who were operating onthe west of the British front, had succeeded in cutting the Vardarline between Gradsko and Demir Kapu. The result of this wouldprobably be that the Bulgarian troops opposite the British wouldbe cut off, for feeding purposes, from their main body. It seemed likely that the Bulgarians would now make a stand, if they could,on the Vardar, facing south-west instead of facing south, as theyhad been doing.General Wilson then explained on a map the plan of campaign. in another direction. The original Btdgar line had occupied all theavailable troops of the enemy, and if his line were now lengthenedhe would not have sufficient troops to hold it. His left wing mightbe turned, and in any case he could not now rest both his flanks onsafe places.With regard to the British advance, which had been made on either side of Lake Doiran, and had been referred to in the above-mentioned minute as not having resulted in any considerable progress, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that later information from General Milne reported that our attack hadpunished the enemy rather more heavily than had at first beensupposed, and that by our attacks we had contained large numbersof the Bulgars.
Eailway Strike. m With reference t0 War Cabinet 475, Minute 11, the WarCabinet had before them a memorandum on railway unrest by thePresident of the Board of Trade (Paper G.T-5754).Sir Albert Stanley stated that the strike, which had started on sunday night in South Wales, was showing signs of spreading to anumber of other areas. The men were out at Plymouth and atBristol, and very few trains were being worked on the GreatWestern Railway. In the London area, on the North-Westernsystem, Willesden, Bow, and Plaistow were affected. The men hadorganised picketing, and were evidently hoping to extend the striketo other railways. Mr. J. H. Thomas and Mr. Bromley had gonedown to Newport on the previous evening with a view to addressingthe men, but they had been refused a hearing, and the meeting hadbeen broken in upon by some wounded soldiers. Mr. Thomas andMr. Bromley were endeavouring to meet the men in Newport that morning, but with what success was not yet known. There were signs that the men on strike did not believe the decision come to last week to be final, and he (Sir Albert Stanley) had therefore made it perfectly plain to both leaders that, while the Government were always prepared to meet the Executives of the Railway Unions,there was not the slightest chance of the Government receding fromthe decision reached on Thursday last. In the event of the efforts to terminate the strike that day proving unavailing, he wished theauthority of the Cabinet to deal with picketing, to protect railwayproperty, and to continue working the trains as far as possible. Forthese purposes the co-operation of the War Office would be necessary.He proposed to invite representatives of the leading newspapers tomeet him that afternoon, and he would explain fully to them the steps which the Government had decided to take to deal with thesituation. He was confident that the attitude of the press would bein complete accord with the policy of the Government.Sir Herbert Walker stated that the Railway Executive were ofopinion that the Government should not delay action until thefollowing morning, but should issue a notice, say at 6 p.m. that day,announcing that the military would be called out immediately toprotect men remaining at work, and to safeguard railway property.It was important also not only to be able to place an embargo on the funds of the Unions, but to have picketing stopped ; but he doubted whether the police or the soldiers had legal power to stop picketing.Sir George Cave said that he thought that&quot; picketing, in so faras it affected munitions of war, could be dealt with under theDefence of the Realm Act (Clause 42), and that, if that were notadequate, a fresh Regulation could be made. In reply to a sug-gestion, Sir George Cave said that to proclaim martial law would hardly give the Government greater legal powers than could beobtained under the Defence of the Realm Act.General Seeley stated that, if the strike continued for three days, it would stop altogether the output of gas and bring a numberof filling factories to a standstill. It was important, in any public announcement, to dwell on the urgent needs of the Army and Navy.General Childs said that, in the previous strike in South Wales,the most effective method of dealing with picketing had been foundto be to proceed under the Protection of Property Act. The main difficulty had been to protect the property of the men remaining atwork, and to do that thoroughly required a considerable body oftroops.Lord Reading said it was not desirable to say in terms that theGovernment were. challenging peaceful picketing, because thatmight excite the South Wales miners.Lord Milner thought that it was desirable that some responsibleperson should see the chief press associations and inform them intime for that day&apos;s evening papers that the Government intended touse all the resources of the State to secure the necessary supplies forour soldiers and sailors, the transport of the wounded, and the
The Coal Situation. 11. With reference to War Cabinet 470, Minute 8, the WarCabinet had under consideration a memorandum by the Coal Con-troller (Paper G.T.-5597), a memorandum by the Minister of Labour. (Paper G.T.-5533), and a letter from Sir A. Nimmo to the PrimeMinister (Paper G.T.-5737) on the subject of the coal situation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had already dis-cussed this question with the Secretary of State for War&quot; and was ofopinion that it would be advisable that a Committee, composed ofrepresentatives of the Ministry of National Service, the War Office,and the Board of Trade, should be set up, in order that a definiteplan should be prepared for the best and quickest method by whichminers could be released to the mines from the three fighting Ser-vices if the War Cabinet decided that such a course was essential inthe national interest. A report on this question had already been rendered (Paper G.T.-5589), as a result of a decision of a conferenceheld on the 31st August, but this report did not go into detail. Itwould be desirable for this Committee to prepare plans based on thetwo alternatives, namely, returning men from France, or from thoserecently recruited.The Adjutant-General said that of the 25,000 miners to1 be released in accordance with the decision of the AVar Cabinet, 15,200men had been returned to the mines by Sunday last.   Instructions hadconveyance to their homes of men arriving in this country on leave.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Government resist the strike and that no further concessions be discussed ;(b.) The personnel of the Eoyal Navy, Army, and Royal AirForce should be drawn on for the maintenance of essential traffic and for the protection of buildings,material, and the personnel remaining at work ;(c.) Picketing should be stopped, and that the Home secretary should consider the question of the power under whichthis is to be effected ;(d.) The President of the Board of Trade should take steps toput an embargo on the funds of the Unions concerned ;(e.) The President of the Board of Trade should do his utmost to bring public opinion on the side of the Government.To this end he should maintain close touch with thepress throughout the strike, and should acquaint themwith the nature of the action decided upon by the WarCabinet In particular, he should cause it to be knownthroughout the country in that day&apos;s evening papers thatthe Government had decided to resist the strike, andthat the fighting forces would be used for the purposesmentioned in (6);(/.) A Committee should be formed, with the followingcomposition: The President of the Board of Trade (Chairman),Representatives of the Admiralty,Representatives of the War Office,Representatives of the Air Department,Representatives of the Home Office,Representatives of the Ministry of Labour,Representatives of the Ministry of National Service,to remain in session during the strike, for the purpose ofco-ordinating the activities of the various departments in carrying out the above decisions, and generally indealina- with the strike.
also been sent to France to comb out miners from the Labour Corps,and it was expected that these might number some 10,000.Questioned as to whether the coal output had increased owingto propaganda and other efforts made to this end, the Coal Controllersaid that the output for the week ending the 14th September was,895,000 tons, as compared with an output of 3,591,000 tons for theweek ending the 3rd August. This was only for English and Welshmines, and, while there was considerable improvement, this improve-ment was mainly due to a recovery from the influenza epidemic andthe incidence of recruiting.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for War should call together a Com-mittee, composed of representatives of the Ministry ofNational Service, the Board of Trade, and the WarOffice, to decide on a detailed scheme for the withdrawalof miners from the army, which could be put in force at short notice if the War Cabinet decided that such a course was essential to meet the coal situation.Pood Prices and 12. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by subsidies. fae Yood Controller, directing the attention of the War Cabinet tothe increased prices of the necessaries of life and to the necessityof considering whether any portion of this increase should be borneby an extension of State subsidies already applied to bread (paper g.T.-5714). Mr. Clynes pointed out in his memorandum that, atrecent meetings of the Consumers&apos; Council and of the Trades UnionCongress, resolutions had been passed in support of extending thepolicy of subsidies to meat; but it was clear that the case of meatcould not be considered separately from the cases of other foodstuffsor other necessaries of life, whereas a cheap and plentiful supply of bread had always been regarded as essential. Mr. Clynes suggestedthat the War Cabinet should authorise one of their members to consult with a representative of the Treasury, the Ministry ofLabour, and the Food Controller, to consider whether any scheme&apos;could be framed for securing, by an extension of subsidies, a greater measure of industrial peace.The War Cabinet decided that It was not desirable to extend the policy of subsidies.13. With reference to War Cabinet 473, Minute 10, Mr, bonar law informed the War Cabinet that he had sought and receivedthe approval of His Majesty the King to the proposal to set up aCommittee to consider questions connected with the grant ofdecorations for war services in Gallipoli.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,September 24, 1918.GallipoliDecorations.o
