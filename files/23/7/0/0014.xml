T he Western Front:Divisions Engaged.1. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that 59German divisions had so far been identified &apos; in the fighting.Against this number General Foch used 49, but 7 of these hadbeen very lightly engaged, and had now gone back into reserve.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that indications stillpointed to an attack on the Hazebrouck-Ypres front. There hadbeen a drift of German artillery into this area, some of which had come from Russia. One cavalry division from Alsace and onecavalry division from Lorraine had also been located in this area.German DivisionsEmployed.2. With reference to Imperial War Cabinet 26, Minute 2, inwhich it had been stated that two of the Crown Prince&apos;s divisions had moved into Prince R.upprecht&apos;s army, the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff said that one of these divisions (the Fifth Branden-burgers) had now been identified in line on the River Ourcq, andthe other (the Fourth Guards division) had been identified inLorraine.Allied intervention in Siberia.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that a telegram had^been received from the captain ofH.M.S. &quot;Suffolk&quot; to the effect that he anticipated an attack by avery heavy force of the enemy at Vladivostock. The Chief of theImperial General Staff added that the battalion from Hong Kongwas due to arrive at Vladivostock on the 2nd August.The Use of chinese troops.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that aproposal had been made to His Majesty&apos;s Government and to theUnited States Government that a certain number of Chinese troops should be used in conjunction with the Allied force in Siberia.The United States had discouraged the proposal, and he (Mr. Balfour)was inclined to do the same, partly because the suggestion would encourage the idea that Allied intervention in Siberia was takingthe form of a 3&quot;ellow invasion.The War Cabinet approved of the action Mr. Balfour proposedto take.H.M.S.&quot; Marmora.&quot;5. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that H.M.S. &quot; Marmora&quot;had been torpedoed and sunk on the afternoon of the 23rd July22 miles from Fastnet.   Survivors had been picked up by &quot; P. G7.&quot;H.M.S. &quot; Pincher.&quot; 6. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that the destroyerH.M.S. :&apos; Pincher&quot; went ashore on Seven Stones on the morning ofthe 24th July and sank in about an hour. No news had yet beenreceived as to casualties.The Air Situation. 7. The   Chief  of  the  Air  Staff   stated  that   our  brigadeco-operating with the French in the battle had done well.Independent Air 8. The Chief of the Air Staff stated that on Sunday last he hadEorce. attended the Inter-Allied Aviation Committee of the Supreme WarCouncil at Versailles, when a further endeavour had been made toreach an agreement regarding the activities of the Independent AirForce. General Sykes stated that both the Italian and the UnitedStates representatives had made a great effort to come to some arrangement, but the French had placed difficulties in the way.General Sykes thought that, although no conclusions had been
Release from the 9. The War Cabinet had before them a summary of conclusionsqvn^-R^f^ 0f      reached by the Military Representatives at Versailles with regarding e    ai way-      t0 release   from   the Belgian Army of skilled railwaymen(G.T.-5176).The War Cabinet decided To support the action proposed by the Military Representativethat a further strong representation should be made to theBelgian Government with a view to obtaining a furthernumber of railway personnel, in order to relieve the trans-portation situation. They instructed the Secretary to request the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to takethe necessary diplomatic action.Soldiers&apos; and sailors&apos; pay committee :Parents&apos;Allowances.10. With reference to War Cabinet 449, Minute 15, the WarCabinet had under further consideration the sixth and supple-rnentary report of the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee (G.-217)and a memorandum showing the conditions under which parents&apos;allowances are granted to men serving with the armed forces ofAmerica, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, France, and Italy(G.T.-5203).Mr. Barnes made a brief statement dealing with the conditions under which parents&apos; allowances were granted in the Colonies and allied countries. Mr. Barnes pointed out that, with the exception ofFrance and Italy, pre-war dependence and substantial allotments oncomparative high rates of pay -were conditions on which separation allowances were paid, although there were certain exceptions asshown in the tabulated statement (G.T.-5203 s which approximatedto the conditions proposed to be set up by the recommendations ofthe Committee. The recommendations of the Committee on thissubject of parents&apos; allowances were fully set forward in the Reportof the Committee, and were to the effect that a flat rate of 3s. 6d.per week should be given as a rate to all parents of soldiers, sailors,or airmen, or more than 3s. fid. should be given up to the maximumpayable under the present rules if such pre-war dependency couldbe proved to the satisfaction of local Pensions Committee.The Minister of Pensions proposed that the flat rate of 3s. Qd.should be increased to one of 5s., and supported his argument infavour of the higher rate by urging that the rate of 5s. would notonly save a great deal, of administrative work, but would also, in hisopinion cost little, if any, more to the State. Questioned as to thecost of a flat rate of 5s. as compared with the 3s. 6a!. rate, recom-mended by the Committee, the Financial Secretary to the Admiraltysaid that, after consvdtation with the Financial Secretary to the WarOffice, he was of opinion that the cost should be roughly estimated,at 9,000,OOOL for these allowances, and at 2,600,000?. for pensions.-451] B 2reached, yet the meeting had done some good, inasmuch as theItalian and the United States representatives obtained some ideawhat the British Government desired the Independent Air force to develop into.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he had spoken to General Foch on this subject and that General Foch had saidthat when the fighting season was over he proposed to raise thequestion of the Independent Air Force. General Foch was of theopinion that either General Trenchard should come under his command, or that the Independent Air Force should move out ofFrance.The War Cabinet decided That the matter should be discussed at the next Meeting of the versailles Council.
This would raise the cost of the proposals of the Committee underthis heading from 6,700,OOOZ. to 11,600,000?., but if the lower ratewere adopted a large number of parents in receipt of the flat rate ofos. 6d. would undoubtedly be larger sum by the special grants Committee on the recommendation of the local pensions committee.It was agreed that the higher rate should be given now, mainly on the grounds that the grant of such a rate was the only fair wayof dealing with parents of men who had joined the colours in theearly clays of the war, and on the grounds that payment of thishigher rate would cause less administrative difficulties than if a lower rate were adopted. It was pointed out that the total cost ofthe proposals recommended by the Committee including- the costof pensions with the adoption of a 5s. rate would be approximately25,600,000?.The War Cabinet decided (a.) That the recommendations of the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos;Pay Committee under the heading of &quot; issue of allowances to the parents of unmarried apprentices,students, and youths on progressive wages,&quot; as putforward in paragraph 5 of the Sixth and supplementary report of the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee(G.-217) should be approved, subject to the amendmentthat the minimum flat rate of parents&apos; allowances shouldbe 5s. per week instead of 3s. Gd.(b.) That the decision of the War Cabinet on the subject of increased children&apos;s allowances and parents&apos; allowances should be set forward in a Command Paper and laid onthe table of the House of Commons on the 25th July.Man-Power:Mobility ofMunitions(Labour.11. With reference to War Cabinet 450, Minute 11, the Ministerof Munitions summarised the position in the chief engineeringcentres in relation to the embargo on the employment of skilled men. The reports indicated that in Coventry over 7,000 men had ceased work, some areas were threatening to cease work unless the embargo were removed, and others appeared to&apos;be undisturbed. Thegeneral impression conveyed by the reports was one of hesitation, asif the men were not quite certain of their powers. The promoters of discord were strenuously endeavouring to rouse the workmen, andthe question which the War Cabinet was called on to decide was whether they should allow the movement to spread before taking action, or whether they should act at once before the movementbecame much stronger. On the whole, he was prepared to advise the War Cabinet to act atcontaining a declarationexemption certificates withdrawn. (Mr. Churchill read a draftof the proposed statement.)that day. He had summoned the Trade Union Advisory Committeefor to-morrow, but it was useless to expect that they would take astrong line. The men were out to oppose conscription and dilution,and no doubt wished to take full advantage of the upward trend ofwages. The actual application of the embargo was limited to afew firms,, but the men saw therein a large issue, viz., the threat ofmilitary conscription if they resisted industrial conscription. Theonly weapon which the Government could use in the situation wasthe removal of the protection certificates, and the right of the state to use that weapon ought never to have been allowed to become anarguable question.Mr. Plodge suggested, and Mr. Churchill concurred, that in thenotice it should be clearly stated that the Military Service Actswould not be applied to men remaining at work.Mr. Roberts urged that it was important to allow the men timeonce by issuing a notice to the workmenthat men on strike would have theirr.The statement ought to be issued
to be fully seized of the implications on their conduct if they struckwork. He was not sure that the patriotic elements among theworkmen had grasped the character of the strike in which theywere asked to join. It was, further, important that nothing shouldbe done which would throw the Trade Unions into opposition. Forthat reason he held that the Minister of Munitions should consult the Trade Union Advisory Committee before taking any drasticsteps. He did not believe that that Committee would endorse theaction of the Coventry strikers.In reply to a question whether the issue of the proposed noticewould have the effect of throwing those Trade Unionists who werehesitating against the Government, Sir Stephenson Kent said thaton the Avhole there was no big movement in the country at themoment in favour of a strike. It was conceivable that many mightbe moved to strike if provoked by a threat of the Military service acts. On the other hand, if the shop stewards (whose Executivewas meeting&apos;that day in Sheffield j recommended a &quot; down tools&quot;policy, we should see at least as many more on strike to-morrow as there were to-day. He was in favour of action being taken at once, asthe strikers had defied their own local representatives, their TradeUnions, and the State. The organisation of the strikers was improving daily. The Amalgamated Society of Engineers had gone back on the position which they had taken up on Friday last,presumably because they were afraid of the strength of the shop stewards&apos; movement.The Prime Minister emphasised the importance of the Statewinning in the struggle with the strikers, if to put men into theArmy would help the State to win, then they should not hesitate touse the Military Service Acts, but it Was a mistake to extend un-necessarily the difficulties of the State. The present dispute bore astrong resemblance to the conflict which, as Minister of Munitions,he had -with the Clyde Workers&apos; Committee. In that case theGovernment had satisfied themselves that they could stand a strike of six weeks on the Clyde. Ultimately, industrial peace was secured by deporting several of the leaders and prosecuting others. that policy destroyed the nerve of the Shop Steward movement, andGlasgow has been comparatively quiet since. It was most desirablethat the bulb of the workers should be on the side of the State, andthat no provocative action should throw them into the oppositecamp. He was of opitiion that it was somewhat soon to take thethe step suggested by the Minister of Munitions. In the meantimeit could be ascertained who were the leaders who were fomentingthe strike, and if a little time were given for the strike to develop,it might be found that the workmen themselves would fall intohostile groups. There was no question of the Government going backon its announced policy, but only of deciding the precise moment atwhich to make a counter-offensive.Sir David Shackleton urged that inasmuch as the proposal wasto make a public declaration of a new policy, namely, that a strikemight lead directly to the military conscription of the strikers, it was most desirable that the Minister of Munitions should consult inadvance the Trade Union Advisory Committee. The opportunityfor such consultation had been promised by the Minister of Munitionssoon after he assumed office, and a similar policy had been followedby the Minister of National Service. As the strike was a legal onethe Trade Union funds would be liable, and it should not be open tothe leaders to say that the Government had taken the serious stepproposed without conferring with the accredited leaders of the men.In previous trade disputes it had been understood if the men returnedto work, their position in regard to the recruiting machine was neither helped nor hindered.Sir Auckland geddes said it was important in any declarationof policy to make clear the distinction between a trade dispute on an
economic issue, and the present strike against the State.   Such a distinction could be put to the Advisory Committee, and the notice I might then be issued immediately to the press.Mr. Churchill reminded the Cabinet that the strikers were Icalculating on the Government being afraid to have recourse openly f.to the Military Service Acts.   In view of the course the discussion phad taken with reference to the  Advisory Committee, he was Eprepared to meet the Committee and to announce to them the policy Iof the Government.   He would then invite them to endeavour to Isettle the dispute, which was a strike against them as much as jagainst the State.   They could assume the role of standing betweenthe Government and labour, and could point out to the men that,unless the embargo scheme were allowed to operate, the Government Iwould have no alternative but to withdraw the exemptions from military service of the men on strike.Mr Roberts said that his objections were met by Mr. Churchill&apos;slast suggestion, and Mr. Hodge concurred.Mr. Barnes said that he was in favour of some decisive action being taken,by the Government which would bring to the side ofthe Government the men who were wavering. He also called attention to the unrest which prevailed because the Government, inthe opinion of the men, had failed to give statutory effect to itspledges to restore Trade Union conditions after the war.The War Cabinet decided That the Minister of Munitions should meet the TradeUnion Advisory Committee and announce to them thej)policy of the Government. He should then make tothem the proposal that they should endeavour to settle the strike themselves, otherwise the Government wouldhave no alternative but to put its policy into operation.In his statement to the Committee, the Minister should emphasise the distinction between the present challenge to the State and an ordinary trade dispute: the formerinvolving a form of procedure quite inapplicable to thelatter. Finally, he should point out the difficulty of recruiting elderly men, agricultural labourers, &amp;c, inorder to maintain the essential needs of the army, whenyoung men exempted from military service to do workfor the State refused to work at all.12. With reference to the letter from the Hon. A. Stanley to thePrime Minister relative to the appointment of a Minister of Prisoners(G.T.-5152), Mr. Bonar Law stated that Mr. Macpherson. Under-Secretary of State for War, had informed, him that the War office was putting forward a paper on the subject of prisoners in general.Lord Milner confirmed this, andThe War Cabinet decided That the consideration of the question of co-ordinating all workrelating to prisoners of war, both in enemy countries andin this country, should be deferred until after the receiptof the report from the War Office.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 24, 1918.o
