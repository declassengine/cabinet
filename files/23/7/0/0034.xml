The Czeoho- 1. THE Prime Minister drew the attention of the War Cabinetblovak Forces. to a document prepared by the Foreign Office, which gave a verygraphic account of the march of the Czecho-Slovaks in Siberia. Hesaid that he thought the document should be published in the press.Lord Robert Cecil undertook to look into the matter and havethe document edited with a view to its publication.The War Cabinet decided that A message should be sent to the Czecho-Slovak national council in Paris, congratulating them on the victories ofthe Czecho-Slovak forces in Siberia.FTonTeStern 2- The ]DireGtor of Military Intelligence stated that there was&quot;1 u   &apos; nothing to   report on the Western front beyond   several   smalladvances which had been reported in that morning&apos;s telegrams. Hesaid that 105 German divisions had been employed on the Scarpe-Aisne front. The Germans had used, in all, 144 divisions, 39 ofwhich had been put into the fighting line on more than one occasion. General Macdonogh said that the reduction in the strengthof the German divisions was continuing. In 22 divisions they hadreduced the number of their companies from 4 to 3. The numberof German divisions had also been reduced by 15. Out of a total of228 divisions in the whole German army, 193 were on the western front. The maximum number of divisions the Germans had everpossessed was 242German Moral.] 3 The   Director of Military Intelligence  read to the WarCabinet an extract from a captured order of the 234th Division,dated the 3rd August, 1918. This Divisional Order of the Day gave the findings of courts-martial in seventeen serious cases, whereconvictions were adjudged under seven heads, as follows: (1.) Desertion on active service.(2.) Conspiracy to desert.(30 Cowardice.(4.) Unauthorised absence from fear of personal danger.I 5.) Express disobedience to orders. i(6.) Attempted self-mutilation.(7.) Looting during the retreat.For this number of convictions to appear in a Divisional order for one day was significant.German Reserves. 4. The Director of Military Intelligence stated that there were signs that portions of the 1920 class was now out of Germany, andwere being trained in the Field Dep6ts behind the line. Up to thepresent none of this Class had appeared in the fighting line.Vladivostock.i 5. The Director of Military Intelligence read to the WarCabinet two telegrams from one of his agents at Vladivostock(No. 47, dated the 8th September, 1918, and No. 48, of the same date). These telegrams stated that General Dietrichs had resigned,and that Colonel Kadlis, the commander of the 7th Regiment, would succeed him in command of the 2nd Division. General Dietrichs&apos;resignation irom the Czech command was absolutely voluntary, as he considered that it was now his duty to place his services at thedisposal of the Allies in Vladivostock, and to work with them with aview to the reconstruction of a Russian military force. the telegrams proceeded that the forces under Haida in the Oliviania
district were composed of three battalions of the 5th Regiment andtwo battalions of the 6th Regiment, between 4,000 and 5,000 strongin all. Besides these, there were units of the Siberian army. It wasimpossible at present even roughly to estimate the number of troops at the disposal of the Siberian Government. It was known that acadre of officers existed sufficient for the formation of five corpsdistricts, three of these being already formed, with centres at Omsk,Tomsk, and Irkutsk. The two other   were to be the Amur and theUral. In the existing three districts the 1919 and 1920 classes hadbeen called up. General Seminoff had been appointed Chief of theAmur district, and would endeavour to raise one cavalry division andone or two infantry divisions. The telegrams concluded by sayingthat General Dietrichs was somewhat doubtful of the success of thenew Russian formations. He considered that all Czech troopspreviously in Vladivostock (about 12,000 men) and all the allied troops should be sent to the Volga as soon as possible. The strengthof the enemy in this district was about 80,000 strong. This force was at present opposed by the 1st Division of Czechs and a Czech forma-tion recently sent west, about 40,000 men in all. There was also a russian national army, about 60,000 strong, which was largelycomposed of peasants.Trans-Caucasia. 6. The Director of Military Intelligence said that the situation at Baku was still uncertain. We had received information thatour Staff were directing operations from on board ship. The Turkswere said to be in control of the oilfields and biding their time beforeattacking the town.East Africa. 7, The Director of Military Intelligence explained the situationin East Africa, with the aid of a map.   He stated that General VonLettow&apos;s force was endeavouring to break northwards into German&apos; East Africa, and that General Van Deventer was despatching troopsin various directions with a view to preventing this.SubmarinesThe Steamship&quot; Persic.&quot;8. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that the steamship&quot; Persic,&quot; with troops on board, -was torpedoed on the afternoon ofthe 7th instant, in a position about 40 miles from Bishop&apos;s RockLighthouse and had reached harbour. It was reported that the sub-marine had been destroyed by the escort.   There were no casualties.H.M.S. &quot; Nessus.&quot;9. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that H.M.S. &quot; Anrphi-trite&quot; and the destroyer &quot;Nessus&quot; had collided on returning fromoperations in the North Sea. H.M.S. &quot; Nessus &quot; foundered on the morning of the 8th instant while being towed to port. There were no casualties.SubmarineAttacks on largeVessels.10. The First Lord of the Admiralty stated that an interestingfeature of the submarine situation was that the Germans were now^ncentratmg their .attacks on cjuF larger stnps^a-nd our losses&amp;-4ala^goF-vosaolahad gond&apos;1 up&apos; 8&quot; por &quot;oonfcjbin the-daist-dHrrree-^aaeftths. ^Another interesting feature was that the America-United Kingdom &apos;traffic route was now safer than the Franco-America traffic route.The losses on the latter route had increased during the last four months. The First Lord thought that the decrease in the numberof attacks on the America-U nited Kingdom route was possibly dueto the better organisation of our routeing.
The Prime Minister said that he would like to know what per-centage of troops escorted by British ships had been lost at sea.The Deputy First Sea Lord undertook to furnish the Prime. Minister with these figures.Strength of theBritish Army inFrance.11. The Prime Minister said that suggestions had repeatedlybeen made that the Government had not carried out its duty insupplying the British army with reinforcements, and a complaint ofthat character had appeared in the &quot; Daily Chronicle &quot; that morning.He had received detailed figures from the War Office on this matter,and thought it might be necessary to publish them. He was of theopinion that the public did not realise the magnitude of our effort inthis direction. Last year, including Dominions and Labour units,we had sent to France 1,276,000 men. Of this number 874,000were fighting troops. Between the 1st January and the 21stMarch, 1918, we had sent to France 167,000 fighting men, and sincethe latter date we had despatched 535,000 fighting men ; so that since January 1917, 1,576,000 fighting men had been sent to France.A grand total of 2,000,000 men had been sent to Field-Marshal sir douglas Haig&apos;s forces. The Prime Minister thought that noEuropean army could show figures anything like these.It was stated that criticism of the Government in this matter was to the effect that we had not sent troops until after the 21stMarch, when large numbers were rushed across.The Prime Minister said, however, that the troops raised sincethe 21st March were only just becoming available ; the Governmenthad raised the troops, and it was a question of distribution for theGeneral Staff to settle whether the men should be in France or inEngland.Some doubt was expressed as to whether the figures quoted bythe Prime Minister included returned wounded or not.Lord Milner stated that returned wounded were included in thefigures supplied to the Prime Minister. Since the 21st March largenumbers of men had been sent to France, drawn in part from menwho had been in training during the preceding four months, and inpart from Home Defence, from Egypt, and, indeed, from all possiblesources of supply.The War Cabinet agreed that It would be advantageous to publish the figures, in order thatthe people at home and our Allies should have a clearerconception of the magnitude of our effort.The CottonSituation.12. With reference to War Cabinet 347, Minute6,Sir H. LlewellynSmith explained to the War Cabinet the situation in regard to&apos; the threatened strike in the cotton trade. This situation had arisenowing to the spinners, against the advice of their own leaders,refusing to abide by the decision of the Cotton Control Board. Itshould be understood that the Cotton Control Board represents all sections of employers and operatives in the cotton industry, and hasalso as its members two commercial representatives and one repre-sentative of the Board of Trade. The Control Board was set up inorder to ration the trade when cotton supplies became restricted,, inorder to minimise the inequalities of supply among the mills. Forthis purpose power was taken to limit the amount of machinery which might be worked in any cotton mill. Mills on government work or using Egyptian cotton could use further machinery on payment of a levy based on the amount of excess machineryused, and the proceeds of this levy went to provide for payment to those operatives who became unemployed by reason of the policyof the   Board.    By means of this  levy unemployment benefit
had been paid varying from 15s. to 25s. a week according to family.This system worked very well at the start, but difficulties arose asthe cotton situation got worse.The &quot; Rota&quot; system, which was popular with the operatives,involved a great waste of man-power, and with a further reductionin the supplies of cotton it became evident that it was hopeless to expect operatives only unemployed for one week in four, and drawingperhaps lZ. or more for that week, to accept work elsewhere, and aposition had now been reached that there were mills on Govern-meut w^ork unable to !get sufficient labour, while the drain onthe unemployment fund was far greater than it ought to be. TheCotton Control Board, therefore, unanimously, came to the conclusionthat this system must be abolished, but, under pressure from the rank and file of the operatives, their leaders went back on this agree-ment. The operatives appealed to the President of the Board ofTrade, who met the difficulty at that time by obtaining more cotton,which enabled the Cotton Control Board to increase the numberof hours worked from forty to forty-five and a-half hours, thepercentage of machinery worked from 50 to 55, and the rateof. unemployment benefit by one-fifth, and all operative leaderson the Board agreed to recommend this to their members. All the operatives accepted the proposals, with the exception of the spinners,who, against the advice of their leaders, threatened to strike. If astrike took place undoubtedly the effect on war production would be serious, particularly with regard to aircraft, if it extended to the spinners of Egyptian cotton.The spinners appeared to attach less importance to the &quot; Rota &quot;system than to obtaining unemployment benefit for the hours bywhich their employment is curtailed.If the decision of the Control Board were upset he anticipatedthat they would resign, and it would not be possible to replace themby another representative Board. Either, therefore, the whole levysystem would disappear, or it would have to be administered bureau-cratically, a very difficult task in Lancashire.The Minister of Labour said that he had carefully consideredevery aspect of the problem, in order to avoid a strike, if possible.The official leaders had, however, been thrown over by the rank and file, led by the shop stewards, and they were very anxious that theGovernment should take a firm stand, so that their authority might be re-established, as they are members of the CottonControl Board, which had agreed to the abolition of the &quot; Rota&quot;system.Sir David Shackleton explained that the contention of the operatives was that, while employers were making more money thanthey had ever done before, they (the operatives) would be forced bythe present proposal to live on an 18 per cent, increase of wages,when the increased cost.of living was about 100 per cent. It wasimpossible to arbitrate under the Act. The real position was thatthe weavers and overlookers, who comprised two-thirds of the totalcotton operatives, had only accepted the abolition of the &quot;Rota&quot;system and the consequent changes by a majority of one, and hadnot taken a ballot on the question. On the other hand, the spinnershad taken a ballot under their constitution, and as a result 81 &quot;9 percent, had voted in favour of a strike, the percentage required before a strike could take place being 80 per cent. The leaders were quiteloyal, and anxious to carry out the agreement, but the difficulty ofthe situation was that the only people who could be prosecutedunder the Defence of the Realm Act were the leaders, so that theywere now placed in the position that they must either disobey thelaw or the constitutional result of the-ballot.Mr. Chapman advised issuing an injunction prohibiting the payment of strike pay. It was hoped that the effect ofthis would probably be that the strike would collapse. If,however, the men stood out, the whole industry would undoubtedly
be stopped, and about 350,000 eventually be thrown out ofwork, although the dispute only directly affected some 20,000or more. There was a fair chance of stopping the strike ifthe leaders were supported, but if they were not, there was aprobability of the Cotton Control Board coming to an end. Thepeople who wanted the strike were the shop stewards, but it was doubtful if they would be supported by the operatives if no strikepay was forthcoming. The spinners were demanding to be paid bythe Cotton Control Board for lost time between working hours aweek and the 55 hours originally allowed. If, however, this was paid, a very large question would be raised, as it was possible that,owing to the shortage of coal, there would be short time in many other industries. Any such claim should be made to the employers,but it was not possible for the men to do this just now, as the agreement with the employers by which they were now bound did not come to an end until the 7th December.Questioned as to whether steps had been taken in regard tothe issue of an injunction to stop strike pay by the Trades Union,Mr. Roberts said that the opinion of the Law Officers of theCrown was now being taken. Notices had already been given ofthis step, and it would be publicly announced, probably on Fridaynext.The opinion was expressed that, if the operatives expressed the wish to go to arbitration, it would not be possible, in spite of thedifficulties, to refuse to do so.It was also suggested that a correct statement of the factsshould be published in the &quot; Manchester Guardian,&quot; and emphasislaid on the fact that the agreement against which the spinners werestriking was an agreement arrived at by the Cotton Control Board,which represented the Operatives&apos; Associations.13. The AVar Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the Minister of Munitions (Paper G.T.-5624) and a Memorandumby the Admiralty (Paper G.T.-56-44) on the subject of the return to civil life of men urgently required by those Departments.In his Memorandum, Mr. Churchill asked for War cabinet authority for :  &apos;(a.) The immediate return to civil life of 400 men born in theyears 1898 and 1 899 employed in blast furnaces, stampingand forging.(b.) An additional bulk release from the army and air force of300 men formerly employed in these industries.The Admiralty memorandum requested authority for the returnto civil life of: (a.) 200 men for the making of scientific instruments.(b.) 400 skilled men for the supply of A.P.C. shell and themaking of gun-mountings and breech mechanisms,(c) 235 men for the production of gun and barbed wire.The Deputy Minister of Munitions said that, in addition to themen asked for in the memorandum put forward by Mr. Churchill,another 400 men were urgently required for the industries named,making a total of 1,100.The War Cabinet approved of the withdrawal from the servicesof the men asked for by the Ministry of Munitions and theAdmiralty, the necessary arrangements being made by theMinister of National Service with the Departmentsconcerned.M.an-power:Return, to civil life of Men forthe Ministry ofMunitions and theAdmiralty.
accommodation for the ForeignOffice and department of overseas Trade.14. With reference to War Cabinet 456, Minute 11, lord robert Cecil raised the question as to additional accommodation forthe Foreign Office and the Department of Overseas Trade. He saidthat the War Priorities Committee did not see their way to givingpermission for the necessary labour to be diverted in order to erect a building outside the Foreign Office, on the Horse Guards&apos; Parade.General Smuts said that it would be impossible to get thenecessary labour for this work, and the War Priorities Committeehad recently passed a resolution that no new work should be com-menced unless it directly affected the winning of the war.Lord Robert Cecil then made a suggestion that the Admiralty,who now occupied one of the new Office of Works buildings inGreat George Street, should be removed to one or more private houses in Carlton House Terrace, which could be requisitioned for thepurpose, in order to furnish the extra accommodation needed by theForeign Office.The War Cabinet requested General Smuts to examine and decide the matter, in consultationwith the Departments concerned.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.,September 10, 1918.
