The Western Front. 1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that General Byng&apos;s army had attached that morning on a front of between 10 and 12 miles, and, according to telephoniccommunication received from France, was meeting with very little opposition. General Wilson hoped to receive further particidarsof this attach later in the day. - *!The Enemy&apos;intentions.Austrian Divisions.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the intentions of the enemy at the present moment were a little difficult&quot;TxTTathom, ancThe thought that the^ hb^r^ssi^b-v4ileh--the--%lai- ojG^Mnetrrm^^3rrrfed some days ago, that the Amiens advance might involve us in a second Passcnendaele^shou-ld--now-be-eorreeted-. In SJthe operations which Marshal Foch was now undertaking he had no intention of involving himself in a battle which would result in heavy casualties ; he intended only to advance as far as he could with as little loss as possible. If the French advance of the previous day was accomplished with nothing but their front line troops which was the case as far as General Wilson&apos;s information went the theory might be put forward that the Germans did not wish toput up a fight, but intended to fall back to some line in rear. Thistheory, however, could not be supported when one remembered thatthe French had taken 8,000 prisoners. It was possible that theGermans desired to put water between our forces and theirs, inorder to hamper the work of our tanks. In this case the germans would probably go back to the River Ailette in front of the French,and back to the Somme in front of the British.General Smuts said that the present, attitude of the Germansbore out what he had been told at General Headquarters some time ago, that the German divisions in the line were not capable of abig military effort, and that their good divisions were resting.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said, however, thatgood German divisions had been in the line, and Prince Rupprecht&apos;sreserve was now reduced from thirty-five to eight divisions.General Smuts said there was a possibility that the Germansintended to fall back to their old Hindenburg line, as the area theywould have to evacuate was of no importance. Nevertheless, if thiswas the German intention, it &quot;was difficult to understand why theywere not conducting the retreat in an orderly manner and should allow so many prisoners to be captured.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, according to german orders which had been captured, there was no doubt thatthe enemy&apos;s discipline was becoming very shaky. There had beena good deal of looting in the rear, aud the continued disobedienceto orders was causing the German Higher Command considerable anxiety. He would not go so far as to say, however, that completedemoralisation had set in, but he wished the Cabinet to realise thatwe were now confronted with a different situation from that whichhad obtained at Passchendaele.General Wilson then informed the War Cabinet of the possiblepositions to which the Germans might withdraw. He thought it unlikely that they would evacuate Lille, but would prefer to use thattown as a pivot. If the Germans withdrew to the old Hindenburgline, they would save thirteen divisions ; if they fell back to a line between Lille and Rheims, they would save twenty-two divisions.The shortest line of all for the Germans to fall back upon would be,of course, the River Meuse. This would effect a saving of, possibly,fifty or sixty divisions.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that another factor in the situation was the discovery of one, or perhaps two or three,Austrian divisions in the line. The French, although they had not actually captured Austrian prisoners, had picked up Austrian equip-
merit of a division near the apex of the St. Mihiel salient. Thisshowed (1) that the enemy was very hard pressed for men, and(2) that the Germans had probably given up any idea of attackingItaly. In answer to a question, General Wilson said that there were no signs of German divisions being sent to Italy to replace theAustrian divisions.Shortage of Enemy Further evidence of the German shortage of man-power wasMan-Power. disclosed by the fact that they were bringing a number of Germanwomen into Belgium to do the work of men in their auxiliary ser-vices, and in one area alone 15,000 women were being brought in.German Forces in With regard to the German forces in Finland, the Chief of theFinland. Imperial General Staff said that, according to a despatch received that morning, the number of Germans in that country was lower than the estimate, but so far there had been no trace of Germanunits being moved from that country.The Czecho-Slovak 3. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to telegramForces. No. 122, dated the 19th August, 1918, from Vladivostock, and atelegram to the War Office, No. 28, dated the 19th August, 1918,with regard to the situation of the Ozecho-Slovak forces, and thedesire expressed by the Japanese to increase their force by 0,000 or7,000 men.Lord Curzon said that the position of the Czecho-Slovak forces was more than precarious, and that the refusal of President Wilsonto allow the Japanese to increase their force threw upon him a verygreat moral responsibilily if the Czecho-Slovaks were exterminated.Mr. Chamberlain suggested that the gist of the two telegramsmentioned above should be telegraphed to Marshal Foch, and thatthe Marshal should communicate with President Wilson, urging therelief of this force, and emphasising the important bearing it wouldhave on the present operations on the Western front if the Germananxieties in the East were increased.Lord Robert Cecil said that he thought any attempt to bringfurther pressure to bear on President Wilson with regard to thissubject might produce an opposite result to that which we desired.The President was well aware of the British Governments views onthis matter, but his policy was not ours ; he did not believe in thepossibility of reconstituting the Eastern front, and it wras a principleof President Wilson&apos;s not to intervene in the internal affairs of any country unless requested to do so by the inhabitants. Lord Robert- Cecil was, however, telegraphing that day to the Japanese and tothe Czecho-Slovaks. He thought that if the Czecho-Slovaks them-selves appealed direct to President Wilson it might have more effect.In addition, all the telegrams received by the Foreign Office on thissubject were repeated in full to Washington for the Presidentsinformation.It wras suggested that the present moment was particularlyappropriate for Marshal Foch to place his views before PresidentWilson, in view of the present situation on the Western front, and marshal Foch might state that, unless the Czecho-Slovak forces wererelieved, his campaign in the West would be ruined.The War Cabinet decided that Lord Robert Cecil should consult Lord Reading as to thefollowing courses : (a.) To forward to President Wilson the two telegramsmentioned above, without comment;(6.) To accompany the two telegrams by a statement that we did not Avish to put further pressure onthe President, whose views we respected eventhough wre did not share them, but that we felt bound to communicate to him this information ;
(c.) The desirability of moving Marshal Foch to make aseparate communication, in which case the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff should take thenecessary action.Lord Robert Cecil was empowered to initiate such action ashe might agree with Lord Reading.Belgium BeliefShip Torpedoed.4. The First Sea Lord reported that a Belgian Relief ship hadbeen torpedoed on the afternoon of the 20th August, off theNorwegian coast. He had not received full information with regardto this incident, but it was possible that this ship had been sunkinside territorial waters.Submarines5. The First Sea Lord stated that confirmation had beenreceived of the sinking of an enemy submarine on the 18th instant..norwegian territorial Waters.6. With reference to War Cabinet 460, Minute 11, the first sea Lord stated that one of our submarines had observed an enemy submarine passing through Norwegian territorial waters.In this connection Mr. Chamberlain drew attention to Sir M.Fincllay&apos;s telegram No. 2874 IC, of the 18th instant, whichemphasised the importance of keeping the United States of Americain line with us in any action we might take in this matter. he attached great weight to the following passage, paraphrased fromSir M. Findlay&apos;s telegram : &quot; That the United States should participate in the hintthat the Allies would be forced to act themselves unless Norwayeither acted or allowed us to do so, and that the United states should share in such action if it were taken.&quot;Mr. Chamberlain thought that it was of the first importancepolitically that United States forces should be engaged in any mine-laying operations we might undertake in Norwegian territorial waters.The First Sea Lord said he thought that this could be done.Lord Robert Cecil stated that he had telegraphed to the AlliedCapitals asking for their support in this matter, but so far he hadreceived no reply.Belease beforeGeneralDemobilisation of&quot; Pivotal&quot; Men.7. With reference to War Cabinet 274, Minute 14, the WarCabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for War on the subject of the release, before generaldemobilisation, of &quot; demobilisers &quot; or &quot;pivotal &quot; men.The Secretary of State for War explained that the reconstruction committee on Army Demobilisation had recommended that special arrangements should be made with the War Office by the Ministryof Labour, before the end of the war, if possible, for priority indemobilising, immediately peace is assured, &quot;pivotal&quot; men, and pointed out that if such a scheme was adopted steps must be taken as soon as possible to set up, where it did not now exist, machineryfor selecting industries to be recognised as entitled to claim such men, and for earmarking the individuals to be released accordingly.Such a scheme must necessarity entail reference by the Ministry ofLabour to representatives of many industries, and would involve acertain amount of unavoidable publicity. Lord Milner did not putforward any objections to the scheme, but said that he consideredWar Cabinet sanction must be obtained before any further steps were taken.
8. The AVar Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary(Paper G.T.-545S) (Appendix), asking for the War Cabinet&apos;instructions in respect of the circulation of papers to the PrimeMinisters of the Dominions, between the sessions of the imperial war Cabinet, and also to the resident or visiting Ministers of theDominions nominated by the Prime Ministers as their representa-.tives at the Imperial War Cabinet when the Prime Ministers them-selves are not sitting.Circulation of WarCabinet Papers to prime Ministers ofthe Dominionsand theirRepresentatives inGreat Britain.The Minister of Labour said that the necessary work would bedone in consultation with the various Departments concerned. Anumber of men were required in many industries in order to restartthem, and men were also required in Government Departments inorder to carry out the demobilisation scheme. Mr. Roberts urgedthat the names of &quot;pivotal&quot; men required in the industries shouldbe selected now, so that there should not be, on demobilisation, anyindustrial chaos, which, in his opinion, would otherwise occur.General Smuts expressed the view that to carry tbis scheme into effect would have very dangerous results. Already, owing to recent victories on the Western front, a &quot;peace atmosphere&quot; hadbeen created, and to select men by name to be released on demobil-isation would, in his opinion, aggravate an already dangerousposition.The Deputy Minister of Munitions stated that the numbers to be released would be very large, and would run into many thousands. His Department would be able to carry the scheme into effect by means of the Labour Department of the Ministryof Munitions working in conjunction with the Advisory Com-mittee and the Trades Unions concerned. General Seelybrought to the notice of the AVar Cabinet the views of Sir J.Stevenson, who took the opposite view to the majority of the munitions Council, which was in favour of the scheme, and saidthat Sir J. Stevenson thought it was most inadvisable and unnecessary. Sir J. Stevenson had expressed the opinion thatthere would be sufficient time to demobilise the necessary&quot; pivotal&quot; men when the Peace Conference sat, and that theadoption of the scheme at the present time would create greatdisturbances in the labour world.It was pointed out that the AVar Cabinet had already approvedof the general principles laid down in the Second Interim Reportof the Committee on the Demobilisation of the Army (AArarCabinet L&apos;74, Minute 14), but the opinion was generally expressed that if the scheme was adopted many difficulties would be created.Mr. Chamberlain urged that the Dominion representatives fely strongly that their troops had a claim to early demobilisation, that every industry would consider if it would be able to obtain menunder this scheme, that the gravest labour difficulties would be caused far in advance of the time when peace was assured, eitherif men, or even numbers, were selected, and that the militaryauthorities had always expressed the opinion very strongly thatBritish stores and supplies could never be returned to Englandunless the Army abroad was demobilised by units.The President of the Board of Trade was not in favour of theproposals, and said that, whatever system was adopted, it was certain that many men selected as &quot; pivotal&quot; men for certain industries would find employment elsewhere.The AVar Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for War should bring this question upfor the further consideration of the AVar Cabinet in threemonths&apos; time.
The War Cabinet decided that Papers shoidd not be sent to Prime Ministers&apos; representatives in this country, but that important papers pertinent to thebusiness of the Imperial War Cabinet should be forwarded to the Prime Ministers, the selection to be left to theSecretary&apos;s discretion, subject to reference to the WarCabinet when necessary, and instructed the Secretary totake the necessary action.(Initialled) A.

APPENDIX.G.T.-5458. -Circulation of Papers to the Prime Ministers of the Dominions and to theirRepresentatives in this Country.Note by the Secretary.I ENCLOSE, for the information of the War Cabinet, a copy of a letter which sir Robert borden has written to the Prime Minister on the subject of the circulation of papers to the Prime Ministers of the Dominions between the meetings of the imperial war Cabinet. I should be glad to receive the instructions of the War Cabinet on thismatter, and I should like to raise, at the same time, the question of the papers to besent to the resident or visiting Ministers of the Dominions nominated by the PrimeMinisters as their representatives at the Imperial War Cabinet when the PrimeMinisters themselves are not present.It is not a very easy matter for this Office to decide exactly which papers are worth sending to the Prime Ministers of the Dominions. The course I would recommend for the consideration of the War Cabinet is that copies of all papers, otherthan those of purely domestic interest in the United Kingdom, excepting papers of extreme secrecy, the ciicuiation of which is usually confined within the narrowestpossible limits, should be sent to the representative Ministers on the Imperial WarCabinet in London, and that they should be asked to select those papers which theyconsider should be sent to the Prime Minister of their Dominion. To illustrate how this would work in practice, all papers, other than the two categories mentioned, wouldbe sent to Sir E. Kemp, and he would be asked to notify me of those which he thinksshould go to Sir Robert Borden. ,I would propose to meet the case of those Dominions who have no nominatedrepresentative Minister by detailing an officer in my office to submit to me the list of papers to be sent.A further question arises in this connection. Should the resident or visitingMinisters in London receive copies of the Foreign Office and War Office telegrams which have during the last few weeks been sent to the Prime Ministers of theDominions in London ? This is a matter which concerns the Foreign Office and WarOffice rather than this office, but it is so closely connected with the general question that I venture to raise it in this note.(Signed) M. P. A. HANKEY, Secretary.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,August 20, 1918.Enclosure to G.T.-5458.Offices of the War Cabinet, 2, Whitehall Garden, S.W.,Dear Mr. Lloyd George, August 16, 1918.. IT seems very desirable that some arrangement should be made whereby, duringthe interval between the sessions of the Imperial War Cabinet, important papers whichare circulated throughout the year to the members of the British War Cabinet couldbe sent out to the Dominions for the information of the Dominion members. It is an almost impossible task on our arrival here to give careful attention to the mass of documents which we find confronting us. Some of the papers could doubtless be sent out in the regular bag which goes from here to Ottawa ; as to others, it would probablybe necessary to arrange for a special messenger service. This, I should think, wouldnot be difficult.For myself, 1 should like to see all the important papers, and especially, perhaps,those relating to the United States of America, her forces and her war effort generally,the Siberian expedition, and Russia generally, and the League of Nations. I do not,however, in mentioning these special matters wish to be understood as in any senseexcluding other subjects.The arrangement would seem to be a natural consequence of the decision recentlyreached in the Imperial War Cabinet.Yours faithfully,(Signed) R. L. BORDEN.
