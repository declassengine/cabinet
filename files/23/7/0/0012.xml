Western Front. 1. IN continuation of Imperial War Cabinet 25, Minute 1, theChief of the Imperial General Staff informed the War Cabinet thaton the battle front east and west of Rheims 28 divisions had nowbeen identified, 7 of which had come from Prince Rupprecht&apos;s army.French Offensive. 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet - that yesterday morning the French had attacked with22 divisions between the Marne and the Aisne in an easterly direc-tion, and had on a 40-kilometre front considerably progressed, theextreme depth being 10 kilometres. Tanks took part in the initial stages of the action. The French claimed to have taken 16,000prisoners and, according to unofficial information, approximately100 guns.General Wilson stated that so far as he was aware the attack was still being pressed. One of the most important results of thiscounter-attack by the French might be the effect it might have onthe railway communications of the Germans in that area. Asregards the German offensive east of Rheims, the Chief of theImperial General Staff stated that the French had lost Prunay.British Front. 3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that therewas nothing to report as regards the British and Noyon-Montdidierfront. In reply to a question as to the likelihood of an attack onthe British army in the light of latest information, the Chief of theImperial General Staff stated that General Headquarters still held that our front was likely to be atacked by a force of 16 to 18 divisions in addition to those holding the line on the front of attack,and reported that it was possible that another corps headquartershad been established by the Germans at Bailleul. He was of opinionthat the German attack on the Marne was carried out with theintention of drawing down the Allied reserves in the north, after which a heavy attack would be put in by the enemy in that quarter.In this connection a telegram from General Petain&apos;s headquarterswas read, which confirmed this view. Asked by the Prime Ministerto furnish the War Cabinet with an appreciation of the situation, asviewed through German spectacles, the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff stated that the enemy might argue as follows : &quot; I made an attack on a big front with a few divisions soas to draw down to Rheims the bulk of the French reserves.This I have done, and I am therefore not dissatisfied with theresults. As regards the French counter-attack, I am pleasedwith it, and I am quite prepared to give up ground, provided atthe same time I draw into action the Allied reserves, and I am prepared to fight a rearguard action and then attack further north when it suits me. Of course, I should not like it if I was liable to be cut off, but the Crown Prince&apos;s reserves should besufficient to prevent any such success on the part of the enemy.&quot;General Wilson added that perhaps this was an extreme view.Macedonia. 4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that the French had moved forward in Albania.Trans-Caucasia. 5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that the Turks had advanced towards Baku and were now about 50 or 60 miles from that place.
Vladivostock: 6. The Deputy First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that.M.S. &quot;Suffolk.&quot; a telegram had been received from H.M.S. &quot;Suffolk&quot; that allsteamers in the Amur River had been taken over by the Bolsheviks,and that several of them had arrived at Nikolaievsk at the mouth ofthe River Amur. In view of this, the Japanese Admiral at vladivostock-vladivostock had telegraphed to Tokyo asking that destroyers mightimmediately be sent to watch the mouth of the Amur River.Admiral Hope explained that these vessels were shallow-draft ships and not of material importance.Heligoland Bight: 7. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that a force of lightAttack on Enemy     cruisers and coastal motor-boats had made a reconnaissance in the mine-sweepers.         Heligoland  Bight with the view to attacking the enemy mine-sweepers.   JSfo report giving details of the proceedings had yet beenreceived, but such information as had at present come to handindicated that we had probably lost one coastal motor-boat.Admiral Hope stated that H.M.S. &quot; Furious &quot; had also proceededyesterday to the Heligoland Bight with the view to despatching aero-planes to attack the airship sheds at Tondern. No report had yetbeen received of these operations.The First Lord explained that this was the first time thatwe had carried out such an attack on an enemy base from a fastaircraft carrier, and explained to the War Cabinet the method inwhich aeroplanes were used in this connection. He added that means had been taken to develop offensives of this type.H.M.S. &quot; Pellew.&quot; 8. The Deputy First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that.M.S. &quot;Pellew&quot; had been torpedoed by an enemy submarine 43 milesfrom Kinnaird Head whilst escorting a Scandinavian convoy, but was towed into harbour.   No casualties had been reported.Submarine &quot; E. 34.&quot; 9. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that submarine &quot; E. 34,&quot;wdiich had been engaged in mine-laying in the Heligoland Bight,had not returned.   It is feared that she is lost.Submarine &quot; D. 6.&quot; PO. With reference to War Cabinet 438, Minute 2, the deputy first Sea Lord stated that information had been received throughthe Red Cross that the captain of submarine &quot; D. 6 &quot; was a prisonerin Germany, which indicated the probability of our submarinehaving been sunk by one of the enemy sxibmarines.Spanish Territorial 11. The Deputy First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet thatWaters, a French steamer was reported to have been sunk by an enemy submarine in Spanish territorial waters in the vicinity of SanSebastian. From information received, it appears that the sub-marine, after sinking the vessel, endeavoured to hide her actions byramming two boats containing the survivors.Hospital Ships. 12. With reference to War Cabinet 441, Minute 7, the deputy first Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that a reply had beenreceived from the French Government that they were willing thathospital ships carrying Spanish officers should visit French ports.No answer, however, had yet been received from the United states on this subject.
American Convoy. 13. With reference to War Cabinet 447, Minute 4, the PrimeMinister informed the War Cabinet that he had received a message from the Shipping Controller relative to the decision of the WarCabinet as set out in the above-quoted minute, which was arrivedat in his absence. Sir Joseph Maclay had informed the secretary that, before the final decision was taken, he would like to lay hispoint of view before the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet decided that-The question of American convoys should be placed on theAgenda for Monday next, the 22nd instant, and directedthe Secretary to arrange for the attendance of the FirstLord of the Admiralty and the Shipping Controller onthat date.In the meanwhile it was agreed that the draft of the aboveminute should be modified so as to make the decisionprovisional.Mobilisation of 14. The   Prime   Minister   mentioned   that  he   had receivedGreece, information through sources connected with the Greek Governmentwith regard to the mobilisation of the Greek army, which left an impression that the mobilisation was being delayed because certain essential supplies, which had been promised by the BritishGovernment, had not been furnished. He wished to know if therewere any difficulties in the matter that could be cleared away.The Secretary of State for War drew attention to thememorandum (G.T.-5149) which he had circulated to the WarCabinet. The whole question had been settled months ago with theconsent of the Treasury. There was no question of asking theTreasury for anything not already sanctioned. What he objected towas that, after the sanction had been given, a new sanction shouldbe required for each item and every step fought over again. his proposal was that the articles promised to the Greek Government,with the consent of the Treasury, after they received further en-dorsement from the joint Treasury and War Office representative at athens (General Reade) should he despatched without againrequiring prior Treasury sanction in every instance.General Callwell pointed out that in the convention, to whichthe Treasury had agreed, we were bound to find the Greeks2,300,000 yards of cloth. As a matter of fact, General Reade had sofar only asked for 1,375,000 yards, and he (General Callwell) had had to apply to the Treasury again with regard to that. the delays which had occurred were due to those arising in obtainingTreasury sanction as well as to the actual difficulties of gettingmaterial. The Treasury delay was in addition to any other delays,and in some cases contracts could not be made until Treasurysanction was given.Sir Robert Chalmers said that the Treasury were only tooanxious to get through business expeditiously, and thought all thesematters could be settled speedily by personal meetings betweenparties concerned. In their opinion, the War Office were to blame for the delay and for arrogating financial functions outside their authority.The War Cabinet decided that-It was essential that the convention to which the BritishGovernment had already agreed for the equipment of theGreek army should be carried out without delay, and thatthe Departments concerned should arrange for an immediatemeeting to settle the matter and report to the WarCabinet.
Soldiers&apos; and sailors&apos; pay committee:Increase of separation Allow-ances.Allowances toParents ofUnmarriedApprentices.15- With reference to War Cabinet 435, Minute 10, the WarCabinet had under consideration the Sixth and Supplementary-Report of the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee, with a coveringnote by the Chairman (G.-217 and G.-217 (a.)) and a note by theMinister of Pensions on the subject of allowances to parents ofunmarried apprentices, students, and youths, on progressive wages(G.T.-5148).Mr. Barnes briefly outlined the recommendations of theCommittee. The Committee first dealt with the question of the wifewithout children. On this point there had been many questions inthe House of Commons, but the Committee, after full consideration,had decided, in view of the fact that a childless wife, if unable towork, received 4s. a week from the Special Grants Committee, andwas also assisted, if necessary, by the Civil Liabilities Committee,to recommend no increase, to the present rate of 12s. 6d. aweek. In dealing with the question of the wife with children,Mr. Barnes said that the Committee had had regard to the presentcost of living as compared with the cost of living at the last timewhen separation allowances were last adjusted. This increase of cost, as compared with 1915, was approximately 14 per cent., andthe Committee had recommended that a wife with one child shouldreceive 2s. 6d. extra a week, which was an increase of 12^- per cent.,and that a wife with two children should also receive 2s. extra forthe second child, making a total increase of 4s. 6d. per week, whichwas an increase of slightly under 18 per cent. As the Committeehad recommended that the children&apos;s allowances for a wife with notmore than two children should not be increased, the total amount of increase would approximately be 14 per cent, for all children&apos;allowances. The Committee had been unanimous in these proposals,but the Financial Secretary to the War Office had put in a MinorityReport (No. 2), which pointed out that the proposed increase would,in some cases, bring the separation allowance to a sum higher thanthe full wages the soldier was able to earn in civil life. In dealingwith the case of motherless children, the Committee recommendedthat the rate for motherless children under 14 years of age, for one child maintained in a home, should be increased from 7s. to 10s.,and that the rate for the second and subsequent motherless children should be increased from 6s. to 7s. The cost of these proposalsfor the Admiralty, War Office, and Royal Air Force was estimatedat 14,000,00OZ., and this estimate took into account the futureincrease in the personnel of the latter service. The most contro-versial question with which the Committee had to deal was that withregard to the parents of men serving. Mr. Barnes explained that the parent of a man who was conscripted who was able to prove evena small pre-war dependency, was entitled not only to separationallowance, but to consideration by the Special Grants Committee,whilst the parents of boys who had volunteered in the early days of the war, being unable to prove any pre-war dependency, gotnothing. The Committee recommended .that a minimum allowance of 3s.&apos; 6d\ a&apos;week as a flat rate should be paid to parents on application. In the first instance, it had been proposed that allcases should be dealt with on merit, but, after a long discussion, ithad been decided that this was impossible owing to administrative difficulties, and that, if cases were dealt with individually, therewould he at least twelve months&apos; delay in settling them, whichwould create considerable agitation. Mr. Barnes drew the attentionof the War Cabinet to the note by the Minister of Pensions(G.T.-5148), which proposed that the flat rate should be 5s. insteadof os. 6^., and explained that the Committee had adopted the sumof 3s. Qd., firstly, because people were more used to the sum of3s. 6d. ; and, secondly, because pensions depended largely on therate of separation allowances, and on the adoption of the largersum, the Government would be committed to largely increased expenditure. The total cost of the flat rate of 3s. (td. would be[1365-449] C
4,500,0001., and if extended to pensions, a further 2,200,000?., hmaking a total for all the proposals of the Committee of 20,700,000?.It was recommended that these proposals should come into force ou jthe first day in October, as the Departments concerned had strong]1urged that it would be impossible, for administrative reasons, tomake earlier payments.   Mr. Barnes also drew attention to a not eby the Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Minority Report No. 1) :  which protested against the flat rate of 3s. 6d., on the ground that insufficient evidence had been produced to justify this expenditure.The Minister of Pensions urged that there could not be any differences of opinion as to the strength of feeling on the subject of separation allowances to the parents of apprentices.   The apprentice J jwho volunteered in 1914 was undoubtedly treated unfairly as corn-pared   with   the   conscript   of    1916.     During   these   years, Iwages had risen and the latter   had been able to contribute  tothe  home,   with  the  result  that,   when, he  was   conscripted, -pre-enlistment dependency was proved.   Mr. Hodge expressed the belief that if the flat rate of 3s. 6cZ was approved, Local PensionsCommittees and the Special Grants Committee would be unable todeal with the numerous cases which would come before them for !review.    Already there was considerable dissatisfaction amongstmembers of Local Pensions Committees, who were all volunteers;the extra work from1; the Civil Liabilities Committee which local war Pensions Committees&apos; had recently had put upon their shoulderswas great, and if more work were added, they would undoubtedlyrebel.   In addition to this, Local Pensions Committees dealt with individual cases in a very unequal manner.   Some were very fair,   ibut some were grossly extravagant, and Mr. Hodge said that notonly was 5s. a fair rate in his opinion, but that the expenditure would not be much increased if this rate were granted, as therewould be fewer applications for consideration by Local Committees.From the point of view of parents&apos; pensions, Mr. Hodge also urged the adoption of the 5s. rate, believing it to be more just and lessexpensive in administration.Mr. Chamberlain stated that the question of apprentices&apos;allowances had come before the Select Committee when separation allowances were first dealt with, but that Committee had decidedthat it was only possible to deal with facts as they were at the timeof enlistment, for, if prospective wages were taken into considera-tion, it would be necessary to deal also with the question of allowances being withdrawn by the soldier, as was so often done on marriage and for other reasons.The Prime Minister said that, whichever way this question waslooked at, the War Cabinet had to take a decision of great import-ance, and that before he could make up his mind he would like toknow what the conditions were that prevailed in Canada, America, IAustralia, and other countries in dealing with this problem.Mr. Lloyd George expressed the opinion that this was the worst timefor Pensions Committees to decide  cases, in view of the fact that,with the possibility of a general election, labour representatives on local committees would be urging increased grants, while there was&quot;already one political party which had machinery in existence for that very purpose.The Financial Secretary to the Admiralty suggested that theWar Cabinet should settle the question of increased allowances for children, on which point the Committee was in entire agreementexcept for the dissenting note of the Financial Secretary to the War .Office, and he explained, by reference to Hansard, that no promiseon the question of parents&apos; allowances had been made in the Houseof Commons.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the absurdity of granting a flat rate to all parents would be that those, even if they    Iwere in possession of L001. or l,00OZ. a year, would be entitled tothis allowance on application.The Financial Secretary to the War Office, referring to the
Man-Power. 16 Witll reference to War Cabinet 439, Minute 6, the WarCabinet had a preliminary discussion as to the method of procedure to be adopted in dealing with large questions of man-power raised in the following memoranda : (a.) The  situation  for  the  second  half-year of  1918.G.T.-5127.   (Already circulated.)(b.) Munitions and the limits of recruiting.   G.T.-5114.(Already circulated.!(c.) Release of men born in years 1895, 1896, and 1897.G.T.-nl24.    (Already circulated.)(d.) Programme of development of the R. A. F.   G.T.-5096.(Already circulated.)(e.) General    aerial   policy.       G.T.-5076.       (already circulated.)The Prime Minister said that these memoranda involved thediscussion of some questions of policy of the first importance. Inthe first place, there was the question raised by the Minister ofMunitions with regard to pivotal men, to men engaged of 21, 22,and 23, and with regard to future releases of men from munition industries. In the second place, it was necessary to consider thepart that this country would take on the Western front and the partthat America would take next year, a matter closely connectedwith questions of our future war policy, which was now underconsideration by the Military Representatives at Versailles, by theGeneral Staff, and by a Committee of Prime Ministers set up byMinority Report which he had put forward, pointed out that the wifeof an agricultural labourer, even if the man now earned 30s. a week,would, if she had three children, under the present proposals, get32s. 6d. a week when the husband had been taken for the army andno longer had to be kept and fed. This would not matter so muchwhile the man remained a soldier, but there would be a very heavydrop when he returned to civil life.It was, however, pointed out that the real answer to this wasthat the man, when called up for military service, was liable to bekilled.A discussion arose as to the possibility of making children&apos;allowances payable before the 1st October, but it was pointed out thatas the half-yearly books only expired at the end of September, theadministrative difficulties were so great, that it would be impossibleto get the allowances paid at an earlier date, and it was generally agreed that it would be most undesirable to state publicly that theincreased allowances were granted from an earlier date than onwhich they could become payable.The War Cabinet decided that -(a.) The recommendations of the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; pay committee dealing with the increased allowances for children as put forward under the heading &quot; Wives andChildren &quot; in the Sixth and Supplementary Report ofthe Committee should be approved.(b.) The question of allowances to the parents of unmarriedapprentices, students, and youths on progressive wages should be remitted to the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; pay committee, and that, in submitting a further report onthis question for the consideration of the War Cabinet,the Committee should put forward a memorandumshowing the conditions under which this question isbeing dealt with in the colonies and Allied countries.(c.) That the Minister of Pensions should become an additionalmember of the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee.
the Imperial War Cabinet. In the third place, there was thevery urgent question of the utilisation of. our man-power. In thisconnection Mr. Lloyd George said that reports had been submittedfrom no less than four Departments, all of them expressing the opinion that our man-power was badly used in the Army.No less than three first-class experts, all of them great authorities on handling labour, had expressed the opinion that 60 per cent, ofthe labour now utilised in France could be dispensed with. Inaddition to this Mr. Lloyd George said, that representations hadbeen made to him by M. Clemenceau on this subject, and as aresult Colonel Roure, who was a French expert, had visited thiscountry, and had put forward criticisms on the same point. Mr.Lloyd George said that we could not continue taking men fromindustries and practically raising a mutiny in this country in the rural districts, and among the tribunals until we were convincedthat the best, use was being made of the men we had taken. Inview of the reports referred to above, it was clearly not established that that was being done with the 4,000,000 of men now serving,and consequently this question was one of primary importance andone which must he considered in the first instance. If anything wasto be done to put this matter right with regard to the army in France,nothing would be effected by means of a committee, but action must be taken by an individual. Mr. Lloyd George pointed out thatthe result, of the present offensive in France w*ould probably be known within a fortnight or three weeks, and that any action takennow, with regard to conscription, could have no effect on operations on the Western front this year.The Minister of Munitions said that it was really impossible for him to release more men from his Department, except slowly bydilution. As instance of the effect of releases already made, he mentioned that at the present time the output of aeroplane engineswas approximately 55 per cent, of the programme arranged, and theoutput of tanks had fallen by one-half. It was also impossible tomeet the requests of the War Office for breach mechanisms.Mr. Churchill said that his Department would, of course, go on and do the best it could under the circumstances, but he could not faceany further large withdrawal of labour. The vexation now in industries under his Department was very great. The men wereresisting dilution and delaying output, and there was considerablediscontent.The First Lord of the Admirahy urged that he had already put before the War Cabinet the views that Mr. Churchill had just,expressed, and entirely endorsed everything which had just been said.The Minister of National Service pointed out that at the begin-ning of the war the total available number of men up to the age of43 was 9,500,000; and of these 6,100,000 had been recruited. Thisalone gave an indication of the strain which had been put on thecountry. The physical standard of the men left was, broadly speaking, very low, and there were only available boys coming ofage or older men, who were difficult to get and not worth much.At the present time there was almost open resistance to the aclmini-stration of the Military Service Acts, and the position in this respecthad never been so bad except possibly during a few weeks at theend of 1917. Even if recruits were urgently necessary, Sir Auck-land Geddes said that they could not be got at the present time.Nearly 500,000 had been taken this year, and this result had been attained, not without a severe strain on industries, but withoutactually ruining them. Questioned as to the number of recruitscoming from Ireland, Sir Auckland said that they were practicallynegligible in quantity.The Minister of Labour said that the effect of the recent with-withdrawals had been very bad on the temper of labour. The labour market had been so depleted that the men who remained were
exercising undue power. The signs of unrest during the last fewweeks were very ominous.The Secretary of State for War, who was not present at theearlier part of the discussion, said that while he could not disputethe facts which were being brought forward, the War Cabinet mustrealise that the effect would be that the army next year woxrld be smaller than it was to-day. He admitted that there was some waste of man-power in the army, but even if an extreme view were taken,and there could be a saving of 100,000 in this direction, the differ-ence would not be made up. Moreover, credit should be given forthe considerable amount of combing effected in the army. We must now realise that we were passing from the time of enlisting 75,000men a month to 20,000, which meant passing from an army of bigto one of moderate dimensions.Mr. Lloyd George quoted the opinion of a very able regimentalofficer, which was to the effect that numbers of men could be easilyspared, even between brigade lines and the front trenches, and thiswas the opinion held by a large number of regimental officers. Itwould not do, either, to dismiss the statement which had been madeby the Germans, which was, that their numbers had been inferiorthis year to what ours had been on the Western front.Mr. Chamberlain said that the question which had in the past been put to the Army Council had never been answered namely,assuming that a choice had to be made between a considerable reduction of men in the army and a proportionate reduction in munitions and supplies, including those to our Allies, which would the War Office prefer ? The Adjutant-General of the day had always answered that they must have the men, while the Master-General of Ordnance and the Quarter-Master-General had said thatthey must have the supplies.Mr. Churchill suggested that it might be possible to utiliseIndian troops during the summer months on the Western front.Mr. Lloyd George said that all these memoranda now underconsideration were intimately bound up with other questions of vitalimportance which he had already referred to. Pending a decisionon these questions, he thought that no formal resolution could beadopted by the War Cabinet, but, in the meantime, it should be understood that the Minister of National Service must be alloweddiscretion as to how far, having regard to the man-power at his disposal, it was possible in the public interest to meet the totaldemands put forward by three fighting services.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 19, 1918.
