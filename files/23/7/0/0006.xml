The Western Front. l. THE  Chief of the Imperial General&apos; Staff reported that,beyond the customary raids, there was no news from the WesternGerman Divisions.French air reconnaissance.The Italian Front.front.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that therewere now 85 German divisions in reserve on the whole line of theWestern front, of: which GO were fresh divisions. Questioned as toany comparison which he could give with regard to the number of fresh divisions which were available at the time of the german offensive on the 21st March as compared with the present time,General Wilson undertook to give the necessary figures on thefollowing day, and to indicate also the possible extent of front onwhich an attack could now be made by the Germans, having regardto these figures.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theFrench air reconnaissance was unsatisfactory. It was impossible toobtain good reports, the photography was very erratic, and,consequently, indifferent comparisons were obtained. general wilson explained that this was very important, as no convincing evidence could be secured from such aerial reconnaissance withregard to impending or probable attacks.4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the Valonaoperations had been very satisfactory. The Italians had attackedroughly on a front of 50 miles, and had driven back the Austriansand Hungarians to an average depth of 6 or 7 miles. Not only had  ,000 prisoners been taken, but it was possible that the advancemight go still further. These operations made the position ofValona considerably safer, but, except from a point of view of moral,would have no effect on the Salon lea front.In this connection the Deputy First Sea Lord reported that.M.S. &quot; The Earl of Peterborough &quot; and H.M.S. &quot; Sir ThomasPictou,&quot; assisted the Italian forces by bombarding enemy works near1&apos; ieri, 17f- miles north of Valona, with satisfactory results. Inconjunction with the same offensive, British D.FI. 9 machinesbombed the enemy aerodrome at Tirana, whilst other machinesspotted for monitors and carried out bombing attacks on Kuchibridge,  whichwasreported to be completely destroyed.machine was reported missing and the officers prisoners,hostile scout was driven down.OneOneSubmarines.5. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that the trawler &quot; JohnFeltou,&quot; when patrolling south of the Needles on the -8th July,sighted a submarine submerging, and reported that a loud explosionoccurred one minute later. Two lines of mine-nets had been laid in the vicinity, and it is considered possible that the submarinemay have been damaged or destroyed.Admiral Plope further reported that the drifter &quot; NulliSecundus &quot; tired nine rounds from her-6-pr. at a submarine at point-blank range, off Flamborough Head. Six mines in nets close bywere seen to explode ; depth charges were dropped on oil rising tothe surface.H.M.S. &quot; Botha.&quot; g  The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that H.M.S. &quot;Botha&quot;had been mined 9y miles from Dover, but had returned safely toharbour.
Vladivostock. 8. With reference to Imperial War Cabinet 23, Minute 3, the deputy First Sea Lord said that a telegram had been received fromthe Commanding Officer of 1J.M.S. &quot; Suffolk &quot; reporting that, at an allied Conference held on the 7th July the General OfficerCommanding the Czech troops had given a description of the battle of Nikolsk. The Czechs had surrounded and captured an enemyforce consisting of 10 armed prisoners and 80 Reel Guards, sent toblow up a tunnel. The enemy in front of Nikolsk were about 2,500strong, with 6 guns, worked by Germans. After a two days&apos; battlethe remnant of the enemy escaped by train towards Haborovsk,blowing up bridges and railway effectives. The total Czechcasualties, were 3 officers and 40 men killed, with 6 officers and 220men wounded, whilst of the enemy 350 were found dead, the numberof wounded being unknown. The Czechs took 1,000 prisoners, ofwhich 600 were Magyars, all of which were brought to Vlaciivostock.The General Officer Commanding the Czech force had explained theserioiisness of the situation, and had pointed out that, taking intoconsideration the Czech garrison which lie was obliged to leave at vladivostock and Nikolsk and on lines of communications, histotal force for further advance would only number 8,000, and herequested that Vladivostock might be garrisoned by the Allies.The Commanding Officer of H.M.S. &quot;Suffolk1&apos; had said that all theAllied Commanders had agreed that an Expeditionary Force should be despatched immediately, and that they were informing their Govern-ments accordingly. He had also drawn attention to the fact that allthe hospital accommodation at Vladivostock was full, and requested that the Japanese Government should be asked to relieve the pressure, as not only were the medical arrangements at Vladivostockinsufficient, but the Czechs were urgently in need of medicalassistance in the firing-line.Questioned as to what troops were available for immediate despatch to Vladivostock, the Chief of the Imperial General staff said that there was one battalion at Hong Kong, which could be despatched at short notice, and, with regard to French troops, he understood that some Colonial troops were available, but it wouldbe necessary for him to obtain information from the French militaryauthorities. With regard to artillery, it had not been intended tosend any, and to the best of his knowledge General Wilson said thathe did not think there was any available in Vladivostock, and thatthe artillery which could be sent in the quickest time woidd be from india.In this connection the Deputy First Sea Lord said that the navy would not be able to be of much assistance as regards artillery, for at the most only one or two 6-inch guns could be landed from.M.S. &quot;Suffolk.&quot;The Prime Minister said that it was very important that weshould consider what steps we could take to support the Czechs ifPresident Wilson came to the conclusion that he was unable toassist us.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs favoured the idea of sending troops as soon as possible, and expressed the opinion thatthe movement of Allied troops to Vladivostock, in order to protectsupplies and preserve order, could not be considered as intervention in Russia. Mr. Balfour asked what action was to be taken withreference to the telegram read by Admiral Hope on the subject of medical assistance being given by the Japanese Government, and itwas agreed that the Foreign Office should communicate with theBritish Ambassador as soon as possible. .Bombing Attacks. 7. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that the usual bombing attacks on Bruges docks had been carried Out.
The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should take irnme-diate steps to move a British battalion to Vladivostockfor the purpose of preserving order there anil protectingsupplies;(6.) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should telephoneto the French military &quot;authorities, informing them thatthe British Government regarded the situation at vladivostock as so serious that they proposed to send troops there, and should suggest that French troops should be moved to Vladivostock, and, if so, should ask the number of such troops and the probable date of their arrival;(c.) After communicating with the French military authorities,the Chief of the Imperial General Staff should see thePrime Minister and report to him the reply that hadbeen received ;(d.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should telegraph to the British Ambassador at Tokio, informing him ofthe action which was being taken by the BritishGovernment, and requesting him to impress on theJapanese Government the urgent necessity of givingmedical assistance in Vladivostock and to the czech troops in the firing-line ;(e.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should telegraph to Lord Beading, requesting him to inform PresidentWilson of the action which was being taken and thereasons for such action, and that we had made an urgentappeal to the French to co-operate.Murmansk. 9. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to a telegramfrom General Poole, asking that an additional British battalionshould be sent to Murmansk.It was pointed out that there were now about 1,200 Britishtroops there.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook to make enquiries as to what further troops it would be possible to despatch, and to report to the War Cabinet.Increase in EailwayFacilities between france and Italy.10. With regard to Joint Note No. 33 from the Military Repre-sentatives to the Supreme War Council, setting out certain measureswhich they consider it imperative, to take in order to increase the capacity of the Modane line with a view to possible strategicdemands The War Cabinet referred the matter to the Prime Minister for settlement. *The Alien Question: 1L with reference to War Cabinet 435, Minute 9, the war position of Persons   Cabinet had before them the following documents of Alien Birth.Letter to Mr. Greer from Mr. Sutherland, &quot; Pall Mall Gazette,&quot;20th June, 1918 (Paper G.T.-5074),Memoranda by Sir E. Troup (Papers G.T.-4931 and 4961),Memorandum by the secretary of State for Home Affairs (paper g.T.-5067),together with the report to the Prime Minister by the Members ofthe House of Commons who had been invited to make recommenda-tions.* Joint Note No. 33 was approved by the Prime Minister the same afternoon.
Mr. Chamberlain stated that he desired to record a respectfulprotest against the way in which this matter had been treated. Aquestion of public policy of grave importance had been referred,without consultation with the Cabinet, to a Committee of Membersof Parliament whom he thought not very well suited for the purposeowing to the strong views they had already expressed, and theirreport to the Prime Minister had been published in the papers before it was seen by any Member of the Cabinet.The Prime Minister said it was published before he himself hadreceived it.Mr. Chamberlain said he thought this procedure was highlyimproper and lacking in consideration for the Cabinet. It made thetask of the Cabinet much more difficult.The Prime Minister agreed that the publication of the report was improper. He did not know by whom the publication had beenmade. He explained that he had not appointed a Committee, butthat, after consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, he had instructed Captain Guest to ask these particular Members of Parlia-meut who had taken an active part in the agitation for increasedstringency to state definitely what suggestions they would them-selves make.Sir G. Cave observed that the Members in their letter to thePrime Minister had given quite a different colour to the request.The Prime Minister further explained that the Members had not taken any evidence from the Departments concerned, though theyhad no doubt a mass of information before them from other sources.The Prime Minister said that he was convinced that there wasa real uneasiness in the public mind, which had been exploited andintensified by agitation in the press. The Government, in coming to a decision on the subject, should not be influenced by the factthat there was an unsavoury background to the agitation. Therehad been several incidents during the war which forced anyoneconversant with the facts to suspect enemy participation, cases of sabotage, for example, and, in particular, an explosion at a corditefactory at a very critical moment in the history of the war. in times of peace, as between the State and the individual, the benefitof the doubt shoidd go to the individual; but in war time thebenefit of the doubt should go to the State. Whenever the Alliessuffered a serious reverse he received anonymous letters fromGermans in this country expressing delight at the enemy&apos;s success.He received similar letters after he had made some important public statement in connection with the war. It was necessary, in hisopinion, to take some steps to reassure the reasonable elements inthe community that the Government were taking no improper risks.It was significant that a Sub-Committee of the Labour Re-settlementCommittee had passed a strong resolution calling on the Governmentto intern all enemy aliens. The public were particularly concerned about the employment of persons of enemy origin in government offices, where they might obtain information which could be of thegreatest value to the enemy.Sir George Cave agreed that there was a widespread publicinterest in the matter, which had been fomented by the press, andhe was prepared to take some measures in order to allay such public feeling. In saying that, he did not for a moment admit, and wouldnot allow it to be said, that the officials of the Home Office who bad-dealt with the matter had in the slightest degree been negligent inthe performance of their duties. It was evident that the Parlia-mentary group were very ill-informed as to the present practice. Oftheir recommendations he thought the.only important ones were thefirst, the third, and the seventh. The seventh called on the WarCabinet to discharge forthwith from Government offices all persons of enemy origin. The expression &quot; enemy origin &quot; was ambiguous,and it was noticeable that the Report had omitted any definition of it.Considerable discussion ensued as to the interpetration to be given to the phrases &quot; enemy origin &quot; and &quot; enemy association&quot;should the recommendation be adopted.[1.365-443] &quot; C
6Sir Eric Geddes called attention to the rule obtaining in thenavy, which regulated entrance of Naval Cadets into the Service : &quot; Candidates must be of pure European descent and thesons either of natural-born or naturalised British subjects. Indoubtful cases the burden of clear proof will rest upon the parents or guardians of candidates.&quot;The First Lord did not think it would be practicable to go beyond that rule, and it would be a very severe measure to appoint a Committee, as had sometimes been suggested, to review the loyaltyof officers who had been accepted under this rule, and who for manyyears had rendered distinguished service to the State.The Director of Military Intelligence agreed generally with therecommendations of the report, and suggested that a system of DistrictTribunals might be setup to hear applications for exemption. Whatwas mainly needed was to stiffen the present regulations. He thought the enemy aliens who were now at large were a military clanger, butnot a very great military danger. Spies were more largely drawn from neutral than from enemy countries. Further, personsnaturalised before I 914 were at least as dangerous as those who hadbeen naturalised since, because the recent cases had been very carefully investigated, whereas there was not the same rigid scrutinybefore the war. He suggested that there should be a military representative on the Advisory Committee.Mr. Munro said that in Scotland there was an Advisory Com-mittee acting on similar lines to that, presided over by Mr. JusticeSankey and Mr. Justice Younger. The Scottish Committee waspresided over by a Judge of the Court of Session Sir HenryDalziel had been a member of this Committee, and Mr. Munro hadnot heard that he had dissented from its findings. It might bedesirable to strengthen its personnel, and, in order to restore public confidence, it could be directed to revise the whole list of exemptions,which had already been twice reviewed. The general policy followedby the Committee was to intern or deport male Germans unless they could show the Committee special cause for exemption.The Committee had. thus given effect to the presumption infavour of the State to which the Prime Minister had referred.It was generally agreed to be advisable to strengthen theCentral Advisory Committees, and it might be arranged that theyshould sit locally, but opinion was opposed to a system of localtribunals.It was also agreed that it was desirable to apply to the CivilService a test similar to that quoted above as in force in the navy and the army. Some modification might be necessary in &apos;its application to the Post Office, but postmasters should come underthe ride. It was further proposed to be desirable to make the wholeof the United Kingdom a prohibited area, and to allow residencetherein by an enemy alien only after the granting of a permit.The War Cabinet decided To appoint the following committee sir George Cave (in the Chair),Sir Albert Stanley,Mr. Munro,General Macdonogh, andA Representative of the Intelligence Division of theAdmiralty,to prepare a comprehensive statement for the considerationof the War Cabinet at a subsequent meeting with a viewto its communication to the House of Commons ; such statement to be based on the memorandum of the HomeSecretary, developed as necessary in the light of thediscussion as set out above.
Treatment of enemy Aliens.Enemy-ownedPatents.Restriction of enemy Businessafter the War.12. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade dealing with the question of restricting trading relations with enemy aliens after the war(Paper G.T.-5066), and a draft reply to a parliamentary question on the subject of enemy-owned patents, trade-marks, and designs(Paper G.T.-5070).Sir Albert Stanley outlined the main features of the proposals set forth in the memorandum. As regards the conduct of businessesby enemy aliens after the war, it was proposed that legislation should be introduced to prevent businesses of any kind (includingbanks) being carried on in the United Kingdom wholly or mainly for the benefit or under the control of enemy aliens for a specified period of years after the war. The object of the proposals was toput an end to economic penetration by the enemy. Unless some such steps were taken, the businesses belonging to the enemywhich had been taken over during the war would again emergeunder enemy control on the conclusion of peace. The policy now recommended was more drastic than that put forth in connectionwith the non-ferrous metals, as no licences whatever would be issued.It was pointed out that the policy recommended by the Presidentof the Board of Trade completely reversed that which had hitherto been followed in this country, and, if adopted, was certain to lead towidespread agitation, and to a new cleavage of political parties.The War Cabinet decided To refer the matter to the Committee mentioned in the previousminute, in order that the subject might be included in the comprehensive statement to be prepared by the Committee.In case of disagreement in the preparation of the statement,the War Cabinet requested the points of disagreement tobe indicated.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 10, 1918.o
