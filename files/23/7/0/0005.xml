The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that the latestO    sive. information as to the locality of the next German offensive related to the Arras-Amiens front, but that, as the Germans were preparedeverywhere, it was possible that the attack might be on Abbevillethrough Amiens, or on Paris.In reply to a question as to whether an attack might be delivered in two places, the Chief of the Imperial General Staffreplied that the Germans were strong enough to try both, but adivided attack would not be so menacing as a single attack, withdemonstrations along other parts of the line.Operations by 4.

Australians on the 4th Jidy had been very successful, and itappeared that the 13th German division had been practicallyknocked out; further, that prisoners had been taken from 11different battalions, which indicated that parts of 3 german divisions had been engaged. As against this, our force consisted of only one division of Australians and 1,100 American troops.Our casualties were not heavy.Questioned as to the arrangements under which american troops co-operated with ours, the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff stated that General Pershing claimed the right to say whetherthe American troops incorporated in our battalions were siifficientlytrained before they were called upon to carry out an offensive. Hesaid that the American troops employed hadidone remarkably well,and were a very fine body of men.German Divisions. 5- The Chief of the Imperial General Staff made the followingstatemenfront: statement as regards the available German divisions on the WesternFresh divisions.In Prince Rupprecht&apos;s army there were ... 41In the Crown Prince&apos;s army there were ... 12On the rest of the front there were ... ...        4Total   ... ... ...      57The Germans had available for roulement the following : Divisions.Prince Rupprecht&apos;s army ... ... ...       40The Crown Prince&apos;s army... ... ...       19On the rest of the front    ... ... ...       11Total   ... ... ...       70which meant that the Germans could put into an attack 57 fresh divisions, plus the divisions they already had in the line, making atotal of from 70 to 80 divisions.
The Czecho-Slovak 6. With reference to War Cabinet 437, Minute 12, the Chief of forces- the Imperial General Staff&apos; informed the War Cabinet that theDirector of Military Intelligence had been to Paris in order, to attend a meeting relative to the financing of the Czecho-Slovaks, and thatan arrangement had been come to by which the French agreed topay them so long as they remained in Siberia, and that we shouldbe responsible for their expenses from the time of their embarkationat a Russian port an arrangement which the Treasury had approved.East Africa. 7.

As regards the divisions in line, the opposing forces in that respect were about equal, and the sum-totalof divisions on the Western front was as follows : -German divisions ... ... ...   205Allied divisions   ... ... ...   176General Wilson added that the Germans were getting back fresh divisions quicker than the Americans were coming in, although, onthe German side, there was a limit to this increase ; on the other side, however, the acceleration would be continuous. The germans could now put in a bigger attack than they did on the 21st March.Questioned as to the strength of the battle front, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff stated that we could not do more than wewere doing at present to improve the same, and that our trenches were very good, although possibly the French were not quite on a parwith ours. Taking all the factors into consideration, he consideredthat our position was better than it was on the 21st March, althoughit was weaker in the respect that we were not in a position to giveground, as was possible on that occasion.Mr. Balfour added that he had been informed by Field-marshal sir Douglas Haig, during his recent visit to France, that some of the poorer classes of German divsions were being put back into the linewithout being brought up to establishment.

H.M.S. &quot; Medea&quot; attacked an enemy submarine on the6th J illy, off Whitby, with depth charges. Three bodieswere afterwards seen, and it was considered, as theresult of subsequent search, that the submarine was destroyed.(6.) Torpedo-boat No. 25 attacked a submarine on the 7th Julywith depth charges, and the submarine was probably sunk.(c.) Two enemy submarines attacked a convoy in the Mediter-ranean which was proceeding from Gibraltar to Genoa.An Italian destroyer, which was escorting the convoy,attacked the submarines with depth charges, and claimed to have sunk one.The Adriatic.Bombing raids .10.

With reference to the War Cabinet 437, Minute 14, theWar Cabinet had under consideration a report by the Minister ofInformation on the subject of periodical publication in America ofthe total casualties in the British Army (Paper G.T.-4954), whichpointed out that the information received from America laid great stress on the utterly false impression prevailing there of theproportion of the fighting in France done by troops of the UnitedKingdom, which was having a very bad effect on the American viewof Great Britain&apos;s effort. The memorandum stated that theSecretary of State for War had no objection to the publication of our total casualties up to a certain date, say three months in arrears, but,before taking such a step, desired the approval of the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet had a preliminary discussion on the matter,and decided-To postpone further consideration until Lord Beaverbrook couldbe present.Exchange ofPrisoners of &quot;War.13. With reference to War Cabinet 441, Alinute 6, the PrimeMinister read to the War Cabinet a letter which he had receivedfrom Lord Stamfordham, Private Secretary to the King, in which he stated that the King was very anxious regarding the condition ofBritish prisoners oi war in Germany, and especially those prisonerswho were captured in 1914. According to information received byHis Majesty, our men were being very badly treated, and he trustedthat, in any agreement arrived at, it should be stipulated that thosemen captured in 1914 should be sent home first.Sir George Cave said that, so far as his information went, thetreatment of our prisoners was not equally bad in all the camps ;it appeared to depend on the Camp Commandant or the corps commander. Some of the men arriving in Holland were in good condition, but they were officers and NC.O.&apos;s, and had not been kept
Civil Servants&apos;Memorial Service.14. The War Cabinet decided that a member of the WarCabinet should be present at the Civil Servants&apos; memorial service to be held on the 11th July, as representative of both the imperial war Cabinet and the War Cabinet.Employment ofConscientiousObjectors in theCivil Service.15. The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew the attention of theWar Cabinet to a question which was to be asked in the House of* The agreement of the Dominion Prime Ministers or principal representativeswas obtained early this iifternoon. M P.A.H., July 8, .1918.at work like the privates. Regarding the privates captured in1914, these men would, if the agreement now under discussion,were ratified, be the first men to be sent home. In fact, thenumbers would include all those captured by the Germans up to thebeginning of the Somme battle.The War Cabinet then discussed a memorandum by Sir GeorgeCave (Paper G.T.-5042) with reference to the negotiations whichhad been taking place at The Hague.Sir George Cave stated that he wished the approval of theCabinet to the points regarding the exchange of prisoners, as con-tained in his telegram to The Hague, No. 1622, of the 6th July(Appendix). Sir George Cave explained that he thought one Britishcombatant (mainly officers or N.C.O.&apos;s of the old army) and one british civilian for every four German civilians was the bestexchange we could hope to get, in the circumstances. He statedthat all through the negotiations the Germans were playing onour desire to get the prisoners home, and this placed the british delegates at a disadvantage. He felt that it was important to adhere to the clause prohibiting the employment of repatriated prisonersfor any military purpose in a country foreign to the country of origin.In answer to a question as to whether German prisoners held by theDominions were included in this exchange, Sir George Cave statedthat this was the case. German subjects in China, however, werenot included in this agreement, and the British delegates had refusedto discuss the subject.Mr. Bonar Law stated that the feeling on the subject of prisonersof war ran very high in the House of Commons, and he would not like the negotiations to break down unless there was very good reason for their doing so, which could be given to the House of - -Commons. He felt, however, that we should maintain our position regarding the employment of prisoners in a country foreign to thecountry of origin.Lord Milner said that, in the circumstances, the proposals foran exchange, as laid down in Sir George Cave&apos;s memorandum,appeared to be the best obtainable.The Adjutant-General agreed.A question was then asked regarding the exchange of prisonerswith Turkey, and it was stated that a question was to be asked onthe subject in the House that night.Mr. Hope said that it was impossible to start fresh negotiationswhilst Lord Newton and General BeMeld were still at The Hague,but that, should the negotiations at The Hague materialise into anagreement, there would be plenty of time in which to open freshnegotiations with Turkey before the exchange already arrangedunder the Berne Agreement actually took place.The War Cabinet approved Sir George Cave&apos;s proposals ascontained in his memorandum (Paper G.T.-5042) and inhis telegram to The Hague No. 1622, dated the 6th July,1918, subject to the approval of the representatives of theDominions * now in this country, and also subject to sir george Cave making it quite clear that the agreement doesnot apply to submarine prisoners.
Commons on Tuesday, the 9th July, asking for an assurance thatConscientious Objectors who are employed in the Civil Service, andwho have refused to serve in the army, should not be promotedover the heads of Civil Servants who have served, or are serving, inthe army.The War Cabinet decided that A reply should be given by the Chancellor of the Exchequer tothe effect that the Government was prepared to give suchan assurance as that asked for.The Secretary was instructed to forward this decision to theTreasury,  for circulation by them  to   all   GovernmentDepartments.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 8, 1918.APPENDIX.Paraphrase of a telegram No. 1622, dated the 6th July, 1918, from Sir George Gaveto Sir W. Townley (The Hague).1. I FAVOUR, acceptance of the offer that Germany will exchange one Britishcombatant and one British civilian for every four German civilians. The first Britishcombatants taken to be those of all ranks now interned in Holland and Switzerland.If the surplus of British combatants in Holland or Switzerland or British civilians inGermany is exhausted and there are still German civilians for exchange, Germany tomake up the deficiency by British combatants from Germany.2. The exchange of officers now in Holland is favoured, but such an exchangenot to be made until after repatriation of 15,000 privates on each side, and possiblyof some civilians.3. You should insist on the clause prohibiting employment of repatriated prisonersfor any military purpose in a country foreign to the country of origin.4. Except as regards the purchase of ships, the changes proposed in arrangementsfor transport from overseas are open to strong objection. I consider that the annexapproved by Kitson should be adhered to.5. I suggest that the agreement should cease to operate on the 1st August, 1919,and that no provision be made to determine or continue agreement after that date.Cabinet will be asked, on Monday to telegraph their views with reference to theabove.
