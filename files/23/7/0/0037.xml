Threatened 1. With reference to War Cabinet 468, Minute 12, the WarEailway Strike. Cabinet had before thern a memorandum by Mr. Barnes (paper g.T.-5705) dealing with the railwaymen&apos;s demand for anincreased wage, and a memorandum by the Committee on Pro-duction, on procedure in regard to the method of arranginggeneral changes in wages (Paper G.T.-5706).Mr. Barnes gave an account of the negotiations which hadtaken place on the previous day between the Board of Trade andthe Executives of the various railwaymen&apos;s organisations. the railwaymen demanded that they should have a 10s. increase intheir war wage, that the women should be paid 105. as well asthe men, and that it should apply to all their members in the shops as well as on the traffic system. The pre-war wage averaged28s. per week, and the present demand, added to previous con-cessions, would, in effect, amount to an addition of 35s. on thepre-war wage, or, roughly, an advance of 125 per cent. No othersingle industry, taken as a whole, had obtained a general awarddoubling its wages except, perhaps, the carters. The railwaymenbased their claim partly on the rise in the cost of living, andpartly on the fact that their pre-war wage level was very low.The Government had offered an increase of 5s. This had beenaccepted by the Association of Locomotive Engineers but not bythe National Union of Railwaymen. The 5s. would mean 80s.upon a pre-war average wage of 28s., and would be equivalent toabout 107 per cent. This was as far as the Government daredgo on the merits of the case; to go beyond that figure would be certain to stimulate fresh demands. Mr. Barnes further sug-gested, as a means of surmounting the present trouble, that, inaddition to an increase of 5s., to be calculated from August last,some figure should be taken as representing the increase in thecost of living up to that date, and that henceforward war wages should rise and fall with the increased cost of living, at the rateof, say, Is. per week for every 4 per cent, increase in the cost ofliving, these provisions to be operated by, or on behalf of, aa properly constituted arbitration authority. In his opinion itwas necessary for the War Cabinet to reaffirm their decision ofthe 7th January, 1918 (War Cabinet 317, Minute 1), viz.: &quot;All applications for an increase in war advances andwage disputes arising therefrom should be referred for decision to the Ministry of Labour, who may refer them tothe Committee on Production.&quot;    1That decision should be strictly adhered to. Departures from it by certain Departments had proved extremely disconcerting tothe Committee on Production.The President of the Board of Trade said that in the present dispute the Board of Trade found itself negotiating not only with the National Union of Railwaymen and the Association of locomotive Engineers and Eiremen, but also with the CraftUnions. It was now demanded that in all railway undertakings,and not alone those under Government control, the operatives ofboth sexes should be put on a basis of equality, that advancesshould apply to the shop men as well as the traffic men, andshould be elated back to the 1st August, 1918. The locomotive engineers&apos; Union further asked that engine men should be specially treated, and that the advance of 5s. should be calculated in their case upon a basis of an 8-hours&apos; day which would, infact, secure to them considerably more than 5s. per week. Thiswas a demand which it was impossible for the Government to concede,, because, if conceded, it would immediately spread to- other grades and set in motion a fresh cycle of demands. Withregard to the shop men, there was disagreement between the CraftUnions and the National Union. The Board of Trade had sug-gested that any question concerning shop men should be referredto the Committee on Production, but this was not acceptable to
3WG 474the National Union. In his (Sir Albert Stanley:s) view, theGovernment should adhere to their offer, which was acceptable to the Craft Unions. It was agreed that whatever decision wasreached in the case of the general engineering trade by the Com-mittee on Production should be extended to railway shop men.With reference to the women workers, they were now paid halfthe bonus granted to the men. The Board of Trade had proposedthat any increase granted as a result of the present,negotiations to men should also be granted to women, but that the question of equal pay for equal work should await the Report of the Corn-mittee on Women&apos;s Wages, now sitting. This was not acceptable to the National Union.The delegates were against accepting the Governments offer of 5s., and unless a more favourable offer was forthcoming therewas every probability that the men would strike. Suggestionshad been made on the lines described by Mr. Barnes, that,coupled with the offer of 5s., the Government should set up some machinery for dealing automatically with future increases in relation to the cost of living. It had been suggested that thereshould be a Committee set up, composed of representatives ofthe Railway Executive and of the Railway Unions, with thePresident of the Board of Trade as Chairman. This Committeeshould proceed on the principle of granting increases in futureso as to retain the same relation between wages raid cost of livingas the wage figure now decided on. bore to the present cost ofliving. The case put forward by the railwaymen for 10s. asagainst 5s. was based on the general ground that other workers,like the miners, the engineers, and the policemen, had done somuch better during the war than the railwaymen. They laidspecial emphasis on the fact that, in the case of the police, regardwas had to their very low wages before the war. He agreed thatthe wages of the railwaymen were unduly low before the war,and they would undoubtedly have been advanced in 1914 but forthe war. Taken in the aggregate, their earnings were not as high as those paid to the other chief industrial workers in the country.In many centres employers in other industries had granted verylarge advances to their men, and the wives of railwaymen feltthat they were handicapped in competition with the waves of the better paid artizans. In some munition industries, boys werebringing home more money than an engine driver with 25 years&apos;experience.He wished to have the guidance of the War Cabinet as tothe course he should take. The Executives of the men were tomeet that morning, and there would be a meeting of the delegatesin the evening. Were the Cabinet prepared to take their standon an offer of 5s. (dating back to August), coupled with a sug-gestion for automatic machinery for future wage settlements,leaving the Executives to go back to the delegates with that offer ?He would be prepared to offer to address a full meeting of the delegates, and, if that were accepted, would the War Cabinetauthorise him to offer 6s. as the absolutely final figure of theGovernment, if there were a chance of avoiding a strike on that basis ? He thought it would be a profound mistake for theGovernment to make 5s. its final offer. He was convinced the delegates would not accept that; but, whatever the final decisionof the Cabinet, he pleaded earnestly that it should be strictlyadhered to, and that there should be no subsequent weakening.It was true that in several industrial disputes during the warthe Government had been advised by employers and by the men&apos;sleaders that if certain terms were offered there would be no strike,or, if there were a strike, it would be of short duration, but such advice had repeatedly been found to be wrong. The case of the railwaymen was one of the worst on which to risk a great struggle,because of the admittedly low level of their pre-war wage.
Sir David Harrel urged that to set up a new wage tribunal,as suggested, would place the Committee on Production in a falseposition. The members of the Committee on Production heldvery strongly that all questions of dispute concerning wage orterms of service should go to the Ministry of Labour, and that even at an early period in such disputes, whenever there was a sign of serious uneasiness, the Minister of Labour should be &quot;*informed and his judgment exercised as to how far any Depart-ment should proceed before referring the matter to the Committeeon Production. In the light of the awards of the Committee on production, there was nothing inconsistent in now granting an advance of 5s. to the railwaymen and bringing their war advancesup to 305., but to go beyond that would undoubtedly cause trouble.Sir David Shackleton pointed out the possibility of the Com-mitlee on Production being enlarged so as to include representa-tives of the railway service. If the 5s. were now granted as fromthe 1st August, 1918, it could be announced at the same time thatany claims for a further advance wrould be considered next month,and thereafter periodically every four months, and automatic-increases granted in proportion to the rise in the cost of living.It was most desirable that the wage awards for the different industries should synchronise. Any claims coming before Depart-ments for advances beyond the level already awarded by the Com-mittee on Production should be referred to the Committee on production. On the last occasion of a dispute with the railway-men the Committee on Production were put in an impossible position by the granting to the National Union of an advance inexcess of the amount wdiich had been awarded by the Committee on production to the locomotive engineers, and in consequence theCommittee were forced to issue a fresh award to the locomotive engineers.Sir Albert Stanley said that neither the miners nor the railwaymen were willing to have their disputes referred to theMinistry of Labour, and the only way in which it would be possibleto get the railwaymen&apos;s case sent to the Committee on production would be by proclaiming a strike.Sir Herbert Walker reminded the War Cabinet that inAugust 1917 the Board of Trade had converted the railwaymen&apos;swar bonus into a war wage, which would count for overtime andfor Sunday time. The value of this concession was already equalto an additional 4s. or 5s. to the 30s. now proposed. On the general question, Sir Herbert Walker said that the Government were con-fronted with a very grave situation. He was satisfied that thepresent agitation was not the work of the leaders of the NationalUnion, but of certain extreme members of the delegate meeting,who were determined to cause trouble. The offer of 5s. was areasonable one, but telegrams were pouring in showing that 5s.would not be acceptable. The extremists could bring the traffic ofthe large centres, such as Glasgow, Sheffield, and South Wales, toa standstill on the following morning, and he believed they were out to do this unless they got more than 5s. He did not think thestrike would last long, but it would be very serious, inasmuch asit would bring out the miners. Experience had shown thatwherever the highly paid miners and the lower paid railwajmienwere in contact, as, for example, in South Wales, discontent andagitation flourished. He hoped that the War Cabinet would putSir Albert Stanley in a position to offer 6s., if absolutely necessary.General Childs stated that, in calculating the effect of a strike on military requirements, it was important to know how general itwas expected a strike would be.Sir Herbert Walker replied that it was impossible to say, butthe shunters and goods guards could practically hold up the traffic -of the country.
.5WG 474Admiral Tothill stated that the Admiralty had sufficient supplies of coal for ten days.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) Mr. Barnes and Sir Albert Stanley should continue thenegotiations on the following basis: That the railwaymen receive an immediateadvance of 5s. per week (making a total war bonus of30s. per week) as from the 5th August, and, in addition,their claim for a further advance be considered next month, when the periodical general revision of wages in the other principal industries will take place, theconsideration then to take into account the cost ofliving (as compared with the cost of living on the 1stAugust). The question to be reconsidered periodicallyat intervals of four months, and in the meantime an agreed scale of cost of living percentages to be settled and be the basis of future.changes.(5.) Sir Albert Stanley should arrange to meet the delegatesthat evening, and, if it were found that the above terms were not acceptable, and that a strike appearedinevitable, then a special meeting of the Cabinet should immediately be called.(c.) Sir Albert Stanley should prepare a statement of theGovernment&apos;s case, with a view to immediate publica-tion if such a course became necessary, and shouldsummon the editors of leading newspapers, with a viewto placing them in full possession of the Governmentscase, so that public opinion might be properly informed of the facts.(d.) The War Office should estimate for what period thearmy could endure a strike without serious disturbancaof its programme.The Western 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarFront. Cabinet that the British had attacked that morning between north of St. Quentin and Epehy, on a front of about 15 kilometres, withthe object of driving the Germans back into the Hindenburg Line.No details had yet been received as to the results.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff indicated thepossibilities of offensives in other directions.Questioned as to the recent offensive by the Americans in the st. Mihiel salient, General Wilson stated that seven United Statesdivisions had been employed, and that their losses had been verysmall, only 500 to 600 men to a division, from which it might besaid that the total American losses oh that front during the last few days only amounted to 5,000.Trans-Caucasia. 3. In continuation of War Cabinet 473, Minute 3, the deputy first Sea Lord stated that a telegram had been received to theeffect that the British were now preparing to evacuate Enzeli.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that the WarOffice had no information as to what ships were got away fromBaku, but that a telegram had been sent to General Marshallasking him for a reply to a number of specific questions, which,when received, would, it was hoped, throw further light on thesituation in that area. Such reply might be hoped for in the nearfuture.Submarine 4. The Deputy First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet thatActivity. there had been a recrudescence of submarine activity in theEnglish Channel.
Co-Ordination of 5. The  War Cabinet had before them memoranda by theWork Connected Secretary of State for War (Paper G.T.-5332), the First Sea Lordwith Prisoners of (paper G.T.-5390), and Lord Newton (Paper G.T.-5357), relating&quot; l&quot; to co-ordination of work connected with prisoners of war.Lord Newton said that his suggestion was that the Inter-departmental Committee which at present existed, and on whichall the Departments interested in prisoners of war questions were represented, should be presided over by a Minister of Cabinetrank. He thought that if this was done the Chairman would beable to arbitrate speedily upon all differences arising between theDepartments concerned. The Chairman would also settle ques-tions of policy, but he did not propose that matters of detail shouldbe brought before him. With the present arrangement, great dis-satisfaction was caused by the fact that questions in the House ofCommons were replied to by different individuals representingdifferent Departments, and that there was no one recognised headto whom such questions could be addressed.Mr. Macpherson said that he agreed with Lord Newton&apos;suggestion, but thought that the duties of the Chairman wouldmake a considerable call on a Minister&apos;s time, the questions being so numerous that he would have little leisure for any other business.The question arose whether the Chairman of the proposed inter-departmental Committee would be called upon to transactall the business connected with prisoners of war, or whether hewould only decide differences of opinion which arose between departments. If the Committee met twice a week it would clearlybecome an administrative Committee and direct prisoners of war policy.It was further asked what was the sort of questions theChairman of the suggested Committee would be called upon todecide.Lord Newton replied that questions such as reprisals,exchange of prisoners of war with Turkey, and German prisoners in China, would, in his opinion, be matters of urgency which might properly be dealt with by the Chairman of the Inter-departmentalCommittee.Sir George Cave enquired &quot;whether the proposed Committeewould take over the administration of all civil and militaryprisoners of war camps in this country. He could understand thenecessity of setting up a body to deal with questions arising inregard to prisoners of war in enemy countries, but civil andmilitary prisoners of war camps in this country were at present being administered quite successfully by the Home Office and WarOffice.Mr. Bonar Law said that the House of Commons was more interested in the position of our prisoners abroad than the con-dition of German prisoners of war in this country, and questions were continually being asked as to whether an effective department was being set up in this connection.It was suggested that there were two proposals before theCabinet: (i.) To put a Cabinet Minister in the Chair of the Inter-departmental Committee in order to arrive at quickdecisions when Departments disagreed.(ii.) To appoint a Cabinet Minister who would deal solelywith prisoner of war questions.Lord Curzon said that what appeared to be wanted wassomeone of Cabinet rank who would be in the last resort responsiblefor prisoner of war questions. If a Committee were set up, theCabinet Minister would find it difficult to fit in the Chairmanshipwith his other duties. He suggested -that the Committee mighthave two Cabinet Ministers upon it, one representing the House of
Commons and another representing the House of Lords. when one of these Ministers could not attend, the other would be avail-able, and he thought that in this way the burden of the work mightbe divided.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To accept in principle the proposal to appoint as Chair-man of the present Inter-departmental Prisoners ofWar Committee a Minister of Cabinet rank.(&amp;.) That the Chairman of this Committee should, beresponsible for all questions affecting British prisonersof war in enemy countries, and should settle any differences that might arise between the Departmentsdealing with prisoners of war, subject to the Depart-ments&apos; right of appeal to the Cabinet in matters ofreally vital importance.(c.) That the nomination of the Chairman of this Committeeshould be settled after further consideration.6. The War Cabinet took note of a memorandum by LordNewton (Paper G.T.-5707) on the condition of British prisonersof war in Turkey, and decided that The memorandum should be brought before the Inter-departmental Committee referred to in the previousMinute at the earliest opportunity.(Initialled) A.
