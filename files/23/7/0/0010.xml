2Western Front. 1. WITH reference to War Cabinet 446, Minute 1, the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff said that 30 enemy divisions had been identified up to the present time, of which 9 divisions belonged toPrince Rupprecht s army. The number of divisions identified onthe previous day had been 26, and the 4 additional divisions that had been identified during the past 24 hours had all been of theCrown Prince&apos;s army. In reply to a question as to whether he considered that this attack by the Germans was their big attack, theChief of the Imperial General Staff said that he did not think thatwe were yet in a position to judge, and that we must wait for more information. Personally, he was far from being persuaded that itwas the big attack, having regard to the fact that up to now only30 divisions had been identified. On the other hand, the opinion was expressed that the Germans had made a formidable attack east of Rheims, and that the attack had been repulsed, according to french reports, with very heavy losses to the enemy. If the french had really done what they claimed to have done in putting down their barrage on the front trenches of the enem5r at a time whenthose trenches were full of enemy troops about to make the advance,then it might well be that heavy punishment had resulted.The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to a telegramfrom General du Cane of 16th July to the effect that our general headquarters considered that probably an attack by sixteen oreighteen divisions would take place north and south of Kemmel in three or four days&apos; time. General Foch was inquiring into thesituation in Flanders, particularly as to the disposition of theBritish reserves and the ability of the Commander-in-Chief to meetsuch an attack with the resources at his disposal.The War Cabinet discussed the effect of a big attack in flanders such as that indicated in General du Cane&apos;s telegram. Ifthe Germans were successful, it was not improbable that they mightget through to Dunkirk, the loss of which would be serious for us,especially from the Admiralty point of view, and disastrous for the belgians, who would probably have to yield their last acre of land to the enemy.AVith reference to the strength of the enemy, about which therewere conflicting reports, General Smuts, who had returned from france on the previous clay, reported that the opinion at general headquarters was that the offensive power of the enemy wasgetting low.According to the War Office calculations, Prince Rupprechthad 42 divisions in. reserve, of which 9 had gone south, leaving a balance of 33 fresh divisions. General Tleadquarters, on the other-hand, estimated that Prince Rupprecht had only 23 fresh divisions left.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the difference inthe figures was accounted for by the difference in the definition ofthe word &quot; fresh.&quot; The War Office reckoned that if a division hadtaken its turn of lying in the line and had received no severe punish-ment, when it, was pulled out after two or three days&apos; rest it was ready to fight. General Ideadquarters, on the other hand, reckonedthat such a division was not ready for three weeks. General Smutssaid that the enenxy were holding the line with 123 divisions, whichwere regarded by General Headquarters as unfit to attack inasmuch as they were badly battered and were clown in numbers. Wdienevera raid was made against them they were found to be weak. Inaddition to those 123 divisions the enemy were said to have 73divisions in reserve, of which 50 were fit and 23 were in processof recuperation. The conclusion at General Pleadquarters was thata formidable attack could no longer be made against us.The War Cabinet considered that it was too much to saythat the 123 divisions now holding&apos; the line were all unfit toattack. They were rather of the opinion that Prince Rupprecht had still sufficient fresh troops to make a formidable attack.
Submarines. 3,        Deputy First Sea Lord reported, with reference to an action with an enemy submarine off Spurn Head on the 13th July,that the wreck of a submarine had been located.American Convoys. 4. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he wished to draw the attention of the War Cabinet to the situation in regard to the convoy of American reinforcements, and to ask for the Cabinet&apos;sguidance.When the big German attack had started in March it became necessary to speed up the sending of American reinforcements.To this end the Admiralty had made special arrangements inregard to escort, which had involved the diverting of destroyers and other craft used for hunting enemy submarines, with theresult that the destruction of submarines had been reduced.When the convo\r system was started Admiral Duff had come to theconclusion that the maximum number of troopships that could be adequately escorted in one convoy was 10. Subsequently underpressure, this number had been worked up to an authorised maxi-mum of 14, and up to now the losses had been negligible. A stagehad now been reached, however, when more troops and consequentlymore stores were coming forward, and the Admiralty had been pressed to increase the number of vessels in convoy from 14 to 21.Admiral Duff felt that he could not take the responsibility forsanctioning this increase, and had refused to allow more than 14vessels conveying troops in one convoy.The First Lord asked for the approval of the Cabinet in regardto Admiral Duffs action. He pointed out how very regrettable itwould be if by increasing the number in the convoy there might bea bad disaster. Not only would there be a very heavy loss of life,but there would be an outcry in America. This outcry wouldprobably result in largely increased escorts even on Admiral Duffslow standard, which was by no means one devoid of risks. Largeconvoys also &quot;were so much a cause of anxiety that when circum-stances developed, as he would later instance, it was necessary to upset all our convoy arrangements in order to divert other escorts toprotect large convoys, thereby&apos; upsetting the programme,. wdiich theFirst Lord suggested would most probably in the. end cause a diminution in overseas traffic.. The First Lord described by meansof a map how a recent large convoy arriving off the coast ofIreland had been met by enemy submarines. In consequence theAdmiralty had had to increase the number of destroyers and othercraft to protect the convoy, with the result that aa outgoing convoyhad been unable to proceed, and thereby the working of the Americantrade generally had been more dislocated than would have been thecase if a more modest programme had been followed.The First Lord gave this as an. illustration of the point he wasendeavouring to make.Mr. Balfour urged that the Admiralty should not permit asingle ship to be included in a convoy beyond 14, or whatever they regarded as the limit of safety.As a temporary measure, until the views of the Shipping-Controller on the convoy system and its working had been heard bythe War Cabinet, they approved Admiral Duffs action in refusing to allow more than 14 vessels conveying troops in one convoy.[1365-447]    &apos; B 21 Loss of 2. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that H.M.S. &quot; Anchusa&quot;- H.M.S. &quot;Anchusa.&quot; (a s\oop attached to the 2nd Sloop Flotilla) was torpodoed and sunk on the 16th July, 30 miles north of Malin Head. She hadon board 92 officers and men ; 12 survivors had been brought in,but no officers had been saved.
Having regard to the large number of American troops now inFrance, they further agreed that there was not sufficient urgency tojustify the bringing over of American troops with an escort regarded by the Admiralty as totally inadequate to afford reasonable pro-tection.Notice of Questionsnot on the Agenda.5. The Secretary drew the attention of the War Cabinet to thefact that on two days running questions of urgency had been raisedwithout previous notice, which had resulted in inconvenience to ministers concerned on the Agenda.The War Cabinet agreed That Ministers should be requested to give the Secretary notice,even if it is of the shortest, and after the meeting has begun, when they want to raise questions of urgency, inorder, as far as possible, to avoid, inconveniencing the heads of Departments concerned on the Agenda.At the same time, the War Cabinet expressed the view that in times of great emergency, such as an offensive by theenemy. Ministers at the head of Departments must realise that the Agenda Avas especially liable to dislocation.Preference onDutiable Articles.6. With reference to War Cabinet 446, Minute 6, the WarCabinet continued, their discussion on the Report of the Committeeon Trade Relations of the United Kingdom within the Empire, onthe subject of Preference on Dutiable Articles (G.T.-4903). TheWar Cabinet approved of the recommendations contained in theReport of the Committee in so far as they dealt with preferentialtrade within the Empire. As regards trade relations with theAllies, they decided that In carrying out this policy, His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldhave careful regard to the interests of their Allies, andparticularly to the necessity of aiding those who have suffered special economic injury from the ravages of war.Coal v. Iron Ore. 7. The   War   Cabinet   had   under   consideration   a   paper(G.T.-5120) by the Minister of Munitions relative to either the useof 600 coal miners to obtain coal, or their transfer to the Cumberlandand Cleveland iron ore mines to obtain iron ore.The War Cabinet decided that Mr. churchill&apos;s paper (G.T.-5120) should be referred to theWar Priorities Committee.Propaganda:Dropping of leaflets by aircraft.8. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum(G.T.-5100) by the Minister of Information with regard to the dropping of pamphlets by aircraft behind the German lines. LordBeaverbrook explained that at the present moment the only meansof dropping pamphlets in enemy country was by the use of balloons.This method was very unsatisfactory, and could not achieve morethan partial success. He now asked that the Secretary of State forthe Air Force should allow a certain number of aeroplanes to beused for this purpose.Lord Weir stated that he would be very glad to fall in with lord Beaverbrook&apos;s request, provided that it could be proved thatthe dropping of pamphlets over enemy towns was achieving realresidts. He felt, himself, that the dropping of bombs was more effective as propaganda than the dropping of pamphlets. Lord Weirexplained that pamphlets could only be dropped from aeroplanes in
the day time, and that it was necessary for them to fly at a verygreat height, and he felt that work of this sort could not heeffectively done at a height of, say, 15,000 feet. It was impossiblefor our airmen to fly low over enemy towns during the day time.The Director of Military Intelligence then gave the figures asto the number and weight of pamphlets which had been dropped from balloons in France. . He said that with a 50-mile wind theseballoons were able to reach Germany, and that with a 20-mile windthey could reach Brussels and places in central Belgium.The question was asked as to whether useful propaganda couldbe found for dropping over German towns. In reply, it was statedthat the German authorities had concealed from the German people the number of American soldiers which were being shipped to europe, and that this subject might form very good material for a propaganda leaflet.Lord Weir stated that he was going over to Nancy at the endof this week, and would speak to General Trenchard about thematter, and endeavour to arrange for him to make experiments and find out whether the dropping of pamphlets from a high altitudeduring the day-time was likely to be an effective means of conveyingpropaganda to the German people.The AVar Cabinet approved of Lord Weir&apos;s suggestion.PeriodicalPublication inAmerica of total british Casualties.9. With reference to War Cabinet 442, Minute 12, in regard tothe publication of British casualties in the United States of America,the Prime Minister stated that he thought it would be better if theDominion Ministers were given a chance of discussing the matter,and he requested Lord Beaverbrook to attend the Imperial WarCabinet Meeting on the next day, when the matter would beconsidered.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 17, 1918.o
