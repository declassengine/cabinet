The western front.1. The Director of Military Intelligence explained by aid ofa map the advance that had been made on the previous day byBritish and French troops to the east and south-east of Amiens.This advance was of the greatest strategic importance, inasmuch asit helped to clear Amiens. Nine German divisions had beenreported opposite the British divisions, and three German divisionsopposite the French, making a total of twelve enemy divisionsengaged hr these operations. As regards the total number of enemyprisoners captured there appeared some uncertainty, but the australians claimed 6,000, the Canadians 4,000, the French 3,000,and the cavalry 1,000, making a total of 14,000 in all. TheDirector of Military Intelligence said that general headquarters had reported the previous night as being quiet, and that up to now theGermans had made no counter-attack, although an attack by two German divisions was expected to-day north of the Somme. Asatisfactory feature of the attack had been that the enemy bad been completely surprised. Two German batteries had actually been captured without firing a shot. There had been very heavy air fighting, and it was claimed that thirty-seven enemy aeroplanes hadbeen brought down.Bombing Attackon Durazzo.2. The First Sea Lord reported that five D.H. bombingmachines from Otranto, escorted by four camels, had attackedDurazzo on the 7th August. Eighteen 112-lb. bombs and one230-lb. bomb had been dropped. Six direct hits had been observedon the seaplane base, and a large fire had been started, which hadbeen seen 40 miles out to sea. All our machines had returned safely.Russia -.Conditions at petrograd.GermanBluejackets atSebastopol.3. The First Sea Lord said that a telegram had been receivedfrom Christiania reporting a message from the Naval Attache at petrograd, dated the 7th August, 1918, to the effect that all inlandand foreign telegraphic communication with the Allies was cut,and that Allied officers were forbidden to move from one townto another. Cholera was decreasing. All the Missions were safe.Reliable news had come from Sebastopol that 6,000 to 6,000 Germanbluejackets had arrived there. Crews were being trained for russian submarines, exercise being carried out daily near that port.Russian officers, however, wrere refusing to give any assistance intraining. The submarines would be sent to the Dardanelles as soonas the crews were sufficiently trained.Inter-AlliedProgrammeCommittees.4. Mr. Chamberlain reported that, at the request of the ForeignOffice, he had seen Mr. Summers, the head of the American WarMission sent by Mr. Baruch. Mr. Summers desired to discuss thedevelopment of the Inter-Allied Programme Committees, and, inparticular, expressed a desire that there should be some one memberof the British Government to whom he or Mr. Chandler Andersoncould address themselves in case of any difficulty arising. Mr. Cham-berlain had urged on Mr. Summers that American representatives should at once be appointed to all these Programme Committees, andMr. Summers had agreed that this should be done. Mr. Chamberlainsaid that he was prepared, subject to the approval of the War Cabinet,to act as the representative of the British Government for the purposeasked by Mr. Summers.The War Cabinet approved.
Naval Effort of 6. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theGreat Britain and    First Lord of the Admiralty, in regard to the naval effort of Greatthe United States    Britain and the United States of America (Paper G.T.-5307).ot America. The War Cabinet, having considered this Paper, took note ofthe fact that, since the Paper was written, the First Lord had hadan opportunity of discussing the matter with the Prime Minister,Mr. Pvoosevelt, the Assistant Secretary of the United States navy department, and with the Naval Affairs Committee of the House ofRepresentatives, and that he had hopes, from what had passed at these later discussions, that, in so far as the American Navy^-asdistinguished from their Mercantile Marine was concerned, theywould be prepared to take a broader view of their contribution tothe war at sea ; that they would develop the building of destroyers and auxiliary craft, including escort vessels, with the object of theUnited States bearing a share more commensurate with their respon-sibilities and with the magnitude of our naval effort.   This wouldIreland: . 5. The War Cabinet had before them a letter from the ChiefRecruiting. Secretary for Ireland (Paper G.T.-5340) in regard to recruiting inIreland.Mr.&apos;Shortt said that Ireland&quot; had been divided into ten districtsfor purposes of recruiting.    The Ministry of National Service hadallocated to each of these ten districts  their fair  quota of the, 50,000 recruits asked for by the 1st October, and of the subsequentmonthly numbers, as set forth in Lord FrenciVs Proclamation.Some time ago, a Conference had been held at the Ministry ofNational Service, at which there had been present representativesof the Irish Recruiting Council, the Ministry of National Service,the War Office, the Admiralty, and the Air Service. this conference were agreed that it would be fair that any districtwhich provided its quota as laid down by the Ministry of NationalService, should be considered to have fulfilled the conditions set outin Lord French&apos;s Proclamation, and should not be conscribed.Mr. Shortt said that, before any public announcement to this effect could be made, he would have to obtain Cabinet sanction.He added that Lord French was in favour of the proposal now submitted.A letter from Mr. Long, who was unavoidably prevented byillness from attending, was read, in which he expressed his approval of the proposal contained in Mr. Shortfs letter.The Minister of National Service said that, as a result of the proclamation, the whole position in Ireland was difficult. He was,however, more hopeful than he had been a fortnight previously.On the whole, a balance of the difficulties appeared to him to be infavour of the plan proposed by Mr. Shortt.Mr. Shortt said that he was of opinion that if four or five of the ten districts provided their full quota, opposition to conscrip-tion in Ireland would be considerably reduced. Further, he had reason for hoping that the scheme of recruitment by districts would create a new Central Party.Some discussion followed as to whether the scheme wqs likely tomake the introduction of conscription later on, in the event of thatbecoming necessary, more difficult or less difficult, and different views were expressed as to this. The majority of opinion was infavour of adopting the proposal contained in Mr. Shortt&apos;s letter.The War Cabinet decided therefore To sanction the proposal subject to the approval of the PrimeMinister.The Acting Secretary w^as instructed to send a copy of the Minuteon this subject to the Prime Minister the same day, onaccount of the-urgency of the matter.
Supplies to the 7. A.s germane to the preceding subject, Mr. Chamberlain saidUnTtel^St^t s  f      that the Economic Defence and Development Committee, of which m e  k a es o       he was Chairman, had received strong representations confirming theAmerica. &apos; .       p     i . s? .&apos; Jbirst Lord s statement m regard to the effort winch we were makingin clothing and equipping in divers ways a large proportion, of theUnited States Army now operating in France. Mr. Chamberlainpointed out that the United States were making enormous demandshave the effect of releasing a certain amount of British shipbuilding-capacity hypothecated to the Navy.The War Cabinet also took note of the fact that the Board ofAdmiralty were at the present time considering their naval building programme in the light of the existing situation and the Americaneffort already in course of preparation, and that they hoped that itwould be possible to make a further reduction under that head intheir demands upon the shipyards.The War Cabinet, therefore, were of opinion that representa-tions might suitably be made to the United States on the groundthat the British mercantile marine losses during the war in the causeof the Allies had been extremely heavy ; that the British were freelydevoting their merchant ships to the service of the Allies, and verylargely to America, and were incurring grave losses in that service ;that, on account of the geographical position of Great Britain, alarge proportion of the repair work to their own ships in Alliedservice jjarticularly American service -had to be done in british yards to the relief of American. yards, and that as the american naval effort developed in European waters the demands upon GreatBritain for repairs and refits for American ships would increase ; thaton these grounds it would not be unreasonable to ask the UnitedStates Government to consider sympathetically the material replace-ment of British merchant tonnage lost or not able to be replaced bynew construction for the reasons given, having regard to the factthat a very large part of the tonnage of American ships was actuallyon order and under construction on behalf of Great Britain when theUnited States entered the war and has since been taken over by theUnited States; also that it had been found convenient, in thenational interest, to clothe and equip in divers ways a large propor-tion of the United States Army now operating in France, therebyutilising man-power which could otherwise have been devoted toshipbuilding, of which labour was the limiting factor.Sir Leo Chiozza Money said that the Minister of Shipping wasin full accord with the First Lord&apos;s statement of facts. Hethought that, if anything, the First Lord underestimated the rapid increase of the American mercantile marine. It was not improbable that, by 1920 or 1921, if the present conditions continued theUnited States would actually have a bigger mercantile marine than we should have. With reference to the First ,Lord&apos;s point about an adjustment being made between America and this country as regardsthe material replacement of British - merchant tonnage lost in american service, Sir Leo Money said that, in the event of ouracquiring United States vessels, everything depended on the date of transfer. At the present time American prices of ships were about50 per cent, greater than ours. If the vessels could be obtainedimmediately, it would be an advantage to us ; but if the transfer weredelayed until some time after the war, we might stand to lose on the bargain.The War Cabinet decided that A Conference should be held, at the Foreign Office to discuss thepoints raised in the First Lord&apos;s memorandum, and to thisend the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was requestedto invite the attendance of the First Lord of the Admiralty,the Minister of Shipping, and Lord Reading.
Transport Workof big Linersacross the Atlantic.8. The War Cabinet had before them a joint Memorandum bythe First Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister of Shipping,covering a Memorandum by the First Sea Lord in regard to thetransport work of the big liners &quot; Mauretania,&quot; &quot; Aquitania,&quot; and&quot; Olympic &quot; across the Atlantic (Paper G.T.-5345).The First Sea Lord said that he had raised this question because he wished the War Cabinet to realise the fact that these large ships were now incurring somewhat heavier risks, while carrying american troops,. than they had hitherto done, owing to the fact that theenemy now had submarine cruisers operating in the Atlantic. Therisk, therefore, of these ships being torpedoed was extended fromthe areas which were previously considered dangerous to the wholepassage across. Personally he was of opinion that the risk of running the big liners should continue to be taken.Sir Eric geddes said that he had consulted with Sir JosephMaclay on the subject, and, after the most careful consideration, theywere of opinion that the responsibility for continuing to run these ships should be taken. The result of this policy might conceivablymean considerable loss of life if the worst happened. He therefore asked the War Cabinet to confirm the recommendation made tothem.The Wrar Cabinet decided that The big liners in question should continue to be employed forthe conveyance of American troops, as at present.Afaisons deToUrance inFrance.9. With reference to War Cabinet 366, Minute 13, the WarCabinet took note of a Memorandum by the Secretary of State forWar, entitled &quot; Prevention of Venereal Disease in the Army&quot;(Paper G.T.-5296).There was a short discussion of the paper, in the course of whichthe Secretary of State for War drew the attention of the WarCabinet to the importance attached by the French authorities to thisquestion, and to the fears thejr entertained as to the consequences ofthe War Cabinet decision to place Maisons de Tolerance out ofbounds.The Under-Secretary of State for War briefly described theprophylactic efforts made by the British and Dominion Militaryauthorities to combat the disease, and the measures now in opeia-tion. He further informed the Cabinet that a very influentialConference, including representatives of his Department, the[1365-456] Cupon our manufacturing resources at the present time, but as soon asthe war was over the United States&apos; orders for uniforms, &amp;c, would cease. We should have gained no goodwill or trade connections ofany enduring value ; on the contrary, instead of creating new tradechannels, or even keeping old ones open, we should have enabled theUnited States to acquire new business at our expense. As regardsexchange, while it was true that, by manufacturing for the UnitedStates, we were reducing to some extent our indebtedness to thatcountry, it merely meant that we should, as a nation, be rather lessindebted to the United States as a whole, and more indebted to theArgentine and other countries.The War Cabinet decided To invite the attention of the Secretary of State for War andthe Ministry of Munitions to this question, with a view totheir seeing what could be done to induce the United states authorities to supply themselves to a greater extent thanthey were now doing, and to carry their own supplies intheir own ships.
Admiralty, the Dominion and American Forces, and the Churches,had already met on two occasions at the War Office, and that theresult of their deliberations had been noted.Defence of the realm (TakingPossession of premises) Bill.10. The War Cabinet had before them the draft of a Bill toextend the power of taking possession of premises under the Defenceof the Realm Acts (Paper. G.T.-5293).Sir A. Durrani explained that the Bill has been prepared by theParliamentary Draughtsmen at the request of the War CabinetCommittee on Accommodation. The Bill was em extension ofthe Defence of the Realm Acts, and applicable to acquisition only.The War Cabinet decided that The Draft Bill should be submitted to the Secretary of Statefor Home Affairs, who should be asked to scrutinise it, inthe first instance, in case he might think it desirable tobring it before the Committee of Home Affairs.accommodation for theDepartment of overseas Trade.11. With reference to War Cabinet 437, Minute 19, the War-Cabinet had before them a memorandum by Sir A. Steel-Maitland,with a covering-note by Lord Robert Cecil, on the question of accommodation for the Department of Overseas Trade (Paper G.T.-5338). The Paper stated that the Department of Overseas Trade,which was created in the autumn of 1917 as a Joint Department ofthe Board of Trade and the Foreign Office, was at present housed inbuildings in Basinghall Street. The work of the Department was,however, so intimately bound up with that of the parent Depart-inents, and in particular the Foreign Office, that inefficiency and therisk of serious mistakes, apart from much delay and inconvenience,were caused by the separation. The Office of Works had undertaken to erect immediately buildings on the Horse Guards Parade to accommodate the staff, provided the sanction of the War cabinet was obtained. The War Cabinet had sanctioned the proposal (WarCabinet 437, Minute 19), subject to the approval of the war priorities Committee, who, in turn, approved it subject to theconsent, of the Works Construction Sub-Committee. The latter,however, on the ground of shortage of labourmaterial, had declined to give their approval.Genera! Smuts, as Chairman of the War Priorities Committee,explained that, although the Works Construction Sub-Committee ofhis Committee had refused sanction, the matter had not yet beenreconsidered by the &quot;War Priorities Committee. He proposed shortly to call a meeting&apos; of the latter Committee, in order to examine thequestion afresh, and he intended to ask the Assistant Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs to attend the meeting when the matter was discussed.and  of buildingConference ofAllied FoodControllers.12. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFood Controller (Paper G.T.-5343) regarding the Conference ofAllied Food Controllers.Mr. Clynes drew the attention of the War Cabinet to certainResolutions passed, by the Food Controllers, and especiallyResolution No. 2, which called the attention of the Allied Govern-ments to the necessity of -(a.) Facilitating the construction of railway material in all allied countries by allocating the greater number ofmen and a larger quantity of material for this purpose;
(b.) Allocating tonnage for the immediate transport of trucksand locomotives in all countries where they are urgently needed;(c.) The adequate provision of finance for the purpose.Mr. Clynes said that, as the attention of the Departmentsconcerned had already been called to these resolutions, all he desiredwas that the War Cabinet should take note of his memorandum.Mr. Clynes also raised the question of the representation of theDominions on the Committee of Representatives of Food Controllers,and pointed out that, as the question was one of principle, involvingpolitical considerations, he would require to bring the matter beforethe War Cabinet at a later date.Mr. Clynes was requested to keep in touch with the WarCabinet on the subject,(Initialled) A.
