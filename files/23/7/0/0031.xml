Trans-Caucasia. 2. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that an undated telegram had been received on the 2nd September, 1918, from CommodoreNorris, via Baghdad, reporting that the fall of Baku was imminent,and that the details of terms were not known. The local authorities had refused to hand over ships until too late.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he feared thetroOps at Baku were probably lost. These included one battalion,possibly two, and a battery.The Western 1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that, as^ont- far as could he judged from photographs, it would appear that theCanadian and British advance on the previous day had brokenthrough the whole depth of the fortified Drocourt-Queant line. Wehad used seven divisions and about sixty tanks. The originalbreak through was on a front of 4 kilom., and this had now been extended to a breach of 12 kilom. It appeared from the photographsthat there was no further continuous line of defence in front of them,but only a series of broken lines in highly canalised low-lying country.The country immediately to the east of this advance appeared to bemarshy and liable to inundations, and it would seem that this valley,running east and west, would divide the German forces oppositeLens from those operating from Cambrai. The Germans had brought three more divisions out of reserve, leaving only eight freshGerman divisions on the whole Western front. A blow anywhereby the Americans might involve serious consequences for theGermans. Captured documents showed that the Germans were ina bad condition.At a later stage in the meeting a further telephone message was,, received, recounting a further  German  -withdrawal in the Lyssalient, the occupation of the town of Lens, which has never hitherto been in our hands, by British troops, and a further considerable advance astride the old Hindenburg line south of the Cambrai road.The prisoners captured by our troops on the previous day exceeded10,000. It looked as if the Germans were in a very bad way, but itwas very difficult to tell how fast fresh troops could be brought up from the rear to exploit our great success. Field-Marshal sir douglas Haig had begun the movement of the American Corpsformed in the north in General Plumer&apos;s area. The Chief of theImperial General Staff thought that Marshal Foch would adhere tohis original plans, and not effect any serious diversion of troops tothe north. Documents showed that the German Commanders were finding great difficulty in getting their troops to dig, which was thefirst time this had been recorded.The First Lord of the Admiralty stated that the inducementwhich the Germans had hitherto had to hang on to the Flanderscoast was how largely gone, and they might be contemplating a withdrawal to the Antwerp-Brussels line. The reason for this wasthat the short-distance submarines, which had operated in theChannel from Zeebrugge and Ostend, were reduced by more than50 per cent. They were not building any new ones of this type,and. from the German point of view, there was no advantage in thecontinued use of these short-distance submarines over the long-dis-tance submarines that could go northabout. Surface craft operating from Bruges, Zeebrugge, and Ostend had suffered enormous lossessince last March. Their Flanders Flotilla showed a 50 per cent, net loss since that date.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff asked whether therewas any sign of German pressure upon Holland which might result from any contemplated withdrawal to Antwerp.Lord Robert Cecil stated that, so far from there being any sign of pressure upon Holland, the tone of German representationsshowed greater lenience than ever before.
o0H.M.S.&quot; Endymion.&apos;Situation in NorthEussia.Home Defence.3. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that the Senior naval officer, Mudros, reported on the 31st August, 1918, that H.M.S.&quot;Endymion&quot; had been torpedoed whilst at anchor inside the netsat Stavros. The &quot;Endymion&quot; was protected with bulges, and five compartments had been flooded on either side. The ship was still floating on an even keel. The submarine was engaged bybombs and gunfire, and was thought to be damaged.4. With reference to War Cabinet 466, Minute 3, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff referred to telegram No. M. 582, datedthe 2nd September, 1918, from General Maynard, at Murmansk,asking for reinforcements, and stating that it appeared likely thatthe Germans would undertake an early offensive against Murmansk.The General Staff were considering the question as to where themen could be obtained for despatch to Murmansk. If any action was to be taken, it must be taken quickly. There were three possible sources from whence the men could be obtained : (1.) From the 25th Division, now at Aldershot, which wasbeing got ready to proceed to France.(2.) From Ireland.(3.) From Home Defence.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the thirdalternative would be most politic, as he thought, with the improvednaval arrangements in the North Sea, that the risk of a raid uponthe coast was nowr reduced to a minimum. If there was any prospectof the application of compulsory service to Ireland, he would notadvise a reduction of the forces in the Irish Command.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that the presenceof a submarine base at Blyth should protect what the War cabinet were reminded used before the war to be regarded as a likelyobjective of such a German adventure. Sir Eric Geddes added thatthe position of the Admiralty in regard to Home Defence had under-gone no change, that is to say, they could not give any guarantee against a raid.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff then read a letter fromGeneral POole, at Archangel, dated the 12th August, 1918, which showed that he had advanced some 70 miles south from Archangel,and had obtained great quantities of booty, especially machine-gunsand small arms ammunition. 600 Russian recruits had beenObtained in the first week, but there appeared to be a generaldisinclination oh the part of the Russians to fight on either side.The War Cabinet decided that The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should be authorised, ifhe considered it urgently necessary, to withdraw troopseither from the 25th Division (which would then becompleted from Home Defence forces) or divert from HomeDefence, for employment in North Russia.Inferior fr&amp;n in tie 5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that he had25th Division. recently inspected the 25th Division at Aldershot.   Another 4,000infantry were required to complete the division, which was otherwiseready to proceed to France. He had found in that division a numberof unfit men, and he was at a loss to understand how they had been passed by the doctors.The War Cabinet decided that The attention of the Minister of National Service should becalled. to the presence of these inferior  men  in  the&apos; 25th Division, with a view to obtaining from him a reportOn the circumstances in which they had been passed by the doctors.
Albania. 6. The First Lord of the Admiralty drew attention to theReport of the Inter-Allied Naval Council at Versailles, which hadbeen submitted to the Military Representatives at Versailles, inregard to the great importance of preventing the Austrians obtainingpossession of the heights which commanded Valona. If the austrians obtained command of Valona they would be in a positionseriously to interfere with the anti-submarine barrage across theStraits of Otranto. This barrage was already showing its effect in reducing the number of submarine sinkings in the Mediterranean,and it was vital, from a naval point of view, that the efficiency ofthis barrage should be maintained.The War Cabinet requested The Chief of the Imperial General Staff to communicate withour Military Representative at Versailles, in the sense thatthe War Cabinet attach great importance to the retentionof the command of Valona by the Italians.Transport of 7. The Minister of Shipping drew attention to the MemorandumAmerican Troops. by the Firgt Lorc] of the Admiralty (Paper G.T.-5585), and reportedthat the decision of the American War Department not to allow therailing of further American troops through Canada for embarkationin St. Lawrence ports would render useless accommodation for about17,000 troops in British shipping now waiting in the St. Lawrence,and space for a further 27,000 men in British shipping now on theway to the St. Lawrence. He urged that the matter should bedealt with immediately, as, if desired, it might be possible to divertshipping now on passage to Canadian ports to United States ports.The First Lord stated that the Americans had raised every possible objection to the embarkation of American troops inSt. Lawrence ports. We had, however, overcome all these difficultiesby offering rest-camps and providing supplies, clothing, &amp;c.It would seem that the American decision not to allow embarkationof more troops in the St. Lawrence was the result of a deliberatedesire to curtail their programme for the shipment of troops.Lord Miiner held the view that the shipment of american troops from other ports was now so large that it was moreimportant, from the point of view of the Allies, that the shippingnow in the St. Lawrence, or on the way there, should be divertedas soon as possible to other uses.The War Cabinet took note of the fact that the AmericanGovernment declined to make use of the shipping facilities givenby the British shaping authorities, and decided that The shipping allocated for the conveyance of American troops from St. Lawrence ports should be used as the AdmiraltyShipping Ministry find it necessary.8. With reference to War Cabinet 395, Minute 11, the WarGreek Mobilisation. Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor War (Paper G.T.-5477), in regard to the mobilisation of Greece^General Callwell said that the mobilisation of the Greek army was now proceeding in a satisfactory manner, and nine Greekdivisions were already mobilised. The nominal strength of theGreek diAusions was 17,500, but actually the divisions averagedabout 15,000. It was now suggested that the War Cabinet should agree in principle to our undertaking to feed ten divisions with50 per cent, reserves in the Avar zone in place of nine. But it was proposed that, at the same time, the maximum number of troopsthat we could undertake to keep clothed should be fixed at 300,000.The War Cabinet approved of this suggestion.
5WG 468Defence of the realm Acts.Section 40 D.Food Situation at archangel.Womehs Wages inrelation to Men&apos;s.Railwaymen&apos;sWages.The Coal Situation.9. With, reference to War Cabinet 465, Minute 4, in which itwas decided that, subject to the approval of the Prime Minister,a submission should be made to His Majesty to appoint a RoyalCommission to consider Regulation 40 D, the War Cabinet decidedthat Mr. Barnes,Sir George Cave, andLord Robert Cecilshould frame, for the consideration of the Prime Minister,the Terms of Reference of, and suggest the names of.members to serve on, the Royal Commission, havingspecial regard to the desirability of proceeding in thematter as rapidly as possible, and reporting within twomonths.10. With reference to War Cabinet 461, Minute 3, the WarCabinet approved the action taken by Sir Joseph Maclay in autho-rising the provision of tonnage to meet the food situation at archangel, as set out in the memorandum by the Minister ofShipping (Paper G.T.-5523).11. With reference to War Cabinet 463, Minute 8, the WarCabinet took note of the appointment of a Committee &apos;:&apos; To investigate and report upon the relation which shouldbe maintained between the wages of women and men, havingregard to the interests of both, as well as to the value of their work. The recommendations should have in view the necessityof output during the war, and the progress and weU-being ofindustry in the future.&quot;The War Cabinet approved a suggestion made by Mr. Barnes(Paper G.T.-5583) that Sir M. Nathan should be an ex officiomember of the Committee, as well as Secretary.12. With reference to War Cabinet 402, Minute 13, the &quot;WarCabinet had before them a memorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade dealing with fresh demands for increased wages,which had recently been put forward by the Railway Unions(Paper G.T.-5550).&quot;The War Cabinet decided To delegate the matter to Mr. Barnes and Sir Albert Stanley,with power to decide.13. With reference to War Cabinet 467, Minute 2, the WarCabinet had under consideration the notes of a conference held inaccordance with the decision of the War Cabinet on Friday last(Paper G.T.-5582&apos;, a memorandum by the Coal Controller circulatedby the President of the Board of Trade (Paper G.T.-5597), and the notes of a conference held at the Ministry of National Service onthe subject of the release of coal-miners from the Forces(Paper G.T.-5589).The Prime Minister expressed the opinion that the presentoutput of coal could be very largely increased if the miners couldbe induced to realise the gravity of the coal situation. An increaseof 5 per cent, on the present output would mean an increase of12^ million tons produced. From information which had beengiven him, Mr. Lloyd George said that several of the leadingminers&apos; agents were of opinion that the miners could be persuaded
to produce more coal. The Secretary of State for War was naturallyalarmed at the prospect of taking miners away from the army. Itwas undoubtedly a very serious thing to return 50,000 men fromthe Services when there must be a very serious reduction in thestrength of the fighting forces next year. It was well known thatit would be impossible to expect that the reinforcements to theServices for next year would be in any way comparable with thisyear or the year before, and no men should be taken out of theServices unless it was absolutely necessary. If it were possible toarrange a meeting in London of coal-owners, colliery managers, and miners&apos; agents and put the whole case before them, he was convinced that the result of such a meeting would be of thegreatest benefit. In the meantime it was most advisable that, if possible, some of the leading miners&apos; agents shouldbe interviewed in order to ascertain from them their views as to a possible increase of output, but the arrangements forsuch an interview should be made privately, as objections tosuch a proceeding would undoubtedly be taken by the Miners&apos;Federation. It should be realised at the same time that all the fault did not lie with the miners, as he had been told that the mine-owners and colliery proprietors were not taking all the stepspossible towards a maximum output, because of the excess profits tax.The Coal Controller said that the trouble at the presenttime was that the leaders in the mining industry were not leadingthe miners in the right direction. Sir Guy Calthrop quoted asan example the pits of Fifeshire, which was admittedly a very loyalcounty, where the County Miners&apos; Association had now issuedinstructions to picket the pits on Saturdays, so that work couldnot be done on twelve days a fortnight, as had been the customat certain colleries in that district. Sir Guy Calthrop pointedout that he was not asking for 50,000 Grade 1 men, and was prepared to take B 1, but the Minister of National Service and the adjutant-General both agreed that B 1 was a very limited class,in which there were not more than a few thousand miners. Ques-tioned by the Prime Minister as to the extent to which the deficiency in coal wrould be met if 25,000 B men were withdrawn from thearmy, Sir Guy Calthrop said that the employment of these men would be equivalent to about 1\ million tons.The Minister of Munitions said that, in his opinion, it wasimpossible to say what coal would be needed until the policy tobe pursued as regards the war had been decided. It was pro-posed to take these men from the army and use them for bulkproduction. In his opinion it would be far better to take a smaller number of men to be utilised for highly skilled grades of produc-tion, such as gun mechanism, tanks, &amp;c, the contribution of such men towards the war effort next year being far greater. Mr.Churchill said that his department was prepared to make a cuton basic hulk production, and a reduction on the steel output.He had held a meeting with the First Lord of the Admiralty, whohad agreed to consider carefully whether it was not possible toreduce heavy production in order to lighten the demand on coal.His Department had asked for an increase of 5 million tons over theamount of some 80 millions which it had used last year. This extraamount had been asked for in order to produce steel from the newblast furnaces, and it had been hoped that the amount of 10 million tons of steel produced this year would be increased to 12 millionsnext year. In the circumstances he recognised that this extraamount could not be got. Mr. Churchill said that he had come tothe conclusion that, unless it was absolutely necessary, miners shouldnot be withdrawn from the Services.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the conclusions which the Conference over which he presided had arrived at were that the deficiency of 23 million tons could be reduced to 6 million
or 7 million tons if the 5 million tons asked for in addition by theMinistry of Munitions were not granted; if a saving of 3 million tons, owing to the working of the Bruay mines, could be made onthe amount asked for by France and Italy, and if rationing of coal for the industries of this country were decided on. With regard tothe latter point Mr. Bonar Law said that the danger, whichundoubtedly would have to be faced, would be that of increasedlabour trouble, and that, as the effect of this rationing must inevitably mean a considerable amount of unemployment, somescheme for the payment of wages to those out of employment wouldhave to be brought into force.The Minister of National Service expressed the opinion thatthe industrial rationing of coal would have a very serious effect onthe moral of the country unless steps, such as Mr. Bonar Law had suggested, were adopted. At the present moment wages were high,but were being fully spent. If a period of transition were possible,thousands of women could undoubtedly be absorbed in domestic and transport services and the various Worn ens Corps which hadbeen organised, but any sudden cessation of employment wouldhave serious results.(At this stage of the proceedings all those representing thevarious Departments withdrew, with the exception ofMinisters of Departments, the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff, and the Adjutant-General).The Prime Minister pointed out that nothing which theGovernment could do in the way of man-power could possiblyassist in maintaining the same amount of front next year as wewere doing at present. Undoubtedly the American Army wouldtake a large slice of the front now occupied by our troops, and alsoa large portion of that at present occupied by the French troops.The front would also be reduced in another way, the Germanshaving already shortened theirs by their retirement, and con-sequently ours would be shortened equally. The result of this must be that less ammunition would be expended by the british army in France next year.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, while thetotal line might be shorter, the whole fighting line might becomelonger when battles were over a broader and deeper front.Mr. Churchill said that he had been considering whether itwas not justifiable now to use a certain portion of the reservesupply of ammunition. During the battle days of last year anaverage of 43,000 tons a week of ammunition was fired. Duringthis year the average had been 38,000 tons, and it would probably not be greater than that amount during the coming year. It might therefore be possible to allow the reserve of ammunition now instore to fall to two-thirds or one-half of the present amount, but itwould be necessary for the Army to use up the stock now available,and drastically cut down bulk production. If it were decidedto do this, it would be necessary to begin slowing down immediately the making of shell, which would naturally create considerable dis-location in the Labour Department of his Ministry.The Prime Minister said that, with the intimate knowledge hehad of the urgent need of the army for men, he was very reluctant to take a decision to withdraw 50,000 &quot;A&quot; men, or their equivalent,from the Services without a real and genuine effort being made, onthe one hand, to induce the miners to produce more coal, and, onthe other hand, to reduce our consumption. He was in favour of taking risks in cutting down our ammunition reserves, and he pointed out that the organisation would still be in existence, andthat it would be possible to expand again in a very short time shouldthe necessity arise.
soB The War Cabinet deferred further discussion on this question until Friday next, and decided that (a.) The President of the Board of Trade should make private arrangements for as many well-known miners&apos; leaders aspossible to interview the Prime Minister at an early date.(b.) The First Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister ofMunitions should hold a conference and lay before theWar Cabinet their proposals for a substantial reductionin the manufacture of steel and bulk production fortheir respective Departments.The War Cabinet took note of a warning by the President ofthe Board of Trade that even this short delay would necessitate anextension in the application of the scheme of rationing worked outby the Coal Controller under instructions from the War Cabinet(War Cabinet 417, Minute 14).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,September 3, 1918.
