The Director of Military Operations stated that there wasno news from the Western front beyond that contained in the morning&apos;s telegrams.
Leakage of 2. Lord Curzon drew the attention of the War Cabinet to information. certain information with regard to our forces in Baku which had appeared in that morning&apos;s press. Lord Curzon explained that thepublication of this information might have very serious conse-quences. We had only a very small force in Baku, not more than400, and these troops were holding the town with the aid of local forces, the Turks being encamped outside. It was a desperateventure on our part, and was being carried out on the off-chance of keeping the Turks out of Baku. Secrecy was the essence of thesuccess of the operation, and he thought steps should be taken under the Defence of the Realm Act in order to ascertain how theinformation came to be communicated to the press.The Director of Military Operations said that he thought theinformation must haA-e been given at the daily lecture which wasgiven to press representatives at the War Office. He thought thatthe fact that British troops had been in action at Baku was com-municated to the press at yesterday&apos;s lecture.The Director of Military Operations was instructed to ascertainas soon as possible the facts of the case, and to report to- the War Cabinet.3. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to another caseof leakage of information. In this instance the decision of theImperial War Cabinet with regard to the representation of theDominions at Meetings of a permanent Imperial War Cabinet,which had been discussed by the Committee of Prime Ministers theprevious evening, and a form of words for publication agreed to,had appeared in that mornings &quot; Times.&quot;The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Secretary shotdd see personally the Editor of the&quot; Times,&quot; Mr. Geoffrey Dawson, and endeavour to find out from him the source of his information.(6.) Should the Editor of the &quot; Times &quot; decline to say anythingon the matter, then the Defence of the Realm Regulationshould be applied.Submarines. 4. The  First  Sea Lord stated that the U.S.S.  &quot; Dray ton&quot;reported having destroyed or badly damaged a large enemy submarine, 176 miles from Penmarch Point, on the morning of the15th August.Airship Z. 51. 5. The First Sea Lord reported that information had beenreceived from the U.S.S. &quot; Downes &quot; that the Airship Z. 51 had broken adrift and was destroyed.Naval Losses: 0. The First Sea Lord reported that H.M.S. &quot; Ulleswater &quot; and dutch Traffic. H.M.S. &quot; Scott &quot; had been sunk by enemy action on the 15th Augustwhilst screening the West-bound Dutch traffic. The casualties were as follows : H.M.S. &quot; Dlleswater,&quot; 5 missing, 94 survivors ; H.M.S.&quot; Scott..&quot; 22 missing, 156 survivors.The First Sea Lord stated, in this connection, that the Dutchtrade at present consisted almost entirely of prisoners of war parcelsand coal for the prisoners&apos; camps in Holland, and, as a temporary measure, ships carrying corn for the Belgian Relief. The admiralty had always recognised that this traffic was the cause of great risks,and the sinking of the two ships mentioned above proved howjustified the Admiralty had been in their protestations with regardto carrying on this trade. The First Sea Lord pointed out that thetrade had to be very strongly protected by surface craft, as it was open to surface attack from either flank.   It had also to pass through
His Majesty&apos;recent Visit to theFront:Anti-Tank Guns.7. The Prime Minister stated that His Majesty had returned from the front and had called his (the Prime Minister&apos;s) attention toone or two matters in connection with his recent visit. His Majestyhad enquired about the German anti-Tank gun, which appeared tobe a very formidable weapon and was capable of penetrating the tank armour.The Director of Military Operations stated that, as far as he knew, we possessed no weapon of this sort, but he would go intothe question and report to the War Cabinet.Armoured Cars. 8. The Prime Minister stated that His Majesty had also referredto the great success of our armoured cars in the recent operations.These cars had been towed by Tanks across the rough ground, andthen put on to roads. They were able, along these roads, to penetrate far into the German positions, and had in some cases firedinto German Brigade and Divisional Headquarters.The Director of Military Operations stated that the armoured cars had been most valuable, and the War Office was looking intothe question of organising armoured cars to co-operate withTanks. In April or May of this year a certain number of armoured cars detailed for Mesopotamia had been diverted to the western front.United states troops in BritishSector.9. The Prime Minister stated that His Majesty had informed him that he had had a long talk with General Pershing about thedesirability of placing United States troops in the British sector.The King had urged upon General Pershing that this would bedesirable not merely for present reasons but for the future. HisMajesty had impressed upon General Pershing the good results which would follow on a comradeship formed in the line of Britishand United States troops. General Pershing had at first appearedto take this suggestion rather coldly, but afterwards His Majestythought that he had made some impression.Defence of the 10. With reference to War Cabinet 455, Minute 17, the WarBealm Acts: Cabinet had &apos; before them a memorandum by Mr. Barnes (PaperSection 40 D. G.T.-5216), and Minute 1 of the Seventh Meeting of the Committeeof Home Affairs, with regard to Section 40 (d) of the Defence of the realm Act.The War Cabinet had a short discussion on the subject, but ina declared mine area, for which purpose six sweepers had to accompany it. It was also open to attack from submarines, andthere was&quot; little doubt that the &quot; Ulleswater &quot; and the &quot; Scott &quot; hadbeen sunk by submarines. The First Sea Lord suggested that itwas a consideration whether negotiations could not be opened withjl the enemy with a view to the parcels for interned prisoners of warbeing conveyed by cartel ships, or ships which are used for there patriation of prisoners, and he suggested that the question shouldbe taken up by the Admiralty and the Foreign Office.The War Cabinet decided that Representatives of the Admiralty and the Foreign Office should go into the question and endeavour to arrive at an agreement.Should any point arise on which an agreement could notbe reached, then it might be referred to the War cabinet for decision.
view of the absence of the Home Secretary and the Deputy Secretaryof State for War, it was decided to adjourn the discussion.The Secretary was instructed that, when the item was againplaced on the agenda, he should ensure that the HomeSecretary, the Colonial Secretary, the Deputy Secretary ofState for War, Sir Edward Kemp, representatives of theDominions, and an American officer should be present.Norwegian 11. With reference to Imperial War Cabinet 29, Minute 11, theTerritorial Waters. War Cabinet had before them a draft telegram to Sir M. Findlayfrom the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in regard to thebarring of Norwegian waters to submarines.The First Sea Lord said that there was a gap in the barrage atthe Eastern end of the minefield through which there was evidencethat enemy submarines were entering the North Sea. The measures for patrolling which the Norwegian Government proposed to under-take were, according to the experience of the British Admiralty,quite inadequate for the purpose of preventing submarines fromgetting through the gap.The view was expressed that it would be necessary to impress on the Norwegian Government that the mining of norwegian territorial waters was the only effective method to prevent thepassage of submarines. It was recognised, however, that the situa-tion was delicate and difficult, and it would be undesirable topresent an ultimatum to the Norwegian Government insisting that,unless the work of mining were carried out by a definite date, theBritish Government would proceed to mine the gap.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed out that theNorwegian Government might very possibly reply in the sense thatit was unreasonable fpr His Majesty&apos;s Government to insist on the gap at the Eastern end of the minefield being closed if they permittedthe Westerly gap of about 30 miles to remain open.The First Sea Lord agreed that if the Norwegian gap wereblocked, we must be prepared to close the Westerly gap also.Lord Robert Cecil said it was important to carry the UnitedStates Government with us in the step which we were taking, andin this connection it was suggested that the work of mining theEastern end of the minefield might be performed by the Americans,in order that the United States Government might take their shareof the political responsibilities in the matter.The First Sea Lord pointed out, however, that there weretechnical reasons why the work of mining at this part of the mine-field bad better be performed by the British Navy.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs asked what he shouldtell Sir M. Findlay with regard to our rendering assistance to norway in the event of Germany declaring war upon her on accountof closing the gap ?Lord Robert Cecil said that this matter had been consideredpreviously by the Northern Neutrals Committee, Avho had foundthat it would be impossible to render any assistance to Norwayexcept in the matter of aircraft and anti-aircraft guns.The War Cabinet decided that-The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in his message toSir M. Findlay, should indicate that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would insist on the Eastern gap being stopped,either by a system of patrols or mines. If the measures for patrolling could not be &apos; shown to be efficient, then it.would be necessary to mine the gap. If, at the end of areasonable period, the Admiralty advised His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that the measures taken by the norwegian government were inadequate to prevent the passage of submarines, His Majesty&apos;s Government would have no
other alternative but to take action themselves. If thestopping of the gap caused Germany to declare war onNorway, His Majesty&apos;s Government would render as muchassistance as they could to the Norwegian Government by sending aircraft and anti-aircraft guns.The Coal Situation 12. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCoal Controller, with a note by Sir Albert Stanley (Paper G.T.-5410),together with a memorandum by the Admiralty (Paper G.T.-5416),and a memorandum by Mr. Leverton Harris (Paper G.T.-54T8), inregard to the present coal situation.Sir Albert Stanley said that, while the Board of Trade memoran-dum disclosed a very serious position, the situation had become evenmore acute since the memorandum was prepared, owing to increased demands all round from different Departments. The Ministry ofMunitions, for instance, asked for an additional 5,000,000 tons, and increased demands had also been received from the &quot;United states army during the last few days. The output of coal during July,1918, had been less than the output of the corresponding month ofthe previous year by 3,300,000 tons, i.e., if July be reckoned as afair criterion, a decrease at the rate of 40,000,000 tons for the year.July, however, could not be regarded as a fair criterion, owing tothe part which the epidemic of influenza had played in the collieries.The deficit altogether amounted&apos; to 18,000,000 tons, and, while somecomparatively small economies in industrial consumption might bemade to set against this huge deficit, no further reduction in house-hold consumption could be contemplated. Sir Albert Stanley said he was advised that it was hopeless to expect the deficit to be made good by increased output on the part of the miners. A greatereffort might lead to some, but not to a substantial, increase. Theresult of their effort in any case must be regarded as an unknownfactor. There therefore appeared to be no alternative but to askfor the return of 25,000 Grade I men, and the remainder of the25,000 low-category miners, to be returned to the mines no later than the 30th September, 1918.The Minister of Shipping said that the shortage of coal had themost serious effects on shipping organisation. Ninety vessels werewaiting in Welsh ports for coal, and there was another flotillawaiting on the East Coast.The Adjutant-General said that it had been agreed that 25,000low-category men in the Home Forces should be discharged fromthe Army to the mines. So far, 8,588 had been released from theArmy. The rate of release at present was about 400 men a week.This rate would have been increased but for the fact that the miners&apos;organisation and machinery for placing the men could not deal witha more rapid stream of men from the Army. There were nowremaining about 11,000 miners in B.2 and lower categories, ofwhich between 3,000 and 4,000 were post-war miners, whose returnto the mines would be certain to lead to friction. There were, there-fore, only 8,000 pre-war miners who could be obtained from theArmy, and these he was prepared to release as fast as the coal controller could use them. With, the 8,588 men already released,this would yield a total of about 17,000 out of the 25,000 promised.With regard to the higher categories, it, must be remembered thatB.1 men to-day were as valuable to the Army as A men.Sir Guy Calthrop said that measures had already been concertedwith the War Office for the more rapid return of the balance ofthe lower grade men.The Minister of National Service said that there were not many more miners who could be taken from the Army except A.1 men, andit would not be fair to take the young Grade I miners, who had notbeen overseas, without recalling the older men. The Admiralty hadreceived a big share of recruits for stokers from the mines during
this year. From information which he had received from a numberof sources, he was convinced that a large part of the reduction in output was deliberate, and was due to pacifist influences amongcertain sections of the miners. Pie was therefore afraid that, evenif more men were returned from the army, the only result would beto increase this deliberate restriction of output on the part of thepacifist elements. In reply to a question, Sir Auckland Geddesstated that it was only in quite exceptional circumstances, in one ortwo areas, that a few miners were still being recruited.After some discussion the War Cabinet decided that The question of releasing further men from the army should be adjourned pending the receipt of a report from theCommittee mentioned in Minute 13.Committee on Coal 13. The Prime Minister called attention to the desirability, with production. a view to increasing the output of coal, of appointing in the CoalControllers Department a person or persons thoroughly acquainted with the mining industry, who should be responsible for coal production as distinguished from coal distribution.Sir Albert Stanley said that he had discussed the matter withleading coalowners, and the only substantial suggestion which theywere able to put forward for improving the coal output was therecall of miners from the army. It had to be borne in mind thatthere were already in existence District Committees covering thecoalfield, which advised the Coal Controller.Sir Joseph Maclay, speaking in the light of experiences at theMinistry of Shipping, said that what was required was a small bodyof the ablest men in the mining industry who would sit daily inLondon in close contact with the Coal Controller. This body ofadvisers should be in a position to review the whole situation day by day, and should be made to feel a direct responsibility for theproduction of coal.The War Cabinet were generally agreed that, with a view toany subsequent representations which it might be necessary tomake to the Allies, it was important that the Cabinet should havebehind them the support of a body of mining experts.The War Cabinet decided To ask the President of the Board of Trade to set up apermanent Committee of three men who should beresponsible for coal production under the Coal Controller.) 2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.August 16, 1918.
