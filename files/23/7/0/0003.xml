WITH reference to War Cabinet 437, Minute 18, the WarWaSes- Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministry of Labour,on the application of the war wage, granted to miners in collieries,to members of the Miners&apos; Federation in munitions industries(Paper G.T.-5006).Sir David Shackleton, in the absence of the Minister of Labour,stated that the decision of the War Cabinet was required on theclaim made by the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain that a war wage, on the same terms as had been conceded to the Federation byHis Majesty&apos;s Government, should be paid to all members of theFederation engaged in those industries in which the Ministry ofMunitions was concerned. The claim raised two very serious difficulties : (a.) A number of the employers affected were engaged on private work outside Government control, and the properand usual course wotild be for the Miners&apos; Federation todeal directly with such employers.(6.) The Committee on Production had recently heard a claim for an advance in wages in the clay industries as a whole.
The claim was presented by all the Unions concerned inthe industries except the Miners&apos; Federation, and was based on an agreement such as that existing in theengineering and other trades, for a revision of wagesevery four months. The latest revision had taken place as recently as 28th -June, and the Committee on Pro-duction had then granted an advance not exceeding 8s.,included in a war bonus maximum of 25s., which brought the advance roughly up to that obtained by the railway-men.The Miners&apos; Federation controlled only a small proportion ofthe men in the clay industries, and was in frequent conflict with thetrades unions to which the majority of the workers belonged. Hehad met the Miners&apos; Executive, and had found them very impatientof any delay in arriving at settlement. He had pointed out to them the unreasonableness of expecting the Government either to subsidiseprivate employers, a course which would be involved, or to set asidea recent award of the Committee on Production. The Minister ofMunitions was to meet the Executive of the Miners&apos; Federation that afternoon. It was important, therefore, that the Cabinet should decide whether or not they were prepared to face a strike in theevent of the Miners&apos; Federation being unwilling to accept theproposals of the Minister of Munitions, as set forth in the Statementattached to Paper G.T.-5006. In his own (Sir David&apos;s) view, therequest to extend the miners&apos; advance to clay workers and to thecoke-oven workers without modification was an unreasonabledemand, and a distinct stand should be made against such a con-cessioh. On the other hand, he was bound to point out that, incase&quot; Of a strike, the miners would fight tenaciously against anyrecognition of the principle of arbitration, to which they would always render strenuous opposition.Sir Stephenson Kent said he concurred generally with the viewsset forth by Sir David Shackleton. The demand nOw put forward by the Miners&apos; Federation practically amounted to a demand that asmall proportion of workers, representing 5 per cent, of the whole,should determine the wage advances of the remaining 95 per cent.The gradations between the trades glided so imperceptibly into one another that to grant the demand would start afresh cycle of appealsfor wage advances. Further, it would be a very serious departure to begin subsidising private employers ; moreover, he deprecated theidea of ignoring any award by the Committee on Production. Hesuggested that the negotiations that afternoon should be conducted on the lines indicated in the proposals of the Minister of Munitions,and that, if it were so apparent that the negotiations were about tobreak down, and that a strike was threatened, they should have theauthority of the Cabinet to g;rant the concessions demanded.Sir David Shackleton pointed out that the Miners&apos; executive had informed him that the demand of the Federation had, in fact,been conceded by the Prime Minister at their interview with him onFriday last, and that only the details of the arrangement remained to be settled.Sir Albert Stanley said that, at the interview with the PrimeMinister, the discussion was confined to the coalfield, and did notembrace other industries.^ Sir Guy Caithrop confirmed this, but added that, while nodistinction was drawn by the men between the coal and otherindustries, they made it clear that they were asking for an advancecorresponding to that obtained by them last September.The War Cabinet were impressed with the great seriousness offacing a strike of the miners at the present juncture and with thefact that the arrangements concluded on Friday last had beeninterpreted as conceding the advanee to the ntambers of the MineFsFederation generally, without any restriction as to the industry inwhich they were employed.
The War Cabinet authorised The Minister of Munitions to conduct the negotiations on thelines indicated in the Statement (Paper G.T.-5006) ;failing a settlement on these lines, to endeavour to delay the negotiations pending the return of the Prime Minister;but if an immediate strike appeared to be inevitable, then the concessions asked for should be granted.Death of Lord 2. The War Cabinet heard with regret of the decease of LordEhondda. Rhondda, Food Controller, and directed The Acting-Secretary to convey to Lady Rhondda, on behalf ofthe War Cabinet, an expression of their deep sympathy,and their warm appreciation of Lord Rhondda&apos;s great and successful service in a very difficult office.(Initialled) A.
