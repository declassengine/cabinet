THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he had nothing further to tell the War Cabinet beyond what had appeared in the latest telegrams. The number of German divisions on theWestern front was decreasing ; they now mrmbered 197 so far as our information went. There swas a net decrease of ten divisions in the whole German army. It seemed unlikely that the germans could dispose of fresh reinforcements until the 1920 class were placed in the ranks. The men in this class, at the end of thepresent year, would average 18J years of age. The Germans had put their 1918 class into the line at that age, and, as the result oftheir experience, kept back the 1919 class. should, however, theenemy decide in the near future to bring in the 1920 class this autumn, it would mean that they were in very serious straits asregards man-power.General Wilson stated that our troops had now crossed the Sonrmein places, and the Nord Canal. There was no water in the Canal,and it could not form mOre than a temporary line of resistance.Opposite General Mangin, the enemy resistance was stiffening, but
it was more than probable that the enemy would decide to make a real stand on the Hindenbtirg line. So far, four Austrian divisions had been identified on the Western front, two in the line, and two atArlon. These had no corps headquarters, and were apparentlysent up as independent units for the purpose of reinforcement.The number of reserve divisions fit to go into the line was 14, ofwhich 2 were in Prince Rupprecht&apos;s army, 2 belonged to Von Boehn,5 to the Crown Prince, 4 to Prince Albrecht, and 1 was not located.Allusion was made to an announcement which had appeared insome of the French newspapers to the effect that the american army was about, to carry out a big stroke in France. It was sug-gested. that if Marshal Foch had any such intention, its premature disclosure was most unfortunate.Trans-Caucasia. 2, The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the latestnews from Baku was rather disquieting. (hi the 26th instantabout 600 Turks, with 7 guns, had attacked a section of the line,held by the North Staffordshires, with determination and chargedwith bayonets, forcing our men back after a gallant resistance.Our casualties amounted to 10 officers and 100 men, approximately.A. telegram had also been received the previous day from theCommanderdn-Chief in India, stating that, so far as his informationwent, there was a steady increase in Turkish strength in front ofBaku, and it was possible that the Turks intended to advance fromTabriz eastward, either now or on completion of the collection ofsupplies apparently at present in progress. The telegram said thata recent message from General Dunsterville disclosed the futility&apos;and risk of endeavouring to manage by agreement the discordantand suspicious elements in the Central Caspian Government, and pointed out that the force at General Dunsterville&apos;s disposal wasdangerously small. The Commander-in-Chief suggested that thetime had now arrived for General Dunsterville to receive definiteorders to use force, if necessary, in order to seize the Caspian fleet and all other shipping that he could collect, and to do the utmost possible damage to the port and to the oilfields. General Wilsonpointed out that, although General Marshall had plenty oftroops in Mesopotamia which he could send to General Dunster-ville&apos;s support, the transport difficulties were at present insuperable.We had placed an order (War Cabinet 455, Minute 6) with theAmerican Government for 1,300 Ford cars to be sent to Meso-potamia, but this order had not been accepted. He thought it possible that lie might be able to provide 200 other cars fromEnglandMr. Chamberlain suggested that, as a temporary expedient, acertain number of tractors, which had been ordered by the FoodProduction Department, might be diverted for this purpose if that department had not been able to take delivery yet.The War Cabinet requested The Secretary of State for War to take up the  question inconsultation with the MiiSSaapSlSlfflEa, %trtL (^cUe ^*,Situation in North 3. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum from the-Russia- Director of Military Operations to the Secretary of the.War Cabinet(Paper G.T.-5527), covering telegram No. 855, dated the 26th August,1918, from the Rear-Admiral, White Sea, Murmansk, to the Admiralty.The telegram stated that, in the Rear-Admirars opinion, the militarysituation both at Murmansk and Archangel would be very seriousunless considerable reinforcements, in excess of those already detailed,were sent before the end of October. With regard to the Murmanskforces, the present intention was to withdraw all troops from thesouth of Kandalaksha, and also from Petchenga.   The Rear-Admiral
considered such withdrawals would be politically disastrous, and, inorder to obviate this necessity, he asked for a further reinforcement of 0,000 troops.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the news fromMurmansk was not good. General Maynard, who had a considerablereputation as a fine fighting officer, and in whom the War Office had great confidence, was inclined to give up Petchenga, which, mighthave certain political results.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the Admiraltyproposed to replace LT.M.S. &quot; Oochrane,&quot; at Murmansk, by theRussian ship &quot; Askolcl.&quot; He thought that General Maynard wasunder some misapprehension as to the purposes for which the&quot; Cochrane &quot; and other ships had been sent to that theatre. these purposes had been clearly explained to General Poole, butthey were not realised by General Maynard. It was important that,before the ice set in, various ships should be withdrawn, either forrefitting or because, for structural reasons, they could not withstandice pressure. Every ship we kept in those waters involved a greatloss of economy in coal, transport, &amp;c. It was a great waste of man-power to keep the men of the &quot;Cochrane&quot; so long onshore. Fie wished, further, to point out that the situation hadconsiderably developed in the last two months. Our North Seabarrage had proved much more efficient than we had anticipated,and its moral and actual effect was increasing. This would all be lost to us if we had to abandon the Arctic ports.The First Sea Lord explained that, if the Germans were to prolong their railway, they would be able to start new sea bases forsubmarines, as well as for surface raiders.After some discussion as to whether, should such a course proveinevitable, it would be preferable to relinquish Archangel orMurmansk and Petchenga, the Chief of the Imperial General staff pointed out that our effort in that theatre was based on theassumption that we should obtain the support of about 20,000Czecho-Slovaks.   This project, unfortunately, had not materialised.The First Lord explained that if we lost both Petchenga and murmansk, the fall of Archangel was bound to follow, as the enemycould then open a submarine base and operate against our flank.The Secretary reminded the War Cabinet that the question ofour operations in the White Sea was now engaging the attention ofthe Military Representatives of the Supreme War Council.The AVar Cabinet agreed that it was very important thatreinforcements should be sent to the White Sea ports, if this couldbe done without prejudice to the present offensive on the western front, and directed The Chief of the Imperial General Staff to examine the question,and to report to them at an early date : -----(a.) The number of reinforcements necessary to maintain our hold on the ports,(b.) AATietker   these    reinforcements    could    be   madeavailable.Norwegian Terri- 4. AVith reference to War Cabinet 4G2, Minute 6, the First Seatorial Waters. Lord again pressed the importance of arriving at an early decision in regard to the mining of Norwegian territorial waters, as thesituation had now reached an acutely critical stage.The War Cabinet agreed that the decision to be taken was oneof great importance, in view of the present reluctance of theUnited States to participate in our proposed action, and decidedthat The matter should be brought before them at the earliest opportunity when the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairscould be present.
Naval Effort of 5. In continuation of War Cabinet 456, Minute 6, the FirstGreat Britain and Lord of the Admiralty stated that his views in the matter of thethe United States naval effort of Great Britain, and the United States of Americaof America. jlacj \)eeil amplified in his Papers G.T.-5494 and 5508.   In a noteby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Paper G.T.-5521)it -was recommended that the question of the adjustment of the shipbuilding programme (so that the ratio of merchant-ship con-struction to warship construction should be the same in both countries) should be examined by the First Lord andMr. Roosevelt, but he (Sir Eric Geddes) had ascertained thatMr. Roosevelt had no powers as regards the allocation of naval ships.He therefore suggested that it would be of advantage if he discussed-cussed the matter with the naval authorities in America, andmentioned that the Board of Admiralty had drawn urj a schemeof naval allocation of the two forces, which, if agreed to by theUnited States authorities, would enable the Admiralty to adopta programme of naval construction resulting in the release fromnaval yards, for transfer to merchant shipbuilding, of some20,000 largely skilled and partially skilled men. Sir Eric Geddesconsidered that the question of adjustment of merchant shipsbetween the Americans and ourselves should, as far as possible,he dealt with separately.Lord Reading was of fopinion that although the naval yardsin the United States were separately organised to the mercantileyards, yet, owing to the dependence of both on the output ofsteel, engines, &amp;c, it would be impossible to confine any such discussion to naval shipbuilding. He added that steps were being-taken with a view to persuading Mr. Hurley to visit this countryto discuss the merchant shipbuilding situation.Reference was made to the fact that France was now inclined to support our case re shipping against America, which indicated that negotiations on this side of the water would be conducted in a better atmosphere, as far as we were concerned.It was also mentioned that the situation in America as regardsshipbuilding was different from what prevailed in this country, inso far as in America the mercantile marine had the first call on the shipbuilding resources of the States, whereas in England the navalneeds of the countiy were given the chief consideration, and, conse-quently, the first step was to convert Mr. Hurley to our point ofview.Sir Eric Geddes said that his information did not confirm thisview, he, however, stated that the output of the United states naval yards, as forecasted, was considered by the United states authorities as ample, under existing conditions, and that it was theallocation of the ships that were turned out that was the point he wished to settle.The War Cabinet decided To defer further discussion on the First Lord&apos;s proposal until it had been ascertained whether Mr. Hurley would acceptthe invitation to come to England.Sou1 oil6 6.. The War Cabinet agreed that, in view of the Prime Ministers0UUC1&quot; political  engagements, the  next  meeting of the Supreme  WarCouncil (except in case of great emergency), should not be held before the third or fourth week in September.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,August 30, 1918.
