2Battle Situation : 1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, according-German Attack. to the most recent information received, 26 German infantry divisions and 1 cavalry division had so far been identified on thefront of attack. Included in the 26 infantry divisions were 9belonging to Prince Rupprecht&apos;s reserve and 12 from the crown prince&apos;s reserve. So far only 5 of the divisions lying in the linehad been identified, which looked as if the divisions holding theline had not taken part in the attack, but that the attacking divisions had passed through them, which tended to confirm the view recentlyformed that only inferior divisions were employed to hold the line.Of the 26 divisions thrown into the attack, 12 were east and 14west of Rheims. Of the 9 from Prince Rupprecht&apos;s reserve, 2had come from Flanders, 1 one from Lille, 3 from the neighbozxr-hood of Douai, and 3 from the vicinity of Peronne. PrinceRupprecht has still 33 divisions and the Crown Prince 14 divisions in reserve.On our side the French seemed to have 39 divisions in action,including &apos;1 Italian and 5 American divisions. There was no information at present to show how many American divisions had sofar been in action, but it was known that 5 were within reach of the battlefield.A rather curious fact was that of the 9 divisions of PrinceRupprecht&apos;s reserve 6 were east of Rheims where the attack hadnot made much progress. This lack of progi-ess looked as if the attack on that side was not intended to be a very serious one ; butif this were the case it was difficult to account for the presence ofthe 6 divisions of Prince Rupprecht&apos;s reserve in that area.The latest news was the fact that the enemy had takenBeaumont, east of Sillery. It was impossible yet to determine whether this offensive was the great attack of the year. If it were,the situation so far was quite satisfactory. General Wilson saidthat there was nothing special to report in any other theatre of war.Submarines. 2. The Deputy First Sea Lord said that a report had beenreceived from Alexandria that the British steamship &quot; Waitemata &quot;and the French steamship &quot; Djemnah,&quot; the latter carrying troops,had been sunk by torpedo on the 14th July between Crete and the african coast. In the French ship great loss of life was reported.Admiral Rope further stated that the steamship &quot; Barunga,&quot; out-ward bound in company with IT.M.S. &quot; Kent &quot; and three destroyers,had been torpedoed south-west of the Scilly Islands. Over 800Australian convalescents were on board the &quot; Barunga,&quot; but all hadbeen transferred to the destroyers.Publication of details of BritishEffort in France.3. With reference to War Cabinet 445, Minute S, attention was drawn to the fact that Mr. Arnold Bennett was in charge of theFrench section at the Ministry of Intormation, and that if he had any suggestions or enquiries to make these should be addressed tothe Minister under whom he was serving, and not take the form ofa letter to the public press.The Secretary was instructed to draw the attention of theMinister of Information to Mr. Arnold Beimett&apos;s indiscretion.Vladivostock:General Knox&apos;mission.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said, that he had just received a telegram from Lord Reading, stating that he depre-cated General Knox going through America, for reasons which weregiven in the telegram. Mr. Balfour said that he would be veryloath to override the advice of Lord Lieading, particularly&apos; in regardto the personnel of missions or individuals we might send to the
United States. He thought Lord, Heading should be given thepower of voice in declaring our policy in that direction. GeneralKnox was being sent by the War Office to Siberia, and his quickestroute was through the United States of America. At first sightthere appeared to be no objection to his taking this route. Onthe other hand, the fact that he was. going would be known to the americans, who would wish to know the reason of his mission. Hewas not going to command any troops at Vladivostock, because we had only 1,000 men there, and it was not a General Officerscommand, also it was unlikely that we should have more. TheWar Office proposed to send him as military attache with some-what special and extended, powers. Although General Knox wasnot a reactionary as the term was understood by the Members ofthe Cabinet, there was no doubt that he was anti-Bolshevik, while a man of his strength of character, knowledge, and ability was bound sooner or later to play a political part. Moreover, it was practically impossible for anybody to go to Russia, whether in anofficial position or not, without becoming mixed up with her internalpolitics and her political parties, which were so closely bound up with the military situation. Mr. Balfour was afraid that the americans would suspect General Knox of intending to take areactionary line and of attempting to revive the ancien regime. Thepoint was whether General Knox could take another route, thusavoiding the United States, or whether Lord Reading should beoverridden, or whether someone else less capable and morecolourless than General Knox should be chosen.Lord Robert Cecil said the intention was that the selectedmilitary officer should go to Siberia on by to take charge of our military interests there. The nature and importance of the missionwere such as to reqiiire a really good man. The question was, who should be sent ? Everything seemed to point to General Knoxbeing the right man. fie knew the Russian language thoroughly,and his judgment and forecasts in the past had almost, without exception, proved correct, e.g., the case of Kerensky, the Bolsheviks,the state of the Russian army, and so on. iSTo doubt he would find it difficult to avoid politics, but he woidd be a most useful liaison with the Russian troops in that area. What we wanted was thatfriendly elements among the Russian troops should be collected and formed into an army. General Knox was more competent to assist in effecting this than any other Englishman that he could name.The view of the Cabinet was that it was undesirable thatGeneral Knox should go to Washington, although it might beimpossible for him to avoid crossing American territory on his wayto Siberia. General Knox was associated with the old regime, suchas General Alexieff and others. President Wilson seemed inclined to believe that the Conservative elements in England were just as keen now to revive the old regime in Russia as they were earlyin the nineteenth century to restore it in France, and also feared that our intention in going to Russia was not so much to defeat the Germans as to crush the revolution..It was generally agreed. that it was important that GeneralKnox should proceed to Siberia, and that he should start at once,but that it would be difficult for him to avoid crossing Americanterritory wuthout involving great delay-.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To authorise the War Office to instruct General Knox toproceed to Vladivostock at once, cautioning him at thesame time npt to go to Washington, but to proceed asunostentatiously as possible, and in no circumstances togrant any interviews while on the way.(5.) That the Foreign Office should send to Lord Reading a carefully worded reply, pointing out that General Knoxhad very exceptional qualifications for the post for which[1365-446] B 2
he had been selected, which was that of the head of aMilitary Mission attached to - the Headquarters of thefuture Allied Commander-in-Chief in Siberia.The 54th Division. 5. The Secretary of State for War raised the question of thetransfer of the 54th Division from Palestine to the Western front.He stated that some time ago it had been decided on the advice ofthe Chief of the Imperial General Staff to bring this division to France,- but at a later date action was postponed owing to a change in thesituation. The views of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff,who was away at the time the decision was arrived at, could not beobtained.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that in hisopinion, when given at the end of last month, it would have been agood thing to bring the 54th Division and the Australian MountedDivision to France had action been taken at that time. In that casethe Australian Division would have been in France on the 17th july and the 54th Division on the 21st July. The Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff was of opinion that it was now too late to order the54th Division to the Western front, as it would be at least six weeks before it could arrive there.The War Cabinet decided To leave both the 54th Division and the Australian MountedDivision under the orders of General Allenby for thepresent.Preferences on 6. With reference to War Cabinet 444, Minute 14, the WarDutiable Articles. Cabinet had before them the report of the Committee on the trade relations of the United Kingdom within the Empire on the subjectof Preferences on Dutiable Articles (G.T.-4903), together with amemorandum by Mr. Walter Long on the subject (G.T.-5057).Mr. Long explained that the question now arose as to whetherthe series of resolutions of the Committee should be announced tothe public as the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government. It was sug-gested that the second part of the Committee&apos;s Report, which referredto preferences to the AJlies, might, if published, commit the Govern-ment to a line of policy the consequences of which could not before seen at the moment. Mr. Long explained that he was not responsible for the second part of the Committee&apos;s Report. Thiswas put forward by the Foreign Office on behalf of the Allies. all he asked for was that Part 1 (Preferences to the Empire) should be announced as the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The ForeignOffice would deal with the remainder.The War Cabinet approved Part 1, but decided to adjourn thediscussion, in order to have Lord Robert Cecil present.ManrPower: 7. With reference to War Cabinet 415, Minute 15, the MinisterMobility of Muni- 0f Munitions called the attention of the War Cabinet to serioustions Labour. labour disturbances which were threatened in Coventry, Manchester,and other engineering centres in connection with the working outby the Ministry of the War Munition Volunteer Scheme. in coventry the shop stewards had taken exception to the embargowhich had been laid on certain firms, which prevented themrecruiting further skilled men. There was only a limited amountof skilled labour in the country, and it was essential, if dilution wasto be extended, to have-the power to move men from where theycould be spared to where they were urgently needed. This policy had been ^ approved by the War Cabinet on the 23rd May, and announced on the 8th June. In consequence, certain firms whichwere either unwilling to proceed with dilution or had a surplusof skilled men, had been told that they must desist from taking
on additional skilled men. These firms had complied withthe Ministry&apos;s request, whereupon the shop stewards threatened to strike unless the Ministry dropped its policy. They had,in fact, that morning tendered a week&apos;s notice in Coventryand Manchester. The position was one which the Governmentcould not possibly tolerate, and it was essential that he (Mr.Churchill) should be authorised to deal vigorously with thesituation should a strike take place. He had prepared a draft statement indicating the policy which he thought the War cabinet should endorse. (Mr. Churchill read the draft.) He wished to be free to proceed against persons conspiring against the State, and towithdraw from them the protection, which they now enjoyed, fromrecruitment for the Army. He agreed that it would be an illegitimateuse of the Military Service Acts to compel workmen to put up with industrial conditions against which they were striking in the ordinary way, but this was not an ordinary dispute between capital and labour.It was absurd to comb out men from workshops for the Army andto allow others to walk out of the shops and remain immune whileengaged on a strike of the kind now contemplated. He thought the present, a good occasion on which to enforce the principle thatif a man refused to do the special skilled work for which he wasprotected, he should be conscripted if fit to light. He reminded theWar Cabinet that on the 15th August, 1917, when the Munitions ofWar Bill was before the House of Commons and when LeavingCertificates were abolished, he had made it plain that the Ministryintended to use the Defence of the Realm Act to prevent poachingby employers of fluid labour.    (Hansard, Vol. 97, No. 117.)Mr. Chamberlain said that, according to his recollection in thenegotiations which had been carried on with the amalgamated society of Engineers and other Unions, by the Man-Power Committeeon which he had served, it had been clearly understood, whenexemptions were granted, that if the men ceased to be engaged onthe special manufacturing work for which they had been protected,they wordd be liable to army service.Mr. Roberts was of opinion that the policy laid down by theWar Cabinet should be carried out, and an attempt should be madeto secure the co-operation of the loyal section the great majority of the workmen. Mr. Barnes, who was also a member of theCommittee, confirmed Mr. Chamberlain&apos;s recollection. There hadundoubtedly been some misunderstanding, and some of the men&apos;sleaders contended that if greater trouble had been taken to define the Governments policy, they would have even got it accepted or have held the men in check. The men complained that they werenot fully consulted or adequately informed. Plowever, as noticeshad only been handed in that day, there was a week during whichattempts might, be made to secure a peaceful settlement. He was anxious that the announcement made by the Minister of Munitionsshould be in the nature of a warning rather than of a threat.Sir David Shackleton said that since the Conference of theMinistrv of Munitions with the Trade Union Advisory committee at which the policy of the Ministry had been approved, certainmischievous influences had been at work which had undoubtedlyweakened the attitude of the Committee. It might be true that the shop stewards did not fully know the case for the Government, butit was difficult to reach them all. In reply to a question, Sir Davidpointed out that the strike at Coventry would be a legal strike, andit would not be possible to arrest the Union funds.Lord Weir said that there still appeared to be a lack of appreciation of the effect, of the comb-out and the clean-cut, andthat the only hope was to develop dilution. It was necessary toget into the minds of the workmen that the remaining skilled menwere to be regarded not so much in the light of producers as of teachers of new labour. Twelve months hence much of the workwhich was now being done by skilled labour would be done byunskilled labour.
Sir Auckland pointed out that the position at present withregard to strikes,was that if a man struck on economic grounds, itneither improved nor diminished his protection. If, as seemed probable in the present temper of labour, there was a widespreadstrike, it would be physically impossible to conscript the thousands of men affected, while, if it were possible, it would have the effectof stopping output. He was, however, clear that as the threatenedstrike was one against recruiting, it should not be tolerated. At thesame time he, did not think it would be wise to announce in advance that every man on strike would be recruited. considerable difficulties were being experienced with the miners, who wereopposing further recruitment by reducing output, and from farmers,especially in Wales, who were endangering,&apos; the harvest.Sir Stephenson Kent urged that the Munition Volunteer schemewas absolutely vital in order to maintain the output of munitions.Several officers of the Ministry had met the leaders of the men, and explained the government&apos;s policy. It was important that thenegotiations should be carried on with the officials of the TradeUnions, and not with the shop stewards.The War Cabinet recognised the difficulty of drawing a clearline of distinction, which could be appreciated by the public,between ordinary trade disputes and a dispute connected withdilution, and stress was laid on the importance of victory beingassured in any struggle with the disaffected men. They took note of the fact that the Trade Union Advisory Committee had beenunanimously of opinion, that the mobility scheme of the Governmentwas, if anything, not drastic enough in view qf the militarysituation.The War Cabinet decided To sanction the policy proposed by the Minister of Munitions,and Mr. Churchill undertook to discuss with the Ministerof Labour the language of the draft announcement, and toconsider whether or not he should base the action he wasabout to take on the speech delivered by him in Augustlast.8. The Secretary&apos; drew attention to a memorandum circulatedby the Air Ministry on General Aerial Policy (G.T.-5076), and onthe Programme of Development of the Royal Air Force (G.T.-5096).It was generally agreed that this question could not be finallydisposed of except as part of the larger Man-Power problem.The War Cabinet decided that For the immediate present the requirements of the Royal Air-Farce in personnel should be arranged from month tomonth between the Secretary of State for the Air and theMinister of National Service.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,July 16, 1918.o
