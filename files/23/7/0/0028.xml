Tlie Western Front?1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that on theprevious day our troops had advanced two or three kilometres in several places, and that the French had taken Roye. The germans had put into the light an additional 5 divisions on the previous day,hut they had not succeeded in really stopping our advance. Thefighting was again reported as having been of the nature of advance-guard and rear-guard actions.North of the Sornnie, since the 8th August the Germans hademployed 35 divisions, several of which had already been usedtwice. South of the Somme, 47 German divisions had been employed,and several of these, too, had twice taken, part in the fight. Thetotal strength of the enemy on^our part of the front had nowdropped to 199 divisions as compared with 208 previously employed.Documents recently. obtained from prisoners showed that somecompanies were down to 70 men, and some even to 35, and therewas evidence that units were below strength when the battle began.There could be little doubt, therefore, that the Germans werefeeling a shortage of man-power.MesopotamiaProvision of FordCars.2. With reference to War Cabinet 455, Minute 6, in regardto the provision of an additional 1,300 Ford cars for ourMesopotamia force, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff saidthat he had received from Mr. Chamberlain (who was unable toattend the Cabinet) a copy of a telegram from Mr. Lansing toMr. Crosby, in the following sense : &quot; Upon advice of State Department, we have refusedapplicatiou to purchase Ford cars for Mesopotamia, and notifiedthe Purchasing Committee not to approve any other applicationfor shipment to that sphere of operations.&quot;The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that this refusal onthe part of the American Government might have a serious effect onour operations in Mesopotamia, where the situation was very grave.These Ford cars were particularly wanted because they were of alight and strong pattern, suitable to the country, and it would notbe possible to obtain similar cars in this country to take their place.We had hoped that the 1,300 Ford cars would have been out inMesopotamia during next October.Lord Reading said that, from the wording of the telegram andthe fact that it had been sent by Mr. Lansing, it appeared that thisquestion, which involved an important matter of policy, had been referred to the Cabinet or to President Wilson himself, and that,therefore, it might be regarded as a definite decision of the President.It practically meant that the American Government wished to keepall their supplies for the Western front. There was some uneasinessin the United States as to the American capacity to supply all therequirements of their own divisions on the Western front, and, nodoubt, fear of going short had prompted this telegram which had now come from Mr. Lansing. Lord Reading suggested that a tele-gram should be sent at once to Washington, putting the whole case before President Wilson, and pressing him to comply with therequest of the British Government in regard to Ford cars.The War Cabinet decided that &apos;The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should supply the materials for such a telegram (including copies of anytelegrams already sent on the subject by Mr. Chamberlainor the War Office) to Lord Reading and Lord robert cecil, who should confer and despatch a telegram to washington.
Defence of the 4. With reference to War Cabinet 461,  Minute 13, the WarRealm Acts: Cabinet continued the consideration of Section 40 D. of the DefenceSection 40 D. 0f ^ae Reaim Acts, and had before them a memorandum by theHome Secretary (Paper G.T.-5504) and a memorandum by the deputy-Secretary of State for War (Paper G.T.-5507).Sir George Cave outlined the improvements which he thoughtmight be adopted in the administration of Section 40 D. He statedthat a special regulation would be required to secure greater privacywhen women were brought before magistrates. He proposed, there-fore, that magistrates should request the representatives of thepress not to make public the name of any woman charged under the regulation who claimed to be examined by a doctor until the resultof such examination was known. He also proposed to insert theamendment adopted by the Canadian Government, which providedthat the examination might be carried out by a doctor appointed forthat purpose by the Court, and a proviso similar to that containedin Clause 5 of the Criminal Law Amendment Bill, providing that A woman shall not be convicted under this regulation if sheproves that she had reasonable grounds to believe that shewas free from venereal disease in a communicable form atthe time the alleged offence was committed.In order to meet the question of blackmail, he proposed to insertSub-section6! of Clause 5 of the Criminal Law Amendment Bill: &quot; An offence under this regulation shall be deemed to be an offence to which section 29 of The Larceny Act, 1916[which relates to the demanding of money, &amp;c, wdthmenaces], applies.&quot;He thought these various amendments would have some real effecton general public opinion, although they would not satisfy the more active agitators. With regard to the question &quot;of excluding uh-desirable women from railway stations and their approaches, this wasa matter of some difficulty, but he was considering the cpiestion withthe Police and Military Authorities, and all that was possible would bedone. In this connection he paid a tribute to the work of the volun-tary agencies at the railway stations. He had seen a copy of the NewZealand Social and Hygiene Act, .1917. This was a very elaborateAct, requiring compulsory notification, and included a penal provisionagainst those who knowingly infected, or were guilty of acts likelyto lead to infection.Shortage of 3. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the feeding Stuffs. Food Controller (Paper G.T.-5474) with regard to the shortage of feeding-stuffs.IVir. Prothero and Mr. Beveridge (on behalf of Mr. Clynes)agreed that the question raised in this memorandum was one whichhad better be referred in the first instance to the recently appointedInter-Allied Food Council Committee of Representatives, of which sir John Beale was Chairman. The problem of feeding-stuffs wasclosely related to that of tonnage, and it would be necessary tonegotiate in the matter with the the Allied Maritime transport council. After these two bodies had deliberated, the question would ultimately, in the event of the demands of the Ministry ofFood not being satisfied, have to come back to the Cabinet for finaldecision.The AVar Cabinet decided that The problem of feeding-stuffs (Paper G.T.-5474) should bereferred, in the first instance, to the Inter Allied. FoodCouncil Committee of Representatives, who should confer with the Allied Maritime Transport Council.
Sir Gordon Hewart said that with reference to the extension ofthe Regulation to the civilian population, he did not think the diffi-culties of such extensions should be serious. It had been held bythe Courts that whether a Regulation was reasonable!.am] necessarywas a question of fact to be determined by a jury. He supposed theauthors of Regulation 40 D. had satisfied themselves that it wasreasonabkTLaJttA necessary. Its extension, therefore, was a matter ofpolicy, and it should not be palpably more difficult to defend the regulation, when extended, than when, as now, it applied to women.At a time when the whole citizen body was in the Army, subject to exceptions of youth, age, and sex, he believed it should not be impos-sible to extend the Regulation if its extension were desirable on grounds of policy. In expressing this opinion he was assuming thatthere existed sufficient evidence to justify the present. Regulation,evidence tending to show that there was a reasonable probability that the Regulation would diminish venereal disease in the Army,and indicating the importance of such diminution to the efficiency of the Army.Lord Robert Cecil said he was convinced that the agitation inthe country was very strong and widespread, and in the event of ageneral election considerable pressure woxdd be put on candidates.The case against the Regulation was not contemptible in argument,and the danger of blackmailing ^hreats to young women brought before the Courts, even if not convicted, was a very real one. he wished to suggest, for the consideration of the War- Cabinet, the advisability of appointing a Royal Commission to examine theposition, which might consist of three men, three women, with an ex-Cabinet Minister as chairman. It would be essential that, if suchan enquiry were set up, its proceedings should be conducted withgreat speed, and that its report should be issued at the earliestpossible moment.Mr. Ian Macpherson said that he was prepared to defend the regulation, and he did not think matters would be improved bythe appointment of a Royal Commission. Such a commission would overlap the Joint Committee of both Houses, which was considering the Criminal Law Amendment Bill, and an unfortunatesituation would arise if the report of the Commission anticipatedthe fiudings of the Committee or ran counter to them. If the RoyalCommission reported against the continuation of Regulation 40 D.,the Committee would have to drop Clause 5 of the Criminal law amendment Bill.Mr. Barnes urged that, if the Regulation were allowed tocontinue in force during the sittings of the Commission, women would feel that an injustice was being done to them, and would point to the existence of the Commission as proof that the Govern-ment itself was in doubt as to the wisdom of the Regulation. Hehad received strong resolutions from a large number of repre-sentative women&apos;s organisations protesting against the Regulation.Sir George Cave said that, in view of the serious agitation on foot, he was not opposed to the appointment of a Royal Corn-mission, but he was against the suspension of the Regulation duringthe meetings of the Commission, as he was convinced that it was a real help in checking the spread of the disease.Sir Edward Kemp said he wished to endorse the views alreadylaid before the Government by Sir Robert Borden, and to pointout that the Canadian Government would be placed in a mostembarrassing position unless they urged the necessity for the greatest possible protection being afforded to soldiers from overseas. He was advised that the Canadian medical authorities felt that the Regulationwas having beneficial results so far as the overseas soldiers were concerned.Lord Reading said that a Royal Commission would only beof value if it could be made to act quickly, hut with so many ljorganisations who woidd wish to give evidence it would be difficult
to secure a Report under two or three months. To the request for the suspension of the Regulation during the enquiry, theGovernment could reply that it was proposed to report on thematter immediately, and that therefore it was not worth whilesuspending the Regulation for so short a period.The War Cabinet were generally agreed that the question hadto be regarded as one of political expediency, and that if an enquirywere held it should be made plain that it was not being heldbecause the War Cabinet were in doubt as to the value of regulation 40 D., but on account of the strong representations whichhad been made to the Government on the subject.The War Cabinet decided that Subject to the approval of the Prime Minister, a submissionshould be made to His Majesty to appoint a RoyalCommission to consider Regulation 40 D., what amendments of it (if any) were desirable, and particularly the advisability of extending it to the civilian population.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,August 28, 1918.
