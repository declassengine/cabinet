The Western Front. 1. In continuation of WTar Cabinet 468, Minute 1, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff reported that the British troops were nowup against the Marquion Canal. This canal, which, when completed,will connect the Aisne with the sea, had at present no water in it,but at some places was 90 feet in depth. The advance made on theprevious day by the British troops was of the greatest value. Noreport had been received as to the number of prisoners taken, butthe official communique had called attention to the capture of bootyand war material. Marquion bad been a very big German depot,and it would now be impossible for any stores to be removed from it which had not already been taken away. Questioned as to the probability of regaining stores, sheds, and war material lost duringthe British retirement, Sir Henry Wilson said that all sheds hadbeen destroyed, and that he had been informed that the La Basseecountry was burning. Sir Henry Wilson said that the french military authorities were of opinion that the enemy were falling back from the Vesle hills.,2. The First Lord of the Admiralty called the attention of theWar Cabinet to the death of Captain Cromie, the British naval attache in Petrograd, reported in telegram No. 2602, of the3rd September, 1918, from Sir R. Paget, Copenhagen. Sir eric geddes said that this was very grave news for the Admiralty, as the death of this officer severed the last links of communication whichthe Admiralty had with Russia. Captain Cromie had apparentlydied in a very gallant manner, remaining behind on duty at the embassy at Petrograd, the only man left, and defending himself tothe end. Captain Cromie was an officer who had been with theBritish submarines in the Baltic, and who was most reliable andresourceful, and Sir Eric Geddes expressed the opinion that hewould have taken every precaution to destroy official documents and leave nothing behind which might afford valuable information to theRevolutionaiy Government. Sir Eric Geddes expressed the hopethat some posthumous recognition of Captain Cromie&apos;s devotion to duty would be made by the British Government.The Assistant Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated thatrumours had reached him that the Empress of Russia and herdaughters had been killed. What remained of the British embassy had been moved to Moscow, and no Embassy documents had been left in Petrograd. Lord Robert Cecil was strongly of opinion thatsome action should be taken by the British Government with regardto the murder of Captain Cromie, and suggested that M. Litvinoffshould be imprisoned or at least interned, and that a strongly-wordedtelegram should be sent to the Revolutionary Government threaten-ing personal reprisals against its leaders. No information had beenreceived from Mr. Lockhart since the 17th August, when it was reported that he was at Moscow. The Foreign Office had practicallyarrived at an agreement with the Soviet Government to repatriatethe British representatives in Moscow when the Soviet Governmentput forward fresh terms. The proposal of these fresh terms inclinedthe Foreign Office to think that the British representatives had all been killed.Some doubt was expressed as to whether it would be legal tointern or imprison M. Litvinoff under the Habeas Corpus Act, andthe War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should ascertain whether M. Litvinoff could be legally interned, and, if so,take the necessary action.(b.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should send atelegram to the Soviet Government, threatening reprisals against M. Trotzki, M. Lenin, and the leaders of thatGovernment if the lives of British subjects were notsafeguarded.Buseia:Death of CaptainCromie.
Air Service and 4. The War Cabinet had under consideration a letter fromEngme Position.      Mr. Joynson Hicks, M.P., and notes by Lord Weir on the letter,with reference to the engine position of the Air Service (paper g.T.-5547).The Minister of Munitions said that it was quite correct thatthe engine production had not increased in the proportion that hadbeen hoped for, but at the same time there had been an enormousincrease last year. With regard to the failure of &quot; Liberty &quot; enginesto arrive, efforts had been made to procure more from the Americans,and to induce the French authorities not to take the full amount which they had asked for. On this question, however, it was verydifficult to get definite decisions, owing to the constant change of american representatives.The Prime Minister said that this question was involved withthe many others under the heading of Man-power which were underthe consideration of the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet took note of the letter from Mr. JoynsonHicks, and of the fact that all the points put forward byhim had been fully answered in the Notes by the Secretaryof State for Air.Shipment of 5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMules to India. War Office (Paper G.T.-5566) in regard to the shipment of mules toIndia. The Memorandum contained a request from the War office for a decision by the War Cabinet that shipping should be provided to India (a.) For 7,400 mules from China required to make up thenumbers needed in India this year ;(o.) For 4,600 mules from Argentina required to make up thenumbers needed in India this year ;(c.) For 9,200 mules from Argentina to meet the Commander-in-Chiefs supplementary demand, detailed in paragraph 3of the memorandum ; and(d.) For 6,000 mules or less from Argentina needed for thesupply of the year 1919-1920.Air Activities. 3. The Chief of the Air Staff reported that there had beenheav)^ air fighting in France, much work having been done againstground targets. During the last few days the losses of Britishmachines had been heavy, forty-nine having been destroyed, mainlyowing to fire from the ground. On the other hand, in additionto the great effect contributed against troops, &amp;c,, on the ground,fifty-five enemy machines had been definitely destroyed and twenty-eight brought down, making a total of eighty-three. It was hopedthat an armoured squadron to assist in fighting ground targetswould arrive in France early next month.The units of the Independent Air Force had met with consider-able fighting, both during outward and return journeys, and therewere signs that considerable numbers of German machines werebeing concentrated in the area opposite to us. With reference tothe fires started in the Black Forest by bombs from our machines(War Cabinet 461, Minute 11), General Sykes said it was difficult to get any definite information, but he had received a reportto the effect that several large fires had been seen from a distance of 40 miles.The Night-fighting Squadron near Abbeville was doing very good work in bringing down German night-bombing machines.Great efforts were being made to organise and put rapidly into thenorthern ijrea in France one or two more such squadrons. Night-fighting Squadrons in France really formed the first line of night airhome defences.
With regard to the fourth item on this list, namely, item (d), for,000 mules from Argentina for 1919-1920, it was decided that This demand need not be considered at present.The Shipping Controller said that the whole tonnage position was very difficult, and depended upon the amount of assistanceduring the coming year that was to be given to the United states in the transport of their troops and stores. The United Statesdemand at present amounted to about 2,000,000 tons deadweight ofshipping.The view was expressed, however, that we should not starve ourown Army generally, or our Army in the East in particular, havingregard to the seriousness of the position in Persia; in order to supply the United States demands in full.The War Cabinet, who concurred in this view, decided that  Shipping should be provided for the mule programme as sub-mitted in the War Office Memorandum, with the exceptionof item (d) for 6,000 mules from Argentina, which need notbe considered at present as the demand is for 1919-20.Sea Transport tor 6. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thethe East African Ministry of Shipping (Paper G.T.-5309) in regard to the cost of seaCampaign. transport in connection with the East African Expedition.    Thenumber of ships regularly employed amounted to twenty-one, ofwhich the total gross tonnage was 74,773 tons. In addition to theactual cost of the shipping, the number of sea bases open in EastAfrica involved the employment of a large transport staff to super-vise the shipping.The Secretary of State for war said that the War Office werein complete sympathy with the Shipping Controllers desire for economy in tonnage in connection with the East African Expedition,and arrangements had been considered whereby reductions could bemade. During the last week, however, the telegrams from EastAfrica encouraged the hope that ihe campaign might be over in thenear future. The next month or two would show whether thesehopes were realised. 1General Smuts said that be shared the expectation that theEast African campaign was at last coming to an end.In these circumstances, the War Cabinet asked The Shipping Controller to raise the question again in a months,time.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,September 4, 1918.
