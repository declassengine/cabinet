In continuation of War Cabinet 478, Minute 3, the Chief ofFront, the Imperial General Staff reported satisfactory news in regardto the Franco-American advance. The Americans had pushed forward 16 kilometres down the Meuse. They and the Frenchtogether had taken 14,000 prisoners up to the previous night, andwere reported to be advancing without much opposition. If this attack were completely successful, and it were possible fully to exploit the victory as far as Mezieres, there was every likelihood of a bigretreat on the part of the enemy, which would clear a large tract of territory. In that case the Germans might make a stand at Lille,but they could not do so at St. Quentin.British Attack. 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that anattack had been made that morning by the 1st and IITrd british armies opposite Cambrai. The latest information was to the effectthat the attack was proceeding satisfactorily.
German Moral. 3. With reference to War Cabinet 478, Minute 4, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff said that the recent incident, when threeofficers and 104 Germans of the 273rd North Prussian Regiment badwalked over to our lines to the north-west of St. Quentin and hadsurrendered voluntarily, was very significant. This was the first timein the War that such a case had occurred. These men had reportedthat the German moral was very bad, and that they despaired of victory. News had also been received that German troops returning to Germany were spreading an atmosphere of despondency and alarm.An order issued by General LudendorfT had been captured which contained an allusion to this subject : all men who were suspected of being despondent were to be refused leave, and if a man on leavein Germany was heard expressing gloomy sentiments he was to bepromptly sent back to the front.Austrian Divisions, 4   With reference to War Cabinet 462, Minute 2, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff reported that another Austrian division hand been identified in the Yosges, making a total of five Austriandivisions on the Western front.The Caucasus.5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theGermans were withdrawing the whole of their men from theCaucasus. The Turks also were trying to withdraw their forces,with the result that there was great confusion between the Turksand the Germans at Batoum and in the interior.Italy. 6. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that since,General Diaz had shown clearly that he was not going to attack,the -British had withdrawn nine battalions, and we were replacingour present fresh divisions with tired ones from the Western from&apos;t.General Badoglio had expressed his willingness, in the event of there being no attack, to send Italian divisions to Prance.Archangel. 7. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that arrange-ments were being made between the War Office and the-admiralty for the fitting out and freezing-in of a hospital ship at Archangel,where hospital arrangements were reported to be inadequate.Submarines.8. The First Sea Lord reported two attacks on enemy submarines:one in the Mediterranean, carried out by the French, the otheroutside the Firth of Forth.Palestine :Work of theRoyal Air Force.9. The Chief of ;&apos;the Air Staff said that he had received atelegram from Egypt in regard to the work of the Royal Air force during the recent operations in Palestine.The War Cabinet requested The Chief.of the Air Staff to circulate copies of this telegram.-Bombing ofI Constantinople.10. The Chief of the Air Staff stated that the aerial operationscarried out in the Palestine had been performed at the expense oftraining in Egypt. He asked whether it was desired now toincrease the hombing of Constantinople also at the expense ofEgypt,
132Railway Strike: 11. With reference to War Cabinet 478, Minute 1, the WarTelegram of Cabinet discussed the desirability of sending a telegram of apprecia-Appreciation to        tion to Mr. J. H. Thomas, in recognition of his action during the. J. H. Thomas.    recent strike.    The following draft was proposed for the Secretaryto send on their behalf : -&quot; The War Cabinet desire me to express to you their warmappreciation of the strong stand made by you against the strike,which endangered the national security as affected by thesuccessful prosecution of the war no less than it threatened thebasis of trade union action. The War Cabinet are very sorry to hear that the strain lias affected your health, and hope thata short rest will quickly re-establish it and enable you to resumework which has been of such value to the nation.&quot;The matter was deferred pending an opportunity for theChancellor of the Exchequer to consult the Prime Minister,and for Mr. Barnes to confer with Sir Albert Stanley on thesubject.National Research 12. The War Cabinet had under consideration an AdmiraltyInstitution for the memorandum (Paper G.T.-5702) recommending a Physical ResearchNavy. Institution for the Navy.Mr. Merz, on behalf of the Admiralty, explained that theproposal asked the War Cabinet for their approval of a policy forthe creation of a proper Research Institution for the Navy.Nothing of this nature had existed in the past, and the war had shown the necessity for some such Institution, by which the scientistswould be put in close touch with the naval officer as the practicalman and vice versa. As an instance of the need for such an institution, Mr. Merz quoted the submarine menace and thenecessity of solving the problem of accurately determining thewhereabouts of a submarine when submerged. In the opinion of experts it was essential to deal, in the first instance, with pureresearch, prior to practical application, for inventions would not follow without the former method being adopted. He stated thatthe proposal had been very exhaustively considered by Sir J. J.Thompson, Sir E. Rutherford, and Sir Richard Threlfall, and theywere unanimously of opinion that the best method of making theservices of science available to the needs of the Navy would be toestablish a Naval Research Laboratory for Physics, for the purposeof making scientific research of a fundamental and pioneercharacter on all problems underlying the work of the Navy. Asregards the question as to how far such a policy was justified inview of its having no great effect during the war, Mr. Merz statedthat this argument could well be met by the fact that the country&apos;sresearch facilities in all directions were deplorably deficient, andthat an Institution, if created for the Navy, could be utilised for research work in other than naval directions. Mr. Merz stated thatthe lowness of our expenditure, as compared with other countries,was astounding ; in fact, the Americans would vote in one year thesum total asked for by the Admiralty, namely 400,OOOL, for thispurpose.The First Lord of the Admiralty stated that, although therewere other institutions in existence dealing with research work, theywere not suitable for that required by the Navy. It was essential,for naval work, that absolute secrecy must be observed, and this wasThe War Cabinet,decided that This question should be settled by the Chief of the Air Staffin consultation with the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff and the Admiralty.
not practicable when work of a commercial nature was being carriedout. He was sure that if, at the outbreak of war, we had had theorganisation which he now recommended in this respect, we should now have been much nearer a solution of the submarine menace, andthat what was required was an institution in which the scientists and the naval experts were working together. The three points he wished to make were : (a.) Secrecy must be possible. . , .......(o.) That it should be devoted to non-commercial research.(a.) That it should work closely with the Navy, department by department.Lord Curzon stated that, as Lord President of the Council, hewas President of the Committee of Scientific and industrial research, and, although he considered that the First Lord had made out a very good case, and admitted that research work in Englandwas in a very confused condition, to remedy which efforts were nowbeing made, he thought care must be taken that money was notwasted, and that overlapping between kindred bodies should notarise. He therefore suggested that it would be well, before agreeing to the Admiralty proposal, that the matter should be considered bythe Council of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.He mentioned the existence of a further institution, namely, theNational Physical Laboratory, which was doing a good deal of workon somewhat parallel lines to that of the proposed new institution,and he thought that they should also have an opportunity of con-sidering the Admiralty proposal.It was pointed out that, if the War Cabinet sanctioned . theAdmiralty proposal, we should be met by demands from the Ministryof Munitions and from the R.oyai Air Force for the creation of similar institutions connected with the Army and the Air forces, andthat it was highly important that the several Departments shouldnot conduct their research work in watertight compartments, butthat, as far as might be practicable, consistent with secrecy, the research, should cover the widest field; otherwise the knowledgeacquired in one would not be available for the others.Mr. Balfour stated that, whilst he was First Lord of theAdmiralty, he started the Board of Invention and Research, whichhe believed had done good work. He agreed with the First Lordthat science and practical knowledge must be combined, and emphasised the point made by him that seerecy was essential, whichwould not be possible if they were amalgamated. Mr. Balfourappreciated the danger of isolation, and thought it might be possibleto have a few men of position who could be made Directors of allResearch Institutions that might be set up, so that data obtained by one branch, if not of a secret nature, might be available for the others.The War Cabinet agreed in principle that something wasnecessary on behalf of Naval research, and decided-To appoint a Committee, of which Lord Curzon consented to be chairman, to enquire into the recommendations of theAdnnralty, in the light of the discussion set out above,Lord Curzon to be assisted in this matter by The Minister of Education, and Representatives of The Admiralty, i:The Ministry of Munitions.The War Office.The Treasury.,The Air Ministry.. ,     ,     ...The National Physical Laboratory.The  Department of Scientific  and  industrial research.
B 3Strike ot Clyde.;; 13.   With reference to   War   Cabinet   478,  Minute   2,  theShipwrights. Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the War Cabinet that a notice, relative to the Clyde strike, had been prepared and wouldappear in the newspapers, &amp;c, on the following day, to operate fromTuesday next. The notice would specify that the certificates ofprotection would be withdrawn if the men did not return bythat day.Sir Eobert Home informed the War Cabinet that he hadreceived information to the effect that it was thought that the men would be prepared to return to work on Tuesday, Monday being ageneral holiday on the Clyde.Discontent in theNavy.14. The First Lord informed the War Cabinet that Mr. LionelYexley, the editor of &quot; The Fleet,&quot; recently circulated a document on the question of unrest on the lower deck of the Navy, in whichhe made alarming statements relative to the grievances that existedon the part of the men. Sir Eric Geddes stated that the Board ofAdmiralty had gone into the matter most exhaustively, and theresult of their enquiries led them to the opinion that there was acertain amount of dissatisfaction, but that there was no reason tobelieve that such dissatisfaction was of an alarming nature. Most ofthe grievances which could be substantiated related to pay, and concessions had been made in certain cases that had already beenenquired into, and further enquiries were being made into theremaining cases. The origin of the discontent appeared to be thedifference between the pay awarded to civilians as compared withthat of the fighting forces, and the influence that the same had onthe comforts of the seamen&apos;s homes. Sir Eric Geddes then read tothe War Cabinet a letter which he had written to the Prime minister on this subject.! In this connection, reference was made to the War Cabinet 477,Minute 4, in which the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee were asked to see whether separation allowances to the relatives and dependants of sailors and soldiers ought not now to be increased.The War Cabinet decided that The question of increasing the pay of the Army and navy should not be considered until after the question of anincrease in the separation allowances had been reportedupon.Naval Situation inthe Black Sea:Command in theMediterranean.15. The War Cabinet had under consideration the naval situa-tion in the Black Sea and the command in the Mediterranean, as setout in Admiralty memorandum G.T.-5775, in which it was pointedout that by the end of November next it would be possible for theenemy to come out of the Dardanelles in excessive force at hisselected moment, do great damage, and then return to his bases.The First Lord drew the attention of the War Cabinet to theprobable strength of the Russo-Turko-German Black Sea forces ascompared with the Allied ^aegean squadron, the latter being at normalstrength, which indicated a superiority on the part of the enemy.To meet this, in part, Sir Eric Geddes stated that the admiralty were relieving two of our pre-Dreadnoughts in the iEgean by twoDreadnoughts; but, in spite of the improvement which would result from this action, the Allies would still have an inferiority of lightThe War Cabinet also requested The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to assist the deliberations of the above Committee if he could sparethe time.

craft in the ^aegean Sea and elsewhere. The First Lord stated thatthis state of affairs need not exist if the Allied naval forces already in the Mediterranean were used to the best advantage, and that theonly way of effecting this improvement was to obtain permission of our Allies to the appointment of a British Admiral asAdmiralissimo in the Mediterranean (War Cabinet 431, Minute 4).The First Lord stated that, since the matter was last discussed by the War Cabinet, he had been continuing his conversa-tions with the Italian Governmen t, by permission of the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, through the British Ambasssdor at Rome,but informally, and, as Tar: as &apos; could be gathered, the Italians now agreed to the appointment of Lord Jellicoe as Admiralissimo, subjectto that officer being under the Supreme War Council at Versailles.The Board of Admiralty considered that direct control by theSupreme War Council was impracticable. The condition of navalwarfare depended to a very marked extent on considerations of technical detail, on which the Supreme War Council would have no knowledge whatsoever, and it was essential that the Admiralissimoshould be under the immediate orders of some body which had the requisite technical knowledge and staff. The Board thereforeadvocated that he should be under the Allied Naval Council, whichwas an executive body, and which would consider Lord JeIlicoe&apos;demands for the Mediterranean, which was a minor theatre of war,in conjunction with the needs of the main theatre of war, namely,the North Sea. Sir Eric Geddes asked that the War Cabinet would approve further negotiations being conducted with the Italians bythe Foreign Office, on the lines recommended by the Admiralty, towhich the other Naval Powers agreed.It was pointed out that the Italian objection would be met bythe procedure advocated, as, if a unanimous decision were not reached by the Allied Naval Council, the matter could be brought beforethe Supreme War Council for settlement, and consequently LordJellicoe, though under the Allied Naval Council, would be, throughthat body, subject to the Supreme War Council.The War Cabinet approved the proposal of the First Lord ofthe Admiralty, and requested him to arrange with theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs as to the form ofcommunication to be made to the Italian Government.(Initialled) A.
