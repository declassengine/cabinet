The western front:Presence of anAustrian Division:1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff said, that there wasno news of importance from Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig; wehad, however, recovered the Morlancourt line which had been lost onthe previous day.As regards movements, we had definitely ascertained that therewas now one Austrian division at Arlon, on the other side of theRiver Meuse. This was a good fighting division, which had been recently in the line opposite the Montello. on the River Piave, andit had not been heavily engaged since the Piave battle. Thepoints the War Office wished to clear up were, whether it was asingle division, and, if so, whether a German division had been sentdown to the Italian front in exchange for it. If the result of theirenquiries were to show that, say, half a- dozen or more Austrian andGerman divisions were being exchanged between the French andItalian fronts, this would mean an almost certain indication that thenext offensive would be against the Italians. No information hadbeen received of the movement of any German division to theAustrian front.communication from marshal foch.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he hadreceived a communication that clay from Marshal Foch regardingthe situation on the Vesle line. The German artillery concen-tratecl on the Chemin des Dames were able to sweep the VesleValley up to Bazoches. Consequently, if the Marshal decided toattempt to force the line, he would have to do it on the upperwaters of the river between i&apos; ismes and Rheims. There was nothing yet to show whether the Germans really meant to stand onthat line, and it was possible that the French would make strongreconnaissances in various directions in order to try and find out their intentions. General Wilson said that, between the RiversVesle and Aisne, the situation of the Germans would be far fromenviable, as the guns of the Allies were able to fire on the bridgesthey must use, and the Aisne Valley in winter was subject to heavyfloods.Marshal Foch3. The War Cabinet instructed  ,The War Office to send a telegram to Marshal Foch, conveyingto him their congratulations on his promotion to Marshal.The Czecho- 4. The Chief of the Imperial General Stall&apos; invited.the attentionSlovak Forces. Gf ^jie \yar Cabinet to a rather alarming telegram from Lord Reading(No. 3530, of August 5, 1918,) forwarding a message from Dr.Spatcher Houska, at Vladivostok, fur Professor Maszaryk, at Wash-ington. The contents of the message might be shortly reduced to two questions : first, should the Czecho-Slovaks concentrate atVladivostok; second, should the Czecho-Slovaks clear out of Russia.General Wilson said that if we assented to the latter proposition weshould be in a very serious position, as we should then be absolutelyunable to carry out our idea of re-establishing an Eastern front,and it would place the Allied contingents at Murmansk andArchangel in an untenable position : both of which contingencieswere, from a, military, point of view, matters of grave concern.Although an immediate decision on the part of the War cabinet might not be necessary, it was, in General Wilson&apos;s opinion, very necessary to prevent, if possible, any hasty and premature action onthe part of the President of the United States, whose one idea inconsenting to Allied action in the Far East had been to save the czecho-SJovaks.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs briefly reviewed the events which had led up to the present activities of the allies in the Far East. Some months ago our policy had been to get the czech o-Slovaks out of Russia. The French, who at that time were seriously alarmed at the great depletion of man-power on the western front, had insisted that they should be., brought from Russia to thatfront. The matter then had been discussed at a Conference at versailles, when it had been pointed out (a.) That there was not sufficient tonnage to evacuate them from Russia ;(6.) That the Czecho-Slovaks. were required for the general purposes of the Allies in Russia.To these arguments M. Clemenceau hud yielded,Although President Wilson was strongly opposed to a boldSiberian policy, he had consented to our sending troops to Vladivostok,in order to save the Czechs. With this the co-belligerents had hadto remain satisfied, but they had always cherished the hope that president Wilson might eventually be induced to subscribe to theirlarger policy. Mr. Balfour also pointed out that the Americans had never accepted the expeditions to Archmgel and Murmansk as being-linked up with our policy in the Far East. Mr. Balfour suggestedthat the War Cabinet should take the following action : that theForeign Office should telegraph to Washington, explaining the wholecase ; that they should send a similar telegram to Paris, giving thearguments against the removal of the Czecho-Slovaks from Russia,and asking Lord Derby to find out if M. Clemenceau agreed, and,O ^ O 7 if so, to request him to telegraph to the French representative atWashington to consult with our own representative before either soughtan interview with the President. Mr. Balfour thought at the sametime that Lor.1 Derby should be instructed to see M. Benes and toconfer with him. Mr. B-dfour, proceeding, said that he did not quiteagree with the General Staff interpretation of the telegram. he did not himself think that there wras any real intention &quot;of clearing-out of R-ussia He thought all the Czecho-Slovaks intended was togo into winter quarters ; their view was, &quot;We must fight, we mustwin, we must organise, we must go into winter quarters,, we mustprepare for future military operations, we must reassure the localpopulations as to our good intentions.&quot; If the War Cabinet agreedto the action he suggested, he would, in drafting the telegrams, keepin view the hypotheses both of his own Department and of the WarOffice. In reply to a suggestion that President Wilson might bemore impressed if he received a joint telegram submitted by theFrench and British Governments. Mr. Balfour said that the Presidentdisliked identic telegrams, as he, revcted anything in the nature ofconcerted pressure.The Secretary of State for War reminded the Cabinet that theFrench Government had widened their views since the man-power situation on the Western.front had been, and was beino-, so exten-sively relieved by constant American reinforcements. He thought the question was essentially one for the Supreme War Council,which, however, would not, in the ordinary course, meet for anotherfortnight.The War Cabinet, agreed that a final decision could be deferred,for a week or two, and that the matter should be brought before theSupreme War Council at its next meeting. They further agreedthat it was most necessary that the President of the United states should not commit himself definitely and prematurely on the subject,and they decided To authorise tl e action suggested by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.
Archangel and     - 5. With reference to the foregoing discussion, the Chief of the murmansk. Imperial General Staff reported that the Germans had already laid130 kilometres of railway line towards Petqhenga, which meant thatthey had only another 270 kilometres to complete. This showed avery rapid rate of progress.It was pointed out that the exjieditions to Archangel and murmansk were in the nature of a gamble, but we were quitejustified so long as we were still able to maintain an Eastern front in Russia. If. however, that front disappeared, our forces in thenorth would be in a very dangerous position.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed that thesituation of our two small forces in Murmansk and Archangel, whichwere linked up only by sea and were liable to attack by greatlysuperior forces, was very precarious. He referred to a - telegramfrom our representative at Washington, No. 353S, dated the 5thAugust, 1918. which stated that the State Department, after consulting with the military authorities, say- that while the UnitedStates Government can supply foodstuffs, they are unable to provideships to carry these supplies to Archangel ; and they were absolutelyopposed to the diversion of any American&apos; ships for other purposesthan supplying the requirements of American troops in France.Mr. Baltour said that we had not only to provide for the needs of thetwo little expeditionary forces in North Russia, but we were alsoproposing to feed the civil populations in these areas, and wefurther contemplated supplying the civil needs at Vologda. Havingregard to the difficulties of tonnage, he wondered whether we werepursuing the right policy.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff thought that, as long asAmerica would guarantee foodstuffs, we ought to be able to providethe shipping.He was in communication with the Ministry of Shipping on thesubject, and did not ask for a decision by the War Cabinet -atpresent.Mesopotamia: 6. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that a veryProvision of Ford serious contretemps had arisen in regard to the provision of anCars, additional 1,300 Foixl vans for our Mesopotamia, force.    It had been proposed to order these cars in America, but the order had been held up by the Inter-Ally Council on War Purchases. It was vital thatthe cars should be obtained without delay. -Mr. Chamberlain, as Chairman of the American Board in London,said that the War Office had already 3,000 Ford vans on order inAmerica. After the list of orders for consideration at the last meeting of the Inter-Ally Council had been sent in they had proposedto place a supplementary order for an additional I,3u0 vans for mesopotamia. This supplementary order had been passed by theBoard of which fie was Chairman, and had then gone to the Inter-Allied Council in Paris. The authorities in America would not allow any order to be placed unless it was approved by the Inter-AllyCouncil, but they reserved their right to disallow orders even whenso approved. The Council bad im-t on the 26th ultimo, when he himself was not present. Mr. Crosbj^ had now rai.-ed the questionof the necessity for these vans, and had doubted whether they couldbe&apos; made available, and the London Secretary had written, four days later, by direction of Mr. Crosby, to Mr. McFadyean, of theTreasury, to say that the order must be held up until Mr. Crosbyhad received answers to certain questions which he was putting toGeneral Bliss at Versailles. It was possible that the Americans werenot aware that these vans were intended for Mesopotamia. He had suggested to General Wilson that the latter should send a stronglyworded telegram to our Military Representative at Versailles asking him to do his utmost to induce General Bliss to use his best endeavour-vours on our behalf. The Americans were, unfortunately, verysuspicious of orders placed by us ; and their Government, even when If
Loss of British 7. The  Deputy First Sea Lord said that during operationsDestrovers. on the 2nd  instant, two destroyers,   &quot;Vehement&quot;   and   &quot;Ariel,&quot;struck enemy mines and sank. Our losses had been about 5 officersand 100 men. This brought our total losses of destroyers in thecourse of the last week to 4.Loss of Ambulance 8. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that, the ambulanceTransport. transport &quot; Warilda,&quot; on its way from Havre to Southampton, hadbeen torpedoed and sunk by an enemy submarine at 2 a.m. on the3rd instant.   735 survivors had been landed at Southampton.Enemy 9. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that 4 D.H. machinesSubmarines. from Taranto   had   carried   out   an   attack   on   Cattaro   on   the2nd instant. Four bombs had exploded among 3 submarines and 3 onseaplane bases. Another bomb was dropped on a transport, settingit on fire.    One of our machines failed to return.On the 3rd instant, trawlers, 2S miles off Trevose Head, droppedcharges on an enemy submarine, bringing oil and air bubbles to the surface.On the 4th instant, H.M.S. &quot;Martin&quot; had arrived at Brinclisiwith 6 officers and 21 men of the enemy submarine &quot; U.B. 53.&quot; Thesubmarine had fouled the barrage, exploding some mines, and came to the surface totally disabled, and then sank. &quot; E. 40 &quot; had engagedan enemy submarine on the 2nd instant west of the Naze. Duringthe action another enemy submarine had appeared and opened fire.&apos;&quot; E. 40 &quot; dived, but while submerging a shell burst in the conningtower, wounding the captain. The damage was confined to theconning tower and the periscope.Admiral Hope said that this showed that the Admiralty werejustified in the reservations they made in regard to reports theysometimes received regarding the probable loss of an enemy sub-marine when it had only received one direct hit from one of our. shells.An enemy submarine was attacked by&apos; armed trawlers on the4th instant off Malin Head with depth charges and howitzers. Thesubmarine broke, surface and appeared to turn over.The steamship &quot; Fthodesian Transport &quot; claimed to have sunk anenemy submarine by gun-fire 200 miles south-west of Ponta Delgada(Azores).- The destroyer &quot; Comet.&quot; while in tow after damage by collision,was torpedoed and sunk in the early morning of the 6th instant47 miles from Cape Passero. The survivors were being brought into Malta.they sent formal representatives to sit on Inter-Allied Boards andCouncils; soon seemed to lose confidence in them, as &quot;Washingtonsuspected its representatives of seeing everything through pro-Britishspectacles almost as soon as they arrived in England. Mr. Cham-berlain suggested that the War Office should send a strong statementof their &quot;case to the British Military Representative at Versaillesinstructing him to press that case on General Bliss, and thatMr. Chamberlain himself should telegraph to Mr. Crosby, who was now in Paris, asking that the matter should be dealt with at once as one of urgency.The War Cabinet decided That Mr. Chamberlain and the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff should at once telegraph as proposed by the former.
Archangel.10. The Deputy First Sea Lord said that it was reported from Archangel that H.M.S. &quot;Attentive&quot; proceeded to Bakharitsa,where the Red Army had made an incursion, early on the 3rdAugust, and had driven out the enemy with guns and landingparty. The enemy had retreated 6 or 7 miles. Fresh reinforce-ments had arrived. The wireless station was in our hands and working.Otranto Barrage.11. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that, with referenceto the recent encounter off Permuda Island, which resultedin the sinking of the Austrian battleship &quot; Szent Istvan,&quot; thefollowing information had been received from a reliable source.The Austrian capital ships were put to sea under pressure fromthe German Admiralty acting on the advice of the Admiral Com-ma commanding the German submarine flotilla in the Adriatic. The AustrianAdmiral was against the scheme in general, and especially objected to the instructions which had been worked out for carrying it out.The operation was meant to strike a severe blow against the whole system of the Otranto barrage, which had proved so efficient thatthe commanders of submarines considered the forcing of the barragea most risky enterprise. It appeared that, during the last fewmonths, the German Adriatic Flotilla had lost five submarines, andthat these losses are imputed to the measures adopted by the Alliesfor blocking the Otranto channel. In naval circles at Pola it isbelieved that the idea of knocking out the barrage has not been abandoned, and that the operation will again be attempted, probablyduring the present month.Air Reports:Recent ZeppelinAttack.12. The Chief of the Royal Air Staff reported that five Zeppelinshad attempted an attack on the East Coast, but had turned back owingto unfavourable weather. Flights of our aeroplanes from four stationshad pursued them, but the pursuit had been hampered by the cloudyweather. One Zeppelin had come down in flames, and another was believed to be seriously damaged, but had probably reachedport.The western front:Air Activities.13. The Chief of the Royal Air Staff reported that in France ouractivities in the air had been hampered by bad weather. Twentyenemy planes had, however, been destroyed, and one had been drivendown out of control.Our night squadron which had recently started work on theWestern front, had, so far, managed to destroy three enemy planes.The Germans also seemed anxious to avoid it, so that apparently the deterrent effect was good. .   -On the Belgian coast the usual bombing had been carried out,and two Fokker biplanes had been brought down.Offer of Eaton Hallfor a RoyalAeronauticalCollege.14. The War Cabinet had before them &quot;the copy of a letter fromthe Secretary of State for the Air Force to the Prime Minister(Paper G.T.-5249) regarding the offer of the Duke of Westminsterto present Eaton Hall to the nation for the purpose of a RoyalAeronautical College. The paper stated that the l)uke&apos;s very generousand patriotic offer had been very carefully considered by the AirDepartment, which had reluctantly come to the conclusion that its acceptance could not be justified, owing to expenses involved inconverting it into a college, the heavy charges of its maintenance,the unsuitability of its geographical position, and the difficulty of finding at reasonable cost adequate aerodrome accommodation.
The War Cabinet decided that-Before a final reply was sent to the Duke of Westminster, thecircumstances should be communicated by the Secretaryto the First Commissioner of Works, in case the buildingmight be considered suitable for other military purposes,in which event the First Commissioner should use his discretion in regard to approaching the Duke on thesubject.Re-afforestation.Conscription of wealth.15. With reference to. War Cabinet 411, Minute 17, the WarCabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of re-afforestation : Report by Lord Curzon and Mr. Barnes (Paper G.-215).Resolution of the Royal Scottish Agricultural Societv (paper g.T.-50G3).Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction (Paper G.-216).Memorandum by the President of the Board of Agriculture(Paper G.T.-5121).Lord Curzon explained that he and Mr. Barnes, to whom thequestion had been referred for decision by the War Cabinet, had-examined the tpiestion in detail and heard the views of the variousbodies interested. Their conclusions were embodied in the paper which had been circulated to their colleagues (Paper G.-215). Theyhad again carefully considered the objections that had been raised, and had taken steps to ascertain the general trend ofParliamentary opinion on the matter. Their renewed investigationshad led them to believe that their recommendations would beaccepted by Parliament, provided that (a.) Scotland is strongly i^resented on the Central ForestryAuthority, which would decide policy ;(6.) The actual work of administration in Scotland is carried outby a purely Scottish body, appointed for the purpose;(c.) Funds are provided and planting commenced at an early date.The War Cabinet approved the recommendations of Lord Curzonand Mr. Barnes, as set out in Paper G.-215.16. Mr. Barnes said . that he had been asked to report to ameeting of the Labour party, which was to be held that night, as towhat steps, if any, the Government was taking to set up aCommission to enquire into the national wealth of the country witha view to some form of conscription of wealth. .The opinion was generally expressed that the setting up of anysuch Commission would have serious effects&apos; on the borrowing powersof the Government, and the War Cabinet requested Mr. Barnes to explain the difficulties of the situation to theLabour party, and to ask them not to press for such &apos;aCommission at the present moment. The matter could notbe finally disposed of in the absence of the Prime Minister.Defence of the realm Acts:Section 40 e.17. With reference to War Cabinet 365, Minute 14, Mr. Barnesdrew the attention of the War Cabinet to the strong public opinion,which was being aroused all over the&apos; country by the enforcement ofDefence of the Realm Act Section 40 d.It was pointed out that this Regulation had been considered bythe Committee of Home Affairs, who had agreed, in view of the pressure from the Governments of the Dominions and of the UnitedStates, that it was not desirable to withdraw the protection afforded by the Regulation, but in order to remove certain misconceptions
8the Under-Secretary of State for War should issue a public explana-tory statement.The War Cabinet decided that The report of the Committee should be brought before the WarCabinet for consideration before a final decision on thisquestion was publicly announced.Soldiers of 18 18. The War Cabinet had under consideration the question ofYears of Age sent    whether soldiers of 18 years of age should be sent to France,to France. The Secretary of State for War said that the decision to sendboys of 18-g- years of age for service overseas had only been arrived at very reluctantly at a time of great crisis. It was now proposed to revert to the system in force before, under which no lad under19 years of age went abroad. The War Office would prefer to make this change on the 1st October, as by that date the full effect of theincreased recruiting in May and June would be beginning to be felt.It was not proposed to bring any boys already serving overseas backto England, as the majority already drafted would be approximately19 years old by then.It was generally urged that the change should he made as fromthe 1st September, and, in support of an earlier date, the opinion ofthe Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief in France was quoted,which was to the effect that lads of under 19 years of age were notfit to carry packs for any distance.The War Cabinet decided that After the 31st August, 1918, no soldiers under the age of19 years should be sent on active service overseas.Supply of Soldier 19. With reference to War Cabinet 438, Minute 11, the WarLabour for the Cabinet had under consideration&apos;two memoranda by the SecretaryScotland for Scotland (Papers G.T.-5264 and G.T.-5299) on the subject of thesupply of soldier labour for the Scottish harvest and the quota.The Secretary of State for War said that it was proposed togive 20,000 men from the army for the harvest in Great Britain,which number would be in addition to those to be sent fromcommand depdts, &amp;c. Of this number of 20,000, 10,000 had been allocated to Scotland.The Secretary for Scotland said that this proposal met thepoint urged in one of his memoranda (Paper G.T.-52G4), but did notdeal with the request he had put forward in his other memorandum(Paper G.T.-5299), that 1,400 of the men recently called up from agriculture in Scotland should be released from the army so as tosecure equality of treatment for Scotland with England and Wales.When the War Cabinet arrived at its decision on the 1st July (WarCabinet 438, Minute 11), it was thought that equality of treat-ment had been secured, the President of the Board of Agri-culture and the Minister of National Service having stated thatthe reduction in numbers, owing to the War Cabinet&apos;s decision asregards England and Wales (War Cabinet 436, Minute 14)would be very small. As a matter of fact, Scotland, by this decision,had secured a reduction of not more than 100 men from theirquota, or 2 per cent., whilst England had secured 5,547, or 22percent. The benefit to Wales had been to the extent of 2,614men, or 52 per cent, of their quota. Mr. Munro urged that scotland should i-eceive not only nominally but substantially equal treatmentwith England, and suggested that, while recognising the difficultiesof getting men already posted back from the Army, it might bepossible to return 1,000 men recently posted for harvest agricultural labour in Scotland. These men were pivotal men, such as the lastmen on farms, and they could be selected by the Board of Agriculture
Man-Power:Recruitment from coal Mines.20. With reference to War Cabinet 43 L, Minute 6, the WarCabinet had under consideration a minute from the secretary of theWar Priorities Committee to the Secretary of the War Cabinet(Paper G.T.-52G5), and a memorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade (Paper G.T.-5333) on the subject of the cessation of recruiting from the coal-mining industry.The War Cabinet decided that It was inadvisable, under present circumstances, to make anypromulgation of a pronouncement with regard to the suspension of recruiting from coal mines.The coal situation.21. The Minister of Shipping drew the attention of the WarCabinet to the serious situation now created owing to the graveshortage of coal. Sir Joseph Maclay suggested that the position might be eased by the reopening of the French mines in, northern france.The Secretary informed the War Cabinet that this question hadbeen mentioned on the previous day at a meeting of the Committeeof Prime Ministers, when it had been pointed out that there was apparently nothing at present in the military situation which pre-vented these mines being reopened. As a result of this discussion,the Secretary had asked the Assistant Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to take the initiative in reopening the question, and, ifpossible, to obtain.the assent of the French Government to reopen the mines.Propaganda byAeroplane,.22. With reference to a memorandum by Major StanleyWashburn, United States Army, under cover of a note by thein Scotland, the Ministry of National-Service, and the War Office^working together. Whilst very grateful for the 10,000 soldierspromised for the harvest, Mr. Munro said that these were not the skilled men most required. The men urgently needed were thosewho would save many small farms from becoming derelict.The Minister of National Service and the President of the Boardof Agriculture and Fisheries both stated that, as regards England, itwould not have been possible to call up to the full quota agreed on,as there were not sufficient Grade A men in the country, and even if no decision had been arrived at by the War Cabinet to cancelcalling-up notices, possibly not,more than 80 per cent, of the quotacould have been obtained. Sir Auckland Geddes also pointed out thatthe number of women employed in Scotland had gone down by 10 percent., whilst in England the number had increased by 19 per cent.Scotland had also been offered boys, and had refused, although, onreconsideration, that offer had been accepted to the extent of 2,000boys when arrangements had already been made for them to cometo England.Mr. Prothero said that if 1,000 men were to be released fromthe Army for Scottish agriculture, his position as President of theBoard of Agriculture for England and Wales would be impossible,unless he had the same concession.The War Cabinet decided that &apos;(a.) No men already called up from agriculture in scotland or towards the quota should be released from the Army.(o.) The Secretary of State for War should issue instructions that 10,000 soldiers should be made available for harvestwork in Scotland.
Secretary of. the War Cabinet (Paper G.T.-5193), and a memo-randum from-the Air Minister (Paper G.T.-5323), on the subject of propaganda by aeroplane, the Secretary stated that Lord Northclifienad informed him that he did not desire, in view of the remarks ofthe Secretary of State for Air, to press this question for the present.Future Business. : 23. A short discussion took place on the subject of futurebusiness and the days on which a meeting of the War cabinet should be held during the Parliamentary recess, and it was decided,subject to the approval of the Prime Minister, that The War Cabinet should not meet on Mondays unless there wasbusiness of urgent importance to attend to.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,August 7, 1918.
