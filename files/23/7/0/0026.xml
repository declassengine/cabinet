The Western Front. 1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that, owingto faulty telephonic communication with France, he had littleinformation with regard to General Byng&apos;s attack. Up to yesterdayafternoon, however, 2,000 prisoners and two guns had been captured.General Byng&apos;s first objective had been the far side of the railway,which ran parallel to our line in that sector, also Achiet-ie-Grand.General Byng, however, did not seem to have crossed the railway.Six German divisions had been identified in the attack, which werethe divisions we had expected to meet in that part of the line.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that theIHrd Corps attacked this morning between the Ancre and the Somme,but no details were yet available.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the French, . were on the line of the Oise at Pontoise. They had identified the seven German divisions they had expected to find in that sector.In reply to a question, the Chief of the Imperial General staff said that 2,000 prisoners was a fairly good haul, but it showed thatthe German line was being held very thinly.Guns for Czecho- 2. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that a telegram had beenSlovaks. received from H.M.S. &quot; Suffolk &quot; saying that the Czech Commanderhad requested that some of our 12-pr. and 8-inch naval guns shouldbe sent to the Manchurian front for use on train mountings. TheAdmiralty had referred to the War Office on the subject, and had decided that the Commander of H.M.S. &quot; Suffolk &quot; should consultGeneral Knox, who was expected to arrive at Vladivostock in a fewdays, on the matter.Air Piaid on 3. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that two machinesConstantinople.        left Mudros on the  night  of the   19th-20th  August to bombConstantinople.   Owing to thick weather, only one machine reached its objective, bombs being dropped on the Admiralty and vicinity.The other machine dropped bombs on Eregli and Rodosto.   Bothmachines returned safely.American Steamerin Collision with a submarine.4. The Deputy First Sea Lord said that an American steamerreported having been in collision with a submarine off the entrance to the Delaware River on the 18th August. The crew of thesubmarine hailed the steamer, saying, with a German accent, thatthey were friends. The steamer did not stop, but proceeded toBoston.The Czecho-Slovak 5. With reference to War Cabinet 462, Minute 3, Lord RobertForces. Cecil stated that he had cons\ilted Lord Reading about the action tobe taken with regard to President Wilson and the Czecho-Slovakforces. Lord Reading thought it would be inadvisable to send thetwo telegrams (No. 122 from Vladivostock, dated the 19th August,1918, and No. 28 to the War Office, dated the 19th August, 1918),with the preface that had been suggested, but advised that action should be taken with regard to a communication being sent fromMarshal Foch to the President. Lord Robert Cecil had alreadybeen in touch with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff on thissxubject, who woiild take the necessary action.
German Atrocitiesin South-WestAfrica.7. Lord Robert Cecil said that, in view of the recent speech ofthe German Colonial Minister, Dr. Self, it would be advisable for usto publish the document concerning the ill-treatment of natives byGermans in South-West Africa as soon as possible.The War Cabinet authorised Lord Robert Cecil to see the Under-Secretory of State for theColonies with a view to arranging for an early publication,of this document.Worn en&apos;s wages in Relation toMen!s:Omnibus andTramway Strike.8. Mr. Barnes explained the position which had arisen inconnection with the strike of certain transport workers employed onomnibuses and tramways in London, following upon dissatisfaction with an award recently made-by the Committee on Production. AConference of the Unions concerned was to be held that afternoon,and it would probably be agreed to resume work, subject to theCommittee on Production consenting to review their decisions ofthe Sth March and 9th July, 1918. The decision in July hadawarded 5s. to the men, and it was this award which the women were now claiming should be extended to them. But this particularstrike among the transport workers had raised a very far-reachingissue of what relation the State should recognise to exist betweenthe wages of men and women. The formula &quot; Equal pay for equalwork&quot; was as useless as that of &quot;No annexations, no indemnities.&quot;To give to women advances corresponding to those given to menduring the war would, it had been estimated, cost the country over1,000,0001. a week, and would probably lead to diminished output.The original basic wage of the women in the munition trades hadbeen taken at 20s., and they had been granted a rise of 4s., togetherwith a rise of 6s. on account of the high cost of living, making atpresent a wage of 30s. per week. The men had recently received an advance of 3s. 6d., which, together with the 5s. granted onaccount of the 12^- per cent, bonus, brought their war advances to28s. Qd. It had also been recently decided, but not announced, togrant all women over 18 years of age a further advance of 3s. Qd.(Is. 9d for those under 18), which would bring the women&apos;sadvances during the war to 13s. 6d., as compared with 28s. 6d. tothe men. There were approximately 1,000,000 women munition workers. Sir Stephenson Kent had prepared a Memorandum onthe whole question (Paper G.T.-5470), which he would read to theWar Cabinet.(Mr. Barnes read the Memorandum by Sir Stephenson Kent, whichis printed as an Appendix.)In his (Mr. Barnes&apos;s) view, what was immediately required wasa general examinatipn of the whole question of the relation ofwomen&apos;s wages to men&apos;s, and, pending the result of that enquiry,the proposed award of 3s. 6d. and Is. 9d. should be held up.Sir George Askwith said that the question&apos; of. the transportworkers would have to be dealt with on Monday next. TheExecutive of the Unions had agreed to advise the resumption ofwork, as Mr. Barnes had said, on condition that the Committee ofProduction would deal with the interpretation of their award of theSth March and the 9th July; but a new claim was put forward,namely, &quot; that equal total payment be made to women as to men for equal work in the tramway and omnibus undertakings who wereLeakage of 6. With reference to War Cabinet 460, Minute 3, relating to information. leakage of information, the War Cabinet decided that In view of the Secretary^ note on this subject (Paper G.T.-5440),it was unnecessary to take any further action.
parties to the awards of the 8th March and the 9th July.&quot; TheUnions also claimed that any present change of payment shoulddate from the beginning of the first full pay-day following the9th July, and that any future changes of payment should take placeconjointly wdth those of the men. The women were doing identicalwork with the men, but the Committee on Production werehampered, in considering the position, by the existence of the12J per cent, bonus, and as that had not been granted to womenmunition workers the Committee did not grant it to the wromen tram-way workers. The men were awarded 5s. as the equivalent of the12-jr per cent., and this was put on their basic rates. The womencomplained that this was the first time such a differentiation in the basic rates between men and women had been made. If the12^ per cent, and similar advances were to be considered as an addition to rates, then the women would demand the same basic rates as the men, and the demand would spread right through the munition trades. He suggested that it would be possible for theCabinet to meet the situation for the moment by applying to womenthe rule adopted for semi-skilled and unskilled men, as set forth inCircular L.3, namely : &quot; Where semi-skilled or unskilled male labour is employedon work identical with that customarily undertaken by skilled labour, time-rates and piece prices and premium bonus timesshall be the same as customarily obtain for the operations whenperformed by skilled labour,&quot;It could be justified by saying that the rule was being extendedto women on the ground that they had now served their apprentice-ship. By such an arrangement he thought the Government would get rid of about three-fourths of the trouble which was threatening.Mr. G. H. roberts said that, while it was clear the transportworkers&apos; case had to be settled immediately, he agreed that thewhole question of the relation of men&apos;s and women&apos;s wages ought tobe reviewed. The women had chosen the most favourable case for themselves in the present strike, as they were doing exactly thesame work as the men. In reply to a question, he said that if therewere a surplus of men and women available at equal rates, masterswould be inclined to choose men. This, no doubt, was realised bythe men who were fomenting the present conflict.Sir David Shackleton said that in the cotton trade women had always received the same rates and advances as men, and the argument that wages should be higher in the case of married menbecause of their responsibilities broke down when the case of the single men was compared with that of the single women. he believed that, on the merits, so far as the women affected by thepresent strike were concerned, the women would have got the 5s.had not the Committee on Production been concerned with theeffect of such an award on the munitions industries. They had therefore taken advantage of the employers&apos; plea that there wereadditional costs connected with the employment of women theywere less punctual and less continuous in their work. He was certain that the women now on strike would not go back on a merepromise of an enquiry.General Seely said ,that if, on the one hand, the womenthroughout munition areas claimed equal pay for equal work thecost to the State would probably be nearer 10O,00O,000Z. than50,000,OOOL, and there would be a loss of output. On the otherhand, a strike would also mean a serious loss of output. the sympathy of the press and of the public generally was clearly withthe women in the present struggle, and this was partly because alarge number of women who had tried this form of employmenthad been permanently disabled as a result. He did not think theGovernment could resist proportionate pay for proportionateproduction, and an effort should be made, on grounds of damage to
health, to differentiate the case of the ;bus and tramway women from that of the munition workers. To the latter an appeal shouldbe made on patriotic grounds, and it should be made plain to themthat the result of the adoption of equal pay for equal work wouldbe that many fewer women would be employed.Sir Stephenson Kent was of opinion that if Sir George Askwith&apos;suggestion were adopted it would be found impossible to limit the advances. If Circular L 3 were adopted the women would claimto receive all bonuses. He did not think the Government couldresist the demand for 5s. in the case of the women now on strike,but he suggested that the proposed enquiry into the whole questionof women&apos;s wages should be referred to a Sub-Committee of theCommittee set up lew the Ministry of Munitions to consider the trouble which arose at Coventry and elsewhere over the recentembargo. That Committee was presided over by Mr. JusticeMcCardie, and it had wide terms of reference, embracing the causes of industrial unrest. In bis view it would not be desirable to havea quite separate Committee dealing with women&apos;s wages. Therewere Trades Unions representatives on Mr. Justice McCardie&apos;sCommittee who would resent another and overlapping enquiry.Mr. Shaw said that the Tribunal on W omens Wages, over which he presided, had in certain&apos; cases conceded the principle ofproportionate pay for proportionate work. In Glasgow a demand hadbeen put forward by the women tramway conductors similar to that now being submitted in London, and his Tribunal had conceded thedemand, partly because in Glasgow there had been certain definitepromises of contracts, and partly because, on the whole, the women were doing work equal in quality and efficiency to that of the men,and at no greater cost to their employers. The Tribunal had refused in several cases to extend to women the 12^- per cent., on theground, inter alia, that it was not an absolutely general award. Inhis view, in the existing state of public feeling, it was extremelyundesirable to hold back the Munitions Order granting a further advance of 3s. 6c?. and Is. Od. to women. If it were held up indefi-nitely there wordd certainly be serious trouble.The War Cabinet were impressed with the grave importance ofthe issue which had been raised by the present strike, and with theimportance of thoroughly examining its ramiiications before definitelylaying down any governing principle which might have serious effects on the future welfare of women workers. It was also thegeneral view that the public would hardly be satisfied with an enquiry carried out by a Sub-Committee of an existing Committee.The public would not be satisfied with anything less than an ad hocbody, composed of persons carrying undoubted authority. It was recognised therefore to be desirable, if a separate Committee were set up, that the reasons for so doing should be made perfectly clear to Mr. Justice McCardie, so that he should have no legitimate ground of complaint.The War Cabinet decided (a.) That, in their view, the advance of 5s. ought to be concededto the women transport workers, and it was hoped that, the Committee on Production would deal with the disputesolely on the merits, and without regard to any reactionthe decision might have on other industries ;(6.) To ask Mr. Barnes to summon a conference of the Depart-ments concerned, to go into the question of a separateor a subordinate Committee of Enquiry, and to draw upthe terms of reference for the enquiry; Mr. Barnes toraise the matter at the War Cabinet if agreement werenot reached on the basis on an independent enquiry.(c.) That an announcement that the Government were arranging for an enquiry should be made at the same time as the
announcement of the award of the Committee on Pro-duction.(d.) To ask Mr. Barnes to inform Sir George Gibb, the Chairmanof the Committee on Production, of the above decisions.(Initialled) A. B. L.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,August 22, 1918.
APPENDIX.G.T.-5470.--Secretary, War Cabinet.I CIRCULATE a memorandum drawn up by Sir Steplienson Kent on the effecton wages and output in this Ministry of the recognition of the principle that women should be paid at the same rates as men.I am in substantial agreement with, the memorandum, especially in so far as itrefers to the probable effect on output, set forth on page 3, paragraphs (f) and (g).J. SEELY.August 20, 1918.Claim by Women Trans-port Workers for the same Wages and the same War Bonusesas Men.   Similar Claim by Women in Munition Industries.To the Minister,]. In connection with the memorandum submitted by the Minister of Labour as tothe wages of women transport workers, I think that the War Cabinet should know that the claim made on behalf of those women has also been made by the women in munition industries. The claim so far as the munition industries are concerned&quot;involves consequences so serious that I must emphasise the necessity of exercising thegreatest care in arriving at a decision on the case of the women transport workers soas not to prejudice the full consideration of the much wider problem of women on munitions work. Whatever decision be arrived at with- regard to women transportworkers, the considerations hereafter set out indicate that the application to munition works of the principle of the same rates and the same war bonuses for women andmen may have disastrous consequences.The Trade Unions representing women employed on munitions work applied tothe Ministry of Munitions in April last for an order that women on mens work shouldbe paid the same rates and the same war bonuses as men. This claim was inconsistent with the existing orders of the Ministry, both in respect of rates (except in the caseof skilled men&apos;s work) and war bonuses, and was refused. It has since been submittedto the Ministry of Labour with a request for arbitration, both by the women&apos;s TradeUnions on behalf of women on all men&apos;s work and by the skilled men&apos;s Unions inrespect of women on skilled mens work. The Minister of Labour is obtaining theopinion of the Law Officers on the question whether there is any right to arbitrationon a matter determined by Statutory Orders.The agitation for the present increase is a men&apos;s rather than a women&apos;s agitation.Its real object, in my opinion, is so to increase the cost of women&apos;s employment bothnow and after the war that employers will neither engage nor retain them.From the women&apos;s point of view, the agitation is unjustified (a) because thewages they now enjoy are extremely high. The average wages of women on munitions work are now not less than 300 per cent, in excess of the wages earned by women ofthe same class prior to the war.Women employed on skilled men&apos;s work are, under the orders of the Ministry,paid the same wages as men, subject to a deduction if they do part only of the men&apos;work, this being the condition on which the skilled Unions assented to dilution. Themens war bonuses given to meet the increased cost of living are now claimed inaddition for the women, on the plea that the payment to the women of the women&apos;swar bonuses instead of the men&apos;s war bonuses is a breach of the spirit of the condition,in that it enables employers to get the men&apos;s work done more cheaply by women.As, however, the expense of the war bonuses given to meet the cost of living areborne by the State and not by the employer there is no justification for this plea.The claim of the skilled men would imply that the bonus forms part of the rate andis, therefore, contrary to the understanding that the men&apos;s rates are not to be raisedduring the war. It is further contrary to the terms of the agreement with the skilled men as to women&apos;s wages,- and to the terms of the Committee on Production awardsrelating to men&apos;s war bonuses. If it were acceded to the resident must be to extend toall women on munitions work the full war bonuses given to men. The women onskilled men&apos;s work receive higher wages than any other women ; they have conse-quently less claim on the merits than any other women to an increased war bonus,and if they receive the men&apos;s war bonuses on theoretical grounds the claims of otherwomen for -at least as good treatment would be irresistible; (b) because, in general,
women employed on men&apos;s work are incapable of performing the same work as themen, and it would only be the rare exception that would be justified in claiming equal pay on the ground of equal work.The consequences in munition industries of accepting the principle that women on mens work must receive the same rates and the same war bonuses as men-wouldbe as follows : (a.) The application to all women on munitions work of the greater part of theincrease involved in the concession of the above principle to women onmen&apos;s work. AVhat is men&apos;s work in one establishment or district is oftenwomen&apos;s work in another establishment or district, and it would thereforebe impracticable to distinguish between the war bonuses paid to women employed on men&apos;s work and women&apos;s work respectively. In addition tothe payment of the same -war bonuses, it would be necessary to maintainthe present, relation between the wages of women on men&apos;s work andwomen on women&apos;s work, and if the wages of the former were raised tothe same figure as the men&apos;s, a consequential rise would have to be madein the latter also.(6.) The men already resent the high wages earned by women on certain classesof work. This further increase would inevitably lead to a further demand by the men.(c.) Approximately 1,000,000 women are employed on Ministry of Munitionscontracts. The increases would vary, but the average increase would amount on a rough estimate to 15s. per week at least.(d.) This increase, or the greater part of it, would inevitably extend to the largenumbers of women employed on private work in establishments only partlyengaged on munitions work. Few, if any, of these establishments couldbear this charge unless the State were to adopt the principle of subsidisingprivate industry. As employers could not pay similar increases to women on private work, either the discrepancy would be a little short of a scandalor employers with mixed contracts would have to throw up their munitions work.(e.) A similar increase woidd spread to the many women employed on war workwhich is not immediately within the scope of the Ministiy of Munitions ;for instance, the Woollen. Leather, and Cotton trades.(/.) A grave loss in output of munitions clue to lost time and diminished effort by women who would be guaranteed earnings greatly in excess of their actualneeds.(g.) A refusal by employers to retain or engage women on such terms which wouldin fact put a complete stop to dilution already seriously prejudiced by thewages now obtaining. This must lead to a grave position as regards man-power both for munitions and the army.. The general position of wages in the munition industries is now gravely disturbedand needs immediate examination.    Until that has been completed and remediesdevised for the present confusion a concession to the claims now made on behalf of&apos;women would endanger any reasonable solution of the whole problem of wages on munitions work for&quot; the remainder of the war.2. The difficulties as to women&apos;s wages on munitions work, are set out not because a decision on them is recpuired at the moment, though such a decisioncannot be long deferred. They are advanced to illustrate the grave trouble that a concession to the women transport workers&apos; demands might involve.% S. K.August 20, 1918.o
