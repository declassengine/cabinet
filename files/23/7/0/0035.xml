Murmansk andArchangel:Distribution ofFood.1. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs emphasised theimportance of the proper distribution of food at Murmansk andArchangel. He said that the Foreign Office had collected, with the help of the Ministry of National Service, some seventeen competentpersons, able to speak Russian, to undertake the work of distribution.It now appeared, however, that the War Office wished to use thesemen as sergeant interpreters. He therefore proposed that represen-tatives of the War Office and the Foreign Office should confer on thesiibject.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook to send arepresentative of the War Office to the Foreign Office inorder to discuss the matter.The Western 2  xhe chief of the Tmperial General Staff reported that a message had just been received that the British had taken 1,500prisoners at Mceuvres.General Wilson stated that the Americans, who had attacked inthe neighbourhood of St. Mihiel at 5 a.m. on the 12th instant, were now believed to have captured Vigneulles, advancing upon it fromthe north. If this news were true, it was possible that the whole ofthe &quot; pocket &quot; in that area, containing about five German divisions,might be taken. The Americans had employed between ten andthirteen divisions, out of a total of thirty-three American divisionsthat were fit to go into battle.General Wilson said that the prevailing opinion in France,whence he had just returned, was that, if the Germans were forcedto retreat still further, instead of taking the waterline of the Scheldtthey would draw a line from Lille to Metz, and then, after evacuatingFrance, make peace overtures to the French.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff explained, with the aid of a map, the various possibilities and difficulties of further Alliedadvance. Lille, for instance, was most strongly defended ; the st. Mihiel country was very difficult and presented great obstacles inthe way of feeding troops; the Plain of Wceuvre was a bog. Onthe other hand, the evidence of the last few weeks all tended to showthat no line could now be regarded as impregnable. Previously allsoldiers had been agreed that no real advance could be obtained on an arrow front, and that such an advance must be made on a front ofat least 20,000 yards, yet the Hindenburg Line had been broken ona front of 3,000 yards.Salonica.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet as to the plans of General Franchet d&apos;Esperey.Value of BigBattalions.4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that if anyfurther arguments were required in favour of the importance ofmaintaining big battalions, ample evidence had been furnished inthe case of the four Canadian divisions during the present summer.The Canadian battalions had been kept up to a strength of 1,100men each. Since July the four divisions had fought thirty-one german divisions, and whereas the four Canadian divisions were stillin existence, the thirty-one were forced into a state of being refitted.In this connection, two British officers had been sent down toexamine the condition of the French divisions, and to report.Marshal Foch claimed that he had 103 divisions, and on this basisurged that the British ought to keep sixty-one divisions. It hadbeen- found, however, that the French divisions, especially from st. Mihiel to the south, contained battalions of only two companies
Trans-Caucasia. 5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that a message had been received from the General Officer Commanding,Mesopotamia, to the effect that Colonel Pike had been killed. Hebad retired across the Caucasus, and had been trying to organise the Cossacks. Colonel Pike was a capable and useful officer, whohad supplied good information. If the news were true that he hadbeen killed it was probably a Bolshevist murder, as Colonel Pikewould not have been fighting.The Morning 6. The Chief of the  Imperial General Staff referred to an^0st&quot;i&apos;      n article by Lieutenaut-Colonel Repington, which had appeared inteuton the &quot;M.ornin  .Post&quot; on Wednesday, the 11th September, 1918.&quot;        &apos; The article, which had been written in Prance just after ColonelRepington had seen Marshal Foch, was of a very mischievousnature, containing, as it did, a paragraph in the sense that Englandwas not playing her part, and that the French knew it.The question of prosecuting the &quot; Morning Post &quot; Avas raised,but the opinion of the War Cabinet was that, as two days had now elapsed, it would be too late to take steps in this instance.With regard to the censorship of newspapers the First Lord ofthe Admiralty said he understood that, while items containing newswere censored, leading articles and other articles commenting onevents were not censored.The War Cabinet requested :- The ^chief of the Imperial General Staff to examine the questionof dealing with articles such as those by Colonel Repington,and to submit suggestions to the War Cabinet.The Steamshipil Galway Castle.:7. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that the steamship-&quot; Galway Castle &quot; had been torpedoed on the 12th instant, whenoutward bound, about 200 miles W.S.W. of the Scilly Islands. she had on board 207 crew and 734 passengers, including 400 Australianinvalids, 306 women and children, and Mr. Burton, the South AfricanMinister of Railways. H.M.S. &quot; Oriana&quot; and &quot;Spitfire&quot; were proceeding to Devonport with about 840 survivors, including mr.. Burton. In addition, H.M S. &quot; Minion &quot; had 39 survivors, and&quot; Garland &quot; 8. This would leave about 54 unaccounted for. It was reported that the back of the ship was apparently broken, and thatshe might break in two.Exchange ofPrisoners of War.8. With reference to Imperial War Cabinet 29, Minute 10, theFirst Lord of the Admiralty called the attention of the War Cabinetto telegram No. 2179, dated the 12th September, 1918, addressed by.the Foreign Office to Mr. Robertson at The Hague. Sir Eric Geddessaid that he clearly recollected that the War Cabinet had decidedthat, before there was any reversal of the existing decision, viz., thatthere was to be no exchange of submarine officers and men, thequestion should be referred to- the War Cabinet for further con-sideration and instructions. The telegram he referred to proposed toallow this exchange, and, as this was obviously against War Cabinetinstructions, Sir Eric urged that it should be corrected at once.each, and in some cases those companies were only 100 strong each. &apos;The divisions could, therefore, not be regarded as divisions at all, inthe proper meaning of the word.
The War Cabinet requested Lord Curzon to enquire into the matter, and authorised him totake such action as would prevent an exchange of submarineprisoners of war without further reference to the WarCabinet. *Russia : 9. With reference to War Cabinet 469, Minute 2, the secretary . Litvinoff. 0f state for Foreign Affairs called the attention of the War Cabinetto the dangerous position in which Mr. Lockbart, Mr. Wardrop, andother British subjects, official or otherwise, now in Russia, were in atthe present time. M. Litvinoff had been put in confinement, andMr. Balfour said he felt bound to ask the War Cabinet for then-direction as to what steps should next be taken. Mr. Leeper, whohad been responsible for all communications which had taken place between M. Litvinoff and the Foreign Office (M. Litvinoff neverhaving been recognised as the accredited representative of hisGovernment), had interviewed M. Litvinoff, and was strongly ofopinion that the British Government should release M. Litvinoffwith nothing but a bare promise from M. Chicherin that, in turn,British subjects would be released. The objection to this procedure was that the British Government would have no further hold on therepresentatives of the Revolutionary Government, and possibly, evenif the release were approved, the British citizens now in russia might still be assassinated. On the other hand, the Bolshevikswould not promise reciprocity, nor was any policy of simultaneousexchange possible except by arrangement with the Governments of norway and Sweden, which must necessarily take some time, andwould in any case be difficult to arrange. Mr. Balfour said that, onthe whole, he had considered there was a case for consideringthe expediency of the policy of carrying out the policy of trustingM. Chicherin to give a safe-conduct to British citizens afterM. Litvinoff had been released. A telegram had, however, beenreceived that morning from Mr. Clive at Stockholm, forwardinga telegram, dated the 7th September, from Mr. Wardrop, in which mr. Wardrop expressed the opinion that it would be fatal to letM. Litvinoff&apos; go until all British subjects had crossed the Russianfrontier.The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested that an exchangecould be effected at Archangel, where a natural frontier now existed.Mr. Leeper said that the Bolsheviks had already stated in theirwireless that they would not hear of au exchange at Archangel, wherehostilities were in progress. He had tried hard on the previous day to induce M. Litvinoff to send a telegram saying that he was going tobe released and sent home. M. Litvinoff had refused to send thisfrom prison, but had promised that if he were released for one day before sailing, so that he migho go to his home, collect his papers, and see his family, he would then send a telegram to M. Chicherin stating the facts with regard to his release, and possibly he might go as faras to urge the release of the British subjects to a neutral country.Asked if he would send another telegram on the eve of embarkation,he had replied that he would not, as he was just as much a prisonerin a British ship as when in this country. M.. Litvinoff had, however,said that, on landing at Bergen, he would give his parole to theBritish and Norwegian Governments until arrangements had beenmade with M. Chicherin for the release of British subjects. Accordingto M. Litvinoff, M. Chicherin desired to fulfil the conditions of release,and was not clamouring for the death of the British subjects, but every obstacle raised in this country made M. Chicherin&apos;s position, inthe face of the mob, more difficult.   In advising that M. Litvinoff* At a later stage it was reported by Mr. Warner, of the Prisoners of war department, that it was not intended that the telegram should bear the interpre-tation put upon it by the First Lord, but, in view of the ambiguity of the languageused, a further telegram had been sent to The Hague, in order to remove any possiblemisconception.
WC 472Proposed treaty between tbeUnited Kingdomand Brazil for tbeestablishment of a peace Commission.should be released, Mr. Leeper said that M. Litvinoff and his friendswere not of great value as hostages, none of them having been directly responsible for the crimes committed in Russia. Every day thatpassed endangered the lives of our people in Russia, and there was agood chance of their repatriation.Lord Curzon said he would be very reluctant to releaseM. Litvinoff. Undoubtedly the Russian Revolutionary Governmentwere most anxious for his release, and appeared to attach greatimportance to his return. Lord Curzon suggested that M. Litvinoffshould be sent to a port of sailing and kept there, and told that themoment information arrived that the&quot; British subjects bad crossed theRussian frontier he would be allowed to sail.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) Mr. Leeper should interview M. LitvinofF as soon as possible,and that if M. LitvinofF undertook on release to tele-graph M. Chicherin urging him to grant safe-conduct toall British subjects, official or otherwise, and all british naval and military officers now in Russia, he should be released at once and allowed to proceed, under policesupervision, to a port of embarkation(b.) On receipt of information that British subjects had crossed the frontier, M. Litvinoff should be given immediately a passage and safe-conduct back to Russia.10. With reference to Imperial War Cabinet 29, Minute 8, theWar Cabinet had under consideration the draft of a proposed treaty between the United Kingdom and Brazil for the establishment of a peace Commission (Paper P.-27), and a letter from the ForeignOffice and a note by the Lord Chancellor (Paper P.-27a).The War Cabinet took note of the draft of the proposed treaty, and left its consideration to the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.Tanks:Construction ofChateaurouxFactory.Situation inRussia andSiberia.11. The Wrar Cabinet bad under consideration Joint note no. 36 by tbe military representatives of the Supreme War Council,on the subject of the construction of Tanks at Chateau Roux factory.The Deputy Minister of Munitions said that the question of theconstruction of Tanks at this factory had been the subject of corre-spondence between the American, French, and British representatives.It had been agreed to hand over the management of this factory toMessrs. Pearson, and everything was now being done to put it on a proper basis. An agreement had been signed by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs and the American Ambassador, taking joint responsibility for this factory.The War Cabinet took note of Joint Note No. 36, and approvedof the decision of the Military Representatives to theSupreme War Council to take every step necessary inorder to carry out the proposals therein contained.12. The War Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff on the Situation in Russia and Siberia(Paper G.T.-5648).Strikepool.13 The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of ShippingCoalworkers ^ before ^ Cabinet a statement with reference to the coal-workers&apos; strike at Liverpool (Appendix). Sir Leo Money strongly urged that this statement should be published. W hile the proposed action was drastic, it was necessary in order that troops should not.be held up, and was recommended solely on that ground. it was most desirable that the public should know the facts and the reasonfor action.   The proposals had been approved by Mr. Sexton, the
Secretary to the National Union of Dock Labourers, who was eagerfor the proposed action to be taken.The First Lord of the Admiralty agreed that, if the War cabinet approved the action proposed, the statement should be made public as soon as possible. It was most important that the naval ratingswho were to be used to coal these vessels should be fully justified intheir action in the eyes of the public, and that there should be nosuspicion that they were being employed to assist traders for privateprofit.Some doubt having been expressed as to whether the employ-ment of service men to carry out this work might not create trouble in other industries, the Minister of Labour said that he did not fearthis result, the dock labourers themselves being entirely out of sympathy with the coal workers. Mr. Roberts also urged publica-tion of the statement, and said that he was convinced that a greatdeal of trouble has been caused in former labour disputes from thefact that the public were not aware in advance of the reasons forthe Governments action. The action proposed would undoubtedlystrengthen Mr. Sexton and his executive.The War Cabinet decided that Naval Ratings were to beemployed, and approved the publication of the statement as soon as the Naval Ratings had arrived at Liverpool,subject to the last paragraph reading as follows : -&quot; It should be clearly understood that, as is implied in what has been already stated, the Naval Ratings are being employed only to bunker ships proceeding to America and canada to bring back American and Canadian troops and government stores. No commercial end will be served bythe action, which is being taken solely in the interests ofpublic safety.&quot;Naval Ratings&apos; 14. With reference to the previous minute, the First Lord of the pay. Admiralty said that he had no reason to doubt that Naval Ratings would undertake this work, althorigh it would subject the men to a severetest. The Admiralty would be able to send 400 men for six or seven days, but if the strike continued for a longer period, further arrange-ments would have to be made. It was proposed to send a party of 400men to reinforce some 250 men who were already coaling ships flyingthe White Ensign. There had been considerable dissatisfaction withthe amount of the Admiralty allowance authorised for this work,namely, Is. a day, and Sir Eric Geddes urged that the treasury should give authority for the extra pay for this work, for all men employed, on it, being raised to 2s. a day.The War Cabinet approved that the amount of extra pay forall Naval Ratings coaling ships at Liverpool should be raised from Is. to 2s. a day.MilitaryProtection for naval Ratings,15. With further reference to Minute 13, the First Lord of theAdmiralty requested that the War Cabinet should authorise militaryprotection being given to Naval Ratings employed at Liverpool, ifnecessity arose. &quot;*.  The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for War should provide military protec-tion for Naval Ratings employed at Liverpool, if necessary.(Initialled)A. B. L.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,September 13, 1918.
APPENDIX.Liverpool Coalworkers&apos; Strike.THE Admiralty, the Ministry of Shipping, and the Ministry of Labour issue thefollowing statement :-On the 21st August an application was made by the National Union of DockLabourers and Riverside Workers in Liverpool for a revision of wages, and for certainalterations in the hours of labour for the men engaged in coaling vessels in the Port of liverpool. This application involved a revision of the award made by the Committeeon Production on the 3rd May, 1918, and arrangements were promptly made throughthe Ministry of Labour for the Committee on Production to hear the case on the 5thSeptember.The coalworkers, however, in defiance of custom and of the necessities of the case,refused to permit any overtime to be worked, thus seriously impairing the efficiency ofthe port and delaying the turn-round of troopships. The Committee on Production,therefore, could not hear the case until overtime working was resumed. The men were communicated with through their officials and the position explained to them, but theypersisted in their refusal to work any overtime.The arbitration, which had been fixed as stated above for the 5th September,had therefore to be postponed.On the 10th September the coal heavers ceased work in a body, entirely contrary tothe strong advice of the executive of their union.This action entails holding up all outward-bound vessels from the Port of Liverpool,including a large number of ships returning to the United States and Canada for thepurpose of bringing over American and Canadian troops.In these serious circumstances, and in order that the transport of the American and canadian troops shall not be delayed, it has been decided to employ naval ratings forthe purpose of coaling these vessels and getting them to sea to join their convoys.This decision has been forced upon the Government in view of the critical issues involved. The nation is making considerable sacrifices in order to bring as manyAmerican troops as possible into action on the Western front, and if the ships inquestion did not immediately proceed, the consequences would be extremely serious.It should be added that the Government Departments concerned have workedthroughout in unison with the men&apos;s responsible leaders, and the decision which hasbeen made has been communicated to Mr. Sexton, Secretary to the National Union ofDock Labourers and Riverside Workers of Great Britain and Ireland, who will conveyit to the men.There is no desire whatever to prejudice the merits of the men&apos;s case, and theCommittee on Production is prepared to arbitrate upon it within seven days of themen&apos;s resuming work.It should be clearly understood, that, as is implied in what has been already stated, the Naval Ratings are being employed to bunker ships proceeding to Americaand .Canada to bring back American and Canadian troops and Government stores.No commercial end will be served by the action, which is being taken solely in theinterests of public safety.
