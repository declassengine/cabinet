2Vladivostok. 1. WITH reference to War Cabinet 443, Minute 8, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff reported that the battalion at Hong Konghad been ordered to Vladivostok, but, so far, no answer had beenreceived from M. Clemenceau as to the number of French forces that would be available for use at Vladivostok. General Wilsonadded that the Japanese had given the Czecho-Slovaks 10,000Japanese rifles and 3,000,000 rounds of ammunition. He had alsotelegraphed to General Bridges, asking him to make enquiries Avithregard to the number of Russian rifles and the amount ofammunition that might be available in the United States.Withdrawal ofGerman troops from Salonica and palestine.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that therewere signs that the Germans were withdrawing troops from Salonicaand Palestine, although nothing definite was yet established.The Western 3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that evidenceFront, had been received that the Germans -were beginning to break up their divisions, and some of the divisions composed of older men had been put into the line for a second time without beingreinforced. General Wilson thought that the reason for this vrasthat it gave the enemy more opportunity of keeping their bestdivisions out of the line and training them. Recent evidence alsoshowed that there was no doubt that the German troops were suffering very much from influenza. In some cases prisonersreported that 50 or 60 per cent, of the units were down with the disease.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that news hadbeen received that twenty-four German heavy batteries were goingfrom Flanders opposite our forces at Kemmel. Aerial photographsshowed that hospitals, gun emplacements, dumps, &amp;c, were on theincrease between the Lys and the Somme.American Gunners.4. A suggestion was made that General Pershing should beasked to supply American gunners to man some of the Britishbatteries.The Chief of the Imperial- General Staff&apos; stated that Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig had asked General Pershing to supplyAmerican gunners for the three American divisions now behindKemmel, but, so far as General Wilson was aware, General Pershinghad not yet acceded to this request.A further suggestion was made that surplus guns might beplaced in rear of likely points of attack, but with only a few men to look after them, so that, in the event of an attack, gunners might be moved up from another part of the line to man these guns.The War Cabinet agreed that The Chief of the Imperial General Staff&apos; should consider boththe above suggestions, and, after enquiry, should take suchaction in regard to them as he deemed expedient.The Italian Front.5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theItalians were still doing well in Albania and were advancing towardsBerat.Submarines.6. The Deputy First Sea Ford stated that a United Statessubmarine had reported by wireless that she had engaged two enemy submarines, about 15 miles south of the Fastnet, on the evening of the 10th July, and probably damaged one of them.
7. With reference to War Cabinet 443, Minute 11, the WarCabinet resumed the dismission on the treatment of enemy aliens.Recommendation 10 of the Report of the Parliamentary group(Paper G.T.-5075), dealing with changes of name by persons of enemy origin, was first considered.Sir George Cave stated that the state of the law with regard to changes of name was very much in need of revision. Illustrationswere given of cases where persons, having changed their foreignnames, had obtained important positions in Government Depart-meuts ; some of these had recently been made public and had caused much feeling.It was agreed that No person not a natural-born British subject should be permitted to change his name without a licence, this ruleto be made retrospective for the period of the war.Recommendation 7 of the Report, dealing with persons of enemy origin employed in Government offices, was next considered.It, was explained that Civil Servants had no rights which they couldestablish against the State. They could be dismissed without any reason being given for such dismissal; but, in order to meet thecases of men who had served the State for a period of years andwere ordinarily entitled to a pension, arrangements could be madeto suspend their services during the war, and to recognise theirreasonable claims when peace was concluded.Attention was called to the demands of the public that persons of enemy origin should not be employed in Government offices, while no objection was taken to their serving in His Majesty&apos;s forces. Onthe other hand, it was urged that such persons employed in Govern-ment offices might have access to important information, whileopportunities of obtainiug information likely to be of value to theenemy were rare in the great majority of cases of those serving inthe forces. There was, further, a risk of leakage from government servants through their wives or other relatives who might be in communication with relatives in enemy countries. It was urged thatin time of war the State was bound to bear in mind that persons of enemy origin resident in this country might not be able completelyto resist &quot; the call of the blood.&quot;Mr. Churchill deprecated action on the lines of the Reportof the Parliamentary group, which would react very detrimentallyon the Ministry of Munitions, both as regards scientific experts and civil Servants. Pie thought that persons in the service of the Govern-ment could be left to be dealt with by the responsible heads of thedepartments. In order to quiet the public feeling which had beenaroused, he was in favour of a searching review being carried out,but he was strongly opposed to any injustice being perpetrated in response to a clamour in the press. No one had proved that thecountry was in serious danger, and he was convinced that our secret service was more efficient than that of the Germans. His experiencewhen Home Secretary and First Lord of the Admiralty had shownthat the dangerous agents were not enemy aliens, but members ofother nationalities. In the Civil Service there were men of enemy origin occupying high positions, who throughout the war had been working most loyally, and who were held in the very highest regardby their colleagues. It would be most unfair to deal harshly withsuch men. There were, further, scientific men, chemists, andothers, who were very valuable to the State at the presenttime. There were others in the munitions industries inpositions which might,  be compared with those   of  regimentalThe AlienQuestion:Position of persons of Alien Birth.Admiral Hope also reported that an Italian submarine claims tohave torpedoed a small enemy submarine in the Northern Adriaticon the 5th duly.
officers. Lastly, there were the cases of men of German originwho were coming over in the American Army. He was aware that the present agitation was widespread, and that particular cases would be ruthlessly forced on any tribunal set up, but he was equally certain that any panic measures resorted to now would bemuch regretted by the Government later on. He hoped that itwould be stated clearly in the House of Commons that the Govern-ment did not admit that they had been in any way censurable intheir administration of the laws against enemy aliens.It was recognised that it would be impossible for the americans to get rid of the German elements in their services, and that theposition of America as a land of adoption, rather than as a land of birth, constituted an important difference when compared with thiscountry or with France.In reply to a question, General Macdonogh and Admiral Hallagreed that there was nothing in the present situation with regardto the activities of enemy aliens which, in their opinion, called forspecial measures.Mr. Munro suggested that to recommendation 7 of the reports limiting clause might be added similar to that in recommenda-tion 1, viz., &quot; unless there is definite national reason for exemption.&quot;With reference to the case of Government employment, theWar Cabinet decided that (a.) No one should be employed in Government offices ordepartments during the war unless he is the son of natural-born British or Allied subjects, but exceptionmight be made for definite reasons of national importance.(b.) A special tribunal should be set up to judge these cases,and on the tribunal there should be a preponderance oflaymen.With reference to the proposal made on the previous day thatthe whole of the United Kingdom should be proclaimed as aprohibited area, the War Cabinet approved the following alternativearrangement, which had been concerted between Sir George Caveand General Macdonogh : The rule which required aliens in prohibited areas to possessidentity books should be applied to aliens in all parts ofthe country.russians in the 8. With reference to War Cabinet 372, Minute 17, attentionEast End. was called to the large number of Russians in the East End,amounting to between 30,000 and 40,000, who were living in veryinsanitary conditions, and who it was desirable should either besent back to Russia or enlisted.No decision was reached on this subject.Treatment of enemy Aliens.Bestriction ofEnemj Businessafter the War.Banks.9. With reference to War Cabinet 443, Minute 12, it wasagreed that few things would do so much to allay public feelingwith regard to enemy aliens as a refusal to permit them to re-openbanks in this country after the war, and that it would be useful to let the Germans have an example of the measures of economicboycott which this country might adopt against them. The bankswere the very centre of the system of German economic penetration,and public opinion would probably welcome the isolation andcontrol of this dangerous form of penetration.
Enemy-ownedPatents.10. With reference to AVar Cabinet 443, Minute 12, the WarCabinet approved the draft reply of the President of the Board ofTrade to a Parliamentary question dealing with enemy-ownedpatents, trade-marks, and designs (Paper G.T.-5070).Sinking of hospital Ships:Statement in theHouse ofCommons.11. It was agreed that the Secretary of State for Home Affairs,in his general statement on the treatment of enemy aliens, in theHouse of Commons that afternoon, should call attention to the factthat much of the anti-German feeling widespread in the country atthe present time had been produced by outrages against humanitylike that of the sinking of the hospital ship &quot; Llandovery Castle,&quot;which engendered a state of public anger that was impossible tocontrol, and might continue long after the end of the war.Hospital Ships:Eeprisals.12. With reference to AVar Cabinet 441, Minute 8, the AVarCabinet had before them a note by Mr. Chamberlain on the subjectof using some form of economic threat as a reprisal for such action as the sinking of hospital ships (Paper G.T.-5051). In his note,Mr. Chamberlain pointed out that he was of opinion, firstly, thatthe economic threat, unless preceded or accompanied by definiteaction on the part of the Empire and the Allies, would not be effective; and, secondly, that when the Empire and Allies wereprepared for definite action in this field, the weapon was too good a one to be blunted by use in minor questions of reprisals.Mr. Chamberlain said that, if the Cabinet should so desire,he could bring this matter before the Economic Defence andDevelopment Committee, although, for the reasons given above, he himself did not recommend this course.The \Arar Cabinet decided that In the circumstances, it was unnecessary to proceed further inthe matter.Leakage of 13. The attention of the AVar Cabinet was drawn to severalInformation. recent cases of leakage of official information, the latest of whichhad appeared in the press that morning.The AVar Cabinet instructed The Secretary to issue a notice to the Heads of all GovernmentDepartments, to be communicated by them to all Under--Secretaries, Private Secretaries, and all public servantsholding positions giving them aceess to confidential information, acquainting them that, on the next occasion of a case of leakage in the press or otherwise, powers would be exercised under the Defence of the realm regulations to trace the leakage to its source.The War Cabinet decided To sanction tbe recommendation of the President of the Boardof Trade that for a period of five years after the war enemy aliens should not be permitted to carry on the business ofbanking in the United Kingdom, except under a systemof licences.
6N.B. For convenience of reference, the relevant extracts fromthe Defence of the Realm Manual are given below: &quot;27 a. . . . It shall not be lawful for any person in anynewspaper, periodical, circular or other printed publication, orin any public speech, to publish any report of, or to purport to describe, or to refer to, the proceedings at any meeting of theCabinet, or without lawful authority to publish the contents ofany confidential document belonging to, or any confidential&apos; information obtained from, any Government department, orany person in the service of His Majesty.&quot; If any person contravenes any provision of this regulationhe shall be guilty of an offence against these regulations.&quot;&quot; 43. No person shall obstruct, knowingly mislead, orotherwise interfere with or impede, or withhold any information in his possession which he may reasonably be required tofurnish, from any officer or other person who is carrying outthe orders of the competent naval or military authority, or whois otherwise acting in accordance with his duty under these regulations, and if he does so shall be guilty of an offence against these regulations.&quot;&quot; 53. It shall be the duty of any person, if so required byan officer, or by a soldier or sailor engaged on sentry patrol orother similar duty, or by a police constable, to stop and answer to the best of his ability and knowledge any questions whichmay be reasonably addressed to him, and if he refuses or fails to do so he shall be guilty of an offence against these regula-tions. The competent naval or military authority may byorder require any person or persons of any class or descriptionto furnish him, either verbally or in writing, with such informa-tion as may be specified in the order, and the order may require any person to attend at such time and such place as may be specified in the order for the purpose of furnishing such information, and if any person fails to comply with the orderhe shall be guilty of an offence against these regulations.&quot;14. The War Cabinet had before them a report of the Corn-mittee on the Trade Relations of the United Kingdom within theEmpire (Paper G.T.-4903), together with a memorandum byMr. Long (Paper G.T--5057) with regard to Preference on ExistingDutiable Articles.In his memorandum Mr. Long suggested that it was desirablethat the report from the Trade Relations Committee should beadopted with the least possible delay by the War Cabinet, and referred to the Imperial War Conference.The view was expressed that some uncertainty existed in the minds of the Overseas Members of the Imperial War Conference asto what the attitude of the British Government was with regard tothe policy of Imperial Preference agreed in 1917 at the imperial war Cabinet, and whether perhaps the policy had not been changed.Further, it was suggested that the proceedings of the imperial war Conference were, to some extent, hampered by lack of any indication from His Majesty&apos;s Government as to what they proposedto do in the matter of preference.Owing to the lateness of the hour, the Wrar Cabinet were ofopinion that the matter could not be settled forthwith, but that itshould be put down for discussion at an early meeting of the WarCabinet, and that later it should be brought before the imperial war Cabinet.Preference onDutiable Articles.
Priority and 15. The War Cabinet had before them the recommendations of allocation of. ^e Economic Defence and Development Committee in regard to theP sf &quot;^Period       problem of priority in the post-war period.The Committee recommended to the War Cabinet (etc) That the appointment of a Posi-War Priority Committee, onthe lines proposed by the Minister of Reconstruction, be approved ;(b.) That the Committee should consist of the Chairman of theWar Priorities Committee (General Smuts) as Chairman,the President of the Board of Trade, the Minister of reconstruction, the Minister of Labour, the Minister ofMunitions, and the Minister of Shipping ;(c.) That the Minister of Reconstruction should make a public announcement on the subject at an appropriate time, inthe terms proposed by the Drafting Committee.The War Cabinet approved these recommendations.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.,July 11, 1918.
