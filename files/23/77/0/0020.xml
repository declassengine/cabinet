Today they would pass a First Reading of the Agricultural marketing bill, which would be circulated on the following day, mhursday, December 14th.    The NewfoundlandBill wotild come to the Rouse of Lords on the night of Monday, December 18th, and, by calling a special meeting of the House, which would not be popular,it would be possible to receive the Bill and. for itto be circulated on ^uesday, December 19th.Tuesday the 19th had already been hypothecated, tothe Bill for the Reform of the House of Lords, tobe introduced by Lor-d Salisbtary.    ^hat left only two days for the Agricultural Marketing Bill andthe Newfoundland Bill.    He thought the Rouse of lords would have strong objections to being expected topass two Important Bills on Wednesday the 20th andThursday the 21st December.The Prime Minister expressed regret that nobusiness had yet reached the House of Lords and thathis attention had not been called, to the matter.It was suggested that,  judging from experience in the House of Commons, the Agrietiltural marketing bill was not likely to prove controversial in theHouse of Lords.At the request of the Cabinet the Secretary ofS^ate for War, as Leader       the House of Lords,
To do his best to induce the Houseof Lords to pass the NewfoundlandBill in any event:As soon as he himself had seen theAgricultural Marketing Pill, to get in touch with the appropriate authorities, through the usual channels, with a view to securingthe passage of the Bill, if possible,before Christmas:^o report the results of his enquiries to the Cabinet.
3. The Cabinet bad before them the following-documents on the subject of Reduction and Limitationof Armaments :-A Report by the Ministerial Committee(C.P.-291 133))  on the TechnicalAspect of the German DisarmamentProposals tA Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (C.P.-294(33)) reporting recent actionregarding Disarmament:A Note by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs  (&quot;CP.-299 (.33))covering the most important telegramsthat had recently been exchanged withHis Majesty&apos;s representatives in Paris,Berlin and Rome on the DisarmamentPos ition.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed his colleagues that within the last houror two a document had been received from Berlingiving in some detail Herr Hitler&apos;s views onForeign Office Telegram No.238,  of December 7th,from the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs to Sir E. Phipps  (Berlin), sent after discussion at the Ministerial Committee on Disarmament.    he himself had not yet had an opportunity of studyingthis Paper, which would have to be considered by the ministerial Committee on Disarmament.    The&apos; FrenchGovernment, which was now rather stronger after thepassage of Its Finance Bill by the Chamber, hadtaken uip as a definite line of policy &quot;No re-armament by Germany&quot;, and. were likely to press uson this point.   He himself was thinking of soarranging his Christmas recess as to enable him topass through Paris and see M. Paul-Boncour, andpossibly also to include a visit to Italy.    HisMajestyfs Ambassador in Berlin, from whom he had heard privately, did not encourage an early visit to that Capital.
The discussion at the Cabinet turned mainly onthe nature of the communication to be made to theFrench Government on the subject of the French dossieron German re-armament (C.P.-294 (5,3), Para . (6)) .The Cabinet agreed  (a) That, in view of the great importance which the French Government have forsome time past attached to the questionof an exchange of vie^&quot;s  on their dossieron German re-armament,  it was essentialto make some response to their repeatedreques ts:(b) That any communication to the FrenchGovernment should be made through apolitical rather than a militarychannel,  partly in order to avoid being drawn into detailed discussions in whichit might be difficult not to disclose the sources  of our information, andpartly because any information givenwould be considered by the French Cabinet:(c) -hat the Ministers at the head of theDefence Departments ^should inform theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs as to what part of the French dossieron German re-armament we were in aposition to confirm, and what were the items (if any) which we could not confirm:(d) -hat the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, or his representative, should then see the French Ambassador and makea verbal communication to him of theresults of the examination of the Frenchdossier by the Defence Departments.Fis general line should be to say thatthe French information was rather similarto our own, except that on certain points ,which he would specify, our informationdid not. support theirs.    As far aspossible he should avoid disclosingdifferences of detail, such as thenumber of a particular weapon which germany was believed to have, and. should confine his  observations to pointing outsimilarities or differences in rathergenera.1 terms :(e) That in making, the above communicationthe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should make the following pointsclear:-(i) -hat this information is given in a friendly and almost informal manner and solely in order to respond to the desire of the FrenchGovernment to know how far our information agreed with&apos; theirown:
(ii) That the information is of sucha character that it -would bevalueless for public use atGeneva or elsewhere:(iii) That it must not be regarded as a first step towards opening upArticle 213 or any other article of the Treaty of Versailles or ofthe Treaty of Locarno:(iv) That there can be no question ofour discussing such issues unless and until we had fully tried out our policy of reaching a Disarma-^  ment Contention:.........________(f) That the Ministerial Committee on disarmament should meet at 10 downing street on FRIDAY, DECEMBER 15th at10 a.m. to consider Herr Hitler&apos;observations on Telegram No.238to Sir E. Fhipps  (Berlin) of December7th, 19 33:(g) That, with a view to a discussion ofthe wider questions of Disarmament,such as the possible amendment ofthe Covenant of the League of Nations;the policy to be adopted by thiscountry towards Germany:    the Germanproposals for dealing with the Saar,U/(3U)/. etc., the following dispositions shouldbe made:-(i) The Secretary of State should prepare a Memorandum summarising the different proposals that hadbeen made:(ii) January 10,  1934, should befixed as a provisional date for a Meeting of the ministerial committee on D isarmament.
Iew cunarpIference:linet 49lg). Con-conclusion S.)4.  The Cabinet had before them a Most secret memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(CP.-293 (33))  informing them of the progress ofthe negotiations relating to the completion of thenew Cunard liner known as &quot;No.534&quot;, and outlininga scheme which was ready to be brought to fruitionsubject to acceptance by the Cabinet and subsequentratification by Parliament of the financial provisions,and by the ordinary debenture-holders of the Oceanicand Cunard Companies.    If his proposals commendedthemselves to the Cabinet the Chancellor of theExchequer intended to arrange -for a Question to beasked in the House at once and to reply broadly inthe following terms :-&quot;I am glad to say that these difficult and complicated negotiations, con-ducted with great goodwill on all sides, have reached a stage at whichthe Government feel justified in assuming that an effective mergerof the North Atlantic fleets of the cunard and White Star Lines willbecome an accomplished fact at anearly date.    It is the intention ofthe Government in that event shortly to lay before the House proposals forfurnishing the necessary finance forthe completion of the new Cunard linerknown as No.534&quot;.Attached to the Memorandum was an Appendix containing the proposed terms for the financing of the linernand of a complementary ship I or ships) on analogousterms .-he President of the Board of Trade, while notopposing the Answer which the Chancellor of theExchequer proposed to make in the House of Commons,asked to place on record that he was opposed to thepolicy of constructinp: No.534 for the followingreas ons:-
(l) Important as the Worth Atlantic(United States) shipping rotite was,technically it was not an Empire route,and from this point of view was less important than the services to India,Australia, south Africa and Canada.(2) No.534 was too large a ship and wasnot likely to be a financial success:consequently we should probably beasked to help the Company when it got into difficulties.(3) We had already gone a long way inassisting the Cunard Line by guaran-teeing  2,000,000 of the insurance ofNo.534, - the only British ship thusfavour ed.(4) ^he Anchor Line, an important subsidiaryof the Cunard Company,  is in defaulton its Trade Facilities guarantee.This wrould increase the difficulty of defending the new proposals.(5) The Cunard Company wanted to build asecond ship.    If this were done, thetotal expenditure would amount to thefollowing:-Completion of No.534 ...  3,000,000Working Capital ...       1,500,000A new Ship ...        5.000.000Total      9.500.000.(6) By comparison he drew attention to therequest of about 1,400 tramp steamersfor a subsidy this year to tide the mover this crisis up to  3,000,000.The Chancellor of the Exchequer regretted thatthe President of the Board of Trade held a differentview, though he thought the difference was not so great as it appeared.    He himself was as strongly opposed, as his colleague to indiscriminate subsidies.Occasionally, however, private interests were notable to put themselves in a strong position without some outside assistance or stimulus, which sometimesmight be piven by the Government.   This was a casein point.    ^h.e position in the North Atlantic wasthat the Cunard and White Star Lines were cuttingeach other&apos;s throats and both were likely to bleedto death.    If that happened the Government would lose 2,250,000 from advances made (including  1,250,000advanced by the Government of Northern Ireland,
who would come down on the Government of the UnitedKingdom to help them out).   The construction ofNo.534 had been used as a leve^ to bring about the amalgamation of these two Lines and to enable the amalgamation largely to control the shipping of theNorth Atlantic.    If other schemes were put forwardhe would have to apply the same tests, consideringeach case on its merits.    If convinced that the endjustified the means he would not rule out government assistance in other cases .   -hat was his reply onthe point of the North Atlantic (United States)route not. being an Empire route.     As yet he hadreceded no application for assistance for otherroutes,As regards the size of the Ship he pointed outthat Lord Essendon, who at first had thought thatNo.5?4 could not pay, was now confident that itcould.    Lord Weir had always taken the same view,-he previotts insurance was not relevant if thefirst part of his Answer was accepted.    He thoughtthat the loans to one of the subsidiaries  of theOunard Line ought not to be used as an argument against his present proposal.    It was true that the cunard Line had bought Ordinary Shares in theAnchor Line, but now they had. written them off.As to the second Ship, this could not be builtwithout sanction of the Government.    It was not necessary to assume that the Government would haveto guarantee its construction,   -he Board of theAmalgamated Company might take the President of theBoard, of -rade&apos;s view that it was not desirable tobuild a second Ship;    or. alternatively, the Shipmight be a great success, in which case they mightbe able to raise the money without. government assistance.    In any event the maximum of  9,500,000
calculated by the President of the Board of Trade,was a capital sum which had. to be compared with 5,000,000 per annum proposed, for the trampsteamers .The Cabinet agreed  (a) mo approve the Answer to be givenby the Chancellor of the exchequer to a Question to be asked in theBouse of Commons, in the terms setout at the head of this Conclusion,subject to(b) consideration by the Chancellor ofthe exchequer as to whether he wouldsubstitute, in the third line fromthe end, the words &quot;financial facilities&quot;for &quot;finance&quot;.
5In the course of the discussion referredto in the preceding Conclusion, the President of theBoard of Trade raised the question as to what linehe was to take in the House of Commons the same after-noon when the general question of the state of theBritish Mercantile Marine was to he considered.This opened up a discussion on the Government&apos;s policy on the subject.    He referred to C0p.-29P (33),. circulatedto the Cabinet on the previous evening.The Cabinet agreed -(a)    That in the debate the same afternoonthe President of the Board of trade might usefully take the following line:-(l)    To give on behalf of the government description of the salient features of the situation.(2)    To repeat the statement that he andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer hadalready made to the effect thatthe Government were not preparedto permit a collapse of Britishmercantile shipping.(3)    To point out that there was considerabdiversity of views in the shippingcommunity (e.g.   the United KingdomChamber of Shipping and the LiverpoolOwners Association) and to suggestthat the industry ought itself toreach agreement,  in which event their proposals would receive sympathetic consideration by the Government.(4)    To announce that a strong CabinetCommittee had been formed to considerthe whole question.(b)      That a Cabinet Committee composed asfollows -The President of the Board of Trade(In the Chair)The Lord President of the council the Chancellor of the exchequer the Secretary of State for DominionAffairsThe Secretary of State for the colonies the Secretary of State for india the First Lord of the admiralty should meet to consider the presentposition of the British Mercantile Marine.
$RIALIce.ffion or&quot;Ivate Arffl-&apos;ntsiustry mevious-fere nee:binet 272), Oon-ulion 6,;6.      The Cabinet had before- them the Report of theCommittee on the Private Armaments &quot;Industry (C.P.-289(33)), which had been appointed at the meeting referred to in the margin.The Cabinet first.discussed the proposalsof the Cabinet Committee for the modificationof the present system of licensing exports of-arms and ammunition.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs drew attention to Paragraph 13 of CP.  289 (33)and to the letter by the Foreign Office inAppendix II to that document setting out theobjections of the Foreign Office to the proposalsof the Cabinet Committee.      He recalled, inparticular,  that the Cabinet had decided on the8th February last that the United Kingdom delegation at Geneva should continue their opposition to any system of international licences, but should support^the inclusion in the Convention of a system ofnational export licences such as is already inforce in this country.        He agreed that other nations had not followed our example in thisrespect.      Nevertheless, from the point of viewof the Disarmament Conference the new proposal was a formidable one.      If the course v/as a rightone the National Government was strong enoughto stand by it, but he would ask that its defence should be entrusted not to the Foreign office representatives in Parliament who had usually hadto deal with such matters, but to those who were concerned with the defence and trade interestsfor the benefit of which the innovation was intended.-12-
The Cabinet were reminded, that the . result -ofour policy up to date had been to throw British workmenon the streets without stopping other countries frompiling up arms.      It was suggested that the policyof the Government could be defended on those lines.Some discussion took place as to when thechange in policy should be announoed and as to theterms of the announcement.      It was suggested that perhaps no immediate announcement; was necessary andthat for the moment it might be sufficient to notify the armaments firms confidentially that achange in the form of the licence was contemplatedand that they could apply for the new licences.Whenever the announcement was made it would be important to avoid specifying the countries to beexcepted from open licences, viz:    Abyssinia, Germany,Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria, and to use some phrasesuch as that open licences would be issued &quot;for every country except in cases where we are bound by treatynot to supply war material.&quot;On the question of export credits,  the Cabinetv/ere reminded that orders had been lost and were likely to be lost in the near future to the armamentsindustries of certain countries which granted export credits.      The political objections, however, were considered to override any advantages that might heobtained from the proposals of the Committee.The Cabinet, agreed -(a)    Modification of the present system of licensing exports of arms and ammunition.(1)    To approve in   principle the foil owingrecommendations of the Cabinet committee as set forth in CP.  289 (33):-
(i) That provision he made for the issue to armament manufacturers, who are approved by the Service Departments asbeing of national importance, of openlicences covering the; export of all war material to such foreign Govern-ments  (or their accredited agents)as are recognised by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment with the exception of theGovernments of Abyssinia, Germany,Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria.    every such licence should be subject toconditioxis framed so as to ensure -(a) that the manufacturers to whomthe open licences are issuedshould supply the Service Depart-ments with information regardingorders for war material forforeign Governments,  in such manner and at such times as theDepartments may require;    and(b) that all material exported underthe open licences should be pre-entered with the Customs seven days before shipment, and thatat the time of pre-entry,  theinformation specified inparagraph 41 of the Sub-Committee!sReport (Appendix I) should be furnished to the Customs.That,  if recommendation (i) is approved,the High Commissioners for the Dominionsa*nd--*&amp;&amp;lH and the Crown Agents for theColonies should be consulted on the subsidiary question of modifying thepresent system in regard to theDominions,  India and the Colonies.(iii) That the condition attached, to the issueof every export licence for war material,empowering the Board of Trade to revokeor modify the licence at any time, should,in the case of open licences granted to manufacturers, be qualified by a state-merit that His Majesty&apos;s Government haveno intention of exercising that powerexcept in cases where manufacturers inreceipt of open licences have brokenthe conditions on which the licencesv/ere granted, or in the interests ofImperial security, or in pursuance ofan international agreement to which HisMajesty&apos;s Government are or may become a party.(2)    That the President of the Board of Tradeand the Ministers of the Defence services should consider both in its ijoliticalfind technical aspects the question of when this policy ought to be announced and advise the Cabinet in due course on thesub ject.
(3)    That when any announcement was madecare should he taken not to specifythe particular countries which wereexcepted from the open licence andit should be made clear that thelicence would apply to every countryexcept in cases where we are bound by treaty not to supply war material.Export Credits.That the political objections outweighedthe advantages of the proposal that munitions of war should not henceforth be excluded fromthe export credits guarantee scheme.
7. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Rome Secretary (C.P.-292 (33)) stating that, inaccordance with a promise given in the King&apos;s Speech^arrangements were being made to introduce and read a first time on December 21st a Bill dealing with thehours of employment of young persons and other conditions in the distributive trades.   The HomeSecretary&apos;s recommendation was that the hours ofemployment for younp persons should be fixed at a weekly maximum of 52, with a yearly allowance of24 hours&apos;  overtime, subject to a provision for reduction after three years to a weekly maximum of48 with a yearly allowance of 50 hours&apos;  overtime.The Prime Minister pointed out that in the short time available able that morning it was impossibleofto settle the question/hours    of employment whichwould require careful consideration.- The Home Secretary agreed.      He said he had only brought this Bill forward because he understoodthat the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurydesired that the Bill might be ready on the firstorder for the reassembly of Parliament after the recess.       Prom the statement made by the PrimeMinister earlier in the meeting he gathered that other arrangements had been made.        In thecircumstances the Cabinet agreed -To adjourn the consideration of the shops Bill.
