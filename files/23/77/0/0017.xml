THE AMrRICANDEBT .The EconomicSituation inthe UnitedStates ofAmerica.Statement bySir frederick leith-Ross .(previous reference:Cabinet 64(-33), Con-elusion 10.)1. The Prime Minister welcomed Sir frederick leith-Ross, Chief Economic Adviser to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, on his return from Washington,    if sir Frederick was inclined to feel thft he had comeback with empty hands, he coulr1 assure him that theCabinet did not share any regrets he might have.He and his colleagues realised th^t a permanent settlement had been out of the question in presentconditions in the United States, and on behalf of theCabinet he thanked him for the conclusion of asatisfactory temporary settlement.   He then asked sir Frederick for his appreciation of the situationin the United States .Sir Frederick Leith-Ross then gave the cabinet an appreciation of the situation in the United Statesof America, first as regards War Debts, and secondlyfrom the point of view of the general financialposition (Appendix) .
AIR DEFENCE.Strength ofthe Royal AirForce .(previous reference:Cabinet 61(35), Conolu-sion 6.)2. The Prime Minister raised, as a matter of urgency, the following Resolution to be moved inthe House of Commons the same afternoon:-Rear-Admiral Sueter, - Air Defence, -to call attention to the inadequacy of the present provision made for theAir Defence o^ this Country, the Empire,and our Imperial communications:    andto move, that this Ho\ise views with grave disquiet the present inadequacy of the provision made for the air defence of these islands, the Empireoverseas, and our imperial eommunica-tions:    that it welcomes the insistencewhich, the British delegation have through-out laid at Geneva on this Country&apos;sneed for a one-Power standard in the air:and., whilst supporting the endeavoursof His Majesty&apos;s Government to secureparity primarily by means of a reductionin the strength of those Foreign airforces which at present so largely out-number our own, urges them to takewithout delay such other remedial measures as are open to them and, in particular,to consider the early completion of theHome defence force decided on in 1923as the minimum necessary for our national security and approved by each successiveadministration since that date.He said that he had discussed the matter with theParliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, who had suggested that the Government might accept theRes olution,The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs raised doubts as to whether it was desirable at this moment to accept a Resolution which would not helpforward that urge towards disarmament which theGovernment&apos;s policy necessitated.The Secretary of State for Air pointed out thatMotions of this kind, brought forward by personsclaiming considerable technical knowledge, were amatter of some embarrassment.    He was told that ithad been suggested that the present Motion had beenstimulated by the Air Ministry,    ^here was absolutely!no truth in any such charge.    Some of the personsin Parliament who were interested in Air Defencejquestions were in close touch with the Air Ministry,
but so far as representatives of the Ministry hadanything whatsoever to do with Resolutions of thiskind, it was to exercise a moderating influence.Nevertheless, the phraseology of Admiral Sueter&apos;resolution was admittedly rather awkward.    It wouldrequire an adroit speech, which he thought theParliamentary Under-Secretary could be relied on tomake.   Broadly speaking, he would, base himself on thefollowing extract from a speech made by the lord president of the Council at Birmingham on October 6th:-&quot;When I speak of a disarmament convention I do not mean disarmamenton the part of this country and not onthe part of any other.    I mean thelimitation of armaments as a real limit-ation, such a one that is real by thegestures made for disarmament, and if we find ourselves on some lower rating andthat some other country has higher figures,that country has to come down and we go up until we meet&quot;.It had been admitted that we had disarmed to the edge of risk, and the Air Ministry were, therefore,entitled to claim that from a technical point of viewthey were not satisfied with the present position ofthe Royal Air Force.    He himself had hoped at onetime to be able to obtain a decision from the Cabinetwrhich would, enable him to announce that the completionof the Home Defence Air Force was to be proceeded with,but he recalled that at the Meeting referred to in the margin the matter had been postponed.    The most awkwardpart of Admiral Sueter&apos;s Motion v/as the suggestionthat the present provision made for Air Defence was inadequate.    He thought that this suggestion shouldbe boldly met.    We should admit that we had disarmedto the edge of risk and had done it deliberately in pursuit of a policy of disarmament.-S-
The Prime Minister agreed that the parliamentary under-Secretary of State for Air should take some suchline as the Secretary of State had suggested, but thought that, in addition, there should be an amendment.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs suggested that an amendment should be moved as follows:-To leave out everything after &quot;imperial communications&quot;*mo add:  &quot;and declares its full supportof the policy o^ His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin working for the objects in respect ofair policy which are declared in theBritish Draft Convention&quot;.He pointed out that this would, give satisfaction tothose who considered the provision for Air Defenceinadequate, but would also meet the position of theForeign Secretary.The President of the Board of Education suggestedthat, some Private Member might move an amendment tothe effect that if the Disarmament Conference broke down, the Government would rectify the position.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs ratherdemurred to any suggestion being made that the Disarma-ment Conference might break down.The Secretary of State for India \irged that ifthe amendment was to be carried someone would have tomake a very sympathetic speech to the movers of theResolution.    It would have to be made clear in weightylanguage that the Government had every sympathy withthe Motion, coupled with an appeal to them not to embarrass the Disarmament negotiations, which are ina critical situation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested thatthe Lord President of the Council should be asked tomake a speech as suggested by the Secretary of Statefor India, and this suggestion was generally welcomed.-4-
The Lord President of the Council suggested some such line as the following:    If we had no hope of achieving any limitation of armaments we should, have every right to feel disquietude as to the situationnot only so far as concerns the Air Force, but alsothe Navy and Army.   Let us, however, examine whatwould be the effect of a Resolution of this kind.Here, in the House of Commons, everyone knew the rigid,meaning to attach to it.   Abroad, however, it wouldbe taken as a decision by the Government to re-arm.If the heavily-armed Powers would agree to disarm downto Germany&apos;s level, then cadit quaestio;    or if we obtained that parity in the air arm which had alwaysbeen the policy of the Government, again cadit quaestioAt present, however, we were using every possibleeffort to bring about a scheme of disarmament whichwould include Germany   a country that was in asensitive condition.    If Germany saw us passing some such Resolution as this, the effect on her would be serious .The Secretary of State for India urged that nothing should be done to fetter the hands of the Government,either one way or the other, as regards an increasein the number of squadrons .The Lord President of the Council said that hewould add that between now and the introduction of theBudget the Government would be considering the positionof the three Services in all aspects.   What object,therefore, would there be in passing this Resolution?If the movers of the Resolution would accept an amend-ment to strengthen the Government&apos;s hands at theDisarmament Conference they would be very grateful.mhe Secretary of State for Air urged that the critics should be satisfied that the Government were working towards the completion of the programme
announced in 1923.The Prime Minister said that if any such announce-ment were made the Government would be constantlypressed for information as to what their programme was.The Secretary of State for Air then gave somefigures to show the large increases being ma.de in air forces abroad, of which, up.to now, we had taken no notice so far as our own preparations were con-cerned.The Prime Minister said that this raised thegeneral question of the provision to be made for theDefence Services, which had been postponed pending(l) the receipt of the Report of the Defence Require-ments Committee, and (2) the progress made at Geneva in the direction of disarmament.   He thought, therefore,that the line to be taken that afternoon was to get an amendment put down on the lines suggested by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs.   Next, thewhole case should be stated, including the efforts ofthe Government to promote a Disarmament Convention.It should be made clear to the House of Commons thatthe Government realised that this country could not stand alone in its present position, and that on this understanding they accepted the first part of theResolution calling attention to the inadequacy of thepresent provision made for Air Defence.Some discussion then took place as to the point at which the Lord President should take part in the debate.The Secretary of State for Air warned the Cabinetthat there was a very strong feeling among the supporters of the Resolution.The Cabinet agreed  (a)- That steps should be taken to securethat a suitable Private Member should move an amendment on the following lines:-
&quot;To leave out everything after&apos; Imperial eommunieations T&apos;:To add:  &quot;and declares its full support of the policy of his majesty&apos;s  j es ty&apos;s G overnment in working for the objects in respect ofair policy which are declaredin the British Draft Convention&apos;&quot;.(b) That the Lord President of the council should speak early in the Debate;    if no amendment were moved, after theseconder of the Motion;    if an amendment were moved, as soon as the speaker rose to put it:(c) That the Lord President&apos;s speech shouldbe on the general line indicated, by theCabinet discussion and summarised above,and more particularly in accordance withthe suggestions of the Prime Ministerand himself.(NOTE:   The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs left&quot; the Cabinet Room to speak to the Parliamentary Secretaryto the Treasury on this subject witha view to the appropriate arrangements being made for the Debate.)
ICOMMERGIALKEXjOTTATIONSSlVITH FOREIGNCOUNTRIES .french  Dis-Icriminatoryipeasures .fspeeial Duties onprenchiGoods .[(previous Reference:Cabinet 64(33), Con-clusion 6.)3.    in accordance with their decision of November2nd (Cabinet 59 (33), Conclusion 10), the cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade (CP,-277 (33)) asking the approvalof his colleagues to a draft Order he proposed tomake under Section 12 of the Import Duties Act,imposing special duties of 20$ ad valorem, or their equivalent, on French goods if the French government do not remove their discriminatory measures against british goods .    He suggested that the Order should come into force on December 8th, immediately afterthe expiry of the notice to withdraw from the TariffTruce,The Prime. Minister raised the question as towhether in view of the friendly attitude of thenew French Government, it would not be as well to give them a little longer time than December 5thbefore announcing the Order.It was urged, however,  that after all that had happened there would be a considerable risk in   -   -postponing the date.      Ample notice had already beengiven to the French Government, and that very morning the President of the Board of Trade had received a telephone message from Paris indicating thepossibility that the French Government might give way.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked whether there was not some risk that the manufactured goodsincluded in the Order might not be sent to othercountries, such as Switzerland or Belgium, for somefinal finishing operation or embellishment and thuselude the Order.
said the Order had &quot;been most carefully considered from every aspect, hut undertook to examine theChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s suggestion.Subject to the above the Cabinet agreed -To approve the proposals of the Presidentof the Board^ of Trade as set forth inCo P. 277 (33) and summarised above.
?L/&apos;tions WITH 4.      The Secretary of State for Dominion AffairsHB*IRISH FREErp^rjvg. informed the Cabinet that he had hoped to have beenin a position to circulate the draft of a questionreviouseference: and answer in Parliament on the matters he had cabinet 64 (33)Conclusion 12).      raised at the meeting referred to in the margin.He had then learned that the Cabinet of the IrishFree State was to meet on the previous evening andhe had been led to expect a communication fromMr.  de Valera that very morning.      The communicationhad not arrived, and, on enquiry, he had been told that he would not receive it until later in the day.In the circumstances, he proposed as soon as Mr.  de valera&apos;s communication was received to summon theIrish Situation Committee.The Prime Minister pointed out that matters of grave import might be raised in Mr.  de Valera&apos;communication.      He thought, therefore, that theCabinet ought to be prepared to meet before nextTuesday when the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs had to ansfrer the questions put to him in the Houseof Commons and when a debate on Irish affairs was totake place in the House of Lords.The Cabinet agreed -That Monday morning next, December 4th,should be kept free by members of theCabinet in case it v/as necessary to holda meeting.
OVERNMENT 5.      The Prime Minister said, it was already tooSpqlioy.late to discuss the question under this heading.1iprevious He was anxious that he and his colleagues should reference:Voinet 64 (33)     reach some general understanding on the questionsConclusion 5).F.R.raised, particularly in view of the speeches thatwould have to he made in the country during thecoming winter.       He, himself, wanted guidance on these matters.      He instructed the Secretaryto continue Item 6 on the Agenda Paper and heannounced his intention to place      it on the liston some early occasion.
OIL IN THE 6.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byUNITEDKINGDOM. . the President of the Board of Trade (CP.-279 (33))on the question of Mineral Rights in Petroleum in(previous reference: Great Britain,  in which, after outlining theCabinet 13(33), Con- difficulties of the problem, he suggested thatelusion 4.)legislation should, be introduced at the earliestfrR.X^^H possible moment to the following effect:-(i) That the ownership of all petroleumwhich may exist in this country shouldbe vested in the State and that no compensation should be paid to owners of land, in respect of oil itself:(ii) ^he existing rights of owners of the surface to be recompensed for disturb-ance to property and loss of amenityshould not be interfered with:(iii) That the three small areas covered by existing licences granted under the1918 Act should either be excluded or compensation paid:(iv) That persons who secure a licence or lease from the Government to searchand bore for oil shall make their own arrangements with owners of land forthe necessary facilities:(v) That where such facilities cannot beobtained by agreement, provisions should be made on lines similar tothose contained in the Mines  (WorkingFacilities) Acts for securing thegrant of the necessa7--y facilities on terms to be determined by theCourts:(vi) That an early announcement of theGovernment&apos;s policy should be madewith an intimation that pending thepassage of the necessary legislationno further licences will be granted under the Petroleum (Prodtiction) Act,1918.Attached to the Memorandum was an annex showingthe present legislative position.
The Chancellor of the Exhcequer agreed in theconclusions of the President of the Board of Trade, hutpointed out that it would perhaps &quot;be easier to exclude the areas covered by existing licences than to pay compensation.     He also raised the question as towhether a royalty should not be exacted for the benefitof the State from those who worked oil in this country.The Cabinet were informed that the Duke of devonshire, whose property was actually producing oilthough not on a commercial scale, did not want to beexpropriated.The President of the Board of Trade said that atthe appropriate moment it would probably be advisable to have a consultation in such cases.The Secretary of State for Air raised the question as to how far the Cabinet were in agreement on theprinciple that the ownership of petroleum should be vested in the State,The discussion on this subject revealed aconsiderable measure of support to the suggestions ofthe President of the Board of Trade though no decision was taken on the question of principle.The Secretary of State for War while not himself criticising the proposals before the Cabinet,warned his colleagues that legislation was involvedwhich might encounter opposition in the House of Lords.(The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsreturned to the Cabinet during this discussion).The Prime Minister thought that all were agreedthat if a policy was to be settled it should be announced as early as possible.
in the proposed Bill, the Cabinet agreed -(a)      That the President of the Board of trade should be authorised to prepare a Billon the lines proposed in his memorandum and summarised above subject to the following:(l) The omission of the words &quot;or compensation paid&quot; in (iii).(3) Subject to agreement between thePresident of the Board of Trade andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer,provision for a royalty for the benefitof the State to be exacted frompersons working oil in this country.(b) That the Bill should be submitted to theCabinet for consideration before it was referred to the Committee of Home Affairs.(c) That the Bill should be kept as a Cabinetsecret and should not be shown to anyoneoutside the Government at the present stage.
THE PRODUCE: MARKETSSITUA^&apos; ION.(previous reference:Cabinet 32(33), Con-elusion 5.)0,337.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (CP.-278(33)) on the subject of the Produce Markets Situation.in which he indicated some of the salient questionsdemanding early attention.    As these questions involved matters of inter-Imperial and general trade policy requiring close and detailed consider-ation, the Minister suggested that it might be convenient if they could be examined by a Cabinet.Committee.The Cabinet agreed -That a Cabinet Committee composed asfollows  :Lord President of the Council,(In the Chair)Chancellor of the Exchequer,jThe Home Secretary,*The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs *The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The Secretary of State for Scotland,President of the Board of Trade,Minister of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries,President of the Board of Education,First Commissioner of Works,should be appointed to considerthe questions raised in CP. 278 (33)and reporttoithe Cabinet.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsaccepted on the understanding that he could berepresented by the Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State or an official of the Foreign Officewhen he so desired.

The Cabinet had under consideration theEducation and Employment of Young Persons Bill,to be introduced in the House of Commons by aPrivate Member on Friday, December 1st.The Prime Minister said that as this wasthe first occasion on which Private Members&apos; bills had come before trie Cabinet for some time, he wouldonce more urge his colleagues to remember thegeneral rule that they should exercise the utmostdiscretion in encouraging Private Members&apos;  Bills,ii bad Bill might be opposed, but in the case of a useful Bill they should not go further thanpromising to adopt a benevolent attitude if theBill was passed its second reading.        In thecase of the Bill under consideration, thePresident of the Board of Education was askedto arrange that the attitude of the government spokesman should be one of general neutrality.He should not actually oppose the Bill, but shouldpoint out the objections from an administrativepoint of view and should make clear that theGovernment could not accept any responsibility.It was generally recognised that there would be advantages if the Bill could be talked out-.

APPENDIX.SUMMARY OP STATEMENT BY SIR FREDERICK LEITH-ROSS.Sir Frederick Leith-Ross thanked the Prime Ministerfor his remarks.He gave a short summary of the war debt negotiations,emphasising the friendly attitude taken throughout byMr. Acheson, the then Under-Secretary of the Treasury.No permanent settlement had proved possible.      The U.S,Treasury were against the Warburg Plan, and the Presidentv/as&apos;against their alternative, which would have involvedscaling down the capital debt;    while both the president and the Treasury were against the most-favoured-nation clause in the form in which he had been instructed toput it forward.      On the other hand, the President hadin the end agreed without much difficulty to a further&apos;token&apos; payment and had not made serious objections tothe figure of 7i million dollars.As regards future prospects, the President had spokenhopefully of getting authority from Congress to settledebts before next June, but it seemed very improbable that he would succeed.      Sir Frederick thought that we might have to continue token payments next June, perhapsnext December and possibly even longer until U.S,  opiniongot accustomed to payments on this scale.      He did notthink we should embark on negotiations for a permanent settlement until the President had powers to settle..Several American Ministers had impressed on him thenecessity of combining negotiations on war debts withother subjects, especially tariffs, but it seemed tohim that this would be doubtful tactics from our point of view.
As regards the general situation in America, his mainimpression was one of confusion and scepticism.     TheGovernment there had no organised administrative machine and the Members of the Administration had not the samepolitical responsibility as Cabinet Ministers in othercountries.        They openly expressed doubts and criticisms of the President&apos;s policy.The Administration was actively pursuing experiments inmany fields without any adequate co-ordination.     The Govern-ment would have to put in about 2-g- -miiiirea dollars to keepthe banking system from collapse and this might lead themto complete Government control of banking.     As regardscurrency, the President seemed to have no s ettled convictionand he adopted the policy of depreciation as the quickestmethod of raising internal prices.     There was a great dealof misapprehension about our Equalisation Fund and theAdministration frequently claimed that they were only doing what we had done.      The Conservatives were able to preventinflation hut were not able to prevent an artificial andunnatural depreciation of the exchange.     Public opinionseemed to be confused and rather alarmed, and the oppositionto the Government policy was becoming organised and vocal.Meanwhile, there was a great deal of talk that the president had promised to buy up domestic silver at an artificial price,but no confirmation of this could be obtained from officialquarters.      Industry had been badly affected by the SecuritiesAct, which had practically stopped new issues.     The N.R.A.was provoking widespread opposition and the scheme had been modified so as to exclude small employers.      There was therisk that it might discourage enterprise by increasing costs and at the same time limiting prices, but the big industries would probably be able to look after themselves.       The
Agricultural Adjustment scheme might give rise to greater difficulties.     There seemed little prospect of any restriction of production and there was an increasing demand that the Government should fix prices of agriculturalJcommodities.     They might well he forced to buy the wheat and cotton crop at fancy figures and dump the surplus abroad.A very large expenditure was now being incurred by the federal government on relief, and despite efforts to improvise a proper administration, there was much laxity in its distribution,At Washington it was felt that the U.S. would in the end haveto have an insurance scheme.     Public Works had been adisillusionment.   Although 3.3 billion dollars had been allocated for this purpose, only 75 million dollars had actually been spent by October and that mainly on roads.     TheAdministration was now concentrating on pure relief works andon housing.The public was still attached to the President as a man,though critical of many of his measures.     Government assistance was regarded as the only way out of their difficulties.      Thusthere was a tendency to State socialism of the most inefficientand extravagant kind,  involving state assistance to bankingsindustry and agriculture.      There might be a reaction later onwhen the public realised the enormous cost involved but therewas no sign of it at present.     Much would depend on whetherthe president succeeded in raising internal prices.      Thebest opinion seemed to doubt whether this was possible withthe deflationary forces still at work, unless inflationwere carried to an extent that would make it uncontrollable.Meanwhile, the different schemes were creating a heavy strain on Government credit and the Treasury authorities wereapprehensive that the market in Government bonds might collapse.This was the immediate danger point.     The Government would have
to find 2 billion dollars of new money before 1 january and 4 billions during the present financial year, besideshaving large amounts to refund in December and next April.It was expected that Congress would meet in a very different mood to that which prevailed last spring.     Thenthey were afraid of the situation and put the responsibility on the President:    now they would all come forward with different demands and there might well be a deadlock betweenPresident and Congress.     Both the advocates of inflation and of stabilisation would be active and the best coursewould probably be for the President to satisfy both bydevaluing the dollar and at the same time inflating.      Theofficial financial authorities seemed hopeful that he would do this but there was no very definite indication to go by.Sir Frederick emphasised that everything depended on thePresident.      He was an astute Politician and his personalityradiated confidence and charm, but he was ill-equipped on financial and economic questions.     He was a bad judge ofadvisers.and he tended more and more to treat criticism asdisloyalty.      He seemed to have no settled convictions and dealt with many important questions with a surprising levity.He had treated Sir Frederick with great consideration andseemed to be not unfriendly to us, but his principal and perhaps sole interest was internal politics.
