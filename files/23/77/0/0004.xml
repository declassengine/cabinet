cabinet business(previous reference:Cabinet 35(33), Con-clusion 6.)P.R.1. The Cabinet had before them a Note by the PrimeMinister (C,P.-231 (33)), who had been consideringsome subjects of urgent importance which should bediscussed by the Cabinet in connection with the generalpolicy of the Government.    He therefore proposed toarrange to bring them up during the autumn Meetingsof the Cabinet, and they would include the following:-1.   The general international outlook.2FX.When there is a Budget surplus andthe question of cuts, etc., will arise:are there any principles as to its disposal which should guide our policy?Can we make a statement of policy inthe King&apos;s Speech in November, regarding:(a) The &quot;residuum&quot; of unemployed:(b) Provision for discipline andtraining of the adolescents?mhe Prime Minister invited any of his colleagues who might have anything to add to the above listto forward it to him as soon as possible.The Minister of Labour reported that the Unemploy-Insurancement/and Assistance Bills wrould, he hoped, be ready for circulation by the end of the present week,   fieasked whether he should send them, to the Cabinet orto the Unemployment Insurance Policy Committee.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To take note that the Prime minister would be formulating his plans for cabinet business on the basis of the subjects mentioned above, togetherwith any additions that his colleaguesmight suggest:(b) That the Unemployment Insurance and assistance Bills should be circxilatedto the Cabinet for preliminary consideration before being referredKSfxCst      to tne Cabinet Committee for examina-tion in detail.
2. The Cabinet had before them the following documents by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs on the subject of Germany and the Disarms-ment Conference:-CP.-2S7 (33), circulating the relevantPapers in regard to Baron von Weurath&apos;personal attack upon the Secretary ofState and the formerTs complaint of theview that the latest demands put forward by Germany went far beyond what was previously the subject of discussion between them:    and asking whethera White Paper containing some of the telegrams^should.not be issued at once:CP.-238 (33), covering the following papers :-(l) The Official Report of the Pro-ceedings of the Bureau of theDisarmament Conference on October 14,1933:(2) The Text of the German Minister ofForeign Affairs&apos; telegram toMr Henderson of October 14, 1933:(3) The Text of the Reply sent byMr Henderson to Baron von Neurathon October 16, 1933.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said the main point on which he wanted the guidance ofthe Cabinet was as to our next step in the matterof disarmament.   In his broadcast talk on theprevious evening he had done his best to check theidea that was current that after the present Meetingthe Government would see their way clearly as to thecourse to be taken.   The subject was one which wouldrequire mature consideration, and on which he wasnot prepared at the present moment to advise.For the moment he asked the Cabinet to considerwhether it was desirable to issue a White Paper.The attention of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs was then drawn to a suggestion thatwas being circulated in a widely-read newspaper
to the effect that he had made an important omissionin not explaining &quot;why the four years probationaryperiod for Germany had been raised to eight&quot;.The Secretary of State explained that in hisbroadcast statement on the previous evening he hadbeen replacing a speaker to whom only five minuteshad been allotted, and it had not been possible tocompress into so short a speech an explanation of thecomplicated question of the two periods into whichthe draft Convention was to be divided.   Moreover,at Geneva he had hardly realised how seriously thematter was being misrepresented in this country.Unfortunately, the first reports of his speech on saturday, October 14th,at Geneva, transmitted by thePress, had been inadequate and had given a misleading impression of the two periods of four years.   Thefull reports which had been published a little later .had been overlooked by many people, owing to theirpreoccupation with, the German withdrawal from theDisarmament Conference and the League   of Nations,to say nothing of misconstructions that had beenspread by opponents of the Government in certainPress organs and by a partisan broadcast.    As soonas he had realised the position the Secretary ofState had taken steps to have the whole situationexplained to the British Press at the Foreign Office,and as the result of the meeting there the Pressrepresentatives had expressed themselves as completelyinformed.    Nevertheless, hostile propaganda had continued.The Cabinet were reminded of the course of events which had led up to the division of the Conventioninto two periods, which had been discussed at their meeting on the 30th September ^Cabinet 51 (S3), Con-clusion 2) .
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs quoteda whole series of extracts from the Despatchesreproduced in CP.-337 (33) to prove that the latestdemands put forward &quot;by Germany had in fact gone far beyond what had previously been the subject ofdiscussion between him and Baron von Neurath.      he explained, however, that it would not be in the publicinterest to publish some of these extracts, moreparticularly those giving accounts of conversations with the American representative, Mr. Norman Davis,(as this would have a bad effect in the United States)and with the French representatives, &quot;which containedprivate promises by M. Daladier of armament reductions in the second period which had not yet been published in France, and the publication of which,  in presentcircumstances, must embarrass M. Daladier&apos;s Government.He indicated, however, those Despatches which couldbe published, if desired by the Cabinet, consistingof conversations and messages which passed between british and German representatives.In this connection it was suggested that the datesand times of the relevant telegrams indicated that theGerman decision to withdraw from the DisarmamentConference had been taken before the delivery of the speech by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs at Geneva on Saturday, October 14th.      If this werethe case, it was suggested that the point should bemade clear in any White Paper that was issued, sincethe Germans had led the world to believe that theGerman decision had been taken as the result ofSir John Simon&apos;s speech and not, as was almost certainly the case, at a meeting of the German Cabineton the preceding day.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs explained, however, that before making his speech
he had had to inform representatives of certain&apos;&quot; 9 other countries of its tenor.      He thought it possible that the Italians might have notified theGermans and that the latter might use such a communi-cation to support their contention.The Cabinet were reminded that even thoughcertain Despatches could not be published, for thereasons given by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, the published record of the Meeting of the bureau on October 14th (CP.- 238 (33)) brought out clearly the support given t o the Secretary ofState by the representatives of the United States,France, Italy, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, etc, andthe general solidarity on the subject,      A proposalto publish these speeches met with support.The Cabinet were reminded, however, that thereport would be criticised on the ground that it didnot contain details of the disarmament contemplated.The Secret Annex to CP.- 228 (33)  containing theseparticulars had been drawn up as representing what we knew that France was then willing to accept, but unfortunately it could not now be published withoutextreme embarrassment to the French Government *On the other hand, it was felt that something mustbe done to counter the misrepresentations being madein a large part of the Press, and even by Mr,  LloydGeorge, whose articles were widely quoted in Germanyand on the Continent.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat after this discussion he thought that it wouldbe a mistake to issue a White Paper conveying theimpression of merely carrying on a personal dispute
between Baron von Neurath and himself,    ^his wouldnot satisfy public opinion and might aid the germans in their object of dividing nations that were nowunited.    In these.circumstances he thought it wouldbe unwise to publish the extracts from CP .-237 (33)which he had given to his colleagues.The Prime Minister agreed that a White Paper onthese lines would be inadvisable, as playing intothe hands of those who wanted to imbroil the Govern-ment in questions of detail, and would be regardedmerely as a controversy between Germany and ourselvesIt would be better to focus on larger issues .The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should at once prepare a draftof a White Paper, which should includethe following:-(i) The Official Report of the speechesmade at the 48th Meeting of theBureati of the Disarmament Oon-ference on Sa-turday, October 14th;(ii) Baron von Neurath&apos;s telegram ofOctober 14th addressed to thePresident of the Conference, andthe Presidents reply   probably in an Appendix:(iii) An introductory statement whichshould bring out very clearly thecourse of events leading up to theMeeting of the Bureau on October14th,  including   ;the presentation by the PrimeMinister of the British DraftConvention, the discussion thereofat the Conference, the adjournmentfor Conversations, and the re-assemblyof the Bureau, with all relevantdates.   This covering statement should constitute an objectivestatement of facts, and shouldnot be controversial in tone:fb) ^hat the draft White Paper should beconsidered by a Cabinet Committee,composed, as follows :-The Prime Minister,^he Lord President of the Council,^he Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for foreign affairs the Secretary of State for War:-6-
(c) That the above Cabinet Committeeshould have full authority to issue a White Paper on these lines, if they thought advisable, without further reference to the Cabinet.(NOTE;  It was arranged that a meetingof this Committee should be heldon Thursday, October 19th, at10. Downing Street, at 2-30 p.m. )
3.   After dealing with the question of the proposed white Paper (Conclusion 2 above) the Cabinet had a preliminary discussion on their future policy inview of the German withdrawal.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs statedthat on the re-assembly of the Conference on October26th the President (Mr Arthur Henderson) wouldprobably propose that, after preliminary discussion in the General Commission, the proposed modificationsshould he referred to a Drafting Committee of Juristsfor incorporation in the Draft Convention.   This,however, was not a procedure that could possiblyadvance matters in present circumstances.   Mr Hendersonhad also shown a disposition to pass on the re-drafting of the Convention to the United kingdom delegation, as the authors of the Convention,, but sir John Simon had intimated that in the presentsituation in Europe this could not help mattersforwardQThe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs warned the Cabinet that to proceed with the discussion ofthe Draft Convention, as advocated by the Presidentof the Conference and the French Government, wouldinvolve the Conference in innumerable difficulties and create disunity such as the Germans claimed to exist already.   The French attitude was likely toharden, and the Americans were likely to take lessinterest in the Conference in future.In the course of the discussion various suggestions were made, e.g.:-(1) That encouragement should be given to M.Daladier,and that he should even be strongly pressed, to acton the offer made by Herr Hitler in a broadcastspeech for discussions between the French and German
Governments.    This proposal was not consideredlikely to be acceptable to M. Daladier.(2) That Sir John Simon should visit Paris in orderto press this proposal on M. Daladier and to urgeon him some concession on &quot;sample&quot; weapons.(3) ^he German Government should be asked what theyreally wanted   but it was pointed out that theywould probably reply that they had already made this clear (See C.P.-S57 fgg).  pane 11f paras. 5,6 . and 7).(4) Resort to the Pour-Power Pact, or the locarno treaty procedure.During the discussion a suggestion was made thatthe withdrawal of Germany from the League of nations would render the Locarno Treaty null and void.mhe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat his expert legal advisers confirmed his viewthat this was not the case,   ^here might be a bettercase to be made that it would destroy the Four-PowerPact, but this was not certain.In reply to a suggestion- that the Locarno Treatyought to be denounced, the Cabinet were-informedthat this was not possible under the provisions ofthat ins trument.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be invited to prepare fortheir consideration a Memorandum in whichhe would examine the various courses opento us for dealing with the situation created by the withdrawal of the german delegation from the Disarmament Confer-ence, and to give some indication asto which course he preferred:(b) That the Cabinet should hold a special meeting to consider this Memorandum onMONDAY,  OCTOBER 23rd,  at 2 p.m.

THE DYESTUPES(IMPORT REGU-LATTON) ACT.(previous reference:Cabinet 48(33), Con-elusion 15.)5.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe President of the Board of Trade (CP.-235 (33))on the subject of the Dyes tuffs  (import Regulation)Act.    The Memorandum stated that, in accordance withthe procedure announced last year, first the ImportDuties Advisory Committee had conducted an inquiry into the whole question and had recommended (Cmd.4411)the continuation of the prohibition, accompanied by certain amendments relating mainly to procedure, asummary of which was attached as Annex I to theMemorandum.   Then the Report had been communicatedto the Committee of Imperial Defence, and the three service Departments had endorsed strongly, from thepoint of view of defence, the recommendation that thegeneral policy embodied in the Dyestuffs (importRegulation) Act should be continued.   The Memorandumfurther stated that the existing powers of the Boardof Trade relating to dyestuffs would expire onDecember 31st and that it would be necessary for legislation of some kind to be passed before thatdate.   A first draft of a possible Bill was attachedto the Memorandum as Annex II.    The questions submittedby the President of the Board of Trade for the decisionof the Cabinet were as follows:-(1) Whether the recommendations of theImport Duties Advisory Committeeshould be accepted?(2) If so, whether an endeavour shouldbe made to push through a new bill before Christmas, or whether the oldpowers should be continued temporarilyby means of the Expiring Laws Continu-ance Bill, and the new Bill taken as early as possible in the new Session?
The Cabinet agreed:-(a) To accept the recommendations of the ImportDuties Advisory Committee as set forth in CP. 235  (33).(b) That the old powers should he continuedtemporarily by means of the Expiring laws continuance Bill.(c) That the new Bill should be taken as early as possible in the next session.(d) That the Secretary to the Cabinet should inform the Parliamentary Secretary to theTreasury of these decisions.

The3Bill also contained alternative provisions to meetan eventual decision whether the Bill should or should not apply to Civil Servants,      The authors ofthe Memorandum, however, thought that there were strong arguments against applying the Bill to theCivil Service, and in this view the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer had concurred.The Cabinet agreed:-(a) That the Bill should not be applied to theCivil Service but only to the defence services.(b) That subject to (a)  the Bill attached to cp.  230 (33) should be approved.(c) That the Law Officers of the Crown should deal with the question in Parliament.(Note.
