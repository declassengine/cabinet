1, The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs gave the Cabinet an indication of the line he proposed to take on the question of the locarno treaty in the forthcoming Debate on Disarmamentin the House of Commons.   He proposed, to begin with a statement of the implications of the Treaty,emphasising that in no case could we be called upon for action without our own assent.   Three of thecases provided for in the Treaty depended on theCouncil of the League, who must be unanimous.   As aPermanent Member of the Council our vote was neces-sary for any decision that could involve us in anyway.    The fourth case, namely, the one of &quot;flagrantaggression&quot;, was a matter in which we ourselveswere the judge.   The Law Officers of the Crown had advised that there was no way of saying that theTreaty of Locarno had come to an end.    If one party were to leave the League it did not mean that thewhole Treaty came to an end.   He proposed, instating the matter, to make use of a formula that had been read to the Cabinet by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer at the previous Meeting (Appendix).He saw no particular difficulty in dealing with theParliamentary Opposition on this question.Mr Lansbury had voted in Parliament against the locarno Treaty, but Mr Arthur Henderson, in&quot;Labour&apos;s Foreign policy&apos;, treated the convention as a sheet anchor ef our policy.   The Secretary ofState proposed to ask which attitude the Oppositionsupported.     Ke then gave the Cabinet an accountof a conversation he had had with Sir austen chamberlain, wh^se views had accorded closely withhis own.
The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,in stating that the Treaty could not be denounced&quot;by us or by any other signatory, to emphasise thatathis referred only to/uni-lateral act.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs undertook to do this, and agreed that if all theparties to the Treaty wished it to be brought toan end this could, be done.    Ee added that he intended to inform the Italian Government, before he made his speech, of the line he proposed totake, as set forth above.mhe Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the general lines onwhich the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs proposed to dealwith the Treaty of Locarno in theforthcoming Debate, as summarised above:(b) To take note that the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs wouldmake a communication to the ItalianGovernment on the subject before he made his speech.
Eduction andCitation opIDraft Plan for&apos;a aociif ledpsarmamentinvention.I previous reference:gabinet 59 (33)fconclusion 3. )a.2. In accordance with the Conclusion mentioned,in the margin,  the Cabinet had before them a Noteby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(CP.  255 (33))  covering a draft for a modifiedDisarmament Convention, which had been drawn up inthe Foreign Office as an attempt to overcome certainformidable difficulties in the way of the conclusionof a Disarmament Convention and to meet Germany&apos;s objections without affecting deleteriously the safety of this country, France,  and other States.The Cabinet also had before them a Noteby the Secretary of State for Air (CP.  259 (33))covering a Memorandum by the Chief of the Air Staffasking for a modification of the Article in theabove draft plan dealing with the question of bombing.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs emphasised the urgency of a decision, as the Bureau ofthe Disarmament Conference was to meet on Thursday,November 9th.   Mr Henderson was then likely to press the Bureau to prepare something to submit to theGeneral Commission on December 3rd.   The aim of his memorandum was to present a proposal that was not opento the objections that Germany had had to the lastproposals.   With this in view, it provided for some measure of disarmament at once, but hot far a &quot;trial period&quot; .The Cabinet were informed that the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff, as well as the Chief ofthe Air Staff, had technical objections to the scheme.As the Cabinet did not feel that thesetechnical matters were suitable for their discussionthey passed onto the question of principle, as towhether it was desirable for us to take the lead once more with fresh proposals.
The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out that his idea was not to launch theseproposals at the Bureau without prior discussion.The French Government would first be approached asto whether they could consent, and,, if they did,an approach would be made to Italy, who was likelyto notify the German Government.   mhe argument infavour of some such course was that other-wiseMr Henderson was likely to press for amendments to the British Draft Convention, some of whichwere likely to prove embarrassing to us, dealing,as they would, wit .. such matters as extending the&quot;No resort to force&quot; provisions to the whole world:a definition of an &quot;aggressor&quot; (on which Sir WilliamMalkin had been negotiating with French Expertswith a view to an innocvious definition) ;   and penalties .The Prime Minister said that he would ratherlike to call a halt on the production by our delegation of proposals whenever there was a dead-lock or a pause.    If the proposal in C.P.-255 (33)were put forward now, he did not think it wouldhave a success,   Why should we not let the twonations that were mainly at loggerheads, namely,France and Germany, take the initiative, notwith-standing that one of them had left the Conference?Mr Henderson might be asked to face his realproblem, which was that of France and Germany,and to come not to us, but to France for asolution?   He did not object, however, to a consideration of C.P.-255.(33) by the CabinetCommittee,.   He thought, however, that it would bea mistake to make a proposal which in two or threeweeks&apos; time was almost certain to be rejected.
The Chancellor       the Exchequer pointed out thatthe scheme in C .P.-255 (S3) -was described as&quot;a disarmament compromise&quot;.   The German Governmentwould claim that by going out of the ConferenceGermany had obtained some advantage, and would be encouraged to repeat the process .    It was a. mistake to encourage Germany to think that by such methodsshe could, get what she wanted.   He suggested thatthe right course, if we were talking to the French,might be to say that we did not propose to do any-thing at the moment and that the initiative was with them.    If the French were then to ask what we thought they should say to the Germans, we might encourage them to invite a German proposition,and so put the initiative on to the Germans.   Kewould prefer, therefore, neither the old Conventionamended,nor a new compromise, but some third coursesuch as he had suggested.In the course of the discussion a suggestion was made that any publicity to proposals should bekept back until after the German elections.   Anotherproposal was that touch should be obtained withdraw Benes, the Rapporteur, who was likely to provehelpful.    Emphasis was also laid on the importanceof not giving Germany any excuse to re-arm withoutfurther parley .The Prime Minister agreed with this latter view and pointed out that it was almost impossible atthe present moment for the Cabinet to say whatought to be done.   He recalled that when he hadDraftgone to Geneva to present the British/Conventionhe had had to disregard the advice of the Cabinetby inserting figures,  in view of the situationwhich developed.   mhe same might happen now, butin the meanwhile nothing must be said which wasoutside the intention of the cabinet decisions.
It was all a question of handling.   We ought notto be rushed by the President of the Conference.The following points, however, seemed to be clear:-(l) We had to secure that Germany did not offer nothing and start to re-arm:(2) We must not come out with a new initiative unless ahd until we hadthe certainty that Prance would notrun away from it:(3) Whatever was put forward must havea good propaganda value.He thought that the Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State should go to Geneva and invite the Frenchand Italians, with Dr Benes, to talk over the whole situation and then report to the Cabinet, who coulddecide how far they could go.    In the meanwhile theCabinet Committee should examine the proposal inC.P.-255 (33).The Lord. Chancellor urged that if our object wasto bring France and Germany together, it was no useputting forward a new plan which would be.rejected by one or the other.   We ought to get into contact with both.   This could not be done until after theGerman elections.Towards the end of the discussion the question was raised as to whether the Cabinet had not ineffect agreed already that it was useless to formulate an amended Convention which merelyincorporated the modifications suggested at the bureau of the Disarmament Conference on October14th, since Germany had publicly repudiated these-proposals and was bound to reject them when theywere incorporated in a new draft Convention.   by reference to the Minutes of the previous Meeting(Cabinet 59 (33), Conclusion 3) it was established that the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs had made this point, but no formal decision hadbeen taken.-S-
The Prime Minister thought there was no doubtthat the Cabinet had been in   agreement with theview o.f the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,even if no decision had been registered^The Secretary of State for War suggested thatit might be better not to take a formal decisionon the subject when the situation changed from dayt o day .The Cabinet agreed.  That the Ministerial Committee on disarmament should meet on thefollowing day, &quot;uesday, November Vth,at 10 Downing Street, at 11 a.m..to hear from the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and the parliamentary under-Secretary of state the line which the President of the DisarmamentConference was likely to take at theMeeting of the Bureau, and to examinethe draft Plan attached to CP.-255 (33).
3. The Cabinet had before them a Revised Draftof the Unemployment Bill (CP .-257 (33)), whichhad been circulated in accordance with the Conclu-sion of the Cabinet mentioned in the margin.The Cabinet first considered the names to beplaced on the back of the Bill (See Conclusion (a). below) .(The Prime Minister withdrew atthis point to attend an Audienceof the King, and the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs withdrewshortly after.)The Chancellor of the exchequer then made astatement to the Cabinet on the various points inthe Dill which he thought would especially interesthis colleagues, namely:,-Clause... 5 Sub-section (2)(b) , which had theeffect of raising the maximum period of benefit to 52 weeks.Qlause 9.dealing with the dependant child,which, after full discussion, theCommittee had agreed to leave asin the earlier draft.Clause 15, Sub-section (2)(b), raisingjr***.IL. !L.t^LUt-iu^J- ^-u^t.&apos; the grants/in respect of attend-; &apos; ance at Training Courses from50 per cent, to 75 per cent, ofany amount which may be paid outof the monies provided by Parlia-ment in respect of the attendancesin question.Clause SO.

mTHE british broadcasting corporation.Comments onInternationallAf fairs .(previous Reference:! Cabinet 55I (33).  Con-: elusion 4.)5.  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs fC .P.-252(33)) drawing attention to the deplorable effect onrecentthe public mind of some/B,B.C. comments on inter-national affairs, and asking whether any step couldbe taken to protect the general interest againstthe danger which this kind of proceeding seemed to threaten.    After explaining the events leading upto his own broadcast talk on Disarmament on October17th, and suggesting the course that should be taken if the matters referred to became the topic of question or. debate.in Parliament, the Secretary ofState submitted that the subject should be tackledlater on, when it could be regarded as a problemof modern government, without reference to anyparticular administration or any particular contro-versy.The Cabinet took note of theabove Memorandum.*  *  *2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1November 6, 19 33.
THE LOCARNO TREATY.Draft formula suggested &quot;by the Chancellor of the exchequer at the meeting of the Cabinet held on 2nd. November, 1955.(Cabinet 59 (33), Conclusion 5.)(Adopted by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs at the meeting of the Cabinet held on 6th november 1933. (Cabinet 60 (33),    conclusion .))The legal position is that the withdrawal of any party to the Treaty from the Council of the League doesnot of itself involve the release of all parties fromtheir obligations under that Treaty.But, the withdrawal of Germany if indeed it wereto become effective in two years, would raise issues of so far reaching a character that it would be impossibleto make any public statement upon them without carefulconsideration in consultation with the other parties tothe Treaty.
