THE IRISHFREE STATE(previous reference:Cabinet 66(3?), Con-clusion 4.)The Cabinet held a Special Meeting to considerthe following Most Secret documents on the questionof relations with the Irish Free State:-A copy of a Despatch from Mr de Valera,dated November 29, 1933, together witha draft reply thereto prepared by theCabinet Committee on the Irish Sltua-tion (C.P,-281 (33)):A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs (C.P.-287 (33))suggesting amendments to paragraphs 4,5 and 6 of the draft reply.In the course of the discussion reference wasmade to the following Private Question, addressedto the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs andto be answered in Parliament on the follow-ing day:-&quot;If he will take immediate steps tobring to the notice of the natives of the Irish Free State, both in thiscountry and the Free State, the disad-vantages which they will suffer bothin status and. in the way of enteringthis country from the declaration ofthe Irish Free State as a republic&quot;,THE SECRETARY OP SmAmE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS saidthat in the ordinary way he would have felt someapology was needed for submitting a further draft reply to Mr de Valera when he had been a party tothe Cabinet CommitteeTs draft.   He recalled, however,that he had only received Mr de Valera&apos;s letter onthe morning that the Committee met;    he had had toprepare a draft reply for the Committee^ considera-tion;    and subsequent re-consideration had led himto modify the views he had accepted at the Committee.The decision was a very important one, not only fromthe point of view of the Government at home, but also from that of the loyalist Unionists and the 40 percent, in the electorate of the Irish Free State whoeven at the&apos; last election had. voted for the Treaty,It was especially important to the leaders of that40 per cent, who had remained loyal to the Treatyat the risk of their lives and, in spite of recent
opposition, were still defending it.    Finally, thedecision was important from the standpoint of theother Dominions.    He recalled that some years agoGeneral Hertzog had made a speech claiming the rightof secession and his intention of raising it at an imperial Conference,   He had raised it at theConference of 1930, and the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs had himself made clear that if SouthAfrica did try and leave the Empire no-one would prevent it.    That had. been the view of the cabinet of that day, and he still held it.   He was fortifiedin holding this view by the fact that on March 30,1920, Mr Bonar Law had stated as follows:-&quot;There is not a man in this House, andleast of all my right hon. Friend, whowould not admit that the connection ofthe Dominions with the Empire depends upon themselves . , If the self-governingDominions, Australia, Canada, chosetomorrow to say a We will no longermake a part of the British Empire&apos; wewould not try to force them.   dominion home-rule means the right to decidetheir own destinies&quot;.He mentioned these matters because in any Debatethese matters were bound to be brought up, and theyshowed the view that was generally held.   Whileeveryone, he thought, agreed that it was impossibleto use force to recapture Ireland, the only question at issue was whether it was wise to say so.    It was important to try and arrive at what was going on in mr de ValeraTs mind,    One view was that, he wassetting a trap and wanted to get us to state that wehad taken no decision on the subject, and then to lead the people of the Irish Free State to believe this meant we did intend to use force.   There was another view, that Ireland was suffering       soseverely from economic pressure that Mr de Valeramust do something.    He was faced with an internalstruggle and with the I.R.A,, and thought that if he
could get a deals ion on this point he might hold anmhe Secretary of State&apos;selection and jump the pitch.   /     own&apos; friends told him that,  given the Irish temperament, if the Irish people were told that we would use force in the event oftheir declaring a republic, it would be sufficientto make them all vote for a republic, but that in thecontrary event, if they saw that they were free to do what they liked, they would not vote that way.   Afterthese preliminary remarks he quoted, the following passage from the Irish Situation Committee&apos;s draft-reply&quot;In reply I have to state that HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom have taken no decision andfeel themselves under no obligationto take a decision upon the course which they would take if the IrishFree State were to repudiate Its treaty obligations in the manner suggested&quot;.In the House of Commons the question would immediately be asked &quot;What does that mean?&quot;    In the end theGovernment&apos;s real view   that we would not use force -would be dragged out of them.   Re had therefore cometo the opinion, after discussion with representativesof the Dominions and others, that we should make it plain what we did. mean, as suggested in CP.-287 (33).He then read the re-draft, contained in CP.-287 (33),of paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Cabinet Committee&apos;draft attached to CP.-281 (33).   He proposed to addat the end. of the Memorandum an entirely new paragraph,which he read to the Cabinet, the object of which wasto conclude on an appeal to Mr de Valera not to force the issue.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR felt sure theCabinet had no complaint that , if the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs had changed his view,he should tell them so.   He himself, however, feltsomewhat horrified lest the Cabinet should adopt theview he had just set forth, namely,  that we should
announce that we should never resort, to force, andthen make an appeal rto Mr de Valera.    In his viewMr de ValeraTs letter involved no subtlety.   He meretytook the line which he had taken in his interviews with   the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs and himself a year or twoago, namely, that his policy was a united irish republic and that by no other means could good relations be established between the two countries.He recalled that on November 14th the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs had made a speech which mr de Valera had. interpreted, to mean that the IrishFree State was entitled, to become a republic.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRSintervened to say that he had said nothing of thekind.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR agreed,  and saidthat that was the way Mr de Valera had interpretedthe speech.   Mr de Valera had then said, in effect,that if that were the case he had. no doubt about theverdict of his country.    He had followed that up with his letter of November 29th in C.P.-281 (53).Was it not; plain that he hoped to get an answer to his question as to whether the British Government &quot;had decided not to treat as a cause of war or otheraggressive action a decision of the Irish people tosever their connection with the Commonwealth?&quot;    Ifwe replied in the affirmative he would embroil us with the Dominions:    if we replied in the negativehe would have an election and win it with a majorityfor a republic.   He understood the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs to say that  if we did not answer the question Mr de Valera would say &quot;As they do notanswer it is clear they mean to use force&quot;.   In his view one reason why the Irish had not already dared-4-
to repudiate the Treaty was that they did not knowwhether they would, be up against force or not.    Ifthere was any. risk of force they would not run it:if there was no risk they would, act.    It was truethat inside the Cabinet they were under no delusionsas to what the position would be in the event of se-exceptionaloession, but the^e might be/cases in which we shouldhave to use force.    Supposing, for example, secessionwere accompanied by a civil war and resistance inthe Irish Free State, was it certain we should give no assistance?TKF S^CRE^AHY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs suggested that the words he had proposed would not prevent that,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR asked whether, ina case where the proclamation of a republic led todisorder and perhaps civil war in Ulster, a war whichmight easily spread over the border, wre might not be compelled, to use armed force?   He recalled that theWar Office had some small detachments of troops inIreland, the existence of which he himself deplored.If they were attacked, would we resist?    It was amatter on which the Navy might have something to say.If we did resist, however, we should be told that wewere using armed force. As regards the claims that other Dominions had the right to secede, he pointed out that this right was inherent in dominion status.    In the case of the Irish Free State, however,there was a definite Treaty, and. the Irish Free Statecould, only secede by breaking that ^treaty.    If Irelandwere allowed to secede it would, he thought, prevent any Conservative Member from supporting the IndianWhite Paper,   The Indian proposals contemplatedDominion status, with safeguards  against secession.
If we allowed the safeguards to be broken, by theIrish Free State, how could anyone support *.corresponding arrangement with India?   He asked whythe Government should ever allow a statement to bedragged out of them that they would in no circumstances-stances use force?    He could conceive cases in which,without going to war, some kind of economic pressuremight be employed.    In view of all the above consid-considerations he appealed to the Cabinet to support theCommit tee&apos;s draft so far as regards Paragraph 4 was concerned, tho\:gh he said he had an amendment tosuggest to another part of the draft.THE LORD CHANCELLOR, referring to the Constitu-tional position, pointed out that since 1926, andespecially since the passing of the Statute of westminster, we had to consider carefully ourrelations with the Dominions,- and what was the nexuswhich bound us to them.    He thought that theposition could no longer be described, as a Common-wealth of Nations, but only as a league of nations.If this was the case, some of the nations composingthe League had Treaties one with another.   We shouldsoon have to make up our minds as to the machineryby which the question was to be settled whendisputes arose about these Treaties.   At present he did not know what answer he could give if he were asked the question &quot;What will you do if someonebreaks a Treaty?&quot;THF SECRETARY OF S^at FOR INDIA suggested thatthe Irish Treaty occupied a distinctive position,since it had been a precedent to the application tothe Irish Free State of Dominion status.THE lord CHANCELLOR thought it did not matter very much what was the precise status of the Treaty.Some kind of tribunal was required, but he was anxious that we should, avoid having our hands forced
JI3in this matter at the present moment.THE PRIME MINISTER asked his colleagues to remember all that had been given away in 1926 and what had resulted from referring the details of the1926 settlement to a Committee composed entirely oflawyers .THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OF EDUCATION spoke asa member of the Cabinet who was not a member of theIrish Situation Committee.   The difficulty he felt as to the original draft, as well as the new draftproposed by the Secretary o^ state for DominionAffairs was that it laid so much emphasis on the word&quot;decision&quot; in Paragraph 4:    that is to say, on thefact that the Government had taken no decision.People would say this was rather odd;    the Governmenthad had plenty of time, why had they taken no decision?Moreover, whichever way a decision was taken, theposition woul^ be awkward.   Re agreed also that thiswould be the case in relation to India.   Consequentlyhe would take his stand on a refusal to answerhypothetical questions.   His suggestion, therefore,was as follows:-In Paragraph 4, line    6, of the draft replyattached to C.P.-281 (33), to state asfollows&quot;In reply I have to state that HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom feel themselves under no obligation to announce their decision in circumstances as yet onlyhypothetical concerning the conse-quences which would ensue if theIrish Free State were to treat itsTreaty obligations in the manner suggested&quot;,He thought also that it would be better to omit theportions of the draft dealing with the consequences to the Irish Free State and its citizens if they became a republic.   He had been told that at thelast election Mr Cosgravefs platform had been that-7-
320 :Iif elected he would bring about a settlement with theUnited Kingdom and. an. improvement in the economicsituation.   Mr de Valera, on the contrary, had said he could promise no economic satisfaction, but onlythe redemption 0* the soul of the Irish people.If that were the case, surely it would be better notto set out a mere catalogue of threats?THE SECRETARY OP STA^F FOR FOREIGN affairs suggested that Mr de Valera&apos;s object was to obtain a document useful for electioneering purposes.    Fromhis letter it was plain what was the answer he wouldlike.    He had put a gloss on the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs&apos; words which they would notbear, and had then asked for a definite decision tothat effect ,    The Cabinet roust at any rate feel sure that a plain affirmative decision would, in Mr de valera*s view, help his position.   He asked himselfwhy this was the case?    ^he answer was that it wouldenable Mr de Valera to say to the electors that thematter was now entirely in their own hands and thatthey oughf to seize the opportunity to achieve the aims of their ancestors .    A second consideration was as to how stich a decision would affect our own friends in Ireland?    These people had remained very staunch,notwithstanding that their own ancestry had taken thesame view as those of Mr de Valera&apos;s followers.   Havingsigned, the document they had nobly stood by it.    Theduty of the Government was to give these people thebest chance they could at the election.   He could not help feeling that to give Mr de Valera what he wantedwould not help Mr Cos grave&apos;s Party,   ^o sum up, we wanted Mr de Valera to lose the election.    mo give him the answer he had asked for would help him andwould not help our friends.
TFE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION affairs recalled that in the past the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs had taken the line that in dealingwith the Irish we should never concede to force what we could not concede to reason.THF SECRETARY OF S^A^E FOR AIR pointed out thatin the past, whenever Ireland had been governed welland had been content, it was because force lay behind.All that had. happened in recent years was due to ourtaking the opposite view. Fe agreed with every wordof the Secretary of State for War, and with the line that the President of the Board of Education proposed.TFE PRIMP MINISTER said he would now like to hear the views of some members of the Irish situation committee,t*PE HOME SECRETARY said he was concerned &quot;epart-mentally with the position of Northern Ireland.    IfNorthern Ireland were attacked, force would have tobe used.    On re-conside^ation he had. come to the viewthat It would be wiser not to insert details as toIrish citizens becoming aliens, and so forth.   He didnot think this was helpful now, and if the eventoccurred it might be found, that the position was quite different from what we now postulated.    He supportedpro-the/position of the President of the Board of Educa-t ion,THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said thathe had been thinking the matter over during theweek-end, and had already come to a view very similarto that of the President of the Board of Education.THF CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER, also speakingas a member o^ the Committee, said that his firstinclination had been on the lines suggested by theSecretary of State  &quot;or Dominion Affairs.   As a member
of the Committee, however, he had accepted the draftnow before the Cabinet,    nhey were now ashed tore-consider that position.   On the whole he ratherinclined to the suggestion of the President of theBoard of Education.   He was pretty clear that weshould not prevent the establishment of an irish republic by force, but he was impressed by the factthat there might be accompanying circumstances thatwould, compel us to resort to force.   He thought thatif the view of the President of the Board of Educationwere accepted, the new paragraph at the end, whichhad been read by the Secretary of St3te for DominionAffairs, might be found, too long.   He thought,however, some paragraph should be inserted to end the Despatch on a friendly note, more particularly as Mr de Valera&apos;s own Despatch was in form a friendly document.
THE SECRETARY OP STATS DOR DOMINION aFRAIRSasked the Cabinet to realise that he felt very keenlyon this subjeot.      Referring to the Prime Minister&apos;remarks he thought that in 1926 the Empire had been destroyed.      Nevertheless, in 1930 he had had to put up a defence of the 1926 position.      Referring to theSecretary of State for Air&apos;s remarks, he agreed thatthe Irish had got into their heads that the moreaggressive they became, the more they would get their way.      In labour disputes he had always warned employersnot to concede to a strike what they would.not concedeto an argument.      The Government were in somewhat thesame position vis a1 vis Mr. de Valera&apos;s letter.      Hewas emphatic that he had never used words which couldbe construed to mean that in no consideration wouldwe use force, v.(There was general agreement that Mr. de valera had misinterpreted the Secretary of State&apos;swords in an unfair manner.)Continuing the Secretary of State said thatif we were not going to answer Mr.  de Valera&apos;s questionhe was willing to use any language that the Cabinetpreferred.     He was certain, however, that the answerwould be forced out of the Government in the House ofCommons,      The more the attempt was made to fence withthe question, the more their critics would press them tosay that they would.not use force.      The more it wassuggested that in certain circumstances force might haveto be used, the more effectively would the people of theIrish Free State rally together.        If a specificquestion v/ere asked in the House, it would be impossibleto go on fencing.       The answer would be dragged out.The answer to be given to the question at the head ofthese Conclusions on the morrow would have to show that
the Government were people who did not want to use force.      In reply to a question as to whether lord craigavon had been consulted, he replied in the negative.      Lord Craigavon was ill and great care hadto he exercised to keep his name out.      He would,however, he informed of the decision that was taken.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs agreed that it would he better to make a statementnow than to have it dragged out.      That raised a difficult question.      He feared, however, that anyassent to Mr. de Valera&apos;s view could not fail to benefitMr.  de Valera.THE PRIME MINISTER thought it clear that Mr,de Valera believed that by forcing the Government&apos;shands he would be assisted.      The Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs was quite rightly concerned over two points.      First, if a declaration was forcedout of him in Parliament, the Government would be ina difficult position.      The question at issue, however,was, &quot;Is it necessary that a declaration should be forced out?&quot;     The second difficulty was as to theeffect on Mr. Cosgrave1s party at an election if adeclaration were made as proposed.        One could imagineMr.  de Valera saying, &quot;I have cleared the road.    I have got a statement out of the British Government which enables you by/selection to declare a Republic.&quot;     Oneview taken at the Cabinet was that this helped Mr.  de valera.      The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs had taken rather a different view.      His own feelingwhen he read the Committee&apos;s draft v/as not one ofsatisfaction.      He felt the draft wanted furtherconsideration.      In fact, he did not like either of the drafts and thought the situation could be better handled.
He would, therefore, he glad if the question could he considered again in the light of the Cabinet&apos;discussion, and he would like the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs to consider the proposal of thePresident of the Board of Education.    . The latter&apos;position was fundamentally his own.      It was not merely aquestion of war or no war.      What authority had theGovernment to make this declaration?     We were not anindependent power in this matter.       He knew enough of the Dominions to be certain that if a declaration was made a telegram might arrive from Australia ordecisionSouth Africa saying that they disagreed in our Irish/as partners in the constitutional machinery of theEmpire,      They might ask for an Imperial Conference.That was a very real possibility.THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL said that he also as Chairman of the meeting on Friday had ratherchanged his mind and was attracted by the proposal ofthe President of the Board of Education.      Secessiondid not raise a clearcut issue.      It might bo accompaniedby a seizure of the ports where we had a special position under the Treaty, or by an invasion of Ulster,or by the outbreak of a civil war in Ulster which wouldspread across the border.      If references were made tothose possibilities in a public speech it would belike dropping a match in a magasine.        On the whole,he agreed virith the Home Secretary that it would be better to drop the paragraphs referring to the position of irish Free State citizens in the event of a Republicbeing proclaimed.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER criticisedthe wording of the President of the Board of Education&apos;proposal -(&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government feel themselves under no obligation to announce their decision&quot;)
on the grounds that the words underlined would convey the idea that the Government had reached a decision.This   would increase the difficulties of the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs.      In order to avoid this he suggested the following draft -&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom must decline to contemplate therepudiation by the Irish Free State of itsTreaty obligations in the manner suggested,and consequently they do not feel calledupon to say what they would do in thecircumstances which are purely hypothetical.&quot;THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA thoughtthat the Government could stand by those words in debate.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATIONagreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s draft was preferable,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs pointed out that the new draft gave no answer to Mr.  de valera&apos;s question.      He did not think it possible tofence indefinitely with questions for a clearerdefinition.THE SECRETARY OF STATS FOR INDIA made a strongappeal for the omission of the clauses relating to theposition of Irish Free State citizens in the event of are public being proclaimed.THE SECRETARY OF STj^TE FOR WAR pointed out thatMr.  de Valera had only asked one question which couldbeanswered on the lines proposed by the Chancellor of theExchequer and the President of the Board of Education.Consequently, it v/as unnecessary to insert the othermatters.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs pointed out that on the morrow he had to answer/er aquestion in the House of Commons reproduced a t the headof the Conclusions.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIESsuggested that a unilateral declaration by this country
on the grounds that the words underlined would convey the idea that the Government had reached a decision.This   would increase the difficulties of the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs.      In order to avoid this he suggested the following draft -&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom must decline to contemplate therepudiation hy the Irish Free State of itsTreaty obligations in the manner suggested,and consequently they do not feel calledupon to say what they would do in thecircumstances which are purely hypothetical.&quot;THE SECRETARY OE STATE FOR INDIA thoughtthat the Government could stand by those words in debate.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OE EDUCATIONagreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s draft was preferable.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs pointed out that the new draft gave no answer to Mr. de valera&apos;s question.      He did not think it possible tofence indefinitely with questions for a clearerdefinition,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA made a strongappeal for the omission of the clauses relating to theposition of Irish Free State citizens in the event of are public being proclaimed,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR pointed out thatMr, de Valera had only asked one question which couldbeanswered on the lines proposed by the Chancellor of theExchequer and the President of the Board of Education.Consequently, it v/as unnesessary to insert the othermatters.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs pointed out that on the morrow he had to answer/er aquestion in the House of Commons reproduced a t the headof the Conclusions.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIESsuggested that a unilateral declaration by this country
v/as contrary to the constitution of the Empire.THE SECRETARY OF STaTE FOR DOMINION affairs pointed out that so far we had treated it purely fromthe point of view of the Irish Treaty. He v/as told that the Empire v/as only affected if we declared that tiIrish Free State was outside the Empire and not if ititselfdeclared/a Republic.THE   ATTORNEY-GENERaL said that the positionof citizenship within the Empire v/as very tangled.We had our own United Kingdom Act declaring theposition of our own citizens, and some of the dominions had also their own statute law.      It would be disastrous to got into the position of our havingdeclared that citizens of the Irish Free State werealiens while some other parts of the Empire, e,g,  SouthAfrica, might declare that they were not.        He would find it very difficult to commit himself to a statementof what was the position of the Irish Free Statecitizens, whether here or in the Dominions if they became a Republic.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIESpointed out that clearly considerations much v/iderthan those affecting the United Kingdom were involved.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA thought thatin tnese circumstances it would be very dangerousfor the Government to tie their hands by a declaration.THE SECRETARY OF STaTE FOR DOMINION affairs thought it would be also quite a wrong line for thereason that the whole issue so far had turned on theIrish Treaty.        The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs strongly deprecated any idea of consulting theDominions.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed, but suggested-15-
Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.,4th December, 1933.that the day after a statement had &quot;been made weshould be told by the Dominions that we had no rightto make it.      Whether they were right or not we cannot afford to enter upon that controversy.THE SECRETARY OE STATE FOR WAR suggested that sir Alfred Knox&apos;s question should be separated from Mr.  de valera&apos;s question and that this was all the moreimportant if the short answer was to be given to Mr. de valera.      He thought that it would be possible to framea short answer to Sir Alfred Knox&apos;s question which had norelation to Mr.  de Valera&apos;s question.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION ^FFIARSthought the cost plan would be to summon the irish situation Committee the same day and to hold a meetingof the Cabinet late that evening or on the following day to consider their recommendations.After some further discussion, the cabinet agreed -(a) That the Irish Situation Committee should meet the same evening at 9.30 p.m.  in thePrime Minister&apos;s room at the House of commons to reexamine the situation in the light ofthe Cabinet&apos;s discussion.(b) That the Prime Minister himself should attend the meeting of the Committee.(c) That the Committee should be given full authority to decide the question at issueon behalf of the Cabinet,
