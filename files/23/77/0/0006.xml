THE Committee had before them a Note by the secretary covering lists of Bills proposed for the Parliamentary Session1933-34 (Paper HA. 21 (33) ).The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury informed theCommittee in connection with the Bills now before parliament that it was hoped to pass the Local Government Bill before the close of the present Session.2. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury informed the Committee that it appeared to him on the information available that, in addition to the usual Compulsory or AnnualBills, time would have to be found in the new Session for Bills of major importance dealing with the following subjects : Unemployment Insurance and Assistance.Poor Law Reform (Scotland).Betting and Lotteries.Sugar Subsidy.Newfoundland Constitution.Dyestuffs.Hy drogenation.Overseas Trade Acts Amendment.Palestine Loan.Housing (Moyne Report).Some of these Bills, notably the Unemployment insurance and Assistance Bill, would make large demands on parliamentary time. It was unusual for a Session to pass without emergency legislation being required. There would accordingly be very little time available for Bills other than those to which he had referred,and he hoped that Ministers concerned would, so far aspracticable, refrain from introducing Bills which would have little or no prospect of passing into law, and the preparation ofwhich imposed additional heavy burdens on parliamentary counsel.The passage of Bills by certain dates, e.g., the passage of the newfoundland Constitution Bill by the 31st December, 1933.must be dependent on the progress made with the UnemploymentInsurance and Assistance Bill.The Committee agreed (a) To adopt the following classification in submitting to theCabinet their recommendations regarding the relativeurgency of the Bills enumerated in Paper HA. 21 (33)on the understanding that it will be for the Cabinetto determine the order of priority and relative importance of the Bills :- -(A) Bills already before Parliament.(B) Usual Annual or Compulsory Bills.
