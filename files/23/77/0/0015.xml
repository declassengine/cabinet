REDUCTION and limitation of armaments.(previous reference:Cabinet 63(33), Con-conclusion ion 1.)1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported to the Cabinet that on the occasion of his recent visit to Geneva he had carried out theConclusions reached at the Meeting referred to inthe margin, subject to one variation.   The cabinet had indicated their view that he should take theearliest available opportunity after his arrival atGeneva to clear up the misunderstanding stillexisting, both at home and abroad, particularly inGermany, as to the relation between the British draft Convention and the proposals of the 14thOctober last.   This public statement he had not made,for the reason that after arrival at Geneva he foundthat no-one there was under any misapprehension on. the subject.    Moreover, Mr Arthur Henderson, thePresident of the Conference, had made the pointperfectly clear in his own statement.    Even theFrench, who still wanted to adhere to the suggestions of October 14th, were clearly under no misapprehen-sion.    He also saw that the misunderstandingsexisting in this country were    disappearing.He had, however, a special reason for avoiding thestatement, - that it would have caused strainedrelations with the French Government, which was aweak one and likely to fall.    So far as Germany was concerned, a statement at Geneva would not reach the German people unless Herr Hitler so desired,as he had control over all publicity.   Moreover,he had already notified the German Government, whoquite understood the position..Oh the main point, the Secretary of State saidthat at one time a severe breach had threatenedbetween the French and Italian Delegations, but heand the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State had succeeded in averting it.   The information from
Geneva showed that.a difference of opinion had occurred over a minor point, but he could assure the Cabinet that there would be a general agreement as the outcome of the present meetings, resulting in a suspension of the Disarmament Conference until after the January meeting of the Council of theLeague, and in the interval there would be paralleland connected, diplomatic discussions between thePowers principally concerned,^he Secretary of State further informed theCabinet that Mr Arthur Henderson was not likely to resign the Presidency of the Conference, though hehad intimated that if all the conversations betweenthe different Powers were put in his hands andunder his direction he thought he could ensure a successful result.   When the Secretary of State had spoken to him of the difficulty of stopping communi-cation through the recognised channels, and of theobjections the Italians would have to any suchsuspension, Mr Henderson had replied that he wouldwash his hands of the conversations.   eventually the Secretary of State had written a letter toMr Henderson intimating that the United KingdomGovernment would hope to have all the assistance that he could give, and Mr Henderson had repliedwelcoming this suggestion, but adding that other nations might think differently, and on the whole he was inclined to stand out of the conversations.Mr Henderson was likely to make a statementtoday that would not be other than helpful.   A.solution of the disarmament difficulties had notbeen found, but he thought that a method ofprocedure had been adopted which had put thequestion on the rails again and in a good atmosphere.
.   The secretary of State then ashed that the ministerial Committee on Disarmament might meet toconsider what our attitude was going to be, and what we were to do during the adjournment of the Confer-once.   Among the specific points for consideration which he mentioned were  (i) ^he French request for either aninterchange of information or an examination by us of their informa-tion on the subject of German re-armament.   He had had to promiseM. Paul-Boncour that he shouldreceive an answer very shortly.(ii) The best way to deal with Herr Hitler&apos;recent proposal that the army shouldbe increased to 300,000 men, etc.(iii) The course to be followed in the conversations parallel to the workof the Disarmament Conference.In the meantime, the Secretary of State added, hewas keeping in touch with other nations and encouraging Franco-German conversations.The Prime Minister expressed satisfaction atthe result of the visit by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to Geneva, in which other membersof the Cabinet associated themselves.    It was particularly gratifying to learn that the misunder-standings as to the relationship between thestatement of October 14th and the British DraftConvention had been cleared up.   He was glad that the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs had found it unnecessary to make a speech on thesubject. &apos;&apos;&apos;In reply to various questions the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs said that TechnicalCommittees were at work at Geneva to consider thequestions of Effectives and Supervision,   He thought they \vere doing harm and not good, and to hissurprise Mr Henderson had expressed the same view.
The French wanted to go on with these-Committees,and the Italians had refused.    The best course was probably to shut them down.   Today the position was likely to be left to the President of the Conference,in consultation with the officials of the Bureau.If the worst came to the worst we could withholdrepresentat ion.In reply to a series of questions addressed tohim by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, theSecretary of State said that the usefulness of theso-called &quot;offer&quot; by the German Government to advance proposals must not be exaggerated.    It was true that Baron von Neurath had promised to make atrustful and honest offer, and certain suggestionshad been advanced in Rome and directly to theBritish Ambassador in Berlin for an alternativebasis for disarmament, including an establishmentof 300,000 men for the German Army, compared with800,000 in the British draft.    For a force of this size the Germans stated that they did nbt wantevery kind of weapon, but a proper outfit.   As theCabinet were aware, the German General von Blombergwas reported again to have mentioned the subject toSir Eric Phipps.    That was one of the points whichhe wished the Ministerial Committee to consider.So far as concerned recent indications ofItaly&apos;s attitude, the full gravity of these, he said,went deeper than disarmament.   The Germans and italians both wanted the frontiers of Europe to be altered, whereas France wanted to keep them, as atpresent, while our view, broadly speaking, was similar to that of France.   The significance ofrecent events was that first Germany had repudiatedthe League of Nations, and then S. Mussolini had followed by stating that Italy wanted a better
League, by which he meant that the Covenant was inadequate because it did not provide for an alteration of frontiers except bya unanimous vote.One point to which he attached importance, therefore,was that we should get into early contact withS. Mussolini, - and that was a point he would bring before^the Cabinet Committee.    In this connectionM. Paul-Boncour had told him that Prance would agreeto parallel conversations and that he did not exclude direct conversations between Prance andGermany.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the questions raised by theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be referred to the ministerial Committee on Disarma-ment, with a right to invite thepresence of other Ministers if they so desired:(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should circulate a short Note setting out the ques-tions which he wished to havedis cussed:(c) That a preliminary meeting shouldbe held on the morrow, Thursday,November 23rd, at 11 a.m., at10 Downing Street.-5-
AIR raids precautions.(previous reference:Cabinet 27(33), Con-conclusion ion 12.). p./?; -11(34)/.2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary (C.P.-271 (33)) on the subject ofAir Raids Precautions, in which he called attentionto the following question to be asked in the House ofCommons on November 23rd:-&quot;?o ask the Secretary of State forthe Home Department if he will giveparticulars of the action that isbeing taken to protect the civilpopulation of London in the event of aerial attack&quot;,This Question was symptomatic of a general feeling of public anxiety and. curiosity, and the HomeSecretary thought that the time had now come when itwould be in the public interest to make a statement,in general terms setting out the nature of theprotective measures which are being worked out indetail.    If his colleagues agreed with this view he asked their concurrence to his making an announcementat the end of Question-time on November 23rd in theterms set out in the draft reply attached to his memorandum.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That in the present politicalsituation it would be inadvisable to make a detailed statement as suggested in C.P .-271 (33):(b) That the Home Secretary should give   .a short answer, in which he should indicate that the Government   have followed the policy that successive governments have pursued, during thelast nine years and which was referredto by the Lord President of the Councilin his speech in the house of commons on November 10, 19 32.
3. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Health (C.P.-275 (33)) on thesubject of rural water supplies, the improvementof which he described as one of the most pressingproblems in local government.   The Minister was convinced that in many rural parishes it was not practicable to obtain a decent water supply unlessGovernment help was forthcoming, which he estimatedat  1,000,000.    The preparation, approval and execution of schemes would take not less than three years, and the charge on the Exchequer forthe first year would not be more than about  200,000.The Minister recommended that the grant should bein the form of a capital sum rather than of paymentstowards annual loan charges .    The Chancellor of theExchequer had concurred in the above proposals,which were now submitted for the approval of theCabinet.    Legislation would be required, but itshould not be controversial.After discussion, the Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the proposals of theMinister of Health as set forth in C.P.-275 (33):(b) that the grant should be made inthe form of a capital grant andnot payments towards annual loan charges:(c) To take note that the Chancellorof the Exchequer was prepared tomake a proportionate grant forcorresponding development of water supplies in Scotland:(d) To take note that the Minister ofHealth would do his best to encourage the development, without government grant, of drainage and sewerageworks pari passu with the new water supplies:(e) To take note that the Minister ofHealth would give consideration toa proposal that, in appropriate cases, assistance might be given tolandowners who might be willing,with such assistance, to provide ruralwater supplies.      It was suggested to the.Minister of Health that the
best way of carrying out thisproposal might be by way ofcontributions from CountyCouncils, who would, so to speak, frank the scheme underwhich assistance was given tolandowners from the Government grant to take note that the Ministerof Health would co-operate withthe Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries (particularly in connec-tion with securing &quot;co-operation from land drainage authorities)in the preparation of the Bill:That the Minister of health should, complete the Bill as soonas possible and submit it to theCommittee of Home Affairs with aview to early approval by theCabinet:^hat the Lord President of theCouncil should refer to the Billin the forthcoming Debates on theOpposition Amendment    to the Addressand should mention the intention ofthe Government to push the matter on with all speed.
2 0 3THE DEBATE 4.    In the course of the discussion referredON TFE ADDRESS ,to in the preceding Conclusion the Prime Ministermentioned that he had discussed the arrangementsfor the Debate on the Address -with the Parliament -ary Secretary to the mreasury, who would informMinisters of the dates on which it was proposedthat they should speak in the Debate.
government policy .(previous reference es:Cabinet 53(53), Con-clusion 1:and cabinet 55(33), Con-elusion 4.)5. The Cabinet again had under consideration the note by the Prime Minister (C.P.-231 (33)), -whichhad been before them at the Meetings referred to inthe margin, on Government Policy in regard to questionsof tirgent importance, including the following:-(a) The general international outlook.(b) A.Buflget surplus and the questionof the cuts, etc:    principles, asto its disposal.(c) Unemployment:(i) The &quot;residuum&quot; of unemployed,(ii) Provision for discipline andtraining of adolescents.The Prime Minister said that the discussion of(a). The general international outlook, had alreadybeen arranged for in a different manner (see conclusion 1).As regards (b), he thought that an earlydiscussion of the use to which a Budget surpluswas to be put might save a good deal of time andtrouble.He thought also that a frank discussion onthe points in (e), Unemployment, without necessarilykeeping any Minute, might be very valuable from apolitical point of view.
COMMERCIAL 6. The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by theNFGOTIAT IONSWITH FOREIGN   President of the Board of ^rade (CP,-274 (33))COUNTRIES.  informing his colleagues of the progress of theFrench Dis-criminatory     discussions with the French Government on the subjectMeasures,of discrimination against- United Kingdom goods and(Previous of the new proposals advanced by the French government reference:Cabinet 59 The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to a(33), Con-clusion 10.) telegram published in &apos;,rT,he Tiroes&quot; of the prei^ious dayindicating that the British Chamber of Commercein Paris had addressed an appeal to the Presidentof the Board of Trade to stand firm, and that theFrench cotton industry had addressed a letter tothe Minister of Commerce explaining the importanceit attached to the surtax on British goods.The President of the Board of Trade stated thatM&quot;. Laurent-Eynac, the French Minister of Commerce,was to have visited London last week.    He had firstpostponed his visit from Tuesday to Thursday, thenfrom Thursday to that week, and now indefinitely.He understood that M. Bonnet and M. Laurent-Fynacfelt their position to be somewhat paradoxical, inview of the pledges they had given.    He undertook toreport to his colleagues whatever progress was made.
JUDGES&apos; SALARIES.    7.   The Lord Chancellor drew the attention of(Previous       the Cabinet to Lord Buckmaster&apos;s Motion for reference:Cabinet 48   Thursday, November 83rd, on Judges&apos;  Salaries,(33), Con- .elusion 18) .which was as follows:.-, &quot;To move to resolve that this Houseo$(j)&quot;3)l, is of opinion that there cannot beany true liberty, unless the Judges-of the Supreme Court are entirelyindependent of the executiveGovernment, and to attain thatresult, they should not only beirremovable except by an Addressfrom both Houses of Parliament,but their salaries should not be diminished during their continu-ance in office.&quot;&apos;He recalled, the decision of the Cabinet onJuly 19, 19 33.  that the Judges should be invitedto obtain the signatures of all their colleagues,being informed that if they did so the Governmentwould proceed with legislation relieving the Judgesfrom the compulsion imposed by the Act and Orderin Council, and at the same time containing suchrecitals as would make it clear that the independ-ence of the Judges was unimpaired, by what had&apos;beendone in the past and remained in the future as itwas before the passing of the Economy Act (Cabinet47 (33), Conclusion 7).     This decision could notbe carried   out as the Judges would not give theirsignatures.    He read a formula which he proposedto use in his speech on the subject.The Prime Minister thought it would be wrong to ask the Judges to join in a declaration withthe Government.   If the Government thought stich adeclaration right they ought to m^-ke it independ-ently.The Secretary of State for War pointed outthat some of the cuts that were being imposedwere actually illegal, and that if the Law Lordsobjected to their cuts it might be necessary to-IS-
pass legislation.    In that event it might be-useful to couple with the legislation somedeclaration.The Prime Minister agreed that in that even this remark would not apply ,The Cabinet agreed  That the Lord Chancellor should basehis remarks on the following formof words:-&quot;Mo-one in authority desiresor has desired to undermineor minimise the independence and the prestige of the Judges,and should there be any doubtupon this subject the government might deem it advisable to askYour Lordships to join in passinga Declaratory Act of Parliamentto this effect&quot;.
MALTA, P.   The Secretary of State for the colonies informed the Cabinet that the question of Malta(previous reference: -was going to be raised by Lord Strickland in theCabinet 59(33), Con- House of Lords,   After referring to a suggestionelusion 1.)made by the Governor of Malta that his positionf.R.nfikjf. ought to be made clear by Act of Parliament, andhis own reply to the effect that he already had full powers under the Constitution, the Secretaryof State suggested that the spokesman of theColonial Office in the House of Lords should be instructed to take the following line:-(i) The government of Malta must be inthe hands of the Governor.    It wouldbe utterly premature to consider what should be the ultimate constitutional development in Malta:(ii) He should remind the House that whenthe Labour Government suspended theConstitution the Governor had carriedon for two years :(iii) He should also recall that whenImperial Parliament restored repre-sentative government in Malta it wasmade plain that certain conditions must be observed and express power was reserved to the Governor to ass timethe government of the Island:(iv) He should mention that the events whichhave made it necessary for the governor to act have been plainly stated and generally approved:(v) He should make, clear that in presentconditions the Governor must remain responsible for a considerable time:and that(vi) This would ensure that the policy onwhich Parliament rightly insisted, inMaltese and Imperial interests, wouldbe carried out and that the financialposition would be restored, whichmust necessarily be a work of time.If Lord Strickland should press his ownclaims to office, he should be toldquite plainly that no election was contemplated, and that in the conditionsof local politics now obtaining in Maltasuch a course would be contrary both to Maltese and Imperial interests.The Cabinet approved the above proposals.
THE UNEMPLOYMENT 9.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer reportedINSURANCE BILL,1933. that he, with the Minister of Labour and theMinister of Health, had had conferences with Local(previous reference: Authorities on the financial conditions of theCabinet 60(33). Con- Unemployment Insurance Bill.   At first the repre-elusion 3.)senjfcatives of the Local Authorities had stood out for stiff terms, but eventually substantial agree-ment had been reached, This, iie explained later,was not a formal agreement, as the Local authorities were only in a position to report to their parentbody. He thought, however, that their objectionshad been overcome.The Secretary of State for Scotland said thathe was about to undertake negotiations with scottish local Authorities, but owing to different conditionsin Scotland he could not promise that they would beso successful as those reported by the Chancellorof the Exchequer,
THE AMERICANDEBT .Sir frederick leith-Ross&apos; return.(previous reference:Cabinet 59(33), Con-clusion 6.)10. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet that according to reports from HisMajesty*s Ambassador in Washington Sir frederick leith-Ross had made a very favourable impressionthere&apos;, and his knowledge, tact and experience hadbeen much appreciated.   He was due in England thes ame day ,The Cabinet agreed  &apos;That Sir Frederick Leith-Rossshould be invited to attend anearly Meeting of the Cabinet togive them some account of his -impressions and experiences in washington.
TFK POLTOarCOMMITTEE.(previous reference:Cabinet 59(33); Con-clusion 2 .)11.    On the suggestion of the Prime Minister,slightly amended as the result of discussion, theCabinet agreed  (a) To set up a new Committee, to be known as The Poli^jf Committee:fb) niat for the moment the Terms ofReference should be as follows:-&quot;To enquire into the mattersdiscussed at the Cabinet on  November, 19 33 (Cabinet 59(33), Conclusion 2)&quot;,but that the Committee should beentitled to discuss its Terms ofReference at its first meeting:(c) that the membership should be.asfollows:-The Prime Minister,The Lord President of the Council,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Lord Chancellor,The Secretary of State for War,mhe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The Secretary o^ State for DominionAffairs,The Secretary of State for Air,The President       the Board of Trade,The First Commissioner of Works.The Prime Minister instructed theSecretary to remind him to arrangean early meeting.
THE IRISHFREE STATE.(previous reference:Cabinet 61(33), Oon-clusion 5.)12.   The Secretary of state for DominionAffairs said that his statement, approved by theCabinet in the Conclusions referred to in the margin, had been well received in this country.The tenor of Mr de Valera&apos;s reply had been ineffect to ask whether, in the event of the IrishFree State becoming a republic, no guns or battle-ships would be used against them.    Questions hadbeen put down in Parliament enquiring what was theGovernment&apos;s attitude towards Mr de Valera&apos;squestions .   He would not ask for a decision fromthe Cabinet that day.    One suggestion for the reply was to say frankly that we did not contem-plate the use of ships or guns, but that if theIrish F&apos;ree State declared itself a republicits citizens would be treated as aliens, with allthe consequences involved.Another suggestion made at the Cabinet wasthat it would be wise to keep the Irish FreeSt at e colleagues s ing.^he Secretary of State for Dominion affairs asked the Cabinet to turn the question over intheir minds, as he intended to lay the matter before them at their Meeting in the following week, and he would arrange for the Questions inParliament to be postponed until after that meeting....2, whiteha 11 Gardens , S .W . 1,November 22, 19 33.
