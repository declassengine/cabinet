REDUCTION and limitation of armaments.The german withdrawal.British Policy.(previous reference:Cabinet 53(33),  Con-clusion 3.)p1. The Cabinet had before them the following Papersby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs:-CP.-340 (33)&quot;   entitled &quot;Material for deciding British Policy in view ofGermany&apos;s withdrawal from the Disarm-ament Conference&quot;.    This document v/asdivided into four Parts, viz.:-Part I,   A summary of recent events inconnection with the DisarmamentConferencePart II.    a formulation of the questionsof policy and action now immedi-ately arising, with an indication of certain alternative courses .Part III.   A Note on the Treaty of Locarnoand our obi! gations under it.Part IV.   Containing some tentativeconclusions, provisionalacceptance of which would serve to narrow the problemof our immediate policy.C.P.-243 (33), circulating in connectionwith the above Memorandum a record of a conversation the Secretary of State had had with the German Ambassador on the evening of Friday,  October 20th.CP.-243 (33), circulating records of communications which had passed in thelast few days with the French andItalian Governments regarding theimmediate time-table of the DisarmamentConference ,The immediate point before the Cabinet was todecide what should be the attitude of the british delegation when the Bureau, of the Disarmament Confer-ence met on the 25th Instant to formulate its advice to be given to the General Commission at its Meetingon the 26th Instant as to the future of the Conference.In order to decide this question the Cabinet found itnecessary to look a little further ahead and toconsider in a preliminary way what their future policy and procedure v/ere. to be.Suggestions (l) to (4), in paragraph 43 of CP.-240(33)  (See Conclusion (a) below-) were adopted as a guide to their general policy.
A more difficult point was as to the methods bywhich that policy was to be pursued,    ^here were foundto be many factors of uncertainty in the situation:e.g.% the possibility that the French Government mightfall tonight:    as well as doubts as to whether Hitler&apos;sreal intentions were peaceful or the reverse, whichwould probably involve sooner or later some personalcontact with him.    It was suggested as possible that hitler&apos;s resort in the international sphere to Fascistmethods in withdrawing from the League of Nations.and the Disarmament Conference might necessitate the inauguration of some new system for carrying on inter-national relations.The following suggestions were discussed:-That if M, Daladier remained in office,France should be encouraged to respond toHitler&apos;s overtures to embark on conversations with Germany.    She should not be pressed toohard, to do this, as in that case she might ask for concessions or guarantees from thiscountry:That advantage should be taken of thevery friendly attitude of S. Mussolini towardsthe United Kingdom and France to concertour future policy closely with him:A suggestion by the Secretary of Statefor War that we should endeavour,  in conversations with France and Italy, to try and arrive at some agreement forqualitative disarmament under which thethree.Governments should agree to dispense with certain of the heavier classes of weapons now as a first step towards disarm-aroent, but with a provision making itsubject to other nations coming in.-2-
HiAny stich offer would have to include general supervision over all the nations concerned.If any considerable measure of agreement were reached on such a plan an offer might be madeto Germany which might be sufficiently attractive for her to accept.    If that were achieved,  the question of quantitativedisarmament might be tackled in the same way:That in any Conversations that took place,particularly with Germany, endeavour shouldbe made to survey the whole international situation, not merely from the point  ofview of Disarmament, but   what was moreimportant in view of recent developments  from the point of view of the maintenanceof peace .The Cabinet agreed  GENERAL POLICY, (a) To approve the following recommenda-tions contained in paragraph 45 of. C,P.-240 (.33) as to the general policyof the Cabinet:-&quot;(l) A policy of isolation is not practicable.(2) Our policy is still to seek by international co-operation thelimitation and reduction of worldarmaments, as our obligation underthe Covenant and as the only means to prevent a race inarmaments .(3) It is dangerous to seek this by continuing, the Conference in itspresent form without Germany.(4) It is important to maintain contact with Germany, both because her( assent is essential to a convention and as the best means  of securing that she does not commit herselfto re-armament in isolation orto a denunciation of the Treatyof Versailles&quot;.
Pending an exchange of views withother Governments, it was consideredpremature to take any decision on thequestion of &quot;sample&quot;-weapons raised in the succeeding three tentativeconclusions  (5),   (6) and (7)  ofparagraph 43 of C .P .-240 (33), fromwhich the above conclusions are quoted.(b) that members  of the Cabinet should beentitled to base their attitude in public speeches  on (a)  (l) arid (2) abc-v?OUR ATTITUDEAT GENEVA.(c)(d)That at the forthcoming Meetings ofthe Bureau and the General Commissionof the Disarmament Conference,  theattitude of the British representative should be as follows:-In accordance with (a)(3) above,generally to associate himself with the views expressed privatelyby the French and Italian Govern-ments in favour of a postponement(in the absence of the german delegation) of work on theDisarmament Convention:(ii)To endeavour to secureConference should be anot to any particularat the call of the Chato give time to studyin all its bearings an action as may be foundsecure peace and to prament. It was especiato avoid any date relaGerman Flections.that thedjourneddate, butin ordersituationd to take suchpossible toomote disarm-lly desirableted to thelr,the(iii)To avoid taking the lead in proposing the adjournment of theConference.   This might be accom-plished by indicating to thePresident of the Conference thenature of the messages which hadbeen received from the French andItalian Governments on the subject:but he should not be informed thatthe Cabinet had themselves taken &apos;adecision:That as no other Foreign Minister was likely to be present at Geneva, theUnited Kingdom Delegation should berepresented by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs:rUTURE PROCEDURE, (e) That as soon as possible after the. adjournment of the Disarmament Confer-ence, conversations should be enteredupon &quot;with France, Italy and Germany,while keeping in close touch with theUnited States of America:    but that atthe present moment the situation was toouncertain for any decision to be taken as to the order in which the conversa-tions should be begun,  or as to how far it should follow the lines suggested, inthe discussion and. summarised above:
