2.       The Cabinet had before them a Note by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C.P.-27Q (35)) on thesubject of the Financial Position in Newfoundland,indicating how this question had developed since the circulation of his previous Paper (C.P.-203 (33)) inAugust last, in which he had outlined a plan for thefuture Government of the Dominion and. for making provision for its public debt.   Lord Amulree&apos;commission had now signed a Report in conformity withthat plan, and the Prime Minister of the Dominionhad undertaken to do his best to get the recommenda-tions through his Cabinet.    It was intended that theReport should be published on the 21st Instant, andthat on the same date a White Paper should be issuedcontaining the terms of the United Kingdom financial proposals in detail.    If the Newfoundland Government-accepted the Commission^ recommendations, theprogramme thereafter would be (approximately):-November 30th       ...     Address by the Newfound-land Legislature to theKing, petitioning for anew Constitution.December 4th ...     Introduction at West-minster of FinancialResolutions preceding the Newfoundland Consti-tution Amendment Bill(which must be passed into law before Christmas),In addition, the Cabinet had before them adraft of the above-mentioned White Paper r0oP.-273(33)), which had been eirculated to them immediately before the Meeting held that morning.
Discussion revealed that the objectionsto the course proposed were not inconsiderable.      Thearrangement was likely to be criticised, not onlyon constitutional grounds, but as being mainly ofoenefit to American investors.       This would becontrasted with the conditions of our own unemployed and the inability of the Government to do anything tohelp the Victoria settlers (on which a recentParliamentary debate had revealed rather strong feelings).        It was clear, however, that no othersolution was in sight.-    There was no possibility, forexample, of uniting Newfoundland with the Dominion ofCanada or of the sale of Labrador to Canada or of thepresent administration       Newfoundland being able toset the matter right.      The only alternative,  therefore,was a default by the oldest of the self-governingunits of the Empire, and the reactions of this onTrustee Stocks and Dominion Securities were felt to be so serious as to outweigh the disadvantages.The cost of the scheme was given as about  250,000a year f^e^ three years.The Cabinet agreed:-To approve the proposals in CP. 270 (33),as well as the issue of the &quot;White Paperattached to CP.  273 (33).it
THE AS SYRIAw       3*     The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byQUESTION. n .    ^   or,rtthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-272(35)) on the Assyrian Question, in which it was(previous reference:    pointed out that a ruling by the Cabinet was urgentlyCabinet 53(33), Con-   required, as to whether His Majesty&apos;s Government xnelusion 9.)the United Kingdom would be prepared in principle toFX .make a contribution, and, if so, how much, towardsthe resettlement outside Iraq of those Assyrians who might wish to leave that country.    A project for settlement in Brazil appeared to be the only promisingsolution before the League of Nations committee dealing with the matter.    It was submitted in theMemorandum that a fair contribution would be 30 percent., with a maximum of  200,000, which could bemade conditional upon His Majesty&apos;s Government being satisfied by special investigation that the scheme on which their contribution was to be spent was agood one and that the rest of the money required wouldbe forthcoming..The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed outthat the question at issue was not so much financialas political.      If the case of Newfoundland was likely to be contrasted unfavourably with our inability to help the Victoria settlers, how would the latter case be contrasted with the provisionof a large sum to settle Assyrians in Brazil?He could not see why the United Kingdom alone shouldshoulder this burden.      It was said that we had some moral responsibility, but he compared this with the responsibility of a person who gives a
reference to an employe   who subsequently turns outdishonest.      This was really a matter for the Leagueof Nations.      In support of this he quoted CP,  272 (33),paragraph 18, as follows:-&quot;Although the statements made &quot;by Sir percy cox at the Constantinople Conference and in theBritish memorandum of the 14th August. 1924, mayhe quoted as a rfaecn why His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should now make some special contri-bution towards Assyrian settlement, it is clear from the above that the main responsibilityfor the failure to settle the Assyrians lies with the Council of the League, and that HisMajesty&apos;s Government are to a large extentabsolved from their admitted obligations by thestrenuous tfiorts which they made to securethe settlement of the Assyrians, free from Turkishrule, in their old homes in Hakkiari territory.&quot;He was prepared to pay our share as a member of theLeague, but he thought that it would be extremelydifficult to ask the House of Commons for more than this.The political difficulty of going fartherthan the Chancellor of the Exchequer had suggestedwas generally assented to.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsag3?eedthat it was a decision of the League of nations that had led to the present situation.    We could notignore, however, the servioes rendered by the assyrians to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Iraqlevies and Sir Francis Humphreys&apos;s statement beforethe Permanent Mandates Commission in 1931 as to the&quot;moral responsibility&quot; of His Majesty&apos;s Government,If we made no special contribution we should be opento the criticism that this was tantamount to adeclaration that we had never been the Mandatory forTr&amp;a.The Secretary of State for India urged that-6-
the matter would, be easier to defend if the Assyrianscould be settled in some part of the Empire.      he emphasised the urgency of a settlement since otherwise there.might be yet another massacre.The Secretary of State for Air asked if theTurks could not take them back,  but this was deemedimpossible.The Cabinet were reminded that at one timethe French had shown a disposition to allow the assyrians to settle in Syria,, but now they had changed their attitude.The Cabinet agreed:-(a) That the League of Nations should beInformed that in the view of HisMajesty&apos;s Government the cost of settling the Assyrians should be borneby the League itself, and that theywere willing to pay their share.(b) That pressure should be put on theGovernment of Iraq, to increase their contribution.
CABINET PROCEDURE4       t       *Circulation of papers.(previous reference:Cabinet 56 (32)Conclusion 2.)44 The Prime Minister called theattention of his colleagues to the growingtendency to Ignore the rule adopted by the Cabinetthemselves for their own convenience that an interval of five days should elapse between the circulation of Cabinet memoranda and their being placed on the Agenda Paper of the Cabinet.    Itwas very inconvenient to have papers circulated for a Wednesday cabinet after the beginning of the week, and it was evendangerous as the Cabinet sometimes had to take decisions when he himself and other members hadnot had time to read the papers.      More oftenthan not the contraventions of the rule werein respect of really important subjects, althoughfrom the point of view of the &quot;properconduct of business, the more important thesubject, the more time was required to ponderover it.The Prime Minister said that it was his intention to adhere to the Cabinet rule,  if notto the extent of 100 per cent., at any rate as nearly as possible to that standard.3, Whitehall Gardens, SvW.1.,16th November,  1933,
