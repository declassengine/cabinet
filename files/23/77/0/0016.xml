NEGOTIATIONS The Cabinet held a Special Meeting for theBETWEEN INDIAAND JAPAN IN purpose of considering the following docisnents onREGARD TO THECOTTON TRADE.        the subject of the negotiations between India and japan in regard to the cotton trade, which had(previous reference: reached a critical position:-Cabinet 57(33), Con- A Memorandum by the Secretary of elusion 2,) State for India (CP.-282 (33))fo stating, inter alia, that percentages. ,had been agreed upon for the variousb6(3^6. categories of the quota of cotton goods to be imported by Japan, butthat in the case of each categorya &quot;tolerance&quot; should be allowed,so that if for any reason the quotaunder any particular category wasnot reached, the quota under anothercategory might, within certain limits,be increased.   The Japanese proposal was that the tolerance should be fixed in the case of each category at 10per cent, of the whole quota, and theGovernment of India proposed to concedethis figure,   The Secretary of Statev/as concerned, however, with thepolitical results which might followif Lancashire regarded this concessionas disastrous to their trade:A Memorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade (CP .-283 (33))pointing out that if the Governmentof India made this concession HisMajesty&apos;s Government would have to face the severest criticism fromLancashire.   The President therefore .asked the Cabinet (l) to suggest tothe Government of India the necessityfor refusing to give way to the Japanesedemand, and&quot;(2) to say that if theJapanese fear of not being able toreach the full quota of &quot;plain greys&quot;should prove to be well founded, weshould not object to an offer to reconsider the duties on these goods.In stating the facts of the situation and thepossible dangerous political reactions in Japan,India and the United Kingdom respectively, of thevarious courses open to us, the Secretary of Statefor India emphasised that if the Government of Indiadid not accept the view of the CabineT)they couldjy order/.   He w^p&amp;tsot be over-ridden by order/,that under the pressure of the Indian cotton-growersthe^      Q^fi^nrn^rrrt-^^^Mis, would have t-e- rejectour views.   He suggested, therefore,that the best plan would be to fall back on the proposal of a 5$-1-
transfer, for which strong arguments had been givenby the Government of India within the last three orfour days,The President of the Board of Trade, afterdealing with the question at some length in its political aspects, expressed the hope that thesubject was not being regarded by the Government ofIndia solely in its Indian aspects.   Be pointed outthat as a result of the Ottawa Agreements there hadbeen a great increase in our imports from india of various commodities, particularly linseed, pig-iron and raw and manufactured jute.   The Board ofTrade had been subjected to severe criticism onthis account, and it ?-ould be a poor return forthese advantages if India were to make an-agreementwith Japan injurious to our trade.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs recalled that at an earlier stage of this affairstress had been laid, in communications with theJapanese Ambassador, on our inability to interferewith India in these matters, owing to the FiscalConvention that had been adopted since theMontagu-Ohelmsfo^d reforms .    ^he Japanese Ministerfor Foreign Affairs was now urging that the diffi-culties which had arisen in Simla were due to the intervention of the British Government, and was even making charges of bad faith.   These charges would have to be met.   Although we could not dictateto the Government of India, we had the right, whichevery country possessed, to make representations asto the effect- which their fiscal proposals wouldhave on our own interests.   He read a draft telegram which he had prepared, making appropriate representa-tions to Japan.   The Secretary of State added that,if these negotiations resulted in a breakdown between- 1 &apos; j
the Indian and Japanese Governments, he hoped thatcare would be taken that the Japanese refusal couldnot be laid at the door of Lancashire.   The break-down, if it occurred, must be on some ground thatthe Government of India could defend in its own interests.   He also pointed out that the ultimatereactions of a breakdown at Simla might be veryserious indeed:    for example, in its bearing on apossible Pan-Asiatic movement.The Secretary of State for the Colonies suggestedthat in dealing with India there was no question ofour &quot;dictating&quot; a policy, since our whole case couldbe based on the Ottawa Agreements.    India, of her own free will, had come into economic partnership with us,    Indian representatives had negotiated theAgreement purely as a matter of good business forIndia.    zone first intention had been that theAgreement should be,for six months, but they had.asked that it should be extended to three years .The basis of the Ottawa Agreements had been theinterests of each part of the Empire first, of otherparts of the Empire second, and of foreign nationsthird.   We had, therefore, an absolute right to demand, that our interests should take second placein the Simla negotiations .    If India were to injureour interests while benefiting her own, we shouldbe entitled to demand, a reopening of the ottawa agreements, from which, as the President of theBoard of-Trade had shown, India was deriving great advantages.    He also pointed out that if Indiaconcluded an agreement on the lines now contemplated,the representatives of Lancashire who had latelyreturned, from India would be unable to securenomination from the cotton industry to representit at the forthcoming negotiations in London, and
the Government -would find themselves in an embarrassedposition and might have to denounce the Anglo-Japanese Treaty.The President of the Board of mracie confirmedthis latter point.The Secretary of State for India said that in both his official and private and personal communi-cations with India he had made the utmost use ofthe Ottawa Agreements.   He thought, however, thatthe argument did not appeal very strongly to theIndian Government,  owing to their obsessions withthe plight of the ootton-growers ,   His advisers held the view that if the Indian cotton-growers, whosecrops were now maturing, could somehow be tided over until February, the position vfce4*N* right itself.Japan had stocked herself with cotton until February;after that she would have to buy ,   At present theJapanese negotiators were using the position created by the fall in the value of the Dollar to threaten to make their purchases in America at low prices.He was informed, however, by experts, that theamount of American cotton that the Japanese millscould use was limited by the fact that much of theirmachinery was designed to use the short-stapleIndian cotton and could, not be used for the long-staple American eotton.   The latter cotton couldonly be used ex^e^ms4v^eiy if the Japanese thought itThe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriessuggested that the Indian cotton-growers might betided over until February by putting an anti-dumpiigduty on the depreciated Dollar and by using the proceeds   at any rate so far as cotton imports were concerned   to finance the Indian cottongrowers.   Lancashire, it was true, would not obtainworth while to purchase new machi
the advantage of the lower price due to the depre-ciated Dollar, hut at any rate the industry would pay no more for its raw material than before, andmight derive considerable advantages.. tj        I    The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested thatfo^j- t h^t, m fjh-in mr prffprrtlti ought to be examined by a Cabinet/t^/-        /Committee, as it was impossible to appreciate all- their reactions without further investigation.The Secretary of State for India pointed outthat the Government of India were to have met theJapanese Delegation that very morning, but the meeting had been postponed, at his request, until the morrow.There was every reason to believe that the JapaneseDelegates would then press for a decision.Various suggestions were made at this point forUUuCliXUJ.w.p.,    cm     \j. O x Cb y      Is j      uu*^ v      : a xli.1 ^xi \j     v.&apos; J.     JL. j. l\JL X Cb     -i-i. ireaching a decision.The Prime Minister thought that if any suchmessage was sent the Government of India should be reminded of the Ottawa Agreements, the advantages that they had. received by the increase of certainIndian exports to this country, and of the dangersthat the Government of India were running of making it impossible to secure the adoption in this country of a Constitutional settlement on the lines of theWhite Paper.    In fact, the whole case should be setout and India should be asked to hold up a decision until the Cabinet had concluded its examination.Suggestions were also made for the despatch of astrong telegram to Japan. One suggestion was that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsmight with advantage see the Japanese ambassador and discuss the whole situation with him,
The Secretary of State for India was doubtful,as to the wisdom of this proposal, since it might encourage the Japanese in their allegation that asettlement was being, prevented by Lancashire.There was general agreement that the utmost care should be taken in any communication to Japan,whatever the form, to avoid talking of the interestsof Lancashire, and to use only the term &quot;UnitedKingdom&quot;.Th^ Prime Minister suggested that these were all matters which might be referred, if necessary, tothe Cabinet Committee, if such were appointed.The Secretary of State for Air informed theCabinet that he had been told in Lancashire thatthe Americans were sending cotton out of thecountry without demanding payment, in order tocreate credits in foreign countries in view of possible eventualities .   ^he Japanese,  therefore,would have no difficulty in obtaining such cottonfrom America as they were able to tise .The Secretary of State for India proposed tosend a draft telegram to the Viceroy of Indiaputting the views of the Cabinet, and withoutrefusing or accepting their proposal for a 5%transfer.   He would explain that the Cabinet were examining the question of tiding over the cotton crop, and would ask if they had any suggestion tomake for dealing with this question in the event ofa breakdown of the present negotiations.   Pendingthis examination he would ask for a delay in thedecision of the Government of India.The Secretary of State for War suggested that pressure might be put on the Japanese Ambassador,who was holding up negotiations here pending theresult of the Indian negotiations, to get on with
the business, owing to our difficulties with theLancashire representatives,mhe Cabinet agreed ---(a) That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows -mhe Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The Secretary of State for India,The Secretary of State for theColonies,The President of the Board of Trade -should meet at once to consider, inthe light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion and in consultation with experts ofthe Departments concerned, the negotia-tions between India and Japan in regardto the cotton trade, and more particularly the proposal that some means should befound for financing the Indian cotton crop up to February, 1934:(b) That the Secretary of State for india should send an appropriate message tothe Government of India in order tosecure a delay in reaching a decisionpending the above enquiries:(c) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, in consultation either withthe Committee or with the ministers concerned, should make a, communication to the Japanese Government explainingour rights and duties towards theGovernment of India under the FiscalConvention, making clear that we retainedthe right that every nation possessedto make representations as to the effecton our interests of fiscal pro-posals and rebutting the charges of bad faith.3, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,November 28, 1933.-?-
