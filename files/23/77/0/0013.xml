RFDUCT ION and limitation of armaments .&apos; previous reference:Cabinet 61(33), Con-clusion 1.)4^5) t2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsbrought before the Cabinet, as a matter of urgency,the question of Disarmament, which, he pointed out,had given rise to a situation with both international and domestic aspects.   Mr Arthur Henderson, thePresident of the Conference, was talking of resign-ing, and according to a telegram just received from geneva there was some possibility of his issuing ajoint public statement in conjunction with M.Politisand Dr. Eenes, the two Rapporteurs of the Bureau,to the effect that, having found no-one at Genevawith whom to discuss the matters with which theyhad been charged, they had no alternative but to surrender the mandate conferred upon them by the bureau.    Recent Debates had cleared up the situationso far as Parliament was concerned, but had not yetaffected outside public opinion, as could be judged from the Press .    In the circumstances he proposedto telegraph to Paris to the effect that either he or the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State would proceed to Geneva on Friday, calling at Paris onthe way.   He understood that Mr Henderson also wouldprobably be coming to Paris.   The question he raisedwas as to whether the British Government could afford,without loss of credit, to rest on their oars and merely adhere to the British Draft Convention, orwhether they ought not to take some initiative.The former course, he thought, would lead theGovernment into grievous trouble.   His view,therefore, was that some action should be taken tohelp both the Disarmament Conference and itsPresident.   The present position was that we had never abandoned the British Draft Convention.An idea was prevalent, however, that at the meetingof the Bureau on October 14th we had materially
altered our plan at the instance of Prance, and alarge body of opinion in this country held this view.He did not think we ought to reaffirm the amendmentsthen put as a basis for- discussion^ since- these hadalready been rejected by Germany.   He hoped, however,that the Cabinet would authorise an effort to putin some form any modifications by which they felt the Government could stand,   ^he parliamentary under-Secretary of State, who had given close atten-tion to the matter, thought this was possible andwas prepared to make suggestions.   He himself wouldlike to go to the Bureau and say that the cabinet had thoueht the whole matter over and suggested thatthe question should be dealt with on lines which hewould then announce.   He admitted that any proposals we eould make would not please the French, but he did not think we ought to be deterred for thisreason, since the French were too dependent on usto separate themselves for long.   The Italians also would not be entirely pleased, since they did not want to proceed with the work at Geneva at all.The United States would not be effectively repre-sented, and the utmost we could hope for from them was a friendly message.   The Germans would probablyreject any proposal that was made.   The proposal,therefore, to which he asked the Cabinet to agree in principle was that the only way of making progress was to revise the modifications to the British DraftConvention that had been contemplated in mid-october and rejected by the Germans.   These proposals wouldnot be identical with those he recently submittedto the Cabinet in CP.-255 (53), and would have tobe discussed.
In the course of the discussion it was pointedout that there were some signs that Prance did not wholly reject the idea of separate conversations with: the German Government, and it was suggestedthat the best plan for the United Kingdom Delegationmight be to fall back.on the original British DraftConvention and try and promote conversations betweenthe two countries ,    In favour of this course a number or advantages were urged;   e ,g,-, the Governmentwould be on a sound footing vis-a-vis our own people;we should avoid the discussion of technical detailswhich might raise dangerous issues;    we should avoid the necessity of presenting any detailed amendmentof our scheme;    and it would be difficult for germany, who had herself accepted, the Draft Conven-tion in principle, to raise objection.There was general agreement that the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs should return to Geneva,but considerable doubts were expressed as to whetherit was advisable for him to raise or be drawn into discussions of detail where controversial andinconvenient questions were liable to arise.Attention was drawn to a speech made byS. Mussolini, in which, according to Press reportsof the same day, he was reported, to havedepreciated the League of Nations .   Apprehensionswere expressed that this tended towards the possible and. in rivalry withcreation of a Fascist bloc outs ide^the League ofNat ions.The Cabinet were reminded tkiat the German argumentwas that we had altered the original British DraftConvention in two essential respects, viz., (l) bythe introduction of the principle of a period of probation^ which was implicit in the original draftConvention, but less baldly stated, and which Germany-6-
claimed applied, to all intents and purposes, onlyto her , and (2) that at the end of that period of probation there was no guarantee that other nations would disarm,    That argument might be wrong, but it made a considerable appeal in this country as wellas in Germany.    It was suggested that these two points ought to be seized upon and that the best plan would be for us to state (as had already beensuggested) that we were prepared to go back to theoriginal Draft Convention, but also to discuss whatamendments could be made therein to meet the diffi-culties of France without antagonizing Germany.The Prime Minister, who had discussed, thequestion on the previous evening with the lord president of the Council and the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, pointed out that Germany had left the Conference under a serious misapprehensionas to what had happened,   ^he British Government had never abandoned their original Draft Convention.There had been a number of conversations during august and September of the present year, and theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs had merelyreported what the tenor of those conversations was,and the nature of the amendments which were likelyto be moved by certain Powers as a result.   He had made no definite suggestions at the Bureau for amending the Convention, but merely a general reportof the results of the conversations .   His speech,comparable totherefore,  ought not to be described as^the proposalsfor a Draft Convention, which earlier he himself had submitted to the Conference.    In these circumstances he thought that the first step was to address theGerman Government with a view to removing thesemisapprehensions and thus place on record what had
already been made clear in Parliament as to the true position.A further suggestion was made that, as the PrimeMinister had himself introduced the British DraftConvention, it might be advantageous if he repre-sented the United Kingdom at Geneva, both to show the importance we attached to the present proceed-ings of the Conference and to ascertain what mod if i-cations might be introduced in order to satisfy allconcerned and enable progress to be made.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,while agreeing that the advantages of adherence tothe original Draft Convention had been stated in an attractive form, recalled that during the summerAwhile he himself was in South America) there hadbeen conversations with the French, at. which theParliamentary Under-Secretary of State and theSecretary of State for Air   and on one occasion the Lord President of the Council   had been present ,    At that time the grounds on which theoriginal Draft Convention had been based had begun to shift.   There had been a general recognition that the events following the advent of Hitler to power   such as the persecution of Jews andpacifists, and the militaristic tendencies ofthe Nazi movement   did involve some change of attitude.   The truth was, however, that publicopinion here had forgotten those events andsentiment had changed, with the result that appealsfor fair play to Germany were making   greaterheadway.   Nevertheless, in the conversations at paris with the French, and with other Powers atGeneva, the tendency had been towards stiffening
the Draft Convention.   If we were now to return tothe original British Draft Convention we should beasked whether all the alternative proposals were tobe jettisoned, and we should meet with a maximumo* protest from the French.   Fiirther, the germans would say that the British had abandoned theposition they had taken up during the last threemonths, and that would annoy the French more than ever.    If, on the other hand, we stood by the DraftConvention but recognised that some alterations of detail might be necessary, we should be in a better position.mhe Cabinet were reminded that our original proposals had been made on the.assumption thatGermany was to have equality of armaments in aregime of security    in which the League of Nationsoccupied a key position.   Germany had given notice to leave the League, and Italy seemed to be contem-plating similar action, which would materially alter the situation.   That was a point which ought to bemade at Geneva.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion tothe point that had been reached, thought there v/as general agreement that the United Kingdom delegation should retxirn to Geneva as soon as possible, not for the purpose of discussing or making proposalsof detail, but to make clear that we still stood bythe British Draft Convention in the conditions inwhich v/e had launched it;    and to remind the Bureauthat the statement was merely one of amendments tothe plan that were likely to be asked for duringthe expected discussions.   Beyond that he himself was doubtful whether at this stage our delegatescould do more than make enquiries as to how mattersstood and       use their ingenuity and resource to try
and find a solution.   He thought, also, that weshould be in a position of great advantage if,even before going to Geneva, we addressed ourselves to Germany in order to make olear that we had neverabandoned the British Draft Convention.   he realised, however, that these matters could notbe disposed of that morning.The Cabinet agreed  mo meet the same evening, in thePrime Minister&apos;s Room at the Houseof Commons, at 9 p.m,, mainly forthe purpose of continuing the dis-cussion on Disarmament......
ANGLO-soviet negotiations.(previous reference:Cabinet 53(33), Con-- elusion 8) ,3.     The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe President of the Board of Trade fC .P.-267 (33))on the subject of Anglo-Soviet Negotiations, to whichwas attached a Memorandum prepared in his Departmentshowing the present position.   After stating that agreement had now been reached on most points,setting forth the main points on which the present proposals differed from the old Agreement, and explaining the outstanding matters, the Presidenturged the importance of the negotiations beingconcluded a   an early date.In the course of discussion it was pointedout that under the proposals set forth in CP,-267 (33)the Lena Goldfields case would practically feeabandoned.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs suggested that that portion of the proposals shouldbe strengthened as follows that the Soviet negotiators should be told that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not recommend to Parliament the acceptanceof the trade agreement unless the ConcessionsCommittee at Moscow had previously given theLena Goldfields Company to understand that if negotiations with them were resumed, their previous offer would be materially improvedupon.The President of the Board of Trade undertook toconsider this proposal and before any agreement was signed to report to the Cabinet how this matterstood.The Cabinet \were reminded also that therewere a number of former creditors of Russia underthe pre-Bolshevik regime and it was suggested that ineffect they also were being abandoned.     According to
the Press the President of the United States wasinsisting on recognition of the corresponding -Americancreditors as a condition of a trade agreement, andthe Government would he in a weak position if we failed to secure terms as good as America,.      ThePresident of the Board of Trade said that the positionof the creditors referred to above had not been affected by previous agreements.      The Goschen Committeehad negotiated with the Soviet representatives for two years without making any progress.      He agreed,however, that in the final stages words would be usedto make clear that we were not abandoning our previousattitude towards these claims.The Cabinet were, also reminded that incertain banks in this country there were considerablesums of money that had belonged to the Russian (pre-Bolshevik) Government or to Russian banks which had since been abolished or wound up.      Some years agothere had been apprehensions lest the Soviet Governmentshould bring a case in our Courts to recover thesemonies, and at that time an assurance had been givento the British banks concerned that if they were suedand lost the case, the Government would pass legislation to prevent them from handing over the funds.      The suggestion was made that the Treasury andthe Board of Trade should consider the positionas the sum of money in the banks might be very usefulas a nucleus of a fund for meeting the Russiancreditors.The Secretary of State for War who had raised some of the above questions asked to placeon record that the objections he had registered in the past, to the whole policy had not been in anyway modified.
The Home Secretary pointed out the difficulties that judging from previous experience were liable to arise from the grant of diplomatic immunity to certain members of the Russian Trade Delegation. He was gladthat this concession had been severely limited, but he felt bound to warn the Cabinet that difficulties might arise.The Chancellor of the Exchequer warned theCabinet that the Board of Customs and Excise alsoldisliked the grant of diplomatic immunity, more particularly as a precedent for other countries to demand a corres-iponding privilege.     At the moment, however, the objection was somewhat academic and he would not press it.The Cabinet agreed:-I.      To take note&apos;of the main points    on whichthe present proposals differ from theold agreement (which gave the Sovietsunqualified most-favoured-nation treatment),and that the Russians are now prepared(a) to acknowledge in the Agreement our right to prohibit their goods ifthey are offered at prices that  &quot;frustrate&quot; Imperial preferences or that detrimentally affect our homeinterests.      This is an importantextension of the scope of Article 21of our agreement with Canada;(b) to accept our view that we cannot continue to buy largely from them while they buy so little from us.      They are willing to include in the agreementprovisions whereby they undertake soto adjust the business that there willbe (after an initial period for thechange-over) an approximate balance ofpayments under which the money they gethere for their goods will be spent here.l,e* from the timeof our raising theWest ion.II.      To approve the following proposals of thePresident of the Board of Trade:-(l) Period of Negotiation and Notice.- ^We may offer a period of three months ,to cover both negotiations and notice,this is the very least that the SovietGovernment are likely to accept, and could, we think, be defended by us.
23 ii(2) Immunity.&apos;-   Ve may agree to continuethe immunity in the same limitedform that was provided in the oldagreement.we should continue to press forassurances on the three pointsaffecting the Embassy at Moscow.    7/emight in the end give up the pointsas to the inspection of luggage and railway tickets, but we should insist on an assurance as regards food-stuffs.Note:The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsplaced it on record that an assurance asregards food-stuffs is essential, and the it^tKln^.majesty&apos;s&amp;g4*e*M-on of I*u-:ggage--and railway ticketswas also of some importance.      The questionof works of art was of less importance.III.     (a) Shipping.-    The incentive to charterBritish shipping provided by thebalance of payments agreement, althoughconsiderable, is not in our viewsufficiently direct, even if accompaniedby assurances of an undefined character,we should press for the inclusion in theagreement of a definite undertaking that not less than 50 per cent,  of thetonnage chartered by the Soviet Govern-ment should be British,(b) Herrings.-    We should press for a substantialpurchase by the Soviet Government.    Thiswould not form part of the main agree-ment, but might take the form of a sepa-rate purchase agreement.IV.    That the President of the Board of trade should consider the formula suggested by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs quoted above in this Conclusion, and that thePresident of the Board of Trade should reporton this subject to the Cabinet before any agreement was  signed.V.    To take note that in the final stages of theConference words would be used to make clearthat we are not in any way abandoning our previous attitude towards the claims ofBritish creditors in respect of pre-war debts.
4,       In accordance -with the decision referred toin the margin, the Cabinet had before them theConclusions of the Standing Ministerial Sub-Committeefor Questions concerning the Middle East, on thesubject of the proposed despatch of a &quot;British envoyto the Court of the Imam of the Yemen at Sanaa witha view to the conclusion of a Treaty (CP.-269 (33)).The conclusions of the Committee, who had had beforethem a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for theColonies (attaohed to CP.-S69 (33)) were recorded as follows:-&quot;(l) Having considered the whole question theyare satisfied, that the advantages of con-tinuing negotiations overweigh the dis-advantages and they accordingly recommendthat the Cabinet should adhere to itsprevious decision (Cabinet 50 (33),Conclusion 5):(2) That the Foreign Office should inform theItalian Government that Colonel Reilly, the resident at Aden, will go to Sanaa in orderto negotiate a Treaty, and that as it isthe common object of both the British andItalian Governments to prevent the outbreakof hostilities between the Imam and Ibn SaudColonel Reilly will take advantage of his presence at Sanaa to -use his best efforts to achieve this object:(3) That should hostilities actually break out between the Imam, and Ibn Saud a situation might arise in which it might be necessaryto reconsider this decis ion&quot; .The Cabinet adopted the Conclusions ofthe Cabinet Committee as set forth above.

THE SOUTHAFRICA HIGHCOMMISSIONTERRITORIES.Transfer tothe Union ofSouth Africa,8.      The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (C.P,-262(33)) on the subject of the transfer to the Union ofSouth Africa of the three South Africa High commission territories, viz,, Basutoland, the bechuanaland protectorate, and Swaziland.   The Memorandum statedthat when General Smuts and Mr Havenga had called todiscuss the matter with the Secretary of State inJuly last he had given them a note in which attentionhad been called to the various pledges given in thepast by His Majesty&apos;s Government as to consultationwith the inhabitants of the Territories and withParliament.   Subsequently General Smuts had sent him a Memorandum explaining the grounds on which theUnion Government considered that the Territoriesought to be transferred to the Union, and general hertzog had now sent a letter repeating the same view.Having recently had an opportunity of discussing thematter with the High Commissioner for South Africa,who had said that any proposal for transfer of the territories would meet with very strong opposition from the natives, the Secretary of State proposed to remind. General Hertzog of the pledges set out in thememorandum handed to General Smuts in July last andto say that it would clearly not be possible for HisMajesty*s Government in the United Kingdom even toconsider the question of transfer without taking stepsto ascertain the opinion of the population, both nativeand European, and that he and his colleagues felt thatthe present was not a suitable time for raising thisquestion with the native population of the Territories.

It was possiblethat action might shortly be taken by Australia andNew Zealand, which might stimulate the United states to take action against United Kingdom ships in trades in which this country was open to attack.A suggestion was made that the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs should inform theBritish Ambassador in Washington of the positionas set forth in CP. 250 (33) and ask him if hecould make contacts with a view to sounding whatwould be the attitude of the United States Govern-ment if he v/ere instructed to raise the questionofficially.The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs informed the Cabinet that when ^r, Brucehad first brought the question to his noticehe had warned him not only of the serious consequences which action by Australia and NewZealand might have on British shipping in trades in which this country is open to attack, but also of the danger that the whole principle of Imperial
preference might be raised internationally by theAmerican Government.The Cabinet agreed  fa) That the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should convey to the High Commissioner for Australia the strong feeling of the Cabinet as to the serious consequences of the threatenedaction by Australia and NewZealand:(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should inform theBritish Ambassador in Washingtonof the position and sound him as towhat was likely to be the attitudeof the United States government if he were instructed to raisethe question officially.2, Whitehall Gardens, S,W,l,November 15, 1933.
APPENDIX. I.Draft of The King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament.November 17, 1933.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :I REJOICE to observe the steady improvement in trade and employmentamong My People.Trade Agreements, which will, I trust, be found mutually advantageous,have been concluded with a number of foreign countries. Negotiations withother countries for the conclusion of similar Agreements will shortly be begun.I have been gratified to learn that the question of Flag Discrimination in portuguese ports, which has for some years been a subject of discussion, has nowbeen satisfactorily settled by an Agreement between My Government and thatof the Portuguese Republic.I had pleasure in welcoming to London in June last the delegates to the session of the World Monetary and Economic Conference. My Prime Ministeracted as President of the Conference at the request of the Council of the Leagueof Nations.Considerable progress was made with certain questions but owing tounexpected developments in the international monetary and financial situation the Conference was, to My regret, unable to reach conclusions on certain important matters before its adjournment on the 27th July. It is, however,satisfactory that a joint declaration as to their views on some of the principalsubjects raised at the Conference was drawn up by Delegations of the BritishCommonwealth and published. The Conference has left in being suitableorganisations charged with the task of fixing the date of reassembly and ofmaking the preliminary arrangements necessa^ for the purpose.My Government have throughout taken an active part at the DisarmamentConference, and the British Draft, which was presented on the 16th March, wasadopted in June last as the basis of the proposed Convention. I earnestly trust that the difficulties which have since arisen may be surmounted. The withdrawalof Germany a month ago from the deliberations at Geneva has necessarilydislocated the programme, but the work for international disarmament byagreement between nations must be vigorously pursued.Members of the House of Commons :I thank you for the provision you have made for the public service.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :The continued willingness of My People to bear heavy sacrifices has made it possible for this country, almost alone among the great countries of the world, tomaintain a satisfactory balance between its national income and expenditure.Confidence has been restored by the pursuit of a sound financial policy,accompanied by the establishment of a reasonable measure of protection forthe industry of the United Kingdom. The steps taken to promote there organisation of various sections of agriculture and the sea-fishing industry have not yet had time to show their full results, but I am pleased to note thatthere are already definite signs of improvement.(9266)
The numbers of the unemployed, though still unhappily far too large, havefallen substantially and continuously in recent months, despite the usual seasonaltrend in the opposite direction.Bills have received My assent providing for the amendment and continuation of the Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts, for the reorganisation ofLondon passenger transport, for the licensing and regulation of goods motor vehicles, for the consolidation of the law relating to children and young persons and for the amendment of the law relating to the national status of marriedwomen.A number of other Measures of public utility have been passed into law.I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your labours.
APPENDIX. II.Draft of The King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.November 21, 1933.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons:MY relations with foreign Powers continue to be friendly.The central purpose of My Government in international affairs is topromote and to sustain, by every means in their power, peace in the world.With this object in view,* My Government will continue to co-operate withother Governments in endeavouring to reach a satisfactory solution of thecomplicated questions of disarmament in order to achieve a settlement acceptable to all and to attain fruitful results from the prolonged labours ofthe Disarmament Conference. My Government remain determined to uphold thework of international co-operation by collective action through the machineryof the League of Nations and in all other ways calculated to further good relations between all States and peoples.During the past Session a Joint Committee of both your Housesconsidered, in conference with delegates from India, proposals for Indianconstitutional reform. You will be invited to re-constitute the Committee, and my Ministers hope that the Committee may find it possible to complete theirarduous task in time to enable definite proposals, in legislative form, to belaid before you during the coming Session. I am deeply conscious of the burdenof responsibility which lies upon all those whose duty it is to guide or to take decisions as to the form of the future government of My Indian Empire, and Ipray that wisdom may inform their judgment.The Report of the Royal Commission on Newfoundland is about to be laidbefore you, and any legislation which may be found necessary in connection withtheir recommendations will be submitted to you.Members of the House of Commons :The Estimates for the public services will be laid before you in due course.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :The past year has been marked by a steady growth of confidence in thefuture prospects of British trade and industry. In the opinion of my government it is of the first importance that this confidence should bemaintained and increased, since it lies at the root of any lasting improvementin the condition of the country.By careful attention to sound principles both in the control of expenditure and in measures calculated to encourage enterprise My Ministers will endeavourto promote the return of the nation, step by step, to conditions which will permit the easing of its present burdens.My Ministers will continue their efforts to create favourable conditions for the export trade, especially by the negotiation of trade agreements. In thisway it is hoped that opportunities will be afforded for the development of thecotton, coal and other exporting trades.(9268)
You will be invited to give immediate consideration to a comprehensiveMeasure which will put the Unemployment Insurance scheme on a sound and permanent footing and will establish .a new system for the assistance and welfare of the unemployed outside insurance.My Ministers intend, in conjunction with the Local Authorities, to pressforward with the improvement of housing conditions by the clearance orreconditioning of houses unfit for human habitation, and their replacement,when demolished, by dwellings which accord with modern standards and can belet at reasonable rents.Measures dealing with the law relating to betting and gambling, the continuation of a beet sugar subsidy for another year, the reconditioning ofworking-class houses and regulating the hours of employment of young persons and other conditions in the distributive trades will be submitted to you.Bills relating to Scotland will be introduced to accelerate the provision ofsmall holdings, to deal with illegal trawling, to amend the poor law, and forother purposes.Other Measures of importance will be laid before you and proceeded withas time and opportunity offer.And I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon yourdeliberations.
