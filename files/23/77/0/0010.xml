MALTA.(previous reference:Cabinet 51(35), Con-clusion 3.)4^)81.   The Secretary of State for the colonies informed the Cabinet that the Maltese Ministry hadtoday refused to accept conditions put to them bythe Governor, who had declared, an &quot;Emergency&quot;,taken over the government and dismissed the MalteseParliament.    A Statement would be published almost immediately by the Colonial Office.
iHOUSE OP LORDSgSPORM.2,        The first item of the Agenda was discussedbriefly and generally.      Certain important mattersemerged, and it was agreed, without prejudice to^(previous Reference:j Cabinet 58 (33) any conclusion -lC0nCl^iOn That the Prime Minister should considerthe setting up of a Cabinet Committee,ill. with appropriate Terms of Reference,to report to the Cabinet.
REDUCTION ANDILIMITATION OFARMAMENTS.(previous reference:Cabinet 58(33), Con-elusion 2 .)3. The Cabinet had before them a &quot;Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C.P.-253(33)) containing a brief report of Disarmamentdevelopments during the past week and advancinga number of propositions for the consideration ofhis colleagues.   At the end of the Memorandum itwas stated that the outline of a plan for a modified Convention had been worked out in theForeign Office, which could be circulated.    Ifsomething on these lines commended itself to theCabinet it would be necessary to approach theFrench and Italian Governments.   The French wouldnot altogether like it, but would prefer it,presumably, to no Convention at all.   The Italiansmight approve the new proposal, and might beexpected to communicate it to the Germans. It wasimpossible, however, to calculate what the german attitude would be.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs emphasised the objections to the formulation of-an amended Convention which merely incorporatedthe modifications suggested at the Bureau of theDisarmament Conference on October 14th, sinceGermany had publicly repudiated these proposals and was bovind to reject them when they wereincorporated in a new draft Convention.   He had tosee Mr Arthur Henderson, the President of theConference,  on Monday afternoon, and he asked forthe authority of the Cabinet to take this line with Mr Henderson and to suggest that  it would bedesirable to consult the French and italian governments with a view to the formulation of some new line of approach.
In the course of the discussion some hesitationwas revealed as to whether it was desirable forthis country again to take the lead with new pro-posals, and a wish was expressed that, before adecision was taken, the Cabinet might see what theproposals were.The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs undertook to circulate tothe Cabinet the     paper     he hadforwarded to the Defence be part-ments, and the Cabinet agreed thatthe subject should be considered attheir next Meeting, i.e., on Monday next, November 6th.
GERMANY. 4,    The Prime Minister, in the course of the ambassador&apos;s discussion referred to in the preceding Conclusion,Desire tosee the Prime mentioned that he had just received a request fromMinister,the German Ambassador to see him personally.The Lord President of the Council said that hehad received a similar approach from the german ambassador,The Prime Minister said that this was a matter on which he would be guided by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs.    Re himself felt thatat a time like the present, when the German Govern-ment had created a difficult situation by their action,  it would be inappropriate that he or theLord President should see the German Ambassadorunless the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsfelt that there would be some definite advantage in such an interview.    Otherwise the communication should be made through the normal channel.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs agreed with the Prime Minister.&apos;
THE locarno treaty.(previous reference:Cabinet 54(33), Con-^conclusion ion 1.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs raised, as a matter of urgency, the question of theterms in which he should refer to the Treaty of locarno in the forthcoming Debate on Disarmamenton Tuesday, November 7th.    He read to the cabinet a draft passage dealing with the obligations ofthis country if Germany, two years hence, carriedout the intention (of which she had given notice)to leave the League of Nations,   He had referred the question for an Opinion from the Law Officersof the Crown, but had not yet received their reply.He had tried also to ascertain the views ofSir Austen Chamberlain on the subject, but owingto the attendance of the latter at important meet-ings of the Select Committee on the Indian white paper he had not yet been able to arrange a meeting.He pointed out that the opinion of the ItalianGovernment would have to be obtained, as their position was exactly similar to our own as guarantorsof the Locarno Treaty.As the discussion revealed that grave issues were raised which could not be decided until theviews of the Law Officers of the Crown and ofSir Austen Chamberlain were available, the cabinet agreed  That the question should be placedfirst on the Agenda Paper of their next Meeting on Monday next,November 6th.(The President of the Board of Educationleft during the discussion of the abovesubject.)
6. The Chancellor o-f the Exchequer stated thathe had given instructions to Sir Frederick Leith-Ross in accordance with the Conclusions of theCabinet mentioned in the margin.    He then readextracts from telegrams from Sir Frederick Leith-Ross containing an account of his interview withthe President of the United States, together withhis comments and. suggestions.   From these telegramsit transpired that in the President&apos;s view the gap between the offer which the United Kingdom Govern-ment was prepared to make for a permanent settlement and what the President felt he could recommend to congress was too great for agreement to be reached.The President also was unable to recommend to congress Sir Frederick Leith-Ross&apos;s proposals fora temporary settlement.   President Roosevelt had himself suggested to fall back on the procedure adopted last June, when we made a token payment,although he wished to avoid the word &quot;token&quot;, andwas    unable     to recommend to Congress .the accept-ance of part-payment in silver.    In these circum-stances, the Chancellor of the Exchequer explained,there were three possible courses:-(l) To accept President Roosevelt&apos;sproposals, in the hope that afurther delay would bring abouta better atmosphere for arriving at a permanent settlement:(2) To offer some smaller figure fora temporary payment, namely,7% million Dollars instead of10 million Dollars:(3) To refuse President Roosevelt&apos;soffer, making it clear that wehad desired a permanent settlement,and as our offers had been rejectedwe could not undertake to make further temporary payments.
The only reason given in favour of the second course, apart from, the small reduction in payment,was that it would tend to avoid stereotypingpayments at a fixed figure. The Cabinet, however,rejected the proposal, on the ground that it was hardly worth while to haggle over such a relatively small matter.The third course was opposed by the Chancellorof the Fxehequer himself, who hoped that in thelong run it might be possible to obtain a cancel-lation of the debt.    To refuse payment, however,would wreck all hope of this.    On the whole,therefore, he recommended the first course.The first  course was felt by some members ofthe Cabinet to be extremely unsatisfactory, moreespecially because in all probability circumstances would nbt be more favourable than now for apermanent, settlement before the question of anotherhalf-yearly payment became due, and that situation might continue for years .    On the whole, however,this course was felt to be the one open to theleast objection, and the Cabinet agreed  To authorise the Chancellor of theExchequer to instruct the Pritishnegotiators in Washington to agreeto the proposal to make a paymentof 10 million Dollars in December,which would virtually be a &quot;token&quot;payment, even if that term was not used.f^he Prime Minister appealed, to his colleagues to use, the utmost care to avoid any leakage of this, decision before the moment arrivedfor a public announcement.)
MS UNEMPLOYMENT 7. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informedPILL,  1933.the Cabinet that the Cabinet Committee had now[(previous agreed on all the points in the Bill.      A certain&apos; Reference:Cabinet 56 (33)    number of alterations had been made among whichConclusion l).he mentioned in particular the raising of thehR./ , % maximum figure for the duration of benefit from47g weeks to 52 weeks.The Secretary of State for War informed the Cabinet that the Bill would involve an increase on the estimates of the Defence Departments of 250,000 a year.It was pointed out that Clause 20 ofthe revised Bill providing that the UnemploymentInsurance Statutory Committee should prepare ascheme for the inclusion of persons employed inagriculture in unemployment insurance, involved an important decision of principle which had not as yet been approved by the Cabinet.The Cabinet felt that in so importanta matter Ministers ought to have an opportunityto peruse the Bill before finally approving itand agreed -That the revised Bill should be :circulated to members of the cabinet as soon as possible and not later than Saturday, 4th November;That the subject should be placed on theAgenda Paper for the meeting on Monday,6th November;    andThat the Chancellor of the exchequer should then draw their attention tothe more important changes made by theCommittee.
THE empire marketing BOARD.The Future ofPoster Frames.The Four TradeSub-Committees.^previous reference:Cabinet 55 (33)Conclusion 6.)8. The Secretary of State for the colonies informed the Cabinet that Mr.  Bruce,  the HighCommissioner for Australia, had called on himon the subject of the Cabinet&apos;s decision onPoster Frames and the abolition of the Trade Sub-Committees, and had asked if the decision couldbe reconsidered.        He had intimated that theAustralian Government might like to use thePoster Frames and that they might be willing tomake a contribution towards the maintenance ofthe Trade Sub-Committees.      On the question ofPoster Frames, the Secretary of State for theColonies had said that Mr. Bruce could place himself in communication with Local Authoritiesthrough the Ministry of Health.      He wished toknow, however, what answer he should give to Mr.Bruce about the Trade Sub-Committees.      Mr. Brucehad thought that not only Australia but alsoNew Zealand might be willing to contribute to their maintenance, and had offered to discussthe matter with his fellow High Commissionerswith a view to possible recommendations to theirrespective Governments.The Cabinet agreed -To adhere to their previous decision at the meeting mentioned in the margin and authorised the Secretaryof State for the Colonies to inform mr. Bruce that it was too late to change the policy.
THE RUSSIAN 9.      The attention of the Cabinet was calledTIMBER TRADE.... to allegations that had been made in the Press(Previous to the effect that   a   Canadian government reference:Cabinet 45 (33)    Memorandum on the Russian timber trade had beenConclusion 4).communicated to the Soviet Delegation withoutf.R.lt(31j)XI, the authority of the Canadian Government.The President of the Board of trade informed the Cabinet that there had been a mis-understanding.      The Chief Industrial adviser to His Majesty&apos;s Government had obtained the consent of the Canadian Government to the communication of the Memorandum and the CanadianHigh Commissioner had withdrawn his statement.
COMMERCIALNEGOTIATIONSWImH FOREIGNCOUNTRIES .l) French Dis-criminatoryMeasures.(previous reference:Cabinet 48(35), Con-clusion 9.)2) THE TARIFFTRUC E .Question &quot;of withdrawl,(previous reference:Cabinet 47(33), Con-clusion 5.)10.   mhe Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe President of the Board of Trade (C.F.-248 (33))on the subject of French discriminatory measures against British trade, relating especially to thesurtax of 15 per cent. ad. valorem, and the &quot;ImportTurnover Tax&quot;.   These two discriminatory dutiesresulted in adding about 20 per cent, to the duties on nearly half the British goods sent  to France,and in many cases the doubling,  or more than doubling,of the normal duty, with a consequent heavy reductionin British exports .   To meet this situation thePresident of the Board of Trade asked his colleagues to agree -(a) That if, after a final warning, theFrench do not completely remove thetwo discriminatory taxes, we shouldimpose a duty, as nearly as possibleequivalent, on a selected range ofFrench goods, making the limitednature of our object clear from thes tart:(b) That we should at once give the bureau of the Monetary and Economic Confer-ence a. month&apos;s notice of the reserva-tion of the Tariff Truce in respectof measures which we may find, itnecessary to take to counteractdiscriminations practised or cont.em-plated by other countries against our trade:(c) That at the same time we should informthe French Government that we cannotregard, ourselves as bound any longerby the I a us a nne Declaration so far as concerns action necessary to counteractboth the forms of discrimination theyare at present practising against us.The Cabinet also had under consideration a laterMemorandum by the President of the Board of Trade(C.P.-251 (33)) recommending withdrawal from theTariff ^ruce,    in view of reservations made by france and other countries, and the formal withdrawalof the Netherlands, Sweden and the Irish Free State.
The Prime Minister asked the President of theBoard of Trade to keep the Cabinet informed of theposition and to notify them before he took actiona,on Conclusion O) of CP.-248 (33).The Cabinet agreed -To approve the proposals of the Presidentof the Board of Trade in CP. 248 (33)and CP.  251 (53) as summarised above.

He accordingly asked his colleagues&apos;approval o^ this course.The Cabinet agreed -To approve the proposals of theSecretary of State for the colonies as set forth in CP.  234 (33)summarised above.
