-RKuocrrcN&apos; /jwLIMITATION of armaments.The new draftPlan.(previous reference:Cabinet 60(33), Con-clusion 3.)fl.1,  In accordance with the decision at theMeeting mentioned in the margin, the Cabinet had.before them the draft conclusions reached by the ministerial Committee on Disarmament on the subjectof procedure at Geneva (C.P.-261 (33))  (Appendix).In the course of the discussion attention was drawn to telegrams from Sir Eric Drummond, HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Rome (Nos.317 and 319)reporting that S. Mussolini and the Italian Govern-ment were opposed to proceeding with a convention and would prefer to wait for a little time and thenendeavour to resume a conversation with Germanyincluded.    This corresponded generally with theConclusions of fhe Ministerial Committee.   Thesuggestion was made that the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs might with advantage take steps toascertain whether the Italian Delegation would take this line at Geneva, and. to suggest to the FrenchGovernment that they should ascertain whetherDr Benes, the Rapporteur of the Bureau, would takea similar line.The discussion by the Cabinet was mainly confined to the point as to whether the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs and the parliamentary under-Secretary of State should proceed to Geneva,visiting Paris on their way.The Cabinet agreed --&apos;y(a) That as information had now beenreceived that both the French and,the Italian Governments would berepresented at the forthcoming meeting of the Bureau of theDisarmament Conference at Genevaby Officials, it would be inappropriate-priate and inconvenient that the secretary of State for ForeignAffairs or the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of state should representthe United Kingdom Delegation:(b) That a visit/by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, excepten route to Geneva, would not be
advisable at the present moment, as itwould tend to arouse undue expectationsboth in this country and abroad:(c) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should send a message to theBritish Ambassador in Paris calling his attention to the latest information fromRome, as set forth above, adding that he himself had decided not to attend themeeting of the Bureau on Friday:    butthat he expected to visit Geneva next week and would be glad of an opportunityto discuss future progress  on Disarmamentwith M. Sarraut and M, Paul-Bone our whenpassing through Paris;(d) That the British Ambassador in Parisshould also be asked to notify Mr arthur henderson, who was in Paris, that theSecretary of State had heard that theFrench and Italian delegations would both be represented at the forthcoming meeting of the Bureau only by Officials;that he had a number of important engage-ments in London during the latter halfof this week, including a speech at theLord Mayor&apos;s Banquet and. the Ceremonyat the Cenotaph on Armistice, Bay, when a full complement of Ministers was usuallypresent:    and. that, in the circumstances,he felt that, he would not be justified inabsenting himself from London.    He should add.., however, that he was expecting toproceed to Geneva in the following week:e) That Rome should also be notified of thechange of plan:f) That the United Fingdom Delegation shouldbe represented at the Bureau of the Disarm-ament Conference by *.rr Cadogan, of theForeign Office.(At this point the Secretary, of Statewithdrew for some time.)
COMMITTEE OP 2.   The Cabinet agreed  IMPERIALDEFENCE. &apos; That, in view of the previous decision,the Meeting of the Committee of ImperialDefence on the following morning,Thursday, November 9th, which had hadto be postponed owing to the probableabsence of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, should no,,r be held.
INDIA.joint SelectCommittee onthe indian constitution.(previous reference:Cabinet 55(33), Oon-clusion 2(b) and (c).)5. The Secretary of State for India recalled that at the Meeting of the Cabinet referred to inthe margin he had intimated that it might be unavoidable-able for him to ask for an interruption in the debate on the Address on the re-assembly of Parliament, forthe purpose of re-setting up the India Select Commit-tee, and that he had been asked, in consultationwith the Leader of the House of Lords, to considerwhether it was possible to speed up the procedure.Owing to the arrival of the representatives of burma the India Select Committee found, it imperativeto meet a week earlier than they had previouslycontemplated.   He had discussed the matter with theWhips of the three Parties, who were willing thatthe Motion for the Select Committee should be taken on the second day of the Session, that is to say,Wednesday, November 22nd,    He had been assured thatthe Motion ought not to occasion any difficulty inthe House of Lords, and he had hopes that it wouldnot require much time in the House of Commons .The Cabinet agreed  That the Debate on the Address shouldbe interrupted in order to provide forthe re-setting up of the India SelectCommittee on Wednesday, November S2nd.
SAVAL CON-gTRU0TION .Alterationto 1933programme .(previous reference r60 (33), Comelusion 4.)FA4.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe First Lord of the Admiralty (CP.-247 (33))recalling that, in approving the proposed alteration in the Programme of Naval Construction at the meeting mentioned in the margin, it was agreed that he shouldMl) enquire as to how long the announcement of thechange could be delayed from the purely technical point of view&quot;, and (2)  &quot;consult the Cabinet as tothe date on which Parliament should be informed ofthis decision&quot;.    As regards  (l) the First Lord was of opinion that,  for reasons given in the Memorandum,invitations to tender could not be held up any later than November 15th without danger of questions beingashed as to modification of the original Programme.As regards (2) the First Lord recommended that Parlia-ment should be informed of the change not later thanNovember 15th.While the need for the ships included in theAdmiralty&apos;s programme was not criticised, misgivingswere expressed as to probable political difficulties.Criticisms v/ere likely to be made not only by the advocates of uni-lateral disarmament by this.country,but also on the ground that the new 6-inch gun Cruiser,though coming technically inside the London naval treaty, upset the spirit of the Treaty by compellingus to reduce the number of Cruisers from 50 to 49.The Cabinet were reminded, however, that the admiralty had been forced reluctantly to this proposal by theaction of other countries.Reference was made to the assistance which thenaval orders would, give to employment, more particu-larly as certain of the most distressed areas werein places where shipbuilding was an important industry.
The Cabinet agreedTo approve the proposal of theFirst Lord of the Admiralty thatinvitations to tender for the new-ships could not be held up anylater than November 15th, and that parliament should be informed ofthe change not later than that date.
B IRISH FREEpreviousReference:Cabinet 655), Con-elusion 2.)f.R. IT5. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (CP.-258(33)) giving an account of recent developments inthe Irish Free State, as exemplified by three Billsrecently introduced by Mr de Valera for the amendmentof the Irish Free State Constitution.    It was clearthat the intention and real significance of the Billswas to make the KingTs Representative, as far aspossible, a nonentity, and to assimilate the formof government, little by little, to a republic.In these circumstances the Secretary of state proposed that the British position should be made clear by the issue of a statement in terms suggestedin his Memorandum.The proposed declaration by the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs,, set forth in paragraphs11 and 12 of CP.-258 (33), was discussed mainly from the point of view o^ its possible effect on other Dominions .Some discussion took place also as to the positionof nationals of the Irish Free State in this country who are in receipt of benefit, or transitional benefit, or public assistance, whether at the presenttime or if and when the ultimate aims of Mr de Valeraare realised.The Cabinet were informed that both the canadian and Australian Governments possessed legislative powers under which they could send back to thiscountry nationals of the United Kingdom applying for public relief.   The Cabinet wer^ also informed thatin this country applicants for relief whose domicileis in Northern Ireland or, indeed, in any Parishin the United Kingdom, could be returned to theirdomiciles% but that this did not apply to personsdomiciled in the Irish Free State. -
It was suggested also that there was probably a certain amount of &quot;faking&quot; of Insurance Cards byImmigrants from the Irish Free State, and thatenquiry on the subject might with advantage be made.The President of the Board of Trade reminded theCabinet of the serious effect of the continuance oftrade restrictions on trade generally, and on thecoal trade in particular.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the statement of theSecretary of State for DominionAffairs, as set forth in Paragraphs11 and 12 of CP.-258 (33), subjectto the following amendment:-For the words &quot;That is an idea towhich TTis Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom will in^no circumstances agree&quot;,      ^H^JJ- tb^-fu^   \put&quot;Any such ,propose.Is would betotally Unacceptable to HisMajesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom&quot;:(b) That the Home Secretary, the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs, theSecretary of State for Scotland, theMinister of Health and the Ministerof Labour, should jointly prepare and circulate to the Cabinet a Memorandumon the position of citizens of (a)  theIrish Free State, (b) other Dominions,in receipt of benefit, or transitional benefit, or public assistance in thiscountry;    the law relating to them:their numbers and cost:    and generally on the competition of Irish Free Statecitizens in the labour market in GreatBritain, and on their chargeability t.opublic funds in Great Britain.    f
ESTIMATES OPffjF FIGHTINGSERVICES.future of. theHome defence scheme.Royal Air ForceProgramme for1934.(previous reference:Cabinet 52(29), Con-clusion 3.)ah.-6. The Cabinet had before them a taemoranfl-um &quot;bythe Secretary of State for Air (C.P.-245 (33)) onthe subject of the future of the Home Defence Schemeand the Royal Air Force programme for 1934.   Inview of the preparation of the Air Estimates for1934 the Secretary Of State requested early diree-tions on certain iriatters of policy, and asked the-Cabinet, for the reasons advanced in his Memorandum -(l) To authorise the formation in 1934of two new Home Defence Squadronsand the conversion to a normal basisof the two &quot;paper&quot; squadrons atpresent incorporated in one of otirtechnical establishments:(2) To reaffirm the Fome,Defence Schemeof 1923, the date of its completionto 52 squadrons being, however,deferred from 1938 to 1940:   ,(3) To authorise the formation of one new flying boat squadron in 1934.In the course of the discussion the attentionof the Cabinet was drawn to the great success that had been achieved by the Auxiliary Squadrons.The Secretary of State for Air informed, hiscolleagues that the Air Ministry fully realisedtheir efficiency, but pointed out that they couldnot be sent abroad, and that in the case of so smallan Air Force Reserve Squadrons were, for technical reasons, mor-e valuable.mhe Chancellor of the Exchequer reported thaton the financial side he would not oppose theproposals of the Secretary of State for Air.   Itmight be argued that, as the Home Defence Air force was required mainly for defence against attack by france, this form of defensive preparation might reasonably be excluded at the present time and that other defence requirements were more urgent.    If&quot; theamount of money involved had been considerablehe would have pressed this point of view, but in existing circumstances he would not.   there remainedalso the political considerations.-9-
The Secretary of State for War, while notoffering any opposition to the proposals of theSecretary of State for Air, suggested that as he also would have to apply to the Chancellor of theFxchequer for an increase in Estimates to make up some small part of the deficiencies in military equipment resulting from the long application ofthe men Years Rule, it might perhaps be better    ifthe Chancellor of the Exchequer had before him therequirements of the Services as a whole before anyparticular demand was approved.The Secretary of State for Air, while notopposing this course, pointed out that he was merelyasking for a resumption of a programme approved tenyears ago, which had been allowed to fall dangerouslybehindhand, and that he would feel bound to presshis proposals when the time came.The Cabinet agreed  To postpone a decision as to theproposals of the Secretary of Statefor Air, as set forth in CP.-245 (3?),until the Chancellor of the exchequer had received the Estimates of the &quot;three services and could submit a compre-hensive programme of their requirements.(The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs returned at this point.)
qm, DUNSTAN&apos;S,jtfGENT&apos;S PARK.proposedgxtens ion0f Leas e.ROYAL PARKS .Abolition ofprivateEnclosures .(previous reference:Cabinet SO(28), Con-elusion 12.)7. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (C.P.-256(33)) on the subject of St. Dunstan&apos;s, RegenfsPark, the lease of which had recently been purchased by Lord Rothermere.   The latter proposedto demolish the existing out-of-date and dilapidated,house, to build a new house at an estimated costof  60,000, and to spend a large additional sumon the garden.    In consideration of this proposedoutlay on the improvement of the property LordRothermere asked for an extension of the lease.After setting forth points for the considerationof his colleagues, the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries asked authority to negotiate with LordRothermere for the grant of a lease for not morethan eighty years, subject to the condition thatthe latter should forthwith relinquish not lessthan three acres of the grounds, to be added toRegenfs Park and made available for the publicuse.    Pie felt that such an arrangement would bemore in accordance with the policy expressed by tieCabinet at their Meeting mentioned in the margin,than to refuse to extend the lease.The First Commissioner of Works felt certainobjections to the proposals of the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries ,   He pointed out thatthey were not in harmony with the Cabinet decisionon May 23, 1928, viz,:-&quot;That the general policy should be to aim at gradually bringing to an end the enclosures in the Public Parks,and that the First Commissioner ofWorks should take steps necessary, asleases fall in, to Give effect to thispolicy, in consultation with the other,Government Departments concerned&quot;.His own predecessor in office, who wraa now leader of the Opposition, was well aware of the position,
for recreation in London.   For such purposes theproposals of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisherieswould not be of much value, since the three acresthat it was proposed to recover were unsuitable forthe purpose,    ^he proposal to extend Lord Rothermere&apos;slease would also have a bearing on other leases asthey fell in.The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed theCabinet, however, that the present Leader of theOpposition, when he was First Commissioner of.Works,had sanctioned the extension of a lease in conditionswhich were very similar to those now contemplated.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To adhere to the following decisionof May S3, 1928, as the guiding principle:-&quot;That the general policy should be to aim at gradually bringing to an end the enclosures in the Public Parks,and that the First Commissioner ofWorks should take steps necessary, asleases fall in, to give effect to thispolicy,  in consultation with the other government Departments concerned&quot;:(b) ^o approve the proposals of the Ministerof Agriculture and. Fisheries, as set forth in C.P.-256 (33), subject to an instruc-tion to him to obtain the relinquishmentby Lord Rothermere of as large an area aspossible to be added to Regent&apos;s Park and made available for the public use.

In the circumstances he proposed an immediate Meeting of the Middle EastMinisterial Committee to consider and advise theCabinet as to whether their previous decision shouldbe varied.The Cabinet agreed  That the Ministerial Committee on theMiddle East should meet for-the abovepurpose,
ECONOMICADVISORYCOUNCIL.Ninth Report-of Committeeon economic information.(previous reference:Cabinet 46(S3), Con-clusion 12.)3(34)53.10. The Cabinet took note of the Ninth Reportof the Committee on Economic Information   of theEconomic Advisory Council fC .P.-254 (33)),, whichhad been circulated for the information of theCabinet on the instructions of the Prime Minister.The Chancellor of the Exchequer invited, theattention of the Cabinet to the following statement in Paragraph 18 of the Report:-&quot;Up to May, therefore, it may beassumed that not less than  35,000,000of gold at current market price, or 25,000,000 at par, which was being held by the Exchange EqualizationFund at the beginning of the year,was transferred to the Bank duringthe months in question&quot;.He wished, the Cabinet to know that this v/as aguess and nowhere near the truth.   He added that part- IT -of the Report, dealing with the economicoutlook, was well worth study.The Prime Minister said .he would invite theCommittee not to indulge in speculations such asthat referred to by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.,The President of the Board of Trade quoted thelast three lines of the Report, as follows:-&quot;Subject to contingencies of this character, however, the economicoutlook for Great Britain seemsto us more hopeful than it has been at any time since the depressionbegan&quot;,This, he said, accorded, &quot;with the views of theBoard of Trade, which were based on differentconsider-ations .

PROCEDURE AT GENEVA.(a) that it is undesirable to attempt to negotiatedetails of a Draft Disarmament Conventionuntil the ground has been prepared by con-versations between the principal Powers concernedincluding Germany.    It is essential to avoid the risk either of confronting Germany with conditions which she may reject or emphasisingpublicly disagreement between the other Powers.(b) that, as a corollary to (a) above, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should not, at this stage, putforward the draft plan for a modified disarmament convention proposed by the Foreign Office(CP,  255(33));    and they should endeavour toget the discussion at, the Bureau on November 9thof Mr. Henderson&apos;s modified draft of His Majesty&apos;Government^ Convention of March 16th, 1933,postponed.(c) that, as regards procedure,  the first step should be to consult the French and italian governments with a view to getting their support for the proposed adjournment of the bureau:    it is most important that france should be approached first since she isbelieved to be the strongest advocate of continuing discussions at the Bureau.The next stage, if the above conversationsare satisfactory, will be to approach thePresident of the Disarmament Conference.(d) that the reasons for desiring a postponement of the proposed discussion at the Bureauwill require very careful consideration.The following points were suggested forthe guidance of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;representatives:-(i) a new factor seems to have arisen in the offer made by   Baron vonNeurath in his speech on November6th as reported in &quot;The Times&quot;.(ii) the disarmament proposals which mr. Henderson wishes to bring forward will almost certainly be unacceptable to Germany since they contain the modifications to our Draft Convention v/hichcaused her withdrawal from theConference.(iii) It is better to recognise thatGermany&apos;s withdrawal has caused a new situation which, in all probability can best be handled,CABINET.DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE, 1932.DRAFT CONCLUSIONS of Ministerial Committee,reached at a Meeting held on Tuesday,November 7th, 1933, at 11.0 a.m.
in the first instance, by exploratory conversations between the principalPowers concerned, including Germany.(e) that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs accompanied by Mr. Eden shouldrepresent us at Geneva and should endeavourto meet M,  Sarraut on his way.    In themeantime information should at once besent to the British Ambassador in Parisso that he may prepare the ground.(f) that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be authorised to takeextremely tentative soundings as to thepossibility of a meeting of Heads of governments at some stage, possibly inLondon.      It being clearly understood,however,  that before any such meetingcould be given concrete consideration,its objects must be clearly defined anda plan prepared which would have definiteprospects of success.DEBATE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS.(g) that with a view to preparing the ground for our proposals at the Bureau, theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs should refer in his speech to the offerreported to have been made by Baron vonNeurath (Vide  (d)(i) above.)Whitehall Gardens,S.W.I.7th November, 1933.
