X, ^he Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe First Lord of the Admiralty (C.P,-833 (.33))proposing alterations to the programme of new construction, 1933, so as to include two new cruisers of 8,900 tons displacement and one ARETKUSA typeCruiser instead of one LEANDER type and threeARETEUSA type Cruisers,  as previously approved.This would   mean a reduction in expenditure of 300,000 up to the end of 1935.After consideration of the question in its naval,international and political aspects, the cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the proposed alteration in the Programme of Naval Cons true-t-ion as set forth in C.P.-233 (33)and briefly summarised above:(b) To invite the First Lord of theAdmiralty to enquire as to how longthe announcement of the change couldbe delayed from the purely technical point of view,  and to consult theCabinet as to the date on which parliament should be informed ofthis decision.
;     JAPAN. 2. In the course of the discussion referred toRelations with, in the preceding Conclusion the Chancellor of theExchequer drew attention to the extent to which Naval(previous reference:        limitation of armaments was hampered by the situationCabinet 38(3o), Con-       in the Par East.    Fie pointed out that not only waselusion 6.)the decision recorded in the previous Conclusionaffected thereby, but also that the gravity of thesituation ^as emphasised in the Annual Review of theChiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 1113-B).He greatly regretted the weakening of Anglo-japanese relations which had resulted from the termination ofthe Alliance at the Washington Conference in 1921-22.In the long run we had. received no adequate compensa-tion, and our position in the Par East had only been rendered more precarious.    If only we could be free from all apprehension as to a conflict with Japanthe situation would be greatly eased.   He asked theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs to considerwhether anything could be done to improve relationswith Japan.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointedout that the question was a large one.    It was perfectlytrue that Japanese feeling had been stirred tip by our attitude almost to one of resentment against us.So far, however, in the political field we had maintained fairly good relations.   Japan did notforget that in the Manchurian episode we had steereda middle course.   He thanked the Chancellor of theExchequer for his suggestion, and promised that thematter would be considered.The President of the Board of Trade informed theCabinet that, so far as he was aware, there were twocurrents  of opinion in Japan:    one purely militaristic,the other aggressively commercial.    At the presenttime the former w*as   in the ascendant.    It was somewhat
litalarming to notice the way in which Japanese industry-had &quot;been worked to our detriment.    For example,before going off the Gold Standard, the Japanese hadbuilt up huge stocks, and that position had been usedto damage us .   They had invaded the Indian and African colonial markets, and were severe competitorsof ours in South America,    The conversations at Simlaf.R.       were going rather better than he had hoped for,  and&apos;     it might be possible to arrange some allocation of markets.    If agreement on those lines could beextended to China it would be very advantageous, buthe was  dubious  on that point.   -&amp;s soon as he receiveddefinite information from Simla he proposed to informthe Cabinet.The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointedAfricanout that, although the colonial/markets were notperhaps the most important, it was rather difficultnot to take action there, in view of the feeling thatexisted.The Prime Minister agreed that the situationvis-a-vis Japan was bad, both from the political and commercial points of view.   The Japanese might be grateful for our attitude at Geneva, but this  didnot strike very deep.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs addedthat the Japanese attitude had an important bearing on Disarmament.    It was doubtful whether they wouldever agree to a Disarmament Convention.    mhey had not.withdrawn from the Disarmament Conference, but were holding aloof.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that Navalinformation was to the effect that the Japanese,although acting hitherto within the Naval Treaties,would take the first  opportunity that offered tobreak away from them.

Some discussion then took place on the political aspects       these matters ,    On- the one   hand,, theMinisters at the head of the Defence Services wereexposed to strong pressure to increase our armaments,and,  on the other, there was reported to be a strong feeling in the country against any increase in armamentsThe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed out,however, that at any rate we had kept well inside theNaval Treaties,    He undertook to give considerationto the suggestion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave theCabinet a full appreciation of the financial positionin the United States of America and. of its possible reactions on this country.    He added some briefcomments on the possible effects on Prance andother countries still on the Gold Standard.   Whilethe future was full of uncertainties, he did not,at the moment, see any reason to take too anxious aview of the situation.The President of the Board of Trade added a fewremarks as to the views of a number of representativebusiness men whom he had met the same morning.    InChina the effects of American competition on our trade were almost negligible, but in South Americaand South Africa competition had grown up in certain articles ,    The United States were purchasing largequantities of certain commodities, particularlyleather and tin.(On the conclusion of this discussion the Cabinet passed to the question ofthe Anglo-American Debt Negotiations.The discussion on this subject was adjourned at 1 p.m. and resumed at afresh Meeting at 3 p.m.    The conclusions are contained in the record of thelatter Meet ing .)M 2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1,October 26,  1933.
