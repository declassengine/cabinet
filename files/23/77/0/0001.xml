AUSTRO-GERMAN        1.   The Cabinet had under consideration a Note &quot;by theRELATIONS.Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. 212(33)),(previous reference: covering a Memorandum by Sir Robert Vansittart on theCabinet 48(.33) , Con- present and future position in Europe.      In thiselusion 4).Memorandum the Permanent Under-Secretary of State reviewed in detail the dangerous tendencies and possiblere-actions of Herr Hitler&apos;s policy, emphasising theimmediate threat to the independence of Austria where,allas he put it, &quot;We are/backing a losing horse&quot;.     he described five different ways in which Germany couldpersevere in her policy of destroying Austria bycausing the fall of the present Government and thesubstitution of a Nazi regime.     These included thepossibility of a &quot;Putsch&quot; across the Austrian borderat an early date,     rumours of which were circulating.He emphasised the importance of the time factor, asDr. Dollfuss estimated that if he could survive thewinter the Nazis in Germany would be discredited by thefall in trade and rise in unemployment.      In discussingin detail the attitude of the principal Powers Sir R.Vansittart laid stress both on the danger that Germanymay succeed in detaching Italy from her former Alliesand on the vital importance of securing Anglo-French-Italian co-operation.      In discussing the question of whether or not this grave question ought to be allowedto come before the League of Nations he presented asome of themnumber of weighty considerations/affecting the futureof the League itself.     He pointed out that referenceto the League might lead at least to the application ofeconomic pressure on Germany, and he appended aMemorandum on the legal and practical difficulties ofsuch a course, quoting extensively from a draft report under consideration by the Sub-Committee of the
Committee of Imperial Defence.     As regards our immediatepolicy   in the present phase of the Austrian question,Sir Robert Vansittart suggested that we should at leasthe on safe ground if we continued to combine the narrowerpolic3&apos;- of holding Italy to her self-imposed task of keeping Herr Hitler under control   with the wider policyof promoting Franco-Italian conciliation as a preliminary to that Anglo-French-Italian co-operation which was likely to he the only real bulwark of peace until Germanyceased to challenge the existing political status quoin Europe.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had beeninterested in an account that Sir Maurice Hankey had given him of a motoring holiday in Western Germany.Although it was unusual he thought the Cabinet might be interested if the Secretary would, tell them something of his experiences.SIR MAURICE HANKEY; who explained that he hadtravelled in Germany merely as a tourist and hadwitnessed conditions there from the point of view of amember of the general public, then gave his impressions.(An account of Sir Maurice HankeyTs experiences is on record in the Cabinet Office and is available to anymember of the Cabinet who might wish to see it.)The Cabinet then discussed the memorandum circulated by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the first draftof this Memorandum had reached him before the return of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs fromhis holiday.      He had felt that the issues raisedwere very grave and that it would be an advantage forthe Cabinet to have at least a preliminary exchangeof views thereon.
rTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSshared the Prime Minister&apos;s view as to the  importanceof Sir Robert VansittartTs Memorandum.      Since his return he had obtained the latest information en.  the question of the German attitude towards Austria.The latest information seemed to show that the dangerof a &quot;Putsch&quot; from Bavaria inte Austria had ratherreceded.      It had been so much advertised that herr HitlerTs advisers were believed to think itinadvisable.      They appeared to think now that theyhad only to wait for the Austrian plum to fall into their hands.    Originally the conoentration of Austriansin Bavaria had been rather near the frontier.According to the latest information the concentrationhad. now been moved further back into Germany.    Neitherthe Italians nor Dr.Dollfuss thought  it was likely toeventuate.      Nevertheless, the possibility of a &quot;Putsch&quot;later on ought not to be overlooked.      The question he wished the Cabinet to consider was whether this question should be brought up under the Four Power Pact or underArticle XI (Paragraph 2)   of the Covenant  of the Leaguewouldof Nations.    S.Mussolini/prefer.      the former courseas he was the author of the Pact.     A dangerous featurein the situation was that Italy &quot;was so situated thatshe might gain advantages from a German success un austria.    A serious factor was that in the recentinterview between Dr.Dollfuss and S.Mussolini the formerhad expressed a readiness,  in certain eventualities,to admit Italians to Austria, which opened upuncomfortable possibilities.      The alternative was tobring the matter up under Paragraph 2 of Article XIof the Covenant.      The advantage of this method was that
the League was an organised international machinewhereas the Four Power Pact had no machinery.There was moreover, a technical argument, perhaps not very well founded,  used by the French, thatthis particular question did not fall within theterms of the Pact.THE PRIME MINISTER said that when the mattercame to his notice a fortnight or so ago the ForeignOffice held that the matter was a very urgent one and they thought the Cabinet ought to be summonedat an early date to decide as to whether action should be taken under the Four Power Pact or theCovenant.      At that time, however, the Foreign office had taken a far more serious view of the rumoured&quot;Putsch&quot; than at present.     Whether the Four Power Pactor the Covenant of the League was resorted to,everything depended on the attitude of Italy.    In a four Power Conference the United Kingdom, France andItaly could give advice if they agreed.    A Four power meeting, however, with Italy secretly hacking germany would be most embarrassing.      If Geneva were resortedto there would he bound to emerge some operativeresolution.      In that event we ought to have our mindsmade up as to how far we were willing to go.    economic sanctions could certainly not be resorted to unlessItaly agreed.    The danger of the situation was, therefore,whichever course were adopted, that Germany and italy might get together on the one side and France and ourselves on the other.      The situation would be at itsworst if the Council of the League -were divided.No-one had yet suggested a middle course.      He himself had warned the Foreign Office against expressing theview that a &quot;Putsch&quot; was probable.      If serious events
happpened, however, they were likely to happensuddenly.    That was S-Mussolini 1s method.      Therewas little doulot that S.Mussolini had the idea of goingdown to history as the founder of a new system inEurope.    It was obvious that the present situationmust offer some temptation to him to get hold of herr Hitler and to do it soon.    That indicated thenature of the problem that had to be faced.arose of. .   The Cabinet&apos;were reminded that if any question/a specific blockade much would turn on the attitudeof the United States.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER thoughtthat of the five alternatives on page 5 of the ForeignOffice Memorandum Germany was most likely to continuepropaganda by broadcasting, together with fermentingsedition and sabotage in Austria.      This would be&apos;supported by economic pressure as opportunity offered.Each separate step might be difficult to bring home to the German Government,  but the cumulative effecton Austria might be very great and (as the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs suggested) the movementin Austria against Dr.Dollfuss would be strengthened.Such an attitude on the part of Germany could onlybe dealt with with the co-operation Of Italy as wellas France.      Italian co-operation he thought was unlikely.      Their attitude was likely to be &quot;Leave itto us.    We will put  in a word with Hitler.&quot;     That hadbeen their attitude hitherto and it had not producedresults.      So far as the League of Nations was concerned.,it must not be overlooked that a section of publicopinion here would be much concerned.
&apos;     9THE SECRETARY OP STATE POP FOREIGN AFFAIRS&quot;agreedthat the question had its internal as well as its externalaspects.      Trade Unionists and Labour organisations werespecially interested.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER thought thelatter organisations would favour League methods.    Thequestion had to be considered, however, as to whethereconomic sanctions would he involved.    He did not believethat America would co-operate with us in economic sanctions.Even the mildest form of such sanctions, namely,  prohibitionof German imports, would have serious financial effectsowing to the large sums due to us by Germany.      He couldnot contemplate action of that kind as practicable.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES emphasised the danger of the economic collapse of Austria, also the disaster that would come upon the League if it failed inthis question.     He expressed doubts&apos; as to the economicsurvival of Austria without a Customs Union.    It was possibleto imagine inflicting serious injury on Germany withoutdoing any good to Austria.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR drew attentionto Sir Robert Vansittartrs suggestion that &quot;We are allbacking a losing horse in Austria&quot;.Some discussion then took place -on the politicalsituation in Austria.      Dr.Dollfuss,  it appeared, was in a precarious position.    Sir Walford Selby had reported inone telegram that seventy per cent, of the country would be against him in the event of a General Election.    As a conservative, he could not afford to invite the support ofthe Socialists, whose inclination was to keep him in power as the best safeguard against German aggression.The question was then discussed briefly as towhether, from the point of view of British interests, a break up of Austria would be a serious event.    The Cabinet
were reminded that a Nazi victory in Austria would resultin an economic rapprochement with Germany.    There wouldthen he a Fascist hand down the centre of Europe composedof Germany, Austria, and Italy.       The French would heseriously upset if the boundaries of the Peace Treatieswere altered.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR had reached theconclusion that it was a British interest to maintain anindependent Austria.    Otherwise, Austria would be divided between Germany and Italy and there would be a continuousFascist block from the North Sea and the Baltic to theMediterranean.       Notwithstanding the danger to italy from a boundary co-terminoue with Germany, this wouldnot be desirable.    He thought also that it was notadvantageous to us to encourage Nazi Germany.   AlreadyGermany was too strong.     They would be encouraged to takethe next step in tearing up the Treaty of Versailles,dealing first with the Corridor as a prelude to otherparts of the Eastern Frontier and then Alsace Lorraineand the Colonies.      He thought Germany*s likely course wasnot to use force, but, as the Chancellor of the exchequer had suggested, to resort to economic measures and propaganda.        In that event how could we help Austria?The best way appeared to be to encourage France and italy to take the Austrian products, e.g. timber, which Germanyrefused to accept.    As regards the method, he preferredresort to the Four Power Pact rather than the League ofNations.    The Pact was S.MussoliniTs creation and he wouldbe flattered by the use of this instrument in preference tothe League.    There would be a better chance of securinghis oo-operation.      In the Four Power Pact also there was less publicity than at Geneva,      It would be easier tonegotiate in conditions of secrecy than where nations had
to take up a point of view from which it was difficultto recede, as at the League.      Moreover,  notwithstanding that the Four Powers would have to meet together, thorewould be opportunities for those informal conversations at which so much of the real work of international conferences was carried out.        Even if the Four Powersdid not reach complete agreement,  it would be difficult for Germany if Italian co-operation with France andGreat Britain was secured.    Further,  if resort weremade to the League of Nations the representatives ofthe Little Entente would be very active and France, inparticular, might be embarrassed.      Consequently, thecourse he advocated was resort to the Four Power pact and, since economic war by Germany on Austria was thegreat danger, he favoured an effort being made to getFrance and Italy to take, the products of Austria.    Hewould like an effort made,  on the one hand to -     curge on France the advantages of placating Italy and,on the other, an attempt to bring home to Italy the dangers of the Anschluss.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS pointedout that,  if it were decided not to resort to the Leagueof Nations, the better course might be to communicateseparately with France and Italy,, rather than to holda meeting of the Four Powers. That had been themethod adopted in the matter of the additional Forcepermitted to Austria,THE PRIME MINISTER said that the discussion had brought out strongly that Italy was the feey to thesituation.      He thought we ought to try first to getarm in arm with S.Mussolini.      He would not. advise any pressure on France to come to terms with Italy at thisstage.      Something might be done in that direction by
diplomacy, &quot;but it should not be pressed too stronglyas yet.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs thought that Germany might have been influenced in her attitude by the fact that the League was meeting in a fortnight&apos;s time.THE PRIME MINISTER thought it important that both the present ambassador, Sir Ronald Graham,and his successor, Sir Eric Drummond, should beinformed of the general attitude of the Cabinet.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs undertook to see to this.The suggestion was made that there mightbe advantages if Sir Ronald Graham (who was reported from many quarters to have established a very strong position with the Italian Government)  could advance the date at which he was to return to Rome to packup, without advancing his final departure.No decisions were asked for or taken, but thegeneral trend of the Cabinet&apos;s view was that, in theevent of the Austro-Gerraan question becoming acute:-(a) Italy was the key to the situation;(b) It should be left to the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs to decide how best to deal with Italy, having regardto the Cabinet discussion.(c) If it were decided that we must take some initiative, we should not bedrawn in the direction of referring thequestion to the League of Nations.(d) That the best method of opening the question might be some communication, possibly an informal one, with Italy, while keeping in touch with France.
REDUCTION and limitation of armaments.The ForthcomingAnglo-french conversations.Proposed Anglo-ItalianConversations.(previous reference:Cabinet 48(33), Conclu-sion 3).r.R.2.     The Cabinet had before them the following documents, circulated by direction of the PrimeMinister, on the question of Reduction and Limitationof Armaments:-A Memorandum by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(CP. 205(33))  on the subject of theforthcoming Anglo-French Conversations,to which was attached a Memorandum byHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Parisdefining the French Government&apos;&apos;s presentposition as regards Disarmament and security.      France had now accepted theBritish Disarmament plan as a basis andwas prepared to accept it altogethersubject to certain amendments, of whichthe most important would relate toSupervision.      The memorandum was more encouraging than that submitted by theFrench Government to Mr. Henderson onJuly 11th last (CP. 185(33)) and appeared to represent the views ofM. Daladier rather than those ofM. Paul-Boneour.      The most that couldbe hoped for was that what now appearedto be M. Daladier&apos;s view would prevail,and that during the Paris Conversationsthe French Government would be able tomake an offe^ which could be regardedas fair and likely to commend itself as such to the Italian and UnitedStates Governments no less than to ourselves:A Memorandum by the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(CP.  204(33))  suggesting that theParliamentary Under-Secretary of state should report to London after his visit to Paris and should then visit Rome, inorder to discuss the situation asrevealed by the Paris visit:    and indicating a line that might be taken with the Italian Government.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs informed the Cabinet that the new factor in thesituation since they had last considered the questionof Disarmament was that it was now clear that theFrench Government was anxious to show itself eager fora Disarmament Convention and there were some indications that France would make a proposal of a
reasonable character.      That proposal was likely toinclude an experimental period of a few years duringwhich the prospects of success in disarmament would be tested, together with some system of supervision.He felt some doubt, however, as to whether Germanyoould accept proposals of that kind in their presentmood.      He was not in favour of the Parliamentary UnderSecretary of State following his visit to Paris by a visit to Rome.     Such a visit would be inconvenienteven from the point of view of the timetable.      Inaccordance with the suggestions of the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, the Cabinet agreed -(a) that the Parliamentary Under Secretaryof State, Foreign Office, should be instructed in his conversations withthe French Government to elicit full details of the French proposals andreport to the Cabinet what were theterms and conditions which the Frenchregarded as reasonable, but withoutexpressing any agreement on pointsoutside existing Cabinet decisions.(b) That it was undesirable that theParliamentary Under Secretary of state should follow his visit to Paris by afurther visit to Rome.(The Cabinet adjourned at 12.50 p.m. until 2 p,m.)
3,    The Cabinet had under consideration a Note bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.206(33))covering a Memorandum by the Foreign Office and aMemorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty(CP.214(33)) regarding the incident on July 31st atBasidu (a Naval station on an island in the persian gulf) where the British flag, which was untended at thetime, had been hauled down by Persian naval officers.As a result of semi-official representations byHis Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires at Tehran (made pendingthe receipt of official instructions), the PersianGovernment had issued categorical orders to their Navyto avoid all interference with British Naval arrange-ments, had administered a severe reproof to theCommander of the Persian Fleet (who had himself been one of the officers concerned), had spontaneouslyexpressed their regret and had offered to examineany other complaints which we might have against thePersian Navy.The question for decision by the Cabinet was howfar it was desirable to go in demanding from Persiaadditional visible reparation for the incident.The First Lord of the Admiralty urged in his memorandum that it was essential to rehabilitate ourposition by insisting on visible reparation such as therehoisting of the flag by Persians at Basidu, in thepresence of British warships.     The First Lord suggestedthat a flotilla of destroyers should be ordered at once to the Persian Gulf in order to impress the Persianswith the fact that we were in earnest in our demand for reparation.      This Naval demonstration would not initself imply any forcible step.-12-
On the other hand, the Foreign Office Memorandumgave reasons in support of the view that the additionaladvantages to he gained by the attempt to secure sucha ceremony would be incommensurate with the risksincurred.    The demand would probably be regarded asan intolerable humiliation by the Shah,  and there wasa strong likelihood of it being rejected.    Any attemptto enforce compliance would mean a serious crisis in anglo-Persian relations, with many repercussions e.g.,on the Henjam question.    The view of the Foreign office was that the amends already made might be accepted assufficient,  if accompanied by a written recapitulation(to be circulated to the principal Arab rulers of thePersian Gulf)  of the a at ur e-e^g- js-e-- a p o I o gl e a -mgrebs and instructions issued by the Persian Government.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thoughtit important to mention that after the flag had beenhauled down -on the 31st July, a^sloop had^proceeded to be    &apos; d i^^TJia^jJiOpp^Ti0cl appeared on the scone.....and;August 5th the flag had been rehoisted and an armed guard-posted.      The British flag was, therefore, now flying atBasidu      He suggested that the Navy might find means ofgiving&apos;some of the Sheil^ ocular proof of this,THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY pointed out thatthe Foreign Office view appeared to be based on the.assumption that the hauling down of the flag at Basidu hadbeen a mistake.      No action, however,  could be taken whichwas better calculated to. lower British prestige, in theGulf.    Moreover, the action was consistent with thepin-pricks which the Persian Government had been administeringto us for a long time past.    Hitherto we had only reactedwhen the question turned on oil.      If the episode at Basiduwere a deliberate insult, the Persians would say that weonly turned round when they attacked us in the oilfields.-13-
He quoted a telegram just received from the ftavalCommander-in-Chief to the effect that a Persian &amp;mr&amp;srscv^had approached the Sheikh of Ras-el-Kheimar urging him totransfer his allegiance to Persia and making the most ofthe Basidu incident.     This was part of an extensivepropaganda along the  Trucial coast.      He agreed that itwas difficult to enforce the action he proposed on Persia.The only weapon was the Treaty and he did not know whetherthis was more important to Persia or ourselves.    He recalledour long traditions in the Gulf, which were threatened,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA said that thiswas a really serious incident.      The hauling down of theflag had been carried out by the Senior Naval Officer ofthe Persian Fleet who was a responsible person.      We had held the Basidu concession for more than one hundred yearsand had received it not from Persia but from the Imam ofMuskat.      It was another episode in the long series of attacks on our prestiges in the Gulf.      Realising this) his department had got into touch with the Acting Resident inthe Gulf, the Resident, who was at present on leave, andthe Government of India.        The result was to show that what was needed above all was prompt action to show theSheiks that we were not abandoning our position in the Gulf.He himself would have preferred a demonstration in whichthe Persian Navy was compelled to take part.    He thought,however, that it would be very difficult to compel the persians to adopt this course and, at any rate, it wouldtake a very long time.    Delay was dangerous.      In thecircumstances, he was forced to the conclusion that theplan of compelling the Persians to take part in a ceremonythat we mustmust be abandoned, and/  * fall back on the plan of getting the Sheikas to realise the actual position.    He suggested that-14-
to get an apology was not sufficient.    We ought at once to send in writing a circular to the Sheikas saying thatthe Union Jack had been rehoisted and an apology offered by the Persians.   We should then get an apology in writingand send a copy to each of the Sheikfe.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS didnot differ in principle from the Secretary of State forIndia, but expressed doubt as to whether it was advisable to take action in two stages.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the danger of delay might be avoided by informing the Sheikfs that we had sent a landing party and that the flag was now flying.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER suggested the advisability Of sending some warships to the Gulf.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthis course had been criticised on the ground that thoughthe first impression would be favourable the Arabs would expect some drastic action and when it did not take place the result would be bad.THE PRIME MINISTER felt doubts as to mentioningan apology in the first announcement.      The Cabinet were reminded, however, that Mr.Mallett had expressed the viewthat the Persian Foreign minister&apos;s statement would justify an announcement.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs emphasised the danger of Persia subsequently repudiatingtheir apology.    The Cabinet were reminded, however, thatthe Persian Foreign Minister had actually repudiatedthe action of the Persian Senior Naval Officer.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the statements-15-y
made by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs toHis Majesty rs Charge dTAffaires at Teheran,  as setforth in Paragraph 3 of CP.206(33) might be communicatedat once to the Sheikhs,THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY suggested thatin this event the Information should be taken to the Sheikhsby a destroyer flotilla which was now lying off thePalestine coast ready to start at once for the persian gulf,    The appearance of this flotilla he thought was calculated to impress the Sheikhs.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA suggested that information of the cabinet intentions should be telegraphedfirst to our Minister at Teheran and to the Acting resident in the Gulf, who &quot;would no doubt send their comments.The Cabinet agreed:-(a)      That the proposal to insist upon reparation bythe Persian Havy in ceremonial form should not beadopted,  owing to the great difficulties that wouldbe met in inducing the Persian Government to consent and to the delay involved in a matter inwhich prompt  action was necessary.&apos; (b)      That short of the proposal in (a)  the most drastic action should be taken in order to bring home tothe Sheikhs on the Trucial coast the facts of thesituation as  set forth in CP.206 (33) , as well asthe fact that the Union jack was rehoisted atBasidu a few days after it had been hauled downand is still flying there.(c) That the details of the action to be taken shouldbe concerted between the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs,  the Secretary of State for India,and the First Lord of the Admiralty, with an over-riding instruction from the Cabinet that  immediate .action   &apos;   is to be taken.&apos;(d) That in the meanwhile the First Lord of theAdmiralty  should be authorised to order a flotillaof destroyers now on the Palestine coast toproceed to the Persian Gulf.
-$IRAQ. The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary(CP. 207(33))  covering a copy of cor respondentThe AssyrianDifficulties,    between His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires at Bagdad andthe Iraqi Minister of Foreign Affairs and of NotesDeportationof Mar Shimun    to the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq Command.    these and family-documents set out the circumstances in which IVIar(Previous^Reference:        Shimun and his family were on August 16th deprivedCabinet 41(32), Con-^      of Iraqi nationality and ordered to be deported!and in which they were conveyed out of the countryelusion 1.)Sbfe^tj. the RoYal Air Force.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs invited the attention of the Cabinet to the difficult situation that had arisen as the result of recentdeplorable events in Iraq.    He recalled that, when theLeague of Nations had beon asked to agree that theMandate should terminate in Iraq,  the Mandates commission had raised specifically the question of the position of minorities such as the Assyrians.    Sir Francis Humphryshad made a statement to the effect that,  in his view,minorities would be safe and that,  should Iraq proveunworthy of the confidence placed In her in terminating the Mandate,  the moral responsibility must rest with theUnited Kingdom Government and not with the mandates commission.    Sir Francis Humphrys&apos;   statement had been included in the report of the Mandates Commission andsome of its Members,  in subsequent diecussion, had drawn attention to this statement.    It was true that,  in thefinal stage of the proceedings,  the Chairman hademphasized that the responsibility of the MandatoryGovernment,   strictly speaking, was limited to theproposal that Iraq should be relieved of the Mandateand it could not be held responsible for what happened
in that country after, the Mandate had been withdrawn.Nevertheless, there was no doubt that Sir FrancisHumphrys&apos;  statement had made an impression on the .Commission and attention was likely to be drawn toit when recent events came before the League of Nations.The Chairman of the Minorities Committee now set up bythe League of Nations was a representative of Mexico andthe other Members came from the Irish Free State and Norway.They were likely to urge an inquiry.       The question the Cabinet had to decide was what our attitude was tobe.       He drew the attention of the Cabinet to recent telegrams from Sir Francis Humphrys expressing a hope that&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government will decline to be associatedat Geneva with any demand for foreign, intervention inIraq, either by means of a forced League inquiry intothe past events on the spot or appointment of residentLeague Commissioner in the north.&quot; and he read to theCabinet the greater part of Baghdad telegrams Nos, 325and 326 of the 4th September.       The Foreign Secretaryhimself felt, however, that some of the representatives at Geneva and supporters of the League of Nations inthis country would demand an inquiry.      There was,however, a possibility that some. Governments who haddifficult minorities to deal with might be unwilling to set a precedent which might subsequently proveinconvenient to them.       In any event,. an inquiry couldnot take place without the consent of the IraqGovernment.       As a matter of fact, the Foreign office had not been able to find a precedent for an inquiryof this kind.The discussion at the Cabinet centred almost    -entirely on the question of what attitude we should
adopt, both towards the Government of the Iraq and theLeague of Nations in the matter of an inquiry.      At thepresent moment the facts were not completely establishedbut there appeared to be little doubt that a number ofAssyrians had been killed by the Iraqi forces.      Anumber of circumstances had not yet been fully cleared up.      In the early stages of the affair a number ofAssyrians had crossed with arms into French mandated territory in Syria where they had been disarmed.      Itwas not clear why the French authorities had returnedtheir arms to some of these men who had subsequently re-crossed into Iraq territory.      Some of the Assyrians had captured an Iraqi post and were said to have massacredand mutilated the garrison.      This might account forretaliation on one occasion.      Subsequently, however,there appeared to have been a second massacre of innocentAssyrians who had given up their arms and who were not even supporters of the dissident Assyrians.     Their case was especially serious as it was from this section that-the Assyrian troops enlisted in the force guarding theR.A.F. aerodromes were drawn.     The Iraqi Government hadnot allowed officers of the Royal Air Force or theBritish Military Mission to investigate all the facts.Another disagreeable feature in the situation was theovation given to the Iraqi forces on their return toreportedBaghdad, the/promotion of the Commanding Officer and theaward of seniority to the Officers.     King Feisal&apos;s inactionand failure to give facilities to British Officers wasalso criticised.      In all these circumstances it was urged that we could not remain quiescent and do nothing,and that we must express ourselves definitely in favourof an inquiry by the League of Nations.     This was themore incumbent upon us in view of our obligations to the
Assyrians in the war.      Sir Francis Humphrys&apos;representations quoted above (underlined) werecontrasted with the policy he favoured of urging the Iraqi Government to anticipate League opinion by itself demanding an inquiry.A suggestion was made that we might take up with the Turks the question of the possible re-settlement of the Assyrians in the Turkish territorythey had formerly occupied.      The feasibility of thiswas doubtful as the Kurds were likely to havesettled down in any territory worth having.      TheCabinet were reminded, also, that the question of thesettlement of the Assyrians had been in course of operation and the present trouble had arisen fromthe opposition of the Patriarch Mar Shimun, who had insisted on the impossible condition that all the assyrians should be located in one district.    It was urged, however, that the terms of reference to anyinquiry by the League of Nations should include thequestion of settling these people since, after the tremendous upheaval that had taken place, theirsettlement could only be achieved as the result ofan inquiry by the League which brought out itsimperative necessity.      The Cabinet felt generallythat the Iraq Government should be urged once more,in their own interests, to assdciate themselves with a request for an inquiry.      If it was impossibleto bring them to this, it was suggested that possibly they might be induced at least, to accept an inquiry.On a review of all the considerations involved,the Cabinet agreed -
that, notwithstanding the objectionsof Sir Francis Humphrys, it wasimperative that we should associateourselves with a request for an inquiry by the League of Nations,hut that this inquiry should not be confined to recent events but should deal with the future of the Assyrianswith a view to arriving at a final solution.that Sir Francis Humphrys should be told that the above course had been decided on by the Cabinet and was necessary,not merely as a matter of policy but as one of honour.    He should be reminded ofthe assurances that he, himself, had given to the Mandates Commission in 1931.He should be instructed to urge that,from the point of view of the iraqi government themselves, their best course was to join in asking the League for suchan inquiry, the more so since, whetherthey wished it or not, there would be avery strong demand for an inquiry totake place.that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, who was to receive a deputationon this subject after the Cabinet meeting should inform them that the position was extremely delicate and should stipulateat the outset that, as a matter of honourthere must he no disclosure of what hesaid to them.
5.     The Cabinet had under consideration a Note bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP.210(33)) ,to which was appended a Memorandum prepared in theColonial Office, covering the minutes of a meeting ofthe Standing Official Sub-Committee for questions concerning the Middle East, held on the 15th August,together with other papers in regard to the relationsbetween His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Imam of the yemen.These papers had been circulated to the ministerial Sub-Committee on the Middle East by theChairman (the Secretary of State for the Colonies);and the Cabinet were informed that messages had beenreceived from the Secretaries of State for War, air and India, and from the First Lord of the Admiralty,indicating their concurrence in the recommendations ofthe Official Sub-Committee.      (In the case of theSecretary of State for India this concurrence was subject to the agreement of the Secretaries of Statefor Foreign Affairs, the Colonies and Air).     Theviews of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs had not yetbeen indicated.For the recommendations of the Official Sub-Committee see Appendix to these Conclusions.In brief, the Committee&apos;s report showed thatthere now appears to be a reasonable possibilitjr thatpersonal discussion between a British Envoy and the imam will result in the conclusion of a satisfactorytreaty, provided that the Envoy is&quot; authorised, shouldthe Imam prove obdurate, to threaten the breaking off of negotiations, together with forcible measures toassert the rights of His Majesty&apos;s Government in that part of the Aden Protectorate now occupied by the
Imam&apos;s forces; and isi authorised, if necessary, actually to break off negotiations.In the Official Sub-Committee&apos;s view the forciblemeasures referred to might be the bombing, after duewarning, of Rada and Dhamar - -two towns in the Imam1sown territory.      It was thought that he might remainindifferent to the bombing of areas within the Protector-ate, even though occupied by his forces.The Cabinet approved the recommendations of theOfficial Sub-Committee as set forth in the Appendix tothese conclusions.
6.      The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.215(33)) ,in which was set out the result of the representations made to Signor Mussolini in pursuance of earlier cabinet conclusions in regard to the cheeking of Italian culturalpropaganda in Malta.     Signor Mussolini had given thefollowing specific undertakings:-(a) No new Italian schools or institutes wouldbe founded in Malta.(b) No British subjects would in future be admitted to membership of Fascist clubs or organisations(e.g. the Balilla), and the British subjectsthen belonging to those organisations would beexpelled forthwith.(c) Membership of the Institute of Italian Culture(the fons et origo of the propagandistmovement) would be confined to Italian subjects -though it would be difficult to prevent non-Italians from attendinglectures, conferences,etc.On the negative side Signor Mussolini had declined to close the Institute of Italian Culture altogether,and he had also affected to consider that there was nothing irregular in the conduct of the Casa PaulaSchool (which His Majesty&apos;s Government desired him to close) or in the extension of the Umberto I School (whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government desired him to restrict to its pre-1932 scope).     At the same time it was intimated that these refusals were to be taken to mean that theItalian Government would prefer His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto take the necessary action themselves.In these circumstances, the following course ofaction had been provisionally agreed upon by the ForeignOffice and the Colonial Office, in consultation with;theGovernor of Malta:-The Governor to return to Malta and to enact the ordinance for the control of aliens referred to in
Cabinet 44(33), Conclusion 3, which would have thepractical effect of making all foreign schools andinstitutes in the island subject to licence.      signor mussolini to be informed in advance of the proposed actionwhich would not, however, be discussed with him.Before proceeding, however, it had been thoughtwell again to consult Sir R. Graham (His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Rome), who was on leave in this country.Sir R. Graham had thought that the proposed action, ifsuitably presented to Signor Mussolini, would probably not cause the latter serious annoyance, but had feareda somewhat violent reaction on the part of Italian public feeling.      Italians in general had an absurd but ineradic-able conviction that Malta was inhabited by a race of italian culture and language, if not of origin.      Sir R.Graham had suggested as an alternative that satisfactory results might be obtained by bringing personal pressure tobear on the Directors of the Italian schools and institu-tions in the island.In the present state of European affairs, Sir john simon saw no alternative to inviting the Cabinet to consider the Maltese problem afresh.      If it were the case thatthe German-Austrian situation could only be surmounted byclose co-operation between Prance, Italy and ourselves,was this a time to effect a breach with Italian publicopinion?     He felt bound to suggest that direct actionagainst Italian institutions in Malta should be suspendedtemporarily until the international situation was clearer,and that in the meantime the possibilities of bringinglocal influence to bear on the Directors of the Institutesetc., as suggested by Sir R. Graham, should be further explored.      There would be no objection, from the inter-national standpoint, to a warning being delivered to the25.
Maltese Ministers.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs addedthat while the Secretary of State for the Colonies had agreed to the circulation of the present memorandum, itshould not he taken as an expression of the latter views.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE-COLONIES recalled that from the first it had been understood at the Cabinetthat if the Government embarked on the policy he had proposed for dealing with Italian propaganda in Malta,they must go through with it.     The Cabinet had been advised that the moment was a favourable one for going ahead and a start had been made.     An approach had beenmade to S. Mussolini, whose attitude had not beenaltogether unfavourable.      If we were now to recede from our position the effect would be very serious.      He gavemuch evidence of a recent increase in the volume and scope of Italian propaganda in Malta with the connivanceof Ministers, including pressure on Civil Servants, thetraining of.a great number of additional teachers in theItalian language, the printing of Government forms in italian-English instead of Maltese-English as formerly,and even contemplated new issues of postage stamps, withan Italian bias.     This could not possibly go on and thetime might come when we should have to take over Maltaagain and run it as a Crown Colony.     There was little doubt that Maltese Ministers knew everything that tookplace in Rome.      If we drew back now, everyone in Malta would know that the Government had weakened.      If, asthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs urged, themoment was inopportune, when would the situation change?Was the Austro-German difficulty likely to end -soon?Might it not go on for years?     Meanwhile, the situation
in Malta was urgent.      If we drew back now S. Mussolini,who was above all things a realist, would see that hehad only to stand firm to get his way with us.      he paid a tribute to the helpful attitude of the Vatican.ofIn view of strong reasons adduced by the Secretary/State for the Colonies, the Cabinet agreed -That the Ministers concerned shouldcontinue to carry out the policyalready approved by the Cabinet(Cabinet 44(33), Conclusion 3 and earlier conclusions.)..
I^YAL 7.      The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theCONSTRUCTION        &apos; , .    ., .  ,FOR 1933. First Lord of the Admiralty (CP. 213(33))  in which it(Previous was recalled that, with the Cabinet&apos;s approval, thereReferencetCabinet 1(33) , had been incorporated in Navy Estimates for 1933 a NewConclusion 8).Construction. Programme including 1 Cruiser of theF.R.LEANDER Class of 7,250 tons and 3 Cruisers of theARETHUSA Class of 5,400 tons.      This programme con-stituted the fourth and final instalment of the new construction Programme due for completion by the 31stDecember, 1936, under the terms of the London naval treaty.The limit of tonnage of our cruisers had beenadopted by us in the hope that other Countries would follow our lead.inThese hopes had been frustrated.      In 1931 japan had laid down two Cruisers of 8,500 tons armed with 156&quot; guns and was now laying down two more ships of thesame dimensions.      The United States had also announced their intention of building four Cruisers of 10,000 tonsarmed with 15 6&quot; guns.      It appeared that such ships were being adopted as a class and that, as a result of a combination of the limitation of total cruiser tonnageimposed upon us by the Treaty and of our own vital needfor numbers, our new cruiser types, if the programme already approved were adhered to, would be definitelyinferior to those being developed by Foreign Navies.The Board of   Admiralty had been forced to the conclusionthat it would prove necessary to alter the programme approved by the Cabinet and Parliament and to get outre designs for a new and more powerful cruiser, armed with more 6&quot; guns and capable of withstanding 6&quot; gun fire.Designs were being worked out by the technical departments;until these were complete it would not be known whether
it would be possible to order two or (alternatively)three cruisers, (within the limits of tonnage remainingunder the London Naval Treaty) at the end of the present financial year.If it proved impossible to have three of the new type, the Admiralty proposed to have two of the new typeand 1 ARETHUSA.This  alteration would reduce our total number of cruisers to 49 instead of 50, the number which was accepted for the period of the London Naval Treaty, but this de-efficiency could be met by including four ships in the 1934programme and, if necessary, by laying one of them downearly in the year.The First Lord was not yet in a position to give a comparative statement of the cost of the new programmeproposed for 1933, but he did not anticipate that it would exceed that of the former programme in the aggregate, andit would he kept within the financial provision for theyear.In the course of the discussion stress was laid on the reduction involved in the First Lord of theAdmiralty&apos;s plan of the total number of British cruisersfrom 50 to 49.    It was recalled that at the time ofthe London Naval Conference the Admiralty had insisted that 50 cruisers was the absolute minimum required toenable the Navy to protect our trade routes.THE FIRST LORD admitted that even 50 cruisers hadbeen accepted most reluctantly by the Admiralty.    Inputting forward their proposals the Board had had toaccept the lesser of two evils.    The Cabinet recognised.*
that, as indicated in CP. 213 (33), it was probablethat at a later stage the Admiralty would probablybe compelled to invite them to consider provision ofthe 50th cruiser in some subsequent programme,THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER drew attention tothe fact that the proposals of the First Lord of theAdmiralty had not been discussed departmentally withthe Treasury in accordance with the usual practice.He suggested that no serious harm could result if theCabinet postponed a decision for a few weeks, so as toenable departmental discussions to take place.He also raised the question of whether representa-tions ought not to be made to the United States ofAmerica   in respect of their action in placing ordersfor a type of cruiser that opened up the prospect ofa fresh competition in armaments.THE FIRST LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY was anxious toobtain a decision in principle as soon as possible.Although the actual contracts could not be placed fora month or two, there was a great deal of detailed work that would have to be carried out inside the Admiraltyas soon as the designs were approved.    He was reluctant to put this work in hand until the Cabinet had given their decision, but he warned his colleagues that, ifdelay occurred, he would have to take the risk ofinitiating work on these details, notwithstanding therisk of wasting the time of the staff concerned.In connection with the proposal that representationsshould be made to the United States of America, theCabinet were informed that the adoption by the UnitedStates of a cruiser of 10,000 tons displacement, armed
with 15 6&quot; guns, and. the placing of orders for them,was not technically inconsistent with the terms of theLondon Naval Treaty.THE PRIME MINISTER, however, was under a strongimpression that there had been an understanding that action such as this affecting the other parties tothe Treaty would not be taken without some priorcommunication and consultation.    He suggested that the records of conversations during the London naval conference might be searched, with a view to checkinghis recollection.    If the circumstances warranted, hewould like the Foreign Office to address a memorandum to the American Secretary of State intimating that wehad built up our programmes on the assumption thatcertain types of ship would be-adopted; reminding him that at one time 7,500 tons had been regarded as an extreme tonnage for 6&quot; cruisers - though the Japanese had always rather demurred to this figure; observingthat the Japanese had now increased the size   of their5&quot; cruisers to 8,500 tons, and that the United states had raised this figure to 10,000 tons; pointing out that new types of ships involved new tactics and opened uplarge questions.    In consequence we, who had at one time been prepared to come down to 6,900 tons as the maximumsize of the 6&quot; gun cruiser, found ourselves compelled tobuild the larger types.    We greatly regretted thisnecessity and though admitting that, technically, theUnited States Government were within their rights,regretted that they had felt bound to place their orderswithout any prior communication with ourselves.
At the close of the discussion the First Lord ofthe Admiralty said that his Department had receivedvery secret information to the effect that the personnel of the Japanese Navy was larger than previously admitted,with the result that the figures for the three principalNaval Powers were as followst-The Cabinet agreed:-(a) that a decision on the questions raised in the memorandum by the First Lord ofthe Admiralty (CP. 213 (33)) shouldbe postponed for the moment, but thatthe subject should be taken withinthe first two meetings of the cabinet when it resumed regular meetings.(b) that, in the meanwhile, the admiralty should place themselves in communicationwith the Treasury,(c) that the Admiralty (Rear Admiral R. M.Bellairs) and the foreign Office(Mr, R, L, Craigie) should, as soonas possible, make a close study of theAmerican action in placing orders for10,000 ton cruisers armed with 15 6&quot;.guns, in the light of the proceedings and records of conversations of theLondon Naval Conference, 1930, andother relevant circumstances, with aview to representations being made bythe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to the United States Secretaryof State, if the circumstancesjustified it.United kingdom united States of90,300AmericaJapan107,000101,000
EMPIRE MARKETINGBOARD.Future of PosterFrames.(previous reference:Cabinet 08(33)-,Conclusion 8).5^)8. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (CP. 211(33)), raising the question of the 1,650 poster frames,the property of the Empire Marketing Board, whichwere distributed over the 475 principal towns ofGreat Britain and Northern Ireland.      The approachingdissolution of the Board on September 30th madenecessary a decision regarding the disposal of theseframes.The frames would pass out of the use of theEmpire Marketing Board during the present month(September), during which they would be at thedisposal of the Minister of Health for the display,at the charge of his Department, of posters supporting the Government&apos;s housing policy.      This arrangementhad been suggested at a meeting of the CabinetCommittee on Trade and Employment.The Prime Minister and the Chancellor of theExchequer had already approved the continued use ofthe frames during the months of October and November,During October they would be used by the PostmasterGeneral for publicity purposes, at the charge of post Office funds.     Discussions were taking placeregarding the use of the frames during November.As regards the future use of the frames,which were calculated to have an average remaininglife of from five to ten years, the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs suggested that they should be putunder the control of a body on which all political parties were represented.       The only step necessary-33-
at present was that the Cabinet should, take a generaldecision for or against the policy of continuing the frames,and that,  if the decision should he in favour of theircontinuance, a small Committee should he appointed toreport -(a)    how the poster frames should be controlled,and      (b)        how they should be financed and managed.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS withdrewthe proposal in Paragraph 3 of CP.211(33) for the composition of the suggested controlling Committee.The Cabinet agreed -(a) To approve the policy of continuing theposter frames for the present.(b) That the Cabinet Committee on ImperialEconomic Co-operation should consider andreport whether the frames should continueto be maintained and,  in that case -(i)    how the poster frames should be controlled,and      (ii))    how they should be financed and managed.(c) That the four Trade Sub-Committees attachedto the Empire Marketing Board should becont continued.

APPENDIX.RELATIONS OF HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT WITH THE IMAMOF THE YEMEN.Recommendations of the Standing Official Sub-Committee for questions concerning the, Middle East.(l). (a) That there now seems a reasonable possibility of bringing the treaty negotiations to a successful conclusion if an envoy can be sent to Sanaa for personal discussion with the Imam;    provided theenvoy is previously authorised, should the Imamprove obdurate -(i) To inform the Imam that the breaking off of negotiations will inevitably follow failure by the Imam and the envoy to r each agreement;.,that the envoy feels sure that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will not any longer tolerate thepresence of Zeidi forces in territory whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government claim for the aden protectorate; and that if negotiations arebroken off, His Majesty&apos;s Government will inall probability feel compelled to assertforcibly their rights in Audhali, and otherterritory occupied by Zeidi forces.(ii) To break off negotiations.NOTE:-   In point of fact, it is hopedthat if the Resident is placed in aposition to make a statement of this kindit will clinch the negotiations and avoid the need for any forcible action forclearing the Audhali territory, but theenvoy must have an assurance that, ifnecessary, His Majesty&apos;s Government will use force to clear the Audhali countryand other areas in the Protectorateoccupied by Zeidi forces, as the position will be quite impossible unless an ultimatum can be sent to the Imam after   .the negotiations are broken off.(b) That while continuance of negotiations for a treatymay be regarded as a departure, in a strict sense,from the instructions approved earlier in the yearto the effect that His Majesty&apos;s Government had saidtheir last word, the Imam&apos;s letter can be accepted as a sufficient advance to justify the ActingResident informing the Imam that the Resident will come to Sanaa, on his return   in the autuirfn, forthe purpose of concluding a treaty; but that inorder that there may be no misapprehension, the imam must understand that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentrequire the trade restrictions to be raised and theother preliminaries laid down in the Resident&apos;sadmonitory note to be carried out before the treaty
is actually signed, and that while the Residentwill he prepared to discuss matters of wording inthe text of.the treaty proposed by the Imam, the secret annexe cannot be agreed to in any form.(c) That in the event of action becoming necessary forthe recovery of Audhali territory, it is essentialthat authority should be given for bombing, afterthe usual warnings,  suitable military objectiveswithin Imamic territory, and that we must not belimited to local action in the friendly Audhaliterritory now occupied by the Zeidis and on our side of the boundary.(d) That in any scheme for forcible recovery of territoryoccupied by Zeidi forces, it would not be possibleto rely upon irregular tribal levies to carry out an organised attack; that their role should belimited to temporary occupation of territory whencleared by air action; and that it will in the mainrest with the Royal Air Force not only to clearterritory occupied by Zeidi forces, but also, ifnecessary, to prevent reoccupation of that territory by the threat or resumption of air action againstmilitary objectives in the Imam&apos;s territory.(e) That the Resident should have discretion to discussand accept verbal amendments in the text of thetreaty, but that the Colonial Office and theForeign Office should consider whether any of theparticular amendments now suggested by the Imammust be objected to.(2),  (a) That as regards the incursion by Zeidi forces intothe Subeihi country referred to in the ActingResident&apos;s telegram of the 14th August, 1933(Paper No. M.E.(0) 101), the Acting Resident shouldbe authorised to despatch an ultimatum to the Imam,concurrently with a notification to the governor of Taiz, demanding withdrawal and restoration ofthe prisoners and loot, to be followed in theevent of non-compliance by air action, after theusual local warnings, against Taiz or other suitablemilitary objectives within the Imam&apos;s territory inthe vicinity of the disturbed area.(b) That the Foreign Office should take the necessary steps to advise the Italian Government of recent events in the Subeihi country, and the actionwhich it is proposed to take.(c) That action in connection with the incursion intothe Subeihi country should be taken at the earliestpossible moment, allowing the minimum necessary timefor the delivery of an ultimatum to the Imam and of notification to the Italian Government,(3). That the Colonial Office should take the instructions ofthe Secretary of State for the Colonies, as Chairman ofthe Standing Ministerial Sub-Committee for questions concerning the Middle East, whether the action to betaken on the despatches and telegram from the ActingResident under discussion should be submitted to the ministerial Sub-Committee or to the Cabinet.
