BECHUANALAND. 1. The Secretary of State for Dominion...Affairs called the attention of the Cabinet to theTrials of WhiteMen by Native public interest that had been aroused over aChiefs.recent incident in Bechuanaland mere the ChiefTshekedi had dealt with the misdemeanours of a european in a native court in consequence of whichhe had been suspended from exercising the chieftainship.      He had received great numbersof letters on this episode which consequentlyhad become a matter of some political importance.The point of principle involved was that the Chiefhad claimed the right to try a European and thiswas a point on which no concession could be made.The Chief was due to sail for London on Fridaynext, September 22nd.      The Secretary of State wasnot without hope, however, that before that dateTshekedi might accept the advice of his Counseland express his regret to Vice Admiral Evans,  the acting High Commissioner, in which case he proposed,&quot;if the Cabinet agreed, to sanction his reinstatement.The Secretary of State also intended to examinethe action of the Magistrate concerned.      In reply toa question he explained that the course he proposedto take was supported both by Vice Admiral Evans,the Acting High Commissioner, and by Sir H.  Stanley,the High Commissioner, who was in this country.The Cabinet concurred in the action proposedby the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs.%
2.The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of the Reduction and Limitationof Armaments:-Telegrams 269 and 270 from Mr. Murray (Rome)giving details of proposals made by theItalian Government to the French Government(CP. 219 (35) - a translation of theproposals is attached in Appendix I):A telegram dated 15th September to the french ambassador (Rome) containing the reply of theFrench Government (CP. 221 (33)).      this reply, while very friendly in tone, pointedout that the proposals would have to b e made more precise at a later date.      It alsocontained detailed comments raising manycontroversial points:A telegram from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in rome containing a summary of the conversationsof the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs in Paris on September 18th.(CP.  218 (33) - Appendix II).    While theParliamentary Under-Secretary of Stateconsidered that the French proposals constitutedan advance in disarmament as compared withJune last, he reported that M. Daladier had asked to be reassured as to the attitude whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government would adopt if germany were proved by supervision to bere-arming:A note by the Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs covering a more detailed record of the same conversations.(CP. 220 (33)).      In his covering noteMr. Eden stated that M. Daladier preferred to arrive at some common accord with theUnited Kingdom and, if possible, also with italy, to save the Disarmament Conferencerather than any of the more drastic methodsopen to him for reassuring the real anxietiesof the French people on the German attitude.The Prime Minister said he had been informedthat a decision had to be taken before the end of thepresent week in connection with the Paris conversations.That was why had had summoned an emergency meeting ofthe Cabinet.      He had also thought it advisable to invite the presence of the Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs in order that the cabinet might have the fullest opportunity to obtain information on what had occurred.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,,,agreeawith the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State that apoint had &quot;been reached when decisions were required fromthe Cabinet.      The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of state had been asked to go to Paris and explore what the french were prepared to do in the way of disarmament, a pointon which hitherto their attitude had always been somewhatvague.        He was to find out whether they contemplatedany disarmament, or even     contingent disarmament, and, if so, what it was.        The Under-Secretary of State hadaccomplished this task successfully without undertakingany commitment whatsoever.      Putting the substance of the under-Secretary of State&apos;s report in as definite a form as possible, the Secretary of State said that its purportwas somevt/loat as follows:-     The French Government didwant a Disarmament Convention.      They did not take the view-that in consequence of recent events in Germany noConvention was desirable.      In conjunction with the ItalianGovernment they contemplated a Convention divided into two parts.      Part I would cover the next four years, and part II a second period of four years.      Part I wouldprovide for the transformation of the Reichswehr and forall-round reductions in effectives on the lines of theBritish proposals.      During this first period of fouryears there would be no new armament in weapons whichultimately were to be prohibited.      During this period,however, the French desired a control and inspectionwhich would be automatic and periodic and not broughtinto operation only in the event of a complaint.      In a word,  it was to be part of a regular system of inspection.In part II the French would say that by the end of thesecond period they would be prepared to agree to asubstantial reduction in armaments.      For example,a reduction of 50 per cent,  in their Air Force, a formula which Mr. Eden had pointed out would be unfair to us and, therefore, unacceptable without adjustment. Similarly,by that time
all guns exceeding 155 mm. would have been disposed of.In the matter of tanks, they wanted either a 30 tontank or, as an alternative, a global tonnage limitation.For the first time, therefore,  the Secretary of Statecontinued,  the French had said what they were prepared todo and it was something quite substantial.      As regardsautomatic inspectign, he had meeting received a very clearimpression from Mr. Norman Davis, but he had seen a statementpublished from Washington that the United States wereprepared to accept the principle of periodic and regularinspection.      The Italians had declared tneir willingness toaccept a Convention of this kind in two parts and were infavour of a system of periodic inspection.      He did not know the G-erman view.The urgency of the question, the Secretary ofState explained, was that some Minister ought to go to paris this week to continue the conversations since theFrench Prime Minister was available for the purpose.The Frensh desi red a Convention and were in closeraccord with Italy than they had been for a long time.It would be a hopeful step if the United Kingdom, Franceand Italy could be brought into agreement.The Secretary of State added that there appeared to be only two alternatives, viz:    (l) noConvention at all, involving a breakdown of the Disarma-ment Conference.      This would be serious internationallyand from the point of view of internal politics.    Ifsuch a breakdown occurred, Germany would re-arm as andwhen she liked and in his view no one could stop her.(2) To enter into this Convention in two parts whichthe Germans might be brought to accept, though their acceptance would probably involve, at any rate in thesecond period, permission to have some specimens of weapons forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles to Germanybut which other powers intended to keep.     that.
undoubtedly was an objection to which many advocates of disarmament would attach importance and on v/hichperhaps statements by members of the Government mightbe quoted against them.      Nevertheless, if the other powers would not reduce their armaments, germany would have to be allowed some increase of hers as acondition of a Treaty.      If the Cabinet were preparedto face that objection as well as the Franco-Italianplan of inspection and controls  it might be possibleto get a Convention.     On the point of control, however, theParliamentary Undersecretary of State had been careful to reserve our position.      The Secretary of State himself could see no overwhelming objections to any measure of control and inspection which the United States Government was prepared to accept.     All depended on what was to bethe function of the Control Committee,      It must nothave a roving commission and its functions should belimited to establishing that the undertakings enteredinto by the various States should not be disregarded.For example, if those undertakings were of aqualitative character,  the Committee would have to assure themselves that the weapons did not exceed theprohibited limits.      If the undertakings werequantitative in character,  they would have to assurethemselves that the numbers of aeroplanes, guns,tanks, and so forth allowed were not exceeded.      Theproposal had arisen out of the desire of France toknow what Germany was doing.      He did not see whyin the case of the United Kingdom and the United Statesof America the control should not be exercised in alighter form than in the case of continental Powers.If that point should be accepted all that we had to dowas,  in conjunction with France and Italy, to draw up a list of the measures of disarmament we wereprepared to carry out in three or four years and toset up the Commission now.
In reply to questions from members of theCabinet the Parliamentary Under Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs said he was not sure that theGermans would be willing to forego?until the second,period of the Convention,the possession of specimensof weapons&apos;-,, forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles butretained by other nations.    . There was no certainty that the Germans might not ask for specimens in thefirst period.      Broadly speaking, he thought that theItalian proposals might be taken as some, indication ofwhat the Germans might be willing to accept.       Thescrapping of guns over 155mm. applied only to mobileguns and not to fixed defences.      As regards budgetary limitation, the French might desire it in the first period but might perhaps be induced to be--.-content-withpublicity-&apos;..until the second period.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thoughtthat the Italians might be willing to contemplate theGermans having specimens of certain forbidden weaponsafter the first periodsbut not the French.      Nevertheless,in order to obtain supervision on the lines they desired the French might be willing to make concessions.The Parliamentary.Under Secretary of State saidthat as bearing on this point M. Daladier had indicated at one point that the French would not be afraid ifthe Germans brought thirty ton tanks against theirfortifications.The Prime Minister said he v/as quite clear as towhat would happen in the second period of the Treaty if all had gone well in the first period.      He .asked,however, what would happen if things went badly in thefirst period.
The Parliamentary Under Secretary of state said that if the Supervision ^Committee&apos; s- Reports, showed that Germany v/as not carrying out the ConventionPrance would then refuse to carry out the disarmamentmeasures contemplated for the second period.      TheFrench Government also wished to know what our attitude would he if the Germans were proved to beviolating the Convention.        They did not seem to trouble themselves very much as to our attitude aboutviolation of the Treaty of Versailles, but now Frenchopinion v/as saying that the Locarno Treaty had beenviolated and they asked why if the Locarno treaty was not observed any later treaty could be relied on.The Prime Minister said he had understood thatif the Germans did not observe the Treaty the french would expect us to take some action.The Secretary of State for the Colonies sugges-ted that the whole of the Cabinet were agreed thatwe could not bind ourselves to take any action at allin such a contingency.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs agreed that we could enter into no new commitment.The First Lord of the Admiralty asked whetherthe French really intended any disarmament at all.Up to now they had been very adroit in avoidingdisarmament.      They had escaped from the period ofthe London Naval Treaty.      Under these new proposalsthey gained a period of four years in which they didnot have to disarm at all.      At the end of four yearsthey would certainly he able to find some excuse notto disarm.The Parliamentary Under Secretary of Statethought that the French did desire a Convention.
The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs thoughtthat the whole Cabinet were agreed that there should be ;.no new commitment.       The only question was as to whetherwithout such commitment we ought not to try and get aConvention.The Prime Minister thought the Cabinet ought totake a decision on the subject of supervision.      it ought not, however, to be a mere &apos;yea&apos; or ^ay&apos; decision.Words would have to be carefully chosen and he would want to see them on paper.      It was not enough for usto authorise the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs to say that the British Government was willing to agreeto supervision.      That might place us in a difficult position.The Secretary of State for the Colonies drew attention to the following passage on page 4 of cp.  220(33)  -&quot;Monsieur Daladier ........ observed that certain of the German preparations, of which he had informa-tion. affected the Rhineland, and to that extentaffected the Treaty of Locarno&quot;.The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State forForeign Affairs thought that M- Daladier had beenreferring to the fact that the Rhineland. was ademilitarised zone, and that certain movements oftroops and fortifications therein constituted violation of the Locarno Treaty.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said there was a strong argument that that did not involve us in any commitment.     We were only involved to theextent of action in the event of a flagrant violation,-The Secretary of State for War, after reading infull the passage from which the above extract is taken,pointed out that M. Daladier had not been satisfied
with Lord Tyrrell&apos;s suggestion that in the event of a violation of the Convention by Germany the otherGovernments should he free from their obligation toreduce their armaments.       He had said &quot;that something more would he required, and he would like to know the degree of support on which he could in that event rely&quot;.M. Daladier thought &quot;that English public opinion wouldbe prepared to agree that if Germany violated theConvention, freely entered into by her, there would bean occasion for definite action&quot;.      We of course didnot intend to take any action, but M. Daladier said itwas essential for him to know.Turning to the question of supervision, the Secretaryof State for War did not agree with the view that had been expressed that the only problem that remained was that ofa rigid supervision.        If that was the only outstandingpoint he agreed it would be a great responsibility forthe Cabinet to refuse a Convention on that point alone.The Cabinet, however, had before them the Italianproposals and the French replies.       There were pointsboth in the Italian proposals and in the French reply that were unacceptable to us, and there were points inthe Italian proposals that were unacceptable to theFrench.      For example, the proposed concession todisarmed Powers of a quota of forbidden weapons hadevoked strong protests from the French Government(CP. 221 (33), pages 7-9).      If at the present stagewe were to agree to the French proposals for supervisionwe should be making the same mistake as we had madeearlier in the Disarmament Conference of making con-cessions which did not produce agreement.     The Cabinet,he recalled,  for  very good reasons, which had not been confined to those urged by the Defence Ministers, had
with Lord, Tyrrell&apos;s suggestion that in the event of a violation of the Convention by Germany the otherGovernments should be free from their obligation toreduce their armaments.       He had said &quot;that something more would be required, and he would like to know the degree of support on which he could in that event rely&quot;.M. Daladier thought &quot;that English public opinion wouldbe prepared to agree that if Germany violated theConvention, freely entered into by her, there would bean occasion for definite action&quot;.     We of course didnot intend to take any action, but M. Daladier said itwas essential for him to know.Turning to the question of supervision, the Secretaryof State for War did not agree with the view that had been expressed that the only problem that remained was that ofa rigid supervision.        If that was the only outstandingpoint he agreed it would be a great responsibility forthe Cabinet to refuse a Convention on that point alone.The Cabinet, however, had before them the Italianproposals and the French replies.        There were pointsboth in the Italian proposals and in the French reply that were unacceptable to us, and there were points inthe Italian proposals that were unacceptable to theFrench.      For example, the proposed concession todisarmed Powers of a quota of forbidden weapons hadevoked strong protests from the French Government(CP. 221 (33) , pages 7-9).      If at the present stagewe were to agree to the French proposals for supervisionwe should be making the same mistake as we had madeearlier in the Disarmament-Conference of making con-cessions which did not produce agreement.      The Cabinet,he recalled,  for  very good reasons, which had not been confined to those urged by the Defence Ministers, had
rejected the French theories of supervision.    Speakingfor himself, as a member of the Cabinet rather than as Secretary of State for War, he could say that ifsupervision was the only point standing in the way ofthe conclusion of the Convention he would thinkseriously before refusing the proposals agreed to byother Governments, but he would certainly want toknow, in detail, what those proposals were.      Atpresent we   had no knowledge of what was involved,and he had been asked by his Department to suggest thatthis information should be ascertained.       As a matterof fact, however, as he had already pointed out,supervision was by no means the only outstanding point.The French had raised many points in the Italian proposals that they could not accept.      The War Office could not possibly accept the fourth proposal of the ItalianGovernment that during the first period the present level of land and air armaments and of the expenditurerelating thereto should not be exceeded.     We hadalready disarmed to a degree that rendered our positionmost perilous if there v/ere any risk of war within thenext few years.     The late Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff, on resigning office, had warned him that an expenditure of  30 million would be required to enablethe Expeditionary Force to be ready, not in a month&apos;s time, but within six months.      Our ports v/ere almostundefended, and our anti-aircraft defences were totally inadequate.       He did not think anyone was prepared toallow that state of affairs to continue.     Everyonemust agree that some increase in expenditure on armamentsv/ould be required within the next few years.      Hethought this probably applied to the Royal Air Forcealso,, but, at any1 rate, so far as the War Office v/ereconcerned, it v/as impossible to agree to the Italian10 o
fourth proposal, to which he had referred.     Therewere other proposals into which he did not enterin detail at the moment.      In view of the many out-...standing points on which agreement had not yet beenreached he urged that the Cabinet should adhere totheir previous attitude of making no offers or under-takings beyond those contained in our own draftConvention (Cmd.  &quot;gp^), unless and until the other powers had r reached agreement.      If they should reach,agreement he, for his part, would be preparedto consider in a sympathetic spirit any proposals inthe matter of control.      He thought, therefore, thatthe Cabinet&apos;s answer to the points raised by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and to theFrench Government, should be to the effect that theyhad considered these matters in a sympathetic spirit;that they noted that there were still a number of points of difference outstanding between the Frenchand the Italian Governments;    that we should be gladnot only to see agreement reached on these points, butto do anything we could to promote such agreement;that we would like to be kept informed of what progreswas being made;      and that if agreement were reachedwe would be prepared to consider the proposals in a sympathetic spirit, provided that they did not damageany vital British interest.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thoughtit necessary to remind the Cabinet of the position.We had decided to ask the French Government what their proposals were in the matter of disarmament and theFrench Government had now made their position clear.It did not appear much use to say to them nYou mustagree with the Italians before we can express anyfurther views&quot;.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs pointedout that it was necessary to bear carefully in mind thedanger of the blame for failure being placed upon us.Even if the worst happened in the matter of the disarmament convention were we really in a bad position?       We could show by actual facts that we were the only nation that had made any real contribution to actual disarmament.We could^ show that we had been prepared to go as far asanyone else.       We had presented a complete picture ofthe disarmament we contemplated.       The Cabinet were notin possession of any complete picture of disarmament as contemplated by the French and Italian Governments.Our plan, therefore3  still held the field. We might say that we were prepared to consider any proposalsfor a complete convention that they might suggest.The President of the Board of Education pointedout by extracts from pages 8 and 9 of CP.  821 (33)that the French objections to point 6 of the Italianproposals referred to the grant to Germany ofprohibited weapons during the first rather than thesecond period of the Treaty.       It seemed important toknow whether the language used was not designed to leaveopen the possibility for the grant of some latitude toGermany after the first period of the Treaty had been
successfully accomplished.      If this were the casesupervision would seem to he the keystone of the Frenchplan.     He agreed that the Cabinet must not agree togeneralities and he shared the prime Ministers desire for precision in the language used to the French inthe matter of supervision, but he was impressed by whatthe Secretary of State for War had said on this point.We could not accept any new commitments, but he suggestedthat if the French and Italians could reach agreement onthe various points and if our objections to supervisionwere the only outstanding difficulty we could hardlystand out provided that our requirements were met asregards the form of supervision.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries suggestedthat much would turn on whether our reply were cast inan affirmative or a negative form.      The Government&apos;sadvisers in the Foreign Office and elsewhere- were constantly calling attention to the dangers of thepresent situation in Europe, and at their last meetingthe Cabinet had been engaged on this aspect of affairs.We could either indicate that we were impressed withthe dangers of the present European situation and were anxious to do all that we could to improve matters, orwe could convey the opposite impression that we were already disinteresting ourselves in the affairs ofEurope and that if we could not obtain a measure of disarmament we should disinterest ourselves further.He was apprehensive of a position arising like thatin 1914 when the two groups of Powers were both anxious that the United. Kingdom should come down on their side,and when, owing to our failure to declare ourselves,we had been accused of failure to prevent the Great War.
The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs raised the question as to whether this meant that we were toaccept a commitment.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries thought that .we could not remain as disinterested to-day as we could in June or July last.       He drew attention to M. Daladier1 question on page 4 of CP. 220(33) (already referred to)as to what degree of support he could rely on if thePermanent Disarmament Commission were to establishduring the first or second period that Germany hadviolated her obligations.        He thought we ought to he prepared to go rather further in answering this questionthan we would have done in June or July.      If this viewv/as taken it might involve a speech either by the primeMinister or the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.He recalled that the Secretary of State for Warss speechas to what  the position would be in the event of a violation of the Treaty of Versailles had produced considerable effect.&apos; The Prime Minister pointed out that the discussion had widened out%     he would be only too glad to givethe Cabinet an opportunity to discuss the question raisedby the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and he hopedthat before Parliament met the Cabinet might hold somemeetings without an Agenda Paper at which such matterscould be raised.       For the moment3 however  he thoughtit necessary to focus the discussion on the question ofthe acceptance of supervision.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat the Cabinet could not possibly decide in favour ofany further commitment.      If this point were raisedour reply must not be vague or indefinite.14.
The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs agreedthat if we gave any vague assurance we should exposeourselves to the whole &quot;blame for any catastrophe.The Prime Minister thought that the present position was not without its dangers.     M. Daladier seemed tohave made a statement in which he extended our obligations under the Treaty of Locarno.      For example, he quotedthe following from page 4 of CP, 220(33) -&quot;He observed that certain of the Germanpreparations, of which he had information,affected the Rhineland, and to that extentaffected the Treaty of Locarno,&quot;It was being said in France thatthe present German activities were a violation of the Treaty of Locarno, butthat nothing was being done about these violations,and how could France therefore be assured that any more serious notice would be taken of eventual German violations of the disarmament convention itself?&quot;If M. Daladier were in a position to turn upthe French record of any such statement without our being able to quote some statement that he was mis-interpreting the Locarno Treaty, the position mightbe-dangerous.The Secretary of State for the Colonies called attention to Mr. Eden*s undertaking to reportM. Daladier&apos;s remarks to his Government and his promise&quot;emphasise that what the French Governmentsought was some formula wherewith M. Daladiermight be able to re-assure French public opinion in regard to the attitude of the United kingdom in the conditions which he had outlined.&quot;This rather emphasised the importance of what the PrimeMinister had said.The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State forForeign Affairs said that in his view there had been no question of M. Daladier&apos;s asking for a new inter-pretation of the Locarno Treaty.     The French Prime15.
Minister- had only wanted to know what out attitude would he if the Disarmament Convention were broken^Possibly M. Daladier had hoped that we would proposeeconomic sanctions, but he had himself deliberatelyavoided pressing him on the point.
The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriespointed out that M.  Daladier had b een hound to put thesequestions in view of French public opinion.      Ifpublic opinion was not warned that the Governmentcould not guarantee ten years without war they would be just as justified in criticising the government as had been the case in relation to the Government beforethe &quot;War.      He felt that the Cabinet were bound to face the question as to what would happen if there were aflagrant violation of the Treaty.      If the Germansstarted to re-arm in a flagrant manner, it would appearto afford a casus belli. V,,The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs thought it was essential that the Cabinet should notseparate without reaching decisions on certain points.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsconceived that if a reply had to be given toMo Daladier&apos;s point, we should say that the question of whether Germany had violated an agreement or not wouldhave to be decided by some neutral body, namely,  thePermanent Disarmament Commission.      If that Commissionreported that Germany had violated the Treaty, then theother signatories would be discharged from their obligations.        That would be all.      There could be nofurther commitment on our part and he could not agreeto give any other answer.      In his view it would be fatal to give some vain encouragement to the French.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs thought that they would not expect any answer beyond that.The Prime Minister agreed.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairssummarised the attitude which he thought would fallin with the views expressed by the Secretary of State17.
for War and the Cabinet generally.      His proposal was to note that Prance and Italy were not yet in complete agreement and to indicate that if they could reach agree-ment and supervision was the only outstanding point,they must not assume that we should stand out on that point alone, provided that there was to he no rovingcommission and that the ohjeGt of the Disarmament Committeewas only to ascertain whether the Treaty had been observed.The First Lord said he could accept somethingon those lines.The Secretary of State for Air laid stress on the importance of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs&apos;  definition of supervision.The Prime Minister said that he could acceptsupervision and he had been informed that the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for India,both of whom were unable to be present, could alsoaccept it.     He repeated, however, that the words inwhich our acceptance was made must be carefully chosen.He thought that everyone agreed in principle with theline indicated by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.The Secretary of State for War and the FirstLord of the Admiralty agreed in the latter statementbut made clear that in doing so they did not acceptthe French proposals for supervision.
The Secretary of State for Foreign-Affairs&quot; &apos;then asked if he might assume that the Cabinet&apos;s viewson the various points raised were as follows:-(l)       It should be made clear to the French Governmentthat we could accept no new responsibilities in the matter of sanctions.      If, unhappily,some party to the Treaty, Germany for example,should disregard their obligations and thePermanent Disarmament Commission should makea finding to this effect, the other partiesto the Treaty would be absolved from their obligations but would not be involved insanctions.(3)       We were glad that the French aid italian governments were coming together on the questionof disarmament.      We observed, however, some differences which we hoped would be resolved.We would like to help in any possible way inresolving these difficulties and to be informed as to how matters stood.(3)        If France and Italy should reach agreement and supervision should prove to be the only out-standing point, we would not stand out onthat issue.      We must be assured, however,as to exactly what was intended.      There mustbe no roving commission, and the task of thePermanent Disarmament Commission must belimited to ensuring the carrying out of theConvention.The Cabinet turned first to the third of theabove tentative conclusions which was felt to requiremore precision.      In particular it was suggested thatwe must exercise the greatest caution, not only onthe question of supervision, but on the other points
in the Franco-Italian agreement since there were several    &apos;points in the Italian plan and the French comments thereonwhich were not   acceptable to us.      The Cabinet were givento understand that the points of difficulty were not limited to point 4 of the Italian plan to which theSecretary of State for War had already drawn attention.On supervision also we must be quite clear as to whatwas intended and should only express our willingness, ifthis were the only outstanding point, to consider theproposal sympathetically and wi th an anxious desire tofind a means of supervision acceptable to all.The First Lord of the Admiralty asked whetherthe points of difficulty in the Italian proposals and theFrench comments ought not to be examined.The Prime Minister pointed out that at themoment the Italian proposals and the French commentsthereon had only been communicated for information andnot submitted for our opinion.      Consequently, theCabinet were not dealing with these points to-day.The Prime Minister thought it essential that the cabinet should see the formula in writing before giving approval.(The Secretary of  State for War then started to draft a formula for the carrying out of the thirdpoint mentioned by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs).The Cabinet then turned to the first pointmentioned by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The Prime Minister suggested that the questionof our acceptance, if there were no new commitments,should be dealt with separately from the other points and should be separated from them in the cabinet conclusions.      Referring once more to M. Daladier&apos;observations on the connection between certain of theGerman preparations affecting the Rhineland and the Treatyof Locarno (CP.  220 (33) page 4), he thought the best planmight be for the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State
for Foreign Affairs to write a letter to M.. Daladier.-&apos;Mr.  Eden might point out that when transcrihing hisnotes of the conversation, he had found a passagewhich might he interpreted to mean that M.  Daladier&quot;believed that the alleged German activities in the Rhine-land were a violation of the Treaty of Locarnoinvolving the   obligations of the signatory Powers(Final Protocol of the Locarno Conference, Annex A,Article 4).       He realised that M, Daladier had not intended this, but he had felt it advisable to draw his attention to the matter as a precaution against any&apos; false deductions that might be drawn in the future fromany record of the conversations.       The Prime minister was apprehensive that if something was not placed on record some misunderstanding might arise in the future.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsdid not think that M. Daladier had intended to raise this point.      He had not said that the German preparationsbrought into operation the obligations of the locarno treaty, but merely that they affected the Treaty of locarno.      One way in which the matter could be dealtwith would be to link it on to the question of supervision and to say that the question of whether the disarmament convention was being properly observed was one thatwould have to be dealt with by the Permanent disarmament commission;    that if the Commission established a violation,  the other parties to the Treaty would beabsolved from their obligations under the Treaty andthat that was the sole obligation:- involved.The Prime Minister thought, nevertheless, thatthere was some risk that if no action were taken somemonths hence it might be suggested that the Parliamentary&apos; Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had tacitly
admitted that our obligations under the Treaty-fellunder the provisions of the Looarno Treaty.The Secretary of State for War at thispoint read the formula he had been drafting in respectof point (3) of the summary of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and, after a few amendments had beenmade,  this was accepted in the form contained inConclusion 2 below.      In the discussion on the formulait was decided to make no separate mention of theUnited States of America as being specially concernedwith ourselves in the question of supervision.
The Cabinet then reverted to their discussion on the question of   a possible breach of the DisarmamentTreaty.The Prime Minister asked whether if the-Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, said nothing about thematter M. Daladier was likely to ask &quot;What will youdo if the Convention is broken?&quot;The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State forForeign Affairs thought it was probable thatM. Daladier would raise the point, and reminded theCabinet of his promise to report M. Daladier1 s remarks to his GovernmentoThe Prime Minister was inclined not to make any statement to M. Daladier unless he asked for it.He doubted if the French Prime Minister expected an answer on the point.     Of course, if the matter was raised on our side he was bound to press it, but ifthis was not done he might leave it alone.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thoughtthat M. Daladier might say &quot;Supposing the supervisingCommission finds that the Treaty has not been observed,what will happen then?&quot;      The answer would be thatthe other parties to the Treaty would be absolvedfrom their obligations under the Treaty.      There must,however, be no ambiguous language.The Prime Minister thought it v/as important tokeep the two points of our attitude on supervision and our action^in - the:&apos; ejventi of a breach of the Treaty separate, even in the conclusions ofthe Cabineto They were not part of the sameuni f i e d de ci si on.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said hewas quite clear about the formula proposed by theSecretary of State for War and that in the event of a23.
6 Bbreach of the Treaty the signatory Powers would be discharged from their obligations, but that we shouldbe involved in no new sanctions.      He was not equallyclear, however, as to whether anything was to be done about the mention by M.  Daladier of the Locarno Treaties.He was now inclined to leave that matter alone.      Hethought M.  Daladier had brought it up by way of illustrationwith reference to past breaches of the Locarno treaty as explaining his anxiety for sanctions in the new agreement.The Prime Minister repeated his own apprehensionsas to the risk of leaving the matter without callingM.  Daladier&apos;s attention to it.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointedout that a statement that the Locarno Treaty had beenviolated was not the same as a statement that violationsbrought our commitments into operation.      The suggestedviolations would not necessarily be a casus belli, like a flagrant invasion by troops marching over the frontier.M., Daladier&apos;s remark that the reason German preparationsso far as they affected the Rhineland &quot;to that extentaffected the Treaty of Locarno&quot; was not the same as asuggestion that our full obligations were involvedthereby.The Prime Minister tbought it was better to leaveM.  Daladier under no possible misapprehensions, moreespecially from the point of view of future interpretationsof his remarks.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs suggestedthat a new French Cabinet dealing with the question might attach an interpretation which perhaps M. Daladier.
had not intended.The Prime Minister said that if he v/as the person in charge of these records he would, as a matter ofprecaution, send a Note.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggestedthat he should he given an opportunity to look intothe matter more closely and that the decision shouldhe left to  the Prime Minister himself.This was agreed to.The Secretary of State for Air raised the questionof whether the Cabinet should not discuss the Italianproposals and the Frensh reply. He pointed outthat further conversations in Paris must be basedon the Italian proposals since these were being discussed between the French and Italian Governments.      TheFrench and Italians had reached some rapprochementon these proposals but there was still a possibility that they might be unable to reach agreement on important details.        For example, there v/as theimportant question mentioned by the Secretary of Statefor War as to whether Germany v/as to be allowed some measure of re-armament.        If the French vetoed theItalian proposals there was to be no convention.   Weapparently were to use our good offices in promotingagreement.        Ought not the&quot; Cabinet, therefore,  to take some decisions on the various points at issue.The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State forForeign Affairs said that  the French and italian governments v/ere still negotiating and v/ere reportedto be making good progress^The prime Minister said that the Italian proposals were not  really before the British Government as yet,  .and we were not involved in the negotiations.      On the25.
question of some re-armament being allowed, to germany were we likely to disagree if Prance and Italy eachagree d?The Cabinet then briefly discussed the procedure.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said he had to proceed to Geneva on Friday and he was willingto anticipate Ms journey in order to continue the conversations in Paris.      He would like to be accompanied by the parliamentary Under Secretary ofState,/The Cabinet agreed -(a) that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, accompanied by the parliamentary under Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, should visit Paris on his wayto Geneva in order to continue the conversations with the French Government.(b) that in regard to  the disarmament position,his attitude should be as followsj-(l)    to welcome the fact that theFrench and Italian. governments had come together?    to note thatthe correspondence indicated some differences of opinion on details,and to express a hope that these would be resolved?    to indicatethat we should be glad to render any assistance in our power in securing agreement on any outstanding points,and that in any event we should like to be informed of the progressin negotiations,.j (2)    If it were found possible to adjust the differences, and if theonly barrier to a convention were on the question of supervision,the British Government would not regard this as necessarilyconstituting an insuperable obstacle,but would consider the proposal with an anxious desire of finding a means of supervision acceptable to all.    *--)J(c) that if M. Daladier should raise once more the question of what the position
would be in the event of a breach of theDisarmament Conventions the Secretary ofState should reply that if unhappilysome party to the Treaty, for exampleGermany, should disregard its obligations,the matter would have to be determined bythe Permanent Disarmament Commission.      if that Commission should find that theobligations had been disregarded the other parties would be absolved from their obligations.       He should make clear tothe French Government that we could acceptno new responsibilities in the matter of sanctions,( d)    that the question of whether any action shouldbe taken to safeguard our position in thefuture against any wrong interpretationbeing placed on M. Daladier&apos;s remarks onthe connection between certain of the alleged German war preparations affectingthe Rhineland and the obligations involvedin the Treaty of Locarno should be leftto the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs in consultation with the PrimeMinister.Note by the Secretary.In view of  the absence of several members ofthe Cabinet and of the importance of the subject,the Prime Minister authorised the Secretary to makea fuller record than usual of the above discussion.
MALTA.*  * * *Italianpropaganda.(previous reference cabinet 50(33)Conclusion 6).3.        The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Cabinet that the Governor of Malta considered it essential, in present circumstances, that he shouldhave control of the police.      Consequently anOrdinance to this effect would be issued at once.He added that many of the best Maltese were anxiousto revert to Crown Colony Government.The Cabinet took note of this information.29 Whitehall Gardens, S0f0lo,September 20th9 1933.

CP.  215  (55).From     FRANCE.Telegram (en clair) from Lord Tyrrell.    (Paris).D. September 18th. 1933.R.      September 19th,  1933.No. 219.    Saving.-----oOo-----Following from Mr, Eden:-His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador accompanied me to Qua! d&apos;0rsaythis morning when we had discussion with M. Paul-3oncour andwere joined in afternoon by M. Daladier.2.      M. Paul-Boncour referred at once to Italian proposa!and I informed him we had received text from Rome.       Hethereupon gave us text of reply French Government were re-turning (copy by bag).        They expect answer from ItalianGovernment to-morrow.3.      French reply was generally not unfavourable.French Government recognise that Italian Government havemade considerable advances towards French position and weencouraged French Ministers to pursue their efforts towardsFranco-Italian agreement.4.      This Italian- intervention may modify the situation to some extent, but I do not know what view His Majesty&apos;sGovernment take  of it.        These Italian proposals seem to afford better prospect of establishing Anglo-French-Italianaccord,    the importance of which was fully recognised by french Ministers and therefore deserves encouragement.    Mean-while both parties intend to keep us informed.The French Ministers stated that their position had not substantially altered since the June conversation.I said that I should then, I supposed, be right inreporting to His Majesty&apos;s Government that French position was/
was that, given a system of supervision acceptable to themand a trial period during which experience could be gained of its working, the French Government would undertake, inthe convention to make certain reductions during the secondperiod.      I said that until His Majesty&apos;s Government hadknowledge of what those reductions would be and until theywere fully cognisant of intentions of French Government on disarmament generally His Majesty&apos;s Government could not pro-nonnce upon French proposals in regard to supervision etc.We had no desire to press French Government but we were anxious for the fullest information they could give us.6.      M. Daladier said that he would agree that by theend of the second period all guns exceeding 155 mm,  shouldhave been disposed of.      The methods and stages of reduction would have to be agreed.      As regards tanks, he demurred tothe figure of 16 tons, and would prefer 30 tons, but suggested as an alternative a global tonnage limitation,  or possibly a limitation of the calibre of gun carried.      As regards air-craft,  French Government found it difficult to accept Britishplan as it stood:    it would involve too sudden and too large a reduction for France.      France would be prepared to reduceby o0% if the other principal air Powers did likewise.      I pointed out that v/e had already gone so far in reductionthat that would be unfair to us, and M. Daladier agreed thatthere would have to be adjustments for particular cases suchas our own, or perhaps the reduction might be made not from present figures but from figures at some earlier date.7.      Mo Daladier spoke as previously of handing overmaterial to the League, but was careful to explain that hewas fully prepared for the League to destroy it and thatthis formula was only intended to satisfy French publicopinion.
80 As regards effectives French are agreed that reduc-tion of period of service in all conscript armies should pro-ceed during  first period simultaneously with transformationof Reichswehr.      M. Daladier said that he was consideringthe possibility of making a declaration at Geneva on the re-sumption of the Conference concerning German re-armament, andM. Paul-Boncour added that if the German delegate made theusual speech about Germany having alone disarmed it might bedifficult to refrain from making such a declaration.      they asked the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government on this.    I saidthat I  would report their question but at first sight i thought it preferable if Franco-British-Italian accord couldfirst be reached on the future of the Conference to reservesuch retort against the eventuality of the Germans coraplain-ing that they had not been fairly treated.9. These French proposals constitute an advance indisarmament as compared with June last.     At the same timeM. Daladier expressed anxiety as to position which might be created were Germany to be proved by supervision to be re-arming.      &quot;While admitting that French and other signatorieswould then regain her freedom he said that this would hardly be enough.      He would like to be assured as to attitude his majesty&apos;s  jesty&apos;s Government might then be expected to adopt.      he appreciated our difficulty but thought that some formulamight be found which would help him to tranquilise french public opinion.French Ministers are anxious to resume conversations ifyou think fit to send me instructions here.
