B BRITISHvernmentsistancer theurchase ofe Codexinaiticus .(&apos;/ lit PcUWlftal&apos;tti fW1. mhe Chancellor of the Exchequer informed theCabinet that during the summer holidays he hadreceived a letter from the prime Minister to theeffect that a very valuable document, the CodexSinaiticus, was in the market, probably at a reason-able price.   This document had for long lain in theMonastery of   S.inai but had afterwards become theproperty of the Czar of Russia.   The Soviet Governmentwere now willing to sell.   Their first price wasroportod t o be  200,000, but 3rattre-rly they-h^dcxproonod o. willingness to part with it for  100,000in cash.    The Trustees of the British Museum wishedto purchase it, but only possessed  7,000, and had asked if the British Government would help. Therewere several precedents for assistance of this kind,and the Chancellor had replied to the Prime minister that so far as he was concerned he was willing torender assistance provided that the manuscript could he acquired for a sum that could be regarded as a reasonably good bargain,   -he Archbishop of Canterbury,who was of course greatly interested, and the trustees of the British Museum, had now all agreed that afterthe  7,000 available to them had been paid they wouldmake a public appeal, if the British Government wouldprovide pound for pound for what was contributedpublicly, up to a maximum of  100,000:    that is tosay, if the public provided their contribution of 43,000 to make up  50,000, the maximum which theGovernment could be asked to furnish would be  50,000.As yet, however, the Chancellor of the Exchequer didnot know whether this maximum would be reached,   fte-FPppoc10d to^make a statement in the House of Commons[the same day in reply to a Private Notice Question.-1-
In reply to a question as to what would happen ifthe public did not provide the  43,000, the PrimeMinister expressed the view that means must be foundto raise this sum.The Cabinet approved the actionof the Prime Minister and theChancellor of the Exchequer.
REDCT^TON and limitation of armaments.^he GermanI   proposals.(previous reference:Cabinet 69(33), Con-elusion 3.)3842. The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of Reduction and Limitationof Armaments:-A Despatch from the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs toMr Campbell (Paris), datedDecember 8, 1933   reportingconversations with the french ambassador in London on thesubject of instructions to theFrench Ambassador in Berlin inregard to the German disarmamentpropos als:A Report by the Ministerial Committeeon Disarmament (C,P.-308 (33)),dealing in particular with herr hitler&apos;s communication of December11th and submitting recommendations.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew the attention of the Cabinet to the statement in RerrHitler&quot;s document that -&quot;(a) Germany is the only State whichhas actually carried out thedisarmament obligations imposed in the Peace Treaty of Versailles&quot;.He stated that the draft instructions to Sir EricPhipps, which he had submitted to the ministerial committee on Disarmament, had contained the follow-ing:-&quot;(5) His Majesty&apos;s Government do not accept the Chancellor&apos;s declara-tion that Germany is the onlyState which has actually carriedout the disarmament obligationsimposed, in the Treaty of Versailles&quot;,The Ministerial Committee, however, had felt that itwas undesirable to enter into a polemic with theGerman Government on this question, and had decidedto omit the original paragraph (5) as quoted above.The Secretary of state had been considering thismatter and. rather regretted the decision.   herr hitler&apos;s note might be used as propaganda to theworld at large.   The fact that other statementscontained therein were challenged and that this one was not, might result in Herr Hitler claiming that statement (a) above was admitted as correct.-3-
This subject was discussed at some length,with the result that an alteration to the dr*vftDespatch to Sir Fric Phipps was approved in the terms set  forth below in Conclusion (a).The Cabinet agreed  (a) mo approve the instructions toSir Fric Phipps contained in annex II to CP.-308 (33)    subjectto a change in paragraph (4), whichshould run as follows :-&quot;As regards the three propositions(a),  (fc) and (c), Fis Majesty&apos;sGovernment do not dispute (c),but. cannot ag^ee to the implications-tions of (a) and (b) .    They would further remind the German Govern-ment that all countries represented at the Disarmament Conferenceaccepted as a basis the British draft Convention with its largemeasxj-re of disarmament, and ailthose countries except germany are ready to resume discussions atGeneva in January&quot;:(b) To approve        recommend at ion (S) of the ministerial Committee on disarmamentin C.P.-308 (33), that -&quot;The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should take advantage ofhis forthcoming visit to France andItaly to get in touch with the Frenchand Italian Governments in order to exchange views with them on the subjectof Herr Hitler&apos;s communication.    Someof the points which it is suggested the Secretary of State might at his discretion disctiss with these Govern-ments are set forth in Annex III.These are submitted for the approvalof the Cabinet, it being understoodthat the Secretary of State shouldhave the usual latitude in the conductof his conversations&quot;:(c) To take note of paragraph 3 of the Reportof the Ministerial Committee (CP.-308 (33))which deals with the issue in the notdistant future of some kind of manifestoto the worl^ setting forth the policyof His Majesty&apos;s Government.(NOTE: The Prime Minister and the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs invited their colleagues to study the preliminary draftmanifesto in Annex IV to C .P..-308 &quot;(33).)
pALESmINE.t^he Use ofrpear Gas fordispersingMods .(previous reference:Cabinet 48(33), Con-elusion 11.)3,   The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda by the Secretary of State for the Colonies:-CP.-301 (33)  circulating a despatch from the High Commissioner for palestine in which the latter recommended thaton humanitarian grounds the use ofTear Gas by the Police Force inPalestine, for^the purpose.of avoidingcasualties xn dispersing illegalassemblies and riotous crowds, shouldbe permitted:C.P.-301A (33) pointing out that article 54 of the British Draft ofthe Disarmament Convention, which hadbeen amended specially to meet thepoint of view of the United StatesGovernment, who rely very largely ontear gas for Police purposes, completelysafeguarded the position.The Secretary of State for the Colonies made astatement amplifying his Memorandum.In the course of the discussion it was mentioned that the use of tear gas in Calcutta had been rejectedon the advice of Sir Charles Teg^art, on the ground of the danger of a stampede of a mob, with the riskof individuals being trampled to death.The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointedout in this connection that the High Commissioner inPalestine and the Chief of the Police were bothexceptionally wise and experienced administratorsand that the Police had shown themselves to be areliable force.AdAr- suggest ^oa- was made that- as the use of tear gasraised very serious issues it would be desirablethat the Cabinet should be given in the near future a full report on the position in Palestine, covering,inter alia, the present position on the followingpoints:-   the restriction on the sale of Arab landsto Jews:    the proposed Loan;    the proposals for theformation of a Legislative Council.
The Secretary of State for the Colonies saidp^ that he would gladly 843?-QAA4a. 4i-^ on13(5^13. retlirn^   He added that he had arranged thatduring his forthcoming journey to the African colonies the High Commissioner for Palestine should meet him in Cairo.The Prime Minister expressed some doubts as tothe after-effect of the vise of tear gas, not physicallybut morally, on people of the temperament of the Arabs,who might well regard the use of this weapon asungentlemanly, as Indian frontier tribesmen weresometimes reported to regard air bombing.    This mightbuild up a store of trouble.The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointedout, however, that when people were killed by riflefire the event was apt to be celebrated in theMosques as &quot;martyrdom&quot; and. given a day.    This couldnot happen in the case of the use of tear gas, which left no after-effects .    He anticipated, that some time would be required to obtain the tear gas and make arrangements for its use, and it was hardly likelyto be available for the troubles that were anticipated in mid-January.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should authorise the HighCommissioner of Palestine to use teargas in dealing with mobs and riotsin cases where it would otherwise benecessary to shoot:(b) That at his forthcoming meeting in cairo the Secretary of State for theColonies should instruct the HighCommissioner to send home a Despatchexplaining how he proposed to obtaintear gas, to train the Police personnel in its use, and the proposed methods ofits employment;    but it should be under-stood that in the event of troubles inPalestine in mid-January the HighCommissioner should be authorised touse tear gas if he could obtain it andhis arrangements were sufficiently advanced.(The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Airwithdrew at this point.)
;ERSIA.previous;:ef erence:Cabinet 68(-83), Con-elusion 3.)4. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C .P.-297(33)) containing an account of a conversation hehad had. with Sir John 0adman on the question of ourrelations with Persia.    Sir John Cadman had expressedwillingness to make any contribution he could, towardsthe improvement of our relations with Persia.   the shah would not see any foreign diplomat, andSir John Cadman had made the unconventional suggestionthat the only way to secure a satisfactory agreementwith Persia v/as by direct negotiation between the shah himself and. some Plenipotentiary other than theaccredited diplomatic representative.    EventuallySir John Cadman had said that he attached, so much importance to bringing about, promptly better rela-tions on a permanent footing with Persia that hewoxild not refuse to act in this  capacity if such a choice seemed practicable and. desirable.   An alterna-tive name mentioned had been that of Sir FrancisHumphrys, who was favourably regarded in Tehran.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the Cabinet that as the result of further comrounica-tions Sir John Cadman had indicated that he no longerconsidered, himself as the right person to negotiate,though he had adhered to a proposal, reported inC.P.-S97 (33), that the Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs might with advantage beused as a negotiator.It was suggested, however, that it would not be advisable that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary ofState should undertake this mission.    If he did soit would add tremendously to the prestige of the Shahof Persia.   Moreover, the Under-Secretary would havea very difficult hand to play, and could hardly hope
to achieve success.   A failure on the part of aBritish Minister would be unfortunate: yet, in orderto avoid failure, he might have to make some consider-able concession.   The proposal met with no support.The Cabinet were reminded that the alternative tosome agreement with Persia might well be that thePersian Government would bring vis before the Leagueof Nations, possibly in connection with the recentincident at Basidu.    Prior to that incident the Shahhad been rather well-disposed towards this country,was placing orders here, and giving some signs ofa disposition to substitute British for Italianinfluence in the Persian Navy.    The arrest of theMudir, however, had completely upset him.Among other suggestions was one that if. and whenthe Shah visits Baghdad advantage might be taken ofthe occasion to use Sir Francis Humphrys as a negotia-tor.    A second suggestion was that the Shah, if andwhen he visits Switzerland, might be invited to cometo this country, where negotiations might be undertaken with the assistance of experts summoned home for thepurpos e,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointedout that in any event there would probably have to bea period of preparation by our diplomatic representa-tive in -ehran.    If a special Plenipotentiary were appointed it would probably be to clinch the final stages.   He had just heard that the British Ministerat Tehran had had a personal interview with the Shahon the previous day.   He had not learned the result,which might have a bearing on the question.   He thought,therefore, the question might be allowed to stand over,at any rate until the receipt of the British Ministersreport.   After that he himself might like to discuss-8-
the matter with some of his colleagues before againconsulting the Cabinet.The Prime Minister reminded, the Secretary ofState .for Foreign Affairs that the Middle East(Ministerial) Committee could provide the necessary facilities for conference among the ministers concerned.&quot;Tie Cabinet agreed.  That the question should, be placed onthe Agenda Paper for their first regularMeeting in the New Year.
GERMAN COMPE-* IT TON IN THECOAL TRADEWITH ImALY,(previous reference:Cabinet 68(33), Con-clusion 8.)53.(3.*) 6.5. The Cabinet had before them the following docu-ments relating to German Competition in the coal trade with Italy:-A Despatch from His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Rome to the Secretary of State fcrForeign Affairs (CP.-280 (33)), whichhad been under consideration at theMeeting referred to in the margin:A Memorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade (CP.-290 (33)) asking the authority of his colleagues(!) to discuss the coal situation with the Italian Ambassador: and(2) to offer to undertake that theexisting duty on Italian workedmarble shall not be increased, should it appear that such an offer would secure the maintenance at its presentdimensions of our coal exports toItaly.The Chancellor of the Exchequer mentioned thatthe marble-workers in this country had made anapplication for an increased tariff to the ImportsAdvisory Committee, which had recommended an increase from 10% to 20%.    He thought the Cabinet ought to be aware of this, although he supported the Presidentof the Board of trade&apos;s proposal.The Secretary of State for Scotland, whilesupporting the President of the Board of Trade,warned the Cabinet that the proposal might producesome reaction among the Aberdeen granite-workers.The Prime Minister pointed out that there mustbe some co-ordination in these matters in the national interest by methods such as that   proposed by thePresident of the Board of Trade.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the President, of the Board of trade as stated in C.P.-290 (33) and summarised above.
COMMERCIALNEGOTIATIONSWIT? FOREIGNCOUNTRIES.Duties onDutch Vege-tables andFlowers .i mmDutch Ordersfor UnitedKingdom Steel(previous reference:Cabinet 4S(33), Con-elusion 9 .)6. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe President of the Board of Trade (C.P.-304 (33))on the subject of the Duties on Dutch Vegetablesand Flowers, at the end of which he recommended,  inview of the prospect of further orders for steel from Holland, reductions of Duty as set out in Annex IIto the Memorandum.While no opposition was raised to the Presidentof the Board of Trade&apos;s proposals, the Cabinet, were asked to be careful as to the extent to which inroads&quot;-ere made into the horticultural industry.    It was important not to undermine the confidence of vegetableand flower growers either in the Government or in theImports Advisory Committee.-he Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries did not oppose the proposal, which he recognised *as ofadvantage to the trade of the country, but he warned the Cabinet that there would, soon be coming requestsfrom Spain for special treatment in respect of potatoes,and the larger question of the French grievances.It miffht perhaps be of advartage if such matterscould be dealt with in a general Trade Agreement, buthe had every confidence in the President of the Boardof Trade&apos;s handling of such questions the Cabinet, approved, the proposals ofthe President of the Board of trade as set forth in C.P.-304 (33) for reductions of duty on cauliflowers andbroccoli, certain cut flowers andplants in flower, as set forth in annex TI to CP.-304 (33).
RUBBERRESmRTC-tTONS .(previous reference:Cabinet 16(38), Con-elusion 10.)c\(3k)Lf7. The Secretary of State for the Colonies madea statement to the Cabinet on the subject of the rubber Restrictions negotiations, in case matters should come to a head during his absence.   Thenegotiations had taken place between producers,  .        -   ^namely, a representative British Committee, aa 0        Dassociated Committees in Malaya and Ceylon, while- and dutch and French producers, had .a 1 s-o. be^ft-geff^es-e-nkad..There had been contact with Worth Borneo, which had alsorecently been established with Sarawak and was hoped for with Siam.   He had. discussed the draft schemeresulting from the negotiations very thoroughlywith Mr Caldecott, the Ac44wgr Chief Secretary ofthe Federated Malay States, and was satisfied thatit was administratively practicable in british territories.   The scheme would cover both exportproduction and planting, and re-planting, and wouldfulfil all the conditions laid down at the world conference.   The crux of the question was theDutch native production, as to which no plan had as yet been produced.   He had insisted that the scheme must come from the producers&apos; organisations as a generally agreed plan considered by them to be sound and practicable.   There would have to be an inter-national Management Committee, but authority must restin the Government representatives, aided by the best possible technical assistance.   Consumers would notbe entitled to claim an unremunerative price.   Hehad not been able to agree with the proposal ofimportant producer-consumers that they should have  ..preferential treatment.    If a satisfactory schemewas produced and put forward by the great majorityof the producers we ought to go ahead, with it.-IS-
In the course of a short discussion hopes were expressed that the Cabinet would not be asked totake a decision that day and without an opportunityfor fuller examination of details.A suggestion was made that the Foreign Officemight invite the opinion of the Consul-General atBatavia as to whether the Dutch would in fact be ableto carry out any scheme which was entered into onbehalf of the native producers .-he Secretary of State -for the Colonies said he had put the responsibility as to deciding thaton to our own producers, who were well aware of conditions in the Dutch Colonies, but he also hadassurances from M. Coliin, the Dutch Prime Minister,that he would not put forward a scheme that could notbe worked,   -he only outstanding point was the Dutchplan for the native growers .-he Cabinet took note of the statementof the Secretary of State for theColonies, and expressed the hope thatit would not be necessary to ask themfor a decision on the matter until his return from his visit to Africa.
FALKLAND 8.     mhe Cabinet had under consideration a MemorandumMDS DEPEND- n nnCIE? RESEARCH by the Secretary of State for the Colonies lC0P.-295DFVELOP-rp puND . (3.?))  on the subject of the Falkland Islands Depend-pi^ encies Research and Development Fund, which Lad1713k)?.       financed a series of investigations carried out bythe &quot;Discovery&quot; Committee in accordance with therecommendations contained in the Report of an Inter-Departmental Committee published in 1920 (Cmd.657).The charges on the Fund were now exceeding   itsincome, and a deficiency of  5,000 was anticipatedfor the year 19 53 in the yield of revenue from the dependencies,   Questions therefore arose as tosetting aside part of the Fund as a reserve for purely Dependencies expenditure, and as to whether some part of the Fund could not advantageously bemade available for other research work which mightbe expected to produce scientific results of greater importance to the Empire as a whole.   On this latter question the Secretary of State had consulted the LawOfficers of the Crown, whose Reference and report were attached as Appendices &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; respectively to the Memorandxim.     The Secretary of State summed up his proposal as follows:-   to allot (l)  125,000 forthe completion of the &quot;Discovery&quot; investigations:(2)  135,000 for the future needs of the Dependencies:(3)  100,000 for a new Reserve Fund:   and added thatthe Argentine challenge to British rights over the falkland Islands and the Dependencies afforded an argument against allowing all signs of british administration to disappear from the Dependencies.
The Cabinet took note that/a sum of 125,000 was alroady allotfo&amp;d- for thecompletion of the &quot;Discovery&apos;1 investigation and agreed to postpone the other questions raised in CP.  295 (33) until after the recess.
&quot;CVBRKMENTBUSINESS.0      0       cHouse of Lords,THE NEWFOUNDLANDBILL.THE agricultural marketing BILL.(previous previous reference:Cabinet 69 (33)Conclusion 2. )9. The Secretary of State for War, as leader of the House of Lords, reported thathe had managed to make arrangements for the passageof the two Bills mentioned in the margin throughthe House of Lords.      At one moment, however, hisprogramme had been upset and success jeopardisedby the receipt of information in the House of Lordsthat an announcement had been made in the House ofCommons to the effect that aiamendment was comingtothat House from the Lords.      He asked thatannouncements of this kind should not be madein the House of Commons without a prior communication to the Minister concerned in the House of Lords.The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs explained that he had been under theimpression that the Secretary of State for War hadbeen notified through the usual channels.      Hehad had to make this announcement at rather short notice,

THE SHOPSBILL..previous reference:Cabinet 69 (33)Conclusion 7. )11.       The Cabinet had before them a revisedMemorandum by the Home Secretary (CP. 303 (33))on the Shops Bill, consideration of which had been postponed at the Meeting referred to in the margin.The Home Secretary&apos;s revised recommendation was thatthe hours of employment for young persons should befixed at a weekly maximum of 48, with a yearlyallowance of 50 hours overtime,  subject to aprovision allowing a weekly maximum of 52 with a yearlyallowance of 24 hours overtime for a period of twoyears from the commencement of the new Act.The Minister of Labour supported theproposals of the Home Secretary on the subjectof hours of employment for young persons, but warned the Cabinet that criticism v/as likely to arise not so much on the period of adjustment prior to theintroduction of the weekly maximum of 48 hours ason the limited classes of persons to which the Billapplied.The Home Secretary said he would includeas many classes as possible.

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Transport (CP.-296 (33)) setting forth the grounds of his objections to the two following Bills:-(l) The Road Traffic (Compensation forAccidents) Bill, to be reintroducedby Lord Panesfort, the main feature of which was the provision that wherebodily injury (including fatal injury)to a person &quot;is caused by or arisesout o-f the use of a motor vehicle ona road or place to which the public have the ri^ht of access&quot; damages shallbe recoverable from the owner of the motor vehicle except where the injurywas solely due to the negligence ofthe injured person.(2) The Road Traffic (Emergency Treatment)Bill, introduced by Lord Moynihan,which provided that a medical prac-titloner or a hospital that rendersfirst-aid treatment to a person injuredin a motor accident shall be entitledto recover as remuneration from theowner of any motor vehicle involvedin the accident, or his personal representative, a fee of twelve shillingsand sixpence, and in addition the sumof sixpense for every mile or part ofa mile in excess of two miles which a medical practitioner has had to coverin order to treat the injured person.Apart from the is sties raised in these two Bills,the Memorandum stated that the Minister of transport was considering the possibility of amending Part ii of the Road Traffic Act, 1930, in respect of compul-sory insurance against third party risks, particularly with a view to providing that where the motoristhimself is killed or dies in the period between an accident and the settlement of any claim arisingout of the accident, proceedings for the recovery of damages arising out of the accident should not thereby be invalidated.
The Cabinet agreed:-(a) That as the Road Traffic (Compensationfor Accidents) Bill could not be againintroduaed by Lord Danesfort until afterthe recess, the question should be postponed until a later meeting.(b) That as regards the Road Traffic (EmergencyTreatment) Bill introduced by LordMoynihan, the Minister of Transport should deal with the matter in a memorandum on road accidents which he informed the Cabinethe proposed shortly to circulate.(c) That the proposed - amendments to Part ii of the Road Traffic Act, 1950, should alsobe dealt with in the memorandum referred toabove in (b).

THE LIVESTOCK SITUATIONStatement  by  the  Minister of Agriculture  and Fisheries in theHouse of Commons on Wednesday, December 20, 1933.The Government have had under consideration the position ofthe beef industry in this country. Notwithstanding the efforts that have been made since November 1932 to hold and improve thesituation on the wholesale meat market, the returns from the feeding of cattle have continued unsatisfactory. Many UnitedKingdom feeders have kept back their stock from sale owing to thelow level of prices, while supplies from other sources have been pressed on the market. The number of home-produced fat cattlemarketed this summer and autumn has thus been less than in thecorresponding period last year. The supplies held back are likely,however, to come forward at an early date, so that the immediate problem is now that of averting a further price decline as well as of bringing about an improvement in the situation.In these circumstances, it is essential to afford some relief to themarket in respect of the supplies of cattle imported for immediateslaughter.At present such cattle are imported into the United kingdom from two sources only, namely, the Irish Free State and Canada.As regards the Irish Free State, an Order will be issued forthwithunder the Agricultural Marketing Act, 1933, under which it is intendedto limit the imports of fat cattle from the Irish Free State from now tothe 31st March next to 50 per cent, of the numbers imported in thecorresponding period of 1932-33. As a complementary measure,it is also intended, under the Order to limit the number of storesthat may be imported from the Irish Free State. In terms of totalcattle imports from that source, the reduction will be in theneighbourhood of 12^ per cent.* The Order, also as a complementarymeasure, will prohibit the importation of beef and veal and beef andveal offals from the Irish Free State.As regards the Dominion of Canada, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin that Dominion have been asked to co-operate by stabilising exportsof cattle, both fat and store, to this market for the first quarter of1934 at the corresponding figures of the first quarter of 1933.t I am glad to say that they have agreed to do so, and we thank them mostheartily for their readiness to meet us.Imports of foreign canned beef are dutiable, but, as in the caseof imports of fat cattle, they have hitherto been unregulated. Theywill now be brought under control, and arrangements are being madeto limit the supplies coining forward next quarter.!* Statement A. t Statement B. J Statement C.

Finally, negotiations are proceeding with a view to readjusting the proportions of bonedand boneless beef imported from foreign countries under thisdesignation.The Government have also had under consideration the situationin the bacon market, taking into account the large expansion in homebacon production attained within the last few months, and havedecided that, if the step is justified by the number of pig-contractsentered into by home producers for the period beginning the1st March and ending on the 31st December next, due allowancebeing made for Northern Ireland production, they will be prepared toreduce imports from foreign countries by a further 7 per cent, on the1st March and by an additional 8 per cent, on the 1st June, makinga total reduction on the present rate of importation of 10 per cent, on and from the 1st June, 1934.

APPENDIX    II.SLUM CLEARANCE AND HOUSING.Observations of the Minister of Health.The Minister of Health said that the cabinet should have an account of the action taken earlier in theweek in the case of 11 towns in the matter of the slum clearance campaign.There were 1,717 housing authorities.      In thecase of some 300 he was considering the adequacy ofthe programmes submitted.      In the 11 towns in question,he had ordered an inquiry into the local housing conditions to be held forthwith.     These towns wereamongst the most considerable of those as to whoseprogrammes he was not yet satisfied.      The information to be derived from a public local inquiry was necessaryin order that he might come to a judgment on their cases.Holding aa   inquiry was not defaulting the towns.      It was,on the other hand, a condition precedent to a default.It might be that an inquiry would have to be held insome further towns.-     He hoped, on the other hand, thatthe action taken might prevent the necessity either ofdefaulting the towns concerned or of holding inquiriesinto further cases.He proposed Immediately after Christina a to lay before the Cabinet a memorandum on the housing question.The occasion for it was double.      The work of clearing slumshaving got under way, it was now necessary to proceed withthe next part of the work - the prevention of the creationof fresh slums by promoting the work of reconditioningand, in connection with it, providing for better management of publicly owned..housing estates.      Legislation was necessary
for the purpose, which had already been announced in theKing&apos;s Speech.      The second occasion was that they wereapproaching a turning point in the housing position.At present they were relying for the provision of smallhouses to let to the manual workers on the stimulus to private enterprise given by the abolition of thecompetition of building under general subsidy and on thesubsidised building of small houses to let by the housing authorities under the overlap powers of the Act of 1933.There were some 35,000 houses still to be built under these powers, but these should be finished towards the middleof next year.     That would make something of a turningpoint in the housing position, and the line of action tobe followed, in view of the general housing position, mustbe considered and decided upon in good time before theturning point arrived.      The question of the total supplyof small houses to let came home in the matter of over-crowding, and he proposed to deal with this position ingeneral in the memorandum referred to.
fRET. APPENDIX III.PRIVATE ARMAMENTS INDUSTRY.On the assumption that it is decided to reconsider thedecision reached on December 13th, to issue to approvedfirms open licences for the export of war material (Cabinet 69(33) Conclusion 6) the Ministers mainly concerned have agreedto submit to the Cabinet the following alternative proposalswhich represent in their view the bare minimum which will beof any value in allaying the uncertainty at present existing in the minds of prospective customers of the British armament industry.The new proposal,  if approved   by the Cabinet, should begiven a three month&apos;s trial;   if at the end of that period thearrangements are found not to have worked satisfactorily thequestion of adopting the &apos;open licence&apos; system should beagain considered.Procedure.when an approved firm receives information that a foreign Government.   .   .,        ,     n licence byis m the market for a specific transaction the firm will be granted a  the Board of Trade and an assurance will be given that thelicence will not be revoked save in very exceptional circum-stances.In order that there may be no loss of time in the granting of the licences-be(a) special arrangements wlll^made by the Foreign office which will ensure that in ordinary circumstances there will be no delay in communicating theconsent of that Department to the Board of Trade.(b) it will not be necessary (as at present) for theBoard of Trade to consult the Service department concerned before the licence is granted, but that department will always be notified at the timethe licence is actually granted.
In order to give effect to the proposed arrangements the following alterations will he made in the Form of licence for approved firmsDelete the proviso that the licence is validonly for three months.Delete the proviso that the Board of Trade mayrevoke or modify the licence at any time.Insert;    The conditions under which this licenceis granted are set forth below (viz -):-&quot;This licence is granted only for the exportof war material tc such foreign Governments (or their accredited agents) as are recognised byH.M. Government with the exception of the Govern-ments of Abyssinia, Germany, Austria, Hungary and bulgaria to which countries the supply of warmaterial is precluded by Treaty.     The licence maybe modified or revoked at any time by the Board ofTrade (a) if the foregoing condition is notfulfilled!    (b) in the interests of Imperialsecurity;    or (c) in pursuance of an international agreement to which His Majesty&apos;s Government areor may become a party.&quot;Action to inform approved firms.It will be necessary that the approximately^roved firms (after they have been selected) should be given an assurance inadvance that licences on the above terms will be granted tothem and that  they should be allowed to acquaint theirprospective customers (either direct or through their accreditedagents).      The Departments concerned might explain to firms verballythe more elastic procedure to be adopted in future in their case, reminding them that as there is only a limited numberof firms to whom this privilege is granted they should usediscretion as regards the method of imparting the information to their prospective customers.Action if procedure is questioned.In due course the new arrangements may be expected tobecome public and enquiries must be answered.      The answermight , it is thought, take the form that H.M. Government
have decided to define more closely the manner in which they intend to exercise control over the export of armaments infuture.     The new and old forms of licence should he quoted in extenso.     The new form of licence applies at present only to selected firms.      The policy of H.M. Governmentremains unaltered so far as Geneva is concerned, vizj- to seek international agreement to reach a position in which theexport of arms from all countries will be regulated byidentical measures.Notification to Foreign Governments.If it is thought desirable for x-&apos;political reasons that foreign Governments should be notified of the proposed changeit is suggested that it be done informally and unobtrusively,and in such a way as to minimise the importance attached tothe matter.     H.M. Representatives abroad should be instructedto take some opportunity when they are discussing some othertopic with the Foreign Ministers concerned to point out thatthe policy which H.M. Government have consistently advocatedregarding the adoption of national systems for licensingthe export of arms and ammunition has failed to produce any res-ponse and to draw attention to certain results of this failureincluding the fact that the restrictions which operate inthis country alone not only do not check the total volume ofthe traffic in arms but allow the foreign competitors of ourarmaments industry to increase and profit at the expense ofemployment in this country.H.M. Representatives will make their oral communications in such.a form as will not call for any reply but at the sametime will give us a good answer to any foreign critic who may(D accuse&apos;   Us of changing our arrangements without notice.Whitehall Gardens, S.w.1.December 20th, 1933.
