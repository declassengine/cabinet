In the course of the Meeting the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs drew attentionto a telegram from Geneva (No.344 L.N.)in which Mr Eden reported that Mr NormanDavis had shown him a rough draft of proposals following broadly the line ofthose attached to CP.-228 (33) whichmight form the basis of an offer by theAmerican, French, United Kingdom andpossibly Italian Governments to Germany.Mr Eden stated that he felt confident that a demand that some such offer shouldbe made would grow in the next day or two and that it was most likely to be&apos; effective if it could be made jointly by the four powers mentioned above.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs impressed on the Cabinet that since C .P.-228 (33) with the pro-posed &quot;Compromise&quot; had been circtilated, an important new factor had been brought into the situation by astatement made to him by the German Charge dTAffaires(C.P.-229 (33)).   The more important points of this statement were,  first, that &quot;Germany cannot accept theperiod of probation&quot;, and, second, that in the matterof those weapons which in the Convention would neitherbe prohibited nor numerically limited, Germany, so farfrom limiting herself to a request for samples, demandedthat &quot;if the possession of stich arms by others was without numerical limit, no numerical limit could beapplied to G-ermany&quot;;    that is to say, naked re-armament.     Prince Bismarck&apos;s statement had so altered the situation at Geneva that the Secretary of Statefelt it necessary to ask for considerable latitude fromthe Cabinet in his handling of the situation there.Prince Bismarck&apos;s proposals were generally agreedto be completely unacceptable by the Cabinet.    It wasnoted that France could not possibly accept them, andthat Signer Suvich,  on behalf of the Italian ForeignOffice, had stated that he &quot;could, not imagine France   .or Great Britain or, indeed, Italy, entertaining anythinof the kind&quot;.
&apos; ... 80Among the suggestions that were made for dealingwith the situation were the following:-FIRST PROPOSAL.That it would he preferable to allow Germany tohave &quot;samples&quot; of prohibited weapons rather than thatshe should go out of the Conference and re-arm, which appeared to lead the Powers to a dilemma between apreventive war or war with Germany when she was armed.The Cabinet felt,, however, that, apart from the strong objections that would be raised in this country,France could never grant samples.    As the French wellknew, the samples were required as part of the plans for mass production and the re-armament of Germany,and would facilitate evasion of the Convention.SECOND PROPOSAL.That at Geneva the Secretary of State for Foreign   -Affairs should state that we had thought at one timeof putting forward amendments to the British DraftConvention on the basis of a middle course betweenconflicting views, but that in the course of the recentconversations two points of principle had emerged, viz.,(I) That there must be a period of trial and waitingbefore the complete scheme came into operation:    and(ii)  that there must be no re-armament:    that he hadbeen led to understand that the German Governmentwould accept neither of these principles:    and that heshould then ask point-blank whether that was theposition of the German Government.   This course, itwas urged, would bring the Germans out into the open.This plan was not rejected if at Geneva theSecretary of State should deem it desirable to adopt it,but doubts were expressed as to whether the Secretaryof State was at liberty to quote publicly what PrinceBismarck had said to him at the Foreign Office.-3-
m   -The Secretary of State, however, said he might perhapsfind some way of achieving the desired result, e.g.,by stating that  &quot;In view of what was said to me bythe German Charge&apos; d&apos;Affaires in London I was expectingto hear what is the German attitude&quot;.Another suggestion was that he might introduce the subject.by saying &quot;Unless I am misinformed, theGerman position is&quot; so-and-so, which would bring theGermans into the open.THIRD PROPOSAL.mhe Prime Minister suggested that, in view of thevery grave issues for the future that might arise outof the events of the present week, it would be desirableto give a warning to Germany of which a record couldbe published later, if and when Papers were laid.With this end it was suggested that the Secretaryof State should make our position to Germany clearnow.   He might rehearse many matters in which germany had received assistance from o\tr good offices inrecent years, and make clear that if the German nationwished a continuance of these relations it was essentialthat they should not upset the Disarmament Conferenceat Geneva or take any action to encourage or strengthen the possibility of war.   The strength of public opinion in this country, and of Cabinet   opinion, under this plan would be impressed on the German Governmentobjectively and without threats, except that it mightbe intimated that a refusal on Germany1s part toco-operate in disarmament might compel us to declareour attitude openly during the coming meetings atGeneva .The main criticism, of this third.plan was that weshould be revealing our intentions to the Germans, who might find means to forestall us, and thus avoidhaving to face up to the situation at Geneva, e.g., by-4-
representations at Rome to induce the Italian Govern-ment to persuade us to desist.    It was pointed outalso that the Lord. President&apos;s speech at Birminghamon Friday, October 6th, had, abroad as well as at home,been interpreted as a warning to Germany.    It was -further suggested that there was some danger in warnings unless we knew our mihds in case those warnings weredisregarded and Germany re-armed   but the Cabinetdid not wish to pursue that aspect at this Meeting.In reply to these observations the Prime minister pointed out that it was worth risking tricks on thepart of the Germans in order to make sure that our policy was made perfectly plain to them and that our minds and consciences were clear. As the discussionproceeded the proposal commended itself more and more to the Cabinet.    It was urged, however, that thestatement, even though made verbally, should be accompanied by a written   Memorandum or Aide-memoiresetting out in full the case why Germany should sign aConvention on the lines now proposed and not putforward the proposals indicated by the Charge d&apos;Affaires.-The qu.estion was then discussed as to whether a communication should be made at the same time to theFrench and Italian Governments.    The objection to thisprematurecourse was the risk of/publicity,   but, on the otherhand, our admirable existing relations with the Frenchmight be disturbed to some extent if they heard ofthese representations first from other quarters.On the whole, therefore, the Cabinet felt that if theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs decided to makea statement to Germany, the French and Italian Govern-ments should shortly afterwards be informed.
The Secretary of State saw no difficulty in thematter of procedure.   The German Charge d&apos;Affaireshad come to make a preliminary statement, and he had replied that he would &quot;of course first wish to studys it carefully&quot;.   He therefore saw no difficulty inor Ambassador, sif back, sending again for the Charge d&apos;Affaires;    informing him that the Cabinet had been considering these ques-tions;    pointing out that his statement went much further than Baron Neurath had hitherto led us to expect;   recalling the assistance we had given toGermany in recent years;    warning him that if theGerman Government wished a continuance of our good offices they must not take any action calculated to destroy the Disarmament Convention or to threaten peace;and stating that if Ithe German demands remainedunqualified it might be his duty in the coming week to state their nature   publicly at Geneva.   Whileinclined favourably to the proposal, he asked for timeto consider it and to draft a communication to theGerman Charge d&apos;Affaires, which he might show to oneor two of his colleagues before taking a decision.The Cabinet registered no decision, but left theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in consultationwith the Prime Minister, to use his judgment, in thelight of the Cabinet discussion, as to the action heshould take, either in London (Proposal 3 above) orin Geneva (Proposal 2 above)  or in both places.(The discussion of the Annex to cp.-228 (33) is dealt with in a subsequent; Minute.)
REDUCTION and limitation of armaments.ProposedAmendmentsto the DraftConvention.2. After their discussion on general policy as summarised in the preceding Conclusion, the cabinet discussed the Annex to C.P.-228 (3?).   The heading ofthis Annex, viz.,  &quot;The Compromise&quot;, did not commend itself to the Cabinet as suitable for use at Geneva.The Prime Minister suggested that some reference might be made to the Declaration dated December 11,19 32, in which the Government of Germany, in conjunc-tion with the Governments of the United Kingdom, france and  Italy, stated that they were &quot;ready to join in a&quot;solemn reaffirmation to be made by all european states that they will not in any circumstances attempt&quot;to resolve any present or future differences between&quot;the signatories by resort to force&quot;.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out, however, that many nations had insistedat the Disarmament Conference that the declaration should be extended to all signatories of the Disarma-ment Convention.The Prime Minister observed that that extensionwould, deprive it of all effectiveness .Articles (3) and (4).Following up a suggestion that, had been made inthe discussion summarised in Conclusion 1, theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook toconsider a re-draft of these Articles.    In order torender them more acceptable to the German Delegationhe would try to lay less emphasis on the division ofthe proposed Convention into two periods.Article (4)(b) .secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that the War Office had suggested,the following re-draft:-&quot;No signatory shall possess tanksexceeding. 30 tons in weight .   For eachHigh Contracting Party the global tonnage-7-
of tanks over 16 tons and under 30 tonsshall not exceed the figure for eachHigh Contracting Party in the annexedtable. &quot;This matter was left to the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs in consultation withrepresentatives of the Foreign Office and War office in London and/or at Geneva.Article (4)(c).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairshanded round the following redraft:-&quot;as regards the air existing provisionssuch as Article 35 would &quot;be maintained hut the table referred to in Article 40 would he replaced by the table now annexed.      Thus no signatoryshall possess aeroplanes exceeding three tonsunladen weight..     Figures for countries atpresent not entitled to possess military air-craft will be fixed by the Permanent disarmament commission if that body fails to produce asatisfactory scheme for the complete abolitionof military and naval aircraft as a result oftheir investigations under Article 35.BelgiumChinaCzechoslovakiaDenmarkEstoniaFinlandFranceGreeceItalyJapanLatviaLithuaniaNetherlandsTable    -   Aeroplanes.180 Norway 90120 Poland 240240 Portugal 6060 Eoumania 18060 Siam 9060 Spain 240600 Sweden 9090 Switzerland 90600 Turkey 120600 U.S.S.R. 60060 United Kingdom   60060 U.S.A. 600180 Yugoslavia 240A further allowance, to be decided on byagreement, would be made by the Permanent disarmament commission to such States as are responsible for colonial possessions for use therein.&quot;The Secretary of State for Air stated that thiswas acceptable to the Air Ministry and the Cabinetoffered no observations.
Article (7).It was pointed out that Article  (7) did not  quiteconform to the previous Cabinet decision on supervision and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertooknot at present to advance beyond that decision.(Cabinet 51 (33) Conclusion 2).Subject to the above remarks, the cabinet approved the Annex to C.P. 228 (33).
ABSENCE OP THE 3. The Prime Minister informed the CabinetSECRETARY of state FOR -FOREIGN    that notwithstanding the old rule to the contraryAFFAIRS..   .  . it had been considered, essential and right to allowForeign Office the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the ForeignArrangements.Office to proceed abroad on leave even though theSecretary of State was out of the country at Geneva.He had arranged that during the absence of theSecretary of State the Lord President of the council would be in charge of the Foreign Office.The Cabinet approved these arrangements.
4. The First Lord of the Admiralty made a verbal report to the Cabinet to the effect thatCommunist Agents known to the authorities had in their possession a pamphlet intended to be issued to theFleet containing a gross incitement to mutiny.The state of the law was such, however, that nothing could be done to stop the issue of the pamphlet.After the event those proved to have issued it couldbe punished but probably it would only be possibleto secure evidence against a distributor who would bea mere hireling.      The existing law did not make itan offence to prepare such a pamphlet or to hold it before publication.The Home Secretary informed the Cabinetthat this was a question of rather long standingwhich had been investigated and discussed with the law/ Officers during the last session.        Subject toone question which would have to be decided by theCabinet as to Whether the proposed powers should beavailable to the Civil Service or only to the forcesof the Crown, a memorandum v/as ready and a Bill hadbeen drafted.      He undertook to circulate a memorandumon the subject before the next meeting of the Cabinet.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That on the matter of any immediate action the First Lord should consult the legalauthorities within whose province thematter lay.(b) That on the broader question of the intro-duction of fresh legislation the HomeSecretary should circulate a memorandum for consideration at the next meeting.
NEXT MEETING 5.      The Cabinet confirmed, the previousOP THE CABINET.decision that the next meeting of the Cabinet shouldbe held on Wednesdays 18th October, 1933.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.,9th October, 1933.
