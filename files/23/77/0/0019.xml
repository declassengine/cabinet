JUDGES&apos; 1* Prime Minister consulted the Cabinet about-MLARIPS *a draft reply that had. been submitted to him Depart-(previous mentally to the following Question on the subject ofI Reference:Icabinet 64       Judges&apos;  Salaries :-1(33), Con-elusion 7.) &quot;Mr.Vyvyan Adams, - mo ask the PrimeMinister whether it is the intentionof His Majesty*s Government to intro-duce a declaratory Bill to confirm thet?ldk)\o. principle that, when the salaries ofthe judges were subjected to reductionsunder the Economy Act, 19 51, there wasno infringement of their judicialindependence;    and, if so, when such legislation is contemplated&quot;.After some discussion of the matter in the lightof recent statements in the House of Lords by theLord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for War,it was left to these two Ministers to draft a reply.At the end. of the Meeting the Lord chancellor and the Secretary of State for War accepted thesuggestion of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs that the reply should include the followingessential sentencer-&quot;The Government has under consideration whether such a declaratory Act isnecessary or desirable&quot;.this was approved by the Cabinet.
2. The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that his correspondence included a number of protestsagainst recent Government statements in both houses of Parliament on the possibility of an increase inBritish air armaments,   &quot;&quot;lie Society of Friends, inparticular, was passing resolutions on the subject.Although the question of Reduction and Limitationof Armaments was recognised to be at a critical stage,the Cabinet did not pursue the subject, since theywere informed that a Meeting, had been arranged ofthe Ministerial Committee on Disarmament for the same afternoon.
PERSIA. 5. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs warned the Cabinet that a rather difficult situation(previous reference:     had arisen with the Persian Government .   The Shah had cabinet 50(33), Con-     become incensed at some remarks published in the elusion 3.)&quot;Evening Standard&quot;, and his annoyance would be much-)c(33jJt     increased when he received a copy of a recent articlepublished by &quot;The mimes&quot;.    He understood that &quot;the times&quot; now intended to publish a second article,which would give them an opportunity for publishingin addition a leading article of a soothing character.The difficulty was that the Shah, who was subject toviolent excesses of passion at times, threatened tobreak off relations if some reparation to the affrontwas not offered.
R- COVENANTRr^HP LEAGUE, 0p NAT IONS .Illnly and tne/Covenant.(previous ousgpference:Cabinet 3pj, Con-elusion 5,)4. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to a communique&quot;&apos; issued in Rome after the meeting of the fascist Grand Council on the previous day, to theeffect that the Council had decided that the furtherstay of Italy in the League of Nations was conditional upon a radical reform of that organisation, to beeffected in the shortest possible space of time, andwhich must touch the League of Nations in its constitution, its working, and its objects ,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat he had done his best to induce the ItalianGovernment to restrain the Fascist Grand Council,though naturally it was a delicate matter.   ThePress message tended to show that the real issuenow was less Disarmament than the constitution ofthe League of Nations, which both Germany and italy were considering.
$OLIGY,A BudgetMurplus andpie Questionmf the Guts,lite.previousfReferenee cabinet 661(33), Oon-conclusion 5.)I       ^ ,5, The Prime Minister raised the question of aBudget Surplus and the question of Outs, etc.:Principles as to its Disposal;    of which he had given notice in his Note on Government Policyf CP,-231 (33)). He recalled that some members ofthe Cabinet had given pledges to the effect thatreductions in the cuts and in taxation would go handin hand:    that is to say, that any surplus balanceswould be divided, between the two.   He felt, therefore,that some discussion of the question was important.In the early part of the discussion suggestions were made to the effect that it was diffidmlt toconsider the question unless the Cabinet knew whether there was going to be a surplus, and,  if so, how much.    It was also- suggested that the relief oftaxation and the reduction of cuts were essentiallyinterchangeable.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked theCabinet to dismiss from their minds the question of whether there would be a surplus in the comingBudget, and, if so, of what amount, and to considerthe question in the abstract.   He had no doubt that every speech that Ministers had. delivered on thesubject would be closely scrutinised.   The real question was,  &quot;What are the public expecting?&quot;As a previous speaker had said, the position hadbeen fundamentally altered by the Naval events in1931.   ^he May Committee had not recommended a flat rate, or that the cuts should be associated withthe emergency then existing.    It was true, of course,that the financial emergency had necessitatedeconomies, but the recommendations were not emergencyrecommendations, nor were they the same for allpublic servants:    for example, the May Committee
had recommended a 20%, cut for teachers and the cabinet had reduced it to 15^, and the teachers had been so informed.    mhen, however, had come the Naval episodes,and the Government had felt  obliged to adopt a 10% flat rate cut as a general principle.    Out of this had comethe talk of equality of sacrifice, although in fact suchequality was difficult to achieve.   For example, a flat rate cut all round was not equality of sacrifice.   Never-theless, public opinion had come to consider it as such,and that the 10^ had been imposed to meet a sudden crisis,and that when that crisis ended the cut would be removed.On the whole, he thought public opinion was willing toleave it to theCovernment to decide when the crisis hadenried,    ^hat position would lead to the conclusion thatwhen the cuts were restored all must be treated alike andsirrmltaneously,    ^he amount of a surplus might render thatimpossible.    Some people were claiming a special position:e .g., teachers were claiming priority of restoration for themselves and were asserting to the London County council that a pledge had been given to them which was not beingfulfilled,^he President of the Board of Education said thatthese London teachers did not speak on behalf of the whole body, and were a special organisation.The Home Secretary said that the police claimedpriority over the teachers .&quot;Hie Chancellor of the Exchequer, continuing, saidthat in the House of Commons voices had been raised tosuggest that the poorest of the poor ought to have priority,namely, the unemployed.    In view of the state of publicopinion as set forth above, he felt that in principlehe could not do anything for Income Tax without doingalso something wrhich could be represented as equality oftreatment to those who had been cut:    but if, whenevera surplus was available, it was not sufficient to restore the whole of the lpJP and to put back 6d., he might haveto consider, since the 6d. could not be split, some special-6-
arrangement, though he would not express a definite vie- onthat,    -he question of the unemployed was not so simple as had been  suggested, as the situation had changed since the cutswere made.   At the time the cuts were approved they appliedboth to Unemployment Benefit and to Transitional Benefit,^e latter had now been replaced by the Assistance provisionsof the new Bill, which gave the same treatment to thoseformerly receiving transitional payments and those who,being ineligible for them, had formerly had to have recourse to the Public Assistance Committees.   mhe latter, however,had never been cut, because their relief had been based ontheir needs.    Now all those who received Unemployment Assist-ance were assessed on needs, and they could not thereforereceive a flat percentage increase in their allowances.He thought, however, that in practice any   increase in umemployment Benefit would very soon be followed by anincrease in the standard on which Unemployment assistance would be administered.    Referring to Unemployment Benefit,he recalled that the Statutory Committee could recommendalterations in benefits by varying the benefit rate, contri-butions,  etc., in certain conditions.   &quot;Iney could onlyrecommend an increase in benefits if there was a surplus inthe Fund and that surplus was likely to continue.    Supposingthe Bill had been passed and was in operation today, andthat the Committee tomorrow were to recommend an increase:that would in fact be traversing the principle, which publicopinion had established, of restoring all the cuts simulta-neously, if at all.    It was undesirable, therefore, thatthis should be done independently.    On the other hand, if and when a restoration of the other cuts might become possible, there was every likelihood of a surplus in theUnemployment Fund which would enable the Committee torecommend a restoration.   mhe figure of 2,500,000 unemployedhad been taken as the actuarial basis of the presentcalculations.    The nuroher of unemployed was considerably below that figure, and a surplus of  8,000,000 had already-7-
been produced, though this had been allocated.Nevertheless, that surplus might well increase,therefore,  in his view, it was essential that whenthe cuts were restored, the rate of benefit withinthe Unemployment Fund should, be increased at thesame time.The Chancellor of the exchequer then informed the Cabinet that when he took office he had made ithis definite aim,  in dealing with national finance,to build up the resources of the nation until theywere in an unassailable condition.   He had also wanted to demonstrate the strengthening of the national resources by progressive remissions in s tic cess iveBudgets.    So far he had been successful in carryingout that policy.    It had been almost an essential ofthat policy that his ^irst Budget should be anunpopular one.    wis second Budget had. been a little better, and he hoped that his third would be betterstill.    To complete the policy it was important toavoid an anti-climax in the case of his fourth Budgetby making all the concessions and. remissions in thethird Budget.The Prime Minister, after congratulating theChancellor of the Exchequer and remarking that his statement met with general assent, referred to theChancellor&apos;s request that the Cabinet should consider&quot;the question In the abstract, and pointed out that inhis Note he had used the word &quot;a Budget surplus&quot;, withthe same object ,The Minister of Labour did not agree that there could be no alteration in the standard of benefitunless at the same time the cuts were taken off.^he Unemployment Insurance Fund had now been placedon a purely insurance basis.       Insured persons
were therefore entitled to the benefit o^ any improvement in the Fund.    If a recommendation oamefrom the Statutory Committee in favour of increasedbenefits he thought it would be wrong for theGovernment to resist it on the ground that they couldnot at the same time remove the cuts.   He also pointed to one class which had never been cut at all,but who nevertheless, as recent Parliamentary Debatesshowed, ought to have some special consideration,namely, the children, for whom the 2/- was not sufficient,Some discussion took place at this point as toexemptions under the Means Test, which was stated tobe a matter of great political interest throughoutthe country.mhe Minister of Laboxir intimated that he proposedto continue and stand by the existing arrangements .He also informed the Cabinet that the savings underthe Means Test were half as much again as the estimatein 1931. Savings under the Correction of Anomalieshad also produced -g.4,000,000 per annum, as comparedwith an estimate of  3,000,000,The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs pointed out that remission of Income Tax would benefita large number of the artisan class, though it wouldnot directly benefit the unemployed.The President of the Board of Education warned the Cabinet that he would find it very difficult todefend any discrimination against teachers in anyremoval of cuts.    It might be possible to distinguish between the unemployed and other persons who had suffered cuts-, but there could be no discrimination between teachers and, for example, members of thepolice or the defence or civil services.    It was true, as had been mentioned, that when the cuts took-9-
place the teachers had been on the edge of a reductionanticipated from the proceedings of the burnham committee.    He himself had always felt that the right course was to put the teachers back into a goodbargaining position vis-a-vis the Local Authorities.The President of the Board of Trade pointed outthat most of the sections of the community that hadbeen mentioned had strong organisations to representthem.   This was not the case with the middle classes,on whom fell the burden of maintaining the trade and commerce of the country, who had no spokesman.   Whenthe time came he thought that some clear-cut method,such as relief of Income Tax, was a better subject for the application of a surplus than all kinds ofodds and ends,    Industry in this country was livingon a very small margin, and a slight additional burden would put much of it out of action.   Resourceshad been depleted by many causes, of which IncomeTax was not the least.   These millions could not betaken out of people&apos;s pockets without detriment.The Prime Minister said that the UnemploymentBill would not be passed without the Means Test being raised.   He felt that the Government were not entirelyblameless in the matter.   He was constantly receivinginformation from persons who made house-to-housevisits that the administration of the Means Testbore very hardly on the family.    He hoped that thismatter would not be overlooked.The Minister of Labour said that the LocalAuthorities, and not the central Government, were responsible for the administration.The Prime Minister said that so far as he was concerned he could not divest the Government of allresponsibility.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, referring tothe Minister of labour&apos;s remarks on the UnemploymentFund, admitted that the Fund had its own resources and that the surplus could be dealt with independ-ently.   There were, however, many forms in whichbenefit could be allotted, and it might be done without necessarily raising the question of cuts.
6.      The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of the Future of british commercial Air Transport:-A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Air (CP.-349 (33)) commenting ona Memorandum by the Board of imperial airways, Ltd. i CP.-110 (33)), whichhad been taken note of at the meeting referred to in the margin, and suggest-ing that the question should be remitted to a Cabinet Committee withsome such Terms of Reference as thefollowing:-&quot;To review the present positionof British commercial air trans-port in the light of the Memorandumrecently prepared, by the Board ofImperial Airways, with special reference to the further develop-ment of Imperial air routes:    andto make recommendations as to future policy, and in particularas to the relations between HisMajesty&apos;s Government and imperial airways&quot;:A Memorandum by the Postmaster-General(CP,-386 (33)), at the end of whichhe expressed, agreement with the abovesuggestion.After a short discussion it was pointedout that the differences between the Secretary ofState for Air and the Postmaster-General were considerable and involved large issues of policy.The Secretary of State for India agreed in the importance of the issues and was anxious that he should be put in a position before longto give India an idea of the part she was expectedto play in Imperial air communications.The President of the Board of Tradeinsisted on the interconnection between theSecretary of State for Air&apos;s proposals and theshipping industry and pressed that the termsof reference should be wide enough to enable
In order to avoid any undue limitationof the terms of reference, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs suggested the omission of the following words from the draft in Paragraph 7 of CP. 249 (33):-&quot;in the light of the Memorandum recentlyprepared by the Board of Imperial Airways.&quot;This was agreed to.The Cabinet agreed :-(a) That a Cabinet Committee as follows:-The President of the Board of Trade,(in the Chair)The Secretary of State for India,The Secretary of State for Dominion AffairsThe Secretary of State for the Colonies,The Secretary of State for Air,The Postmaster-General,The Financial Secretary to the Treasury,should consider the following terms ofreference:-&quot;To review the present position ofBritish commercial air transportwith special reference to the further development of Imperial air routes;and to make recommendations as to future policy, and,, in particular,as to the relations between HisMajesty&apos;s Government and imperial airways.&quot;and report to the Cabinet.(b) That the terms of reference quoted above should be interpreted to enable cognatequestions, including shipping services for example, to be considered.
