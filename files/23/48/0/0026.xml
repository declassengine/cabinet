Second,he desired to amalgamate the Ulster UnemploymentInsurance scheme with, the British scheme.&apos;-  At presentthe Ulster fund was separate, and, if it provedinsufficient, Ulster would either nave to rse!uce*-1-
benefits or increase taxation.    Third, he suggestedthat the cost of any migration which might result from the rectification of the boundary by the IrishBoundary Commission should be defrayed by the BritishGovernment.when ashed whether, supposing that these pointscould be conceded, Ulster would be prepared to acceptthe decision of the Boundary Commission, Sir james craig had not been willing to go further than to saythat he would accept the decision if it were not toofoolish.A final suggestion had reached the Prime minister from Sir James Craig that morning, through an inter-intermediary, to the effect that the British nominee onthe Irish Boundary Commission should be some person who had influence in, and was trusted by, Ulster,- aparticular name being mentioned.After hearing from the Chancellor of the Exchequerparticulars of the considerable sums already granted by the Treasury towards the cost of the Ulster special constabulary, as well as of the circumstances in which lord Colwyn1s Committee had been formed, and. after afull discussion of the political aspects of the situa-tion, the Cabinet agreed          v(a) That the policy of the Governmentshould be to proceed with thepassage of the Irish Free State. &apos;   .(Confirmation of Agreement) bill through Parliament without being drawn at this stage into any negotia-tions for a bargain with Ulster.   any subsequent developments, such as a challenge by Northern Ireland inthe Law Courts of the competence of the Irish Boundary Commission,should be dealt with as they arose:(b) The Parliamentary time-table at whiqhthe Government should aim, and whichthey were Informed Mr Baldwin was willing

The Prime Minister, as Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, -gave his colleagues a summary of thesituation in regard to Foreign Affairs in various partsof the world.,ARABIA. There was a report in the morning newspapersthat Mecca had been captured by the Wahabis.    There wasno official confirmation of this as yet,.but the newswas by no means improbable.    The British attitudebetween the contestants had been one of impartiality.Ibn Saud, the Chief of the Wahabis, had been warned that he must not Interfere with British subjects inMecca or elsewhere, and a ship had been sent to Jeddahwith a view to the withdrawal, in an emergency, ofBritish subjects, whether pilgrims or residents.PERSIA. Difficulties had arisen between the Sheikof Mohananerah, with whom the British Government had entered into certain agreements, and the CentralGovernment of Persia.    The Foreign Of lice was differ-entry advised by the Charge&apos; d&apos;Affaires at Teheranand the British Representative at Ahwaz.    The attitudeof the British Government was to secure peace.    Troops(not by the oil Interests, however)had been ashed/for the protection of the oilfields,but had been declined.IRAQ. Difficulties had arisen in Iraq owing to the ill-treatment by the Turks of certain Assyrians in thethe persia!situation.previous reference:Cabinet 59(20) , Con-elusion 4(a).)5aq,.;0SUL.previous-reference:cabinet 3824) , Con-conclusion 1. )neighbourhood of the boundary of Iraq, who had fled,of the territorywith the Turks in pursuit, across the boundary,now being delimited by the League of Nations.    Thepresence of the Turks across the frontier was calculated to cause great trouble in Iraq, and it had been neces-sary to bomb some Turkish forces.    The Prime Minister-o-
had seen the Turkish Minister and had told him thatwo could not allow Turkish troops to - enter territory under consideration by the League.    If, however, theTurks would withdraw their troops, we would agreenot to send our aeroplanes beyond a certain line, andwe would accept the decision of the League of&apos;Nations.The Turks had also been warned that we would not allow the situation to be rushed.    For the. moment thesituation appeared to be easier.EGYPT ANDTHE SUDAN.(previous reference:Cabinet 39(24), Con-elusion 1. )EGYPT AND THE SUDAN.  The Prime Minister gave afull summary of the present situation in regard to egypt and the Sudan.    He had sent a Memorandum tothe Committee of Imperial Defence (CI.D. Paper No.f^5)4-B) pointing out the inconsistency of the earlierreoommendations of the Committee with the grant of independence to Egypt which had been made by a previous government, and asking the Committee to re-examinethe problem of the security of the Canal in the lightof the present political considerations.    He had some reason to believe that Zaghlul Pasha might propose a status quo in the Sudan.    This, however, would not beiacceptable 1   it meant, that Great Britain was to remain responsible for the administration while Egypt was to pursue a policy of propaganda and uixilermining theBritish position with the Native troops, etc.
arbitration and LIMITA-TION of armaments.(previous reference:Cabinet 35(24), Con-conclusion 3(b).)3.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the First Lord of the Admiralty on the subjectof the Arbitration and Limitation of Armamentsdiscussions at the Assembly of the League of nations at Geneva (Paper CP.-456 (24)).The Cabinet felt some apprehension lest theBritish Government should be committed, or at leastthat its freedom might be prejudiced, through the signature of the&apos; Cabinet Ministers at Geneva toProtocols which t according to Press reports, arebeing drawn up, but which the. Cabinet and theGovernment Departments had had no opportunity toexamine.In this connection telegrams which had passed between the Prime Minister and Lord Parmooron the subject were read to the Cabinet, of whichthe following are extracts:-Bxtract^froiu Telegram from thePrime Eiiflster to Lord Parmoor,dat ed Septeiibe r &quot;SIT&quot;l&quot;924T&quot;!iI also hope, as it is a thing that the French will never under-1-stand, that you are emphasizingat every point that all proposals must^ he con side red by Governse nt sand&quot; accepted by Parliament;   andthat while making&apos;this reservation \we are just as sincere in our determination to come to an a cere e-ment as any of the countries whichare trying to rush us.&quot;Extract from Tele grata from LordParmoor to the Prime Minister,&quot;V,&apos;e are all of opinion&apos; that we are&apos;not coOiiitting E.H. G. to anythingoutside the limits of your speech....... We have emphasized at every point that all proposals must beconsidered by Govenmiarrbs&quot;l hdaccepted by&quot;Parliament.    There wasa prolonged discussion on this pointbetween British and French represent&apos;^atives on Sub-G oiaiii 11e e.    British
delegate refused entirely to placeGovernment under obligation untilnatter had been before it andproposal accepted by Parliament...... Yesterday:-   Long meeting-with British Dominions and fullexplain tion that there was nocommittal of Governments at thisstage of any hind.    dominions were in agreement , and I think there is now no real difference,between us.    You may rest assured that we shall not go outside theabove limitations.&quot;After some discussion, the Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State for Foreign.   - Affairs should send a telegram to LordPa mo or-, at Geneva, to the followingeffectCabinet has considered the Geneve,position in view of confusingreports in papers regarding signinga protocol which might commit theGovernment in -any way.    Cabinetwishes to make clear that in accord-ar.ee with agreement between Frenchand ourselves the findings of the commissions and the Assembly should come only as recommendations to theGovernments without committing themand you are urged to make clear thatany signature you ray give, ifsignatures are unavoidable, will carry no more meaning than thatyou are agreeing to make such ar e c Oiimendati on to-your Gov e mme nt.

The Seoretary of State for India handed round copies of telegraphic correspondence with theViceroy in continuation of Paper CP. -452 (24).lire Cabinet agreed  That the correspondence should bereferred to the Committee on Indian .Affairs.(U.

I^AKAGS OF^FORMATION.Previousleferenoe:cabinet 3324), Con-conclusion 2.;5.    The attention of the Cabinet was called toa serious leakage of information which had occurred in regard to the proceedings of their previous meeting on the subject of &quot;India:    The Situation in bengal&quot; , and which had been published in the LondonLetter of the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; in the following terms on the day following:-&quot;I understand that by far the greaterpart of the prolonged meeting was concerned with one grave matter the state of India.    Indeed, Iunderstand that the urgency of thisquestion was the real reason forsummoning the Cabinet.    It wasnecessary that the whole Govenmientshould be summoned, in view of theheavy responsibility&quot;.The Minutes of the Cabinet had not beencompleted until after this notice had been published.With the exception of the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; prac-tically the whole Press had been completely at faultas to what had been discussed at the Cabinet, all ofwhich pointed to an indiscretion by someone who hadknown what the Cabinet had discussed.The Secretary of State for India communicated atelegram from the Viceroy, dated September 29, to theeffect that this leakage had been reproduced with additional details in the Indian newspapers &quot;Englishman&quot;and &quot;Statesman&quot;, and was gravely embarrassing.    Therewas a dang;;!&apos; that the revolutionists would probablyabscond and go into hiding.    The leakage was the moreunfortunate in that special and elaborate care hadbeen taken to preserve       secrecy in India.The suggestion was made that the Secretary ofState for India might consider the -desirability ofGpirmunleating privately with the Editor of the&quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;..

The situation in regard to theSudan had been particularly difficult, but st030s had beentaken which had quietened downmatters for the present. . Ourposition in-regard to -the Sudanwas less strong than the PrimeMinister had been led to believe.In&apos; regard to the general questionof Egypt the Prime&quot; Minister wasto meet Zaghlul Pasha during thepresent week.   Our present diffl-cultles were due to the fact thatthe Government&apos;&apos;s predecessors had,instead of, negotiating the questionof independence in conjunctionwith questions affecting our.own security, had granted independence and reserved the four most difficultpoints, including the Sudan and theArmy of Occupation, for subsequentdiscussion.
Politically this was the most pressing question.    attention was called to Mr Asquith1s letter in &quot;The Times&quot; of even date onthe subject.The Prime Minister was not withouthope that Germany might be admitted to the League during the present session of the Assembly.The Prime Minister gave an outline of the negotiations and progressat Geneva on the above questions.The basis of the scheme was thatany nation which refused arbitration-\7rr\t T 1 r\     r\&apos;i 1+ 1 o inir    n 4- c* .a &apos;1 -P       o -i in    4* V*    4-If, by May 1, 1925, a majority of thePowers that were permanent members ofthe Council of the League, as well asten other States, had accepted the protocol, there would be a Conferenceon Limitation of Armaments beginning;on June 15th, which might be expectedto last for some months.
