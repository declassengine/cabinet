The Pr.i;;5 Minister pave his oollyagvJ.es an appreciation of - the present situation of the Inter-Allied Conference on Reparation.Tlie Inter-JAllied Coniferenee;$previous reference:Cabinet 43(24), Con-elusion 1. )Itori: officmference.goiaiatteetor Reads&quot; ofllelesations.sifel, Com-There had been three Meetings of the PlenaryConference.    The method of working the conference had been to appoint Committees to consider specific points referred to them.    There had been three Commit-tees on the ordinary work of the Conference, and, inaddition, two Committees of Jurists had been appointed.There had also been a daily meeting of the PrimeMinisters and Principal Delegates, in order to. surveythe situation from day to day from the point of viewof the Governments rather than that of the.Experts,and this meeting had served as a clearing-house for thediscussion of politica.1 questions.The First Committee had dealt with the questionof the guarantees required to enable a Loan to be raised as provide^., in the Dawes Report.    The controversy onthis Committee had centred round the powers of theReparation Commission,    The French regarded theReparation Commission as almost sacrosanct., whereas we regarded it in a different light.    The difficulty onthe First Committee, therefore, was to satisfy both theFrench point of view and that of possible subscribersto the Loan.The Second Committee dealt with the arrangementsfor the establishment of economic unity in Germany.The Prime Minister placed on record that the e.-:traordina;satisfactory Report which had been produced op this-7-
KteeJit &quot;OepiTfsTr ahcT&apos;omageot,citation?a-ISn.    -subject was due partly to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies, who had taken the Chair at the SecondCommittees but largely also to the admirable- work ofSir Warren Fisher, the Permanent Secretary to theTreasury, who had taken the Chair at the Sub-Committee.An outstanding point on the Second Committee wasin regard to the French and Belgian railwaymen whom theFrench and Del-dan Governments wished to retain   notin the Ruhr, as stated in the newspapers, but in the rhineland.    The Prime Minister intimated the possibilities-ity that if agreement were reached on other pointshe might be willing to make some concession on thispoint, provided that the railway experts naiiitainedthat &quot;it was not detrimental to the economic unity ofGermany, and subject to agreement by the Germans them-selves, whose opinion would be taken into consideration before any concession was made.The Third Committee was still at work on questionssome of which were comparatively easy and others trouble-some.The Prime Minister.then referred in complimentaryterms to the work of the Committee composed of Sir CecilHurst, of the Foreign Office, and M. Fromageot, of theFrench Foreign Office, which had prepared the way for an invitation to the Germans to come to London.    The PrimeMinister said that the Report indicated&quot; that an invitation to the Reparation Commission to come to London was alsoentailed.    In this connection he felt bound to mentionan unfortunate incident.    The British Representative onthe Reparation Commission, who happened to be in London,had instructed his representative by telephone to ooposea resolution that the Commission should come to London.
The Prime Minister had himself learned of this during a meeting of the Heads of Delegations, with whom hehad discussed the matter briefly, but without layingundue stress on it.   He was now informed that Sir john bradbury&apos;s action had upset the other members of theReparation Commission completely, and that no resolu-tion had been reached.   As a result, M. Harriot, theFrench President of the Council, had received a telegramasking that he (the Prime Minister) , as President ofthe London Conference, should send a telegram informing the President of the Reparation Commission that theConference had unanimously accepted the recommendationof the Jurists that the Reparation Commission shouldbe asked to come to London for consultation.. M* elemental, the French Minister of Finance, had brought him this message, and he had at once sent the telegram.   This might lead to a difficult situationin regard to the British Representative, but he feltthat it was necessary to face this.As regards the Germans, the Prime Minister saidthat he had aimed at concluding the present Conferencein time to hake a statement in Parliament on Monday,August ,4th, 1924, the tenth anniversary of August 4th,1914, when Sir Edward Grey (now Lord Grey) had made his speech at the outset of the War.   He had felt thata speeph announcing the conclusion of a definite peace on this anniversary would have an extraordinarypsychological effect, but he feared that this programme was now jimpracticable, owing to -the slow progress of the Committees.   With the consent of li* Harriot and -the other Heads of Delegations, however, he had asked the Gemi-an Ambassador to warn his Government that an
official invitation might be expected in the nearfuture, although a date could not yet be fixed,forthe reason he had given.venation The Prime Minister said that he had written a:th9-4itSr.letter to II. Harriot and H. Theunis rerilnding them thatthe French and Belgian Governments had entered the Ruhrsolely in order to secure economic results, and had intimated that;as the economic position was to be cleared up by the Dawes Report, it was illogioal forthem to maintain their troops there.    The French and&quot;Belgian Prime Ministers were now trying to bargain withhim on the subject, and had raised in this connection the question of Inter-Allied Debts.    He had refused tomix up these questions, and had pressed them to treat the question of the Ruhr in its historical aspects.This negotiation had been kept outside the Conferenceand he had made it perfectly clear that the&apos;BritishGovernment did not recognise the Ruhr occupation, andnever had recognised it.    He was hopeful of reaching agreement.    He understood that the German Governmentwere quite willing that the evacuation of the Ruhr       &apos; -should be by stages.    He himself, however, intended to insist that the stages must be marked not by somecomparatively vague expression such as a declaration bythe Reparation Commission that such-and-such a conditionhad been fulfilled, but either by a date or some eventwhich was equivalent to a date.    On this question he intended to take the advice of his legal advisers.The Prime Ministers would meet at 4 p.m. that afternoon.
2 94tS kiThe Prime Minister stated that the arrangementsfor the representation of the Dominions and for theBritish Empire Delegation were working admirably.   TheIrish Free State alone had stood out of the BritishEtapire Delegation, but had expressed a good will towardsits work and the work of the Conference.In reply to a question as to the evacuation ofCologne by the British forces, the Prixae Minister said he proposed to consult the Legal Advisers of the ForeigaOffice on the subject.   He had some reason to believethat the French were contemplating a proposal that ifthe British Government would extend their occupation ofCologne for twelve months they would withdraw from the ruhr ooinoiuenvly with the British evacuation.   he anticipated opposition from the Germans to the evacua-tion of Cologne by the British forces.
6. The Cabinet had before then the following documents:-A Note by the Parliamentary Under-Secret ary of State, Foreign Office,dated July 18th, 1924, in &quot;regard tothe Anglo-Soviet Conference, in whichhe urged that, in order to avoid an inevitable breakdown of the negotiations and the serious political consequencesinvolved therein, the Government shouldguarantee a Loan (say of  30,000,000)to Soviet Russia.A Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer, containing strong f inane is. 1reasons against any such guarantee(Paper 0. P. -415 (24)).&quot;-S^*A Memorandum covering the draft Anglo-Soviet treaty in connection with the draft Commercial Treaty,the attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the fact that under Article 2 the Russian Trade Mission would betreated as members of the Soviet Union Embassy in London,and as such would enjoy all the privileges and imtiunitiesappertaining thereto, including sxtra-tcrritoriality fortheir offices.    This was a new feature in diplomatic&apos;intercourse.In connection with the Political Treaty attention was drawn to the following points:-Articl /5^ one effect of jprieh would beto exclude British fishing vessels froirt^a^Vvliite Sea.Article 10, under the provisions of whichthe claims of both parties in regard to national Debts contracted between Aupust4, 1914, and February 1, 1924, are reservedfor discussion at a later date.article 22, which provides for the cessation of propaganda by the Soviet Union, includingthe restraint of ;        &quot;all persons and organisations under their direct or indirectcontrol&quot; , but does not state Whet her theThird international is regarded as under their &quot;direct or indirect control&quot;.The T^iS&amp;s&amp;b &quot;under-Sepretary of Statefor the*Foreign Office was particularlyashed to make clear, at&apos; the approprialemoment^that the British government&quot;&quot;regaTrdedthe Third International&quot; as uncTer the controlof tne soviet&apos; Union.&apos;    &apos; &quot;     &quot;---------
The discussion centred mainly., however, on those Articles which related to the claims of bond-holders and property owners, and on the proposal thatthe Government should guarantee a Loan.In the course of the discussion it was elicitedthat while most of the Articles of the draft commercial treaty had been discussed with the representativesof the Soviet Union, the actual text of the draft treaty before the Cabinet had not been communicatedto them.    It was also made clear that the guarantee ofthe ./Loan to the Soviet Union would not be granted     unless and until agreement had been reached in regard to thesettlement of claims and compensation as provided forin Articles 12 and IS of the draft Treaty.    If, forexample, agreement was not reached by: the Boards it was proposed to set up under the provisions of these. j.jt , &quot;by themArticles and separate reports were for^vardecb-, no Loanwould be contracted until agreement had been reached.The Cabinet agreed   Off&apos;(a) (By a najority) That the FoMMfanomfc UndSecretary of State for Foreign Affairsgamble andtide 1,4letionArticle 5,JJ Articlesto 25elusive.should have authority to send a telegram to Moscow, for the information of M.Rakovsky,the head of the Delegation of the soviet union, ooixainicating&apos;the text of theproposed Articles relating to the claims of property-owners&apos;4, together with an offer to the following effect:-11 Provided the Soviet Governmentagx-3e to the provisions regardingproperty claims, accept the Treatiesas drafted, and fulfil the obligationsimposed upon them by the Treaties,and provided the British Governmentreceive the approval of the dominions in accordance&quot; with our usual oblij^-tions, the Cabinet is prepared to &quot;recoimiend Parliament to guaranteea Loan&quot;.0The Precise wording of the telegram to ifC^ii^ymMg^&quot;Ithe Soviet Union was left to the Benaarusnt. ^&apos;%Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, iin consultation with his legal and politicaljf advisers.(The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,nwho was one ofthe dissentients&quot;asked that his, dissent&apos; gqghi ,be&quot;^recor:Ied
(b) That no Treaty should be ratifieduntil the Dominions had been eon-suited on the subject.
7.   In view of the possibility of legislationbeing required in certain contingencies, and in viewmore particularly of the shortness of the time avail-able before the adjournment of Parliament, the cabinet discussed as a matter of urgency the course to beadopted in the event of a Report by the JudicialCommittee of the Privy Council to the effect that theIrish Boundary Commission could not be set up withoutfurther legislation.After considerable discussion, the cabinet agreed -That in the event of such a Report bythe Judicial Committee of the privy council, the Secretary of State forthe Colonies should have authorityto invite the Leaders of the Opposi-tion Parties in Parliament to meet him, to explain the situation to them,and to state that in the view of theGovernment the only course which couldavert serious trouble in the Irish FreeState would be as follows.     inasmuch as the legislation neoessary to enablethe Commission to be established wouldbe in effect an amendment of the Treat:/,it would be necessary that a SupplementalAgreement should be cade between the twoGovernments, and that that agreement should be ratified by both Parliamentsby scheduling it to a one-Clause Billon the lines of the Irish Free StateAgreement Act, 1982.   Unless the Leadersof the Opposition Parties had some bettersuggestion to make, he should invite their co-operation in passing the proposed bill through Parliament as rapidly as possible,although he should warn them that it might involve postponing the Adjournment forseveral days.   Should the Leaders of theOpposition Parties aoquiesoe In the policy proposed, the Secretary of State shouldtake immediate steps to conclude theAgreement with the Government of theIrish Free State, and to prepare thenecessary legislation.

SECRET.circulated to the Cabinet.The Prime Minister.The ChanceXLpr ,of the.Exchequer.ANgLO-SOVTET COQBREMTg.I have now reached a stage in the negotiationswhen except for drafting amendments and one or twoclauses of the treaty, I am able to report that substantial agreement iss in sight.Mr. RakovskiTs acceptance of the treaty as itwill eventually emerge has been throughout dependenton the raising of a loan.    But before I can get his consent to the one or two outstanding points ofimportance some assurance with regard to the loan isnecessary.     Up till now I have only declared that incertain contingencies I would take it upon myselfto approach the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of theExchequer, and through them the Cabinet, with regardtc the Government guarantee of a loan.    The time hasnow come for me to do this.    Only a few weeks of theParliamentary session remain, and the matter ispressinge    I therefore venture to submit the following considerations with regard to a Government guarantee:-d) ....
fl) There is no question whatever that a loan withouta Government guarantee will not he forthcoming from theCity.(2) There is equally no doubt that without a loan theSoviet delegation will not conclude any agreement.(3).A postponement sine die would amount to a breakdown of the negotiations.(4) A breakdown of the negotiations would have serious political consequences,(a) negatively.   A great chance of conciliationtending towards general recovery In europe would have been lost,fb) positively.     Soviet Russia failing with us would have no chance of coming to an agree-ment with i^rance and, cut off from western europe, might become the focus of dangerousactivities in Eastern Europe,fc) The failure would be resented very bitterlyby the Party, not only in the House ofCommons but in the country.   A chance of getting work for the unemployed would againhave been missed.(5) I therefore think the Government would be justifiedin guaranteeing a loan (say, of 30 millions), and coixlddefend their position both in Parliament and thecountry.     The Soviet delegation is; prepared to commititself to spending in Great Britain not less than two-thirds ...
AGREEMEM*S ...two-thirds of the money raised.(6) I ao not think there would! be official oppositioneither from the Tories or the Liberals, and, as the debate showed the other day, the back bench criticismis negligible.     Home has intimated that theTory front bench would not be likely to oppose aguarantee; there has been an article in &quot;The Spectator&quot;in favour of it.   Several Liberals have asserted thatthe liberal party would support it.(7) The agreement when completed can, I consider, be satisfactorily defended in Parliament,    The Sovietdelegates mve yielded on many points with the pro-spect of a loan in view.   I think I can get theremaining   points, with a Government guarantee assured.The procedure I would suggest would be asfollovi?s:-^BUBEAL TREATY comprising clauses acSmittlng liabilitywith regard to debts and claims;   a Commercial Treaty,Arbitration Treaty and Territorial Waters agreement and a loan clause:to be signed,to be printed as a White Paper,to be explained to Parliament on the Appro-priation Bill before the House rises.Exchange of Uotes arranging for appointment.of expertsunder the above to set to work on property claims and miscellaneous claims.to be ratified after 21 Parliamentary days,i.e. October-Hovember.
AGHKSMMlgSi.   with bondholders;ii.    on property aiaims;III. on lump sum for miscellaneous claims,to he reached.Then further TREATY (or Protocol to above Treaty)embodying figures and methods of payment - to be laid.BILL With financial resolution determining amount ofloan to be passed through, all stages and treaty to berat ified.The rough draft of the Treaty will be ready nestweek, but the Soviet delegates have still to go throughit.I would like a meeting between the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and Mr. Hakovsky to be arranged as soonas possible.(Signed) Arthur POJISOHBY.18th July, 1924.FOSBIGB OFFICE,21st July, 1924.
&apos; 16 335SECRET. Be Do24.ANGLO-SOVIET CONFERENCEtgrijbothe Cabinet.---------------MEMORAKTDtTM ON THE ANGLO-SOVIETDRAFT TREATY.This draft is a reversion in substance to theoriginal drafts proposed by us at Genoa, The Hagueand in the early stages of the present negotiations,and represents a further (and probably final)endeavour to obtain from the Russians an admission ofprinciple in respect of- the two vital questions i.e.pre-war debts and properties;   it is an abandonment of the alternative method which we have tried in vainof reaching a concrete financial settlement independent of.principle *After an early  allure to extract anything inthe nature of admission of liability from the Russians,it was decided to bring them into direct contact withthe bondholders on the one hand and into indirect con-tact with the property owners on the other in the hopeof their being able to come to terms on a purelybusiness basis and so exonerate us from the apparentlyimpossible task of inducing the Russians to admit theirliabilities.    Meanwhile, the Russians (who have per-sistently proclaimed that their present financial andeconomic conditions prevent them from paying a cent to anyone), have been scouring the City for a loan.   after several weeks of conversations it became manifest (as indeed it was bound to do) that neither the City northe bondholders, nor the property-owners could come toany arrangement with them.     But all three elements .expressed themselves anxious that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment
Government should, nevertheless continue the negotiations on traditional lines (or any other that might be possible).Accordingly the whole procedure was reversed;hut this time on the definite understanding, whichit is very difficult to controvert, that the russians are unable to meet their financial liabilities inany direction unless the Russian machine can he setgoing again by financial assistance from outside, andthat assistance can only he given by government inter-vent ion.    Hence the emergence of the proposition thatthe only way out is to guarantee the Soviet   Union a loan, the proceeds of which would he devoted (a) to meeting the first instalments of numerous liabilitiesto us, (h) financing orders for machinery, shipping,etc to he placed in this country a     The allocation ofthe proceeds of the loan is not specifically statedin the present draft treaty3 hut it is understood thatthis will he one of the terms of the loan when it comes to he definitely negotiated0     In return forthis   concession by His Majesty5 s Government it isobvious that the Russians must abandon their non-possumus attitude in the matter of the admission ofprinciple, while leaving the actual determination of the amount of compensation, which they will haveto pay as a condition of definite settlement, to a subsequent agreement.     The loan will necessarilyonly he forthcoming when both acts have beenaccomplished by the Russians to our satisfaction.During the course of the negotiations, there hasbeen
o o 7been considerable discussion with both the financial interests involved and representatives of the City ingeneral as to the relative expediency of the twoforms of settlement,   and it has been evident that the admission of liability without immediate full dis-charge is regarded as being more calculated to restoreRussian credit than Immediate partial payments-,however advantageous to the claimants, on a writings-down basis without any indication   that liability is-admitted.     But whether or not this is so, it is now clear that the method which we have adopted repre-sents the only possible means of arriving at asolution.The present draft provides merely for a firstagreement, under which the Russians admit theirliabilities and His Majesty5s Government admit theprinciple of a guaranteed loanB     The next stage is a determination, considered acceptable by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, of the amounts which the U.S.S.R. willactually pay, and the fixing of &quot;the amount and terms,of the loan which His Majesty&apos;s Government will beprepared to guarantee in the light of the RussianpaymentSo     This will take the form of a second agree-ment.     If the Russians decline to accept figures whichwe- consider reasonable, there v/ill of course be noloan, and so the whole thing falls to the ground,,   Weare therefore in no way committed,- unless we getcomplete satisfaction on every one of the vitalquestions,,The important articles of the draft in this re-spect are 7, 8, and 9, (pre-war debts) and 13 (proper-ties),   very little exception can be taken to the debtsarticlest
articles, unless it be objected that the U.S.S.R.admits Its liabilities to British holders of bondsonly, and that the admission of liability is renderedworthless by any limitation.   But this is a negotiation between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the U.S.S.R. alone,and in practice the admission, far from prejudicing the rights of bondholders of other nations constitutesan advantageous precedent to which they can appeal.Article 9 may be criticised On the ground that asettlement acceptable to one half of the bondholdersalone is unfair, but the answer is that there is nobody properly representative of the bondholders andv/e are consequently obliged to take a somewhatarbitrary figure unless there is to be permanentobstruction.    Article 8 merely states a fact:   what-ever may be the cause of thesituation is irrelevantto this particular transaction0Article 13 (properties) is more open to criticism,and represents less than we have hitherto demanded,i.e. the principle of arbitration has been dropped.   Inpractice, however, the lever of the loan is likely tobe considerably more effective and this is providedfor in Article 14.     The question   is in any case corn-plicated.   The Russians are anxious themselves to get back five or six of the greater owners, such asUrquhart, and are not only ready to restore theirproperties on a concessionary basis, but are willingto grant them a cash compensation as well for thepurpose of providing fresh capital to re-start the enterprises.     This course is objectionable in theextreme in that it would not only leave the remainder(roughly 145) of the expropriated owners where theywere,
were, but would use up the bulk of such funds as might be1 available for cash compensation.     Thesmaller owners, who have been ruined and whom it isclearly our duty to protect in the first instance,would be completely extinguished.     On the other hand,it is certain that the figures of the various claims -(the aggregate is  180,000,000) are great inflated.The difficulty of ultimate assessment certainly re-mains theoretically unsolved under the provisions ofthe article, but it should net be impossible on thereceipt of the experts&apos; reports for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, to determine what is reasonable compensa-tion to demand as a condition of the loan.   MoRakovskihas been trying very hard during the last week towhittle down our article and has been urging that theloan should be conditional on &quot;substantial progress&apos;1being made in the investigating by the experts.   But,if this is done, we have no sort of security that theproperty owners will get any justice, and, as it is our first business to protect this class of claimant,any demand for further conegssion should be resistedat all costs0Article 11 deals with all the miscellaneous claimsincluding those for personal injury and imprisonment,which can-.only be settled by payment of a lump sum,.The loan is equally contingent on proper satisfactionbeing given us in this respect - vide Article 14.Article 10 constitutes an important concession onthe part of the Russians,     It places their portentouscounter-claim in respect of intervention in cold storage, as it does of course equally their war debtsto
to us.    But this has always: teen since Genoa our proposal for dealing with these and similar classesof claims.Article 16 enables us to prevent the Russiansfrom walking off with such sums to which they lay &quot;. claim, as, for instance, the  4, 500,000 hon byBarings, before they have satisfied our main demands.This particular sum represents the balance of the1 warloan made to the Russian Imperial Government andnever paid over.    It is doubtful, to say the least;whether, this money is rightfully theirs so long as theyrepudiate their war debt.      But this does not preventthan from claiming it.    Our contention is that itshould ultimately be used to liquidate, or help inthe liquidation of, some of our claims.Article 6 provides for the acceptance by theU.S.S.R. of our draft arbitration treaty.     So far the Russians have declined it on the ground that,having regard to their attitude towards the league ofNations, they cannot agree to a reference, howeverprovisional, to the Permanent Gourt of InternationalJustice.    It is not a point of substance, but weshould hold them to it and not accept an antiouatedform of arbitration treaty which we abandoned yearsago before the Hague Courts came into existence.Article 5 provides for an agreement in respectof fishing which is satisfactory to our experts.There remains the commercial treaty provided forin Article 1.     The draft of this treaty (annexed)contains ...
contains the controversial clause 2 allowing the U.S.S.H.to claim limited diplomatic immunities of a personalnature for certain trade agents.     Shis is, of course, a concession to the Kussians, and It is unnecessary hereto argue its merits or demerits Which have already beendiscussed at length.     In any ease, however, the con-cession would no doubt be considered totally inadmissibleif the commercial treaty were to be concluded independentlyand not as part of a general settlement,   Whether in thelatter contingency it should be made appears to bea question of political expediency.     It has been madeby both the Italians and Germans, and so we are not-setting a precedent.   &quot;The formula as finally drafted by us and   accepted by the Russians reduces to aminimum the effects of our concession.   But theprinciple of course remains.   Apart from the loan and(to a lesser extent) the abandonment of arbitration inthe matter of the properties, it is virtually the onlyconcession of substance we propose to make to theRussians.-   fox- the rest, if they want the loan, theyhave got to swallow moat of the statements they havemade during-the last lev; years and repudiate   theirrepudiation.   Their admission (already agreed to) thatold treaties remain in force or else have to be formallyput out of force is already an act of importance intheir recognition of continuing liabilities.   Thefurther step of acknowledging their financialindebtedness .....
indebtedness completes their surrender.Consequently, if they give way to this extent, weshall have gained very nearly all we have asked forsince we first came into conflict with them.   The charge that we have bought the surrender can, of course, be easily made and will be.   But, unless the U.S.S.R.gets money in some form or another - and it will certainly not get it until experience has restoredconfidence except as part of an agreement between thetwo governments - we must be content to give up allidea of resuming normal relations, worse than that, itmay probably he taken for granted that, should thepresent negotiations break down, relations will be even less satisfactory than if they had never been started.Whether this is a matter of vital importance tothe future international situation is arguable.    Itmay easily be contended that the Russians willprobably not observe the provisions of an agreement,even if we arrive at onG-      In that case we should never have started negotiations.    It is also heldstrongly in certain quarters that if the negotiationsbreak &amp;ovn now on a refusal by us to make anyfurther concessions, the Russians - compelled by the bad harvest that is imminent - will return hat in handwithin six months.     That is also problematical.IShat is certain is that an agreement based on further concessions will fail to achieve what is the immediateobject o..
object of renewed contact with the U.S.S.R., viz. therestoration of its credit and through that the properresumption of trade between the two oountries.Politically the Russians will doubtless be guided bytheir own interests in the future, like everyone else,agreement or no agreement.    But it woulfi be all thesame Imprudent to abandon lightly the possibility of acertain restraining influence on aggression as a resultof an agreement.   Such an Influence, however, willequally not be acquired by any further weakening byus, and, if the Russians rejoct what is now offeredthem, there is no further move possible from our side and events must take their course.   Certainly the blame  for a breakdown could not rest on His Majesty&apos;sGovernment as during the last four months every con-eeivable method of approach has been tried and theloan proposition is an unparalleled concession in theinterests of a peaceful settlement.FOREIGN OFFICE,S.W..828th July, 1924.
