(This Document is, the Property of His Britannic&apos;&apos;Bajesttyrsi Government.&apos;!-SECRET-CABINST 50 (24)CONCLUSIONS of a Meeting of the Cabinet, heldat 10, Downing Street, S.W.1, on MONDAY,SEPTEMBER 22, 1924, at 11-30 a.n.INDIA.ie situation it Bengal.hRvious; Iference:cabinet 4714) , Con-Insion 16.)The Cabinet had before them the following documents in regard to the situation in Bengal:-Copies of telegrams, despatchesj etc. ,which have passed between- the IndiaOffice and the Viceroy from the 31stJuly to the 11th September inclusive,circulated by the Secretary of Statefor India (Paper CP.-446 (24)):Telegrams supplementary to the above,received up to the 21st September, 1924(Papers CP.&quot;-451 (24) and CP.-452 (24)):A telegram from the Viceroy (mtSSP)dated 21st September. 1924, circulatedat the Meeting:The Draft Conclusions of a Meeting ofthe Indian Affairs Committee (I.A.(24)loth Conclusions)  (Paper GRP. -447 (24));A Memorandum by thesecretary or Statefor India (Paper CP.-448 (24-))The Cabinet took note that the latter document(Paper CP.-448 (24)) contains, as Appendix 3, atelegram dated &apos; 17th September,. 1924, sent by theSecretary of State to the Viceroy, with the approvalof the Prime Minister, authorising the Government ofIndia to acquire certain powers for dealing with thesituation in Bengal, subject to the exclusion from
the scope of the legislation mere sedition or provokingof class enmity or other offences consistent withexclusively political action.The general view of the Cabinet was that, ifthe Government of India considered it essential toreceive special powers for dealing with the assassina-tion and physical revolutionary movement, they ought toreceive such powers, but that it should be made quite clear that the exceptional powers were not asked for or used for dealing with political movements, howevertroublesome; that the Government of India should alsobe urged to devise without delay&apos; some political policywhich would save India from the political movementdrifting into the revolutionary movement;   also thatrepression should be preceded or accompanied by cleardeclarations and acts, such as approaches to Indianscommanding the support of a majority in the Councils,. to co-operate in the Central Provinces and Bengal informing Governments.In order to acquaint themselves with the precisenature of tho powers desired by the Government of India,the Cabinet invited the attendance of Sir Edward Chamler,Legal Adviser to the India Office, who was accompaniedCSSby Mr Hose., fefesS. , and who explained to the Cabinetthe significance of the Sections of the Indian PenalCode; the Indian Explosive Substances Act, 1908;    Section20 of the Indian - Arms. Act, 1878, referred to in theSchedule to the enclosure to thodespatch from the Government of India, No. 152, dated28th August, 1924 (Paper CP.-446 -(24), page 29).
It was pointed out that under the proposals contained in the telegram J^UWi^MMgi, dated 21stSeptember, 1924, the local Governments would receivespecial powers not only to try before a specialtribunal persons accused of the offences set forth in the above-mentioned schedule, but also to arrestwithout warrant arid to intern without trial personssuspected of the intention to commit those offences ,which include such political offences as sedition,rioting, provoking enmity between classes, in additionto more serious crimes.There was general agreement that a singleschedule was not applicable to the two classes ofpowers which the Government of India desired to obtain.Clause (l) of the schedule was considered superfluous,since it related to offences which were either coveredby the Indian &quot;Arms Act or were not specially germaneto the present inquiry.    No objection was taken to theapplication of Clause (2) of the schedule to theprovisions contained in Sections 1 to il of the draftOrdinance relating to the proposed setting up of specialtribunals.    It was felt, however, that the applicationof the powers contemplated under Section 12 of thedraft Ordinance, re 1?.ting to the power of the localGovernment to deal with suspects, should be limited as contemplated in the Seoretary of State&apos;s telegram ofthe 17th September(Paper CP.-448 (24)&apos; Appendix 3):that is to say, mere&apos;s edition or provoking class enmity,or other offences consistent with exclusively politicalaction, must be excluded from the scope of the loglsla-tion under tnis head.
After a careful examination of tlie scheduleCP.-446 (24) s page 33) and its applicabilitytwo classes of powers, the Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State for india should prepare a telegram embodying the views of the Cabinet, and, subjectto the approval of the Prime Minister,should send it at once,to the Viceroy.The text of the telegram, as approvedby the Prime Minister, is as follows:-&quot;Cabinet this, morning consideredBenpal correspondence ending with your private and personal telegramof 21st September!   We noted point to which you call attention as to-enlargement of scope of specialstatute if phraseology.you pro-poseis adopted, but it appears to us that this enlargement is aggravated by adoption of form you propose,that is to say, making provisionsof Clause 12 applicable to alloffences in the Schedule.We consider that the Schedule shouldbe amended by omitting the whole of clause 1 which relates to offenceswhich are either covered by IndianArms Act or are not specially germaneto present emergency. &apos; We do not object to provisions of first partof Ordinance, Sections 1 to 11,being made applicable to Scheduleas so amended, but we consider thatapplication of powers contemplate under Clause 12 should-be limitedas suggested in my telegram of 17thSeptember.    We therefore do not objectto&quot; sub-clause (b) of Clause 2 ofSohedu le in this conne ction, but,assuming that legislation by-refer-ence to&quot;Penal Code is deemed by younecessary, we do object to inclusion in sub-Clause (a) of.Sections 124(a),153(a) , 335, 386, 387, 392, 394,454, 455, 458, 459, 460, and it appears,to us necessary -that care should betaken that the application of thespecial powers under Section 12 shouldbe strictly limited to offences ofthe character described in my telegramof the 17th September.We are ready to give/ powers to enableyou to meet the situation created bythe assassination   and physicalrevolutionary movement, but we musturge upon you the necessity of making
it quite clear that you are not asking for and are not using exceptional powersto deal with political movements&apos;, howevertroublesome.    We must also , urge upon you the further necessity of devising Withoutdelay some political policy which willsave India from the political movementdrifting into the revolutionary movement.We press this upon the Indian government as being as urgent in its own way asrepressive measures against crime, andwish to have advice on this matter.The Cabinet feel very keenly thatrepression should be preceded or accom-panled by clear declarations and actssuch as approaches to Indians commandingsupport of majority in Councils to co-operate in Central Provinces and Ben,salin forming Governments. &quot;Whitehall Gardens, 8.W. 1,September 22, 1924.-        - -.&quot;     v    - Sill ill Pi
