The Cabinet were informed that a telegram,dated August 5, 1924, had been received by theSecretary of State for the Colonies from the PrimeMinister of Canada, congratulating the British PrimeMinister-and the other members of the Conference 11 onthe good will and skill displayed in bringing theirmomentous task to the successful issue which now seemsassured&quot;.
2. The Secretary- of State for the Colonies gave the Cabinet an account of the Conference in Dublin .with President Cos grave and three other xaeiribers ofthe Irish Executive, which had been attended by theHo me Secretary and himself on the previous day.    Theresults of the Conference had been embodied in astatement made that afternoon in Parliament(Appendix I)The negotiations had been protracted and difficult.Ultimately the British representatives offered tointroduce the /mending Bill before the Adjournment andto summon Parliament for September 30th for the purposeof passing It into law.    This date, in the opinion ofthe Irish Ministers, would mate rial ly help them ascompared with October 14th.    While unwilling to recedefrom their view that the Bill ought to be put throughbefore Parliament rose, they agreed in writing to resist attacks in the Dail based on the&apos; view that thefailure to put the Bill through now was a breach ofthe Treaty.    The Bill had accordingly been introducedthat afternoon,The Secretary of State for the Colonies, contin-uing, stated that he had seen Mr Stanley Baldwin andLord Londonderry, and ted shown to them in advance the statement he proposed to make in the House.    Theyhad expressed great satisfaction with it.    He gathered that the course which would be followed by the NorthernParliament would largely depend on the health of sir james Craig.    If they appointed a Commissioner between&apos;now and September 30th it would not be neoessa,ry to summon Parliament on that date.    But if that were not done there was some ground for hoping that resistance&apos;  - -2-   &apos;
to the Amending riill would not be carried to extremelengths.The Cabinet expressed their appreciation ofthe services of the British representatives at the dublin Conference, and,  generally,  of the way in whichthe negotiations had been conducted, and agreed  (a) To approve the arrangements which hadbeen concluded in Dublin:Cb) To approve the proposal of the LordChancellor to read in the House ofLords a Statement identical with thatread by the Secretary of State forthe Colonies in the House of Commons:(c) To reject all attempts, at being drawn into explanations of the Clause deal-in g with the Boundary which would havethe effect of defining or limiting its scope: -      . .(a) To take note that the Secretary ofState for the Colonies was preparing a &quot;Brief&quot; on the Boundary question for the use of Ministers.
h P11tf. o i)IR3LAND.Disturbanceson the border.3* The Cabinet wsts informed by the Home secretary and the Secretary of State for War that information had been received from the Imperial Secretary?Northern Ireland, and from the General OfficerCommanding, Northern Ireland, to the effect that sevenrifle shots had been fired from the Free State side ofthe Border at Special Constabulary on duty at Ballaga.at 10-45 p.m. on the night of August 4th.    There hadbeen no casualties to the Crown Forces.The Home Secretary read to the Cabinet a HomeOffice Note recording a visit to the Home Office by colonel Spender, Secretary to the Cabinet of NorthernIreland, on Tuesday, August 6th.   Colonel Spenderstated that he and Lord Londonderry had seen Lord Cavanand had gathe red that Lord Cavan had no instructionsto take action for the protection of Northern ireland in the event of a &quot;break&quot; occurring immediately.(The Note is set out in full in Appendix II.)The Secretary of State for the Colonies saidthat there was a very active and doliberate attemptbeing made In certain Unionist newspapers to fomenttrouble, and he had this in mind in the closing para-graph of his Statement to the House that afternoon.On hearing of Colonel Spender !s visit to the HomeOffice he had asked Lord Londonderry the meaning ofthe interview which he and Colonel Spender had with lord Cavan, and had been assured that it was casualand unofficial, and that he would apologise for anymisunderstanding which it might have caused.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that colonel Spender had seen his Private Secretary and had
spoken of the great amount of unemployment in belfast and the probability that there would be a rising ofthe Protestant workmen with the object of eviotingRoman Catholics.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To request the Home Secretary to seeLord Londonderry that evening and toexpress to. him the objections of theCabinet to the procedure followed by colonel Spender during the absence ofthe Home Secretary in Ireland:(b) To ask Ministers to keep the Secretaryof the Cabinet informed, of their addressesduring the Recess in the event of it being necessary to summon Ministers at short notice for consultation in any emergency which might arise in connec-tion with Ireland,&quot;or other matters of grave importance.
G0VEPJM3MTBUSINESS IN5HS HOUSEOP COMMONS.4. The Lord Privy Seal raised the question of whether, on re-assembling, he should put down a motion to take the whole time of the Rouse forGovernment business.    The present Standing orders had been framed when there was no Autumn Session, andthis particular Motion had beer, nnt ^m hy suooesslve1 On the previous evening, for example       A Q%&quot;over 60 of their supporters had voted     4&quot;against the Government on the plea that&quot;tho Motion for the adjournment, moved Try&quot;the Whips at the conclusion of Government&quot;Orders after 10 o!clock, constituted-an&quot;attempt to take away Private Members&apos;&quot;rights to Parliamentary time, as their&quot;measures could have been considered up&quot;till 11 o1clock.&quot;The view was expressed that with more and earlier explanation of the Government1s intentions and with better &quot;Whipping&quot;, the opposition within theParty could be greatly reduced.The Cabinet a,greed  That the usual Motion to take thewhole time of the House for Govern-ment business should be moved inthe customary form.
government business INTHE HOUSEOF COMMONS.4.  The Lord Privy Seal raised the question of whether, on re-assembling, he should put down a motion to take the whole time of the House forGovernment business.    The present Standing orders had been framed when there was no Autumn Session, andthis particular Motion had been put down, fay successive governments since 1911.The view was expressed that with more and earlier explanation of the Government1 s intentions and with better &quot;Whipping&quot; , the opposition within theParty could be greatly reduced.The Cabinet agreed  That the usual Motion to take thewhole time of the House for Govsrn-ment business should be moved inthe customary form.
&quot;THE WORKERS&apos; 5. The attention of the Cabinet was called to a weekly&quot;/  prosecution which had been instituted against Johnprosecutionof Editor.

The Cabinet had before, then Memoranda by theHome Secretary and the Secretary of State for theous Colonies in regard to Opium Policy (Papers CP.-414 (24)ence: ;t 47 and CP.-425 (24)), and agreed, with the assent of1 on-&apos;n 7*)        the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for theColonies  To postpone their considerationof the subject until after themeeting of the international conference which is to be heldat Geneva in September next.

L. P P B N D I X___I -IRISH. BOUNDARY ^OQMICTSS-IOM.the SoioniQS in the &quot;House of Commons on Wednesday. Augast 6th., ,      - - 1924.As the House is aware, in view of the report of theJudicial Committee of the Privy Council on the questions sub-mitted te thorn, His Majesty&apos;s Government felt it necessary toconfer with representatives of the Government of the Irish PreeState   acid of the Government of Northern Ireland, and a jointmeeting was held in London on the 2nd instant, after which therepresentatives of both Irish Governments returned in order to consult with their colleagues.    I had already on the previous day informed the House that His Majesty&apos;s Government felt thatit was an honourable obligation, binding upon the british people,  to secure that the undoubted intention of the Treaty wascarried into effect;  and in order that that &quot;obligation might b\efully discharged, His Ma j e styles Government entered into anAgreement with the Government of the Irish Pree State,  dulysigned on both sides, but subject to confirmation by the res-pective Parliaments,  to remedy the defect in the Treaty dis-closed by the   report of the Judicial Committee; and the purposecf the Bill, of which I have given notice today is to ratifyand give the force of law,  so far as this country is concerned,.to that Agreement.On the 4th instant my Rt.Hon.Friend    the Prime Ministerfreceived a letter from the President of the Executive Councilof the Irish Pree State in which Mr.Cosgrave stated that,after tho fullest consultation with his colleagues,, he felt itnecessary to urge upon the British Government the necessity cfpassing tho Bill into law before the adjournment of Parliament,in arder to remove finally fr^m the minds of the Irish people
the grave doubts end susoicions which the&apos; long delay in the sottingup of the Commission he.d erected.      My   Rt.hon . Friend the PrimeMinister felt that he could not cell upon Per lie merit to considerlegislation which wes certain to meet with serious opoosition notonly in this House but in another place at the very end of the session, end without ellowing at least some period of time forreflection both here and elsewhere as to the grave issues involved.At his request therefore my Rt.Eon. Friend the Home Secretary and Icrossed to Dublin that night.      We had the fullest and frankestdiscussion yesterday with.Mr. Ccsgrave and his colleagues.     Theyexplained to us the very serious difficulties with which they were faced; and we explained to them the difficulties confronting HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the British Parliament.      I hope and believethat this mutual exchange of views was of value to both sides.   Asa result of that discussion His Ma.iesty&apos;s Government feeling thatthey ought not to leave any room for doubt in the minds of the irish people or of the world of their determination to carry the Treatyinto effect have decided to ask Parliament to meet again on the 30thof next month instead of on the 28th of October as had been originally intended.      On- that date, unless in the meantime the Government ofNorthern Ireland has nominated a member of the Commission, we shallmove the second Reading of the Bill,,  of which I have given noticetoday, and thereafter,  in.priority to any other business, we shall make use of all the powers available to us for the purpose of passingthat Bill. Into law at the earliest possible date.      I will not pretend that the Free State Government were fully satisfied with this decisionor that they in any way receded from their view that the Bill shouldbe cassed into law forthwith, but I hope that nevertheless the:/ willbe able to satisfy their people that His Ma jesty&apos;s Government and theBritish peoole mean to keep faith with them and to afford no shadowof an excuse for the accusation that this country has been in any wayfalse to a Treaty solemnly entered into with the people of the IrishFree State .
After the adiournment of the House to-morrow therefore,we have until the 30th of next month before the second reading of the Bill.    His majesty1s Government most earnestly hope thatiii that interval the Government of iJorthern Ireland will see their way to appoint their representative on the Commission, and thereby to render the further progress of the Bill unnecessary.But let there be no mistake and no misunderstanding His Majesty&apos;sGovernment accepts the view that it is an honourable obligationundertaken by the people of Great, Bri tain towards the people ofthe Irish free State to secure that the Boundary Commission shallbe set up and  that its recommendations shall be made effective-by the Governments concerned.ihe issues of this question are grave.    They involvethe honour and the good faith of this country.    They  are. tooserious to be the sporo of party passions and politics,      i venture therefore to believe that it is not asking too much ofthe Iress and people of this country if I express the hope thatduring the interval until this House meets again they will refrain from any action which might awaken old suspicions or inflameold prejudicesc    It is,  I am sure,  the earnest hope of all of us that those suspicions and prejudices may before long be&apos;forgottenfor ever.
appendix ; II,POSITION OU Inter BORDillR.Colonel Spender, secretary to the Cabinet of NorthernIreland,  called at the Home Office on the morning of Tuesday,August,  6th, and said that Lord Londonderry and he had seenLord Gavan and had gathered from their conversation with him that Lord Cavan had no instructions to take action for theprotection of Northern Ireland in the event of a &quot;break&quot; occurringimmediatelyo      Colonel Spender urged that the possibility of immediate danger upon the Border should be envisaged and arrangementsmade for dealing with it.    In his opinion a Republic will certainlycome within the next few months and he thought the possibilitycould not be ignored of it being declared at once  (i0es on Tuesdaynight) if the negotiations then going on went badly.     As soonas the Cougrave Government falls Colonel Spender believes thatarmed bands might make incursions over the Border, and he represented that it was the duty of the Northern Government to do everythingwithin their power to protect their citizens against such a danger9He thought It unfair that northern Ireland should not know beforehandwhat their position would be in such a contingency, and urged thatthey ought to be told what action the British military would, or would not, take and what action the British Government would authorisethe Northern Government to take with their specials and police.In the cour-se of the conversation reference was mr de tothe danger of precipitate action and Colonel Spender said he quiteagreed that action should1 not be taken until it was inevitable;that the Northern Government would like to make.their preparationsbeforehand but that they recognised this was impossible because itmight precipitate the trouble they still hoped to avoid, and inview of the possibility of that trouble taking place immediatelyhe .wanted to come to some understanding at once as to the arr ang-ementsto be made, /..&apos;&apos;,
As the home Office Official was,  of course,   unable -&amp;to give Colonel Spender any information as to what action,if any, the British Government would take in the contingencyhe contemplated, Colonel Spender said he would send a ciphertelegram to Northern Ireland saying that while the HomeOffice thought Immediate trouble most unlikely he understoodarrangements had not been made by the British Government tomeet such a contingency and therefore the responsibility would presumably rest with the Northern Government.Colonel Spender called again this morning and said thatultimately yesterday he had not sent the telegram but had sentan express letter, he also said that Lord Londonderry   hadse,:Jr, Mr. Thomas this morning and that he and Lord Londonderrywere&apos; now going back to Northern Ireland to consult with sir James Crilg as tq the steps for keeping things quietthere at present; and that Lord Londonderry would write,officially raising the questions whioh had been raisedverbally by Colonel Spender as to the measures to be taken for the defence of the Border.Home Office.1   7th August,  1924,
