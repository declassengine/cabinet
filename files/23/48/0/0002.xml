UWEMELOYMSHT.&apos; (previous reference:Cabinet 18(24)j Oon-Nelusion 4.)2. Arising out of the discussion recorded inthe previous Conclusion on the Third Inter ire Report ofthe Cabinet Ooamittee, the Cabinet had a short discus-sion of a general character in regard to Unemployment.They were informed that, the attempts to relieve unemployment by applications to the Local Authoritieslargeto undertake/schemes which would have this effectwere tending to prove sterile- since the Local Authori-ties in many cases were coming to the end of their resources.    The most Important outstanding question at the present time was in regard to the Severn Barrage.The Terms of Reference to an Expert committee on thissubject were under consideration and would in due coursecome beforo the Cabinet Coirarjittee,The Cabinet wore informed that , apart fromHousing, the most hopeful line of advance in findingemployment was by inducing the Railway Companies tocontinue the process of electrifying suitable portions of the railways.The Cabinet agreed  (a)That the Committee on Unemployment andBousing should continue to explore allpossible.means of finding employment,more particularly in connection withthe Minister of Health1s Housing Scheme,which might employ considerable numbersof unskilled men in such work as the con-struction of roads and sewers, and inconnection with the electrification of railways:(b) That the President of the Board of Trade,as Chairman of the Cabinet Committee onUnemployment and Housing, should discuss with the Minister of Transport the best method of inducing the railways to expedite the process of electrification,with a view, if necessary and desirable,to the Prime &quot;Minister seeing the chairmen of the principal Railway Groups on thesubject.

SALES OFARMS ANDMUNITION.(previous reference:Cabinet 48(22), Con-elusion 3,)5.

PROPOSEDAMENDMENTM TEE&apos;LETTISHNORTHAMERICAACT i 1867.0,    The Cabinet had hefore them a Kote by theSecretary of State for the Colonies, covering aMemorandum on the subject of the proposed amendmentof Section 91 of the British North America Act, 1867(Paper CP.-235 (24)).The Cabinet wore asked to take note that theadoption of the proposals of the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies would involve some departure from theprinciple laid down in the Mcneod case in 1891, namely,that no Dominion or Colony could legislate beyond itsown borders, arm that the results might extend notonly to other Dominions besides Canada but even to canadian Provinces which had co-ordinate authority with the Dominion Government.    There was also thepossibility that the Opinion of the Lav- Officers ofthe late Government, of the 31st December, 1923, namely,that the true construction of Article 2 of the treaty between Great Britain and Ireland was that the censti-tutional relations between the United.Kingdom and theIrish Free State were to be those actually existing between the United Kingdom and Canada at the date of the signature of the Treaty, might be contested.    In that event difficulties might arise between Southern Irelandand Ulster as a result of the action now contearplated&apos; in regard to Canada,.whilst taking note of the above possibilities,the Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the proposal of the Secretaryof State for the Colonies, namely, that&quot; heshould inform the Canadian Government bydespatch that if the altered wording    &apos;&quot;   &apos;suggested by them (as given below) isembodied in an Address&quot;to Hie Majesty the. -King in substitution for that forwardedin 1920, His Majesty&apos;s Government willbe ready to take steps to introduce ameasure into Parliament amending theBritish North America Act in the manneragreed upon.
The formula proposed &quot;by the canadian government was as follows:-&quot;An enactment      the Parliament ofCanada if expressed to operate extra-territorially shall have, aid he deemedto have had, that operation if and insofar, as it is a law for or ancillary to thepeace, order and good, government ofCa,nada&quot;.(fa) That the Secretary of State for the Colonies- should consult the Law Officers &quot;before iritroduc-ing the necessary Bill-
7. The Postmaster-General informed his colleagues that, as previously arranged, the Cabinet Committeehad met the representatives of the Marconi Company onthe previous day.   Mr Marconi had informed the Committeeconfidentially of remarkable developments of a technica.1character in wireless telegraphy which he claimed weredestined to bring about a complete revolution in themethods hitherto employed for communicating by wirelesswith distant countries.    The Committee had ashed the marconi Company to forward detailed proposals in writingand intended to consider them immediately after Easter-The developments claimed were also to be examined intheir technical aspects by Dr. Socles and Mr Brown, thePost Office Experts.    The Cabinet committee hoped to beable to present a Report immediately after the EasterVacation.
8. The Minister of Labour informed his colleagues that there were several outstanding industrial disputesat the present time, and emphasized in particular aserious situation in regard to building and shipbuilding?as to which he gave his colleagues full particulars.He undertook to circulate a Memorandum in regard toother disputes.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to theevidence of Communist activity in connection with severalrecent strikes and disputes.The Cabinet,agreed  (a) To take note that the Minister of labour would furnish a Memorandum in regard tocertain existing and threatened tradedisputes:(b) That a Cabinet Committee j composed as follows the Lord Privy Seal (in the Chair),The Home Secretary,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Health,The Minister of Labour  should meet to enquire into the facts inregard to recent strikes, with a view to ascertaining whether any appreciablepercentage of the unfortunate aspectsof these strikes was due to Communistactivity.,;   industrial disputes.(previous reference:Cabinet 24(24), Con-conclusion  4.)
9o The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for India in regard to proposedprotective duties on steel imported into India? inolud-ing a telegram from the Government of India dated March23th, and a draft reply which had not yet been personallyrevised by the Secretary of State (Paper CP. -256 (24)).The Cabinet were informed that the Government ofIndia was pressing for a reply by the end of April,and that this question had been brought up as a matterof urgency, as there might be no further Meeting of theCabinet before April 29th.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to thefact that this Memorandum had only been circulated onthe previous Saturday, ana there had been no time for a proper examination of the far-reaching proposals of theGovernment of India.    They were reminded, however, that since the passing of the Government of India Act, 1919,successive Secretaries of State for India had madepronouncements in favour of what is known as-the estab-llshment of a &quot;Fiscal Autonomy Convention&quot;&apos;1 , which amountedto saying that they did not intj3nfl&apos;&apos;Texcept possibly on specific grounds irrelevant&apos;to the present question)ever to disallow&apos;any tariff measure favoured jointly bythe Government of India and their Legislature.    In thepresent instance there was every reason to believe that agreement between the Government of India and theirLegislature would be established.It was generally agreed that the draft replyattached to CP.-256 (24) tended to misrepresent theGovernment.&apos;s attitude, more particularly in regard-to protection and Imperial Preference,-.and did not providea satisfactory basis.
Tiie Cabinet agreed - .     - &apos;(a) That the Indian Coinvattee should meetto consider the draft reply to theViceroy&apos;s telegram of; March 28th:(b) That the Secretary of State for india should infoiiii the Viceroy that thequestion Was of such importance that,having regard to the Easter Vacation,the Cabinet could not make themselvesresponsible for despatching a replybefore April 50th.-14-
INDIA.fj The Forth-comingParliamentaryDebate.10.

Ths attention of the Cabinet was called3 asa matter of urgency, to Press attacks on the Governmenton the assumption that they intended to introduce legislation to repeal Part I of the Safeguarding ofIndustries Act.The Cabinet agreed  
i IMPERIAL*   ECONOMICCONFERENCE.(previous reference:Cabinet 19(24), Con-clusion 1CD)-)13.    The Cabinet had before then a Memorandum bytire Secretary of State for the Colonies covering aproof of a Parliamentary Paper setting out the positionof His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to the Resolu-tions of the Imperial Economic Conference and theTariff Preference proposals laid before the conference by the late Government (Paper CP.-252 (24)).The Prime Minister informed his colleagues thathe had communicated the Parliamentary Paper to MrBaldwin and Mr Asquith, and that the latter agreed tothe proposals contained therein for handling this busi-ness.The Cabinet agreedThat the Secretary of State for theColonies should have immediate authorityto lay the Parliamentary Paper enclosedwith his Note CP. -252 (24).

A P. P &amp; 1J D II___JtopROPOabffi^DRAffl&apos;. STATMlhT BI THB. MCilSTalR 01;&apos; health&amp;JCffiH aI em glad to have this opportunity of explaining to the House the steps which the Government have taken and theprogress they have, made in the preparation of their Housingproposals c.The broad results under the  scheme authorised by theHousing Act of 19 3 up to the 1st iipril are as follows8,140 houses have been completed;30,405 additional houses are under construction,while the contracts made or certificates issued by localauthorities cover a further 37,846 housesoThough they fully appreciate the efforts made bylocal authorities or private enterprise, the Government cannotregard the scheme of this Act as providing a solution of present difficulties or even as leading to a solution within a reason-able timecThe majority of the houses are -being built for sale.Comparatively little is being done for the great mass of thosewho are only able to pay a. rent,  and wecan see no prospect ofthis growing demand being met0    The Government therefore came to the conclusion that a broader policy was necessary and thatthey must endeavour to devise means which would lead to theprovision; in larger numbers and at a more rapid rate, ofhouses -built primarily for letting and not merely for selling,end that the rents should be such as the worker, let us say the man building the house,  is able to payoA true national policy should not only meet these points, but should provide means by which shortage will be overcome,  the growing needs will be met and unsatisfactoryhouses and slum conditions will be replaced by decent houses^,with-ithis end in view the Government invited theassistance of representatives of the Biiilding Industry and of
the manufacturers of &quot;building material.As a result the Government have received an extra-ordinar!l,y valuable report and I desire to express the thanksof the Government to all those in the industry who have spentso much time and skill in framing an industrial policy  tomeet the national needs.The main point to  be noted in the report is that theindustry have come to the conclusion that, on the basis of along term programme of house building, it can secure such anaugmentation of the building labour of the country as will ensure a. production of houses which will go far to meet theessential needs of not only keeping pace with the normaldemands,but of making good the present shortage and doingsomething effective to get rid of slum conditions.Without pledging itself to the detail of all therecommendations contained in the Report,  I am able to saythat the Government are prepared to accept the principle ofa long programme and are hopeful that this will command the-support of all parties in the House0It has been a fixed principle of all recent legisla-tion aiming at a solution of the housing problem, that thematter should be tackled on the basis of a partnership between the Government and the local authorities.   Accordinglyas soon as the industry were in a position to report as towhat was practicable I summoned a conference with the localauthorities-    I met representatives of the local authoritiesyesterday and explained to them the principles which it seemedto the Government necessary to observe,.    These I may sum upas followsThe provision of houses in numbers sufficient tomeet the needs I have described.-.The adoption of a long programme as a means ofsecuring the necessary augmentation of the resources  \
of the building industryBThe provision of houses for letting at rents withinthe capacity of the worker so the local authorities undertook to form a small committee to consider these principles and to go into thenecessary financial arrangements(.I hope to conclude the negotiations as soon aspossible after the Recess and to lay before the House ourcomplete proposals^ but the Government felt that it was due tothe House that we should describe as felly as possible thelines on which we are proceeding, and the progress we have beenable to make0
AJMDIX______IITHMSyKY.G IHGULAR TO THE lb BLIP SBAVICE.Draft in the form approved &quot;by Cabinet 27 (24) 4.Sir,I am directed by the Lords Commissioners of H.M. treasury to acquaint yon,  for the information of the Secretary of State,that H.M. Government have had under oareful consideration thequestion of insuring that the Cabinet - and Cabinet Committees -shall be invited to reach decisions only after the subjectreferred, to the Cabinet has been&apos; thoroughly examined betweeneach of the various Public.Departments concernedoThis elementary rule of business is essential if theCabinet and its Committees are to have available all the facts and points of view requisite for an enlightened, decision and areto be saved the possibility of hasty or uninformed conclusions.The observance of the rule is the more obligatory undermodern conditions when the mass of Government business has soenormously increased and as a consequence Governments can onlyget through it efficiently if the issxies presented for decisionhave been carefully investigated beforehand by the departments in collaboration.The Cabinet feels sure that Departments are anxious toassist it in securing the observance of this rule, and hascome to the conclusion that the desired object will be facili-tated by the following procedure.    In future all memoranda, draftBills and other constituents of the Agenda will be sent to theCabinet Secretariat for/Permanent Under secretary of State.
circulation only after their subject -matter has beenfully examined between the departments from which theyemanate, the Treasury, the Law Officers where contentiousBills are involved, and any other Department concerned,and these documents will tear on the face of them a specific statement that this examination has taken place.The documents should be made as complete as possible bycontaining the various arguments and criticisms which mightbe brought against the proposals advocated.     To enable themembers.... of the Cabinet (and Cabinet Committees) to h:-vetime to consider proposals intended for Cabinet decision and in view also of the possibility that such inter-departmentalexamination may result in definite differences of opinionnecessitating the preparation of memoranda by the dissentingDepartment or departments, no memoranda, draft Bills,etc. whichoriginate proposals for Cabinet decision will be placed on theAgenda tuit.il an interval of -e^crwo-ofe has elapsed -after circula-tion, except on any occasion when the Prime Minister expresslyauthorises a relaxation of the rule.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,H.F.WARREN EISHFE.
