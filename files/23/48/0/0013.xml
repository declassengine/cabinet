(This - Document is the Property of His Britannic^   ^   ^ ... &quot;Ifagesty^s ^pverme^ET)SECRET-CABINST 38 (24)CONCLUSIONS of a Meeting of the Cabinet,held at 10, Downing Street, S.W.1, onWEDNESDAY, JUNE 18, 1924, at 11 a.AuFOREIGN POLICY. 1.    The Prime Minister, as Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, made a general statement to the Cabineton various questions of Foreign Policy.(previous reference:Cabinet 31(24), Con-elusion lo )FRANCE.Reparation.(previous reference:Cabinet 31The Prime Minister said he had just heard thatM. Herriot, the new French President of the Council,expected to arrive in England on Sunday morning for a personal discussion with him.    He proposed to cover much(24), Con- ,elusion 1.)   the same ground as in his meeting with the BelgianPrime Minister and Foreign Minister.    On the conclusionof his visit M. Herriot intended to proceed to Belgium.After that it was probable that a meeting of Allied PrimeMinisters would take place, he. hoped in London, but analternative suggestion had been made that the Report ofQ the First (Dawes) Committee of Experts should be put inoperation prior to a Conference if a sufficient measureof agreement could be arrived at. He doubted, however,if this was practicable.
GERMANY.Disarmamentof.ftjrovlousReference:Cabinet 55(23), Con-conclusion  4.)MOSUL.(previous reference:Cabinet 3(24)i Con-clusion 1(a)THE IRAQTREATY.(previous reference:Cabinet 29(24), Con-,elusion 2.)EGYPT.(previous reference:Cabinet 31(24), Oon-(plusion 1.)MEXICO.If M. Her riot were to brine: up the question ofdisarniaitent of Germany, it would be dealt with separately from the question of reparation by Germany.    The PrimeMinister&apos;s policy was to aim at winding up the Inter-Allied Commission of Control set&apos; up under Part V, Section4, of the Treaty of Versailles, without breaking withour Allies, and, if possible, to place the whole matter in the hands of the League of Nations as part of ageneral agreement in regard to disarmament.   A step inthis policy had just been taken by the Lord Presidentof the Council, as British Representative at the Councilof the League of Nations, in obtaining the referenceto a Committee of Jurists of a question relating to thedisarmament of Austria, Bulgaria and Hungary.The Prime Minister took this opportunity toinform the Cabinet that the British Government had. not,as stated in the Press, asked the Turks to give up the) Vilayet of Mosul.    The;/ had only asked for a delimitationof the boundary in favour of Iraq, based partly on strategic and partly on racial considerations (e. g. , toinclude the Assyrian Christians within the territory,of Iraq).     In this connection the Prime Minister informed his colleagues that the Iraq Constituent Assembly hadratified the Treaty, and that one of their riders wasthat the British Government should secure a properfrontier.The Prime Minister had little to add to theposition in regard to the Egyptian negotiations.    ZaghlulPasha appeared to be manoeuvring for position beforecommitting himself definitely .to come to London.The Prime Minister ^ve a summary of -the events which had led up to the present difficulty with the mexican Government.    When he himself took office, Great
Britain was represented in Mexico by a. gentleman namedMr Cummins, who was not on very good terms with thede facto Government.    Before natters came to a crisis,however, the Prime Minister had arranged to send outSir Thomas Hohler, who was persona grata with theMexicans, and had undertaken that on his arrivalMr. Cummins should be withdrawn.    The position had become acute, however, as the result of an appeal madeby Mr Cummins on behalf of a British subject, a Mrs.Evans, who owned a property of which the mexican government desired to obtain possession.    This had brought about a crisis, and the Mexican Governmenthad threatened to expel Mr Cummins and had blockadedthe Legation.    The Prime Minister had been In consulta-tion with the American Ambassador, and the latest phase of the question was that Mr Cummins would probably leavethe Legation today under American protection.    In presentconditions there was no intention of sending out sir thomas Hohler.   He anticipated that it would take tineto clear up this situation.
