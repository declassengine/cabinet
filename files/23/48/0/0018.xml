The Prime Minister made a statement to hiscolleagues regarding the progress of the Inter-allied conference.    He said that three Committees had beenappointed.    The First Committee, under the chairmanship of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, was dealing.with thequestion of the guarantees necessary to secure the snb-scription of the International Loan provided for in the dawes Report.    The Second Committee, under the Chairman-ship of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, was considering the arrangements for the economic and mili-tary evacuation of the Ruhr and the restoration of german economic fiscal unity.    The Third Committee, of-which sir Robert Kindersley had acted as Chairman, had dealtwith the arrangements to be made in countries receivingreparation in order to enable them to absorb the repara-tion paid, whether in scrip or in hind, without dangereither to the countries themselves or to the internationalvalue of the German currency.      The First Committee hadpresented a Report, which, unfortunately, had leakedinto the Press and had had to be published.    The SecondCommittee had met with great difficulties and was still
considering the questions referred to it.    The ThirdCommittee had presented an agreed Report on the pointhe had referred to above, but had disagreed in regard tothe scope of their Terms of Reference.In addition, as the members of the cabinet would have seen from the Press, the Heads of Delegationswere meeting every day.    He wished to make quite clearthat the Heads of Delegations were not an ExecutiveComr.oJ.ttee nor a Conference;    they merely met to discussthe difficulties reached &quot;07/ the various Committees ofthe Conference on the previous day^    they took no decisions, agreed to no resolutions, and adopted no conclusions.    They did, however, raise various points which required consideration.Today, for example, the Heads of Delegations had discussed the attitude to be adopted as regards theGermans.    Some wanted to bring the Germans in to theConference in the full position of negotiators;    othersdid not desire this at all and said that their publicopinion would not tolerate it.    One suggestion had beenthat the negotiations with the Germans should be conducted through the medium of the Reparation Conmis-sion.   What he himself had proposed, in order to escape from this dilemma, was that as soon as the Allies had agreed among themselves the Germans should be asked tocome to London and to meet them in a Plenary Conferenceat which they would hand in their comments on the pro--posals made to them.    These comments would then be remitted to a Committee, on which the Germans would berepresented.    The Committee&apos;s Report would be considered at another mooting of the Plenary Conference.    this procedure would be identical with that adopted by the
Allies themselves, and would save the face of Franceand Belgium to a certain extent.    The Prime ministers aid that he had undertaken to report this proposal tothe Cabinet;    if they approved, he would put it inwriting, and, without circulating anything, would readit to the Heads of Delegations at their meeting on the morrow.   Meantime, they were to think over the proposal.In the course of the subsequent discussion theChancellor of the Exchequer ira.de a statement in regardto the work of the First Committee.    The question had arisen as to whether &quot;the Report ^rould provide sufficientsecurity to induce subscriptions to the proposed Loan.He arid some of his colleapues on the First Committeehad met the bankers, privately at the House of commons on the previous day.   The bankers had made it clear thatthey objected to the extent of the authority left to theReparation Commission under the proposals in the Reportof the First Committee.    They had scouted the idea of a loan if the French continued the military occupation ofthe Ruhr.    They had expressed themselves as particularly anxious in record to the claim of the French Governmentto retain the right to take Independent sanctions.The French Minister of Finance had taken up a very diffi-cult position.    He had said that It would be fatal tothe French Government if it -ot about that France had given up her right to take independent action, and hehad displayeci no change of spirit in regard to the present negotiations.    He had spoken continually of the untrust-worthiness of Germany, and of the French apprehensions.M. Theunis had pointed out that the service of the Loanrequired only a small sum as compared with the total amount required for reparation.    The Chancellor of the
Exchequer had then pointed out that this was not thereal point.   What was required was a feelinp: in theinvesting countries that a new deal was being made,that the mistakes of the past were recognised, and thatthe Dawes Report was being used as an opportunity to start afresh and to establish   good feeling betweenthe Allies and Germany-   Mr Lazuont, the Americanbanker, of Pierpont Morgan &amp; Co. , had said that thiswas the real point, and that unless that change of feeling occurred he could not have any responsibilityfor underwriting the Loan.    In the course of the dis-cussion it had come out that Prance expected the UnitedStates of America and Great Britain to supply the Loan,and would supply very little herself.The Secretary of State for the Colonies gave an account of the difficulties&apos; encountered in theSecond Committee, particularly in regard to the demandsof the French to retain 4,000 railway men in the Ruhreven after the Dawes Report came into operation.The Prime Minister explained that the British empire delegation was meeting daily.    Owing to the volumes of papers circulated to the Cabinet in regard to theConference, ha had not given instructions to circulate the Minutes in addition, but of course any member ofthe Cabinet could have them who might so desire.After considerable discussion the cabinet agreed  (a) That, while adhering to the viewrepeatedly expressed by the LabourParty that in&apos; all nejjotiations betweenthe Allies and the Germans the latter should be treated In ever;,&quot; way as equals,in order to avert a possible breakdown of the Confeience they would aeoep., theproposal that when the Allies had agreed
on their proposals the (remans should he invited to aPlenary Conference at which they -should hand in their replies to theproposals of the Allies;    their observations would then be remitted to a Committee, on which the G-eriianswould be represented, and which would report to the Plenary Conference;Cb) That any member of the Cabinet who wished to see the Minutes of theBritish Empire Delegation should notify the Secretary of the Cabinet,.who would be responsible for fumish-ing copies.

Reference was made to the Very Secret Notecirculated by Mr Ponsonby in rerard to the Anglo-Soviet Conference on the 21st July, 1924, but thePrime Minister explained that as the&apos;    Note    had only been circulated on the previous day it would not be consistent with the rules of the Cabinet to discuss it today, nor could iv be discussed in Mr Ponsonby1 sabsence.The Cabinet a,greed -That the Secretary should place thesubject on the Agenda for the next meeting, and that Mr Ponsonby shouldbe summoned to attend.

The Cabinet had before them the Report of aJoint Committee on the Sittings of Parliament (H.0.112)(Paper CP. -400 (24)).It was pointed out that the principal recommen--dation of the Joint Committee, was in paragraph 18, whereit was proposed that Parliament should, each Session,be adjourned on or, if possible, before the Slst Julyif it has not by then completed the business of the session, and that it should meet again In the Autumnto finish such business as still remained to be completed before the end of the year.
