Poincare&quot;&apos; cancelling his proposed visit toChequers on May 19th.   After the aseting at Chequers withthe Belgian Ministers and the subsequent receipt of a
message from M. Polncare (through Lord Or ewe) intimatingthat he would he glad to come to England, the PrimeMinister had felt it advisable to send the french president of the Council an invitation.    As M. Poincare&quot;had accepted, he could not possibly object to his successor in office receiving a similar invitation.While there was general regret that the courseof the elections in Prance had rendered unavoidable acertain amount of delay in a meeting between theBritish Prime Minister and the French President of theCouncil, the Cabinet agreed  (a) To place on record their appreciation of the handling of the situation bythe Prime Minister up to the present ,time, including&apos; the Conversations withthe Belgian Ministers at Chequers ^ andthe invitation sent to M. Poincare&quot; tocome to Chequers:(b) That it was desirable that the PrimeMinister should send an invitation tothe new French President of the council as soon as he takes office, with a viewto an early meeting, although it was recognised that this would probably not take place for some weeks if M. Polncare&quot;carried out his intention of not resign-ing before June 1st:Co) To concur with the Prime Minister that,on receipt of an official&apos;communication from Mo Poincare that his visit to Chequerswas postponed, he would be well advised to write a private and cordial letter in reply?expressing regret that he was not to havethe pleasure of receiving M. Poincare&quot; and establishing personal relations with him: -(d) To approve the proposal adumbrated by thePrime Minister in the course of theChequers Conversations that an &quot;appointed day&quot; should be arranged, on which auto-matically certain events should takeplace, such as the entering into forceof the German measures under the schemeof the Committee of Experts, as well as of the measures of control, the annulmentof the vs,serious coercive measures taken under decree by the Rhineland High Coin-mission, and tide withdrawal of Prance andBelgium from the Ruhr.
The Balkans.The Prime Minister, as Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, made a short statement in regard tothe position in the Balkans.   Bis policy had been,whenever a Mote was addressed to the Serbian orBulgarian Government&apos;in re gird to the frontier andother troubles which had arisen from time to time between those two States, to address the other Oovsrn-ment at the same time.Egypt.(previous reference:Cabinet 30(24), Con-conclusion  1.)The Prime Minister, as Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, explained the difficulty of making any announcement in Parliament in regard to Egypt.If he announced that the Government stood, by theirDeclaration of February, 1922, it was interpreted inEgypt as tantamount to a refusal to negotiate.    TheEgyptian Government insisted on the surrender of theSudan.    He had sent a message to Zaghlul Pasha in whichwithout indicating any concession, he made it clearthat any discussions on the subject of Egypt would beunfettered in their scope.

The Lord Privy Seal brought to the attentionof the Cabinet, as a matter of urgency, the questionof the demand which had been made at a meeting of theExecutive of the Labour Party for the reinstatement ofmen dismissed from the Police and Prison Service inconnection with the Strike of 1919.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to their previous decision on the subject, as referred to in the margin, which was that the Cabinet could not assume theresponsibility of approving the reinstatement of thedismissed strikers.Referenoe was also made to certain inquirieswhich were being made on the subject by the Ministerof Education and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.The question was discussed as to whether thedemand for reinstatement could not be met by an explana-tion tliat this course could not be carried in the presentHouse of Commons, coupled with an undertaking to make amost synipathetic inquiry into the possibility of the gradual absorption of the men into other branches ofGovernment service, and other steps for ameliore/tingtheir position.    It was pointed out, however, that thepresent demand was practically confined to reinstatement.The Cabinet agreed -That the Prime Minister, the Lord Privy-Seal, and the Home Secretary, should seerepresentatives of the Executive of theLabour Party In the Prime Minister&apos;s room at the House of Commons at 6-30 the same evening.
