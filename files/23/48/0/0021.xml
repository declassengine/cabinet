(This Document is the Property of His BritannicMajesty&apos; s Government&apos;.)o   TP   n  &quot;O        m  -previous l/v -elusion 4. )CABINET 46  (24).CONCLUSIONS of a Meeting of the Cabinet,held in the Prime Minister&apos;s Room, Houseof Commons , on MONDAY, AUGUST 4, 1924,at 5 p.m.IRISH The Cabinet were informed that, following theBOUNDARYCOMMISSIQN.       consultation with the Opposition Leaders agreed to atthe previous Meeting, representatives of Northern and southern Ireland had been invited to London.    The PrimeCabinet 45(24) , Con-        Minister, Home Secretary and Colonial Secretary had seenLord Londonderry and Mr Pollock, representing theGovernment of Northern Ireland (in the evbsence of SirJanes Craig through illness) with Mr Cos grave and hisAttorney-General representing Southern Ireland.    Theserepresentatives had been apprised of the exact situation,including the Report of the Judicial Committee of the privy Council, and of the intention of His majesty&apos;s government to pass a one-Clause Bill to give effect toa new agreement.    Mr Cos grave had been informed in confidence that the Government1s intention was to intro-duce the Bill on Wednesday, August 6th, and to force it through all its stages after the adjournment.Mr Cosgrave had replied, in equal confidence,that he did not think he could hold the situation inIreland, (which was aggravated by the two years1 delay
in settling the boundary) if two months were allowed toelapse before the enaotment of the Bill.   He had airnjority of only ten in the bail, and there were someforty members belonging to different Parties who had never taken their seats in the Dail because they hadconscientious objections to taking the oath.   Mr Cos gravehad reason to believe that, if the Bill was not iraaedi-ately forced through Parliament, Mr Tom Johnson, the leader of the Opposition in the Dail, would propose aresolution to the effect that this constituted a viola-tion of the Treaty and that members should be free totake the oath or not.    Mr Cos grave would then resign, andMr Tom Johnson would become President of the ExecutiveCouncil.    Thus the Dail would become a revolutionaryParliament and the issue of an Irish Republic would cometo a heed in Imperial Parliament.Mr Cos rave had then been informed that, if theGovernment tried to force the Bill through, at once, ashe desired, the House of Lords would almost certainlyreject or hold it up,by adjourning or otherwise. Thiswould probably precipitate an irmiediate General election in the holiday season and in circumstances highly disad-yantageous to the present Government.    Further, that, bythe attempt, to pass a Bill now, very serious trouble wouldbe created in   Ulster, and the -prospect at present heldout, that Northern Ireland, if given time, might appoint a Commissioner and thus, avert the need for legislation,would be rendered null and void.After prolonged-discussions, Mr Cosgrave had undertaken to recommend the following- proposals to hisGovernment
(l) In order to show their good faith, theBritish Government should ask Parliamentto re-as seuto le on Ootober 14th insteadof Ootoher 28th j as previously intended:(a) The Prime Minister should send Mr Cos gravea letter he could read to the Dail when that Chamber re-assembled on August 12th.A letter had now been reoeived from Mr Cosgravestating that, v/hile the draft Agreement supplmentingArticle 12 of the Treaty had been approved and signedand the naoessary legislation to give effeot to itwould he introduced in the Dail, it was essential thatthe requisite legislation should &quot;be enaoted in thiscountry before Parliament rises (Appendix l).In the oourse of the discussion the cabinet were warned that, if the proposal to foroe the bill through before Parliament rises was rejected, therewas a very serious risk that a Republic would &quot;bedsolared in Southern Ireland during the recess.   Itwas agreed, however, that even this very serious riskwas outweighed by the practical certainty that theBill, if pressed, would he rejected or held up by theHouse of Lords;   that a General Election might have tohe undertaken under unfavourable conditions;   and, above all, that all possibility of a successful result tothe efforts being made to induce the Government ofNorthern Ireland to appoint a Commissioner a few weekshence would be destroyed.-   In these circumstances the Cabinet agreed(a) To authorise the Prime Minister to sign the Agreement,. which had already been signed by Mr Cos grave.(The Prime Minister signed theAgreement in duplicate -Appendix II   one copy to he retained in the Colonial Offioeand one handed to Mr Cos gravesee below (o).)
Cb) To approve the attached letter (the last paragraph of which was amended by theCabinet) from the Prime Minister toMr Cos grave.(The letter in Appendix III was signed by the Prime Minister for communication to Mr Cos grave  see below (c).)(c) That the Home Secretary and colonial secretary should proceed the same eveningto Dublin to communicate to Mr Cos gravethe documents referred to above in (a)and Cb.)., and with a view to further discussion with Mr Cosgrave and hisGovernment.    They should have full authority from the Cabinet, after explaining the situation in full detail?to do their best to persuade the ExecutiveCouncil of the Irish Free State that itwas in their own interest to adhere tothe procedure already proposed to MrCos grave In London.,    In the last resortthey should have authority to discussthe possibility of Parliament beingashed to re-assemble as early as Septemberfor the purpose of enacting the legislation required to carry the Agreement into effect,but they should reserve any decision on thesubject for the Cabinet.    They should also have authority, if they desired (and moreparticularly if any question was raised in regard to the presence of the HomeSecretary) to intimate that possibly theymight have to proceed together at some later date to discuss-the&quot; matter with theGovernment of Northern Ireland.(d) That the Secretary of State for the colonies should circulate a Memorandum to the Cabinetin regard to the speeches delivered byMr Chamberlain and Lord Birkenhead&apos;as towhat the work of the Boundary CoEimissionwas to be, if and when it met.(e) That, in vie-   of the immediate departure of the Secretary of State, the Secretaryof the Cabinet should remind the ColonialOffice to see that notice was given of theintroduction of the Irish Bill&quot;onWednesday, August 6th.
Saorstat hireann,The President^&quot;Office,Upper Merrion Street,Dublin.3rd August, 1924.the Right Hon. J, lismsay iiiacdonald,M.P.,pear, Mr. Prime Minis ter,Immediately on my return this morning,  I held a lengthyconsultation with my colleagues regarding the matters which we discussed yesterday.The draft Agreement supplementing Article 12 of theIreaty was considered and meets with our approval.      I was accordingly authorised to affix my signature to it on behalfof the Government of the Irish Free State,    when the Dail re-Kssemhles on the 12th inst. ,swe will introduce the legislativemeasure necessary for its ratification, and press it to a conclusionMy colleagues and I have given earnest consideration to the representations made to me that as the British Parliament would inthe ordinary  course adjourn this week it would meet the conveniencefHis MajestyTs Government that the corresponding legislation in&amp;at Parliament, which you are introducing on vvednesday next,should await the reassembly of Parliament in October for thecompletion of its remaining stagea.      This course does not commend itself to us.I have already in previous communications acquainted?ou of the grave apprehensions which have been aroused in thisCountry by the delays that have occurred in giving effect toHide 12 of the Treaty.    Recent developments have not tended.to allay these apprehensions.    Suggestions have been made inDail and elsewhere that faith is not being kept with our0Ple, and my Government would fail in their duty were they
to acquiesce in any proceeding which, would tend to aggravatefeeling of this nature.    Any avoidable delay in dealing withthe problem which now confronts His kajesty Ts Government wouldcertainly increase dissatisfaction and foster distrust, andwe accordingly urge most strongly upon you in the interestsof both Countries that a prompt settlement of this matter is imperative.I must therefore on behalf of my Government earnestlyrepresent to you that it is essential that the legislationrequisite on the part of Ris iia jes ty1 s Government to giveeffect to our Agreement shall be enacted before Parliamentrises.Sincerely yours,Signed by President Cosgravein Irish characters.
. WHEREAS the Commissioners to be appointed under thesaid Article Twelve by the- Government of the Irish Free Stateand bv the British Government respectively have been dulyappointed by those respective Governments, but the GovernmentNorthern Ireland has declined to appoint the Commissioner tobe so appointed by that Government, and no provision is madeby the said Articles for such a contingency:SOW it is hereby agreed,  subject to  the confirmation of this Agreement by the British Parliament and the Oireachtasof the Irish Free State, that if the Government of NorthernIreland does not before the date of the passing of the Act ofthe British Parliament or of the Act of the Oireachtas of theIrish Free State confirming this Agreement, whichever is the later date, appoint the Commissioner to be so appointed bythat Government,  the power of the Government of NorthernIreland to appoint such Commissioner shall thereupon betransferred to and exercised by the British Government, andthat for the pnrposes of the said Article any Commissionerso appointed by the British Government shall be deemed tpbe a Commissioner appointed by the Government of NorthernIreland, and that the said Articles of Agreement for aTreaty shall have effect accordingly.Signed on behalf of the Signed on behalf of theBritish Government. Government of the IrishFree state:RAMSAY MacHONNAID. by President Cosgravein Irish characters.Agreement supplementing Article Twelve of the Articles ofAgreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland towhich the force of law was given by the irish Free State(Agreement) Act, 1922, and by the Constitution of the IrishFree State  (Saorstat Eireann) Act, 1922,
APPENDIX III.LETTER FROM THE PRIME MINISTER TO THEPRESIDENT&apos; OF THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL OPAugust 4,  1924.Sir, - ,I enclose herewith, duly signed by me on behalf of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, one copy of the Agreement supplernentingArticle -12 of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty betweenGreat Britain and Ireland, which was signed by you, in duplicate,on the 2nd Instant.It will be observed that this Agreement is subject to confirm-ation by the British Parliament and by the Oireachtas of theIrish Free State, and that it has been so drafted, by youradvisers and mine in consultation, that until it has been soconfirmed by both Pa 1 laments it remains open to the Government ofNorthern Ireland to exercise the power of appointing a Commissionerconferred upon that Government by the original Articles of Agree-me iit.It is further understood between the two Governments that shouldthe Government of Northern Ireland exercise that power within thetime Within which it Is open to that Government to do so, it willbe unnecessary that the steps for the confirmation of this Agree-&quot;merit by the two Parliaments should be completed..In the opinion of His Majesty1s Government, it is on the onehand desirable that a sufficient period should elapse before thefinal confirmation of the Agreement by both Parliaments to enablethe present situation to be fully considered by the Governmentand people of Northern Ireland, and on the other hand it is neoes-sary that this peiiod should be defined as precisely as possiblein order that the present situation may not be indefinitelyprolonged.His Majesty&apos;s Government propose therefore to Introduce a bill into Parliament giving the force of law to the Agreement onWednesday next, the 6th Instant, and to obtain the first Reedingof that Bill before the Adjournment,    Parliament will then becalled together&apos; on the 14th of October next, instead of on the28th as has hitherto been arranged.    On that date the Governmentwill move the second Reading of the Bill, and win thereafter give priority to the Bill, in all its stages, over any other business,and use whatever powers are necessary to pass it into law.His Majesty&apos;s Government accepts your vie-r that It is anhonourable obligation undertaken by the people of this countrytowards the people of the Irish Free State to secure that the boundary Commission shall be set up and that its recommendations should be made effeo/tive by the Governments concerned.I have the honour to be,Sir, -      /Your most obedient,, humble servant, /&apos;     &apos;.&apos; t - &amp;    -. ;::,&quot;nv -v.-;&apos; mm,&apos; &apos; /(&quot;Signe.. ) J.
