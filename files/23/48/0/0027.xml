(This Document ia the Property of His Britannic*^Ma*3 e s ty1 s QoSrernmentr;B &quot;i-SECRET-(84).CONCLUSIONS of. a Meeting of the Cabinet,held at 10, Downing Street, S.W.1, onMONDAY, OCTOBER 6, 1924, at 3 p.m.PRE &quot;WORKERS1WEEKLY&quot; PRO-SECUTION.(previous reference:Cabinet 48(24), Con-conclusion 5.)1. After a discussion, in which the Attorney-Generaland the Chief Whip took part, on the subject of theforthcoming Debate in Parliament on the abandonment ofthe prosecution of the Acting Editor of &quot;The Workers&apos;Weekly&quot;, the Cabinet agreed  (a) To take note of the Prime Minister&apos;intention to make a personal statement in Parliament Immedlately before the debate, in order to remove any ambiguity,which might have been occasioned by^theterms of his answer on September 30thto a Private Notice Question by SirKings ley Wood, in regard to the extentof his cognizance of the Attorney-General&apos;decision to withdraw the proceedings against &quot;The Workers&apos; Weekly&quot;: -(b) That the Liberal.Amendment must beregarded as a &quot;Vote of Censure no less. than the Conservative Motion, insomuch asIt proposed to put the honour of theGovernment in the hands of a partisanCommittee composed of seven opponents of the Government and only three supporters.Consequently the general policy of theGovernment should be to onioo;both theConservative Motion and the LiberalAne-ndment:(c) That, in execution of this policy, the- Government should invite their supporterseithnr to vote &quot;aye&quot; upon, or to abstain
from voting on (according to which,course right appear best suited tothe exigencies of the moment), thefirst Motion to be put from the chair, namely, &quot;That the words tobe left out stand put&quot;.    Theeffeot of this course, if successful,would be to rule out the LiberalAmendment, and to confront- theGovernment with the ConservativeVote of Censure, which the Govern-ment.&apos; s supporters would of courseoppose.    In the event, however,of the Conservative Party notsupporting the Motion from the chair &quot;That.the words to be left. out;stand put&quot;, the Liberal Amend-ment Would then be taken first., andthe Governments supporters should beasked to oppose it:(d) That, if either the Conservative Vote, of Censure or the Liberal amendment should be carried, the Prime minister should advise the King to dissolveParliament:(e) That the Government should not offer some less partisan foma of alternativeinquiry by a Royal Commission, by theJudicial CoiiJi-rdttee of the Privy Council,or a Judge.   The latter course wasadvocated by the Attorney-General, whoasked that his view might be recorded,but the general view was that neitherform of inquiry was consistent with government responsibility upon policy or upon the action of a Minister acting on his own ^ud^nent on a matter for whichhe is constitutionally responsible:(f) That it would not be a desirableprecedent to announce the decisionof the Cabinet in the Cabinet communique&apos;without first obtaining the King&quot; s consent,but that the Chief Whip should be author-is ed to let it be known that the intentionof the Government was to oppose both theConservative Motion and the LiberalAmendment, and that&apos;members of theGovernment should adopt the saasse course in any public statements they night haveoccasion to make before the Debate:(g) That the Attorney-General should replyto the Conservative speakers in supportof the Vote of Censure, and that thePrime Minister should reply to theLiberal speakers in support of the Amend-aaent.   The Home Secretary should beprepared to speak In the course ot the debate, and the Secretary of State forthe&apos; Colonies should wind up the Debatefor the Government:
