(Tills Document.is the Property of His Britannic&apos; Majesty&apos;s Government* )T -CABINET 57 (24).CONCLUSIONS of a Meeting of the Cabinet,held in the Prime Minister&apos;s Room,   Houseof Commons, S.W.1, on FRIDAY, JUNE 6th,1924, at 1 p.m.The Cabinet met, as a matter of urgency, toconsider the situation arising out of a sudden strike on the Underground and Great Western Railways.The Minister of Labour informed his colleagues of the following facts in regard to the situation.The National Union of Railwaymen had reoently enteredinto negotiations with certain of the Railway Companies,namely, the Great Western Railway and the UndergroundRailways, in regard to the wages of shopmen.    On the17th May a letter had been sent without warning to theCompanies concerned by an unofficial Committee, whohad demanded a reply at very short notice on toe mattersunder discussion between the National Union of railwaymen and the Companies.    To this letter the Companies had replied that they were dealing direct with the NationalUnion of Railwaymen and could not give an answer to the unofficial Committee.   This Committee had then called astrike, and -there had been a considerable stoppage.The difficulty of the Ministry of Labour arose from thefact that the National Union of Railwayman did not recog-nise the strikes while the Companies also refused tonegotiate with the representatives of the strikers,
on the ground that they were in negotiation with theUnion.   There were the usual complications arisingout of the fact tha-t members of Graft Unions were working alongside the railwaymen.   No Union, however,either of the craftsmen or of the railwaymen, wouldhave anything to do with the strike as such.   Therewas some reason to believe,, however, that theSecretary   of the Electrical Trades Union wascontemplating giving official recognition to thestrike.   At present about two-thirds of the powerproduction of Lots Road station had ceased, andtwo-thirds of the trains on the Underground Railwayshad stopped running.   The opinion of the NationalUnion of Railwaymen was that the situation was not likely to improve before Monday or Tuesday, when an accelerated service might be possible.The Cabinet consulted the Lord Advocate in person, and the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for home Affairs, by telephone, as to whether naval ratings could be put into the power-stations to runthem,in case of necessity, without the issue of anEmergency Proclamation.    They were informed that thenecessary legal powers existed, but that in the past the Admiralty had wished to avoid using naval ratingsin this way before the issue of an Emergency Proclama-tion.    In the circumstances of the moment, however,it was felt that, if absolutely necessary, theGovernment should not refrain from calling on thenaval personnel.
After a discussion of the above situation, theCabinet agreed  (a) That the Minister of Labour shouldmake a firm statement in the Houseof Commons explaining that thedispute had not arisen out of theordinary working arrangements of organised Labour and Capital, andthat the Government did not recogniseit.   He should have authority, if hethought fit, to sa,y that if societywas subjected to this sort of strikeit would be paralysed.     If askedas to whether the Government wouldprotect persons remaining at work,and others who wished to &quot;assist tokeep the public services going, heshould reply in the affirmative.He should make it clear that theGovernment were not prepared to takeover the running of the trains, whichwas a responsibility conferred on theRailway Companies by Act of Parliament,but that the Government regarded it as its first duty to maintain law andorder.   Mr Shaw should be authorisedto state, however, that the Govern-raent would not allow such essential services as lighting to be inter-rupted, and that if this was threatenedthey would take steps to keep the power stations in operation:(b) That the Minister of Labour should have authority to intimate to the Secretaryof the Electrical Trades Union theintention of the Government to maintainlighting and essential services.(c) That the First Lord of the admiralty should warn his Department that naval ratings might be required at short notice for the purpose of keeping the electrical installations at LotsRoad (and possibly elsewhere) in opera-tion, and that the First Lord should keep in touch with the Home secretary with a view to meeting the requirementsof the situation.(d) That the following Emergency Committeeshould hold itself in readiness to meet at short notice  - The Home Secretary,- The Secretary of State for V/ar,- The First Lord of the Admiralty,^ The Postmaster-General,to concert and authorise such steps as might be necessary.-3-
(e) That the Secretary should warn the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster, as Chief Civil Conmis-sioner, to hold himself in readiness to return to London at short notice on receipt of a telegram, if thisshould he deemed necessary.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,June 6, 1924.
