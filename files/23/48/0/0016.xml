The Prime Minister made a abort statement to theCabinet In regard to the forthcoming Inter-Allied Confer-ence in London on Reparation.   His intention was, &quot;mliter^M^BBSK^BBB^ to limit the discussions at the Conference .I forthcoming conference &quot;In London.(previous reference:labi-net 29(24), Gon-iilusion 1.Ito the one question of the method of putting the DawesReport into operation.As regards representation of the British Govern-ment, the Prime Minister said that he and the Chancellorof the Exchequer would have to be two of the represented-tives.   The Secretary of State for the Colonies was atthat moment in consultation with the High commissioners of the Dominions in regard to Dominions representation.Count Peretti della Rocca, of the French Foreign Office,had been nominated as one of the French representatives,and the Marquess della Torretta was to be one of theItalian representatives.    In these circumstances, and inview of the many highly technical issues involvedj he proposed to place the Permanent Under-Secretary of theForeign Office on the same footing as the French andItalian delegates mentioned above.&apos;Some discussion took place as to the desirabilityof including a permanent official amone the delegates
of a Conference to consider questlore of large policy.It was a.greed  (a) To leave      to the Prise Minister tosettle the composition of the british delegation after hearing the reportof the Secretary of State for theColonies in regard to Dominionsrepresentation:(b) That the Chancellor of the Exohequershould have fall authority to arrangefor such Experts as he might require vwhether for the Conference itself orfor purposes of consultation duringthe conference including, if hethought fit, Sir Robert Kindersleyand Sir Josiah Stamp, who-had beenthe British Representatives on theD aw es C ormi s si on.

The Lord Chancellor informed the Cabinet thathe had given considerable attention to the improvementof the Bench, from which working men and women were nolonger excluded, as In the past.   Good progress hadbeen made, and he was insisting on the Labour Partyhaving the same status on the Bench as other Parties.The greatest care was being devoted to the selection of suitable men and women as Ha gist rate s, and thatinvolved refusing people who themselves&apos; brought,the lawinto contempt by/such acts as pa&amp;&amp;3^yjke-G1stanCT,refusal to administer the Vaccination Acts, etc.So long as a Magistrate undertook to fulfil the law,no notice was taken of any opinions he might hold.    Itwas only where the law was defied that difficulty arose.In the course of a somewhat prolonged, discussion on the subject, strong views were express sc^against theremoval of liagistrates from the Bench owing to passiveresist tine .    The general trend of opinion in the cabinet was that,so long as a Magistrate administered the lawfaithfully in other respects, he should not be -removedfor this reason.The Cabinet agreed   . [^-ShA^^r^To leave the question in the hands ofthe Lord Chancellor, who was asked to.take into account the views oftfhxscolleagues as to the political diffi-culties which were likely to arise&apos;from the removal of Magistrates onthe ground of passive resistance., ,
