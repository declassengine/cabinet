4. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum, by theLord Privy Seal in regard to the. following parliamentary question standing in the name of Mr Onnsby-Gores-&quot;To ash the Prime Minister whether his attention has been called to a recordeddecision of Mr Bonar Law&apos;s Cabinet that ministers of the Crown, while holdingoffices should refrain from writingarticles for publication in. the Press;and whether he will adopt this practice in the case of the present Government&quot;.The Cabinet agreed  That in regard to the second part ofthe Question the Lord Privy Seal should reply to the effect that it was impos-sible to draw such a fine distinctionbetween spoken and written statements by Ministers as was implied in theQuestion? but that? whether speakingor writing publicly? Ministers of theCrown must use their discretion as to.what they say.
LOANS TOHERRING-fisheries in SOOEkANDFOR THEPURCHASE;PP NETS-5*    The Secretary for Scotland drew the attentionof the cabinet as a matter of urgency? to the Memorandacirculated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and himself on the subject of loans to herring fishermenin Scotland for the purchase of nets (Papers CoP.-250(24) and Co P.-262 (24)).The Cabinet agreed  To discuss the question at their next Meet in g0
out MEETINGOF CABINET.6.    The Cabinet agreed  That the next Meeting should he held on THURSDAY, MAY 1st, 1924,at 3.1 a. 10*2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W,1,April 29, 1924.
It will be within the recollection of the ConaiaVoteethat at the recent Imperial Economic Conference the thenGovernment subiuitted certain proposals on this matter andthat as a result of the discussions of the Conferencethese proposals were subsequently added to.    A pledge wasgiven to the Dominions and Colonies to submit these pro*-posals to Parliament, a pledge which, in the words of thePrime Minister, we intend to fulfil &quot;to the last letter and to the fullest extent&quot;.    Subsequently there was anappeal to the electorate   an appeal on grounds chosennot by us but by the late Government   and during theGeneral Election these proposals for increasing and adding to the existing Preferences were brought prominently tothe notice of the electors.    The result of the appeal iswell known and quite obviously it cannot be ignored.But apart from that, we on this side of the House,though not for a single moment admitting that we are onewhit behind those on the other side in our determination to do all in our power to promote the best interests of theEmpire, have never believed that those interests will inthe long run be well served by a system of Tariff Preference,and this view we have expressed by our votes in this house on many occasions.In these circumstances the Government are unable to endorse the proposals of their predecessors.   We greatlyregret any disappointment that -this nay cause the Dominionsand Colonies , but for that disappointment not. this government but our predecessors are responsible.There is one of these proposals to which I should liketo make specific reference.    The late Government stated thatthey were ready to guarantee that if the sugar duty were reduced, the preference should for a period of. ten years not fall with It but he maintained at its present rate of nearly-1-
v&apos;id. per lb. so long at least as the duty on foreign sugardid not fall below that level.    This proposal followed a previous undertaking given by Mr Churchill on behalf of the then -Government in 1922 that for a pexlod of ten yearspreference would be continued on the articles then entitled-to it.No Government in our opinion should attempt to bindParliament or future Governments for a period of years in a controversial matter such as tariff preference.    The only result must be to raise hopes which are bound sooner or later to be frustrated.    I think it important therefore to make our position quite clear.   V.re do not propose to endorse orto offer any kind of guarantee in this connection over aperiod of years.    All we can say is that so long as we remainin office we do not propose, in all the circumstances, to ask parliament to abolish the preferences now accorded, which, wesuggest?  should ro;. .&apos;.in on their existing statutory basis.But we wish it to be clearly understood that we reserve fullliberty to propose to Parliament, whenever we deem it expedi-ent from the point of view of general and financial policy,the reduction or abolition of duties on the commodities towhich the existing preferences apply.It will be clear from what I have just said that wecannot take the responsibility of putting down Ways and MeansResolutions covering those proposals of the late Governmentwhich involve the imposition of new or increased taxation.But if the matter we re to ds lo ft in that position it would follow that so far as the Budget debates are concerneddetailed discussion would of necessity be confined to thoseof the proposals which involve the reduction of taxationupon Empire products.
The Government therefore intends to allot a day, &quot;beforethe Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, for a discussion ofthe Preference proposals of the late Govemrment at the :.Imperial Economic Conference;    we shall place upon thePaper a lie solution or Resolutions in a declaratory formdealing: with those proposals in order to give an opportunityto the House of full discussion apart altogether from theBudget debates and of a free and unfettered decision.Should the House decide in favour of any of the proposals the Government will of course &quot;take the necessary steps to incorporate them in the Finance Bill.
LAND, VALUATION AID LAND TAXATION,Members on this side of the House will expect me to say something on a subject in which they are keenly interested,that of land valuation and land taxation.    Speaking&apos; on thissubject a year ago I said, on behalf of the Labour Party,that when we occupied the Treasury Bench we should deal withthis question.   We intend to do so.    I am quite sure that myfriends will not expect that we can be prepared after a fewweeks of office to submit in this Budget a full and compre-hensive scheme for land valuation and land taxation.    Itwould be undesirable to submit to Parliament ill-considered and hasty legislation on a difficult and complicated subjectlike this.    We want our proposals to be thorough, practical and as simple as possible.   We have already begun the necessaryenquiries and preparations which will be carried throughwithout delay.In the meantime there are certain things which can and .should be done. The work of the Land Valuation Office, sincethe demise of the land Values Duties introduced by the Right   &apos;Hon. Member for Carnarvon, has fallen into three parts:    first,there is the important and productive task of valuing landfor &quot;purposes of Estate Duty:    secondly, the office has acted in valuations aixrl in negotiations for purchase or sale forGovernment purposes generally:    thirdly, it has acted sirai-larly for local authorities where Exchequer funds are involved.In the performance of these varied duties it.had until lastyear the assistance of the information contained in the particulars rendered by transferors and lessors on the occa-sions of sales or long let tings of land.    These particulars&apos;
did not merely provide information as to the oliangLiigownership and boundaries of land:   they constituted a mineof information as to the changing value of land and greatly facilitated the work performed &quot;by a Department highlyefficient in itself.    The circumstances in which it wasdecided last year to repeal the requirement of those parti-circulars will be fresh in the minds of Hon. Members..    We dissent from that decision and we shall submit proposals under whichthis information wou.ld again become available.    In the viewof the Government the Land Valuation Offioe should, be astrong, office and the Government Valuer, who in dealing with matters of public finance lias to operate over a wide area andto know it through and through, should not be deprived of a source of practical information which greatly facilitateshis work and which if taken away can be replaced from other,sources only with unnecessary delay ana difficulty.    these considerations would be weighty at any time:   they have addedweight at the present day when the value of land is shiftingand difficult to gauge.The necessary legislation I regret to say will notappear in the Finance Bill.    I am advised that the proposal would be out or order for inclusion in the Finance Bill ofthe year, but we hope to introduce a separate short Bill todeal with the matter.There is a further matter to which I should allude.Owing to the repeal of the Land Values Duties, recruitment inthe Land Valuation Office has been suspended for some years.Enquiry is now being made as to the sufficiency of the numbeisof the existing staff for the present duties of the officeand for additional work which may be Imposed upon it.   I havehad in this connection t    review an intention which, as Iunderstand, was formed by the&apos; late Government to establish
a Central Valuation Department by amalgamating the LandValuation Office and certain snail staffs engaged in valua-tion and purchase and sale in other Departments;    theorganisation of the Central Valutaion Office being thus .removed from the jurisdiction of the Board of InlandRevenue.    I have been unable to concur in the principle underlying that proposal.    Quite apart from the consideration-tion that the chief part of the work of the office is work with ultimately a Revenue object, I am bound to take intoaccount&apos;our intention that the Land Valuation Office should become concerned in a new valuation of land for purposes ofnew taxation, and it is therefore desirable that the office should remain under the Inland Revenue Board.

Telegram from Secretar:/ of State to Viceroy, Departmentof Commerce,  dated April, 1924,-&apos;Your telegram dated. .28th March.      Steel.     You will realise that His Majesty!s Government does not hold theview that a policy of fiscal protection is that best calculated to promote the economic and industrial interestsof any country..     But Nis Majesty&apos;s Government has no intention of departing from the spirit of the fiscal autonomy Convention, which has been built up by pronounce-merits of successive Governments since 1919;    and it accepts the position that (except possibly on specific groundsIrrelevant to the present question)  it will not disallow anytariff measure which the Government of India, after prior   *official consultation with the Secretary of State, recommendsto the legislature and which the legislature accepts.Moreover,  I should add that any measures of preference In favourof British goods  In the Dominions have hitherto always come inthe form of entirely spontaneous offers from such Dominions;and His Majesty&apos;s Government attach importance to this principlebeing adhered to with regard to India.2-     As I have not had before me the materials for checlingdetailed figures of cost on production, price of imported goods, etc, on which they have based their calculations of duties and bounties appropriate to various classes of goods,I cannot express definite opinion on these, but must leave itto your Government to ocrutini.se these figures carefully andmodify the duties or bounties in any cases in which you cannot accept figures on which they are based.3.    In paragraph 4 of your telegram you remark that procedure adopted by Tariff Board has Involved writing down capital ofTata Iron and Steel Company for purpose of arriving at reasonable cost of producing, steel in India,      I agree with you that as value of works Is less than capital expenditureaccount writing down is necessary.      But further,  sincenominal capital account as exhibited In paragraph 78 exceeds15 crores adopted for estimating return on Investment,  It wouldappear that, apart from unforeseen developments, holders of ordinary and deferred shares will not receive normal dividendsif nominal capitalisation is left as at present.      This willprovide a lever for Company in future years to press for protection to bo maintained at a rate sufficient to producenormal dividends on the admittedly inflated capital.      I thinkit very desirable therefore to bring all possible pressure tobear on Tata;s to promise early reconstruction on basis of lower capital value,.      This would have further advantage ofsecuring admission by Tata5 s that Tariff Board&apos;s calculationsare correct in substance and that they are in fact overcapitalised.      It might be put to Tata?s that whole object of scheme which is to develop steel industry will be greatlyfurthered by such reconstruction as this, which will help themto raise new capital when needed in future.
4.      Proposal of Tariff Board that your Government shouldtake power to impose offsetting duties is, as you recognise,open to serious constitutional objection.     You will have recognised, from what I have said above that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would not desire that you should Incur anyembarrassment whatever for the sake of establishingprinciple of Imperial preference if there ia not the voluntary disposition in your Government to grant it.I cannot conceal my strong doubt of prospects of success ofthe methods by which you suggest that this object might ineffect be attained.5.      If you find It necessary in last resort to acceptproposal to take this power,  I shall be prepared to acquiesce, but it Is in my opinion clear that absolutelyunfettered power over tariff rates should not pas3 toExecutive Government and permissible increase should,  Ithink, be limited to 25 per cent, of rate imposed byLegislature.6.      I note your assurance that this power would be exercisedonly in case of necessity when you are satisfied of realityand urgency of need, that save in most exceptional cases it would only be exercised after public and careful investigation usually by Tariff Board,  and, finally, that whereverfeasible you would consult Legislature before taking action.I attach utmost importance to these points.     I also thinkthat in legislation contemplated your Government should, take power to require manufacturers to give relevant information regarding their business and to produce books if called for.7.      I accept proposals in paragraph 12 of your telegramregarding three-year period.8.     I agree with you in wishing to have report publishedbefore end of months9.      I await views of Railway Board promised in paragraph 3of your telegram, on Tariff Board&apos;s estimate of cost of higher duties on railways.
