The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Tome Secretary and the Secretary of State forthe Colonies in regard to the new reference to theJudicial Committee of the Privy Council, in which theashed that the Governments legal representativesbefore the Judicial Committee should urge that decisions by a majority should be valid, and, further that in the despatch informing the Irish Free Statethat this question is being laid before the JudicialCommittee, it should be stated that, while It wouldbe premature to anticipate what the finding of theCommittee on this point will be, it would, in theopinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government, be incompatible with the honourable observance of uhe intentions ofthe Treaty to allow the proceedings of the Commissionto be brought to nullity by x-eason of such a finding(Paper O.P.-403 (24&apos;)).
After hearing the Attorney-General and the lord advocate, who pointed out the legal difficulties in theway of interpreting Article 12 of the Treaty as enabling amajority to prevail, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That while Counsel for the Governmentin opening the case before the Committeeof the Privy Council should adopt ingeneral a non-contentious attitude, theyshould be instructed to state, withspecial reference to the additionalquestion now to be added, that in the -viewof the Government the Treaty as confirmed by Parliament was intended to be an effective instrument and that the Governmentwould view with great regret advice tendered to His Majesty which would in any way tendto prevent the Treaty from achievinp; thepurpose for which it was designed.(b) That, in the despatch informing the IrishFree State that this question is being laid before the Judicial Committee of&quot;the privy Council, the Secretary of State forthe Colonies should be authorised to makeit clear that the question had been put atthe request of the Gbaimiian-Designate, butthat His Majesty&apos;s Government take theview that the intention of the Treaty wasthat decisions by a majority should bevalid, and that the Government&apos;s legalrepresentatives would be instructed &quot;to impress upon the Judicial Committee the considerations in favour of this view andthe importance of its prevailing.    TheSecretary of State should, however, avoid any suggestion at this st-&apos;*ge that theBritish&quot;Government contemplated legislation in the event of an adverse decision by theJudicial Committee of the Privy Council.The form of the communication to the IrishFree State, whether by official despatch orconfidential letter to the President ofthe Executive Council, was left to theSecretary of State.
LIQUOR CONTROL. 2. The attention of the Cabinet was called tothe following Question for the Prime Minister in(previous reference: the House of Commons* which had been postponed untilCabinet 25(2l)3 Oon- Monday, July 21st:-- elusion 3o j*Mr TURNER:    To ash the Prime minister if a in view of the statement of the&quot;Lord Chancellor that the drink qu.es-tion is a question too urgent to beleft alone ? the Government is preparedto take action regarding&quot;the same,and? if so, whether by legislation or by inquiry&apos;1.The Cabinet were informed that the statement&apos; - by the Lord Chancellor, quoted in the Question, hadnot doen in the nature of an ex cathedra pronouncemenbut was merely an interpolation in some remarks inregard to a proposal that the Bishop of Oxford&apos;s Billif it passed a Second Reading, should be referred to select Committee of the House of Lords.    It was onlyin that context that the Lord chancellors observatioshould be construed.    CAn extract from the LordChancellor&apos;s speech is attached/fen Appendix       )AThe Cabinet agreed  That the Prime Minister should reply toMr Turner1s Question to the effect thatit was impossible for the Government totake action regarding the drink agues-tion so late in the Parliamentary Session,at a time when the pressure of business was so great, but that during the AutumnSittings the Government would considerthe whole matter and would be preparedto make a definite statement. .&apos;.2 3 Whit ehal 1 Gardens , S. \/. 1,July IS, 1924.
9Q Q&amp;t J1 oAPPEND I E.&quot;You cannot, by mere abstract legislation from somecentralised body like Parliament, deal with the liquorquestion efficiently, nor would it do to leave it alone,for it is a question too urgent to be left alone.But there is a third way, and that is to lay down theprinciple that the authority of the State should beapplied in conjunction with local opinion;    in other words, you apply to this problem the principle which you have applied to other questions &apos;  the method of devolution.    That mode of dealing with the matter was put into operation in the Carlisle system, and thegeneral testimony has been that the experiment succeed-ed arid that it was an experiment well worth considering.What I understand the right rev. Prelate to ash is that your Lordships should appoint a Select Committee toconsider the principle, to consider the way in which itmay be applied in this Bill? and, if necessary, to   &apos;amend the Bill   in short, to deal with the whole subject in such a fashion that the principle comes tothe front and that the details are dealt with as, of necessity, subordinate.  ...... 11(Parliamentary Debates, House of Lords,Vol.  57.Nb.&apos;49,&apos; Column 1073.)-
