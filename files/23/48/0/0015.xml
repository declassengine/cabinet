SUGAR BEST.9.    The Cabinet had before them the Report of an(Previous .Reference:Cabinet 36(24), Con-oiusion 4.)Inter-Departmental Committee on a Proposed Subsidy(Paper 0. P.-382 (24))for Sugar Beet/, the Conclusions of which are summarised at the end of the Report in the following terms:-(a) We are satisfied that the industry will not continue or develop withoutfurther heIn,(b)We think that assistance at the rateof 19s. 6d. per ewto of sugar isnecessary at the outset, but thatif this is given the industry canto pay excise duty.afford(o)We consider that assistance is neces-sary for ten years, but that afterthe first four years the subsidy couldbe reduced to 13/-S. per cwt., and -after a further three years to 6s.6d.per cwt.(d) We recommend that the assistancesug-gested above should be given by meansof a direct subsidy per &quot;cwt,, of&apos; sugarproduced, coupled with a condition that the factory should pay the growersof beet a miniiiiuixi price of 44/-S. perton of beet during the first four years,with an additional amount for a threeyears contract.(e) We believe that these proposals will secure the immediate establishment ofat least six new factories, which willprovide additional employment for 2,400more men on the land, for 3,600 men inthe factories in the winter months,and for the considerable number requiredfor the erection of the factories andthe provision of the necessary machinery.(f) The net cost of these proposals in thecurrent financial year will probably not exceed  180,000, which might riseto  300,000 in 1925-26 anu  500,000 in1926-27 if six new factories are putin hand at once.

WIRELESS SERVICES.Memormdram &quot;by the Postmaster-General.fl)   The Marconi Company have now accepted, withoutreservation, the deoision of the Government that the ownership and operation of all stations in this country for communicationwith the Empire (including Canada) must be in Government hands,and state that they will co-operate with the Government in theoperation of the services in the Dominions.(2)   They have also agroed to proseed immediately to erectshort wave directive stations (commonly know/h as &quot;beam stations&quot;)in 6anada, and in accordance with the Cabinet deoisions I amarranging with them for the erection of a correspondingstation in this1 Couhtry, capable of extension later to providebeam communication with South Africa, India and Australia, if those countries or any of them should wish to adopt this measisof communication.(3)   It is proposed that the beam station in this country should he erected by the Company at oost price, plus &amp;foestablishment charges and 10$ profit, subject to a maximum,excluding the site, of  51,658 for the Canadian station, If apublic electrical supply is available, or  57,938 if a publicsupply is not available.     The maximum cost of each additionalunit (i.e* the enlargement required for providing communicationwith one other Dominion) will be  33,472 or  36,117 according as a public supply is or is not available.     The Company toreceive a royalty of &amp;%fo on the gross income accruing to thestation
station so long as valid Marconi patients are used in it.     TheCompany guarantee a speed of 100 words per minute each way for the following average hours daily throughout the year,namely:- Canada, 18,    South Africa 11,    India 1 ,    Australia 7;and the stations are not to be accepted and paid for unless   this guarantee is fulfilled.      The Company guarantee completionwithin six months from the date on which the site Is placed attheir disposal.      I regard these terms as reasonable *(4)   An agreement to give effect to these arrangements hasbeen drafted and will be executed as soon as possible.     Underthe Standing Orders it will have to be approved by resolution of the House of Commons.(5)   But beam stations will be useful as an auxiliary onlyto super stations and will not be a substitute for them,,Super stations rill still be necessary for long distancecommunication at all hours and simultaneous transmission in alldirections and in particular for strategic purposes.      Thecompletion of the Rugby Station (as a sixteen mast station)will accordingly be pressed on with all speed.(6) As regards the provision of higher masts at theexisting station at leafield, however (which was another ofthe Donald Committee^ recoramendations), the Air Ministry have raised strong objestions, which cannot be ignored.    But theleafield Station as it already exists will be useful fortelegraphic braoacasting and for communication with non-Marconistations in Canada and elsewhere.(7)   The Dominions and India have not yet finally decidedtheir policy.    I understand that the super station in Sor.thAfrica, which the Marconi Company are under contract to erect,will probably be completed.    The Indian Government also willprobably decide to arrange for the ejection of a super station,and
and. the New Zealand Government have informed us that theycontemplate such a station;    hut in the two latter canes no practical steps havo yet been taken.      The commonwealth government are being pressed for an early decision,(8)     The question of Empire Wireless policy having been settled with the Marconi Company so far as tfois Country isconcerned, I propose in accordance with the decision previouslytaken by the Cabinet to negotiate with the Company as regardsa licence for stations in this Country for communication withforeign countries on the basis of the recommendations of theDonald Committee.(9)     The Company have also agreed to confirm a provisionalsettlement, which had been discussed but not finally accepted,of their claims for remuneration for the use of the Company1sstations in this Country during the Far.      The settlement means a payment of  75,000 beyond the sums already paid tc tho Cpmpanyor paid into Court, and the total payment will then representabout one half of that claimed by the Company under the petition of Right, which they presented and which will now be withdrawn.(10)     The Cabinet Committee agree with me that the time has now almost arrived for a public announcement, but as I hopemore definite information may be available from the Dominionsand especially from Australia within the next few days, Ipropose to defer the announcement until the middle of thepresent month.
