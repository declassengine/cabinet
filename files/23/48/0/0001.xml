One featuredeserves special emphasis. &quot;---It
It is explicitly stated in the reportthat it is an indivisible whole, andthe signatories in terms renounceall responsibility if certain oftheir recommendations are adopted,,and others rejected.While therefore in some respects the proposals may be capable Of improve-merit, His Majesty1s Government attachso much importance to agreed recommenda-tions which can be brought into immediateoperation, that they for their partwill be prepared to support the scheme in its entirety, provided that allthe other parties concerned are willingto take the same course, agreeing togive the experiment a real chance andwaiting to make any modifications which may appear necessary after ex-perience and by common agreement.
