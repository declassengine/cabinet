THE POLICE.Re Instate-ment of Hendismissedin oonneo-tion withthe strike of 1919.(previous reference:Cabinet 51(24), Con-elusion 3.)llo    The Home Secretary gave his colleagues an account of the meeting which had taken place betweenthe Prime Minister, the Lord Privy Seal and himself with part of the Executive of the parliamentary labour Party on the previous evening on the questionof the reinstatement of the Policemen dismissed in1919.    In the course of a discussion lasting for an hour and a half, the difficulties of reinstatsmentof the Police had been fully explained to the repre-sentafives of the Parliamentary Labour Party Executive,and a discussion had taken place as to the possibilityof some other form of amelioration of the positionof the men who had been dismissed, Including theremoval of the bar to re-employment, a return ofrateable reductions in pension, etc.    The Executive ofthe Parliamentary Labour Party had then undertaken topresent their views of the conversation in writing.  .Later in the evening it was learned that a member ofthe Labour Party Executive had consulted the executive of the Police. Union, who had insisted on completereinstatement.    Mr Henderson then read a note from MrJ.H. Hayes, M.P., insisting, at the outset, on completereinstatement, but modifying this somewhat in detail by suggesting that the men could be absorbed as andwhen vacancies arose, that serving; men should not bedisplaced or penalised in seniority, and that nothing in the Police Act served as a bar to this policy.    the document concluded by recalling that the Labour party was pledged to the policy of reinstatement.    Mr Hendersonalso read a letter from Mr lansbury, urging that thedismissed men should be re-employed.    The Homa^Sacj^etaay5&apos;
then read extracts from a Eome Office Memorandum onthe subject; pointing out that complete reinstatementwas impossible, explaining that legislation was required for most of the proposed methods of ameliorative-tion9 except in the case of the removal of the barto the re-enlistmenb of dismissed men.    This latterstep could be taken by the Hone Secretary, but only after taking the advice of the Police Council.   More-over, the Government would have to give an instruction to the Coinroissloners of Police, Watch Coumittees, andPrison Services.    The Home Office were pledgee to theWatch Committees to support the policy of dismissaladopted in 1919, and some of the Watch Committees were known to be unwilling to re-enlist the dismissed men.Other difficulties were indicated.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That it would be an advantage if thediscussions on the earlier Clauses ofthe Home Office Vote (Inspection of factories and Workshops , etc.) couldbe prolonged so as to give time forfurther discussion of the questionof the dismissed. Police with theParliamentary Labour Party:(b) That if, as seemed probable, thequestion whs raised in debate, theHome Secretary should be authorised tostate that there were insuperable diffl-culties to the reinstatement of thedismissed Policemen, and to state inas sympathetic terms as possible thatthe Government were looking into other questions, such as the possibility of re-employment, the return of rateablereductions in pensions, and any possible measures to ameliorate the position of.  &quot;     the s e men-.&quot;He should; be authorised, if he considered itnecessary,, to offer a Committee of Inquiry&quot;
&apos;    10612.  The Cabinet had under consideration theReport of a Committee presided over by the Right Hon.George N. Barnes, on the Claims of Professional ex-Ranker Officers (0ml,2124).The Cabinet were informed that the PrimeMinister had undertaken to receive a Deputation onthe subject headed by Dr. Macnajiiara.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To take note of, and approve, the- Report of the Co limit tee (Cmd. 2124) s(b) That the Minister of Labour shouldbe responsible for giving effect tothe r3oojurnondation in Paragraph 31of the Report: -11 That Hi s Ma j e si y - s Gove government ntshould make renewed appeal to employers of labour to give themost sympathetic considerationto the claims of all these ex-officers for suitable employment&quot;:(c) That the Secretary of State for war should give effect to the recommenda-tion in Paragraph 32 of the Report:-&quot;That soldiers who, having alreadycompleted a 12 years engagementas soldiers, were discharged duringthe war on being granted a temporarycommission without sufficient service in the ranks to qualify for asoldier5 s pension, and had not,on being demobilized, sufficientcombined service to qualify for asoldier5s pension, should be allowedto submit their claims to the WarOffice with a view to their beingawarded a - soldier1s pension from&quot;the date of their ceasing to drawpay as officers, on so much of theircombined service as will not exceeda tote,l of 18 years services notwith-standing that it falls short of theminimum period normally necessaryfor pension3 viz., 21 years&quot;2(d) That the Secretary of State for war should have authority to announce the above decisions in Parliament:(e) That the Secretary to the Cabinet should write a letter to Mr Barnes and theother members of the Committees convey-ing to them a cordial expression of thethanks of the Cabinet for their work
