The Cabinet agreed  That, with a view to a discussion ofthis question immediately after theWhitsuntide Recess, the Presidentof the Board of Trade should cir-ou-late a Memorandum in regard to thenature of the proposed inquiry, theTerms of Reference, and composition.-1-
DEVOLUTION. 2. After consideration of two Memoranda by theLord Privy Seal, proposing the appointment of a Royal(previous reference: Commission to consider the question of Devolution,Cabinet 35(24) , Con-        as veil as suggesting Terms of Reference (Paper CP. -elusion 7.)324 (24) and Paper CP.-329 (24)), the Cabinet agreed(a) That, in view of the attitude of theConservative Party towards select committees to investigate the PoorLaw, ex-Ranker Officers, etc, itwas useless to propose a SelectCommittee on&apos; Devolution.    On theother hand, it was felt that theappointment of a Royal commission was open to objection:(b) That the Prime Minister&quot;should, assoon as possible, see the Deputationsof the Labour and Liberal scottish home Rule groups,   preferably together;should explain to them the difficulties,with which the Government were con-fronted as to the kind of Inquiry toset up;   and should invite them toapply their minds to the matter andto make suggestions;    he should intimate at the same time that theGovernment had the suggestion of an inquiry under careful consideration.
3.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Labour, covering the draft Hours ofIndustrial Employment Bill (Paper CP.-304 (24)),together with Memoranda, by the First Lord of theAdmiralty (Paper CP.-327 (24)), the Minister of -Labour (Paper CP. -334 (24)) and the Secretary ofState for Air (Paper CP.-335 (24)).Two separate classes of objection were raised in these Papers against the Bill, namely, first, the objection of the Service Departments to certain pro-visions of the Bill; and, second, the objection of therailway and certain dock interests.After considerable discussion the cabinet agreed  (a) (By a majority) That the Minister ofLabour should&quot; have authority to intro-duoe the Hours of Industrial employment bill (subject to (b)):(b) That the Minister of Labour shouldsummon a meeting of representativesof all the Departments concerned, toconsider the working of the Bill Inits application to Government Departments.
SUGAR BEIT.&apos; (previous reference:Cabinet, 18(23), Con-clusion 1(a)(iv).)4. After consideration of Memoranda by theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries and by theChancellor of the Exchequer, on the subject of a proposed subsidy for sugar beet (Papers 0cPo-325 (24)and C.P*-330 (24)), the Cabinet agreed  That the question should be referred for consideration and report toThe Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Minister of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries,The Secretary for &quot;Scotland,or representatives of theirrespective Departments.
SCOTLAND.&apos; Resumptionon Purchaseof SnailHoldings.5. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary for Scotland, covering a draft Bill in regardto the resumption on purchase of small holdings inScot laid (Paper CP.-316 (24)).The Cabinet were informed that under the pro-visions of the Small Landholders (Scotland) Actsan owner who desired personally to occupy a holdingcould avail himself of this right if he was able toshow that he possessed no landed estate other thanthe holding he proposed to resume.    In recent years there had been cases where, owing to the breaking upof estates, small holdings had been sold as separateitems at prices beyond the reach of the occupiers,and the purchasers thus becoming owners of a singleholding5which was their only landed estate, had pro-ceeded to exercise their right of resumption for personal occupation, with the result that the occupiershad been evicted.    The object of the Bill was to preventinjustice to small holders who had often expendedcapital and built homes on their holdings.The Cabinet agreed  To approve the principle of the bill and to refer it for examination indetail by the Committee of HomeAf fairs.ft

IRELAND.,.: Boundaries(J of Ulster.IrishBoundaryCorxarrlsslbn.(previous reference:Cabinet 33(24), Con-conclusion 9. )7. The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary of State for the Colonies , covering a Despatchwhich he had addressed to the Governor-General of theIrish Free State regarding the reference to theJudicial Committee of the Privy Council of certain questions relating to the Irish Boundary Commission(Paper CP.-323 (24)).The Prime minister gave his colleagues a full account of his interview with Mr Cos grave, the Presidentof the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, andSir James Craig, the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland,on Saturday, May 31st, at Chequers.    From this Confer-ence an important difference of opinion had emergedin regard to the powers of the Commission to be set up under Article 12 of the Irish Treaty.    No provisionhad been made in the Treaty as to whether the decisionof the Commission was to be valid by a majority or onlyin the event of unanimity.    The Prime Minister ofNorthern Ireland considered that unanimity was intendedand gave precedents in favour of that interpretation.The President of the Executive Council of the Irish FreeState took the opposite view, that a majority decision was sufficient.    If the former view prevailed. Sir james craig would probably be willing to appoint a representa-tive to the Commission.    In that event, howevoVi^M^^^Cos grave would probably ^^^o^xJ^^^^^ii^pfjiaT1&apos;The suggestion was made that the best plan wouldbe to refer this point to the Judicial Committee,of the privy Council.The Prime Minister informed his colleagues thatthe OniQg Justice/of South Africa had &quot;intimated his willingness to accept the Chairmanship of the Commission.-7-
The Cabinet agreed  (a) To take note of Despatch No.314, ofthe 23rd Mag, from the Secretary ofState for the Colonies to the Soverror-General of the Irish Free State,attached to Paper CP.-328 (24), con-taining the terms of reference to theJudicial Committee of the Privy Council(b) That the Chief Justice of South Africa(who was willing to accept the post of chairman of the Commission) should he invited to come to England at once,and should then be asked to proceed toIreland in order to see the PrimeMinister of Northern Ireland and thePresident of the Executive Councilof the Irish Free State and to makea preliminary and persona. 1 explorationof the question at issue pending;the appointment of the Commission.-8-
THE blind persons ACT,1920.(previous reference:Cabinet 34(24) , Con-clusion 4.)8. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to aQuestion to be asked in the House of Commons the same day as to whether the Government is prepared to facili-tate the Blind Persons Act (1920) Amending Bill by introducing the necessary financial resolution.The Cabinet were reminded that the parliamentary secretary of the Ministry of Health, with the authorityof the Lord Privy Seal, had announced in the House ofCommons, on Second Reading, that the Government wouldgive very sympathetic consideration to the future ofthe Bill.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the reply should be to the effectthat the Government were consideringthe Bill in relation to Its contents,and the procedure In regard to It inrelation to the Rules of the House,and that if the Question were repeatedafter Vvliitsuntide a reply would bexxv en:(b)   That, in the meantime, the Chancellorof the Exchequer should examine thequestion.
9,    The Prime Minister handed to the Chancellorof the Exchequer a file of correspondence in regard toForestry, with a request that it should be dealt withby the Cabinet Committee on Unemployment Policy.The Lord President of the Council stated thathe had been going into the question of afforestation,from the point of -view of the experimental side, underthe Committee of Industrial and Scientific Research.He undertook to communicate the results of hisinquiries to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with aview to their co-ordination with the work of theCabinet Committee on Unemployment Policy.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn, as amatter of urgency, to the following motion to be raised in the House of Commons the same evening in regard toforestry:-&quot;To call attention to the question ofAfforestation;    and to move, That this house urges upon the Government thedesirability of extending the opera-tions of the Forestry Commission and,generally, of promoting the interestof Afforestation, as a means of in-creasing the capital assets of theCountry,&quot; providing employment in a healthy and remunerative occupation, and,particularly in the Highland and. certain other Scottish counties, facilitating the settlement of smallholders on aneconomic basis. 11The Cabinet agreed  That the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries should have authority to state in the Debate in the-House of commons that a Cabinet Committee was consideringthe subject of Afforestatioxi among other questions, and was collecting ii^.terialson the subject.   Mr Buxton should further -point out that the type of declarationcontained in the resolution was easy tomake bu.t not so easy to implement.Without reflecting in any way on the forestry Commission, he should statethat the Government were not satisfiedthat a good scheme of Af fore sta.fi oncould be worked out on the basis of the
existing GoiM-sis sion.    In thisconnection he should insist onthe iiiiportance of linking upAfforestation with Land Settlement,as indicated by the Prime minister in his speech on Unemployment onLay 29th;    and should indicate thatif the House wished to pass theresolution the Government wouldnot oppose it, but that it mustbe interpreted In a very generalway, ana subject to the foregoingremarks.
