The Prime Minister, as Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, made to his colleagues a statement in re genii to various aspects of Foreign Policy.EGYPT. The Prime Minister Informed the Cabinet that(Previous after the recent Debate in the House of Lords, ZaghlulReference:Cabinet 38        Pasha, the Egyptian President of the Council   had(24), Con- ^elusion lo.)       offered his resignation to the King of Egypt, butthat it had since been withdrawn.   As a result of thestatement he himself had made in the House of commons on Monday, June 30th, the doors appeared to have beenreopened, and, though he was not prepared to statedefinitely that Zaghlul Pasha would come to England,at the moment there appeared to be a good chance ofthis happening.
9 iREPARATION.(previous reference:Cabinet 38(24), Con-elusion 1. )Conversationwith Pre nob.President ofthe Council.2,    The Prime Minister informed trie Cabinet thatthere was little to add to what had already appeared in the Press in regard to his interview with M. Herriot.No importance must be attached to the statements inthe Press about &quot;secret diplomacy&quot;.    The procedure withM. Herriot had been exactly the same as at the oonver-sation with M. Theunis and M, Hymans, which had been generally accepted.as appropriate.    He had now receivedthe. French Interpreter&apos; s. report of the conversation,and this would be circulated in the course of the next day or two.    He ashed his colleagues to bear in mind,when they read it, that his own remarks had first beentranslated into and reproduced in French and then re-translated into English, so that the wordinp; might seemunusual.
3. The Prime minister reported that M. Rerriot had agreed that the Conference should take place in London.The following nations had been invited to send repre-sentatlvcs:-   Belgium, France, Italy, Japan, Greece,Portugal, Jugo-Slavia and Roumania, the last fourbeing represented by their Ministers, and all had accepted.   He himself had been in favour of a largerConference, but both the British and French ForeignOffices had objected, on the ground that, if outsidePowers who were not directly interested in Reparationwere broupht in, it would open the door to log-rolling,etc.As regards the representation of the UnitedStates of America, he had notified the Amerioan Govern-ment that the Conference was to be held and that theirrepresentation would bo welcomed in any form which theypreferred.    He had, however, pressed that if they wererepresenteu it might be by someone with authority.In reply he had received a very cordial message fromthe Secretary of State (Mr Hughes), who had nominatedthe American Ambassador (Mr Kellog) and Colonel Logan(who had worked at the Reparation ComiaiSsion) to repre-sent, the United States.    He was to discuss the exactstatus of the Ambassador with Mr Hughes during thelatter&apos;s visit next week.He himself would take the Chair at the PlenaryMeetings of the Conference.   The British representatives,besides himself, would bo Mr Snowden and one other.
REPARATION. 4c The Prime Minister said that he had sent aThe*Forthoom-   message to the Dominions inviting them to send reere-ihp Confer- ^ .ence. sentatives to meet the British Government a-u a specialr^epresenta-      Oonferenee to he held about a week before the opening&apos;tion of theDominions, of the Reparations Conference.    Canada had repliedby asking for se-parate representation at the Repara-tions Conference, which created a position of some difficulty,   When other Dominions- learned that Canadahad taken this action they might also demand separaterepresentation.    If this should happen, the BritishGovernment would be placed in an embarrassing position.If they asked for a large number of representatives forthe British Empire it would make a very unfavourableimpression on the other nations invited to the Confer-ence.After considerable discussion, the -cabinet agreed  (a) That the Conference with the represen&apos;a-tives of the Dominions should be arranged to take place at the earliest possible moment, and the Prime Minister should explain to the Conference the whole position and the difficulties with whichwe were confronted in regard to repre-sentation:(b) That at this Conference the Prime minister should explain to the representatives ofthe Dominions that the object of the reparations Conference was of a strictly limited scope;   that there was no questionof concluding any new Treaty, but that,as explained&quot;in his telegram of June 28thto the Dominions, the object was to concertthe necessary arrangeiuents for putting the dawes Report into operation;   that therewas no question of changing the percentagepayable to the British Empire of the sumsreceived for reparation (22 per cent.) ,much less of altering the allocaiion ofthe percentage as between the Mother Countryand the Dominions as agreed to at theImperial Conference, 1921;    that therewas no question of incurring any militarycorutiiitment, and that we intended to retainfull liberty of action in the event of a default by Germany, and not to go further
than to agree to consult with our allies, if and when the contingencyarose, as to the sanctions to beapplied;   and that, having explained the circumstances , the Prime minister should do his best to induce theDominions to a, ,ree to some system of representation which would not undulyenlarge the British Delegation:(c) That, in order to prepare the way forthis Conference, the Secretary ofState for the Colonies should send tothe Dominions a comprehensive telegramexplaining the difficulties and makingtentative suggestions for overcomingthem:(d) That the Prime Minister and Chancellorof the Exchequer should represent theBritish Government at the Conference,and that the third place on the Delega-tion should be kept open until&apos; after the consultation with the Dominions.
REPARATION. 5. The Prime Minister informed his colleagues thatThe Forthoom-   the procedure at which he was aiming in regard to theing Conference.  forthcoming Conference was, first, that the AlliesThe Represen- latertat ion of should meet, and, second, that /the German representatives! Germany.should join the Conference.    Before they entered theConference, however, the Px-otocol should he communicatedto the German representatives, who would he invited todiscuss it on terms of complete equality,with a view to obtaining a document which wouldbe signed voluntarily by all who subscribed to it.It would be open to the Germans to secure alterations in the document, which would on no account be presented to them as something which they must accept;
REPARATION. 6. The First Commissioner of Works informed the*ihe Porthcom- Cabinet that a Supplementary Estimate would, he thought,ing Conference.-- be required to enable the Delegates of the variousProposedSupplementary  nations to be entertained at the cost of the Govern-Estimate.ment Hospitality Fund.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That there was no objection to a supplementary Estimate, which wouldgive an opportunity for a discussion in Parliament on the subject of theConference:(b) That the question should be examined in ooncert by the Chancellor of theExchequer and the First commissioner of Works, or their representatives.-7-o
military control INGERMANY.(previous reference:Cabinet 38(24), Con-clusion lo)7. Tlie Cabinet bad before them a memorandum circulated by the Prime Minister in regard to thepresent state of military control in Germany (PaperCo Pe-365 (24)).The Prime Minister informed his colleagues thatM. Herriot had raised this question at the Chequersmeeting, as the result of which a friendly communica-tion had been made to the German Government.    The Germanreply had now been received, and, in his opinion was,in the main, very satisfactory.    The only point towhich he demurred was that the Germans proposed thatthe inspections to establish that Germany had a cleanbill of health in regard to disarmament should becompleted by the end of September.    While in favour of expediting the inspections as much as possible, he wasnot prepared to commit himself to that date.-8-
GUNBOATYANGTSE RIVER 8. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe First Lord of the Admiralty (Paper CP,-351 (24))arid a Memorandum by the Foreign Office (Paper C.P.-363 (24)) in regard to the Yangtse River Gunboats.It was generally agreed that the provision ofgunboats was a necessity, but     strong objection was iie.de against introducing a Supplementary estimate for their immediate provision.The Chancellor of the Exchequer read a Memorandum(See Appendix) which appeared to differ in some respects from the particulars furnished by theForeign Office in CP.-363 (24).The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should re-examine the question from the point of view of urgency, inthe light of the Cabinet discussion and the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;sMemorandum, with a view, If possible,to the avoidance of a supplementary estimate.
9.

In accordancewith this decision the Chancellor of the&apos; exchequer had made an announcement in the following terms inthe Old Age Pensions debate on June 25th, 1924 ;-(Hansard Vol. 175. No, 93. Col. 473).&quot;I am proposing, as hon, Members who have seen the White Paper will understand, tomake an addition of 15/- per week whenderived from sources other than earnings, -10/&apos;- per week which at present may be derived from any source, without reducingthe pension from the full 10/- a week.In the case of a single man I propose toallow 15/-, and. 30/- In the case of a married couple-    In ether words theexisting scale will stand, but I proposothat in&quot;addition a sum of 30/- per week,if it is derived from thrift or benevolence,is to be ignored in calculating the meansof the married couple.    Such a couple,whose income is 50/- a week, will beentitled to a joint pension of  1 a week.In the case of a single person thefigures are halved, and if his or herincome is 25/- a week he or she will beentitled to the full pension of 10/- perweek under like conditions as to the source,of income.

The four ex-Prime ministers who had been Chairmen of the Committee of ImperialDefence had attended at his invitation.    The meeting had been very short.    The Chiefs of Staffs had expressed their views on the subject, and the opinion at themeeting had been unanimously opposed to the constructionof a Tunnel, on the grounds of the difficulty of ensuringits defence In all circumstances and the general upsetto the whole system of National Defence Policy whichwould be involved.    The three Services had been ingeneral agreement that the construction of a TunneIshould be op-posed, for various reasons, including recentand possible developments in methods of warfare.As against the views of the- Service departments the question had been examined from the point of view oftrade.    The President of the Board of Trade had circulated a Memorandum, which showed that there was very littleadvantage to be obtained from the Tunnel from the pointof view of trade, except so far as passengers were concerned.    If, however, passengers were carried tothe extent anticipated by the promoters of the scheme,the. cross-Channel steamer services would cease, and thiswas urgea by the Admiralty as a great disadvantagefrom tli&apos;e...jpolnt of view of naval defence.

Trade also estimated that the Tunnel, if constructed,would not prove a paying propositions    In view ofthese circumstances the Committee of Imperial defence had had no hesitation in recommending the rejection of the scheme.The Cabinet accepted the recommendationof the Committee of Imperial Defence thatat the present time the Channel funnelouoht not to he proceeded with.-tLi C.1

APPENDIX.China Gunboats,___Memorandum hy the Chancellor of the Exchequer,,.It is important to remember thr.it the proposal to build2 gun boats for protection of shipping on the Yang Teze river relatesexclusively to the upper reaches of the Yang Tsze, i^e. above Ichang,Ichang is 165 miles west of Hankow, ^hich is itself 700 milesfrom the mouth of the Yang Tsze0      It is not suggested that forthe 865 miles of the lower Yang Tsze British interests areinadequately protected,,      The Yang Tsze Flotilla consisting of 9gunboats mostly of 645 tons plies on these waters.    Above Ichangthe rapids of the Yang Tsz e are an obstacle to navigation.,It is only to be expected that with China in a-conditionof civil war complete security cannot be guaranteed for. Britishsubjects or others trading some thousand miles from -the coast and beyond, rapids which can only be passed in certain monthsof the year.      It aoes not appear probable that even if 2 additionalgunboats are built and sent up the Yang Tsze, Isolated acts ofbrigandage or sniping from the banks could wholly be suppressed.There must be some limit beyond which if British subjectspenetrate they must do so without complete assurance of lavalprotection.In any case I can see no such condition of urgency as would justify our presenting.a Supplementary Estimate to Parliament.2 gun boats and 2 motor launches are apparently available now for the upper Yang Tsze reaches.       The new boats will takenearly a year and a half to construct, go that they are not likelyto be ready before January 1926 at the earliest, by which time conditions in China may either so improved as to render the
special measures proposed unnecessary, or deteriorated so fares to render them futile,      I do not gather from the despatchesthat airy of our local representatives consider the situationeo menacing that immediate steps must he taken, and in any casethe proposal brings no immediate relieff.The substitution of new vessels for the old ones atpresent employed appears to be eminently a matter for con-sideration in connection with next year&apos;s   Naval Estimates.It is evident from the estimates of cost -  90 ,.000 each - thatthe gunboats the Admiralty propose to send are a much larger typeof warship than those which at present patrol on the Yang Tsse
