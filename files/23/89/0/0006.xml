1&apos;*&quot; The Cabinet had &quot;before them the following memoranda, by the Secretary of State for Poreign affairs on the subject of Anglo-German Relations:.-C.Pe-202 (37),  circulating copies of correspondence with His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Berlin arising out of aremark by General Goring to the Ambassadorabout &quot;the danger of allowing the Germanpeople to continue indefinitely to regardEngland as the enemy in their path&quot;:C*P.-218 (37). circulating copies of a despatch from His Majesty&apos;s ambassador at Berlin describing the latter&apos;simpressions of the National SocialistParty Rally recently held at Nuremberg,and recording conversations he had hadon that occasion with Herr Hitler (relatingto the invitation to Earon von Neurath to visit London, and to the British attitudetowards Nazism);    with General Goring(regarding Germany1s grievances against great Britain, and Germany&apos;s ultimate aims)&quot;?with Dr. Goebbels (on questions  connectedwith the Press of the two countries, andthe general situation);    and with Baronvon Neurath ( relative to the invitation to visit London, Germany&apos;s aims, and theNyon   Conference).The Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs saidthat he had only circulated these Memoranda forinformat ion.The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that hehad seen the Marquess of Londonderry, who had been inGermany as a guest of General Goring, and who reportedthat the General had spoken on his old lines, namely,that it was the British Government that said No to everylegitimate German desire.
SPAIN. 2. The Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs.Le Situation     as an introduction to questions he wished, to raiseIn the Me^iter-K&amp;nean. relating to Spain, gave the Cabinet some account ofjphe Nyon Con-     events since the last Meeting.Jerence and the paris Naval He recalled that at the last. Meeting of the conversations .Cabinet he had still hoped for Italian co-operationPrevious in the Nyon Conference.   Eventually, however, they had reference:Cabinet 34        been unable to attend.   At the Conference we had(37), Con-conclusion 3.)       attained, our objective, which was that the conference should not have an anti-Pas cist tendency, but thetechnical object of dealing with piracy in the Mediter-ranean.    In this we had received full support fromthe French.   M. Delb6&apos;s had. proved, a good. Chairman.Our Delegation was able to co-operate effectively andto keep the Conference within proper limits .He paid a strong tribute to the admirable co-operation of the Naval Staff, and especially to theassistance of the First Sea Lord.   Before the Conferencemet, the technical plans had been agreed, with the french naval Staff, and were ready for presentation. The first sea Lord had been surprised at the extent of the effort-2-
which the French were able to offer,.especially whenathe meagre co-operation offered by m. Laval on/previous occasion   was taken into consideration.    If air co-operation was taken into account the British andFrench effort was about equal.    The first hitch had arisen in respect of the Aegean See..   The first plan had. been that the northern half of the Aegean shouldbe policed by the Russians and Turks, and. the southern half by the Greeks and Yugo-Slavs.    This, however, had proved an unpopular proposal, and as the result ofinformal discussion it had been discovered that thereal difficulty was that the presence of the Russianswas not generally welcomed.    At an informal meetingthere had. been an altercation with the Russians andfor an hour no progress had. been made.   Then .&amp;he*Firot -Sea-Lo-EKJ- had^suggested, that the British andFrench Navies should, take over responsibility for the Aegean, with power to invite Russia and the smallerPowers to assist.   Rather unexpectedly this had beenaccepted, even by the Russians.    In practice this would keep the Russians out of the Aegean, since they would,not be called upon to help.    It also had the effect of keeping the door open for Italy.   He and his colleagues had felt it very desirable to bring Italy into thearrangement.   They had not thought it sufficient merely to give an invitation, but^also to offer her an area.The difficulty was that, if the area had been in somecentral position in the Mediterranean it would, havepending Italy&apos;s acceptance,left a gap/    They had. therefore nit on the idea of&apos; cut^C   fxJ]&apos; o^LoJ!   /W4* v-trrkt^Jit Tj. &apos;lLa $cL&amp;t^c,offering the Tyrhenian Sea, which was large in area^He had. not expected. Italy to accept this proposal athad hopedonce, but/it might provide a basis for a bargain.
This wa,s what had happened, and the Naval Experts in Pariswere discussing the matter at that moment.   He gathered that some difficulties had been encountered on the previous day.    Italy had. asked for charge of one of the entrances to the Mediterranean.   As we held Gibraltar they hadthe Suezwelcome to us, but efforts were being made to find a wayout.   mhe First Sea Lord had the idea that the UnitedKingdom, France and Italy might all operate from port said, Alexandria remaining in our area.The Prime Minister, on behalf of the Cabinet,congratulated the Foreign Secretary on the success ofthe Nyon Conference.(NOTE:   At the outset of the Meeting the sameasked1, with a bs.se at Alexandria.   This was notafternoon the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs informed his colleagues that agreement had been reached by theNaval Advisers at Paris, subject tothe approval of their respective governments .This announcement wasreceived with great satisfaction.)
3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat until recently the Foreign Office had cherished thehope that the victory of one side or the otherwould be purely Spanish.    That view was no longer held.With the duration of the civil war General Franco&apos;sdependence upon Italy had increased.    It was felt thatafter the civil war ended Franco would be unable tocontrol the situation without Italian assistance.   Conse-cliently the Italians were likely to stay for a year, oreven longer.   He did not believe that Signor Mussolini&apos;smotives were purely ideological, or for prestige.   he agreed, with what he understood to be the view of thesought submarineFrench General Staff, that thevEtalians/bases in Spainto be used for bargaining purposes or pressure on otherthereforenations in case of war.    British interests would/best be served by a stalemate leading to a compromise solution,and it would be against British interests that Francoshould win in Spain so long as he was dependent onforeign aid.   Above all, it was against our interests that he should win during the present year.    prolongation of the war for another six months would increase the straion Italy, and if and when Franco should win, Italy wouldbe less able to exploit his success and there would, be slightly better prospects of Franco ridding himself ofthe Italians.    On the other hand, an early victory would create a third Dictator State, this time in Spain, and.this developmenta, making for France a third, frontier tobe defended, would increase.se the likelihood of some earlyadventure elsewhere by the Dictator States.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thenturned to Mr Lloyd mhomas&apos;s despatch from Paris ofSeptember 23rd, which he had asked, his  colleagues tobring to the Meeting.    This explained the point of viewof the French Government, which was very generally held
at Geneva.    Tt brought out% what M* Ch&amp;utemps had. of fronemphasised, that the Spanish question had ceased to be one of politics of the Left or of the ?ight in France, but had become one on which the General Staff view predominateed.     On the night that he himself left Geneva, M.Delbbshad given him a memorandum suggesting very strong repre-sentations to be made to the Italian Government by theEritish and. French Governments.   When he met M. Ohautempshe had -a^ge^ him not^to support this, but in spite of thefact that M. Chautemps was further to the Right in Frenchpolitics than M. Delbos, he had supported it,   He himself had. not liked /the memorandum and had found that the Prime/%Minister took the same viewe   As the result of his conversations with the Prime Minister he had suggested to the French that we should, approach the Italian Govern-ment alone on the basis of the- proposed conversations.Before an answer had arrived, the Italians had themselvesmade a move, and their representative at Geneva had given assurances to the French Foreign Secretary as totheir position in respect of Spain.   At the same time theyhad given similar assurances to our Charge&apos; d*Affairesin Rome.   M. Delbos had replied by suggesting tripartiteconversations between the Governments of the UnitedKingdom, France and. Italy on the subject of the non-intervention policy.   He himself felt that it was the beetplan.The Prime Minister at this  point  reminded theForeign Secretary that at the time of M, Delbos&apos; proposalboth the British and French Governments had received,information to the effect that the Italians were contem-plating the despatch of large reinforcements to Spain.He himself had taken a very serious view of that develop-ment and had. been anxious to stop it.   The proposed conversations bad. been designed to obtain an answer on
this pointo   The Italian representative at Geneva had,however, anticipated this by stating that they were not proposing to send reinforcements o    This had been confirmedto Mr Ingram in Rome by Count Ciano.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreedthat this was an important point.    It must now be realised that unless the non-intervention policy could be ma.de towork better than in the past, it would be impossible forany French Government to keep the Spanish frontier closed.It was highly undesirable, however, that it should bef  1k^i) C+tJLeL lot.   cust-CcUd^,opened,jbeeause then        French nationals would cross it,the Itaiians would reinforce, and soon the French and italians would be fighting one another.    On the otherHe then gave the Cabinet the heads of the proposed anglo-French Note to Italy, which were to the following effect:-The Note would not convey any menace orintention of an ultimatum.    It would not disguise,however, the realities of the internationaldilemma.    It would, begin by welcoming Italiancollaboration in the agreements reached at Nyon,as well as the assurances that no more Italianswould be sent to Spain.    It would  convey the earnest desire of the two Governments that thecivil strife in Spain should cease to be a causeof international unrest, and. that conditions in spain might develop in such a way as to promoteprogress elsewhere towards a general appeasement.The Note would, then say that the governments were convinced that this position could not bereached, until further effort had. been made tomake non-intervention more effective.   So long ashand, if the/policy could, be made to work, the french would, keep ^e^fea^ei-of the frontiersL^^L-,
the volunteers remained, the risk of disturbancewould tend to increase.   Moreover, strongly as thetwo Governments desired to continue non-intervention,from themselvesthey could not conceal/the difficulty of preservingpresent conditions unless steps were taken torender this policy more effective.    Consequentlythey proposed that tripartite conversations shouldtake place.    If agreement were reached, as to thevolunteers it would facilitate the grant of belligerent rights. a-t-the-ear-l-test  poss-i-bl-e-mo-meni-^In addition, he contemplated that His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Rome should speak to the Italian PoreignMinister and explain that His Majesty&apos;s Government were anxious to make progress with the proposed conversations,but could not conceal that the shadow of theSpanish affair rendered this difficult.    The ambassador should appeal to Count Ciano to do his best to agree tothe proposed  conversations.Discussing the prospects of the proposed policy,the Secretary of State said that a good deal depended up on.what was happening between Herr Hitler and Signor Musso-lini in Germany.    If anything had been concluded in thenature of an agreement under which Germany should, have a free hand, in Austria in return for supporting Italy inthe Mediterranean,, it was doubtful if the conversationswould serve any useful purpose.   He doubted, however,whether the Berlin conversations had changed, the situa-tion much beyond making a parade of the Berlin-Rome axis.If this proved correct there was a good, chance for the conversations.Prom the Italian point of view the policy hesuggested offered the advantages that, it would be a realConference of Mediterranean Powers alone, which they had always desired, and. that if agreement  could, be reached on
the withdrawal of the volunteers the question of belligerent-ent rights could also he dealt with.    The proposal there-fore offered something to save the face of the ItalianGovernmento   He thought this proposal offered the best prospect of avoiding the danger that the French frontierwould be thrown open.In the course of the discussion which followed, thesuggestion was made that it would be better to pursue theindividual conversations with Italy before bringing in theFrench.    In support, of this suggestion it was pointed outthat the Italian Government wished the  conversations tocover a great deal of ground.    The proposed tripartiteconversations woul^  cover one point only9 but it was avery important point in Italy&apos;s  case as a whole.     TheItalians were likely to be more forthcoming if they coulddeal with the situation as a whole.   Moreover, the ItalianGovernment was likely to be more forthcoming in conversa-tions with our Government than if France was also repre-sented.    The fact that the invitation came from, two Powerswho ha.d already agreed, on their line would, give the ItalianGovernment the impression iof being in s. minority.    Theymight even ask that Germany should also be invited toattend.      It was true,that this was the kind of conference that we had contemplated for a long time, but in thepresent case Germany and. Italy would, be on one side of the table and. we and France on the other.    That would, not create an easy position.    It was suggested that the closeness of relations between the United Kingdom and France had. perhapsstrengthened, the Berlin-Rome axis.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs did. notthink that the latter was the case.    The effect of ourfirmness at Nyon had. not strengthened the Berlin-Rome axis.-9-
He thought that the Italians had not wanted, to go to berlin with the Mediterranean situation unsettled, andthat had contributed to their co-operating in the Parisconversations.    The Note would be carefully drawn so asto avoid, the impression that the Italians were invited tocome, as it were, into the dock to be judged.   The presentsituation wa.s a very difficult one for the French Govern-raent to hold.     If he had asked them to leave the matter to be handled by His Majesty&apos;s Government the pressure ofFrench public opinion on the Government to open thefrontier might have been so great that they could not have refused.    In reply to a question, he said that if the tripartite talks failed, the opening of the french frontier was, he  eared--, inevitable.    In that event also it would be difficult to make progress with the Anglo-Italian conversations, though it had. to be remembered thatthe Italians desired, these.   He agreed with some of hiscolleagues that it would, be difficult to induce theItalians to bring troops away from General Franco unlessthe Russians did the same.   A scheme, however, had been worked, out by the Non-intervention Committee, and this might form a basis for discussion.The Prime Minister said that he had throughout beenin touch with the Foreign Secretary on this question.His aim had been, if possible, to avoid joint action withthe French, for some of the reasons that had been givenby his colleagues.   He had felt it was dangerous, becausethe Italian attitude towards, the Nyon Conference had beenthat it was a plot to leave the Italians out of controlof the Mediterranean.   He would therefore have preferredfor us to conduct the negotiations alone, and he thoughtthat the Foreign Secretary agreed, with this.   At thesame time it was necessary, in the present Europeansituation, to walk warily so far as our friends were
concerned...   The situation in Prance was parlous and.precarious, and. we could not afford, to put too much strain on the French Government,    It was  clear that unless france had some part in the negotiations with Italy over Spainthe French Government  could not hold, the situation.Somewhat reluctantly, therefore, he ha.d. felt that it-was necessary to assist them in this respect.   Much would depend on the presentation of the Note.   He thought it-was possible to put it in such a form as to extend the talks that had been going on, on a basis of perfectequality.   He thouerht it important, also, simultaneously to start the conversations between the Earl of Perth and.Count Ciano, who appeared to be on very good, terms.Lord Perth might begin by making clear that, the objectof the tripartite conversations was to pave the way forthe Anglo-Italian conversations c    Italy was anxious thatwe should recognise Abyssinia.    Ne had. told them that wecould, not do this without carrying the League of nations with us.    Our line, therefore, must be to create afavourable atmosphere for recognition at Geneva.   he himself ha^ hoped, that this might be done at the recent meeting, but, as the Italians had. been told, this hopehad been destroyed, by the action of submarines in theMediterranean and. by Signor Mussolini&apos;s message toGeneral Franco.    In a friendly way it could, be made clearthat the objects of the tripartite meetings were as hehad stated.If the policy succeeded, there might be someunfriendliness and. suspicion that we were trying to break the Berlin-Rome axis, and. it might be necessary to denythis.   He thought a favourable reply was not unlikely,but he agreed, with the Foreign Secretary that thisdepended upon what was happening in Berlin.    If theresult of the Berlin conversations was a deal between the
German and Italian Governments in which Germany had a free hand in Austria in return for support to Italy&apos;policy in the Mediterranean, there would be not much hope.Otherwise he saw a possibility of friendly conversations,and this was so important to peace that it was worthrunning some risks.A suggestion was ma.de that in order to avoid theobjections that had been raised, to a. joint Anglo-French note, it might be possible to arrange for France to issue the invitation.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thathe had always realised the objections to a joint Anglo-French Note.   He had, however, had to handle a situationwhich was somewhat acute from the French point of view.At Geneva the French had received what they believed tobe reliable information as to Italian reinforcements.In order to avert the risk that they might open theSpanish frontier he had felt bound, to agree to a jointapproach, and he saw great difficulty in getting out ofVarious suggestions were offered, which mightsurmount the difficulty.   For example, we might sayfrankly to the French that, we believed success was more likely to be achieved if the invitation came from us.   Asecond suggestion was that if the Paris Naval Conversa-t ion? succeeded, we might base the proposal to Italy onthe ground that this success ought to be followed up.A question was raised, as to how Italy was to be induced to withdraw the volunteers, the numbers of whichwere very large.    Was there any inducement except the threat of the French that otherwise they would open theSpanish frontier?   this, it was suggested, was not a merematter of minor adjustments, but. a very large and difficult point for Italy.itn 7,as-
^he Prime Minister pointed out that the maininducement vas the according of belligerent rights .The Lord President o^ the Council suggested thatour first effort should be to try and induce signor mussolini to withdraw the Italian volunteers.    It was unlikely that he could agree to this .   -,Ve should, then try and induce hin not to send any more volunteers and to tighten up the assurance? he had already given as to hisultimate aims.    In short, we should try and get all wecould on the second point, with a view to reassuring Prance.The Prime Minister said that we could not expect toget the withdrawal of all thf volunteers at the firsteffort.    Neither the Italians nor the Russians vere likelyto agree to that.    But we might be able to achieve thewithdrawal of part o^ the forces, or to induce theItalians to co-re out of Majorca..    The idea he had in view was to get a start.   The Cabinet could feel assured thathe end the Poreign Secretary would not let any opportunityslip for improving relations with Italy.   He thought they realised, however,  that it was impossible to separate the questions involved from Signor Mussolini1 s attitudetowards Spain and the Mediterranean.   He thought, that thePoreign Secretary fully realised and shared, the feelings of his  colleagues in the Cabinet and. that the latter couldendorse the Poreign Secretary&apos;? policy.The Cabinet agreed  To endorse the proposals of the PoreignSec^etar-y, as set forth above, for an Anglo-French a.pproa.ch to the Italian Governmentwith a view to tripartite conversations onthe non-intervention policy in Spain, andsimultaneous  conversations between HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Rome and. the italian foreign Secretary, in which the former would,explain the relation of the proposed, trypartite discussions to the Angle-Italian conversations.
4.    The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that already the Chinese Government wassuffering from a shortage of aeroplanes as well as of anti-aircraft ammunition.      The possibility ofa Chinese collapse could not be ruled out.      Hehad kept in touch with the American state department, but there was no more sign of anyanxiety on their part for joint action than therehad been when last the Cabinet met.      He was advised that any approach on our part would embarrass theAmerican Government and perhaps interfere with theexisting good relations.      The American Charged&apos;Affaires had spoken to him of the strongisolationist feeling in the United States.      Hehad instructed our Charge dTAffaires at washington to watch the situation carefully and report if anychange took place.      He thought our policy should beto take no step without the support of the UnitedStates of America.    . So far as the League of nations was concerned, the Secretary-General had made a.proposal for a resolution which appeared reasonable.In Germany opinion was reported to be dAvidedoDr.  Schacht was anxious to keep the German marketsin China, which were important to their exchange position, but Nazi sympathy was with Japan.      Hethought that we ought to do anything we couldtowards helping to clear up the situation if anopportunity offered.      He had intimated to theJapanese Government that we were prepared to do our best.      At the moment there was no other step opento us.
In reply to a question he said he was conscious of the dangers run by a go-between, but the longerthe present situation endured the worse it would befor everyone,  including China.      If the moment camefor some action of the kind, he would have toconsider whether to approach the United States,but he would not do so at this stage.The question was asked as to what should be theattitude of the Government towards the proposals inthe press for an economic boycott of Japan.The Prime Minister expressed the hope thatno-one would give any support to any such proposal.He was most anxious to avoid the position which hadbeen reached with Italy over Abyssinia.     As regardsthe prospects of peace, there seemed some ground forthe belief that both sides would welcome it.      HisMajesty&apos; s Ambassador in Japan had suggested that japan might now be willing to make peace on terms that were not too bad, and he thought thatGeneral Chiang-Kai-Shek would probably be glad to escape from the present position.A suggestion was made that if peace came about a.the result of our acting as a go-between, the ChineseGovernment would say that we had forced it on them.The Prime Minister thought it might be necessaryto risk that.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat,  in view of possible developments in publicopinion here, he did not want absolutely to exclude the possibility of an approach to the United states in the last resort, though he wanted to avoid it ifhe could.      No-one here knew that we had approached

No-one here knew that we load approached
the American Government at the beginning to co-operate with us in stopping the threatened developments.At the conclusion of this discussion theSecretarj&apos;&apos; of State for Foreign Affairs informed theCabinet that the Foreign Office and the treasury had agreed in the matter of the grant that parliament was to be asked to vote for His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in China, and an announcement would be made in the nearfuture.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs also referred to the attitude taken at Geneva by the HighCommissioner for New Zealand, who had expressedstrong views as to the policy that ought to beadopted and had reproached the Government in theUnited Kingdom,     He paid a tribute to therestraining influence of the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs said he had done his best, but one difficulty was that thepresent Government in New Zealand adopted the policyof the Labour Opposition here on this subject.The Prime Minister recalled that the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs had impressed on theNew Zealand representative that if His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were to adopt the policy they proposed,they would very soon have to extricate both themselves and New Zealand from the dangerous situation thatwould be created.
pB0CE. 5*    The Secretary of State for War, at the requestnjje secretary of the Prime Minister, made some remarks on hisif State forflar&apos;s Visit. recent visit to the French Manoeuvres.      The FrenchGovernment had done everything for the Britishvisitors and had treated them with great attention and kindness.      The French Army, in the view of his military advisers, was in fine fettle.      Inspiteof soaking weather the morale of the men had provedexcellent, notwithstanding the presence of a largeproportion of Reservists,      The war material alsoappeared to he very good.     He gave some particulars of the Maginot Lines, which he had been shown.    Thesealready covered the more immediate approaches toFrance from Germany and were to be extended on thenorth to Dunkirk and on the south to Nice.      He hadbeen assured by experts that these lines werevirtually impregnable to tanks or any other form of attack.      The Rhine bridges also were mined.      TheFrench realised that their aircraft position was bad,but believed that they could make the anti-aircraftground defences very strong by a veritable forest of guns.He thought that the spirit in France was improving and that there were signs already of thebeginning of a renaissance.      The tendency of theGermans was always to over-rate their achievementsbut that of the French was rather to under-rate them.This applied even in the case of the ParisExhibition, which was a great achievement.      TheFrench were inclined to over-stress the fact that its/
completion had teen delayed.      He gathered thatthe French did not expect us in the event of a future war to send a large number of divisions.What they wanted was two mechanised divisions.The reason for this v/as that the Maginot linesonly required a garrison of 100,000 troops, andthis left them plenty of men available for theirmobile forces.The Prime Minister thanked the Secretary ofState for War for his statement.
PALESTINE,        6.      The Cabinet had before them a Note by thePolicy of        Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP.-203 (37))His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.      circulating for the information of his colleaguesa copy of a letter from a group of Members of Parlia-0 (previous reference:     ment representative of responsible pro-Arab opinionCabinet 33(37), Con-     in this country, relating to the Palestine Policy of elusion 5.)His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Secretary of State for the Colonies saidthat his Note had only been circulated forinformation.      He then raised more important questions,that are dealt with in the Conclusion which follows.
PALESTINE oMurder ofBritishOfficials.The Mufti and!the ArabHigher Com-mittee,(previous reference:Cabinet 33(37), Con-clusion 5 .)7.     The Secretary of State for the Colonies drew the attention of the Cabinet to two telegrams dated september 27th, which had crossed, namely (l) a.private and personal telegram from himself to theOfficer Administering the Government in Palestine,giving the latter a preliminary indication of his views on the situation created by the recent murder of British Officials, and. asking whether the removalof the Mufti and the Arab Higher Committee would(a) tend, to put a stop to the murder campaign and(b) affect favourably or otherwise the prospect of future negotiations with Arabs in regard to the partition scheme:    and (2) telegram No, 435 to theSecretary of State from the Officer Administering theGovernment in Palestine, in which the latter discussedsteps that might be taken to diminish the power ofthe Mufti and of the Arab Higher Committee.The Secretary of State for the Coloniesexpressed the view that it was essential to take action in regard to the recent murders.     Mr. Andrewswas perhaps the most promising member of the PalestineCivil Service and had been attached to the RoyalCommission during their visit.      It was at his house that the Royal Commission had met tile Arab leaders and it was known that his name had been plaCvO firston the Mufti&apos;s black list.      The circumstances of the murder were most despicable, as Mr. Andrews, who had attended service in the Church of England where he had read the Lessons, had been shot as he left the building.
This murder had been accompanied by many othermurders of moderate Arabs, and a reign of terrorseemed to have been inaugurated.      No poliay could becarried through in Palestine if the situation was notdealt with.      He then read to the Cabinet a draft ofa telegram to the Officer Administering the Governmentwhich had been prepared in his absence by theColonial Office in consultation with the other government Departments concerned (Appendix I),  inwhich it was stated that the situation called forsome immediate and emphatic action demonstrating thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government would not tolerate acts of terrorism;    favouring the arrest of the Mufti as soonas opportunity offered, but accepting the view ofthe High Commissioner that arrest could not beeffected so long as the Mufti remained in the Haramarea;    agreeing that members of the Arab higher committee should be arrested, but without makingdistinctions between individuals or confining actionto the leading members only;    every member of theCommittee should be arrested at the earliest opportunity;    authorising the Officer administering the Government, unless he saw great reason to differ,to proceed with the utmost speed and secrecy to concert arrangements with the military and naval authorities for the arrest of these persons and theirdeportation to the Seychelles as soon as possible,and intimating that he was warning the Governor of theSeychelles;    arrests to be followed by the issue of aGovernment communique making clear that action was
taken as a direct result of the revival of the murdercampaign and on grounds of public security, inthe exercise of the High Commissioner s powers underthe Defence Order-in-Council;    as the Mufti was liableto arrest and deportation if and when he emerged fromhis present security,  the logical consequence wouldbe that legislative action should be taken to relievehim of the Presidency of the Supreme Moslem Counciland the Chairmanship of the Wakf Committee and as faras possible to cut off his communications with the outside world. -The Secretary of State for the Colonies alsoread a fresh telegram that had been received from theOfficer Administering the Government in Palestine(Appendix II).In the course of a somewhat prolonged discussion the Secretary of State for the Colonies accepted asuggestion that the Arab Higher Committee and allnational Committees should be declared illegal, sinceif this was not done it was probable that newCommittees would be set up to replace them.      He also accepted a suggestion that the Mufti should be deprived by legislative action of every officialfunction.The Secretary of State for India, while agreeing to the action proposed by the Secretary of State forthe Colonies,  reminded the Cabinet that this wouldhave some repercussions in India.     He was anxious thatno action should be taken which could be described asa desecration of the Holy Places.     He hoped, therefore,that the Secretary of State for the Colonies would
think very seriously before taking any steps to layhands on the Grand Mufti as long as he remained inthe Haram area.The Secretary of State for the Colonies agreed.Some doubts were expressed as to whether theaction now proposed would be considered as sufficientlydrastic, and the suggestion was made that it shouldbe followed by a declaration of martial law, at anyrate in some districts.     This was supported on thegrounds that officers of the civil Government were bound at every juncture to weigh the question as towhether the course they wished to take was inaccordance with their legal powers, whereas themilitary authorities would not be hampered if martial law had been declared.The Secretary of State for War said that theGeneral Staff were apprehensive of further murders,and thought that the present proposals might in theend lead to the need for more troops.      He hoped thatthe Colonial Secretary would consult the General Staffon the subject.The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointedout that if martial law was declared it would benecessary, as the Royal Commission had pointed out, for it to apply to the whole country.      He wished, before a decision was taken, to have an opportunity of consulting his own advisers in London, otherDepartments concerned and the Officer administering the Government in Palestine.
The Prime Minister said that he did not think the Cabinet ought to urge the Colonial Secretary totake a decision here and now.      If the cabinet approved, he proposed that the Secretary of State forthe Colonies should be authorised to take the actionwhich he had already suggested and that he should beasked to consider the question of martial law inconsultation with his advisers in the Colonial Office,the Officer Administering the Government in palestine and the General Staff and other Departments concerned.The suggestion was made, and agreed to, thatthe Secretary of State for the Colonies should beauthorised to sanction a proclamation of martial lawwithout coming back to the Cabinet if he considered necessary.The Prime Minister said that he had the sameproposal in mind.The Cabinet agreed:-To authorise the Secretary of State forthe Colonies as follows(a) To send a telegram on the linesof the draft in Appendix I(which has been amended toinclude the alterations suggested at the Meeting);    and(b) To consult his advisers in theColonial Office,  the OfficerAdministering the Government inPalestine, the General Staff ofthe War Office and the otherDepartments concerned as to thedesirability of proclaimingmartial law;    and, if he considered desirable, to instruct the Officer administering the Government to proclaim it.
RAID$CAUTIONS[got ia-t ions[th the Localtthorities .previous reference:Cabinet 33137) , Con-Id us ion 3 .)8o    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary (0.P.-216 (37)) on the subject of theallocation of Air Raid Precautions expenditure betweenthe Exchequer and Local Authorities.   The Memorandumrecalled that at the Meeting mentioned in the marginthe question of principle had. been postponed until further soundings had been taken as to the attitude ofthe Local Authorities, which had refused, to discussthe proposal o? a 50 per cent, grant and had said thatthe whole cost should, be borne by the Exchequer.   Allthe information the T-Iome Secretary had been able toobtain amongst Members of Parliament and members ofLocal Authorities shewed, that nothing less than 75per cent, would  gain support.   He himself urged thatthe Cabinet should decide both to pay the whole costof the fire appliances and other equipment, none ofwhich could be said to have a. peace-time value, and toprovide 7^ per c^nt. of the remaining expenditure.This increase in Government financial liability would,the Home Secretary believed, decrease enormously thedanger o^ prolonged and. widespread opposition.    Ifsuch a decision were taken and a statement issued onthe lines of the draft attached to his Memorandum, he felt that so large a. measure of support would besecured that there would be little difficulty in meet-ing such opposition as might remain and in bringing into operation an enabling Act without compulsoryprovisions.The Prime Minister said he had received aletter from the Chancellor of the Exchequer who didnot agree in the proposed 75 per cent, grant to localauthorities, though he was willing to agree to 60 percento     In the circumstances, he could not ask theCabinet to take a decision contrary to the Cliepo^Lljor
of the Exchequer&apos;s view though, of course, if they were willing, they could decide in accordance therewith.     Hethought that a short discussion might he useful.The Home Secretary recalled the previous discussion of the Cabinet at which he had proposed to differentiate between capital expenditure which shouldbe paid for by the Government, and maintenance which shouldbe shared with the local authorities.     In subsequent discussions, this had not been found to be a very workableplan.     He recalled that at the Cabinet, the matter had been left for him to discuss further with the local authorities.nn&amp; difficulty had been that the local authorities were on.vacation but, nevertheless, some consultations had takenplace.     There had also been inter-departmentaldiscussions and certain conclusions had been reached.All those consulted had agreed that no good object couldbe served by introducing a Bill with compulsory powers.The officials of the Ministry of Health had taken theview that such powers would be very difficult to operate.They would involve a long wrangle on matters on whichwilling co-operation was essential and it would be verydifficult for the Government to impose its wishes.Secondly, it had been agreed that it would be of no use to ask the local authorities to meet the Government again and duscuss the matter with a clean slate.     In that event, the local authorities would behave exactly as before.     The only wise course, therefore, was for theCabinet to announce its policy and invite the localauthorities to discuss details.     The inter-departmentaldiscussions had shown agreement that that was the only possible policy.     One new factor in the situation wasthat public opinion, perhaps as the result of the shanghai and Nanking air attacks, had become more exci-tedon the question.     This was shown by the somewhat- 26 -
irritable attitude of the local authorities.     the atmosphere was already worse than in July and was likelyto deteriorate still further.     He did not like the ideaof meeting Parliament without a prior announcement ofthe policy of the Government which should first obtainacceptance by some of the more important localauthorities.     So far a distinction had been drawn betweenequipment that had no peace-time value and the maintenanceof services that were an extension in war of peace-timeservices.     As to the former category, he thought therewas     general agreement that the Government ought to pay1O0 per cent and that fire appliances should be includedin this category, since that involved apparatus thatwas not necessary in time of peace and which would beavailable to be moved from one place to anothere.     Thequestion remained as to how to deal with those services in which the local authorities had a direct concern.In the previous negotiations he had offered 50 per cent which had been rejected.     Afterwards he had seen a parliamentary Committee as the result of which aDeputation of Members of Parliament had met him and had suggested 75 per cent as a reasonable figure.     He was assured that a figure of less than 75 per cent would not enable the Government to break the common front which hadbeen created by Mr. Morrison.     The Government would get a rebuff    and    would not be able to pass their bill through a hostile House of Commons.     If, within thenext fortnight, he could obtain authority to act on the linesOf his new proposals, including the 75 per cent., he thought hecould bring about an agreementc   Air Raid Precautions were a vital part of National Defence and it was imperative togo ahead with them. All foreign countries were taking
action and the evidence went toshow that the Germans hadalready spent as much as  500,000,000 on Air Raid   &apos;Precautions.     He did not ask the Cabinet to adopt anyparticular sum, but he would ask for an early decision andan early announcement of the Government&apos;s policy, leaving the amount to be settled later.The Minister of Health sympathised stronglywith the difficulties of the Home Secretary.     He felt some doubt, however, on two points.     First, as to whetherit would be wise to offer 75 per cent, as a flat grant.That would be a reversal of the usual policy.(The Minister of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries left at this point.)The general policy in the matter of grants had hitherto been on the basis of need.     If 75 per cent, were adopted as a flat grant, the Government would be pressed by the weaker local authorities that they   ought to receive more and they might be driven to 100 per cent, in theircasei     Secondly, he had doubts as to whether the Governmentshould not include compulsion in their legislation.     If they didnot make it a duty of the local authorities to co-operate *Mr. Morrison might say that he felt so strongly on thematter that until the Government gave justice on thesubject, he would not move a step.     On the other hand,if co-operation was imposed as a duty, he thought thatMr. Morrison was hardly likely to refuse.     He thought thatthe Shanghai and Nanking raids had probably been helpful in moving public opinion.     He thought that the HomeSecretary would be able to carry public opinion with him and that perhaps the local authorities were playing theirhand rather highe     Incidently, he mentioned that in a recent visit to Prague, he found that they had done nothing inthis matter.
The Prime Minister agreed with the HomeSecretary that it was high time this matter was settled and that the policy must be decided before parliament met.He thought that the matters on which disagreement existedwere not questions of principle hut of relative detail.No decision could he taken in the absence of the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the best plan would be to- remit it to aCabinet Committee which he proposed, if the Cabinet agree,should have power to take a decision.The Cab-net agreed:That a Cabinet Committee composed asfollows:-The Prime Minister      (in the Ghair)The chancellor of the exchequer the Home secretary the Secretary of State for scotland the Minister of health should deal with the questions raised bythe Home Secretary in CP. 216 (37) with power to take decisions on behalf of theCabinet.29 -
india..c eyf rear O-asigftinst Unlawfuligsemblies.(previous inference:Cabinet 57(36), Con-oluaion 16.;Note.     After broaching the question of theTrade Negotiations with India, theCabinet adjourned at 1,20 pem. until2045 p.m00- 30 -9.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for India (CP.-205 (37)) recallingthat at the Meeting referred to in the margin approvalhad been piven to a proposal by the Government ofIndia that the Punjab Government should be permitted to use tear gas against unlawful assemblies, subjectto the following conditions&quot;(a) That suitable equipment and police trained in its use are available;    and(b) That the Local Government is satisfiedthat the occasion and circumstances are appropriate for the use of tear gas&quot;?also that any other Local Government might be permitted to use tear gas on the same conditions.    Since then,however. Provincial Autonomy had been inaugurated, andthe Government of India had reached the conclusionthat they had no power to compel Provincial governments to observe any such restrictions.    The Government ofIndia had suggested, however, that if any provincial government decided, to authorise the use of tear gas,these conditions would, no doubt commend themselves asa proper and. necessary precaution.The Secretary of State for India said thathis only object in circulating this memorandum wasto bring to the attention of the Cabinet the changein the constitutional position in India in its effect on the use of tear gas.
india.paAe Nego-tiations .(previousoeferencetCabinet 58(36), Oon-clusion 9 8cappendix.)10e   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (CP.-219 (37))outlining the demands put forward by the indian delegation in the negotiations for the revision of the ottawa Agreement, which the Government of India haddenounced on the motion of the Indian LegislativeAssembly.   These demands so far exceeded anything he himself envisaged that, notwithstanding that a settle-ment of the Lancashire cotton piece-goods problem inIndia on terms satisfactory to all parties was an object for which it would be worth paying a consider-able price, he feared, that he had no alternative butto inform the Indian Delegation that he could not commend to the Cabinet or to Parliament a settlement on this basis.   His colleagues should, however, be aware that Lancashire had been informed by the unofficial advisers of the Indian Delegation of thedemands put forward, and had been induced, to bring pressure on the Board, of Trade to conclude an agreement on the lines desired by the Indians.    It was likely,therefore, if the demands of the Indian delegation were refused, that the Government would be faced, almost immediately by strong political pressure, and, when its decision became known, by a public campaign of consider-able violence.The President of the Board of Trade, developing the statement in his memorandum, warned the Cabinetthat the Indian Trade Negotiations were threatened with collapsea     He recalled that the Ottawa agreement had been opposed by the Indian Legislature.     Theofficial spokesman of the Government had defended theAgreement bu.t had intimated that if the Legislaturevoted against it, the Government would take it as an- 31 -
instruction to bring it to an end.     The Legislaturehad voted against the Agreement.     In operation, theAgreement had actually inured more to India!s benefitthan to ours.     He himself had felt that if the Indianofficials had said the Agreement v/as a good one, it mustbe favourable to India, but had realised that the delegation from India could not go back without some change in its terms0     He had decided,  therefore, to aim at an Agreement in which advantages would be obtained for the Lancashire cotton industry which would outweighconcessions made on other points.     Before the ParliamentaryRecess he had succeeded in getting the representatives ofthe cotton industry into touch with seven unofficialadvisers who had accompanied the Indian Delegation.No progress had been made before the Recess, but up to lastweek an Agreement had appeared possible on the general lines he was aiming at       Last week, however, the Indianmill owners had said that they would agree to someproposals conveyed in a letter from the Lancashire .representatives, provided the Board of Trade would acceptwhat they had told the cotton representatives were reasonabledemands.     He then explained the difference between these demands and our own desiderata.   &quot;The:.new proposals involvedvery large sacrifices by British trade in return for con-cessions to the cotton industry which were unspecified so faras the rate of preference v/as concerned.      On the dayfollowing that on which he had received this information the official negotiations had been resumed.     Sir ZafrullahKhan had intimated that if His Majesty&apos;s Government wantedan Agreement they must make it with the unofficialrepresentatives,&apos;    that he could not act as a go-between;and that the Government of India&apos;s attitude was likely to
&quot;be the same as that \f their unofficial advisers.In these circumstances.,  the President of theBoard of Trade asked authority to give an unqualified refusal to the present offer huth e      warned the Cabinet that it might lead to a breakdown in the negotiations.     At one time he hadfeared that the Lancashire cotton representatives mightbe willing to sacrifice the other industries that hadbenefited   from the Ottawa Agreement, but he had seensome of their leaders who realised that the Governmentcould not accept the latest cffere     He was most anxious that the negotiations should not break down and he didnot dismiss the possibility of a reasonable basis still being foundo     He felt, however, that he ought to warn the Cabinet that he considered the present proposalsfantastic,and of the dangers involved in their rejection.The Secretary of State for India said he had had no direct part in these negotiations as SirZafrullah Khan, a member of the Government of India, hadconducted them and had been assisted by both official and unofficial representatives.     Nevertheless, he was interested because, if the negotiations broke down, abitter feeling would be created.     Referring to thePresident of the Board of Trade&apos;s statement that theGovernment of India had considered the Ottawa Agreementfair to both parties, he said that as that government wished to maintain the Agreement they had naturallydefended it.       But the Legislative Assembly, who hadthe last word, did not agree and had denounced theAgreements     Since that time it had been carried on frommonth to month pending the negotiation   of a new agreement.     He sympathised with the President of the Board- 33 -
Of Trade in his view that the proposal of the indian delegation would he a hard bargain for this country.     Therewas, however, another side to the question.     The indian delegation would find it impossible to defend the proposalsof the President of the Board of Trade.     The iron andsteel industries, he recalled, were not covered by the ottawa Agreement but by a separate agreement and this applied also to the cotton industry.     The proposals of theIndian Delegation involved our surrendering  10,500,000of preference out of  15,000,000 covered by the OttwwaAgreement.     The President of the Board of Trade had onlyoffered to surrender  600,000, although he thought as a last resort he might be prepared to surrender a gpod deal more.       (The President of the Board of Trade said he hadnot intimated that to the Indian Delegation.)    In return,he asked for concessions to Lancashire and to impose a quotaon India in respect of the jute trade in the interests ofDundee.     If the President of the Board of Trade could notdefend the Indian proposal, the Indian Delegation could notdefend his.     The gulf, therefore, between the two appearedvery wide.     He had been told, however, that in order to getsome agreement %he G-u v ci&apos;i-the  ^t--.^jsU n&amp;ia^-action withe^fe--tittr,i,sup-porbrrr&amp; the /non-official representatives^ would agree^ to j^f^irlv^ satts^satisfactory^ -ikj^uhxsarrangement for Lancashire.   /T*e--ne^-e&apos;^irei^ /ItI-L^   u* cm   &quot;I^ju^ t*xuz- ftk.^ mu^u^L 7W- 7Nj r\t^uti*J&quot; lo-t-uJJ.        nJufiK.howeveri--wou^7HRet^-g^&apos; they-had demanded.     He was most anxious to avoid a breakdown.The difficilty was that the non-official representatives were leaving for India next Monday*     If they were presented withan ultimatum, they would go back to India and there would beno agreement.     He appealed to the President of the Board ofTrade not to present an ultimatum but to intimate that he- 34 -
might go further in the surrender of preference, providedthat the Indian Delegation could accept a satisfactory agreement on cotton.     The alternative, he pointed out, wasa complete loss of the Ottawa preferences and theimposition here of heavy duties, for example, on imported jute.Even in India, however, the jute industry was in Scotchhands so that Scotch interests would he adversely affected.He suggested also that India was in a stronger position than this country In the negotiations for the reason thatour exports consisted mainly of manufactures and theirsmainly of raw materials which were necessary to us and onwhich we could hardly impose duties without affectingourselves adversely.     He thought there was room for a closer negotiation.The President of the Board of Trade said he wasonly too anxious to get an Agreement.     He had, however, no indication that the unofficial Indian representatives wereprepared to make any concession or that the officials would help in the natter.     He felt &quot;bound to give an indication that he could not accept the proposals and that the twoDelegations were far apart.     One difficulty was that he did not know the mind of the Indian unofficial representatives in thematter of the cotton industry.     The present duty on Britishcotton was 20 per cent.     If this was to be reduced, forexample, only to 15 per cent., we could not offer muoh.His Idea when he met the Indian Delegation on Monday was first to reject their proposals and then to suggest somesliding scale of concessions based on what they would offer on cotton.     India, he pointed out, was at the moment inrather a weak position on cotton, owing to the withdrawalof Japan from that market0- 35 -
The Lord President of the Council agreed thatit was impossible for the Cabinet to tie the hands ofthe President of the Board of Trade, but he asked   him togive weight to the wider political reactions referred toby the Secretary of State for IndiaD     He thought this wasa case for a long view0      If a breakdown    occurred in the trade agreements, it would be difficult to get back.      It would be worth while to go a long way tosecure the goodwill of India and any arrangement might be accompanied by a gentlemen7s agreement that if thearrangement did not work well, it would be considered in two or three year&apos;s time.     Apart from that, he thought the matter should be left to the President of the Board ofTrade.The President of the Board of Trade said that hehad in mind something of the kind when he made his offer.The difficulty was that the unofficial advisers of theIndian Delegation refused to disclose their offer on cotton until they got a concession on the other points.The Secretary of State for India thought thatone of our objects should be to create a vested interestin India with trade with this country.      He thought we ought to go a long way in order to get an agreement on cotton.The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence saidthat from the point of view of Imperial Defence, we were concerned in Indian jute,which was essential if the enormous orders for sandbags were to be executed.The President of the Board of Trade said thatthe jute position was safeguarded by the fact that large orders had been given.
The Prime Minister said that it was a verydifficult for the Cabinet to make practical suggestions inthis matter.     He felt sure that the President of the Boardof Trade would take into account all the questions that had been raised.     It was clear, however, that   there was apoint beyond which we could not be forced to go a
11,   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the. President of the Board of Trade (CP.-217 (37)) seeking authority for the preparation arid submission to theCommittee of Home Affairs of a short Bill to amendSection 163 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, whichin its present form constituted an obstacle to theintroduction of the volunta-ry national pensions schemefor officers of the Merchant. Navy recently preparedby the National Maritime Board.    The proposal wasthat the Section shoul^ be altered, so as to permit of the assignment of wages for the purpose of pensionscontributions, and that steps should be taken to securethe passage of the Bill into law by the 31st december next in order to enable the scheme to come into opera-tion at the beginning of next year.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To authorise the preparation of ashort Bill for submission to theGommittee of Home Affairs to amendSection 163 of the MerchantShipping Act. 1894, as proposed bythe President of the Board of Tradein his memorandum (CP.  217 (37)):(b) That the Bill should be introduced in the House of Lords.
SHIPS .DefensiveArming of.PR.3 (3.7)/2. -IT    12. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty ( CP.-215 (37))  containing proposals for the stiffening of British merchant ships to enable them to take defensive armament, the costof which the Admiralty considered should be accepted as a Government liability.    Over 3,000 guns of 4&quot;calibre or larger, and over 1,000 12-pdr. guns were already available for issue to merchant ships, and supplies of ammunition were being built up.      Theprovision of a suitable anti-aircraft weapon had. alsobeen approved.    This equipment, however,  could not befitted into merchant ships unless and until thenecessary stiffening to enable the decks to take tlEgun mountings had been incorporated.    The average cost of stiffening a ship during construction, ifincluded in the original design, was estimated to amount to  200 only per ship, but if done aftercompletion of the ship the cost might reach as muchas  1,200 per ship.    The Admiralty therefore put forward the following proposals:-(a) To undertake to meet the cost of stiffeningduring construction all suitable merchantvessels of 500 tons gross and over for oneL.A. gun and one A.A. gun at an estimatedannual cost of  32,400.(b) To expend a further amount annually, for such period as is necessary,  in stiffening such vessels already built a.s may be selected for the purpose.    mhe annual expenditure under this head, is provisionally estimatedat  50,000.    This would, enable 66 shipson an average to be stiffened annually, butthe provision would be required, only for alimited period.After the First Lord of the Admiralty had developed the proposals in his memorandum, the PrimeMinister said that there were three classes of shipsinvolved -Ships already built and in commissionShips under constructionShips to be built in the future.
As regards the second class, he recognised thatit would he very expensive to strengthen the ships after they had been completed,.      In these circumstances,  theTreasury were willing to find the whole cost in these cases.The sum involved was not very large but, at the present time,a large number of ships were under construction and theopportunity was a good one to strengthen them.As regards the third class, he thought that the shipowners ought to be pressed to strengthen them themselves.When they were dealing with shipbuilding firms competingfor tenders the additional cost involved should not be verygreato      It was difficult to pledge the Treasury for an indefinite periodsAs regards the first category, namely, ships already built and in commission, there was less urgency.The real urgent question arose in respect of the secondcategory and he did not think it was necessary to go beyond that at the momenteIn the course of a short discussion, the question was raised as to what proportion of merchant vessels theAdmiralty desired to stiffen,.     The words in (a) &quot;all suitablemerchant vessels of 500 tons gross and over&quot; and in (b) &quot;such vessels already built as may be selected&quot; were felt, to be somewhat vague and required further elucidation0The Cabinet agreed:(a) That, the subject should be discussed again at the next weekly meeting of the cabinet when the Chancellor of the exchequer would be present:(b) That the First Lord of the Admiralty (whois proceeding on official duty to theMediterranean) should depute someone torepresent him at this meeting:(c) That the Admiralty should be asked, togive further information as to the classes of ship which they desired tostrengthen^,

G. will not tolerate acts of terrorism.As regards various possible measures discussed in your telegram, (a) I am all for arresting Mufti assoon as opportunity presents itself, but I am satisfied,  in light of advice furnished in HighCommissioner^ private and personal telegram of20th July,  that arrest cannot be effected so longas person named remains in Haram area.      It would&apos;clearly be worse than useless to make an attemptthat had no chance of success,(b) I approve declaration of Arab Higher Committeeand all.National Committees to be illegal bodies.In any case, immediate needs of situation seem tome to require more drastic action such as thatindicated, below.(c) I agree that members of Arab Higher Committeeshould be arrested, but I do not think it practicable to make distinctions between individuals or to confine action to leading members only.      In-1-
my judgment, situation can &quot;oe met only Toy arrest and deportation of every member of the Committee atearliest possible opportunity.      In case of Muftihimself,  it is to be feared that early opportunityis unlikely to arise, but I trust that there willbe no serious difficulty in laying hands upon the others.Unless,  therefore, you see grave reason todiffer, you siiould proceed with the utmost speed and secrecy to concert arrangements with militaryand naval authorities for arrest of these persons and their deportation to Seychelles.      Essentialnot only that arrests should be effected as soon aspossible, but also that deportation should followwith minimum of delay.      I am warning Governor ofSeychelles.After action has been taken issue of Governmentcommunique will be desirable.      This might, if onlyin order to make it clear that action taken isdirect result of revival of murder campaign,  start by reciting facts of recent murders and go on tosay that in the light of these events, HighCommissioner has found it necessary on ground ofpublic security to take action against the membersof the Committee which must be regarded as morallyresponsible in the exercise, of his powers under theDefence Order in Council.As regards Mufti himself, he will be liable to arrest and deportation if and when he emerges fromhis present sanctuary.      That being so, logicalconsequence would seem to be that legislative action should be taken to relieve him of Presidency
of Supreme Moslem Council and Chairmanship of WakfCommittee and of every official function.      steps should presumably also be taken as far as may bepossible to cut off all his communications with the outer world.
APPENDIX II.CYPHER TELEGRAM from the Officer Administering theGovernment of Palestine to the Secretary of State for.theColonies.Dated 29th September, 1937.      Received 6.7 a.m., 29th Sept.IMMEDIATE.Private and Personal,,      Your Private and Personal telegramof September 27th.      Criticisms to be expected were to large extent made to me today by representative of jewish agency who urged me to arrest the Mufti and Arab higher committee stating that until this was done terrorism would never cease in Palestine.      This is the view which hasbeen consistently pressed upon me during the past threeweeks.      He added that if the Government was not preparedto take such steps then Army should but he hoped that thiswould not happen as he thought that the Government coulddeal with the existing situation.2. I am not in possession of information from any source tending to implicate Arab Higher Committee as a body or any of its individual members or any other person or organisations in or out of Palestine as promoting orencouraging this campaign of terrorism except the following;(a) A reliable source reported that the Mufti on his visit to Damascus earlier in the year had frequent interviews with known assassins.(b) Many of Arab Higher Committee are known to beterroris ts.(c) There is reliable information that an organisationexists in Damascus which is believed to be responsible for .the direction of certain assassinations which have occurred in Palestine,
3. My personal views are that responsibility must reston the Mufti and some of the Arab Higher Committee that theyat least condoned and possibly inspired many of terroristacts.      Terrorists must be paid and we believe that funds are available at the disposal of the Mufti.4. Removal by way of deportation of leading membersof Arab Higher Committee might tend to put a stop toassassinations but I feel bound to say that some murdersare, in my opinion, now being carried out by extremistswho are working independently of the Arab Higher Committeeand that deportations may possibly lead to temporaryextensions of crimes of violence.      But deportations wouldcertainly in the long run have a salutary effect.5. If the Mufti could be deported with other leading members of the Arab Higher Committee then I think this measure would have favourable effect on future negotiationswith Arabs.     But while the Mufti is still in Haram thendeportation of Arab Higher Committee members and declarationof Committee as illegal body would probably mean that negotiations for settlement would be quite abortive.      Butas I indicated yesterday present hope of satisfactorynegotiations is practically nil.6. I have arrested under the Emergency Regulationto date 117 Arabs who are believed to be terrorists or who are political undesirables in the north.I intend to extend this to arrest of believedterrorists in the rest of Palestine.      This may mean afurther two or three hundred arrests.      Protests are beingmade and are likely to become stronger in regard to thepresent arrests but I am confident that this policy shouldcontinue until we have rounded up all likely Arab gunmen ini
Palestine though this will he likely to raise tension inthe country.7. But I am persuaded that action suggested inparagraph 6 above is not in itself adequate to meet thesituation created by the murder of Andrews.      If the morale of the Administration and Police is to be preserved andthe confidence of the general public in the ability ofGovernment to discharge its essential functions is to bemaintained then I consider that the following steps shouldbe taken within the shortest possible time.(a) The declaration of Arab Higher Committee and national Committees as illegal bodies.(b) The arrest and deportation of several of theleading members of the Arab Higher Committee,(c) The deposition of Haj Amin as President ofthe Supreme Moslem Council and Chairman of*vVaqf Committee.?       ?You will realise that this step must lead to a great dealof confusion in the administration of Waqf funds and theprobable refusal of Sharia courts to function lasting overa long period but I consider that this issue must be faced.This would have happened in July if attempt to arrest anddeport the Mufti had been successful.      In my telegram ofyesterday I raised the question of public justification for these acts.8. I cannot definitely state that the assassinationcampaign will cease if these steps are taken or that therewill be no other undesirable repercussions in Palestine or outside.     And it is within the bounds of possibility thatthe apparent calm in the country will be violently shakenby these acts which would result in military measuresbecoming necessary in the near future.     But murder of a
senior Government official is such a direct challenge tothe authority of the Government that it seems to menecessary that strong action should he taken against thosewho we know definitely are violently opposed to partitionpolicy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, who have been to alarge degree responsible for last year&apos;s rebellion on theirLands and on whom gravest suspicion of being connected withterrorist acts must rest.9. In view of possible consequences of measures proposed herein you may wish to consult Sir Arthur Wauchope.The Executive Council and General v/avell concurs in conclusions reached in this telegram.10. Investigation is still proceeding in the case of   jAndrews murder.\-iv-
