ElG-N AFFAIRS:[situationPHE FAR SaST-in theJlTERRANEAN.II Attack only Majesty*sjiassador inKia:   TheHfetion of theJgBidrawal of 11 Ma jesty *sfilassador ingpo in CertainBits.1.   The Cabinet had before them a Note by the deputy Secretary (Paper CP. 208 (37)) covering the draft Notes of a Meeting of Ministers held atthe Foreign Office on Thursday, 2nd September, 1937,for the examination of certain urgent questionswhich had arisen in connection with recent develop-rnents in the situation in the Far East and in theMediterranean.     At this Meeting four questions hadbeen specifically reserved for consideration by theCabinet.The Cabinet were reminded by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs that when the Meeting ofMinisters had discussed the question of the attackon His Majesty*s Ambassador in China it had beenagreed inter alia that the question of the withdrawalof our Ambassador in Tokyo should be reserved for thedecision of the Cabinet at their Meeting onSeptember 8th, when the Cabinet could reach a decision in the light of further developments and information(see Conclusion 2 on page 11 of Notes of Meeting,Paper CP. 208 (37)),Since the Meeting of Ministers an interim reply had been received from the Japanese Government (forthe text of which see Appendix I).     This interimreply could not in the view of the Secretary of Statebe regarded as satisfactory, and if the final reply of the Japanese Government was similar in character to their interim reply the final reply would have tobe regarded as unsatisfactory.     Sir Robert Craigiehad been so informed, and we had also expressed, to him the hope that the Japanese final reply would not be unduly delayed.     The Secretary of State suggested-1-
that the Cabinet might wish to consider what action should he taken in the not improbable event of theJapanese final reply proving unsatisfactory.The Prime Minister thought that examination bythe Cabinet of the procedure to be followed in theevent of the Japanese final reply proving unsatisfactorywould be valuableo     At the Meeting of Ministers onthe 2nd September it had been assumed that the finalreply of the Japanese Government would by now havebeen received,,      In the events which had happened allthat we had got at present was an interim reply which,while friendly and conciliatory in tone, was undoubtedlyunsatisfactory.      The reply intimated that theJapanese investigations had so far failed to produce any evidence to establish that a Japanese aeroplanehad been guilty of the outrage, and that in thesecircumstances it was still impossible to determine whether or not any responsibility for the incidentrested with the Japanese Government.      The interimreply added insult to injury by suggesting that inorder to prevent the recurrence of such an incidentwe should co-operate with the Japanese authorities onthe spot by giving them notice in advance when Britishsubjects proposed to enter a danger zone.      It lookedvery much as if the Japanese were adopting the samedilatory and unsatisfactory attitude which they hadtaken up in the Keelung affair.He (the Prime Minister) did not believe that theJapanese Government dared to go further in thedirection of giving us satisfaction in view of theviolent manner in which the Japanese military and naval elements would react.      It should be observed
in particular that the Japanese had so far failedto tender any apology, and to undertake suitably topunish those responsible for the attack, two of therequirements contained in our Note to the JapaneseGovernment of the 28th August, 1937,He (the Prime Minister) had been consideringthe suggestion that our Ambassador in Tokyo shouldbe withdrawn in the absence of any satisfactoryreply, and he wished to suggest to the Cabinet analternative proposal which he had had no opportunityas yet of discussing with any of his colleagues.     he assumed that the Cabinet would a;.?;ree that we couldnot simply acquiesce and do nothing, but the difficulty that he foresaw about withdrawing our Ambassador fromTokyo was that such action would not seriously injureJapan, and would moreover leave the situation entirelyunliquidated.      Should we withdraw our Ambassador thetime would come in the future when it would benecessary that he should return to Tokyo.      It was most improbable that in the interval the JapaneseGovernment would give us the satisfaction we weredemanding, and we should then be placed in a humiliatingand embarrassing position.      In order to avoiddifficulties of this Icind he proposed that the action tobe taken should consist of two parts.      In the firstplace we should answer the final reply of the JapaneseGovernment (assuming that reply to be unsatisfactory)in stinging terms, to the following effectWe had received their final reply with disappoint-rnent and regret.      Having regard to the undoubted
fact, as proved beyond question by evidence in ourpossession, that this Outrage had been committed by a Japanese airman, we could not understand thefailure at once to comply with our reasonable andmoderate demands.     As the Japanese Government didnot feel able to take this course, in this secondcase where a British subject had been subjected togross outrage by persons in the service of theJapanese Government, we did not consider that it wasconsonant with our own dignity to press them further in the matter, as apparently in matters of thiskind Japan was unable to attain to the normalstandards observed among civilized peoples.      Inthis way the incident could be closed by us withdignity and without loss of prestige.Secondly, he (the Prime Minister) thought thatan announcement should be made very soon after thedespatch of our reply to Japan to the effect that inview of the grievous injuries sustained by HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador and the possible prejudice tohis future health resulting from the outrage, theGovernment had decided to make a compensatory grant to him of  5,000.      Such action would relieve the mind of the Ambassador from undue anxiety.If we proceeded on these lines, the incidentwould be liquidated in a way which he thought publicopinion would approve, and it would be unnecessary to consider further the question of withdrawingSir R. Craigie from Tokyo.
The Secretary of State for India was of opinionthat the Japanese would only pay attention to force,or to the display of force,.      Rebukes? however stronglyworded, would have no effect upon them and wouldcertainly not deter them from committing furtheroutrages-The Minister of Health favoured the line suggest-ed by the Prime Minister and doubted whether theJapanese would be much impressed by the withdrawal ofour Ambassador from Tokyo-      Moreover,  the difficultyregarding the Canadian Minister in Tokyo would remain.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs saidthat the position in regard to the Canadian Ministerpresented no immediate difficulty.      The canadian minister had been spending his leave in Victoria,British Columbia,  and had been due to return to japan on 4thc  September.    He had been instructed by theCanadian Government to postpone his return indefinitely.Should it be decided to withdraw Sir Robert Craigieit would be very quickly realised in Japan that theCanadian Government, by postponing the return of theirMinister to Tokyo, were keeping in step with us.     -He-thought that the difficulty of getting the Ambassadorback once he had been withdrawn was a very grave one,and it would be every bit as embarrassing and difficult for the Canadian Government to allow\their Ministerto return if hewas withdrawn as it wou\ld be for us in.the case of Ho Mo Ambassador^ aJfe^atu^ ^tf&amp;tal WeAyThe Secretary of State for the Colo*nies thoughtthat a profound sensation would be caused j&amp;n Japanif we were to brand the Japanese as not comiiP-g upto ordinary civilised standards.
The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs agreed and wanted the Cabinet that the Japanese might,on receipt of a Note of the kind contemplated by thePrime Minister, decide to sever diplomatic relationswith uso      It was very difficult indeed correctly to assess Japanese mentality but there was no doubt thatthey would attach great importance to our withdrawingour Ambassador..      There were, of course, precedents for withdrawing Ambassadors,  and no insuperable difficulties had been found in other cases in re-suming normal diplomatic relations.      In a year&apos;s time the whole situation in the Far East might havebeen profoundly altered, possibly to the detriment of the Japanese,who might then be much more anxious for our friendship than they were at presentsHe was in full agreement with the Prime Minister&apos;suggestion that a pecuniary grant should be made toSir Hughs Knatchbull-Hugesseno      He did not think thatany decision on the question of withdrawing our ambassador need,  as yet, be taken by the Cabinet.The Prime Minister agreed that no decisionneed be taken that day.Some discussion then took place as to whether we could regard as satisfactory anything short of full compliance with the three requirements in ourNote of August 28tho      In this oonnecvtioh theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attent-ion to the following passage in his telegraphing ^331 No.284 of the 7th.  September to Sir R. Craigie :&quot;Expressions of regret accompanied bydisclaimers of responsibility do notapproximate to an,apology, though I agree that regret coupled withadmission ,of responsibility (Yourtelegram Nbc  360; would meet the case.&quot;
The view was expressed that it would he unwisefor us to insist on the punishment of the actualperpetrators of the outrage, and that in any case itwould he very difficult to insist on our secondrequirement, namely,  suitable punishment for those responsible for the attack, as it might well be argued that the ultimate responsibility lay with those whohad decided on warlike operations in China.The Prime Minister suggested that if the JapaneseGovernment admitted responsibility and tendered theirapologies and regrets but added that after furtherexhaustive investigations they had failed to identify the airmen who had committed the outrage,  that weshould accept as satisfactory a reply on these lines.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreedbut was emphatically opposed to Sir Robert Craigiebeing informed at present that we were prepared to makeany concession on our original demands,.    If we appearedto be weakening it would be impossible for Sir robert craigie to negotiate any satisfactory settlementsThe Lord President of the Council agreed that itwas unnecessary at this stage for the Cabinet to decide whether our Ambassador to Tokyo should be withdrawn ornot.    He hoped that a communication could be sent toSir Robert Craigie emphasising the strong feelings ofthe Cabinet on the subject.     If we them received afinal reply from the Japanese containing expressions of regret it would be possible for Sir Robert Craigieto start negotiations with a view to* getting the best possible settlement.The Prime Minister feared that if we embarked on negotiations the matter would drag on interminablyand he thought that we should endeavour to reach some decision at the earliest possible moment.   ,
The Minister for Co-ordination of defence agreed hut hoped that it would &quot;be possible to avoidanything of the nature of a ultimatum..      He would not therefore ask for a final reply by any fixed date, but would give the Japanese two or three weeks.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out that in his telegram Noo 358 of 7th.September to Sir Ro Craigie he had asked that theJapanese final reply should not be delayed for morethan a week or so.The Prime Minister thought that the position might be summed up as follows..      The Government werein no way seeking a quarrel with Japan.    On the contrarythey would like to reach an amicable settlement ofthis incident on the basis of the moderate and reason-able request already made to Japan.      It was impossibleto reach any decision until the final reply from japan was received, and in any case the Cabinet werenot prepared to decide that our Ambassador at Tokyoshould be recalled if that reply was unsatisfactorywithout further consideration.      In the meantime theSecretary of State for Poreign Affairs would examinethe alternative procedure which he (the Prime Minister)had suggested earlier in the discussion.    The PrimeMinister added that the Cabinet agreed in principle with his suggestion that some  5000 should be awardedto Sir HughsKhatchbull-Hugessen and that Sir Hugheshould be informed privately of this decision.The Secretary *f St*te for War? said that he was entirely in favour of making this gra\nt to Sir HughKnatchbull-Hugessen, but suggested that it might bedesirable for the precedents to be examined as it waspossible that the award to Sir Hugh migh* give riseto other claims.
The cabinet approved the course to he takenin regard to this question as set out in the Primeivxinister&apos;s summing up of the position given above.-9-
THE SITUATION      2.  With reference to the Conclusions on pagesIN THE PAR1 to 11 of the Draft Notes of the Meeting ofMinisters held on the 2nd September, 1937ifcdtish (CP.  208 (37)),  the Cabinet had before them asnipping inthe Far East.    Memorandum by the Secretary of State for foreign.R.^5(5])U-.    Affairs (CP.  212 (37)), copies of which were handed round at the MeetingcThe Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out that his Memorandum raised two main points.      The first point, which was discussed inparagraphs 1 to 7 of the Memorandum, related to theaction which had already been taken in regard to theverification by Japanese   v/airships of the right of aBritish ship to fly the British flag.      The second point, which was discussed in paragraphs 8 and 9 ofthe Memorandum, concerned the question of what action should be taken in the event of the Japanese takingfurther steps against British shipping other than the mere verification of their right to fly. the british flag.      With regard to the first question, we had not as yet informed the Japanese Government of our decision, for the reasons set out in the Memorandum.The view was expressed that it would be impracticable to carry out the agreed formula inparagraph 2 of CP.  212 (37) without telling theJapanese what was proposed,  and that the best line totake might be to tell the Japanese that we willtolerate verification of British registry,notwithstanding that this meant granting them a right% which they could not properly claim in thecircumstances now existing.
In this connection the Chancellor of theExchequer pointed out that at the Meeting ofMinisters on the 2nd September it had been clearly understood that we were making these concessions tothe Japanese in return for undertakings on their partthat their interference with British shipping wouldbe strictly limited in the manner proposed.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out that since the Meeting on September 2ndwe had learnt that the United States Government was strongly opposed to the Japanese being informed ofthe agreed formulaeThe Prime Minister thought that if nothing was said to the Japanese, and interference with british shipping continued, the tendency would be for theJapanese to proceed from one improper kind of interference to other and more improper kinds.He preferred, therefore, notwithstanding the Americanobjections, to inform the Japanese Government that,while we did not admit that they had any rights in thematter, we would agree to verification of Britishregistry on the terms and conditions set out in theformula.     At the same time it should be borne inmind that whatever decision was reached in the matter in regard to British shipping in Chinese Waters wouldhave to be applied to British shipping in similar circumstances in the Mediterranean.In the course of discussion the Cabinet were informed that while certain of the Governmentsadvisers were opposed to the Japanese being informed
of the formula, the First Sea Lord strongly favoured the information being given to the Japanese.      Inthis connection it was pointed out that the addendumto the formula, relating to our reservation of theright to claim compensation for damage sustained bythe owners of British ships delayed or stopped underthe procedure, would have little or no meaning if theJapanese were not informed of it.Some discussion then took place in regard tothe question of ships recently transferred to theBritish Register.      It was pointed out that in theabsence of any definition in the formula it would bevery difficult,  if not impossible, for the japanese to know where the line could be drawn between aBritish and a nonr-British ship.      The best course might be to inform the Japanese that, while we were entirely opposed to abuse of the British flag, we intended to extend the fullest protection in our power to genuine British ships;    that a British ship was a ship on the British Register;    and that theformula must be interpreted accordingly.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat he was advised that grave difficulties might beanticipated in the case of ships owned by Britishsubjects of Chinese race having dual nationality.In the case of such ships the Japanese would allegethat it was impossible without exhaustive examinationto decide whether such ships were   British or not and that this could not be done by mere verificationof the flag on the spot.-IS-
The President of the Board of Trade doubted whether there was any substance in this suggestion.A ship was either on the British Register or it wasnot, and this must be the criterion.The Prime Minister thought that the general view of the Cabinet favoured the communication ofthe formula to the Japanese Government.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs agreed, and stated that the Dominions concerned hadall agreed to the procedure proposed, and that those most interested had expressed their readiness toadopt the same procedure.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesreferred to the second paragraph on page 2 of cp. 212 (37),  and suggested that difficulties mightbe avoided if the matter could be treated on general lines in a statement of Government polisy regardingmisuse of the flag which would be applicable both tothe China Seas and the Mediterranean.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defenceobserved that our system had throughout been basedon the principle of getting as many ships as. possibleonto the British Register,      The paragraph to whichthe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries had referred needed clarification,  in that it made no reference to the important fact that a ship could onlybe placed on the British Register if the principalplace of business of the owner was in british territory.
The Prime Minister pointed out that the paragraph in question was concerned simply with thequestion of fact whether the ship was a british ship or not.      It was not concerned with the questionof possible fraudulent registration.The President of the Board of Trade informed the Cabinet that he v/ould be most strongly opposedto any suggestion that the existing rules and regulations regarding the registration of british ships should be materially altered.The Secretary of State for War pointed out that both the Japanese and General Franco objected to thevery easy procedure under which ships which were inno real sense British ships could get onto theBritish Register.      Morally there was much to be said for their complaints, and if the matter was not fully investigated and remedied it must give rise to manyembarrassing incidents.The Prime Minister thought that this aspect ofthe question could more conveniently be discussedwhen the Cabinet considered the situation in theMediterranean.
The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs warned the Cabinet that the second point discussed in paragraphs 8 and 9 of his Memorandum raisedfurther difficult questions.      He had learnt that morning that the Chinese Government were likely to appeal to the League of Nations under Article 17 ofthe Covenant.      This was the Article which dealt with cases of disputes between a Member of the League anda State which is not a Member of the League.      It was most unlikely that Japan would accept an invitation of the League to accept the obligations of Membership,fhand in that event the provisions of Article 17-of theCovenant would come automatically into operation.It had been ascertained that France and other powers were most anxious to avoid the difficult situationwhich might thus arise.      The questions discussed inthe concluding- paragraphs of his Memorandum weretechnical and difficult, and the best way to handlethem might be to refer them to a Cabinet Committeefor consideration.The Prime Minister expressed the view that itwould be a great mistake to tell the Japanese inadvance what action we proposed to take in the eventof their taking measures against British shipping ofa more drastic character than was contemplated in theformula.     As regards possible action on our part,he enquired whether consideration had bee?^. given tothe possibility of reinforcing our naval strength inthe Far East.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs&quot;thoughtthat this matter might be examined by the proposedCabinet Committee.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested, andthe Cabinet agreed,  that words such as &quot;suspected ofnot being entitled to fly the flag&quot; should be substi-tdted for the words &quot;suspected of being an impostor&quot;in lines 2 and 3 of the formula in paragraph 2 of cp.  212 (37).After further discussion, the Cabinet agreed:-(l) That the formula amended as suggestedby the Chancellor of the exchequer should be communicated to theJapanese Government.(2) That   a   Cabinet Committee composed as follows:The Home Secretary (In the Chair),The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs (or Representative),The President of the Board of Trade,The First Lord of the Admiralty,The Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence,The Attorney-General,should meet to examine the question ofthe Japanese taking further stepsagainst British shipping than the mereverification of the right of british shipping to fly the British flag andof the measures to be aolopted in suchan event.The Committee should also consider thepossible reinforcement of British naval forces in the Far East, and, should itbe thought necessary or desirable tosend such reinforcements, to advise asto the kind of reinforcements whichcould be contemplated.The Committee to hold their firstMeeting at 2, Whitehall Gardens,immediately after the conclusion ofthe adjourned Meeting of the Cabinetthat afternoon, and Ministers to beat liberty to bring to that Meetingsuch officials or advisers as theymight think fit.(3) That, in the event of the ChineseGovernment appealing to the League ofNations under Article 17 of the Covenant,the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and his colleagues at Geneva should be at liberty to deal with the matter as they thought best.FJ?, If 2 (37)3.
SITUATIONTHEnjlEERAMEAN.ge ProposedIditerraneanTerence.30^7)^.3.    With reference to the Conclusion on page 16 ofthe Notes of the Meeting of Ministers held on the2nd September, 1937, relative to the suggestion fora Meeting of Powers signatories of the SubmarineProtocol of 1936, the Cabinet had before them thefollowing memoranda circulated by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs.      Owing to shortage oftime it was not possible for these memoranda to be circulated prior to the Meeting:(1) Paper CP. 211 (37) being the record ofa Meeting held at the Foreign Office onSeptember 6th, 1937, and containingsuggestions as to the proposals to beput forward by H.M. Government at theforthcoming Mediterranean Conference(for the text of this document seeAppendix II).(2) Paper CP. 213 (37), being a memorandumby the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs containing proposals worked outby the Admiralty and the Foreign office as to the measures which H.M6 government might take in conjunction with any other powers who are willing to co-operate inputting an end to the sinking of merchant ships in the event of Italy and Germanyrefusing to attend the proposed MediterraneanConference, and it then becoming necessary to contemplate the circumstance of a smallerConference and probably also the modificationof the type of proposals to which theConference, as thus restricted, might beexpected to agree.     (For the text of thisMemorandum see Appendix III).
The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that there had been a somewhatacrimonious controversy with the French Government onthe subject of the Powers to be invited to the suggest-ed Mediterranean Conference.    In the first instance theFrench Government had suggested that the ValenciaGovernment should be invited but not the ItalianGovernment.     He (the Secretary of State) had argued that neither of the two Spanish Governments should be present at the Conference which should be attended bythe Mediterranean Powers, including of course, Italy.Ultimately the French Government agreed that theValencia Government should be excluded;    that theItalian Government should be invited, but that theSoviet Government, which had had ships sunk in theMediterranean, should also &quot;be invited.     He had donehis utmost to diemsade M. Delbos to modify his demand that the Soviet Government should attend the Conferenceand had pointed out that if Russia was included,Germany would also have to be included.     M^. Delboshad stated that the matter had been considered by theFrench Cabinet and that if we insisted on the exclusion of Soviet Russia, the position would become extremelygrave and S&amp;a&amp;Ga^hejrself would Txa^mafele to -a%t^nd 1116&quot;G^a&amp;erence.     In these circumstances he had felt boundto acquiesce in an invitation being sent to SovietRussia,/,    The Secretary of State pointed out that although his discussions with M. Delbos had takenplace on the telephone there has been no leakage of(\ any kind, and it was of very great importance thatthere should be no disclosure of these differences between the two Governments.
The Secretary of State then informed the cabinet as to conversations he had had with the French andItalian Charge d&apos;Affaires in London.     He had impressed upon the latter the very great importance of Italybeing present at the Nyon Conference.    While the ItalianCharge dfAffaires appreciated the arguments used, he had indicated that the Italian Government was apprehensive thatif they went to Nyon, Soviet Russia would take theopportunity of repeating the accusations about the sinking of Russian ships by Italian submarines.    He(the Secretary of State) had argued that by refusing togo to Nyon Italy would be merely playing the Russiangame.    The Charge  affaires had then enquired whetherif Italy went to Nyon we would give an undertaking that russia would make no reference to past events.    He (theSecretary of State) had pointed out that it was quite impossible for him to give any such undertaking, butthat it was our earnest hope that the Conference wouldconcern itself with the future and not with the past,and that we should do everything in our power to thisend.     H. M. Ambassador in Rome had expressed the viewthat ultimately Italy was likely to attend theConference.informed him that the French.Government rogarde&amp;- theConference as being mainly concerned with technical matters.    He had then proceeded to indicate the attitudeof French Ministers towards non-intervention.     M. Blumfavoured the continuance of non-intervention and thoughtthat another attempt should be made to persuade bothsides in Spain to withdraw volunteers.    The FrenchGovernment were very much concerned at the presence ofM. Cambon, the French Charge d!Affaires. had
four senior Italian Generals with General Franco!forces.      With regard to Abyssinia, M.  Chautemps was favourable to a clearing up of the position, but took a pessimistic view of any progress being made whilethe Mediterranean difficulties continued.^ If the A^^tiL,Nyon Conference proved successful the present attitudeof the French Government towards the Abyssinianproblem might change.The Secretary of State added that up to thepresent no reply to the invitation to attend the NyonConference had been received from the Italian andGerman Governments.      It might be expected that those governments would act together in the matter.The Secretary of State then briefly explained to the Cabinet the scope of his two memoranda(CP.   211 (37) and CP,  213 (37)).      CP.  211 (37)was based on the assumption that Italy would be present at the Conference and contained suggestions as to the line to be taken with the two SpanishGovernments and the measures to be taken &quot;by the Powersthemselves.     An agreement on the basis of theproposals contained in Co P.  211 (37) would be highlysatisfactory.The suggestion was made that even if Italy wasnot present at the Conference it would be possible toinform her of the conclusions reached by the Powersparticipating in the Conference with a view to heracceptance of these conclusions.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs agreed,  and thought that in this event Italy might be approached through the diplomatic channel.     This,however, should be done before the Conference had
reached any final conclusions,  as otherwise italy would complain that she was being presented with a fait,    acconvplioThe Prime Minister suggested that it might he found possible to inform Italy in advance of theConference of what was proposed,    He was very anxiousindeed to avoid a situation in which the Great Powersbecame grouped into blocsPThe Secretary of State for Poreign affairs explained that while the Admiralty could not guarantee that the proposals contained in CoPo  213(37) would work smoothly and satisfactorily there was little doubt that in practice this would be so.The Prime Minister drew attention to the suggest-ion on page 3 of C.P0  213 (37) that :&quot;The Russian Navy might at the same time be asked if they were prepared to .watch any area in the Aegean&quot;.He thought that this was a very dubious proposal.Attention was also drawn to other references tothe possibility of Russian naval ships operating inthe Mediterranean.It was pointed out that it might be difficult to insist on the exclusion of Russian naval ships fromthe Mediterranean having regard to the numerous attacksthat had been made on Russian merchant ships in thosewaters.    While there^would be no objection to naval vessels belonging to 5*a^s and Yugo Slavia participat-ing in the arrangements, it was recognised that inpractice such participation * aid &quot;be unlikely to serveany useful purpose^General agreement was expressed with the view ofthe Prime Minister that the proposal that Russian navalships should participate in the arrangements was opento serious objection which would be mitigated, to someextent, if Powers like Turkey and Yugo Slavia,-21-
participated in the scheme.The Prime Minister then drew attention to (iii)on page 4 of CP. 213 (37):-(iii) This instruction extends to anysubmarine in the vicinity of aposition in which a merchant ship has recently been attackedor sunk.General agreement was expressed of the view thatthis went too far, as it would cover the sinking ofaiinnocent submarine which might by chance have beenin the vicinity of the attacked merchant ship but which had had nothing to do with the incident.      Itwas pointed out that the proposals on page 4 of cp. 213 (37) were not in final form and were in anycase for the information of Ministers only.      It wassuggested that there might be added to (iii) something to the effect that if the submarine remains submergedthis will be taken as prima facie evidence that shewas responsible for the incident.      In reply to enquiries, it was pointed out that the proposals now-under consideration covered the scheme for theverification of the flsg (see, for example, paragraphson pages 1 and 2 of CP. 211 (37) under heading&quot;Verification of Flag&quot;).In this connection, the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs observed that it was possible that difficulties in regard to this matter might be raisedby New Zealand and by the Irish Free State.      TheIrish Free State have ships trading to the Mediterraneanwhich fly the Irish Free State flag.     He would like a few days in which to clear up the position in regardto these Dominions.Attention was drawn to the wording of (iv) onpage 4 of CP. 213 (37), and it was agreed that the
wording of this passage should be amended to read:-(iv) The above instruction shall remain in force until changed,but will be reviewed monthly.The Cabinet agreed:-Subject to the amendments andalterations raised in the discussion and noted above, to approve theproposals contained in PapersCP.  211 (37) and CP.  213 (37)respectively as the proposals to beput forward by His Majesty&apos;s government at the forthcoming MediterraneanConference to be held at Nyon.
ION OPKSFEREIGNTO THEHICR,4.   The Prime Minister thought that General Francohad a legitimate grievance if merchant ships belongingto the Valencia Government could by a technicaldevice get themselves transferred to the BritishRegister and so become entitled to British naval protection.      The recent cases of the S.S. Woodfordand the S.S. Burlington were cases in point.      he fully agreed that there could be no question of such ships being generally struck off the British Register.Still less was he prepared to summon Parliament forthe passage of len;i slat ion to amend the existing law.Had the Board of Trade considered the matter, and if so with what result?The President of the Board of Trade doubted whether the particular ships which had been^referred..to were really very good examplesp^   These two sh^Tps,*x**c*-had recently been transferred from the Greek to theBritish flag, and had by so doing merely transferredthemselves from the flag of.a country which.could not,to a flag of a country which could protect trr&amp;fa^^   Hewas much relieved to hear that no change of the law relating to Registration was contemplated.      Twosteps had in fact been taken.      (l) The arrangements under which provisional registration could be granted by Consular Officers abroad had been terminatod, andall applications must now be considered, in London.Under this new procedure dubious applications couldbe hung up, and this no doubt swat^-d as a powerfuldeterrent.      (2) There were a few cases in which itwas doubtful whether the conditions of registrationhad in fact been complied with, and if on investigationthis was established the ships would be removed from
the Register. .    It should he noted that yH^ntJ^rqu-ito a noa^ey -of tonic us &quot;had been rumeved from theBritish Register^ and this-wae a serious matter aswe had no big reserves of this kind of tonnage.The First Lord of the Admiralty doubted whetherthe argument based on general policy had much forcein the case of ships of the kind in question.     such ships never came to British ports, and in the eventof war they would leave the Register.The President of the Board of Trade reminded theCabinet that in 1914 one of our first steps had been to pass legislation preventing ships from leaving theBritish Register.      He undertook to examine asuggestion that ships now in possession of &quot;provisionalcertificates&quot; should be instructed by our naval vessels to proceed to a British port, to have theircertificates verified and if satisfactory to have themmade permanent.

The Cabinet agreed that the representatives at the forthcoming Nyon Conference should he theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the first sea Lord of the Admiralty, and the Permanent UnderSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
ORTHCOMINGING OP THE[SLY OP THEB OPH3 ATA.6. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thathe had invited the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs to go to Geneva to assist the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, particularly in regardto matters such as consultation with the DominionDelegates at the Assembly.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs said that he had accepted the Prime Minister&apos;invitation, but would be unable to be at Genevabefore Monday, September 13th, as he would beMinister in attendance at Balmoral from September8th to September 11th.
THE SITUATION     7.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by in SPAIN.the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(CP. 207 (37)) proposing an exchange of Agents withRelations withSalamanca the Salamanca Government.      The proposal was thatGovernment.we should inform General Franco that we wereEfc-kO(yj)?&apos; prepared to accept an Agent of his in London in exhange for the establishment of a British Agentat Salamanca.      In making this communication it wouldbe explained that such an arrangement would not inour eyes constitute formal recognition ofGeneral Franco&apos;s Government, and that we should not therefore grant, or expect to receive, fulldiplomatic status for the Agents.      They would,however,  of course, have the right of confidentialcommunication, and General Franco&apos;s Agent in london would have free access to the Foreign Office.      Theproposal would also include an exchange of consularAgents in ports and other towns where necessary.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that he was in favour of theseproposals and would like to take the opportunity of settling at the same time certain points outstandingwith the Salamanca Government,  including theretention by that Government of certain British ships.He suggested that if it was found possible toreach agreement at the Nyon Conference,  this would bea good moment at which to open the question withGeneral Franco.      He proposed,  therefore, to act
in about ten days&apos;  time.      While no doubt theproposals would be criticised in certain quarters,,there was no doubt that, for the reasons given inthe penultimate paragraph of CP. 207 (37), thebalance of advantage was strongly in favour of proceeding with them.The Cabinet agreed:To approve the proposals of theSecretary of State for PoreignA:?fairs for an exchange ofAgents with the SalamancaGovernment, as suggested in cp,  207 (37), and to take note that the Secretary of state proposed to open discussions onthe subject with General Francoin about ten days&apos;  time.
ABYSSINIANNATION.he Tresentase inJlo-ItalianEations andhe  fteti on7 the FinalfcognitionlltalianiereigntyfAbyssinia.teviousiference:fbinet   6336) Con-conclusion 3. )Or8o      The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP,  210 (37))on the present phase in Anglo-Italian relations and thequestion of the final recognition of Italian sovereignty in Abyssinia0      In the historical introduction to his memorandum,  the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs recalled the more important developments in Anglo-Italian relations since the signature on the 2nd Januarylast of the joint declaration.      The Memorandum thendiscussed certain general considerations,  including thepolitical and other arguments for and against de jure recognition of Italy&apos;s sovereignty over Abyssinia, andemphasized the importance,  if such formal recognitionwas to be accorded, of this being presented as a contri-bution to the general pacification and appeasement ofEurope and not as a nefarious bargain by which Italygained our assent to her wrong doing in return formaterial advantages to ourselves.      The Memorandumconcluded with the Secretary of State&apos;s suggestion thatthe United Kingdom Delegation at Geneva should be given a certain latitude in the situation;    the objectives forwhich we should work should be to bring a succesful issue to the conference of the Mediterranean Powers, toendeavour to make of such an issue the occasion for a real detente between Italy and France if this could besecured, when the co-operation of France and other powers in finally resolving the Abyssinian problem should be forthcoming, and, together, we should be able to take afurther step towards the final liquidation of the abyssinian deadlock.In two Annexes of his Memorandum the Secretary ofState discussed (I) the procedure at the forthcoming meeting of the Assembly of the League of Nations and (II)the objectives of Anglo-Italian conversations.
The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs explained that the somewhat inconclusive characterof his Memorandum was due to the great uncertainty of the present political situationo      From suchenquiries as he had been able to make he was convinced that if we could reach a satisfactoryprotection of shipping in the Mediterranean, therewas a reasonable chance of obtaining a satisfactory solution such as his Memorandum envisaged.      On theother hand,  if the Nyon Conference failed,^the&apos;5chances of a successful settlement of the Abyssinianproblem in the near future would be very small.If Abyssinia attended the forthcoming Meetingof the Assembly of the League there would be little or no difficulty, because the Credentials Committeewould no doubt find that the Abyssinian Delegationcould have no claim to represent Abyssinia in present ircumstance a. .   ,The^.di flenity-would-arise.- in an acute form if an Abyssinian Delegation was not present at the Meeting of the Assembly.The Lord President of the Council said that hehad been much struck by recent telegrams fromMr.  Ingram at Rome, and particularly by what was said in telegrams 479 and 480 of September 6th in regardto the views and wishes of Count Ciano.      In all thecircumstances, might it not be useful to instructMr.  Ingram to have a friendly talk with Count Cianoand to tell him that we had given very full and careful consideration to what was to happen at thearrangement^at the Nyon Conference about the
forthcoming Meeting of the Assembly, pointing outthat while there would be no difficulty if Abyssiniaattended, we foresaw serious difficulty if anAbyssinian Delegation was absent?      Mr.  Ingram mightpoint out that there was nothing to be gained, from italy&apos;s point of view, by more acrimonious discussions,and he could frankly expound and explain our difficulties.The Prime Minister did not think that the cabinet had as yet had an opportunity of fully discussing thequestion of Anglo-Italian relations.      He had beeninformed that the interchange of letters betweenSignor Mussolini and himself had created a very deepimpression of rejoicing and relief throughout Italy.Signor Mussolini himself had been much pleased andgratified.     &amp;w4rHfeg--tGH-Pta3^^suddenlydeteriorated.      The Home Secretary&apos;s visit to Cyprus had excited grave misgivings, and italy had thought fit strongly to reinforce her Libyan Army.She was apparently convinced that we would act as sheherself would have done, and that we were harbouringa vendetta against her.      He (the Prime Minister)had been very anxious lest the good effect of theexchange of messages with Signor Mussolini should fadeaway, as Mr.  Ingram&apos;s telegrams seemed to fear.He also had very much in mind the views of theChiefs of Staff summarised in paragraphs 3 and 4 of cp.  S10 (37).      He had regarded the lessening of the tension between this country and Italy as a very
valuable contribution towards the pacification andappeasement of Europe0     A return to normal friendly-relations between ourselves and Italy would undoubtedlyweaken the Rome-Berlin axis and it might be anticipatedthat in the event of a dispute betv/een ourselves andGermany the attitude of Italy would be very different from what it: would be at presentBHe had hoped that at the Meeting of the assembly at Geneva we should have been able to take the first step towards the de ,jure recognition of Italiansovereignty over Abyssinia.      That step would havebeen a finding by the Assembly that Abyssinia was nolonger a Sovereign State.      It would then have beenopen to the individual Members of the Assembly to take their own line on the question of recognising Italiansovereignty over Abyssinia.      No doubt serious objectionwould be raised by extreme supporters of the League,but in this matter we must &quot;oe realistic and face thefacts.      As he had said to Count Grand!, de jure recognition could only be justified if it formed partof a general appeasement.      He had hoped that it wouldhave been found possible, with the assistance andco-operation of Prance, to get the subject disposed ofat Geneva.      The whole situation had, however, been changed by the activities of the Italian submarines inthe Mediterranean and by Signbr Mussolini&apos;s foolishboasting in connection with General Franco&apos;s capture ofSantander,      In the result,  the French Government werenot now prepared to co-operate, and he (the PrimeMinister) thought that it was out of the question for
us to proceed in the matter without france s co-operation.If we wanted to maintain a good atmosphere we must notlet the Italians think that the proposed Anglft-Italian Conversations were dead.      It might be possible to say that, we had hoped to raise thisquestion of Ae-yttgo-ipoooghitioa at Geneva, but that recent events in the Mediterranean and in Spain had made the position very unfavourable, and the best solution in the circumstances would be to endeavourto reach a full and satisfactory agreement at theNyon Conference.      The Italians might reply that ifwe got a satisfactory agreement at Nyon, would webe prepared to guarantee that Italian desideratawould be forthcoming at Geneva?     We could answer that while we could not possibly guarantee what would happen at Geneva, we ourselves would do our best to clear up the position, possibly at a Special Meetingof the League called for the purpose.     He (thePrime Minister) knew that the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs found difficulty in going quite sofar as he (the Prime Minister) would like to go, buthe hoped that we should be able to do everything wepossibly could to recover the better atmosphere ofthe early summer.
The Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs read to the Cabinet telegram No, 281 of 7th. Septemberwhich he had sent to Mr0  Ingram.    (For the text of this telegram see Appendix IV) r.The Secretary of State pointed out that this telegram made no specific reference to Abyssinia.      Hewas apprehensive of mating any such direct reference, asif we did so Italy would at once publish to the world that we were ready to deal with her on the subject -and any language we used would certainly misrepresentour true views and gravely embarrass us.      There wasno doubt that Signor Mussolini would very much like tohave received some assurance in regard to Abyssiniabefore his visit to Germany.The President of the Board of Trade thought thatif the atmosphere was to be improved it was imperative that Count Ciano should receive some answer to his enquiries.    He hoped that it would not be necessary tobreak off our relations with Italy on what was littlemore than a matter of procedure^The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs expressed the view that even if our relations with italy could be much improved it would make very little,if any,  difference to our military preparations.Italy was unstable and untrustworthy,      ^GeneralBlomberg had expressed the opinion that in  a futurewar Italy would be found on the opposite side   to &quot;^lieone which she had solemnly engaged hei*selfto fight with.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairsfavoured something more being said to Italy on thelines of the Prime Ministers remarks than was
contained in telegram No. 281 of September 7th.      Atthe same time it was very important to avoid giving anyguarantee which we should find ourselves subsequentlyunable to implement.    If we took the initiative   atGeneva in circumstances where other States were not inagreement with us the position would be very difficult and we might well be faced with the dangerous situation of being opposed there by one or two of the DominionDelegations.      He much hoped, therefore? that any statement would be carefully qualified and that, inparticular, we would give no guarantees.    It might, thenbe possible to persuade New Zealand^to accept a success-issueful/of the Nyon Conference as justification for de jure recognition of Italy&apos;s position in Abyssinia.The Prime Minister urged that the opportunity should not be lost.      We must try and convince theItalians that we were frank and holding nothing back from them.      He himself would not mind explaining tothem that the difficulties at Geneva were not difficul-ties raised by us but &quot;by others which we should verymuch like to overcome and which they (the Italians)must help us to overcome.The Chancellor of the Exchequer s&quot;^id that it was recognised that if we were to have a betted under-standing with Italy we must get acceptance o -.^e facts\of the Abyssinian position.      Would it be possibi3^ ^0say to Italy that if we could reach a full agreement on Nyon we should propose to pursue the July conver-nations, but that we recognised that a full understandingwould have to include a number of important questionsof which de ,jure recognition of the Abyssinian position was one?.
The Secretary of State for Poreign affairs referred to S^gnfarH(hi&amp;s^4^i^s- oheervation that noquestion now arose as regards the Mediterranean, andthat the only important question between us was the abyssinian one.      Assuming Signor Mussolini continuedhis present policy in the Mediterranean and as a result the Nyon Conference failed, was it still suggested thatour policy should be to turn Abyssinia out of theLeague?The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence thoughtthat the answer must be in the affirmative, but thatthe implementing of that policy had become impossible.The Prime Minister emphasised that the important thing-was to strive for a change of heart and attitude on the part of Italy.      Was this too much to hope for?The Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs had thoughtthat an improvement in our relations with Italy wouldnot mean that our defence preparations could be reduced.He (the Prime Minister) thought that in time they couldbe reduced, but he agreed that this could not be donerapidly.The Home Secretary observed that we had done verylittle in regard to rearmament in the Mediterranean.The Cabinet sooner or later must choose between the re-establishment of friendly relations with Italy andsubstantially heavier rearmament in the Mediterranean,He also would like to see an advance on the position asset out in telegram Noo  281 to Mr,  Ingram of 7th.September.NOTE.    The Cabinet adjourned at 1.30 p.m,and resumed at 2.45 p*m.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat he had had an opportunity of discussing with his advisers the formula suggested before the adjournmentby the Chancellor of the Exchequer.      It was clearthat if we said anything to Count Ciano aboutAbyssinia we should have to be very careful indeed in our wording, as otherwise we should be subject tothe most embarrassing misinterpretations.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that his suggestion had been to the following effect:   we might say, with reference to the Nyon Conference, that we hoped very much indeed that the Italians would be &apos;present, and that the Conference would result in anagreement which would enable the two countries toco-operate together in confidence and friendship, andwould also enable us to carry further the understanding which the Prime Minister and Signor Mussolini had worked for in July last.     Within the range of theproposed discussions there were a large number of questions, and we did not propose to exclude from thediscussions those specifically mentioned by count ciano.The President of the Board of Trade suggested thatwe might add a reference to the great difficulty of raising this particular Abyssinian matter at Geneva.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thoughtthat the Italians were well aware of our attitude, andfor his part he would be content to leave the matter as in his telegram to Mr.  Ingram of the 8th September.If, iiowever, the Cabinet would like to go further hewould assent.The First Lord of the Admiralty suggested that if
we could avoid the words &quot;de jure&quot; it would makea difference.The Prime Minister observed that from theItalian point of view &quot;de jure&quot; recognition meant that the Abyssinians would no longer be able to loo-cto us to reverse the present position in Abyssinia.The Lord President of the Council thought thatthe expression &quot;de jure&quot; carried with it a note of moral justification.      Our attitude should rather bethat, while we did not withdraw in any particularanything that we had said or done in the past, were recognised the inescapable fact that Italy was nowin sovereign control of Abyssinia.     He himself was quite content to leave the matter to the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, but he would have liked him,if it was possible, to go somewhat further than theChancellor of the Exchequer, and to make use in -argument of selections from Myi-fe^ramTo rooontThe Secretary of State for India wished that hecould feel that if we were frank and open with Italy,Italy would be equally frank and open with us.      Inthis connection he referred to the recent telegramstating on good authority that large numbers of italian volunteers were proceeding to Spain by way ofSardinia and Africa.     So long as Signor Mussoliniindulged in activities of this kind, he (Lord Zetland)doubted whether any discussions could be of much value.In the course of discussion, the view wiasexpressed by the Secretary of State for Scotland thatthere was considerable risk in going further in thismatter than the Secretary of State&apos;s telegram to
Mr. Ingram.      The Italians might very well gain theimpression that we were running after them, whereasof course the fact was that the approach in regardto our attitude to the Abyssinian problem had beenmade by Count Ciano himself.The First Lord of the Admiralty observed thatour foreign policy must be based on the state of ourarmaments.     We were not in a position to fightItaly, Germany and Japan at the same time, and it was for this and other reasons that he attached thegreatest importance to convincing Signor Mussolinithat we wished to be friends with him.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thoughtthat our line might be that we stood by everything that the Prime Minister had said to Count Grandi andto Signor Mussolini, but the events which had takenplace in the interval had made the position very muchmore difficult, and that was why we attached so much importance to achieving success at the Nyon Conference.This wording met with general acceptance*The Cabinet agreed:-(1) To request the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to draft afurther telegram to His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Rome on the general lines mentioned in the course ofthe discussion.(2) That the im ufL telegram should be circulated W the-Membero of tho-Cabinet later in the day,

The Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum(CP. 209 (37)) by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs covering a draft of the portion of the speech(dealing with the general economic situation and withthe Report of the Committee for the Study of theProblem of Raw Materials) which he proposed to makeat the Assembly of the League of Nations probably onthe 14th or 15th of September.      This draft had beenprepared after Inter-departmental consultation withthe Treasury, Board of Trade, Colonial Office and dominions Office, and in his Memorandum the Secretaryof State drew special attention to paragraphs 21 to26 which embodied the proposal to withdraw preferencesat present granted to imports from the United kingdom by certain Tropical African Dependencies.      the paragraphs in question were placed in brackets as thequestion had not yet been before the Cabinet, nor hadMinisters had an opportunity of giving their finalconsidered views upon it.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that since his Memorandum hadbeen drafted, circumstances had arisen which hadnecessitated its amendment in certain important respects.      Sir Frederick Leith Ross had pressed fora strong indictment of Germany for her re-armamentactivities.     After some discussion the paragraphsrelating to this had been much toned down.     among other things there had been the speech of Herr Hitler,and he (the Secretary of State) was anxious that thereshould be no suggestion that his speech had beenprepared as a reply to that delivered by Herr Hitler.
The Report of the Raw Materials Committee had now been published, and had shown that the Colonialaspect of the whole question was of infinitesimalconsequence.      There was now therefore no object inmaking a gesture as regards the &quot;open door&apos; and he proposed to cut out paragraphs 21 to 26 of his speech.He would like, however,  to retain paragraph 20.     TheSecretary of State referred to a draft paragraphwhich had been prepared dealing with complaints aboutdifficulty of access to the united Kingdom market.The President of the Board of Trade said that hehad no objection to the substance of the draft paragraph,but he would like the wording altered.The suggestion was made that paragraphs 29 to 34might be very much condensed and made much lessprovocativeo      It might indeed be best to omit themand to rely only on paragraph 35*      Certain other amendments were suggested.After a brief discussion, the Cabinet agreed:-(l) To take note that the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs proposedto redraft his speech to the Assemblyof the League of Nations on the lines indicated by him.(2) That Members of the Cabinet should send to the Secretary of State their suggestions, but that it should beleft to the Secretary of State to embody the suggested amendmends and alterations as he might think fit.(3) That subject to (l) and (2) abovethe draft Speech should be approved.

Knatchbull-Hugessen waswounded.The Japanese Government on receiving news of the eventin question took a grave view of the incident and hastenedto convey expressions of profound sympathy to HisBritannic Majesty&apos;s Government and to Sir Ho Knatchbull-Hugessen through myself and the Ambassadors to the Courtof St. James&apos;s and to China respectively and at the sametime they sent urgent instructions to the authorities on the spot to investigate the case thoroughly.   Althoughresults of these investigations have so far failed toproduce any evidence to establish that the shooting was done by a Japanese aeroplane the Japanese Government aretaking measures for further investigations by theauthorities on the spot in order to spare no efforts toascertain the facts of the case.In these circumstances it is still impossible to

Nevertheless in view of traditionalties of friendship which hinds Japan and Great BritainJapanese Government express their profound regret that sir Ho Knatchbull-Hugossen should have met with sucha misfortune incident       to hostilities that were actually in progress in the region of Taitsang on that particular day.2.      In this connexion I wish to assure Your Excellencythat Japanese forces always take fullest precautionagainst causing injuries to non-combatants and it iscertainly very far from the desire of the JapaneseGovernment that such an unfortunate event should everoccur in the future through any fault of their own.Fresh instructions have consequently been sent to theirauthorities on the spot to exercise the strictest cautionin this regard.

APPENDIX II.PROPOSED MEDITERRANEAN CONFERENCE.RECORD OF A MEETING HELD ON 6TH SEPTEMBER.  1937.A meeting was held on 6th September in Sir 11, Vansittarfsroom to discuss the proposals to he put forward &quot;by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment at the forthcoming Mediterranean Conference.The meeting considered the tentative proposals communicated by the Secretary of State to the French Government on 3rd September,particulars of which are given in the attached despatch to Mr.Lloyd Thomas together with the comments of the Blench GovernmentthereonoRear-Admiral Cunningham explained that the views which he wasabout to put forward on behalf of the Admiralty had not yet been referred to the Chief of the Naval Staff and must he understood torepresent the provisional conclusions reached hy the Admiralty andsubject to the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Stations&apos;concurrence..Verification of Flag.Admiral Cunningham explained that the Italian Government would,most probably,  argue at the Conference that the action of submarinesto which exception was now taken had been forced on the Spanishparties owing to the refusal of other countries to accord thembelligerent rights.      It would be essential to meet this argumentand the simplest solution would, of course, be to accord belligerentrights.      If, however,  as he supposed,  such a solution was politically impossible,  the argument would be to some extent met if we proposedthat the same rights should now be granted to the warships of both parties in Spain as we proposed to grant to Japan, i.e. that we^should raise no objection to the Spanish parties verifying the
right of a ship to fly the British flag, provided that after verification-fication the ship is allowed to proceed, and provided also that ifa British warship is present she shall undertake,  on request, theduty of verification.It was agreed that His Majesty!s Government should resist any attempt to introduce the subject of belligerent rights atthe Conference but that if the above mentioned argument were raised, the Cabinet should be recommended to agree to a proposal in the above sense.Scope of proposed defensive measures.The proposal made to the French Government last week wasthat defensive measures should be limited to attacks by submarines.The French Government proposed that these measures should coverattacks by surface vessels and aircraft as well as submarine and the laying of mines.It was agreed that the proposal should be resisted and thatthe discussions should be limited at any rate in the firstinstance to attacks by submarines.      This could be defended on theground (l) that it was the abuse of international law by sub-marines which had given rise to the present situation, and not byother arms, and that submarines rather than surface vessels or aircraft had caused most of the damage to merchant shipping, and(2) that aircraft, which operate both on land and at sea must betreated differently from submarines.It was, however, agreed that provided agreement could first be reached in regard to submarines, we should raise no objection
to a discussion, at a subsequent meeting, of the other pointsuientioned by the French.      In view of the refusal of the french in the past to agree to the differantiation of submarines and surface vessels from the point of view of the risks to merchantshipping,  it seems that a good deal of opposition is to beexpected from the French on this point and it was recommenced thatthe earliest possible opportunity should be used to induce theFrench Government to come into line.A further reason for limiting the Discussion;sion to submarineslies in the fact that if no international agreement is reached at the proposed conference;   the counter measures which it isproposed that this country shall adopt against attacks on merchantshipping can,  if restricted to submarines, be undertaken with farless risk of hostilities with Italy than if they were extended tosurface vessels and aircraft.      It is obvious that so long as theattacker is a submarine the risk of its identity being establishedis comparatively smallsjyteasures to be undertaken by the two parties in Spain.It was agreed that since the risks to shipping would continueif submarines were allowed to operate on the surface it would benecessary to ensure that they should not operate either submergedor on the surface and that communication in this sense should bemade to the two parties in-Spain.      The Admiralty representativeproposed that the two parties should be informed that theirsubmarines must be confined to port and should not be moved without prior notification to the Powers concerned.      Failure to carry out
these measures, would, render the submarines liable to besunk.     Objection was raised to the sinking of submarinesinside Spanish territorial waters and it was agreed that itmight be necessary to amend the proposal in the sense thatthey should be allowed freedom of action inside territorial waters.Proposed general prohibition, of the use of submarines.The preceding proposal can be justified on the groundthat the conduct of the two parties in Spain in resorting topiracy has caused them to forfeit the rights normallyenjoyed by independent States,  and that therefore they mustsubmit to a restriction upon the movements of theirsubmarines.      Since the high seas are free to all warshipsit is possible that a warship belonging to a participatingPower might in error sink a submarine belonging to a friendlyPower if found in the Mediterranean.      The Admiraltytherefore propose that the whole of the Mediterranean Seashall be closed to all submarines of whatever nationalitywith the exception of limited areas necessary for exercisesoff the naval port of the Powers concerned.      Such areas would for instance in the case pf Italy include the whole ofthe Adriatic Sea and a specified area round such ports asSpezia.All merchant ships would be notified of the above-areas and would be instructed to keep outside them.      Theuse of submarines in territorial waters should also be prohibited.      This point, however, was not considered to beof primary importance and it was agreed that if necessaryterritorial waters might be exempted.      In order to forestalldemands to move submarines from one international port to
another,  it was agreed that each Power should have theright to do so, subject to prior notification to the othercountries and to the submarine or submarines proceeding onthe surface and accompanied by surface vessels.It was agreed to recommend that the proposal to denythe use of the Mediterranean to the submarines of Powersother than Spain would follow logically upon a similarprohibition In respect of Spanish submarines and not vice versa as suggested by the French Government,Abusof Flag, and cnange of nationality.French Government proposed that measures should beconsidered for preventing abuse of the flag and change ofthe nationality of shipping,      It was agreed that this wasa question for the Board of Trade, but that it would seemto be covered by the right of verification which it isproposed shall be accorded to the two parties in Spain.Organisation of pr^-y-entlve measures.French Government propose that these measures shall be organised on a collective basis and involve mutual assistance against attacks.      The Admiralty representativeurged most strongly that there should be no division intonational areas, the warships of each Power remaining free to operate throughout the Mediterranean and retaining the rightindividually to sink any submarine found.      Any attempt to divide the Mediterranean into zones to be patrolledindividually by the warships of each of the Powers concerned would defeat the object of the proposal.      If such zones were adopted, the Italian Government, having selected a particular area, would be free to continue sinking ships inside that
area, at the same time protesting that they were doing their best to prevent such occurrences.Accession of Powers not attending the Conference.It was agreed that the question of inviting other powers in addition to those already invited to attend theConference would be loft open, but that in any case accession to any agreement reached at the Conference should be open toall.      In the event of the submarine of a non-participatingPower wishing to enter the Mediterranean,  it was proposedthat that Power should give prior notification to the participating Powers of the proposed visit.Duration of proposed agreement.It was agreed that provided that agreement could bereached on the proposals set out above,  the question of the duration of any agreement in which they might be incorporatedwas one of minor importance.     At the same time, the meeting was in favour of a provision being included of this nature and it was suggested that a preliminary period of threemonths might be selected or alternatively that no definite period should be laid down, but that the agreement should besubject to revision at one month&apos;s notice.Action in the event&apos;of no. agreement being reached.Admiral Cunningham suggested that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should announce, in the event of failure to reach agreement, that our warships would be instructed to hunt anysubmarines which had attacked any merchant ship. The aboveaction would be more limited, in extent, than the steps whichit is proposed that the Powers should take by agreement, but which it would be very difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Government
to enforce alone or at most with the co-operation of theFrench Government.      The action proposed above would hesimilar to that which the Commander-in-Chief of theMediterranean Fleet has already received orders to carryout in accordance with the recent announcements hut it?/ould cover attacks on foreign as well as British merchant ships.      Such action would he justified on the ground thatit was the duty of each naval Power to put down piracy no matter whether the attacks are against its own ships or those of another Power.Foreign Office,6th September,  1937.
ANNEXForeign Office, S.W.1.3rd Septembers  1937,3ir9The French Charge d&apos;Affaires came to see me this afternoonwhen he began by saying that he had spoken to Mo Delbos on the telephone on the subject of the list of countries to whom invitationswere to be addressed for the Mediterranean Conference at Geneva.If the Valencia Government were not to be invited9 Mo Delbos insisted that the Black Sea Powers should be invited.      I  replied that Ireally did not like this extension of the list of invitations;    I felt sure that in the first instance the list should be limitedstrictly to the Mediterranean Powers who were those most intimatelyconcerned, and who were alone those able to take action to meet thesituation - i.e. Great Britain., France. Italy. Yugoslavia., Albania9Greece9 Turkey and Egypt.2o I then explained to Mo Cambon the proposals that we had inmind.     At the Geneva meeting we should do our best to secure agree-ment for a joint approach to the two parties in Spain in which weshould tell them that  since the use of the submarine in the presentcivil war had resulted in the grossest abuse and flagrant breaches ofinternational law9 we must request the two parties in Spain to take steps to ensure that their submarines did not operate submergedoutside their own territorial waters.     If they did so they would&quot;be liable to be sunk.3. Second.,  the neutral Mediterranean Powers should enter into an understanding between themselves for a self-denying ordinance? by its terms these Powers would agree that their submarines would notJtfHo Lloyd Thomas, Esq.&amp;Co9   &amp;Cos   &amp;C.british Embassy9 Paris.
be submerged outside certain fixed limits which at no point wouldprobably exceed 10 miles from the coast.      It followed from this that,  if a submarine were found submerged   outside these clearlyI  defined limits9  it would be liable to be sunk.     These proposalsmights  in the first instances be put into force for three months5with power to extend the period if desired.4. M. Cambon said that he himself liked the proposalss which seemed to be essentially practical and technical!    they would avoid a lot of political controversy which would lead nowhere.     He would submit them to his Government to-night and let me have their responsehe hoped   to-morrow.     I explained that we desired to issue the invitations with the least possible delay?    I thought that theyshould go out in our joint names3  if possible to-morrow9  and thatthe invitations should be to discuss the security of shipping in theMediterraneans  or some such general phrase.     This also M. Cambonsaid that he would submit.I ams &amp;c.(signed) ANTHONY EDEN.
APPENDIX    III.CABINEToSituation   in   the   Mediterranean.,Memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,,It is possible that as a result of the recent Soviet Noteaddressed to Italy? the Italian Government will refuse to attend the proposed Mediterranean Conference.      This will entail the refusal of Germany, and probably also the modification of the typeof proposals to which the Conference,  thus restricted, could beexpected to agree.      It is necessary, therefore,  to contemplate the circumstance of a smaller conference which Italy and germany would not attend and to examine the measures which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment could then take in conjunction with any other Powerswho were willing to co-operate in putting an end to the sinking of merchant shipsoProposals had been worked out by the Admiralty and theForeign Office under which the two parties in Spain should beinformed that their submarines must in future be confined to port,and that failure to carry out this measure would render them liableto be sunko     As a logical consequence of this restriction upon the movements of Spanish submarines, and in view of the possibilityof non-Spanish submarines being sunk in error, it was furtherproposed that the whole of the Mediterranean should be closed toall submarines, with the exception of certain limited areas deemed necessary for exercises off the naval ports of the Powers concerned.In view of the probable refusal of the Italian Government toattend the proposed Conference? it may no longer be. possible toproceed with the above proposal, which involves the co-operationof all the Mediterranean Powers-?
Further consideration has been given hy the Foreign Officeand the Admiralty as to what measures it is possible for thiscountry to take,  in conjunction with other Powers who may be disposed to actc      Such measures must clearly depend upon thenaval forces available as to which the First Sea Lord has submitted the following views:-&quot;The First Sea Lord is of opinion that it is important to impress on the French privately that the British Navalpeace strength in Destroyers available for operating in theMediterranean is strictly limited, if operations are to becarried out over a period of several months^      Assuming thatall the Destroyers in the Mediterranean and Home Fleets aredevoted to the task of keeping down submarine piracy in theMediterranean some thirty destroyers on the average will beavailable.      Operating in two reliefs this would limit thenumber of Destroyers actually employed at any one time to fifteen.The First Sea Lord feels strongly that If the british navy is asked to do any task of this public nature it shouldbe able to do it efficiently.      At present our Destroyers areacting singly so as to be spread over as large an area aspossible.      A single Destroyer cannot deal effectively with a submarine.      He therefora proposes to divide the fifteenDestroyers available at  any one time Into five or six groups.It is obvious that these five or six groups could only cover alimited area, whereas &quot;re nave to consider the whole of theFrench frontier, the Malta Channel, the coast of greece and the Aegean.      He therefore wishes it to be clearly understood that no scheme can be fully effective.
It is also important that the French Navy shall play an active and not inconsiderable part.      The Russian Navymight at the same time be asked if they were prepared to watch any area in the Aegean.      Although it would be most undesirable to allocate publicly any particular area to anyone country,  it would be necessary, to avoid incidents, thatthe staffs of the countries concerned should have somemutual understanding in the matter.      The French Navy mightbe asked, for instance,  to operate generally in theWestern Basin north of the 40th parallel,  the British Navysouth of that parallel, and the Russian, Greek or TurkishNavies     the Aegean.      Failing the Russian, Greek or TurkishNavies being willing to do this, British forces would have tobe sent to the Aegean as necessary.The First Sea Lord was also concerned with the questionof bases for British Destroyers.      At present they are usingSpanish ports, both Insurgent and Government, which greatlyreduces the strain on personnel and increases the time whichthey can be available at sea.      It is strongly desirable fromthe British Fleet&apos;s point of view to avoid any action whichwould cause the two Spanish belligerents to deny the use oftheir ports to our forces.      If Spanish ports ceased to beavailable,  it would be important that the French should give us the use of Algiers.A further point is that a time limit should be placedin the first instance on the period of the operation.    this can always be extended if necessary but if no time limit is laid down we are committed indefinitely and,  in the quiteprobable event of submarine operations ceasing, our vesselsmight be employed for months on fruitless patrol duties.&quot;
In view of the considerations outlined above it wouldappear desirable for His Majesty&apos;s Government to endeavour tosecure agreement at the conference on the following generalproposals:(I)    That in view of the piratical acts carried out bysubmarines in the Mediterranean against the shipping of various countries, the Powers concerned shall give instructions to their naval forces to take the actionindicated in (ii) and (iii) below with a view to theprotection of all shippingc(ii)   That any submarine attacking a merchant ship in a manner contrary to the rules as to the action of sub-marines with regard to merchant ships contained In the production ces&quot;Verbal signed in London on the 6th Noverrii&quot;e r 1936,is to be counter-attacked and,  if possible,  destroyed.(iii)    This instruction extends to any submarine in thevicinity of a position in which a merchant ship hasrecently been attacked or sunk.(iv)    The above instruction shall remain in force untilchanged but would be reviewed monthly.It is clearly desirable that at some stage, the earlierthe better, Germany and Italy should be asked to co-operate,in the event of their not attending the Conference.7th September,  1937.
APPENDIX    IV.Cypher telegram to Mr.  Ingram (Rome).Foreign Office, September 7th, 1937.      6*30 p.m.No. 281.MOST IMMEDIATE.Your telegrams Nos. 482 and 485.Press reports from Rome indicate that Italiansmay decide not to participate in Nyon Conference onaccount of Soviet Note accusing Italy Of recent sinking of Soviet ships in the Mediterranean.We trust that these reports are not justified andthat Italy will not allow herself to be influenced byaccusations from any quarter as to past happenings.The conference is to discuss the future and we feel thatit is of importance for future conversations between theUnited Kingdom and Italy that both countries should showthat they are anxious in all circumstances to secure freetransit of the Mediterranean for shipping generally.We hope therefore that they will return an affirmative reply to invitation, notwithstanding SovietNote.We attach great importance to the conference andto an agreement being reached between all the powers concerned to take steps which will put an end to acts ofpiracy in the Mediterranean,     As we have stated in the &apos;terms of our invitation, we regard such acts as
intolerable.     We are all the more anxious that theconference should succeed because to reach an international agreement upon an issue of this importance would be amost useful prelude to Anglo-Italian conversations.      It isuseless to deny that recent events,  and the glorificationof Italian intervention in Spanish affairs, have seriouslyperturbed public opinion here.      Moreover,  ItalianGovernment will also have in mind apprehensions previouslyexpressed by you on instructions contained in mytelegrams Nos.  273 and 274 as to the effect of a contin-continuance of recent events in the Mediterranean.     All these factors which taken together cannot be without their effect on the prospect of successful conversations make usmore than ever anxious that the solution of the piracyproblem should be achieved by international agreement in which Italy participates.I note from your telegram No. 480 that Count Gianoregards the Soviet Embassy Note as an attempt to torpedothe conference.      If that be His Excellency&apos;s view thereis surely all the more reason not to allow such an attemptto succeed.      The Italian Government, by showing herselfprepared to co-operate at a conference despite the Sovietnote would surely,  on its own showing, be using the best method to counter the Soviet manoeuvres to which theyrefer.You should speak at once to the Minister for ForeignAffairs in this sense.      I myself have spoken in this sense to Italian Charge d&apos;Affaires.
