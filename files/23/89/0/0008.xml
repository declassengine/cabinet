SPAIN.Situs.tion inthe Mediter-ranean.(previous reference:Cabinet 36(37), Con-conclusion ion 3 *)1*  The Cabinet had. before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Poreign Affairs (CP.-234 (37))circulating the text of the Joint Anglo-French note of the 2nd October proposing tripartite conversationsto consider the vithdravral of foreign volunteers from spain, as well as the text of the Italian reply there-to of the 9th October.At the outset of the discussion the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs handed round copies of thefollowing do cuments .* -(i) A record of a conversation he had hadon the previous evening with the french ambassador, containing a summary of thenon-intervention situation as it appearedto the French Government, and an accountof the proposals they wished to make toHis Majesty&apos;s Government for dealing with it.   At the end of the conversation theFrench Ambassador had voiced his Govern-ment&apos;s anxieties in respect of security in the Mediterranean, with particular reference to the possibility of an Italianattack on the Is 1 and of Minorca. (Appendix I.)(ii) A personal letter from the SpanishAmbassador containing certain considera-tions and reflections on the questionsof non-intervention, withdrawal of foreignvolunteers from Spain, the opening of the franco-Spanish frontier, etc.(Appendix IIJAfter a pause to enable members of the Cabinet to read these documents -The Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs saidthat on the previous evening he had received a telephone message, from, the Ambassador stating thatthe French Government did not now propose, as acondition of acceptance of the suggested reference tothe Non-intervention Committee, to insist on a time limit.    Their present idea was that the Chairman ofthe Non-intervention Committ ee should, make thesuggestion and that the Committee itself should askfor the reply within .   certain time limits, as it had.often done before.    In addition, he said that the
French Government did not persist in their demand that it should be announced at the Committee that ifthe Non-intervention Committee failed, non-interven-tion as &amp; whole must be at an end and arms s^^pplied. tothe Spanish Government only.   The Secretary of Statehimself thought that it would probably be rise tomake another attempt to get agreement at the Committee .He had, however, certain comments to make on theFrench proposals .First, as regards their form, he thought it wouldbe unwise for the British and French Governments to&apos;mentmake a joint state-/before the Committee.    No doubttheir views would be similar on the question of volunteers, and the two Governments might inform one another of the views they intended to express;    butthere should not be any joint representations .    Ifthe Cabinet agreed, he proposed to say this to the ambassador. /. ,Second, he did not agree w4thr the proposal on page of Appendix I that in the event of failure the twoGovernments should &quot;both take identical steps andthat we should authorise temporarily the transit ofarms to the Spanish Government through our own countries and from our own countries&quot;.   He wouldrather prefer to talk on^he general lines of theFrench Note to the Italian Asab^s^rerer, but, on thepoint he had just mentioned, to say that in the eventof the Non-intervention Committee failing to reach agreement we should reserve our liberty of action.He was strengthened in this view by the statement ofthe Spanish Ambassador that what the Spanish Governmentasked for was not arms but the right of transit of arms
across Prance.   He thought the reason for this demand was that the Spanish Government had lost a good manymerchant ships and were finding it difficult to getmunitions through by sea.    It would help them if theycould, be brought to some port on the coast of france and  transferred by land.The fundamental changes, therefore, whicS. he proposed wei^e, first, that the statements of theGovernments should be separate, and, second, that inthe event of failure at the 1-Ton-Intervention committee we should reserve liberty of action.    In addition, the attempt to reach agreement ought to be a genuine one.to him the three proposals of the FrenchGovernment.    These proposals, which are set forth on pages 4 and 5 of Appendix I, were similar to theproposals of His Ha jesty&apos; s Government at the Committeein July.   The chief criticism that  could, be directed against them was in the matter of the proportion ofwithdrawals from the two parties to the Spanish civil war.    IJo-one knew accurately what were the numbers offoreign volunteers in the  two armies.    It would bedifficult to get^agreement of what might be called the left Wing Powers to a nian-for-man withdrawal.   Hewould, however, like to press the French to begin onthat basis, usinr the argument that the important thing was to get the foreigners out of Spain.   He would urge that, even if some Italians remained, the positionwould be much improved, by withdrawals on that basis .In reply to a question he pointed out that, whateverhis personal views, he had been careful not to commit
the Cabinet in any way to the French suggestion thatif we failed in this attempt to reach agreement thefrontier should be opened.The Secretary of State for Air said that he had.very carefully studied the Intelligence Reports from spain; for example, in regard to Majorca.   He saw no evidence that the Italians had increased their forces there since they had undertaken not to do so;    and asto material the evidence that they were sending morewas not conclusive.   He hoped, therefore, that weshould avoid imputing to them intentions of that kind.He hoped also that we should not put forward any pro-posal that was less than the previous proposals wehad made at the &quot;on-Intervention Committee.   He askedin particular if the question of belligerent rights would be considered.   His recollection was that we hadlinked the two questions of volunteers and belligerentrights in such a way that, provided a satisfactorywithdrawal of volunteers were carried out, we should agree to grant belligerent rights .    The French pro-posals were not clear on this point.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thoughtthat perhaps in the record of his long conversationwith the French Ambassador, which he had had to producevery rapidly, he might not have done full justice tothe French proposal in this respect.   His idea, and,he thought, that of the French Government, was thatthe proposals should be similar to those of July.He did. not propose to associate himself in any way with the French information as to Italian intentions-and movements.   From a particularly  reliable source,however, he thought there was no doubt that there hadbeen some despatch of men and material from Italy to spain.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out thatif our object was to obtain the withdrawal of volunteerson both sides it would be a mistake to presuppose theexistence of a breach of recent undertakings.The Lor^ Chancellor felt strongly that if we wishedto obtain a withdrawal of volunteers we should not begin by casting doubt on Italian pledges.The President of the Board of Trade supported this and said he was rather horrified at the statements atthe foot of page 2 and the top of page 3 castingaspersions on Italian good faith.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said thathe was somewhat new to this sort of negotiation.   his impression, however, after reading Appendix I, wasthat French policy differed widely from our policy.The whole tone of the document gave a wrong direction to the line that ought to be taken.   His idea was thatif we demanded the withdrawal of Italian volunteersin a minatory way our effort was bound to result infailure.   The right way to begin appeared to be to try and as certain from the nations concerned, whether theyreally desired to withdraw their volunteers -    If our proposals were put forv.-a.rd as suggested, by the French,the Italians would refuse and the situation would beinfinitely worse.   The first step, then, was toas certain whether they wanted to stop intervention.He had studied the Intelligence Reports, which showed that there had been intervention by Russia and. evenFrance, as well as by Italy;    in fact this was thereason why Franco&apos;s army had tried to destroy therailway communications between France and Spain.He thought, therefore, that the first step was tofind out the real intentions of the parties concerned.
Appendix I gave the impression that the French were working for a breach.The Secretary of State for the Colonies was con-cerned at a statement in the conversation Sir EricPhipps had had with M. Blum, where the latter had indicated that his object was to get Grea$ Britainand Russia together.   He did not think that british public opinion was at all anxious for this.The Prime Minister said he shared the feelingsexpressed by his colleagues-   The present moment mightbe one of critical importance to Europe, and thefuture in the Medtberraneari might well depend uponhow it was handled.   Perhaps we held a key positionin the matter for the reason that the French Govern-ment, though , rather under the influence ofpanic at the moment, undoubtedly attached great import-ance to the maintenance of good relations with us.He thought, therefore, that they v;ould go a long wayto meet our viev-s .He did not agree in the proposal that we should askctid not want the Italians whether they fed or/to withdraw their&quot;volunteers&quot;.    The real position was that the ItalianGovernment wanted General Franco to win, but they didnot want to get entangled more than was necessary.He suspected that Signor Mussolini thought that if allassistance were withdrawn General Franco would win.The Duce would not be willing to admit that there werewith Franco foreign volunteersmore volunteers/from Italy than /on the other side.   he therefore supported the suggestion of the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs that we should begin byproposing a man-for-man withdrawal from each side..If a withdrawal of, say, 30,000 volunteers from each side could be secured, the position would be improvedeven if some Italians remained, and something would-S-
have been done to ease the situation in Europe.He did not think that the Germans wanted to do more in Spain than was necessary for the maintenance ofthe Berlin-Rome &quot;axis&quot;.    He agreed that the Frenchapproach to the examination of the question wasdeplorable, if the object of the Meeting was to getthe volunteers out.   He hoped, therefore, that theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs would do his best to secure that the French should not persist intheir intention to harp on past events, which would only produce discord when the real object was tosecure an improvement in the future.    If we could--approach the question ourselves from the right pointor view &quot;he was not unhopeful that a result might beachieved.    He trusted, however, that we should saythat the situation did not admit of delay, and thatwe should make clear that if no agreement were reached we reserved our position.    He hoped alsothat- the Foreign Secretary would carry out his intention to see the Italian Ambassador.The Secretary of State for Scotland agreed thatit was important to restrain the French, but pointedout that the French Government were in a more diffi-cult position than we ^ere.    They were apprehensive of the development of danger on a third frontier,on which their General Staff was  considerablyperturbed.   He agreed, therefore, that the FrenchGovernment ought to be induced, to adopt a more reasonable line,, hut he did not think that we could persuade them to postpone indefinitely the openingof the frontier.   At the recent Geneva meetings theEastern Mediterranean Powers had shown a great interest in any appearance of a stand being made against Italy, and there appeared to persist a
general idea that the non-intervention policy was-working rather thin and would have to he reconsidered.The French, however, would want to know in advancewhat our attitude would be in the event of failure.The Prime Minister agreed that the FrenchGovernment could not be expected to keep theirfrontier closed indefinitely.   All he proposed should be said was that we reserved liberty of action.We could not go so far as to say that we did not approve the opening of the French frontier in theevent of failure, though we might later on have to urge on them that this course might make thingsFrenchworse even from the / point of view.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,commenting on the discussion, expressed the viewthat some of the criticisms had been rather unfair to the French Government, whose anxieties were by nomeans unjustified.   He did not dissent from theirsuspicions of the intentions of Signor Mussolini inthe Mediterranean.    If our communications were   -threatened in the same vital degree as those of theFrench by an Italian occupation of the BalearicIslands we should feel just&apos;       &quot;- as much anxiety.On the question of the degree of intervention bythe different Powers he pointed out that Italianintervention was of a different character from thatof other countries, in so much as it included largemilitary formations and Italian Generals whose photo-graphs  could be seen in any cinema in Europe.   Hehad seen an Official&apos; of the Foreign Office who washome on leave from our Embassy in Spain, and whothought definitely that the Italians meant to stay in that country and that General Franco could, notdispense with them.   That was what made the FrenchGovernment so anxious.
The Prime Minister suggested- that the criticism.was directed not so much at the French apprehensionsas at the fact that their proposals were not calculated to forward the object in view.This observation received a strong   measureof assent.The Chancellor of the Exchequer s-aid that theFrench Note conveyed the impression that they did not anticipate a favourable result at the lion-intervention committee and that they were thinking much more of thenext step in the event of failure.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreedthat that had been the line of the French Ambassador.They had this much excuse, that intervention in theMediterranean was very close to France. ,. The Home Secretary agreed, but urged that&quot;wacs^best served by another effort atnon-intervention.   This would not be forwarded by theformation of an Anglo-French-Russian bioc   Our a-pperoaeh.ther-fore, must be very different, and we must try to dissuade the French from adopting the line they pro-posed .The President of the Board of Trade said that wewere drifting near to a. position of having to say thatGeneral Franco must not be allowed to win.   The resultof that would, be a European war.     He thought a decisionought to be taken s.lmost now as to whether we wereprepared to face such an eventuality.The Prime Minister ss.id it did. not. matter to uswhich side won so long as it was a Spanish and not aGerman or an Italian victory-   If T;e could secure the$removal of the volunteers it would become a Spanish
civil war and not a foreign v;ar.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,referring to the President of the Board of Trade&apos;remarks, said that the whole object of our policy hadbeen to avoid any spread of the Spanish civil war to europe.   He did not think that the French General staff would mind which side won, but they felt more appre-hensive of the results of an Italian victory.No formal conclusion was recorded, but it was leftto the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to dealwith the French, Italian and Spanish Ambassadors onthe general lines of the discussion, the trend of whichis sunned up in the Prime Minister&apos;s remarks   summarised in &quot;A&quot; on pages 6 and 7, and &quot;B&quot; on page 8.
2 3 22. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat he had received a message from the french ambassador,in response to a remark of his own, thatthe French Government did not now propose thatBritish and French ships should be stationed perman-ently in the roadstead at Minorca, but only thatthey should make occasional calls there.   That was areduction of their original proposals .   The french were naturally/more anxious about Minorca than wewere, as an Italian occupation of that islandthreatened their tirans-Mediterranean communications,and he would like, if possible, to help them in thisrespect.    The last Report of the Consul at Palmashowed that there was friction in Majorca betweenthe Spaniards and the Italians.    Even this Reportindicated that the Italians were back in Majorcawhereas the Germans had gone, in contrast to an earlier Report which had stated that there were still Germans in the island but that the Italians hadwithdravm.   He would like authority, in conjunctionwith the Admiralty and the Prime Minister, to examinethe question of whether anything could be evolved togive satisfaction to the French in Minorca, such asa temporary neutralisation of the island.    If some-thing more than a verbal undertaking could be obtainedthis would reassure the French.The Prime Minister thought the proposal was worthexploration.On the understanding that no action would be taken,and no communication made with any foreign Government,without a Cabinet decision, the Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, in consultationwith the Admiralty, should explore the possibility of some action being taken, such as, for example,
a temporary neutralisation of Minorca,to find a method of reassuring theFrench Government that there would beno change in the national, occupation ofMinorca.-12-\
The Proposed.Conversa-tions .(previous reference:Cabinet 34(3 7)    Con-clusion 8.)ITALY. 3.    The Lord. President of the Council asked whatRelations with, was the present position of the proposed conversations with the Italian Government.    It was bad to open upsuch conversations and to fail; but it might be thatthe continuance of the conversations would be of somevalue in the avoidance of the creation of rival blocsin Europe.    Perhaps, also, we might have more success in individual conversations with Italy than we shouldever get in conjunction with the French.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thoughtthat both the British and Italian Governments felt thatthe Spanish situation stood in the way of success.When he saw the Italian Ambassador he might hark backto the question of conversations and explain that wewere very anxious to make a start and. that the best way to prepare for their success would be to get theSpanish question out of the way.In reply to a question he said that he could notrecall that the Italians had said, in so many wordsthat the Spanish affair stood in the way Of the conversations, but they knew that the question of abyssinia was linked with that of Spain.The Prime Minister agreed, that developments in Spainwere a new factor.    The question of Spain was so linked with that of Abyssinia that at the League of Nationswe could, not secure the preliminary move that was essential to the success of the conversations *   Hethought that the Cabinet might rely on the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs and himself to do every -thing possible to keep the relations with Italy such that the conversations might eventually be renewed.
4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairedrev,T attention to the Communique&apos; which had been issuedby the Admiralty towards the end of the previousweek announcing that no torpedo had been fired atH.M.S. BASILISK.    This had had bad repercussions inEurope.    In the absence of the First Lord of theAdmiralty he asked that the Admiralty might be requested, before issuing any statements of the kind,to consult the Foreign Office.This was agreed to.
PAR EAST;he proposed conference.(previous reference:Cabinet 36(37J, Con-elusion 5.)F. F. 3 &amp; (sj) h--.. ..  .. 5:5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said he hoped, that Brussels would be accepted as the plaeefor the proposed Conference to be summoned under the nine-Power Treaty regarding China, of February, 1982,and that the date would be October 25th. A telegramsetting out the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government wasin course of preparation in the Foreign Office, and itwas hoped to send it to Washington before the departure of the United States Delegation.    He drew attention to telegram No. 433, which had been sent to washington in order to give the American Government a preliminaryindication of our views on economic sanctions.    In replyto a question, he said that no invitations to theConference were to be sent out until the place of meeting was definitely settled..The Prime Minister thought it important that theCabinet should consider our objectives at the comingConference, as well as what we should avoid.   He also thought it very desirable that an understanding shouldbe reached with the United States representatives as tothe line to be taken, as if a difference arose ourposition would be weakened.   He recalled that President-Roosevelt had used the expression &quot;quarantine&quot;, whichhad been generally interpreted as a boycott.   He himself had noticed, however, that the President&apos;s speech was so worded that he could escape from that interpretation.In the House of Commons the Opposition Parties mightwell interpret the phrase as an offer to impose economic sanctions, and would suggest that we were standing inthe way of an effective restraint on Japan.    If this occurred it might be necessary to come into the open.He himself had been thinking over the whole matter,and, after discussion with the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, had arrived at certain conclusions, inwhich he thought the Secretary of State agreed.
These were as follows:-(l)  It was impossible to put in force effectivesanctions without a risk of war.(S) We could put in force ineffective sanctions,but these would not accomplish their purpose andwould result (as in the case of Italy) in prolongedbitterness and ill-will.(3) He doubted whether, even if a sufficient number of countries could, be induced to put economic sane-tions in force effectively, they would operate intime to save China, whose collapse appeared possible and might even be imminent;   The Japanese armiesappeared to be rolling up the Chinese.    Theymight in due course capture Wanking, Hangkow    andCanton, in which case the condition of the Chinesewould be comparable to that of Abyssinia, chiang kai-shek  Chek taking the place of the Emperor.(4)  If sanctions proved effective there was no guarantee that Japan, possibly egged on by Germanyand Italy, would not make some retaliatory attack,e.g., on some oil supplies in the East Indies, oron Hong-Kong, or the Philippines.    If they d.id/ owhat could we do in present conditions?    It wouldnot be safe to send the Fleet to the Par East inthe present position in Europe.   We could not go into sanctions, therefore, without a guarantee fromthe United States of America that they would beprepared to face up to all the consequences whichmight fall on nations with large interests in theFar East.   Even then it was impossible to foreseeinhow long public opinion/America would be preparedto maintain the position.   His conclusion,therefore, was that economic sanctions were of nouse unless backed by overwhelming force.
He had considered the alternative that the powers should, render assistance to China in the forn of warmaterial and munitions.    This, however, would have tobe carried bu sea, and. supplies could, not be ensuredwithout command of the sea, which brought us back tothe question of force.He had. then asked, himself the question whether theConference was to do nothing.   He thought he discerneda possibility that Japan, if treated diplomatically,might consent to some possible terms.    China at present was holding out against the negotiation of terms, being in a position when she was bound, not to show weakness ,It must not be assumed, however, that this was their last word.   He would like to say, therefore, that wehad come to the Conference in the interests of peace and were not going to think of compulsion until concil-iation had. been exhausted.    That would not commit us onthe ultimate issue, since we should only say that we&quot;would, not think of&quot; compulsion.    In his belief that japan might be induced, to make terms he was encouraged by recent telegrams from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador inTokyof   At his request the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs had sent a telegram, to the Ambassadorasking him to keep his  channels of communication open.That was the most fruitful line of action, and. if itsucceeded, it had the advantage of&apos; leaving no bitterness ,He thought that the Foreign Secretary shared his view,except that he required some precautions as to our communications with the United States of America.   he asked if that view commended itself to the Cabinet.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said thaton the previous evening he had. seen Lord Runciman,   whohad told him that the Japanese had. made great efforts to finance their purchases of Australian wool but had.
failed.   This information, he thought, supported theview that the Japanesev whose financial position wasvery difficult, might be willing to discuss peace termsnow, though if their financial position became worsetheir attitude might harden.The Secretary of State for Air said that the PrimeMinister&apos;s line must appeal to the Service Departments.The Chancellor of the Exchequer also agreed with thePrime Minister.   He suggested that the success of theConference would depend upon Japan&apos;s willingness toattend.   Prom this point of view it was rather unfortunate-nate that the Conference was to be summoned in relationto the Hine-Power Treaty regarding China,  the firstArticle of which sta.ted that the Contracting Powersagreed &quot;to respect the sovereignty, the independence,and the territorial and administrative integrity ofChina&quot;.    It was rather difficult to reconcile this with the Prime Minister&apos;s suggested approach to theConference.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs feared that the prospect of Japan being represented at theConference i?-as remote.   He endorsed the Prime Minister&apos;sdescription of the effect of sanctions.   He himself would, never agree to the imposition of sanctions withoutthe agreement of the United States of America and theother signatories of the China Treaty to sirpport thosesanctions by the use of rorce^.   He thought that Presi-dent Roosevelt&apos;s speech was a most important new factor in the situation, and that Anglo-American co-operation was vital.    He thought that in the communication tothe United States Government the question should be approached on the lines of the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;article mentioned by the Prime Minister at the-18-
Meeting of the Cabinet referred to in the margin,namely, to make clear that we could not go intosanctions without a definite undertaking by all con-cerned. to support them in all circumstances .   Hewould, however, not like to indicate that, in the extremely unlikely event of the American Governmentmadia-gig aii offj.r on those lines, we should refuse.For his part, in spite of all the dangers, he thought we should, take -a-risk in such an unlikely eventuality.The Secretary of State for Scotland doubted whetherthe odds against such an offer were quite so great ashad. been suggested.    President Roosevelt&apos;s speechhad been made after his own Observer had reported v.-hathad happened at Geneva.   He thought there were some notunhopeful features in the situation.   The Chineserepresentatives at Geneva had expressed the view thatthe Japanese armies were not attempting to over-runChina, but that their object was to push the Chineses-cross-. the Yellow River in order to get them out ofthe way with a view to an eventual attack on theU-S.S.R. in Eastern Siberia.   He saw no difficulty,however, in laying emphasis on conciliation as theobject of the Conference.   Our Delegation at Genevahad put all the stress on this point.   He agreed,however, that we should explore the possibility of close co-operation with the United States.     Dictatorshad a habit of going on until they were stopped, andthe example of one might be followed by others, withdangerous results in Europe.The President of the Board of Education agreed inthe Prime Minister&apos;s proposals.   As to the militarysituation, he thought it possible that the Japanesemight soon find, themselves marching across a vast
country in the grip of a hard winter, getting nowhere,like Napoleon in Russia.   If the Chinese could hold outuntil the end of the year and then adopt guerilla war-fare, the Japanese might be unable to bring the war toan end.   This prospect might incline them to negotia-tions .The Secretary of State for War read a Report fromthe Military Attache&quot; indicating the probability of anearly victory for Japan.   He thought it important notto put Japan &quot;in the dock&quot; at the Conference.    If we made clear that our object was to bring about peace,the prospects were not unhopeful.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs agreed with the Prime Minister.   The situation in Europe was too critical to justify our taking any risks in the far east.    It was important, from the point of view of homepolitics, to make clear to the world that the UnitedStates of America were whole-heartesly with us/in thismatter.   He thought it quite possiblethat the Japanesemight be willing to make an effort to secure peace.Later he reminded the Cabinet that some of the dominions were signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty.   He thought we ought to get into line with them even before weapproached the United States of America, and suggestedthat the Dominions Office and the Foreign Office should arrange for discussions.   He agreed that care would haveto be exercised owing to the indiscretions of the repre-sentative of one Dominion.   He proposed to approach themby way of informal discussion.The Lord. Chancellor agreed with the Prime Minister&apos;sanalysis. He thought it unnecessary for the Cabinet tomake up their minds today what to do if the UnitedStates of America wanted to impose sanctions.-SO-
The Lord Baifrivy 0eat agreed with the Lord Chancellor.He thought wq should be content with stating thesituation frankly to the United States of America.Even if America did take a more bellicose line than we, we should have to think carefully before comnit-ting to them the defence of our interests in the ParEas t.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat it was important to avoid putting the AmericanGovernment in a position to say that they could haveclea.red up the situation but for our unwillingness.The Prime Minister thanked his  colleagues for theexpression of their views.    It was very useful to theForeign Secretary, other members of the Cabinet, and himself, to know the genera.1 lines on which bothforeign policy and public statements should be based.He thought nothing should be done to suggest theimposition of sanctions.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That our policy towards the conference should be framed on the lines of thePrime Minister&apos;s statement, summarisedon the first three pages of this recordano&quot; marked &quot;C&quot;, and of the subsequentdis cuss ion:(b) That the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs, in concert with the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, shouldtake such action as he might deem appro-priate for informing the Governments ofthe Dominions of our policy and, so faras possible, for securing their agreement.-21-

PALESTINE.The HighCommissioner(previous reference:Cabinet 3 6(37) , Con-clusion 9 .)7o   The Cabinet had before them a Most secret memorandum bjr the Secretary of State for the Colonies(CP.-232 (37)) outlining the circumstances which had led him to a personal conclusion that the question ofa change in the High Commissionership of Palestinemust be taken into serious consideration.   If achange was thought desirable by the Cabinet, he stated a preference for the appointment of a civilianwith, if possible, administrative experience overseas.After the Secretary of State for theColonies had explained the position and his own regret at the need for changing so admirable a public servant,the Prime Minister made a statement in the course ofwhich he said that the evidence placed before him was conclusive as to the present High Commissionerssuccess in the first five years,     i but   indicated that,in the present different; circum&amp;tan-aes, a change ^was desirable.     He had felt that the resignation ofa public servant from such a conspicuous post was siunusual that the Cabinet ought to have an opportunityof expressing its views.     If the Cabinet agreed inthe change, he suggested that everything possible shouldbe done to soften the blow to the High Commissioner,against whom no one had the smallest complaint f\nthe ground that he had not carried out the policy and instructions of the Government.    There were two possibilities -(a) That the High Commissioner should return to Palestine before resigning,* in order to avoid any suggestion thathe was intimidated:(b) That his successor should be a man ofsuch a calibre that he would &quot;bedifferentiated at once and no comparison between the two could be possible.The Secretary of State for Air,who had been associated longer than any of his colleagues with the
High Commissioner, paid a warm tribute to his success inhis first term of office.     He was glad that there was nohint of condemnation irPhis action in the past0     Thepolicy the High Commissioner had carried out was asmuch that of the Government as his own.     No one, however,could say that changes and circumstances did not requirechanges in personnel.     He welcomed the suggestion thatthe High Commissioner should not resign until after hehad returned to Palestine partly for the reason given bythe Prime Minister, but partly also to ease the way forhis successor, and for the benefit of British prestige.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs said    he    had also worked with the High Commissioner.He supported the Secretary of State for the Colonies,the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Air,adding that such were his qualities that if only he hadbeen appointed earlier to Palestine, he might have madethe Mandate a success.The Lord Privy Seal who, as a former parliamentary under-Secretary in the Colonial Office, had hadopportunities for hearing the views of officials from palestine, suggested that the period of the HighCoitsnissioner&apos;s return should be restricted, in order thatpolice and officials might be encouraged by the presenceof a new High Commissioner to support a new policy.The Secretary of State for India took the same view.     An important change of policy was involved andit might be a mistake for the present High commissioner to inaugurate it*.     If he returned for a few months andthen left, it might be said that either he disagreed orfelt himself incapable of carrying out the new policy.
His main feeling was that a new policy required anew High Commissioner, and he supported this by examplesfrom Indian experience,.(The Secretary of State for War withdrew atthis points)The Prime Minister said that the observations of the Cabinet would have to be considered^     Perhapsit might suffice to announce that the High Commissionerwas going back for a short time.The Cabinet agreed:To leave the matter to the discretion of the Secretary of Statefor the Colonieso

It would benecessary shortly to lay a White Paper and tointroduce the requisite legislation.   He pointed out,however, that under the modified settlement theGovernment were relieved of the necessity to seekpower to pay compensation to the Company for themaintenance of strategic cables.The Cabinet approved the proposals of theChancellor of the Exchequer as set forth in CoPo  233 (37),

11.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary (CP.-230 (37)) on the subject of theprohibition of political processions in London, cover-ing a Minute to him by the Commissioner of theMetropolitan Police, in connection with the recentFascist demonstration in Bermondsey.    In this Minutethe Commissioner urged, a reconsideration of thequestion and. suggested that a general ban should be imposed under the Public Order Act on all politicalprocessions for three months, during which period the advisability of legislation making processions of allkinds in the streets illegal once and for all, shouldbe considered.    The Home Secretary was advised that ifit were desired to extend the existing ban over the/hole Metropolitan area, amending legislation would almost certainly be necessary.   He was averse from introducing legislation of this kind, however, unless he was satisfied that the Party Leaders and the Houseof Commons generally approved of it.   He suggested,therefore,  that the first step would be to sound theParty Leaders as to their attitude towards extension ofthe Act oIn the course of an.  introductory, statement,the Home Secretary said that he was now satisfiedthat further legislation would not be needed.Nevertheless, he felt that he would have to sound theLeaders of the Opposition Parties in the House ofCommons.      In doing so, he did not propose to say thatthe Cabinet had taken a decision but merely tointimate that he was receiving a great many suggestionsfrom responsible quarters that eteg^e^lj^e^jate&amp;feprocessions should he stoppedo
The Cabinet were reminded that theposition in Liverpool was almost as acute   as inLondon from this point of view0The Home Secretary thought that publicopinion was moving rapidly in this question.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed with the Home Secretary that new legislation wasnot required     The new fact was that whenever aprocession was permitted there was serious disorder.He agreed, therefore, that confidential soundingsshould be taken, but he thought that this should bedone under existing powers which applied to Liverpoolas well as to London.The Home secretary pointed out that in view1of earlier undertakings, he could not take action without consulting the Leaders of the Opposition.A suggestion was made that the Home secretary might arrange for a Parliamentary Question to beasked, which would enable him to state that thesubject was under consideration.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointedout that when processions had been prohibited in theEast End of London, the prohibition had applied toall political processions.     If this course were adopted, even processions of the unemployed to hyde park would be forbidden.     The Act, however, enableda differentiation to be made between the class ofprocession, and he thought this point ought to beconsidered.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairsanticipated Labour Opposition to stopping May Day
processions and others of a similar character.He was, however, in favour of exploring the position with the Labour Party.Without taking a decision on the questionof principle the Cabinet agreed:To authorise the Home Secretaryto sound the Party Leaders as totheir attitude towards theprohibition of political processions.

APPENDIX I.RECORD OP A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE FORFOREIGN AFFAIRS AND THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR ON 1STH OCTOBER.The French Ambassador asked to see me this eveningwhen he said I would no doubt have received fromSir Eric Phipps an account of his interview withM. Delbos.    He wished now to give me a summary of thesituation as it appeared to the French Governmentand an account of the proposals they wished to make to us for dealing with it.   First he would deal withthe conclusions which the French Government had come toabout the Italian Note.   That Note could hardly havebeen more negative in essential points.    It ruled out,though in the most friendly manner, each of the proposals that were made.    The Italian Government refused to admit that the settlement of the problem of foreign nationals in Spain was an urgent necessity; they sought to widen the whole scope of the discussion and suggested that theLondon Committee should seek to deal with the subjectwithout previous consultation between the Powers principally concerned.    It was difficult to escape therefore the conviction that the Italian Government hoped that thesame difficulties would arise once more as had prevailedin the Committee last July.    It seemed to be their desireto gain time in order perhaps to proceed to the despatch ofmore aeroplanes and men to Spain.    If we were to prolongnegotiationst then, in the view of the French government we should be favouring this manoeuvre.    In such a situation
there were two alternatives open; either to notify-through the diplomatic channel our decision - whatever thatmight he - or to go hack to the Non-intervention committee.    As regards the first alternative, theFrench Government saw some inconvenience in followingit.    They were fully alive to the emphasis I had laid in my previous interview with M. Corhin upon theimportance of justifying their attitude beforeworld opinion.    They did not wish to appear to bear the responsibility for breaking up the Non-interventionAgreement.    Therefore, the French Government were preparedto adopt the second alternative and to go back to theNon-intervention Committee.But if this was to be done it was essential toput before the Committee firm and decisive proposalswhich should be as clear as possible and in respect ofwhich we should ask for an answer in a short time.    TheFrench Government would like to ask for a meeting ofthe Committee on the 15th of this month.    At that committee both Governments would make in the same spirita statement of the situation which would come toidentical conclusions.    They would recall the failureof the negotiations of last July and emphasise theimportance of making a further effort to come to asettlement.    They would recall certain facts which couldnot unhappily be contested.    First the ItalianGovernment had since last July proclaimed publicly theirsolidarity with one side of the contest in Spain,despite their undertaking of non-intervention and hadgloried in the victory of Italian armies in Viscaya.
This had created a situation which must he referred to.Nonetheless, our statements would continue, in spite ofthis and of the preparations in Italy for the despatchof more men to Spain, in respect of which information had reached the French Government, they had decided totake advantage of the Nyon Agreement and of the assurances offered by the Italian representative atGeneva to M. Delbos, to propose to the Italian Governmentpreliminary conversations; as a result of which it v/ashoped that it would subsequently be possible for theLondon Committee to reach results.    This procedure had seemed to the French Government and to ours normal and reasonable.    Our statements would go on to mention thatin the interval of waiting for a reply further reports had reached us of further arrivals of Italian aeroplanesin Majorca and of the alleged bombing of Spanish harboursby Italian aeroplanes.    Both Governments found themselvesconfronted by these reports which further aggravated thesituation when the Italian reply had arrived.Our statements j. having thus given an account ofthe situation up to date would then explain that it wasnot possible for our two Governments to agree that thesituation could drag on any longer in useless discussion,therefore we had thought it necessary to formulate preciseproposals and ask the Governments represented at theNon-intervention Committee to come to conclusions as quickly as possible upon them.    The Ambassador explainedthat in the view of the French Government not more than three or four days should be required to do this.    We
should then ask the Governments to agree:(l)    To take up the British proposal of last july and to state that the principle of that proposal wasdef initelj&apos;&apos; acceptable to them.      (I asked at this pointwhether the French Ambassador had any information as to theRussian attitude.      M.  Corbin replied that pressure wasbeing applied in Moscow to induce the Soviet Government tomodify their attitude.      He would let me know as soon ashe received any reply).      In asking the Governments toagree in principle to the British scheme we should make itclear that it was understood that the granting of belligerent rights could be considered when the LondonCommittee thought that the work of the withdrawal had made effective progress.(2)    The Powers should be asked to agree that animmediate start should be made with the withdrawal of anumber of volunteers.      The proportions should be roughlytaken into account.      It would be agreed that not more thana fortnight should elapse between the date of the agreement and the beginning of the first withdrawal.      The governments on the Committee undertook to use their influence with theGovernments of Valencia and Salamanca to secure their agreement.      I reminded the Ambassador of the difficultieswhich had been met with in the past with this question of proportion.      What were the views of the French Government?The Ambassador replied that he did not think we ought to makegreat difficulties over this at the start - it would surelybe fair if we asked for the withdrawal of three of Francorsside as compared with two from Valencia.      If that was our
view of a just proportion it would probably be wise to askfor a proportion of two to one to start with.(3)    The Governments should undertake to send no morevolunteers and should agree to the principle of a reinforcedsystem of control.      I understood that the French Governmentmeant by this last proposal the suggestions which had beensubmitted to the Non-intervention Committee by its Boardof Control.These would be the proposals which the Committee wouldbe asked to accept.      It should be clear, however,  that ifthese three proposals were not accepted then both Govern-ments would take a decision not to assent to prolongeddiscussions.      I asked the Ambassador whether this decision was to be announced at the Committee or was only to be an understanding between ourselves.      The Ambassador said thathe understood that it should be announced at the Committee,but he would confirm this.     We would further state thatif these proposals were not accepted then the two governments would consider that in so far as concerned themselves the observance of the Non-intervention Agreement was suspended.They would make it clear that such suspension would bebrought to an end and the policy of non-interventionresumed as soon as the causes for which this step had beentaken had been removed.     At the same time the Ambassadorexplained that in the view of the French Government it was desirable to decide in advance what attitude we should adopt in the event of this decision having to be taken.They considered it essential that we should act together.
The French Government contemplated that we should bothtake identical steps and that v/e should authorise temporarilythe transit of arms to the Spanish Government through ourown countries and from our own countries.      Thisauthorisation would exclude only war material which wasthe property of the State.      I remarked to the ambassador that I would of course report what he had said to mycolleagues and that I would require time to consider theseproposals, but on his asking for my personal impressionsI remarked, that it seemed that the French Government were asking more from us than I had understood to be their intention at our last interview.      While I thought theFrench Government were wise in taking the Italians attheir word and going to the Committee, I thought at thesame time that it was asking a lot of us to suggest thatif we failed in this attempt then non-intervention as awhole must be at an end. and arms supplied to SpanishGovernment only.      He must know how much attachmentthere was to this policy of non-intervention in thiscountry.      On the other hand., if this final attempt tosecure progress in the Committee were to fail, I thought the French Government would be justified if they decidedto allow the transit of arms across their frontier to spain, but it was one thing to ask us to endorse thatdecision and another to ask us to take similar action tothat which the French Government might decide upon inrespect of the export of arms to Spain.The Ambassador admitted the distinction which I had drawn, but said that his Government attached the greatest
importance to acting with us.    They had put forward theseproposals which seemed to them reasonable in the conditions.He wished to emphasise that in their view the question was whether we were to go on allowing the Italians toabuse the Non-intervention Agreement indefinitely orwhether we were going to try to put a stop to that stateof affairs.   He feared that if we did not make a realattempt to better the situation then we should come to aperiod of even greater difficulties-His Excellency went on to explain that what he had said dealt with the problem of non-intervention.   Therewas another problem - that of security in the mediterranean in respect of which we were justified in acting apart fromthe Non-intervention Committee and in accordance with ourown vital interests.   The French Government were gravelypre-occupied at the signs they saw of an impending attempt on Minorca.   The French Government felt that they must beready for some such development as the Italian government might create in that island which would have very grave consequences for them.   They therefore suggested thatthe Franco-British naval forces&apos; should create a con-centration of strength in Minorca.   It would be all themore easy for them to do this because Minorca was in theFrench area of supervision under the Nycn Agreement andttae -French Government- had already instructed their naval staff to get into touch with the Admiralty.   the ambassador said the intention of the French Government wasto take some action as a deterrent to prevent Italianoccupation of Minorca which he repeated, must create a very
serious international situation.      In this connexion Iwould be well aware of the importance of the Frenchcommunications with North Africa.I replied that I appreciated fully French anxieties inrespect of the Balearic Islands, at the same time, I wasnot quite clear how this joint naval concentration was tomeet the situation.      What did the French Government proposthat we should say if General Franco were ii* due course to notify us that he proposed to attack Minorca and asked ustherefore to remove ourselves from the island so that our ships might not be involved in the attack?     Was it thenintended that we should either refuse to go or else removeourselves?     There seemed no third alternative.The Ambassador was not able.to answer these questionswhich he undertook to refer to his Government.      He remarkedhowever, that the apprehensions of the French Government wernot of an occupation by General Franco but of an occupation by Italy.I replied that I found it hard to believe the attack onMinorca, if it oame, would take the form of a direct attack by Italy.      It was hardly conceivable that Signor Mussoliniwould send a Division direct from Genoa to take Minorca.On the other hand, it did seem likely that some attack might take place from Majorca.I undertook to consider carefully the French Government&apos;spreoccupations in this respect, though I gave the Ambassadorno grounds to think that the particular proposal he putforward in respect of Minorca would be one which we couldendorse.FOREIGN OFFICE.12th October, 1937.-8-
APPENDIX II.TRANS L AT ION.SPANISH EMBASSY.11th October,   1957.PERSONAL.My clear Minister and Friend,Allow me in the present circumstances, which are particularly serious for ray country,  to take the liberty ofsubmitting to you in a personal and friendly capacity acertain number of considerations and reflections.      Ifyou find ray initiative inopportune or out of place, be sogood as to excuse me,  considering my heavy responsibilities and how anxious I am to neglect nothing which mightcontribute to the discovery of a way leading to a lasting-solution of the difficulties through which my country ispassing.As you know, we have always been firmly convinced thatthe withdrawal of foreign combatants taking part in thestruggle in Spain constituted a step essential to ensurereal and effective application of non-intervention and torender possible,   in addition,  the contemplation of an earlyending to the struggle.      That is why  re gave our assent atGeneva to the encouragements contained in the draft resolution submitted to the Assembly,  in connection with therecent Franco-British demarche to the Italian Government.Personally I have always felt certain doubts regardingthe conditions in which this demarche was carried out,which the negative Italian reply has justified as being wollfounded.       To-day Italy docs not meet with any limit to thedevelopment of her action in Spain.      On the other hand the&quot;enemy11 against whom Italy must fight in Spain,,  that is
to say,   the Spanish Government,  are- always embarrassed andhampered by the strict maintenance towards thorn ofnon-intervention.      I do not wish to revert here to theoft repeated arguments and considerations regarding theiniquity and injustice of this situation.      But from apractical and roalistic point of view it must be recognisedthat as long as this situation is not modified it cannot reasonably be hoped to obtain,  simply by diplomatic pressurea substantial change in Italian policy in Spain.      It will bepossible to obtain such a change only if,  in advance todiplomatic action,  measures are taken to oppose to Italianaction ( and   that even if it is only in a proportion of 100 to l)some other action equally real and tangible.      These measures would in the first place avoid time working exclusively inItaly7s favour and would consequently discourage thetendency of the Italian Government to drag out thenegotiations;    in the second place5   they would make theItalian Government understand clearly that in order to attain her end Italy would have to be prepared to face in spain difficulties much greater then those for which she hadbargained.In short, Franco-British diplomatic pressure toobtain Italy&apos;s acceptance of the withdrawal of foreigncombatants in Spain would have had,  or might have had, some success if it had been oreceded at least by the openingof the Franco-Spanish frontier and by a declaration of freedom of transit on French territory for war material.It is not a question of obtaining any positive helpwhatever from France or England and no one has ever thought of asking for such help.      It is not even a quo-stion,
at least for the moment,  of restoring integrally to spain her normal rights under international law whichwould involve as a consequence the re-establishment of freedom of trade.      It would purely and simply be arestoration of rights under international law in a smallsection of the large field of non-intervention:    theopening    of the Franco-Spanish frontier and the liberty of transit across French territory which would not involve aderogation from a single one of the embargoes on the sale ofwar material in France and even less in England.      seeing that in addition the ^roblem of the frontier and of transittraffic only concerns France there could be no basis forclaiming that Franco-British unity of action would demand the adoption in this connection of analogous measures inthe two countries.The validity of those considerations has been considerably reinforced by the negative reply returned bythe Italian Government.      Now it is no longer a question of ascertaining whether with a view to facilitating the successof the joint Anglo-French demarche it would have beenadvisable to start with the opening   of the Franco-Spanishfrontier.      After the Italian negative reply it might wellbe asked whether the adoption of such a measure would not constitute the strict minimum for the fulfilment of the moral obligation represented for England and France by theresolution,  adopted by the Sixth Committee of trho Assemblybut whose adoption by the Assembly itself was mad6s impossibleby the opposition of Albania and Portugal,      The onl/question which remains to be decided is whether the negative Italian reply is considered by the British andFrench Governments as an adequate basis for agreeing to the
impossibility of effecting in i!   brief delay&quot;(starting from the 2nd October.&apos;) the &quot;immediate endentire withdrawal of non-Spanish combatants taking partin the Spanish struggle&quot;.      Unless the two Governmentsconsider that that negative reply does not constitute an insurmountable obstacle to effecting that with-drawal with only a brief delay they are morally boundwith the sixteen other countries who adhered to non-intervention and who voted for the resolution at theAssembly to contemplate the end of non-intervention.And once the end of non-intervention is contemplatedwhat more modest and moderate measures could one think of than the opening of the Franco-Spanish frontier andthe declaration of freedom of transit on French soil?I know that the Spanish Government atta.ch.es thegreatest possible practical importance to that measure.On the other hand,  it is understandable that the FrenchGovernment should not adopt it without the consent of theBritish Government.      An assent, which I repeat,  docSSnot involve for England, because of the particularnature of the measure which is under discussion,   theadoption of an analogous measure and still less the slightest interference with the system in force for theprohibition of the sale of war material to Spain.These are the terms in which the problem presentsitself to-day,  at least from the point of view of theSpanish Government,  and I know only too well that it isnot from you nor from the British Government that I needfear any disinclination to recognise that Spain is sufficiently interested in the question for the point ofview of the Spanish Government to be taken intoconsideration.Yours sincerely,(Signed)    P, AZCARATS.-4-
APPENDIX III.Draft of The King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament.October 22. 1937.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons.IT was with deep satisfaction that the Queen and I on the solemn occasion ofOur Coronation received the proofs of the loyalty and affection of My peoples andof their devotion to the Crown. The significance of this Ceremony was emphasisedby the presence of Prime Ministers of My Dominions, and representatives of MyEmpire of India and every part of My Empire overseas.The deliberations of the Imperial Conference, which followed immediatelyafter the Coronation^afforded ample evidence of the value of such meetings forthe discussion of matters of common concern, and I earnestly trust that theirresult may be to enhance the security as well as the prosperity and happiness ofMy peoples in all parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations.My relations with foreign Powers continue to be friendly.The Treaty of Alliance with Egypt has been duly ratified by Myself and theKing of Egypt. In the spring of this year an international Conference was heldat Montreux for the abolition of the capitulations in Egypt. Thanks to thepractical and conciliatory spirit in which the complex issues involved were facedby the delegations of the participating governments, the Conference was broughtto a successful issue.Throughout the course of the past year My Ministers have followed withconcern and anxiety the tragic events in Spain, and have persisted in theirendeavours to prevent the spread of the conflict beyond that country&apos;s borders.I am happy to note the successful outcome of the Conference at Nyon.I have seen with the greatest concern the development of hostilities between japan and China. The sufferings which have been inflicted upon the innocentnon-combatants by attacks from the air and at sea have caused Me particulardistress. I trust that the Conference of Powers, which is shortly to be called together, may contribute to bring this deplorable conflict to an end.In the field of naval limitation I am happy to state that the London naval treaty signed in London on the 25th March, 1936, has now been ratified byall the signatories. Further, with a view to extending the scope of that Treaty,bilateral naval agreements have recently been concluded between My Governmentand the governments of Germany and of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.The provisions of the Government of India Act. giving responsible govern-ment to the Provinces of India, and of the Government of Burma Act have comeinto operation during the year, and I am watching with deep interest develop-ments in both countries. I hope that in no distant time there may be realised the full project of a Federation of India.Members of the House of Commons,I thank you for the provision you have made for the Public Service.I thank you for the provision you have made for the honour and dignity ofthe Crown.15977
My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,I note with much satisfaction the continued strengthening and improvementof all three of My defence forces, as a result of the measures laid before you lastyear. The heavy burden of this necessary rearmament is to some extent lightenedby the continued growth of trade, employment, saving and purchasing poweramong My people.The provision of facilities for recreation and healthy outdoor activity, moreespecially for the younger members of the community, has always been a matterof special interest to Me. It was therefore with particular pleasure that I gaveMy assent last summer to the Physical Training and Recreation Act. It is Myhope that the fullest possible use will be made of this contribution to the physicalwell-being, and through it the happiness, of the nation.The national health services have been further developed and improved. Therate of progress in the clearance and replacement of slums has been satisfactorilymaintained, the abatement of overcrowding is proceeding, and house building hascontinued at a high rate.The Act relating to the Special Areas has been continued for a further period and additional powers have been conferred with the object of furtherpromoting the establishment of new industrial undertakings in those areas andin other areas of heavy unemployment.I have given My assent to a Bill in which the law regulating the conditionsof work in factories has been codified and brought up to date, and greatly improved provision has been made for securing the safety and health of factoryworkers.My assent has also been given to Bills extending voluntary insurance for pensions to persons with limited income, making further provision for the superannuation of local government officers, and providing for the distributionof Exchequer grants with increased regard to the needs of local authorities.Bills have been passed into law to assist the livestock industry and to promoteits efficiency; to increase the productivity of agriculture by measures to encourage the application of lime and basic slag to the soil; to promote land drainage; toprovide further assurance for the cultivation of cereals and to combat animaldiseases. Assistance to the milk industry has been continued for an additionalperiod.I have given My assent to a Measure extending, with certain amendments,the operation of the Empire Settlement Act, 1922. for a further period of fifteen years.Acts have been passed to authorise the raising of defence loans, to increasethe amount which may be issued to the Exchange Equalisation Account, tocontinue the temporary subsidy granted to tramp shipping and to consolidate andamend the law relating to export guarantees.The Bills relating to Scotland which have received My assent have included,in addition to Bills dealing with Exchequer grants to local authorities and the superannuation of local government employees, Measures for the development and improvement of maternity services, for the regulation of the wages ofagricultural workers, and. for the better custody of public records.A number of other Measures of public utility have been passed into law.I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your labours.
