1, The Cabinet had before them the following doou-ments by the Minister for Co-01dination of Defence:-C.P.-199 (37)   containing a copy of aletter to the Prime Minister,  covering a Memorandum on The Wavy and its Relationto the Fleet Air Arm and. Shore-based aircraft, in which he reported the resultsof the examination he had undertaken atthe request of Mr Baldwin when PrimeMinister.   After outlining t3he historyof the question, which had been thesubject not only of prolonged  controversybut of repeated. Inquiries, and summarising the arguments laid before him, the minister stated, in his Memorandum that he had. cometo the conclusion (i) that the admiralty should be responsible for selecting andtraining the personnel, and generallyfor the organisation of the Fleet air arm:    and. (ii) that the Admiralty&apos;claim for the specific allocation of&quot;a certain irreducible minimum of shore-based aircraft&quot;, employed upon such duties as trade defence,  coastal or sea reconnals-sance, anti-submarine work and other localpatrols, and attacks on enemy sea-borneforces, ought not to be admitted:C.P--199-A (37), being a supplementary report to the above, in which the minister stated that since submitting his Reporthe had. studied, a Memorandum by the AirStaff dealing with certain.in questions of administrative detail, which had not been presented, to him before his Report was submitted, and. that he had also had. theadvantage of a. discussion with the Chiefof the Air Staff on these matters.   As aresult, however, he saw no reason foraltering the recomm.enda.tion embodied inhis main Report.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said.he did not base his recommendations for the Fleet air arm on any allegation of defects of aircraft orpersonnel.   His  conclusion was that the proper place for the Fleet Air Arm was in the Admiralty ,   He quotedthe following extract from a Note by Lord Salisbury,dated. March 15, 1928 (C.I.D. Paper No.867-B):-&quot;.....When the evolution to which I have referred has reached a point of compara-tive stability it is of course possiblethat the first view will gradually replace the second,, and that, ultimately, theFleet Air Arm may be cut loose from theremainder of the Air Service and becomein all respects a special branch of theFleet like any other.&quot;THE FLEET air arm.Reports bythe Ministerfor Co-ordina-tion ofDefence.
That indicated the possibility of an eventual changeIn the responsibility for the Fleet Air Arm, and repre-sented the position he had arrived at in the conclusionconveyed in his Report.   He had ;also reached the conclusions-sion that the change would  contribute to the efficiency of the Fleet Air Arm and the avoidance of difficultiesbetween the Departments.   The Minister then quoted thefollowing passage from paragraph 21 pf his Report:-&quot;I find, it impossible to resist, the inferencethat when so much that concerns the air unitsdepends upon the Naval element in the ship and in the Fleet the Admiralty should beresponsible for selecting and training the personnel and generally for the organisationof the Fleet Air Arm&quot;.That passage, he thought, might, require some modification.He now thought that possibly the Admiralty might not bethatentirely responsible for the system of selection, and./partof the training also might not be carried, out directly under the Admiralty:    but in any event the Admiralty wouldbecome responsible for the organisation.On the question of shore-based aircraft he had nodoubt at all that the present system was right, subject-to special training being given to the personnel concernedin over sea work.The Secretary of State for Air interpolated that suchtraining was going on already. Special Navigation Schoolshad been set up.The First Lord, of the Admiralty said that he hadinherited this  controversy.    The Admiralty were satisfied,on the whole, with the view taken by the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence.Referring to the second paragraph of the Report, hesuggested that the definition of the Fleet Air Arm as applying to Carriers, Capital Ships and Cruisers, was hot-quite complete, as it would exclude aircraft carried, insubmarines, and helicopters.   He thought the realdefinition should be for ship-borne aircraft.-2-
The Minister for- Co-ordination of Defence said that neither aircraft in submarines nor helicopters had beenbrought to his notice.The First Lord, of the Admiralty continued, that thedecision on shore-based aircraft was not what theAdmiralty had hoped for. but they were willing to accept it.&apos;Referring to paragraph 25 of the Report, theAdmiralty urged, that the personnel especially trained towork/with Naval forces over the sea should not merely undergo a course of that kind, but should be set aside definitelyfor coastal duties, so that the Admiralty could alwayscount on their being there in any emergency.    They thought,it very important that the personnel specialising forwork over sea and. sometimes in conjunction with the Fleetshould  constitute a. force ma.inta.ined. for this purpose atall times and only removable by a Cabinet decision.    this they regarded as essential to the safety of the country,since without such permanent allocation excessive burdensmight be thrown upon the Fleet which might prove too heavyfor it.    The Admiralty agreed that the initial trainingmight be under the Air Ministry, but on the matter of selection they felt that they had special sources for thesupply of personnel and they would like to retain this responsibility,    ^he Admiralty thought that the new scheme could now be worked, out on the basis of co-opera, t. ionmhe next stage was for the Admiralty to work out a detailedplan, and they had already, made considerable progress.He hoped that the matter would, proceed, rapidly, as thelong delay in reaching any de-cision had. caused, despondencyin the Navy, with the result that the pilots required, forthe Fleet Air Arm were now down by 50,   He suggested, thatthe Cabinet should, invite the Minister for Co-ordinaticnof Defence to decide.any differences that might arise-3-
between the two Departments.   He was confident that agood scheme could be worked, out, and that the relationsbetween the two Departments would be improved.    Sinceassuming office as First Lord he had been surprised, tofind, the strength of feeling on this subject in theAdmiralty and, indeed, among all Naval Officers to whom he ha^ spoken.    Moreover, he had recently seen the officer who had  commanded, our forces on the American Station, who reported that our Navy was inferior to the TJ.S.-,A. navy in the matter of naval aviation, and. in that respect only.The Prime Minister thought it right to remind theCabinet that operational control was already under theAdmiralty.    The issue before the Cabinet now was in thematter of training personnel, supplies and orga.nisa.tion.He asked the Minister for Co-ordination o^ Defence if hehad anything to say on the Admiralty proposals forallocating shore-based squadrons permanently to oversea. work.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said thathe had. not accepted that proposition in his Report, and.it was not his  conception that shore-based, aircraft shouldbe earmarked for Naval purposes.    ^hat was made clear inhis Report.    The specialised, training, however, remained to be worked out.    Subject to this, aircraft must beavailable wherever the focus of air activity was at themoment,    ^o allocate permanently would strike at thebasis of his plan for the proper disposition of air forces.Turning to future arrangements, he said he had. notyet seen the Admiralty plan, but he had some ideas himself as to the organisation which he would be prepared tocommunicate to the Cabinet.

The Secretary of State for Air appreciated1, the care and trouble taken by the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence.   The point to which he, in his work on tineCommittee of Imperial Defence, had always attached, mostimportance was  co-operation between the three Servicesand the building up of the three Staffs to work as one.In his view this was essential either for winning oreven averting a war.    The Minister for Co-ordination ofDefencf , in his Report, had. made two principal re commend-at ions .    The first was that the strategy of war must bebased on co-operation between the Departments and not ontheir self-sufficiency.    In paragraph 19 of the Reportthe Minister said, that he found, the Air Ministry argumenton this subject very convincing, and added that &quot;on general principles the right solution of the problem ofthe use of ai^ power in aid. of the Navy is not to makethe Navy self-contained in point of its air requirements,but to call on the Air Force to meet them.&quot;.    The Ministertherefore he.d. no hesitation in saying that all shore-based,aircraft, including flying-boats, must be the responsi-bility of the Air Ministry.    That morning the minister had. explained that,  conformably to this principle,aircraft must be thrown in at the decisive point whereverthat, might be, on sea., on land, or in the air.    Thesecond, recommendation was based on an examination of thequestion whether exception should be made to the general rule stated above in the case of the Fleet Air Arm.   Herothe Minister came to the conclusion in principle that,reversing all previous decisions, the Fleet Air Arm, thatis to say ship-borne aircraft, should b^transferred tothe Admiralty.    This proposal involved two sets of considerations:    first, was it sound or justifiable inprinciple to make the exception;    and, second, would, thealternative plan proposed, work better than the present

Herothe Minister came to the conclusion in principle that,reversing all previous decisions, the Fleet Air Arm, thatis to say ship-borne aircraft, should b^transferred tothe Admiralty.    This proposal involved two sets of considerations:    first, was it sound or justifiable inprinciple to make the exception;    and, second, would thealternative plan proposed, work better than the present-5-
system, or less well, or not at all, and at what cost?As regards the second  consideration the Cabinet were ina difficulty because they did. not know what the alterna-tive plan was.    He then said, that he must deal with bothpoints in turn.With the first point, he dealt somewhat briefly,suggesting, to the Cabinet that it could not fairly beasked to make a decision until it was more fully informed,on the second question, namely, as to what the alternative plan is .Coming to his second point he recalled, that theMinister had. suggested in his Report that the aircraft were an integral part of the ship.    This led. him to ask the question why aircraft on board Carriers were more an integral part than Army Co-operation Squadrons were an integral part of the Army in the field, and what changehad taken place in respect of the Fleet Air Arm sinceother Reports on the subject which necessitated, itsdivorce, from the royal.l Air Force.    The Secretary of Statestressed the need for co-operation and. reea.called. that itwas on this need, that Lord Balfour had. built up his recommendation in favour of the inter-penetration ofone another by the Na.vy and. the Air Force, so that officers of both forces should obtain knowledge of theother.    As the Minister for Co-ordination of defence had. sa.id, such co-operation was more important than e^eerbefore.    The Secretary of State wanted . ..     to stressthat the isolation of a section of the Air Force andi. to the Admiraltvits transfer/must reduce the common knowledge and experience of the two forces.    It must tend, to severthe Fleet Air Arm more and. more from the main stream of aviation development in research, design, technique and.strategy.   He asked the Cabinet whether it was a. wise
thing nationally or internationally to make a long and difficult  change unless it was really necessary.Nationally the immediate task was to get certain measuresof preparation done.    Internationally there was danger inmaking a serious dislocation of the Force such as must-arise in the transition period..   He pointed out that theCabinet was not at present informed, as to what was involved in the change, and. he thought that they ought not to take their decision until they knew what was involved.   He wanted first to elucidate the proposed,plan and what it would me^n in its various aspects.He noted, that the Minister in his Report (Para.7)did not allege inefficiency. On the eontmry, he said,the Force was remarkable.rka.ble for its keenness and efficiency.The Secretary of State then raised, the question ofwhat was involved in the transfer of recruiting, training and organisation to the Admiralty.   As stated on page 2of the Memorandum at.ta.ehed to CP.-199-A,  &quot;The admiralty have not yet formulated even in outline any concretescheme for giving effect to their demand&quot;.    This wasvery important, however, because costly and practicalquestions would arise which had. been exhaustivelyconsidered, hy the Balfour Committee.    The Minister hadnot yet gone into these questions.Coming to recruiting, he asked how the Fleet air arm was to be recruited.   He understood, that the personnel   pilots and maintenance staff   were to beNaval,    it was common ground, however, that sufficientNaval Officers, could, not be detailed, to the Fleet air arm, particularly if the Fleet Air Arm was increased.It would be necessary, therefore, for the Admiralty to recruit short-service flying personnel and. maintenancepersonnel,  just as the Air Force recruited, similar-7-
personnel today.   Were there then to he two recruitingorganisations recruiting air personnel in competition?And a point to which no consideration had as yet beengiven was how the difficulties of the transitional periodwere to be met.   He was informed by his legal advisersthat it was impossible to compel Royal Air Force person-nel, whether flying personnel or others, to serve in another Service, which would be a breach of contract.Tt was wrong both in equity and law.   Apart from thelegal position it would be very difficult to obtainvolunteers.Coming to the question of training, the Secretaryof State said that at present all initial training wasperformed at Royal Air Force Training Schools.    Therewere nine months&apos;  flying, training, followed by special training, which was very costly.mhe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence inter-polated that the present arrangements included, the civilian Training Schools.mhe Secretary of State for Air agreed, but. reiterat-ed. that the training was very expensive.    Great difficul-ty was encountered in fitting the training in.with the schools existing today, and it was only possible becauseof R .A .F . &quot;personnela streanywas steadily maintained and all facilities were fully used.   He asked if these costly training establish-nients were to be duplicated, and at what, stage.The Secretary of State then turned to the questionof what was to happen to disembarked aircraft crews.He recalled that much of the time of the embarkedpersonnel had to be spent, in shore aerodromes.   AtPresent they went to royal Air Force stations.    This time on shore was bound to be more expensive, involving asit did the repair and maintenance of aircraft on shoreinstead of in the ships.    This work was particularly-8-
heavy, because the facilities on board a. man-of-war orCarrier were very limited.   On shore the Air Forcemaintenance personnel and shops were available for thispurpose.   At the present time the Royal Air Force was rather short of maintenance personnel and. had. to eke out its resources in this respect.   Apart from maintenance,the crews of the Carriers did. their flying and armamenttraining on shore at Royal Air Force stations, and.probably more than half their flying time was thus spent.He asked if it was proposed that these stations, includingarmament a* &amp; training camps, were to be duplicated.    Inthat event how, he asked, were maintenance personnel to be obtained?    These problems would arise not only athome but at the various foreign stations, such as Malta,Singapore or Hong-Kong.What, he asked, was intended about the design and purchase of machines?    Tn paragraph 22 the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence had. mentioned that supply and design were not a. primary demand.    Did. it follow, however,that it was not intended to ask for this later?    If that were to happen he suggested it would involve waste of effortat a time when all manufacturing capacity had to be usedmost effectively and economically.   At present the needs in respect of supply could only be met by dovetailingeverything in carefully.   Parts of a machine might bemade by different firms, and engines were made separately from aircraft.    This applied also to all equipment, at every stage,   &quot;^hes^- processes could only properly be controlled by a. single production organisation.Turning to research and development, he askedwhether the transfer of responsibility would not carry with it a demand, and. need, for this also.   He hoped,it was not. proposed, that there should be a duplication-9-
of the establishments at Farnhorough and Martlesham.At present tests were going on all the time whilemachines were being developed to a state of efficiency.The next point, was as to how reserves of pilots forthe Fleet Air Arm were to be provided.    This was not mentioned in the Report, but was a. vital point.   were there to be two reserves, one for the Royal Air Forceand one for the Fleet Air Arm?   At present the AirForce reserve was available for both.    Were there to beseparate Volunteer Reserve Training Centres?   How, he asked, would, all this work in war?    It was  clear that,transfer must imply a great deal of duplication,^o what would it amount, and what would be the cost?He thought it right to put all these points as otherwise the Cabinet  could not decide whether a better scheme was likely to be drawn up or not.    If, however, the sever-ance was to be partial an^ not  complete, there would,still be much duplication and. cost.   All these factorshad been considered exhaustively by the Balfour Commit-tee before its decision was reached.    Lord Ealfonr said,in his Report that they had been most  careful to draw the line at the point where there would be the leastfriction and. the best prospect of co-operation with aminimum of overlapping.   Before a decision was reached,the Cabinet must know the scheme, its implications, itspracticability, its  cost, and where the present system could be improved, and if the new system would be better.He suggested, therefore, that the Admiralty shouldproduce their plan, and he gave an absolute undertaking that the Air Ministry would give it full considerationwith an unprejudiced, mind.    As an earnest of this he recalled that, the Air Ministry had. accepted, at once therecommendations which the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence had made as to pilots, etc., daring an earlierInquiry, &quot;What he wanted, as much as anyone was finality:but the decision must be right in principle and workablein practice.   He asked the Cabinet to say that, it was-10-
not reasonable to agree in principle to a scheme that no-one had seen and. which, therefore, no-one could, appraise.The Home Secretary, as a formerSecretary of State for Air and until recently FirstLord of the Admiralty, offered some observations.He asked the Cabinet to remember that Lord Balfourand Lord Salisbury had both admitted that theexisting scheme was of an experimental character and that as the Air Force grew, it might have to bere considered.     At that time, the severance of theFleet Air Arm from the Air Force would have beendisastrous owing to the smallness of the Royal AirForce, which probably had not numbered more than 200machines.      This was especially the case as the army would probably have urged the severance of the army co-Operation Squadrons.      The position was totally different now when we were aiming at some 2,000first line Royal Air Force machines.      It was not a .question of creating a new Air Force under theAdmiralty.      The number of machines involved wouldprobably not much exceed 500.      The position,therefore, was totally changed since that of previousinquiries.     His view was that the Royal Air Forceought to be glad to be quit of these Naval units which must be a nuisance to them,and that the RoyalAir Force, as a whole, would not be affected.      Ithad to be remembered also that the Navies ,    of theother Powers had their own Fleet Air Arms.      TheUnited States of America Navy had made more progressin technical and operational aviation than we had.Their machines were better and every United States&apos;-11-
Naval Officer was to have some kind of air training.He hoped that in time the Navy would reach a similarposition hut this was not practicable as long as the personnel were not members of a single Service.     Thiswas illustrated by the failure of volunteers from theNavy for the Fleet Air Arm.     At the present time, therewas a shortage of 50 pilots*The Secretary of State for Air said this wasnot quite accurate.     There was a shortage of Navalpilots owing to the insistence of the Admiralty on recruiting up to the full TO per cent.      The Air Force,however, could supply the deficiency.The Home Secretary said that unfortunately theRoyal Air Force had not been able to carry out theirobligation to give their pilots 4 years service in theFleet Air Arm.     Many of the pilots only served therefor 18 months.The Secretary of State for Air admitted this,but said that, on the recommendation of the Minister forCo-Grdination of Defence, the Air Ministry had agreed toextend the period of service.The Home Secretary continued that if the numberof Royal Air Force pilots was increased,  the flyingknowledge in the Fleet would be restricted pro rata.Whether they were right or wrong, volunteers would not come forward from the Navy unless a change was made.He admitted that the details mentioned by the Secretaryof State for Air were important but they ought to be dealtwith by the two Departments with the assistancelof theMinister for Co-Ordination of Defence when the principle
had been decided by the Cabinet.      He believed thata scheme could be worked out without involving thecreation of a separate Air Force which no-one wantedand without endangering the position of the Air force or separating supply from the Air Ministry, which mustbe avoided at all cost.     When he went to the Admiralty,he had tried to quieten down this controversy but hehad found it impossible..The Chancellor of the Exchequer said thatif he were to approach the question from thedepartmental Treasury view, he ought to ask that beforeadopting and announcing a change, there should be a delayduring which the details of the scheme could be worked out and an opinion could be   formed   as to whether itwould result in heavy expenditure or not.     As a memberof the Cabinet, however, he could not take that view.After this prolonged examination by the Minister forCo-Ordination of Defence, whose office had been createdto solve such questions, he felt that the question must be settled at once.     Moreover, there were anumber of disagreeable accompaniments to the controversywhich had been taken up by the Press.     He could not see,therefore, how the Cabinet could separate withoutreaching a conclusion. Though he apprehended that some extra expenditure would be involved in the change,he believed the new decision to be for the best.He did not regard it as inconsistent with previousdecisions,.    As the Home Secretary had mentioned, therehad formerly been a danger of breaking up the Air Force
Illbut now that Force was In a secure position with anessential role to fulfil in National Defence.     Theonly apprehension he had was lest the sense of sorenessshould be shifted from one Force to the other.       Thatwould prove a real weakness.     He admired and shared the belief of the Secretary of State for Air in theadvantages of co-operation and he believed that with his influence this could be achieved.     Any postponement would leave the Cabinet in a state of doubt andhesitation.     From the political point of view thatwould be a serious matter.     Since, therefore, theprinciple had been gone into so carefully, a decisionought to be taken.      He would, however, first like toknow the view of the Minister for Co-Ordination ofDefence on some of the details mentioned by the Secretaryof State for Air.     Admittedly, there was at present no scheme.     He would like to know if the Minister thoughthe could work out with the Departments a satisfactory scheme.      Subject to this, he shared the views of theHome Secretary.The Secretary of State for War said that theGeneral Staff supported the principle of the Ministerfor Co-Ordination&apos;s Report.      He agreed that the subsidiary points required investigation, but he did notthink they were insoluble.     He emphasised the difficultiesof changing over a man from one Service to another.      Inthe Army the personnel could not be shifted even from oneregiment to another.     He attached special importance to
the Hone Secretaryrs view because he had been at thehead of both the Departments concerned.     The nextstep was for the Admiralty to evolve a scheme.The Minister for Go-Ordination of Defence,at the request of the Prime Minister, offered someobservations on the points of detail.     He emphasised,however, that these were only a few ideas picked outin passing from the memoranda submitted to him.     Onthe broad question of the change-over, he consideredthat this was not a matter of months but must takeyears.      The process would have to be pursued in stages.      The Cabinet were aware that the Admiraltyat present indented on the Air Ministry for aeroplanesand that the Admiralty reimbursed the Air Ministry forthe machines supplied.     Any increase in the Force,however, involved a great increase in the Votes of theAir Ministry for training and other over-headexpenseSo      Consequently, the Admiralty was inc 1a position to increase the Air Ministry&apos;s Votes.If the transfer took effect, there would be a transfer-to the Admiralty of heavy charges on the Air Vote,He did not suppose the Treasury would allow anunlimited expenditure by the Admiralty on the fleet air Arm,      The Navy, therefore, would have to relateits expansion to other forms of expenditure so as toproduce a balanced Fleet.     There would be everyinducement to the Admiralty, therefore, to keep theexpenditure as low as possible and the interests of economy would be served.
It was his view that research and experiment mustbe conducted by the Air Ministry.      In the matter ofsupplies there must be much closer liaison, than at present,and he thought that this could be arranged.      Turning torecruiting,    he said that the Admiralty would, appoint a certain number of regular Naval Officers, who would either volunteer or be told off to this service.      Theywould also appoint observers,  some of whom possibly might in the near future be naval ratings.      These would haveto be supplemented by short-service naval officers.How were these to be obtained?He recalled that Public School candidates for theNavy and Army at present appeared before a Civil ServiceBoard.      They expressed a preference for one Service orthe other, which so far as possible they were allowed toexercise.      He saw no difficulty in allowing candidates for a short-term service in the Navy to go before theBoard, a third option being allowed for this Service.In order to supply the necessary reserves some kind of auxillary Service,  comparable, mutatis mutandis,  to theR.N.R., might be necessary,      Elementary training might take place at the civilian schools, and secondary training at the Air Force schools.     For specialised trainingNaval schools would be necessary.      It might be possibleto allot certain of the existing schools, or parts ofthem, to the Fleet Air Arm for specialised &quot;training.The Secretary of State for Air suggested that*general training should be carried out in the training schools.     He asked, however, how the men landed from
ships were to be dealt with. At some of the stationsabroad, at places like Malta and Hong-Kong,where therewas little space for aerodromes,  it would be impossibleto duplicate stations.     Moreover, if they wereduplicated they would be out of use when the ships were away.      Was it proposed at these stations training should be conducted at R.A.F. aerodromes?The Minister for Co-ordination of Defencesuggested that this could be arranged as a matter ofco-operation at home.      For example, at Gosport, wherethere was an aerodrome already used for training Fleetobservers, the position would be easier, particularlyin a period of expansion such as at present when newaerodromes were being created.In the training of aircraft -maintenance personnelthe present position was that the unskilled work wasperformed by the Navy and the skilled v/ork by the RoyalAir Force.      At the existing Admiralty establishments,however, most elaborate mechanical training was carriedout,  and it would certainly be possible to super-impose on to these establishments a training for theneeds of the Fleet Air Arm.      Moreover,  these establishments would turn out men who were capable of doing mechanical work for the ship as well as for theaircraft.      By thus training men for general purposesan economy would be effected.      The above were only the broad lines.      It was not possible at present to draw up rapidly a complete and fully &quot;costed&quot; scheme.      Theprocess would be a long one requiring years.      Thenumbers of aircraft involved would be larger than the
500 machines mentioned hy the Home Secretary, for thenumber of aircraft carriers was being increased to 11, someof which were rather smaller than the existing types.The other members -af the Cabinet, including the lord president of the Council, the Lord Chancellor, the Ministerof Health, the Secretary cf State for Dominion Affairs, andthe President of the Board of Education, then expressed theirviews which were unanimously in favour of the Report of theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence.The Secretary of State for Air thanked the cabinet for the fair consideration they had given to this subject.Though he did not think the decision a right one he was not one of those who favour the formal recording of dissent,and he had always held the view that every Service must accept the decision of the Cabinet.      The suggestions of theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence were valuable and ought to be on record.      He emphasised two points:    first,that abroad the aircraft landed from the Fleet for trainingmust go to Air Force stations, and in such cases the controlmust be exercised by the Royal Air Force Commanding Officer^The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said hethought that would be necessary.The Secretary of State for Air, continuing,  said hissecond point was that as a matter of principle all aircraft operated from the shore should fall within the responsibility*?f the Air Ministry,     In the fullness of time much morenaval work would be done from the shore than was    thecase to-day.      If in the future the S*M3a&amp; General Staff
decided that certain sea units should &quot;be replaced by landunits these must be Air Force units.The Minister fnv Go-ordination of Defence agreedoThe Secretary of State for Air said that he had madethe point because there was an idea prevalent in the AirForce that the necessary demand for the transfer of theFleet Air Arm to the Admiralty was a first step towardsobtaining necessary control of all shore-based aircraft.He added that the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence had helped him by assuring the Cabinet thatresearch,  experiment, development and supply would remain with the Air Ministry.     He would do his utmost to carrythis out.      If an announcement was to be made he hopedthat it would cover the whole subject, and that it would bemade quite clear as to what responsibilities rested withthe Royal Air Force and what with the Fleet.The Prime Minister said that he did not wish to repeat the arguments of his colleagues.      He agreed generally  with their conclusions.      The present conditionseould not be allowed to continue.     He was referring not somuch to the matter of efficiency but to the feeling betweenthe Services.      If there were no decision now the public would not understand the position. Every member of theCabinet appreciated the manner in which the Secretary ofState for Air had received a decision which must be mostdistasteful to him.     His attitude was a reflection of thespirit which ought to exist between the Defence Services,and for the matter of that between members of the Cabinet.He thought that a statement ought to be made on the subject
before the House rose.There was hardly time to prepareit for the same day, but it should be made tomorrow.     he agreed with the Secretary of State for Air that it must be suffiently comprehensive to cover all aspects of thequestion.      When a change-over was made he hoped that itwculd be treated in a co-operative spirit, which he thoughthad not been so conspicuous in the Admiralty as in theAir Ministry.      He asked the First Lord of the Admiralty todo his utmost to avoid any manifestations of triumph inhis Department, and to urge that the Navy should devoteitself to co-operation.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the Report of the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence on theFleet Air Arm (CP.  199 (37)), the main recommendations of which involve -(i)   Transfer from the Air Ministry tothe Admiralty of responsibilityfor the organisation and administration **f the Fleet air arm, that is to say,  of all ship-borne aircraft:(ii)    Retention by the Air Ministry ofresponsibility for shore-based aircraft employed on naval duties in co-operation with the Navy,which should continue to form partof the Royal Air Force.    provision must be made for specialisedtraining of the forces allotted tothese duties:(b) That the Admiralty and the Air Ministry,with such assistance as they may require frorthe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence,should work out a scheme for carrying outthe above conclusions.      The scheme should provide for the t-ransfer involved in(a)(i) by stages,  and should take intoaccount the following principles,  whichcommended themselves to the Cabinet.-(i)   Responsibility for research,experiment, development and supplyof aircraft and equipment should rest with the Air Ministry, but arrangements must be made for closeliaison on these matters betweenthe two Departments:
(ii)    The arrangements for the use of royal Air Force aerodromes byunits of the Fleet Air Arm senton shore for training purposesfrom ships in harbour (whichwill often be necessary especially at ports abroad) must be made ona basis of co-operation betweenthe two Services, but the command and control must remain with theRoyal Air Force:(iii)    If in future it should be foundadvisable to replace units of sea-borne aircraft in whole or in. part by shore-based aircraft for naval purposes, the responsibilityfor these units should rest withthe Air Ministry:That the Cabinet rely on the Navy and theAir Force to work out and apply the above decisions in that spirit of cordial co-operation,  which is essential to thesuccess of any combined effort of the kind:That the Prime Minister should on Friday,July 30th, announce the above decisions,and that the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence should draft the announcementfor the Prime Minister&apos;s consideration in terms sufficiently comprehensive toleave no d.doubt as to the responsibility to be assigned to the Admiralty and AirMinistry respectively.
ARRANGEMENTSFOR the recess .(previous reference:Cabinet 31(37), Con-clusion 15.)2. The Prime Minister said he was not proposing to fix the date of the next. Meeting of the Cabinet, whichwould probably take place early in October unless someemergency arose in the interval.    The Secretary to theCabinet. would keep a list of the addresses of members .He himself would have to be guided, by circumstances ifquestions should arise for decision.   He only proposed,to summon a full Meeting of the Cabinet in the event ofimportant questions of policy arising.    Otherwise hewould summon those Ministers within easy reach of LondonHe must have discretion in this matter, and. was anxious that, all should have a good holiday.   As this was thefinal Meeting of the Cabinet before the Recess he took the opportunity to thank all his  colleagues for thesupport, they had given.   He felt, that every member ofthe Cabinet had. done something to contribute to the good,name of the Government.( The Prime Minister, withdrew at this point,in order to visit the Fine.&apos;As the Chancellor of the Exchequer was involved in the question which followed,the Prime Minister asked the Lord Presidentof the Council to take the Chair.The Lord President   complied with this request.)
AiR RAID 5    ^ke Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thes5rVTCES?N Home Secretary (C.P.-201 (37)) on the subject ofT-  -m^o       Air Raid Precautions Expenditure, to which he attachedNegotiationsith Local.horities.       a verbatim note of a Meeting which the Secretary ofState for Scotland and. himself had. had with repre-(Previous&apos;Reference&apos; sentatives of Local Authorities   Associations,in cabinet 29(37), Con-        pursuance of the Conclusion mentioned, m the margin.elusion 7.) ./Via,   The proposal put to that Meeting, viz., that maddition to the commitments already undertaken by theGovernment, the Government should, pay 50 per cent. ofthe expenditure, both recurring and. non-recurring, on air raid precautions services, representing over thewhole field an estimated contribution of 70 per cent.,had. proved unacceptable by the Local Authorities, who held the view that it was the duty of the State to bear the whole financial responsibility.    It was clear,therefore, that if agreement was to be reached it wouldbe necessary to make some new offer substantially morefavourable to the Local Authorities , and in his Memo-randum the Secretary of State suggested, for considera-tion three alternative schemes, describing the effectof each.The Home Secretary made a statement in amplifiea-tion of his Memorandum.   Of the three alternativessubmitted for consideration in paragraph 6 he preferred.B. and. C., which were based on acceptance by the centralGovernment of the principle of responsibility for capitalexpenditure, leaving expenditure on maintenance, in thecase of alternative B., to Local Authorities, and. inthe case of alternative C. to the Local authorities with a grant in aid. from the central Government. Asbetween B. and. C, he thought it. would prove necessaryto agreement to make a grant in aid to maintenance costs,,so he preferred C.
He laid great stress on the danger of further delay,especially in the case of London, and asked for authorityfor manoeuvre on the basis  of his proposals .    His view was supported by the consideration that it would hardly be possible to pass a controversial Bill in the Autumnagainst the views of the Local Authorities.    In any eventa Eill was necessary, especially in Scotland, where powersdid not exist for carrying out the necessary measures ofprecaution.   He indicated the lines of a statement hewould like to make in Parliament before the end. of the session, as to future procedure (See Conclusion (b)).The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that it wasonly ten days ago that, the Local Authorities,  in spite ofa. most persuasive speech by the Home Secretary, had rejected the proposals of the Cabinet.   He questioned whether it was sound to retreat from the position thentaken up to a much lower position.   He thought it not.improbable that there was a large element of bluff inthe attitude of the Local Authorities .   He supported, thisby references to the attitude of the -Vestminster city council, who were reported, to have decided, to proceedwith an air raid precautions scheme in full confidence that they would be reimbursed for a fair share of their expenditure, as well as to the attitude of the Conserva-tive Parliamentary Air Committee, who had. repudiated theidea of no contribution by the Local Authorities.The Home Secretary pointed out that at the same time they had said. that, the Government must increase their offer.The Chancellor of the Exchequer,  continuing todevelop his argument against the immediate adoption ofthe Home Secretary&apos;s proposals, pointed, out that much ofthe expenditure involved in air raid precautions couldnot be controlled by the central authorities. This applied
to some of the capital expenditure, e.g., the alterationsto existing buildings, or nev.&apos; construction.    If theGovernment paid, the whole, the Home Office or some otherDepartment must establish elaborate machinery of control,or the Government would, be at. the mercy of the LocalAuthorities, who had no incentive for economy.   Admittedlythere were other parts of the expenditure which theGovernment really could control, such as provision of fire equipment and. appliances;    but as a general proposi-tion the idea of all the capital expenditure falling tothe central authority was alarming.   He admitted that he himself had. suggested, an examination of the principle ofcapital expenditure falling to the State, and. maintenance expenditure to the Local Authorities with or without a.subsidy;    but when it was examined, in detail he could,only reject it.   He asked, therefore, that the cabinet should not take a decision that day between the alterna-tives suggested by the Home Secretary.    The right course,he suggested, was that the Home Secretary should, givethe answer he had a.lrea.dy suggested as to future procedure(See ,conclusion (b)) I    that he should announce that aBill would be required and that the Bill would be discussed with the Local Authorities.   He was willing to agree to a&apos;proposal made by the Home Secretary that Local authorities which had already incurred expenditure on air raid pre-caution schemes should be reimbursed retrospectively to january, 1937,    In the meanwhile any possible action should be taken to sound. Local Authorities in order toas certain whether some of them, at any rate, were not willing to incur part of the cost.The Minister of Health recognised the difficultiesof the Home Secretary&apos;s task, as he had had similar difficulties in connection with the-^a^wa^R^ek^Tribunal^-25-
His suggestion was that the Home Secretary should notnowask/for a decision on the principle, but should give theproposed answer on the Bill and should take soundingsamong Local Authorities.   He himself could give theHome Secretary a list of/Local Authorities who werehlikely to recognise their proper obligations.The Secretary of State for Scotland, agreed, with theMinister of Health.The Home Secretary repeated that, he was much con-cerned. with the risk of losing more time.    The illustra-tion of the Jestminster City Council was not of much importance, because Borough Councils had not the powerto assist very much.    That power rested with the LondonCounty Council.   He was anxious to avoid a prolonged,controversy.   He was willing, however, to accept theproposals that had been made, but suggested that liberty of manoeuvre should be left to the Chancellor of theExchequer and himself in ease an opportunity arose duringthe Recess for closing with a favourable offer.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That no decision should be taken atthis Meeting on the principle of a modified financial offer to LocalAuthorities:(b) That the Home Secretary should beauthorised to announce the seme after-noon that an Air Raid Precautions Billwoul^ be necessary in the autumn:    thatthe Bill would first be discussed withthe Local Authorities and that he hoped to reach agreement;    also that LocalAuthorities which had incurred expenditurein connection with their approved schemes would be reimbursed as from January 1, 1937:( c) That authority should be delegated, tothe Home Secretary, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, the
Secretary of State for Scotland, theMinister of Health and any other ministers whom they might think itdesirable to consult, to take advantageof any opportunity that might offer forconcluding a favour-able financialarrangement with Local authorities as the result of soundings which theHome Secretary had agreed to make.
LONG-TERMAGRICULTURALPOLICY.Milk Policy.(previous reference:Cabinet 32 (37)Conclusion 10,;4.     In accordance with the decision referredto in the margin, the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries communicated a revised version ofparagraph 13 of Appendix I to CcP. 195 (37)(reproduced in Appendix I), which had been agreedto by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and himself.The Cabinet accepted the-re-draft for incorporation in the White Paper-
PALESTINE.The Mufti of jerusalem.(previous reference:Cabinet 32 (37)Conclusion 12.)- *  7.5.     The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs, on behalf of the Secretary of State forthe Colonies, read a telegram which had alreadybeen circulated to the Cabinet from theSecretary of State to the High Commissioner forPalestine (No. CO.433 (37)) despatched at  .45 p.m. on the 27th July on the subject of theproposed arrest of the Mufti.     He also handed round copies of the reply of the HighCommissioner dated the 29th July (Appendix II),The passage in the reply on which he wished fora decision of the Cabinet was the following:-&quot;Police continue to guard the gatesof the old city and they have orders to arrest the Mufti if he should appear.     The Mufti has howevertaken alarm, and as he is by naturetimid he is remaining in sanctuary.I hope that when nothing is done toexcite his fears he will give policea chance to arrest him outside hissanctuary, but for the present it is unlikely that he will come out ofhis home.     I quite understand thatthere should be no enticement.&quot;He pointed out that the policy involved inthese telegrams was one of arresting the Muftiif the opportunity arose.In the course of a short discussion,it was suggested that the policy should bemaintained, but that it would be advisable to relaxth* arrangements forwatehing the Mufti, in which case he might emerge from his concealment and give an opportunity for his arrest.The Cabinet agreed:That the policy of arrestingand deporting the Mufti, if andwhen opportunity should offer,should be adhered to, but withoutusing any form of enticement.
defence expenditure.(previous reference:Cabinet 27(37) Con-clusion . 3 . )6,    The Chancellor of the Ibcchequer said that hehad been asked by the Prime Minister to make beforethe Recess a Report to the Cabinet on the presentposition on Defence Expenditure.      He recalled that atthe meeting held on 30th June the Cabinet approved generally his proposals in CP. 165 (37) that theDefence Departments should be asked in consultationwith the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence,(i) to estimate anew the period of time required for the completion of their programmes,(ii) on the basis of the programme as nowsanctioned and of the rising trend ofprices to submit estimates of their total requirements of voted money yearby year during that period,  and(iii) on the like basis to submit estimates of their normal total annual -expenditure in the years following the completion of the programme.Subsequent to this meeting the Chancellor,after consultation with the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence, wrote to the three Defence Ministers on12th July asking them to submit these general estimatesto the Treasury, and to show not merely the cost oftheir programmes on the basis now sanctioned, but alsowhat the cost would be on the hypothesis that the additions to these programmes now under discussion were authorised.      The Air Ministry had alreadysubmitted their return.      Furtner, a meeting haft beenheld between representatives of the Treasury and of theDefence Departments at which agreement had been reached on the form of the returns and the particulars to beincluded in them.     As regards time-table, arrangements
had been made which would ensure that the wholepicture, including the comments of the Treasury on theDepartments returns, should be completed and availablefor consideration by the appropriate ministerial committee by an early date in October.That was the position which had been reached inthis matter.The Prime Minister had also asked him, however,to make a Report as to the Treasury1s tentative and provisional estimates of the kind of amounts involved.Although the full figures had not yet been receivedsufficient particulars were now available to show thatthe cost of maintenance of the Defence Forces aftercompletion -of the programme, without talcing intoaccount any additions to the programme not yetauthorised but under consideration, seemed likely to constitute a permanent financial burden which wasaltogether beyond what this country could find fromrevenue.     While it was too early to indicate what thefigure for the annual maintenance of the forces    on completion of the programme would be, on present information it seemed likely that the figure might beas high as  240 millions as compared with the figure of 150/ 170 millions given in paragraph 3 of cp. 165 (37) as the total amount likely to be availablefor the maintenance of our enlarged programme when thefive years are over.At the moment when the Cabinet was dispersing forthe Recess he thought it right to communicate thesefigures to his colleagues.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.,29th July, 1937.

APPENDIX II.CYPHER TELEGRAM from the High Commissioner for palestine to the  Secretary of State for the Colonies.Dated 29th July, 1937.     Received 2.22 a.m., 29th July.MOST IMMEDIATE.Private and Personal.Your private and personal telegram of 27th Julyfollowing for Parkinson begins.      Present position relat-ing to the Mufti is still as reported in my secret tele-grams Nos. 357 and 358.      The Mufti continues to live inhis Hararn house and there to hold meetings of the higher committee with&apos;resultant intrigues against government policy.      His liberty of action and his power to spreadsubversive propaganda against Government is not diminishedby his remaining in his Haram house.Police continue to guard the gates of the oldcity and they have orders to arrest the Mufti if he should appear.      The Mufti has however taken alarm, and as he isby nature timid he is remaining in sanctuary.      I hopethat when nothing is done to excite his fears he will givepolice a chance to arrest him outside his sanctuary, butfor the present it is unlikely that he will come out ofhis home.      I quite understand that there should be noenticement.I adhere to my opinion previously expressed thatbest course to adopt is to deport the Mufti.      To removeMufti from office and to allow him to remain in thecountry will not be decisive against him by any meansbecause although deposed he could still carry on hisintrigues in person throughout the country.     v/ith regardto your enquiries on two specific points:  (i) I consider-1-
that the Mufti&apos;s prestige was slightly diminished on accountof his continued concealment in his house, because the criticism was made that his action in slipping away wasnot that of a courageous leader but the effect of this criticism has not been great.      The failure of Governmentto arrest the Mufti does not appear to have caused any loss of prestige but i fear considerable criticism willbe roused if time passes and Government is unable to takev stepsany (group omitted) against the Mufti.      (ii) oppositionto partition is now so widespread and has hardened tosuch an extent that I doubt whether there is in fact muchmoderate opinion at the present moment to be voiced on thesubject even if reprisals were feared.      It should be understood that criticism and discussion is directed atpresent more in regard to the boundaries proposed by theRoyal Commission than towards actual principle of partitionwhich many think or pretend to think is dead.
