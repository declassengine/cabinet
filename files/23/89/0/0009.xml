I.    The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that,in viev: of the absence of the First Lord of theAdmiralty, he had instructed the Secretary to communi-cate the decision of the Cabinet referred to in the margin   in regard to the BASILISK Communique, to theSecretary to the Admiralty, who had sent a reply.At the request of the Prime Minister, the Secretaryinformed the Cabinet that the Secretary to the admiralty had notified to all concerned the Cabinet decision thatCommuniques which have a political significance are notto be issued without consultation with the Foreign Office,He had observed, however, that the principle was a.lreadywell understood in the Department.   He then read thefollowing extract from the Secretary to the Admiralty&apos;s&quot;In this particular ca.se the communiquewas authorised by the First Sea. Lord, andhe asks me to explain that, in consideringthe matter on the day in question, theForeign Office were twice consulted overthe telephone regarding the proposed termsof the communique.

The Prime Minister recalled the circumstances inwhich the House of Commons had appointed a SelectCommittee on Procedure relating to Money Resolutions.The Select Committee had now reported, and on the re-ass embly of Parliament Questions were being addressedto him as to what action the Government proposed totake.   After giving some particulars of discussionshe had had on the subject with the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Parliamentary Secretary to theTreasurjr, and of their objections to the DeclaratoryResolution proposed in paragraph 16 of the Committee&apos;sReport, he read the text of a draft Answer which^ ifthe Cabinet approved, he would make in the House ofCommons the following a.fternoon.The Cabinet approved the terms of thedraft Answer as set forth in the Appondj.x.*
SPAIN AND THE The Cabinet had before them a Note by theMEDITERRANEAN.Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-244 (37))(Previous circulating an appreciation of the situation in SpainReference:Cabinet 37 written by Mr G.H.Thompson, First Secretary at Hisr(37) , Con-clusion lo) Majesty&apos;s Embassy, first at Valencia and. more recently the NON- at Hendaye.intervention committee. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who,(Previous in the absence of the Earl of Plymouth, had taken the reference:Cabinet 37       Chair at the Non-intervention Committee on the previous(37), Con-clusion 1.)      day, reported that, in spite of long discussions, no progress was m8.de and. the Committee was threatened witha complete deadlock.      In order to give the Cabinet anopportunity to review the situation, he had adjournedthe Meeting until this afternoon.This morning there had been a fresh development.The French Ambassador had reported that the FrenchGovernment viewed with grave concern the possibilityof a breakdown of the Committee before the British andFrench Governments were agreed on what they should, doin that event.    The Ambassador had raised the question before, but the Secretary of Sta.te had explained thedifficulties from the point of view of public opinion in this country.    The Ambassador had stated that theopening of the French frontier with our acquiescencebut without some positive corresponding action on our part would not be sufficient and might only lead to avery grave European situation.   He had asked, therefore,for some joint action of a positive kind.   The Secretaryof State gathered that what the French wanted in the contingency contemplated was that in some form or other^ we should allow the sale of arms to the Government of spain.   He himself had given no encouragement to this idea, but he realised that if no action were taken a dangerous situation would arise in Europe.   The French
Government appreciated the British Government1sdifficulties and wanted to gain time to enable the twoGovernments to discuss the matter.   With this in view,the Ambassador had in mind that the proposals now before the Non-intervention Committee, which closelyresembled those made by the British Government last july, should be forwarded to the two parties in Spain,in the meantime the Am.ba.ss ado io hoped that the Britishand French Governments would jointly discuss their future attitude.    This was not a definite proposal from the French Government, but was the course that the;Ambassador would like to adopt.    If the suggestion was acceptable, the French Government proposed that theFrench Ambassador should advance it at the Non-intervention Committee.In reply to a question the Secretary of State saidthat there was one modification in the position since his Majesty&apos;s Government had made their proposals inJuly, namely, that the Italian Government now agreedto &quot;token&quot; withdrawals on a man-for-man basis ,althoughthe French proposal was for a withdrawa.1 proportionate to the strength of volunteers on the two sides.   Themore the &quot;token&quot; force was enlarged, the greaterbecame the danger for the Spanish Government forces,owing to the preponderance of Italian forces.The Prime Minister pointed out that general franco&apos;s superiority would not become any greaterbecause an equa.1 number of forces were withdrawn from either side.    It wovxld remain exactIj the same,except to the extent that (as pointed out by theLord Chancellor) the proportion of volunteers inthe contending armies would be altered by thewithdrawal.
In favour of the proposition of withdrawals from both sides on a man-for-man basis, it was pointed outthat the policy of His Majesty1 s Government was tosecure the withdrawal of all foreign volunteers from spain.    If a considerable number could be withdrawnfrom both sides until one side had no volunteers atall, it would be much harder for the nations which still had volunteers on the other side to refuse towithdraw them.    In addition, once withdrawals started on any basis there would be little risk of the arrival of fresh volunteers.   An even greater advantage wouldbe the break in the present deadlock and a beginning ofthe withdraws.! of volunteers.    It was pointed out alsothat withdrawal on a man-for-man basis would result ina large reduction of the Italian forces with general franco and greatly diminish the risk, in the event ofa Franco victory,, of Italian control over the Govern-ment of Spain.The Cabinet were reminded, however, that the policyof a man-for-man withdrawal would be unpopular withthe Spanish Government for two reasons:    first, thatit would, reduce the foreign element in their forcesproportionately more than in General Franco&apos;s;    and,second,    that     the withdrawal was to be the precursorof the application of belligerent rights, which wouldbe a still greater disadvantage.The Secretary of State for Air pointed out that although it might be possible to secure the withdrawal,of infantry, a much greater difficulty would arise for both sides in the case of specialists, and. especially of airmen, as there were not many Spaniards capable ofair fighting.
The Prime Minister summed up this part of thediscussion to the effect that the suggestion to put to the two parties in Spain the proposals now beforethe lion-Intervention Committee was a useful one.    Itwould enable the Non-intervention Committee to be adjourned without a breakdown, and give time for furthereons consideration.The Lord President of the Council raised thequestion as to whether it would not be worth while for the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to try and arrange for a talk with the representatives ofFrance, Germany and Italy, without the presence of theRussian representative, whose influence always appearedadverse to agreement.   For example, the foreign secretary might, perhaps at the end. of a Meeting, askthose three representatives to stay behind, his object being to suggest that, in view of the very gravedangers of the present situation, the four Powers should,agree to try and induce and, if necessary, to compel the two parties to the Spanish struggle to come to terms on the basis of a Government in Spain which wouldbe neither Communist, nor Fascist.   As part of thispolicy he tlioucht it should be made plain to theItalian Government that we did not want a communist government any more than they did.The Prime Minister pointed out that the-ItalianGovernment had not committed itself to a Fascist Spain,but only to the prevention of a Communist Spain.The Secretary of State for War, while anxious notto break our solidarity with France, suggested thatthe circumstances were now such that that solidarityought to be maintained on our own terms.   We ought to persuade the French to accept the Italian Ambassador&apos;sman-for-man proposal, and &quot;call his bluff&quot; if it wasnot a. genuine one.
The Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs saidthat he had pressed, the French on the matter of &quot;token&quot;withdrawals, and they might agree to that;    but theywould not agree to it without acceptance of the other proposals put forward.   He liked the Lord. President&apos;proposal and would try to find an opportunity to followit up.Some discussion then took pla.ee as to the Frenchsuggestion that, in the event of a failure of thelion-Intervention Committee, we should in some way sellarms to the Spanish Government.    It was urged that,from a. political point of view, we could, not sell tothe Government without selling to General Franco&apos;aside also.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat, from the point of view of the French Government,the argument would be advanced, that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had und.erts.keii not to supply arms except to Governments.    If belligerent rights were grantedthey could sell to both sides;     until they were granted, however, they ought to sell to the SpanishGovernment.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence pointedout that we could, not be forced to sell arms to anyone.In any event the amount of new war material that couldbe spared was so small as to make the question academic.The Prime Minister said, that from a political pointof view it would not be possible to differentiate between the Government and. General Franco.   He suggest-ed that the right course would be to tell the French .Ambassador that at the present stage we were notprepared to agree to send supplies to the SpanishGovernment only in the event of a breakdown of thenon-intervention agreement.   He proposed to include
the words &quot;at the present stage&quot; in order to avoid makingdifficulties with the French Government, but he did not want to encourage them to think that we should be prepared to agreeto it lat er.The discussion on the sale of war material led to theopening of the question as to what would be the government&apos;s policy in the event of a breakdown of the non-interventionagreement.The Prime Minister pointed out that the French plan of opening the frontier and combining with it a large sale ofarms to the Spanish Government  could only result in disaster,as it would be followed by open intervention on the other sideon a greatly extended scale.It was suggested that Franco would benefit more than theSpanish Government by the opening of the frontier, sinceItaly, who possessed greater resources than France at thepresent time, would feel justified in sending help to Francoon a large scale.The Lord Chancellor suggested that the Italians mightsend ships to stop the importation of arms to the SpanishGovernment.    In that event the arms could only reach their destination under escort, and this might easily lead tofighting.The Prime Minister said, that a complete breakdown must be avoided if it were in any way possible, and. we ought to avoiddiscussing that eventuality and. concentrate on trying to finda way out.   The Cabinet could rely on the Foreign Secretaryto do his best in this direction.The Cabinet agreed.  (a) To authorise the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to accept the suggestion that the french representative should make a proposal at the Non-intervention Committee to the effect that the french proposals now before that Committee should, bereferred to the two parties to the Spanish dispute:(b) That the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should tell the French Ambassador that at the present stage His Majesty&apos;s Government were not prepared toadopt the proposal of the French Governmentthat in the event of a failure of the
non-intervention policy they shouldsupply arris to Spain:(e) To continue to do our utmost to maintainthe policy of non-intervention, and inthe meantime to reserve the question ofwhat action should he taken in the eventof a breakdown of that policy:(d) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should consider the practicability of carrying out the proposal of the lord president of the Council, marked &quot;A&quot; onpage 6.-9-
THE PAR EAST. 4.   The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsJapan and recalled that he had circulated to members of the china.Cabinet the telegram sent to the United States&apos; of(Previous America as a result of the previous discussion.   reference:Cabinet 37        had also exchanged private telegrams with Mr Norman(37), Con-elusion 5.)       Davis, who was to be the American representative atFR.^^(y/)Lt.   the forthcoming Conference.   He was doing everythinghe could to try and induce the Japanese to be repre-sented at the Conference, which would be held at brussels on October 30th.   The procedure of the Confer-ence would depend to a considerable extent on whetherthey cane or not.   He thought that the most usefulresult of the Conference would be if one or two orthree Powers were to be charged to mediate, and he hoped that the task might be entrusted to the UnitedKingdom and the United States of America.Some discussion took place as to the line to betaken by Government speakers in the forthcoming debates in both Houses of Parliament.The Prime Minister suggested that the situation hadundergone considerable change.    It was  clear now thatthe Government of the United States of America had no intention of taking any decisive action in the Par East .1The original apprehensions of the Cabinet lest theyshould urge sanctions without, undertaking responsibility]for the consequences, or, alternatively, lay the blameon us for not applying sanctions, had not developed.He thought, therefore, that the main line of the speeches should be to present the object of the Confer-ence as appeasement.    If that were set forth as theobject, there was no need to discuss the eventualityof failure- or to raise questions of sanctions.
THE PAR EAST.     5. The Minister for Co-or dim tion of Defence said the Effect of that a proposal had been received from the ForeignEconomic mSanctions.     Office that the Advisory Committee on Trade QuestionsTime of War should be asked to examine the effect(previous reference:    on Japan of the imposition of economic sanctions.Cabinet 37(37) , Con- As the natter had a political bearing he had thought-elusion 5.)it right to bring the proposal to the notice of theabinet.    In that connection he drew attention toReport on this very subject that had been prepared bythe Sub-Committee in March, 1932 (C.I.D. Paper No-^1083-B)some parts of which were appropriate to the presentsituation, though they wouldrrequire to be brought upto date.The Cabinet agreed  That the Advisory Committee on trade questions in Time of War should be instructed -&quot;To consider and report to the Committeeof Imperial Defence what results couldbe achieved by the imposition of economic sanctions against Japan by the BritishEmpire and the United States of Americain conjunction, alternatively with or without the co-operation of other countries.&quot;
6. The Cabinet had before them a Note by theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence (CcP.-248 (37))covering a Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committeewho had held a Meeting specially convened to discusscertain recommendations received by telegraph fromthe local Commanders of the three Services for immedi-ate steps to be taken to strengthen the defences ofEgypt.   The local Commanders had expressed concern at the recent deterioration in the international situation,and, in particular, at the despatch of Italian troops to Libya and the intention of the Italian Governmentto appoint Signor Parini as the Italian Minister inEgypt.   At the end of the Report the Chiefs of Staffsummed up their Conclusions as follows:-&quot;(i) The provision of fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft defences in Egypt is initself eminently desirable and would bea valuable factor in establishingconfidence in Egypt and. stabilising thesituation in the Eastern Mediterranean,but in present conditions  cannot beconsidered independently of the inter-national situation a.s a whole.(ii) Prom a purely military point of view weare aware of no new factor in the situationwhich leads us to consider that the mili-tary situation is such as to justify achange in our existing instructions thatno obtrusive measures should be taken inconnection with the defence of Egypt orin the projected movements of the Fleet.( iii) We note the opinion of the.Foreign office that the political situation in the Mediter-ranean at the present time is such as tojustify further measures to increase thesecurity of Egjrpt against Italian aggres-sion.    But we presume that the positionis likely to develop one way or the otheras the result of the meetings of theCommittee on Non-intervention in Spainnow in progress.(iv)  Italy&apos;s present commitments and pfe-occupations in Abyssinia and in Spain,her adverse economic and financial positionand the - unpreparedness of her ground, forcesin Libya, at the present time, for offensive operations in the Western Desert, make itimprobable that she v/ould embark single-handed on offensive action directed against egypt.
(v) The despatch of any forces from this country must inevitably weaken our position vis-ft-visGermany, and we have always considered thatwe should take no action which would resultin a diversion of our limited resources from our main objective, which is the securityof this  country against German aggression.(vi) We have despatched an interim reply to theLocal Commanders-in-Chief in Egypt (EnclosureNo.4), but a decision of the Cabinet is now required on the following points:-(a) Has the political situation vis-a-visItaly deteriorated at the present time,or is it likely to do so in the immedi-ate future as a result of a breakdown in the negotiations of the Committeeof Non-intervention in Spain, to suchan extent as to warrant a departure from our present instructions for taking no obtrusive measures for theadditional security of Egypt t(b) If the above is the case,(l)  should authority be given to theLocal Commanders to take all themeasures possible with the existing resources in or near Egypt, i.e.,those referred to in Paragraph 2 (ii)to (vi) above;(2) should forces be despatched fromthe United Kingdom at the costof weakening our anti-aircraft defence at home in the event ofGerman aggression or an extensionof trouble in the Mediterranean to northern Europe in such degree asto menace the United. Kingdom?(vii) Prom the time when a decision is taken to despatch reinforcements from this countryto the time when their presence will become effective in Egypt, a period, in time ofpeace, of about six weeks must be allowed.&quot;-The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence, in introducing the report   of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, said that, owing to the very brief time available before the meeting of the Cabinet, the report had     had   to be produced at short notice.     He would,therefore, like to recall the recent history of thisquestion.     At the Cabinet on July 14th, the foreign secretary had suggested that some sign ehould be shownin the Mediterranean of our rearmament.     The Cabinet had
expressed the desire that nothing provocative should bedone and had remitted the question to the Committee ofImperial Defence0     On July 28th, the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee had considered a draft interim report by theJoint Planning Sub-Committee on the situation in theMediterranean in the event of a unilateral war with italy in the autumn^     The main and immediate problem had beenthe defence of Egypt where there were no fighter aircraft and no ground anti-aircraft defences and only 10,000 Britishtroops.      They had recommended that in the event of anemergency the following steps ought to be taken:-Three fighter squadrons should be sent in an aircraft carrier to arrive under escort ineleven days;    further military and air re-inforcements should be sent via South africa to arrive in 40-60 days;    stores should besent by slow convoy via The Cape;    andmore important stores should be sent now.They had, however, pointed out the &quot;serious militaryproblem&quot; lacing Italy if that country had any idea of opera-tions against    us in Egypt.      They had added that if a brigade from India could arrive within 24 days, then theexisting military forces in Egypt could hold the situation,provided that there were no simultaneous emergencyrequiring troops in Palestine.     As the result of themeeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence on thefollowing day, July 29th, the Government of India hadbeen asked to give priority in their emergency arrangements to the possibility of the despatch of troops to Egypt, andthe War Office had taken steps to despatch sufficient supplies for the maintenance of reserves and war wastageto trover a period of two months.     In the meantime, theDefence Plans (Policy) Sub-Committee had decided that nothing provocative to Italy should be done in Egypt butthat net defences should be sent to Alexandria and an ammunition ship to the Mediterranean.     On the previous- 14 -
Saturday, the Chief of the Naval Staff had received atelegram from the Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterraneanreporting that the local Commanders of the three Forces(who had met in Egypt to consider certain matterssubmitted to them by the Chiefs of Staff) were concernedwith the deterioration of the international situation andhad suggested that certain immediate steps should be taken.The reason for their concern appeared to be the re-re-inforcement of the Italians in Libya and the Italiandemand for the appointment of a new Minister to Cairowho was notoriously anti-British.     On receipt of this telegram, the Chiefs of Staff had requested him to attend a meeting on Monday for the discussion of this telegramand their report was before the Cabinet.     He drew attention in particular to the fact that the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee considered the provision of fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft defences - all now deficient - in Egypteminently desirable in principle:    that, in appreciating themilitary position, they somewhat discounted the alarm asto the reinforcement of Italian troops in Libya and thoughtthat an Italian single-handed attack on Egypt by air was unlikely.     The Foreign Office reported &quot;increasein tension in the Mediterranean&quot;.     From a military pointof view, however, the Chiefs of Staff drew attention tothe many anxieties of the Italian Government which led themto consider a single-handed offensive at the present timeunlikely,,     Reviewing the matter from the point of viewof the international position, the Chiefs of Staff pointedout that whatever went to Egypt would weaken our military position vis-a-vis Germany. The Minister thought that the firstdecision to be taken by the Cabinet was on the point raised in paragraph (vi)(b)(1) quoted above, namely, as to whether our situation vis-a-vis Italy  had so deteriorated as to- 15 -
warrant a departure from present instructions for takingunobtrusive measures for the additional security of EgyptoThe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat the Charge d&apos;Affaires in Egypt had drawn his attentionto the fact that our military position in Egypt is nostronger than in August, 1935, and very considerably weakerthan in early 1936.     Despite the enormous reduction in theBritish Forces, the General Officer Commanding was now being asked to send reinforcements to Palestine0     The egyptian army was not yet any more effective than in 1935 as itsreorganisation by the Military Mission had not yet had timeto take effects     Above all, anti-aircraft defence was ascompletely non-existent as it was two years ago0     Theposition, therefore, was that the men on the spot were moreanxious than the Chiefs of Staff at home.      He pointed outalso the valuable effect which reinforcements would have onthe position in Egypt and the Near East generally.The Secretary of State for the Colonies also urgedthat sooner or later it would be necessary to show strength in the Mediterranean from the point of view of its effect onthe Arabs and the other nations of the Eastern MediterraneansThe Lord President of the Council, while not under-rating the importance of this, pointed out the danger at thepresent juncture of starting a vicious circle by the despatchof reinforcements which might stimulate the Italian Governmentto do the same.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was concerned at the result of a negative answer to the request for reinforcements.     The effect on the Near and Middle east of taking troops from Egypt and Palestine ought to be carefully
considered, especially at the present time when the italians were conducting an active anti-British propaganda in thoseregions.The Prime Minister said there were two distinctquestions:    one raised in the report of the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee and the other by the Foreign Secretary andthe Colonial Secretary.     So far as the Chiefs of staff report was concerned, the first question to be decided, as mentioned by the Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence, wasin (vi)(a) aboveo      If the answer to that were in the negative,  (vi)(b) would not arise.      The question raised bythe Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs and theColonies was a different one, namely, as to whether some action should be taken to display greater strength in theEastern Mediterranean,,The Secretary of State for Air drew attention tothe objections as brought out in the report of the Chiefsof Staff Sub-Committee to the despatch of anti-aircraft guns and searchlights to Egypt.     He suggested, however,that other means might be found for impressing the Near and middle East, for example, although he had not yet had anopportunity to consult his Advisers on the subject, heeoxild conceive    that it might be possible to send some modernaircraft to Egypt for the use of the existing squadronsand these might have more effect than the defensive measures asked for by the local Commanders.After some further discussion, the cabinet agreed:(a)    That the answer to the question in conclusion(vi)(a)sof the Chiefs of Staff report should be in the negative,   that is tosay, that the political situationvis-a-vis Italy had not deterioratedat the present time to such an extent as to warrant a departure from presentReproduced in the instructions for taking no obtrusivesummary at the head measures for the additional securityof this record. of Egypt:  the questions raised in (vi)(b)therefore did not arise;
That the Committee of Imperial defence should he asked to consider whether any steps of a military character and, if so,what steps could he taken at the presenttime, in view of all the circumstances, witha view to increasing our prestige in theNear and Middle Easto- 18 -
elusion 9,)Cabinet Committee had carefully considered this plan,and, though it was not free from difficulty, they recommended the Cabinet to accept it as the best way of meeting the royalty owners&apos; objections to the original proposals, subject to certain important reservationsrelating mainly to the financing of the scheme.The President of the Board of Trade explained the proposals of the Cabinet Committee and drew attention to the important reservations that they recommended as a condition of accepting the schemeof the Mineral Owners Joint Committee.The Chancellor of the Exhcequer said that hewas a member of the Coal Committee and entirelyconcurred in the conclusion.     But the Cabinet should realise that the scheme to be adopted was undoubtedly a departure from what had been at first intended and wasa departure in favour of the royalty owners.     It couldbe justified on the ground that it was a general rulewhen property was to be purchased that the vendorcontinued to enjoy the profits of the property untilthe date of completion when the money was actually paid over.     He had made careful enquiries on the very important financial question which was necessarilyheld in reserve in the Committee&apos;s Report.     The choicewas between the raising of this very large sum by theissue by the Coal Commission of a loan as soon as thsBill was passed, and providing in the Bill that the- 19 -(The Secretary for Mines entered at this points)&quot;COAL POLICY. 7.

loan might he issued at any time, in whole or in part,during the period which would elapse before the date of completion.     Of these two alternatives he preferred thelatter.     It would be a very serious obligation, in viewof our Defence borrowing which must take priority, to get from the City this additional sum in the immediate future;consequently, the better course was to face the risk,substantial though it was, that rates of interest would go up, and to arrange to raise the money when the occasionseemed most favourable in the course of the next three orfour years.     The risk must be taken though he warned theCabinet that, if rates of interest rose substantially,this might result in gravely imperilling the financialsoundness of the scheme.     And finally, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer emphasised the importance of securing boththe modifications in the royalty owners&apos; plan to which thePresident of the Board of Trade had referred.      It was essential that we should be entitled to make payments onaccount when the money was available during the interval,for otherwise we should be raising money on a long termloan and making no use of it.     Even so, the royalty ownerwho received an instalment would nevertheless continue todraw his royalties and would merely allow in account therate of interest on the instalment0     The second conditionmentioned by the President of the Board of Trade(paragraph 8 of the Report) was also very important.      TheChancellor feared that otherwise the Governments planmight be attacked,  not only on financial but on political grounds, since it would be said that after declaring thatthe policy of unification of royalties was of great public importance we had put it in the power of the royalty owners to hold up the carrying out of the amalgamation of- 20 -
leases, etc. for four years.     He pressed, therefore,that the owners should he required to accept theamalgamations decided upon hy the Coal Commission inthe interval, with the proviso that whether the arbitration for fixing any such compensation forinjurious affection was completed or not, any such scheme should come into operation six months after it&apos;wasformulated.The Secretary for Mines expressed agreementwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer and answeredquestions that were put to him. /The Prime Minister anticipated that the bill would not have an easy passage through Parliament but said he had reached the conclusion that the proposals ofthe Cabinet Committee ought to be accepted.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To adopt the report of the CabinetCommittee (CP.-240 (37)) subject to theChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s observationsand to approve its recommendations:(b) That the recommendation inparagraph 8 of CP. 240 (37) that&quot;an attempt should be made toget the plan modified so as toprovide that proposals by theCommission to vary or rearrangethe leases of a particular areacould not be held up by thecondition contained in paragraph4(b) of the plan beyond a periodof say, 6 months.&quot;though described in the report as not a vital condition for theGovernments acceptance of the plan should, nevertheless, be treatedas essential.(The Secretary for Mines withdrew.)

Hehad replied in the affirmative, for the reason that,after consulting the Viceroy, he doubted whether hewould be able to advise the King to go to India nextyear.     Sir Alexander Hardinge had then suggested thatthis would give colour to a rumour that the King didnot desire to visit India, although the facts were thatthe King would like to go as soon as he was advised that this could be done with advantage, and had suggestedthat a colourless reference to the subject should beintroduced.     He had found some difficulty in draftingsuch a reference but read to his colleagues thefollowing&quot;Although in the present uncertainties,I am not able to commit Myself to atime, I look forward nevertheless withkeen personal interest to the day when shall be able to visit my IndianEmpire.&quot;In the course of a short discussion, this draft was criticised on the ground that a passage ofthis kind might excite apprehensions among nervouspeople either of imminent war or of international trouble in India.The Cabinet were also reminded that theDominions were anxious that the King should visit them,
Reasons had &quot;been given as to why this was impracticableat the present time, but it was pointed out that ifreference was made to a possible visit to India, itmight re-open the question,,     Explanations v/ould haveto be given as to the special reasons for mentioningIndia.In this connection, however, the Cabinet were reminded that the Kingfs Speech on November 3rd, 1936,had contained the late King&apos;s hope &quot;to revisit hisIndian Dominions   and there to make known in the same manner as My revered Father to the Princes and peoples of India My succession to the Imperial Crown&quot;.After taking the decision on this point, asset forth in conclusion (b) below, the cabinet discussed other points in the King&apos;s Speech includingmore particularly the passages in square brackets on pages 3 and 4 of the speech dealing with proposed legislation, the principle of which had not yet beenapproved by the Cabinet.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the draft of the King&apos;sSpeech as set forth in CP.

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Health (CP.-238 (37)) seeking approval to the appointment of a Committee to inquire and reporton certain problems arising from the working of iron ore.   At present large areas of agricultural land werebeing converted into waste land, with no provision fortheir restoration, and it seemed impossible to con-template that they should be left permanently ruinedand derelict.   The Minister therefore suggested, withthe concurrence of the Treasury, that the Committee,which would be of strictly limited numbers consistingof persons independent of the particular interests concerned, might be given the following Terms ofReference:-&quot;To consider the problems raised by thedestruction of agricultural land as aresult of the excavation of iron ore inNorthamptonshire and neighbouring counties and to advise what measures should betaken for the future utilisation of thisland to the best advantage, whether byrestoration or otherwise, and hove thenecessary expenditure should be.met.&quot;The Minister of Transport asked that the termsof reference should not be limited to Northamptonshireand neighbouring counties, since a simiiar problemexisted in some other parts of the country.The Chancellor of the Exchequer was concerned asto what authority would be expected to pay for any measures that might be recommended by the Committeeand asked that its personnel should be carefully considered from this point of view.- 27 -
The Minister of Health undertook to givecareful consideration to both points.Subject to the above the Cabinet agreed:To approve the proposals of the Ministerof Health as set forth in CP. 238(37)and summarised above.

In order to encourage men now returning fromabroad to take advantage of the facilities offered,it was proposed, as a result of inter-Departmentaldiscussion between the Treasury, the Ministry of Labourand the War Office, that these men should attend theMinistry of Labour centres not as civilians but assoldiers in receipt of their ordinary military emolu-ments, their service being extended where necessary forthis purpose.    It was suggested that this proposal should, be regarded, and described as an experiment, theresult of which could be judged in six months&apos;  time-If successful, it could be continued;    if unfortunatelyit proved, a failure, the matter could be further consid-ered.   After describing the legal, Parliamentary andfinancial implications of the proposal the Secretary ofState asked, authority to proceed on the lines indicated.The Secretary of State for Air, while not opposing the proposals of the Secretary of State for War, pointedout that the same conditions would have to apply to theRoyal Air Force as to the Army, and if better terms were offered to soldiers they would also have to be offered to airmen.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he couldsettle that with the Secretary of State for Air.The Secretary of State for India insisted thatthere must he no further liability for the finances of India, and reserved his position in that respect.The Secretary of State for War pointed out thatin any event the cost of his proposals would be verysmall.The Prime Minister said that he had received a request from the Admiralty tJO have it recorded that any decision reached on the War Office proposals should notbe regarded as prejudicing in any way the finaldecision on the Admiralty proposal for vocational training on which they were in consultation with theTreasury.Subject to the above the Cabinet agreed:To approve the proposals of the Secretaryof State for War as set forth in CP.245(37) and summarised above.

APPENDIX I.ANSWER.His Majesty&apos;s Government have very carefully consideredthe recommendations of the Select Committee.     They have been impressed by the amount of interest &quot;which has on several occasions been displayed by the House in connection with the drafting of Financial Resolutions, and, while not acceptingall the criticisms directed against the present practice aswell-founded;, they have approached the question with everydesire to remedy, so far as this may be consistent with theiivresponsibilities^ any features in the present position which appear to hon. Members to be unsatisfactory.The Select Committee in their Report make two main recommendations which may be summarised shortly as follows:-First, the passing of a declaratory resolution by theHouse to be enforced by the authority of the Chair indicatingcertain general lines upon which Financial Resolutionsshould be drawn.Secondly, the alteration of Standing Orders so as toallow the Second Reading of Money Bills (other than thoseoriginating in Committee of &quot;Ways and Means) to be taken before consideration of the relevant Financial Resolutionsin Committee.The Government, for their part, are prepared to accept in substance the second recommendation, as enabling hon.Members to express their vitswc on the detailed provisions ofthe Bill at an early stage,  and as meeting the criticism thatthe House should not be required to examine anC. .3iscuss theterms of the financial provisions as set out in the FineuicialResolution before being fully informed of the Governments
intentions as detailed in the clauses of the Bill.     TheGovernment note that the new procedure proposed by theSelect Committee is permissive and not mandatory and as wasthe case with the similar recommendation made by the SelectCommittee on   Procedure in 1932 the right of the Governmentto proceed by way of preliminary resolution would be leftunimpaired.      It is not however contemplated that theexercise of this right would be other than exceptional.While appreciating the considerations upon whichthe resolution included in the first recommendation isfounded, the Government cannot feel that the directions setout therein are compatible with the fundamental principleembodied in Standing Order No. 63, namely, that of theCrown&apos;s initiative in regard to expenditure, a principle the wisdom of which the Committee recognised.     Apart fromthis point of principle, which the Government regard as of supreme importances there are certain practical difficultieswhich would render the operation of the arrangement outlined in the resolution unsatisfactory and inequitable.      In thisconnection I would refer, if   I may, to the evidence tendered to the Committee by you, Sir, in which you questioned the wisdom of placing upon you the duty of giving decisions fromtime to time on highly controversial matters involving theconsideration of the relative financial importance of varioussuggested alternatives.Although unable to subscribe to the proposed declara-tory resolution, His Majesty&apos;s Government as already stated,are in sympathy with the desire of Hon. Members to be in aposition to offer constructive criticism of financial measures, and they therefore welcome the opportunity of declaring that it is their definite intention to secure that financial Resolutions in respect of Bills shall be so
 7&amp; 371framed as not to restrict the scope within which theCommittee on the Bills may consider amendments further than is necessary to enable His   Majesty&apos;s Government to dis-charge their responsibilities in regard to public expen-diture.I trust that the House will be satisfied with thatassurance and the adoption of the second recommendation ofthe Select Committee, which together will, I am confident,substantially remove any legitimate grievances felt byHon. Members.
