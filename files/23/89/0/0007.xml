TSIT OPjDIISTER.1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that the Prime Minister of Yugo-Slavia would shortly be visiting this country and that he was sending out an invitation to his  colleagues for a Dinner at theForeign Office on Thursday, October 14th.    In viev.r of theimportance of this visit he hoped that, notwithstanding the short notice, as many members of the Cabinet aspossible would, accept the invitation and attend theDinner.   He added that The King would be entertainingthe Prime Minister of Yugo-Slavia at luncheon on the15th, which showed the importance attached to the visit.-1-
&apos;   &apos; 251 I]SPAIN. 2. The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Military   reported evidence of changes in the actual militarySituation and prospects.       situation in Spain.    There had been an outburst of axractivity, and the majority of the Spanish Government&apos;s(previous reference:     ports had been bombed.   The intention was probably partlyCabinet 35(37), Con-     to intimidate the Spanish Government, but partly also toelusion 3 .) alsostop supplies of food, which had/been the objects of submarine/   piracy.    Commander Hillgarth, the Consul at Palma,had given warning that more aeroplanes had arrived from italy and that an increase.se in bombing must be expected.Before the arrival of the latest aircraft there were reported to be from 120 to 140 aeroplanes in Majorca.The Secretary of State called attention also to atelegram, which had been circulated to the Cabinet,reporting the landing of Italian troops and arms at Cadiz.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador had reported from Hendayethat four Divisions of Italian troops, with equipment,were expected, to move to the Aragon front, where the offensive was likely to take place.Reports had been received also that General Francocontemplated an offensive about the 18th October.Information had also been received from Rome to the effectthat 23 Savoia-Marchetti-79 aeroplanes had left MonteCelio via. Sardinia within the last two days.   The pilotswere 20 &quot;aces&quot; who had accompanied General Balbo on hisflight to Chicago, and included the winner of the IstriaParis-Damascus air race.    It was also reported that furthervolunteers had sailed to Spain from Sicily.   This fitted,in with stories of an application from General Franco&apos;sHigh Command to Italy for early assistance.   All thisindicated that General Franco intended to make a big effort to beat down the resistance of&apos; the Government this autumn.
In reply to a question by the Chancellor of theExchequer he pointed out that these events were almostcontemporaneous with Count Ciano1s statement to theBritish Charge&apos; dfAffaires in Rone that no furthervolunteers would be sent, though subsequently theItalian Foreign Minister had denied having made thestatement.
SPAIN- 3. The Secretary of State for Poreign Affairsjae Situation     informed the Cabinet that the Anglo-French Note hadin the Medit-mediterranean. been handed to the Italian Government and was now being studied by Signor Mussolini.   He could not conjecture(previous^Reference:        what the reply would be.Cabinet 35(37), Con- Germany at present showed no sign of v/Fishing toelusion 2.)take part in the proposed, conversations.
spain.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, inthe absence of the First Lord of the Admiralty, informedinarinetack on--itish the Cabinet that the attack on a British Destroyer by astray er.submarine, reported in that day s Press, was suspectedto have been made by one of General Franco&apos;s submarines.The attack had. been made in daylight. It seemed probablethat the subrmrine had escaped.The Cabinet were reminded that the submarine would only have observed the Destroyer through its periscopeand that a mistake might easily have been made.
THB FAR EASTjapan and china.(previous reference:Cabinet 35(37), Con-elusion 4.)5c The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that Viscount Cranborne, at Geneva, had informed.him that a resolution of a fairly satisfactory characterwas likely to be passed the same day.    It would, be in two parts.   The first part, without naming Japan as an aggressor, would contain an indication that that country had. in fact committed an aggression.   The second part-would contain a suggestion for summoning a meeting ofthe signatories of the China Nine-Power Treaty of 1922.He thought that this was the best step that could betaken , and it would, give the fullest scope to theUnited States of America to give any co-operation theycould.   After President Roosevelt1s speech it was hardly possible for the American Government to reject thesuggestion.    The passing of this resolution might involvewithin the next few days a meeting of the six Powerssignatories of the Nine-Power Treaty who were alsoMembers of the League of Nations, in order, to make arrangements for carrying out the recommendation of theLeague.some discussion took place as to the probable effect of such a meeting on the three Powers who werenot Members of the League of Nations.    There was generalagreement that it would, be necessary to act in accordancewith any pro vis ions that might be contained in the treaty for summoning a meeting of signatories.Some discussion took place as to the significanceto be attached to President Roosevelt&apos;s speech on theprevious day.The Prime Minister pointed out that the speechintroduced, a new factor into the situation, and, whatever its real significance, it was likely to be made use offor political purposes by the Opposition Parties in thiscountry.    It would be important for the Government not
to be manoeuvred into a position in which it could besaid that the United States had offered to co-operate in economic sanctions if the United Kingdom would join themand that we were standing in the way of such action.The speech, however, was so involved that it was verydifficult to discover its meaning.    Nevertheless, somereply ought to be made at once, without waiting for theoccasion of a Parliamentary Debate, and as he himself would be making a public speech in two days&apos; time he could hardly avoid some comment.    His present inclination wasto s&amp;y that- President Roosevelt&apos;s remarks voiced the feelings of people in this country and that he welcomeda statement on the sanctity of treaties coming from sucha quarter and would await any proposals that night bemade.    This would bring out the point that the intentions of the President&apos;s speech were not very clea.r.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed with the Prime Minister, but added that in addition to apublic reply it would be necessary to take some diplomatic action.   He recalled that the British Charge&quot; d*Affaires .at Washington had been asked to make some enquiries as tothe American attitude towards the idea of action to bringend the conflictto an /  in China.   As yet he had received no reply.It was not unlikely that the American Secretary of state would intimate that the President had given the answer in his speech.    He proposed to instruct the Charged&apos;Affaires in that event to ask what was the meaning ofthe speech.The Secretary of State for War said that theGeneral Staff were disturbed about the possible develop-ments of events in the Far East.   At Shanghai there were small British forces adjacent to relatively overwhelmingJapanese forces .   Hong-Kong also could not., in presentcircumstances, be held against a Japanese attack.
The General Staff also held that the actions of theJapanese had not been unjustified.   For exanple, the bombing of the Capital was a justifiable act of war whichwas likely to be undertaken by any country in-the...eventof hostilities.    The bombing attack on the BritishAnba.ssad.or ought, they thought, to have been avoided, asthe Military Atta.che ought not to have allowed him totake this risk.The Secretary of State for Air reminded the Cabinetthat captxxred. ma.ps showed that the Japanese objectives were of a military character.The Cabinet were also reminded, that the Japaneseaeroplanes in some cases load probably been getting rid oftheir bombs to avert a forced descent;    that since the strong expressions of public opinion the Japanese had been more careful in their raiding attacks;    and that if thenations were to proceed b/eyond remonstrances or threatsthe Japanese would have no further incentive to mitigatetheir action and the Chinese civilians would, suffer.The Prime Minister pointed out that the real ground for objection to the Japanese attitude was that theyshould have engage^ in hostilities at all.   He appreciated the preoccupations of the General Staff about the dangers of the situation, and with this in mind he had seen the archbishop of Canterbury and. had done his best to dampdown the nature of the speeches made at the Albert Hallon the previous day.   He could not imagine anything moresuicidal than to pick a quarrel with Japan at the presentmoment when the European situation had become so serious.If this country were to become involved in the Far east the temptation to the Dictator States to take action,whether in Eastern Europe or in Spain, night be irresist-
In the course of the discussion the view was expressed that public opinion and the Press tended to isolate Par Eastern affairs too much from the generalworld situation.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat the Foreign Office had done what they could to givethe Press a right view of the situation.    He thought it-possible that events in Spain in the near future might&apos; draw attention away from the Far East.The Prime Minister pointed out tha.t the attitudeof the Press had not been unhelpful in this matter, anddrew attention to an articl? in the &apos;&apos;Manchester Guardian&quot;on the previous day at the end of which it ha.d been pointed out that sanctions, if effective, involved therisk of war, and,if they were not effective, were of no value.    That was a point which might have to be put tothe United States of America, namely, as to whether, inthe event of their favouring economic sanctions, theywere prepared for the consequences, which might wellinclude co-operating in the defence of our own possessionsin the Far East.   For the moment he felt that PresidenthadRoosevelt/rather embarrassed the situation, but he didnot under-rate the importa.nce of his sts.tenent, especially as a warning to the Dictator Powers that there was apoint beyond which the United States of America would not permit them to go.    Consequently, if evv:b arras sing today,the speech might prove useful later on.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Prime Minister should considerthe inclusion in his speech on Friday,October 8th, of some comments on president roosevelt&apos;s speech:(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should consider appropriatediplomatic auction at Washington.
PARLIAMENT. 6.   The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet a letterRe-assenbly    he had received from the Leader of the Labour opposition of.Party asking that Parliament should be summoned before(Previous October 21st. He happened to have received an indicationReference:Cabinet 31    that even the Opposition Labour leaders were not unani-(37), Con-elusion 1.)   mous in desiring this.   He thought the best plan would bethat he himself should send a reply to the effect thatthere was no need, to summon Parliament but that theGovernment were willing to give facilities for a De?3ateon the Par East on the afternoon and evening of October21st, postponing prorogation until the following day.The Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs pointedout the inconvenience of a Debate in which the Par east would be separated from the general foreign situation,as it was bound to lead to a demand for a further andmore extended Debate at the first possible opportunity.The Prime Minister agreed in these objections, but pointed out that in rejecting the proposal for an earliersummoning of Parliament he could hardly refuse facilitiesfor debate.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Prime Minister.-10-
FAR EAST. 7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drewSupply   attention to a discussion which had taken place at the arms to.Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on defence Policy and Requirements on the 30th September onthe subject of the supply of arms to the Far East, whenthe following conclusions had been recorded:-&quot;(a)  That private firms should continue to beallowed to supply armaments to the belligerents in the Sino-Japanese dispute,provided that the Service Department, orDepartments,  concerned in any particularorder are satisfied that it can be accepted without detriment to their own re-armamentprogramme.(b) To note that the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs votilft arrange to have thelegal&quot;aspects of the supply of armamentsfrom Government surplus stocks to the belligerents in the Sino-Japanese disputeexamined in the Foreign Office.&quot;(P,.P.Ro 45rd Meeting, Minute 5.)He presumed that the policy should be to continue suppliesnominally to both parties since there had been no declara-tion of war, though, in practice, to do w hat ever we couldfor Chins, and to delay the issue of licences for exportsto Japan.In the course of the discussion on this point theCabinet were informed that certain aeroplane firms hadregular contracts to supply engines to Japan.    These hadnot been interfered with by the Air Ministry as the engineswere equally useful for civil or military purposes, andfrom the point of view of our own defence requirementsthere was no case for stopping their export on the groundthat we needed then ourselves.Considerable doubts were expressed as to whetherthe fact that there had been no declaration of war was sufficient, in present circumstances, to justify a continuance of the exportation of arms, particularly inview of the strong public opinion against Japan.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointedout that he had used the phrase for the reason that itv/as the test for raising the question of action undeyArticle 16 of the Covenant and for the application ofthe Neutrality Law in the United States of America.The Cabinet were reminded that the amounts ofBritish arms which could be spared for China would bevery small, but that the fact of sending them might raiselarge issues the consequences of which might react onChina.   At the moment the main issue on the arms questionrevolved round Hong-Kong, which was suspected by Japanas being used as a. centre for the distribution into Chinaof arms and war material from abroad.    If the issue were forced through the despatch of arras from this country to china, Japan might raise awkward questions over theposition both of Hong-Kong and of the Kowloon-CantonRailway.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said thatthe Colonial Office were keeping in close touch with theForeign Office on the Hong-Kong position.The question was raised as to what were the amounts of war material for which licences had been given or were being asked for from China and Japan respectively,and it was suggested that the Cabinet ought to haveparticulars of this .The Cabinet were reminded that, having regard toour own needs,- the quantities of war material forexportation to the Far East for which licences could begranted must in any event be limited.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the President of the Board of trade should refer to the Cabinet in the eventof any applications for licences to exportarms to Japan:(b) That the Government Departments concerned(e.g., the Service Departments and theBoard of Trade) should make discreetenquiries as to the quantities of warmaterial involved in applications made,or likely to be made in the near future,for the exportation of war material to japan or China? and that Ministers should report the position to the Cabinet.-12-
pQpjUGAL.propos edjespateh ofj pritishjilitaryfission.6PreviousReference:Cabinet 31(37), Con-conclusion 5,)C,    With reference to the Conclusion mentioned inthe margin, the Cabinet had. before them a Note by theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence (CP.-223 (37))on the subject of Anglo-Portuguese Relations, reporting that the Portuguese Government had expressed their fullapproval of the suggested despatch of a military mission to Portugal, and circulating for the consider-ation of his  colleagues -( i)  A Report by the Deputy Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee (0.0*3.-623), preparedduring the recess,  containing recom-mendations as to the general scope ofthe Mission, its composition, duration of its visit to Portugal, and theallocation o^ cost.     This Report hadreceived the approval of the Chiefs ofStaff Sub-Committee:( ii)  A Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staffthemselves ( C.0 oS.-625)   containingmore detailed recommendations as tothe scope a.n^ functions of the Mission,and attaching as Appendices a Memorandumon the importance of Anglo-Portugueserelations from the strategical point ofview and. extracts from a letter fromthe Portuguese Ambassador in London tothe Permanent Under-Secretary of State,Foreign Office,  in which the former gave a Portuguese viewpoint, - to be used by.the Mission as a. general guide whendiscussing strategical problems withthe Portuguese, but without quotingtheir contents. ;After the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence had explained the proposals of the Ghiefsof Staff Sub-Committee, the Chancellor of the.Exchequer expressed&apos;the hope that xhe Cabinet would agree to the Report).     He agreed xnat three monthswas a reasonable period for the Mission.      He pointedout that the usual&apos; practice was that the country which asked for a-&apos;Mission should pay for it.      he realised, however, that this was ncu practicable inthe present case.      He asked, there^jre, to have on record that the Mission was only for ithree months
and that if it resulted in the appointment of apermanent Mission, the Government were not committed topay for it.The Secretary of State for Poreign affairs said that if the Cabinet approved the proposals, his intention was to show them first informally to thePortuguese Ambassador.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the recommendations contained in C.O.S. 623 as to thegeneral scope and composition ofthe Mission to Portugal;    that the duration of its visit should belimited to three months;    and thatduring that period His Majesty&apos;government should bear the oost, butthat they should not be committed bythe present decision to do so beyond that periods(b) To approve CCS. 625 as the basis for the instructions to be issued to- the Mission.- 14 -
9.       The Secretary of State for the Coloniesrecalled that at their previous meeting referred toin the margin, the Cabinet had left to him thedecision as to the desirability for proclaimingMartial Law in Palestine.     An Inter-departmental conference had been held on the day following theCabinet meeting at which the conclusion had beenreached that the delegation of the Acting HighCommissioner^ powers was   unnecessary.      The ActingHigh Commissioner already had all necessary powers for dealing with the situation and it was thoughtinadvisable that he should delegate them.      It was true that delegation to the General Officer Commandingmight have some moral effect on the population, but&apos;the Conference had felt that it was important to restore the prestige of the Civil Government.     Hehad also consulted the Acting High Commissioner, who reported that he and the General Officer Commandingagreed that delegation to the Military was unnecessaryat present.     The Secretary of State had consequentlydecided to continue as at present.      If, however, thesituation deteriorated, the matter  v/ould bere considered and in the interval everything would beprepared for a rapid transfer of powers in case of necessity.     Up to the present time,  the results ofthe action taken in Palestine had been favourable.The country was comparatively quiet.     A local press censorship had been imposed      prohibiting any reference to the Grand Mufti.       It must not beassumed, however,  that we were &quot;out of the wood&quot;.In reply to questions, he said that out often members of the Arab Higher Committee three had
been abroad, five had been arrested and embarked forthe Seychelles, one had been arrested but there was some uncertainty as to whether he had really been a member ofthe Committee and one had evaded arrest;.The Prime Minister commented that the successwas perhaps greater than appeared at first sight.- 16 -
CEYLON. 10.      The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byproposals for the Secretary of State for the Colonies ( CP.-220 (37))Amendment of constitution,    informing his colleagues of certain difficulties whichhad arisen in connection with the exercise by the(Previous Governor of Ceylon of the powers given to him by the reference. J?R0?neCon-       Ceylon (state Council) Order in Council of 1931,elusion 5.)     particularly in matters relating to the public&apos; services.    Owing to the obstructive attitude of theState Council in circumstances outlined in the Memo-rand um, it had become necessary to define more clearlyand. to render more effective the powers of the Governor.The Secretary of State therefore sought the approvalof the Cabinet for the submission to the King in Councilof an amending Order in Council bringing the Governor&apos;spowers more into line with the powers given to theGovernor-General by the Government of India Act, andplacing beyond doubt, on the lines of the Governmentof Indie. Act, the authority of the Secretary of Stateover the salaries and conditions of service of theessential public services, namely, the Civil Service,the Police and the Judiciary.   Such an amending order would, only make fully operative the powers which the donoughmore Commission of 1928 clearly intended theGovernor to possess, and would not prejudice thefuture amendment o^ those provisions o^ the constitu-tion which did not affect the powers of the governor and the Secretary of State.The Secretary of State for the Colonies gave an explanation of his proposals and expressed the hopethat the Cabinet would approve the amendment ofArticle 22 of the Ceylon (State Council) Order-in-Council of 1931.  though he proposed to defer until later the amendment of Articles 86 and 87.
In the course of a discussion,-some doubts were expressed as to whether in the light of experience in India the amendment was desirable, and as towhether the amendment might not involve the raising of much wider issues, for example, in connection withImperial preference.On the suggestion of the Prime Minister,the Cabinet agreed:That, before a decision was taken, theSecretary of State for the colonies should he asked to circulate his proposals In the form of a draft order-in-Council for the considerationof the Cabinet.-
The Cabinet had under consideration a Note by theSecretary to the Committee of Home Affairs (H.A.-29 (37))covering classified lists of Bills suggested by Depart-ments for the Parliamentary Session 193 7-38, togetherwith the following Conclusion thereon by the Committeeof Home Affairs (H.A.C. 11th Conclusions (37) l):-To recommend the Cabinet to adopt thefollowing classification of the Billsnamed in Annex T to the present Conclu-sions, on the understanding that it willbe for the Cabinet to determine the orderof priority and relative importance ofthe Bills within each of the respectivelists(A) Annual or Compulsory Bills.(B) Urgent or Essential Bills (otherthan those named in (A) above) .(C) Useful Bills, mainly non-controversial .(D) Other Bills not yet ready, or Billsrequired in certain.in events.(E) Consolidation Bills.The Committee&apos;s detailed  conclusions onthe Bills suggested by Departments forthe Parliamentary Session 1937-38 are contained, in Appendix I.The Cabinet also had. before them a Note by theSecretary to the Committee of Home Affairs (H.A.-30(37))   covering a tentative list of Bills suggested, by departments for the 1938-39 Session, drawn up by direction of the Prime Minister:    together with thefollowing Conclusion thereon by the Committee of HomeAffairs (H.A.C. 11th Conclusions (37) 2):-To submit to the Cabinet the. tentativelist,  contained:&quot;in   Annex    il   to thepresent Conclusions, of Bills suggested,by Departments for the 193 8-39 Parlia-mentary Session. (Appendix II.)
The Lord Chancellor, as Chairman of theCommittee of Home Affairs, made a statement in thecourse of which he mentioned that the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury was anxious that Ministers,whohad ready Bills requiring Second Reading, should communicate with him as it might be possible to fitthem into the Parliamentary Programme before Christmas.The Lord President of the Council, as leader of the House of Lords, asked that his colleagues should consider the possibility of extending the list of bills for first introduction in that House.The Secretary of State for Air asked the Cabinetto note that a resolution of both Houses of Parliamentiwould be necessary approving an Order-in-Council for theestablishment of a licensing authority and licensing system for internal airways^     He had omitted tocommunicate this requirement to the Committee of HomeAffairs but, as it would involve Parliamentary time, he asked his colleagues to take note of it.The Home Secretary drew attention to Item 9&quot;Nationality (Amendment)&quot; on page 7 of H.A,C.llthConclusions and entered a caveat that the statement that this Bill &quot;was suitable for introduction by a private member&quot; was incorrect.Subject to the above observations, theCabinet agreed:To approve the recommendations ofthe Committee of Home Affairs asset forth above &amp;
ItrisHbchantIPS.fensiveling of.$maeviouseference:,binet 3*(The Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to theAdmiralty entered for the discussion of this Item.)12.    The Cabinet resumed their discussion of theproposals contained in a Memorandum by the First Lordof the Admiralty (CP.-215 (37)) for the stiffeningof British merchant ships to enable them to takedefensive armament, which had. been postponed at theprevious Meeting in the absence of the Chancellor of157), Con-conclusion  12.;    the Exchequer, and with a view to the Admiralty&quot;furnishing further information as to the classes ofship they desired to strengthen.In the course of the discussion,  theChancellor of the Exchequer, who had not be^n present at the previous discussion, said that he had. odnsideredthe matter closely and had received some indication ofthe views of certain shipowners.     He was willing toagree that so far as ships already built and in commission were concerned, the Government would have topay the cost, but this ought not to apply to shipsbuilt in the futurec      He suggested that another effortought to be made to reach a compromise on the subject with shipowners, and he was willing, if necessary, totake part in discussions on the subject.      If ships were not in future provided with the necessary stiffening,the question would arise as to whether they shouldreceive a Board of Trade certificate.      If theGovernment were to give way to the extent of undertaking100 per cent, of the cost in the case of merchant ships for an indefinite period, it would increase their difficulties in respect of air raid precautions overa wide field.The Prime Minister said he had, thought it mightbe possible to go further than the Chancellor of theExchequer and lay down as a decision that in futureships of over 500 tons must be strengthenedo      So far
as those under construction were concerned, he thoughtthat the Government ought to take full responsibility.There appeared to be room for a bargain in respect ofships built and in commission..The Parliamentary and Financial Secretary tothe Admiralty said that the Shipping AdvisoryCommittee had done their best to persuade the ship-owners but had been unable to induce them to incurany expenditure for strengthening existing ships which they had had to run for a long time with littleprofit. They also resisted any proposal that theyshould pay in the case of future ships0     So far as the220 ships now under construction were concerned, he urgedthat it was well worth while for the Government to incur the relatively small cost of stiffeningo     So far as existing ships were concerned, it would be a greatstep forward if the Board of Trade and the ShippingAdvisory Committee could agree on a selection of ships to be stiffened at  the rate of   50 or 60 a yearinvolving an expenditure of perhaps  60,000.The President of the Board of Trade advised the Cabinet that there was no prospect of a successfulnegotiation in respect of ships whether built or to be built*     For twenty years, shipowners had steadilyrefused to stiffen their ships0      If anything was. to bedone, it would have to be compulsory0      He did not thinkthat the Board of Trade Regulations, which were designed for the safety of ships, would enable them to insist onstrengthening being undertakene      In his view, theCabinet must face the fact that if they wanted to induce shipowners to strengthen future ships, they
must legislate and that at a time when shipowners were finding costs so high that they were placing no moreorders for new ships.      The legislation would hecontentious and hardly fought.     He hoped that theGovernment would pay for stiffening all ships nowunder construction.     The ships which it was desired tostrengthen would, in fact, only &quot;be selected, forexample, oilers, ships carrying foodstuffs and so forth,so that any legislation would have to apply to.a partonly of the ships.     He thought that if strengtheningwas necessary, it should be done with the Governmentmoney, and added that personally he did not share theview that shipowners ought to be called on to pay forthis.The Parliamentary and Financial Secretary &quot;bothe Admiralty said that the idea of the Admiralty was to select certain classes of ships including tankers andcargo liners, but not those of over 12 years of age andthat the State should undertake liability for them.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he was prepared to pay for selected ships which had already been built and were in commission and, in addition, forselected ships under construction, but he felt strongly that the State ought not to undertake to pay for thestiffening of ships to be built in the future.The Cabinet agreed:(a) That the Government should under-take the cost of stiffening existingships of over 500 tons which fell within the categories selected bythe Admiralty: the process beingcarried out in annual instalments.(b) That, the Government should pay forthe stiffening of correspondingships now in course of construction.
(c)   That the Admiralty and the Boardof Trade should furtherinvestigate the question of whether shipowners could be persuaded or compelled tostrengthen future ships in theproposed categories and whether,in the event of compulsion beingresorted to, this could beachieved without legislation or,in the contrary event, whatlegislation would be involved.Note:     During the above discussion, the PrimeMinister withdrew and the Chancellor of .the Exchequer took the Chair.     The lord president of the Council,  the Secretaryof State for India and the Secretary ofState for Air also withdrew with thePrime Minister to attend the memorial service to the late Lord^Peel.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.6th October, 1937.
