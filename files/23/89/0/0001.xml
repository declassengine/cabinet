PAIN. 1- The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs recalled that when he last reported to the CabinetTeviouseference:        there had been a deadlock in the Non-interventionabinet 29 .37) , Con-        -Committee.   That deadlock still existed, but effortslueion 2.)were being made to resolve it.   Before the Meeting of*      FR.31/57)2-. .       m  . ^the Non-intervention Committee on the previous Fridayit had become clear that no nation wanted a breakdown,though no-one saw a way out.    There had been vaguesuggestions that the matter should be dealt with by aMeeting of the four Powers, or that the small powers should make proposals.    Eventually hints had. been thrown out that the British Government should formulate aproposal.    This had been suggested at last Friday&apos;sMeeting by the Netherlands representative, and hadreceived, unanimous support.    This rather bore out hisbelief that everyone wanted to find a way out .On the previous day he had seen the Ambassadors ofthe Powers mainly concerned, and had listened to whatthey had to say.    He had. not thought it wise to consult them about the plan, which he wished should be a purely british one.    Such indications as he had. received,however, were not unfavourable as to the possiblereception of the plan, which he proposed to  communicateat once to the nations  concerned and to produce at a.Meeting of the full Non-intervention Committee on Friday.If it was acceptable in principle it was probable thatit would be referred to a smaller Committee to be worked out in detail.He had seen the Portuguese Ambassador, who reportedthat his Government, had been irritated at a change of attitude on General Franco&apos;s part.    General Franco,however, now was reported to be willing to part with.   his volunteers, though he had not wanted that to besaid publicly at last Friday&apos;s Meeting o^ the Non-intervention Committee, as it would, tend to apset his-1-
relations with Germany and Italy.    There were now some signs that Germany and Italy might be willing to bargainon the basis of a withdrawal of volunteers.    The soviet ambassador had suggested that the whole situation wouldbe profoundly changed if volunteers were to be withdrawn.The French attitude towards the withdrawal of volunteerswas also favourable.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thenhanded round the text of his proposal (Appendix I).which wa.s read by members of the Cabinet during a shortad journment.Enquiries were made as to whether there was not a risk that the qualifications to belligerent rightsproposed, in paragraph 3 might -ftet be detrimental to theinterest of this country, which, as a Naval Power, was concerned in the maintenance of belligerent rights tothe full.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatthis matter had been most carefully considered by theForeign Office, including the Legal Adviser, and hadbeen discussed, with the Admiralty.    The present position was quite peculiar in many respects:    for example, wewere dealing with a. civil war and not with a war between two notions.    In the event of a. major war in which we require&apos;-5 to use belligerent rights we could claim thatthe Great v/ar provided a. better precedent than theSpanish Civil War.   He asked the Cabinet to note thatin the sixth line of paragraph 3 the word &quot;and.&quot; had been altered to &quot;but&quot;, so that the first sentence of para-graph 3 would read as follows :-&quot;With a view to the more effective appli-cation of the policy of Non-intervention,all Governments parties to the Non-intervention Agreement to recognise thetwo parties in Spain as possessing a status which justifies then in exercisingbelligerent rights at sea, in accordancewith the rules governing such exercise,but. subject to the following conditions:-&quot;
He thought that this went some way to meet the criticism that had been raised.A suggestion was made that the word  &quot;certain&quot;should be inserted in the first sentence of paragraph3, quoted above, before the words  &quot;belligerent rights at sea&quot;.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs did not object to the proposal, but pointed, out that it wouldmake it less palatable to General Franco.The Prime Minister thought the addition was unnecessary.    The sentence as it stood did not purportto provide a definition of belligerent rights, thoughit did set forth that recognition in this particular case was subjected to certain conditions.    In thesecircumstances there was no risk of our being compelled,at some future time to accept the conditions applied in this particular instance as of general application.He thought that the substitution of the word  &quot;but&quot; for&quot;and&quot; had met any possible criticism.On page 3, line 3, of the proposal, the question was raised as to whom the word  &quot;them&quot; referred to.The Secretary o^ State for Foreign Affairs said itreferred to the Powers .Some discussion took place as to condition (b) ofparagraph 3, and. it was suggested that the second partof the paragraph was contradictory to the first.The Secretsry of State for Foreign Affairs said thatthe second sentence was taken out. of a proposal made bythe German Ambassador.The Prime Minister reminded the Cabinet that the document did. not purport to be final, but was to besent to the Powers as a basis for discussion.    It wasnot unlikely that if some point such as paragraph 3 (b)was not acceptable to any Power, it would, suggest an alteration.  He thought that the document as a whole was-3-
a good basis for discussion.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To authorise the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to send the proposed statement by the United Kingdom Govern-ment (Appendix I)  to the Powers repre-sented. on the Non-intervention committee as a basis for discussion at the nextPlenary Meeting:(b) To take note that the draft statement had already been telegraphed to theDominions:(c) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be authorised, to printthe draft Statement as a. White paper in time for delivery to Members withthe Votes on the morning of Thursday,July l^th.-4-
SPAIN. 2.    The Home Secretary said, that he had received aeuation of       fresh request, for permission to bring further Spanishldren.children to this  country from Santander, addressed toevious him by a different group from those who had made theference:binet 20 earlier proposal,    They wanted, an immediate answer.7)    Con-us ion 2.) ^rthe-^. t ion of rmpnrn/ibilxLv  Cm Llie maxntenanue&apos;L V ^^-y^fttg^fes, He proposed, to 3*ej?e*4-*feer^stateraents already made by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs inthe House of Commons on July 5th (Parliamentary Deba.tes,Vol. 326, No ,13 7, Col ,9)  and the Earl of Plymouth inthe House of Lords on the 8th July (House of LordsDebates, Vol. 106, No.88, Col. 23^) .    His advice tothe Gabinet was not. to accept any addition to thenumbers of Spanish refugees in this  country.The Minister op Health mentioned, that the originalCommittee wished to bring more  children into thiscountry .The Cabinet were informed, that reports on theSpanish refugees were not of a favourable character.The Cabinet agreed  That fresh applications for theintroduction of refugees from Spainshould be refused.
MOROCCO.Extra-territory-rial Rights in.(previous reference:Cabinet 48(36), Con-clusion 7 (b) .)French rights at Zanzibar.British Censorin State Bankof Moro ceo .Customs Dues on british Goods *3 . The Cabinet had before thera a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-180 (37))stating that, following upon the convention for theabolition of the Capitulations in Egypt, the FrenchGovernment had asked for negotiations for the conclu-sion of a Convention regarding the surrender ofBritish extra-territorial rights in Morocco, and thatit had been agreed that such negotiations should be begun at the Foreign Office on July 12th.   The position had recently been discussed between representatives ofthe Foreign Office and the Toard of Trade and a delega-tion of British commercial interests concerned, andthe effect of the proposals they had drawn up for thepurpose of the negotiations was shown in an Appendixattached to the Memorandum.In the course of a short discussion the attentionof the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was drawn to the following points:-(l) The desirability of taking advantage ofthe present, opportunity to abolish theFrench rights at Zanzibar, some of which(e.g.? the right of exemption from taxation) were open to strong objection.(2)  That the Foreign Office should consult the Treasury on the subject of the Britishcensor in the State Bank of Morocco, whoseduties were to see that no favour wasconferred by the Bank on French as  comparedwith British nationals.   The difficultyin making proper provision in this matter was that the subject was not connectedwith capitulatory rights .(3) That the Foreign Office should be careful to exclude from the present discussion the existing British privilege that Customsdues on British  roods should not exceed122 per cent.,-which also did not fall underthe heading of capitulatory rights.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook to look into the first two points.   As regards thethird he said that the Foreign Office realised theposition:   that the 12-1 per cent, would be excluded
from the present discussion;   but he v/arned thePresident of the Board of Trade that the matter mighthave to be discussed sepa.ra.tely later on.The Cabinet took note of the Memo-randum ^y the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs (C.P.-180 (37)).
from the present discussion;   but he v/arned thePresident of the Board of Trade that the matter mighthave to be discussed separately later on.The Cabinet took note of the Memo-rand urn by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs ( CP.-180 (37)).
PALESTINE. 4. The Secretary of State for the Colonies reportedReport of that many Members of Parliament wished to speak in thethe RoyalCommission. Debate on Palestine, and the Parliamentary Secretary tothe Treasury thought it necessary to allot a full day.(previous reference: There was a difficulty in obtaining, consent to usingCabinet 29(??), Con- a Supply Day for the purpose.   He thought, therefore,elusion 1.)that the best plan would be to put down a substantivemotion endorsing the Statement of Policy issued by His.Majesty&apos;s Government.   He himself proposed, to open the debate, and. the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterwould take part at some stage.   He hoped, that the PrimeMinister would be available for purposes of consulta-tion.   He was anxious to avoid being drawn into detailed discussions at the present stage.   On the whole, hethought that the general line proposed, by the Governmentwould be well received by the House of Commons.   Apartfrom this aspect, the main difficulty at present arose from the attitude of the Government of Iraq., and theintrigues and even terrorism of the Mufti of Jerusalem.The Prime Minister said he would certainly beavailable on the Bench for purposes of consultationdurine- the Debate.^he Lord President of the Council asked, if therewould be any objection to the Debate in the House ofLords taking, place on the day before the Debate in theHouse of Commons.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said therewas no objection.Some further discussion took place, during whichthe importance of Haifa from a strategical point ofview was referred to,The Cabinet were informed that the Zionists werenot likely to object to British control of Haifa forstrategical purposes provided that the sovereigntyremained with the Jewish State.   They were reminded,-8-
however, that so long as Haifa remained under a Mandatepermanent fortification would not be permissible.   Promthis and other points of view it was difficult to refer to the strategical aspect of Haifa when the Report ofthe Royal Commission came before the Mandates Commissionof the League of Nations.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should put down a. substantivemotion endorsing the Statement of Policyof His Majesty&apos;s Government:(b) That, on the assumption that the Beratein the House of Commons would take placeon Wednesday, July 21st, there was noobjection to the Debate in the blouseof Lords taking place on Tuesday, July20th.
THE MEDITERRANEAN.    5. The Cabinet had before them a Note by the assumptions to   Minister for Co-ordina^ion of Defence (C.P.-183 (37))govern defensive preparations.     circulating an extract from the draft Minutes of the296th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence,(previous reference: held on 5th July, 1937, recommending that the followingCabinet 9(37), Con-        new formulae, to govern Defensive Preparations in the elusion 4.)Mediterranean and Red Sea, should be approved in substitution for those adopted at the Meeting mentionedin the margin:-(a) That Italy cannot be considered as areliable friend and must be omitted from the decision of the Cabinet ofthe 15th November, 1933, which says&quot;no expenditure should for the present be incurred on measures of defencerequired to provide exclusively against attack by the United States, Prance orItaly.&quot;(b) That priority in defensive preparationsin Europe should be given to the provi-sion of a deterrent to aggression byGermany, and the decisions to be taken after the receipt of the Review by theChiefs of Staff Sun-Committee of &quot;the strategical situation in the Mediterranean,Middle East and North-East Africa&quot; willhave to be governed by this conclusion.(c) That in the above circumstances no verylarge expenditure should be incurred in increasing the defences of the port3 inthe Mediterranean and Red Sea, but thatat the same time some steps should betaken to bring them up to &quot;date and increase their efficiency.The Minister also attached a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C.I.D. PaperN0.1S3S-B) entitled &quot;Probability of War with Italy&quot;.After hearing an explanation by the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence, the Cabinet agreed  To approve the formulae recommendedby the Committee of Imperial defence and reproduced above.
ITALY, 6.    In the course of the discussion referred to in relations the preceding Conclusion, the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs said that it would be advantageous from(Previous the point of view of relations with Italy, without beingCabinetC29     provocative, if some sign could, be shown in that regionclusionX)   of our progress in re-armament.   He understood, forexample, that there was some question of modern aircraft.. 3t?^7)4 being sent to Egypt, and. this would be very welcome tothe Poreign Office.The Secretary of State for Air said that theproposal to send modern a.aircraft to Egypt had only beenmade as part of a. larger question, namely, as towhether, in view of the letter read, to the Cabinet bythe Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs at the last meeting, referred to in the margin, all three services were to make preparations in consequence of thedisquieting attitude of Italy.   Apart from this possi---bility the Air Ministry did not propose at present tosend any modern aircraft to Egypt, since the Departmentsprogramme was designed with a view to a re-equipment of the Royal Air Force against the menace in northern europe.    In the ordinary way the overseas squadronswould be re-equipped, with material that became surplus to home requirements, though ultimately the &quot;Wellesley&quot;type were intended, ^or service in the Middle East.If the Air Ministry were asked to take special precau-tions in the Mediterranean they proposed to send twoFighter Squadrons and. a Medium Bomber Squadron.   Thiswould involve the use of three ships and would takeThe President of the Board of Trade said that^itwould be necessary to requisition the shipping.-11-
The Home Secretary felt some sympathy with theproposal of the Foreign Secretary, and hoped that some-thing would be done to improve the standard of ourdefences in the Mediterranean.The Secretary of State for the Colonies also support-ed the idea of improving the standard of our defences in.the Mediterranean.   He had received a visit from theGovernor of Malts, who had urged that something shouldbe done to strengthen the defences of that  Island.The Prime Minister recalled that at the last Meeting,referred to in the margin, the Cabinet had agreed thatthe best way of countering the disquieting attitude ofthe Italian Government was to cultivate better relationswith the German Government.   He thought it had been generally understood that, special steps in the Mediter-4-ranean were unnecessary.    If, however, it was thought desirable to make some further display of our strength,the best plan would be that the matter should be raised at the Committee of Imperial Defence.The Cabinet agreed.  That the Minister fo^ Co-ordinationof Defence should br*ing the foreign secretary&apos;s suggestion before the&quot;Committee of Imperial Defence in orderthat consideration might be given tothe best way of meeting it.
&quot;OIFSIGN 7. The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandum&quot;OLITICALiRGANISA-        by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of state for he^UNn^D      Foreign Affairs (CP.-182 (37)) asking that, in viewIINGDOM. .   .   ..,    TTof a series of Questions about to be asked m the HousePrevious        of Commons, further consideration might be given to the reference: ,    *  ,,      .   -       -      .Cabinet 58 proposal contained in CP.-206 (36) that informal and.(36), Con- -       nelusion 9.) friendly suggestions should be ma.de to the German andFCPJlti^fj)^.italian Governments that they should take steps tosecure the closing down of branches of the national socialist and Fascist party organisations established in the United Kingdom, the presence of which wasconsidered undesirable.After describing the present position and functionsof these organisations, the Memorandum continued, thatit woul^ be too much to expect the Governments concerned to take effective steps to disband them, and that themore probable result, of representations would seem tobe one of the following:-(a.) That the Governments would argue that asthe organisations were not breaking thelaw it was unreasonable to expect thatthey should be disbanded:(b) That the Governments would, undertake tobreak up the organisations but that theywould, continue to function underground.The Ministers were convinced that the time had come todecide upon a definite policy of action or inaction,but in their judgment it would, be a grave mistake to embark on any representations, however informal, without being prepared to accept their logical consequences.After hearing and. discussing a statement by theHome Secretary, the Cabinet agreed -(a) That the question could not be allowedto drift indefinitely and must be kept under continuous observation;   but that,ill ln vie;v of the existing difficulties in
securing agreement over questions relating to Spain, no drastic action should be taken at the moment:(b) To dra.v the attention of the HomeSecretary to the need for exercisinggreat care as to granting naturalisation-tion to members or ex-members of the organisations referred to in his memorandum.
NATIONAL 8.  The Cabinet had before them a Note by theREGISTRA-      Minister for co-ordination of Defence (CP.-177 (37))on the subject of National Registration, submitting,Reference: in conformity with a request by the Committee ofCabinet 25(36), Con- Imperial Defence at their 29^th Meeting, the followingelusion 1.) poinfs fop the conSideration of his colleagues:-(a) Whether a scheme of National registration in peace-time is desirable and practicablefrom a political point of view:(b) Whether, as an alternative to (a), theChairman of the Man-Power Committee shouldbe authorised to make preparations in peace-time by the printing of forms and the enrol-ment and instruction of registration officers,notwithstanding that these measures wouldinvolve some measure of publicity:( c) Whether the Opposition Parties in parliament should, be consulted either on (a) or (b) .The discussion on this subject revealed thatthe adoption of a scheme of National Registration inpeace-time had not been deemed practicable from apolitical point of view by the Members of the cabinet who had taken part in the discussion at the Committeeof Imperial Defence.     The alternative of expeditingNational Registration after the outbreak of war by making preparations in peace-time as proposed in (b)above did not commend itself to the Cabinet.     It waspointed out that it would involve a good deal of publicity and was certain to raise political difficulties.The Cabinet were informed that Registrationwas essential to the whole scheme of Man-Power in Timeof War approved by the Committee of Imperial defence and that it would be important from the point of view&apos;of food rationing and air raid precautions (identificationof dead and injured for example).       It was suggested,however, that its value to food rationing had beenexaggerated and that from the point of view of the
mobilisation of industrial labour, Registration was notonly useless but open to objection.     On the whole, theexisting plans for introducing Registration after an outbreak of war were preferred.In the above circumstances, the cabinet agreed:That neither of the schemes of Registrationsubmitted to them in O.P. 177 (37) and summarised above was acceptable.
THE UNION OPSOUTH africa and THE FING.(previous reference:Cabinet 57(36), Con-conclusion ion 15 .)9. The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs (CP.-178(37)) reporting that, as the result of discussion withGeneral Hertzog and Mr Havenga during the ImperialConference, the toast list at Union Governmentbanquets in future would contain only one toast of HisMajesty.    The   Cabinet regarded this as asatisfactory conclusion to the incident described inhis previous Memorandum on the subject (CP.-247 (36)).
10. The Cabinet had befogs them a Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (CP.-179 (37)) statingthat an application had. been ma.de by a Committee of thecotton and artificial silk piece-goods dyeing trade andby the Federation of Calico Printers to enforce schemesof re-organisation prepared, by those bodies, the main features of which included. :-(l) A rationing of production of existing firmsby a quota arrangement based on past output;(2) A prevention of the entry of new firms intothe industry, except by a licence issued byan independent statutory board;(3) A compulsory levy for the purchase of the quota belonging to firms willing to go outof business.For reasons set out in his Memorandum the President had come to the conclusion that he could not recommend thatthese proposals should be made the subject of legisla-tion.   A number of suggestions had. been made with a viewto further re-organisation of the industry, but theserequired further exploration.   He therefore proposed,subject to the agreement of his colleagues, to informthe representatives of the industry that the Governmentwere unable to adopt the proposals quoted above;    thatin the Governments view any proposals for re-organisa-tion should, be directed in the first place to an improve-ment of the export trade;    that schemes with this object-could, be assured of the most careful and sympathetic consideration by the Government;    and that the Govern-ment would, if necessary, be prepared to contemplatemaking proposals for legislation in support of a re-organisation scheme of a kind that was likely to command the approval of Parliament.
The President of the Board of Trade made astatement to the Cabinet on the lines of his memorandum.Towards the conclusion he mentioned that information had reached him to the effect that the Deputation which hadbeen received by his predecessor on the subject wouldbe rather glad if they received no answer at all to their proposals.     This showed that the Deputation had beena failure and that there was no unanimity in the industry.Nevertheless, in view of the promise of the formerPresident of the Board of Trade to consult his colleagues,he felt bound to give a considered answer to theDeputation.In the course of the discussion, the PrimeMinister said that no one would differ from the Presidentof the Board of Trade as to the objections to theproposals made by the Deputation.     He hoped, however,that the President would not refuse to examine schemesfor the re-organisation of the cotton industry which didnot involve the same objections.     He recalled that oneof the difficulties of the cotton industry was the numberof redundant spindles and the lack of up-to-dateness inthe equipment of factories.     He had recently read aReport by the Import Duties Advisory Committee on theRe-organisation of the Steel Industry, which containeduseful suggestions for introducing some measure- of controlover the future development of the industry.     He thought it important, therefore, that the President of the. Board^of trade should only reject the particular schemes, referred to.in his memorandum and not-rule out the possibility of other schemes.The President of the Board of Trade agreed toexercise care in this respect,
Affter discussion,. the Cabinet agreed;(a) To approve the general lines ofthe reply which the President ofthe Board of Trade proposed to make to the Deputation as set forth inhis memorandum (CP. 179 (37)):(b) That the President of the Boardof Trade, while rejecting theparticular schemes that had beensubmitted by the Deputation,should be careful to avoid rulingout schemes of re-organisation which were not subject to the sameobjections:(c) That, before meeting the Deputation,the President of the Board of trade should consult the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer about the proposalfor the establishment of a fundcontributed to by the industry andby the Exchequer for the assistanceof the export trade.
TA 11,   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theI0N&quot;   President of the Board of Trade (CP.-181 (37)) on thesubject of Film Quota Legislation.   At the Meetingce.18     mentioned, in the margin the Cabinet had already agreed on-4.)    that the Cinematograph Films Act, 1927, when it expired&apos;[yj)&apos;2-0- next year, should be extended for a further period of tenyears on the same general lines, i.e., that renters offilms should be obliged, to acquire, and exhibitors toshow, a certain proportion of British films.   The industryhaving failed, to agree upon a scheme, it was now necessaryfor the Government to proceed with their own proposals.In these circumstances the President sought authorityfor the preparation of a Bill for submission to theCommittee of Home Affairs and. introduction in the Houseof Commons early in the new Session?    and. for the publica-tion of a White Paper explaining in some detail theGovernments proposals.   These proposals, as summarised,at the end. of the Memorandum, are reproduced as an appendix II to these Minutes.After a short discussion, the Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the proposal of thePresident of the Board of Trade onthe subject of Film Quota legislation as set forth in GoP. 181 (37):(b) That the President of the Board ofTrade should be authorised to issue a White Paper on the subject beforethe Parliamentary Recess:(c) That the President of the Board ofTrade should be authorised to under-take the preparation of a Bill dealingwith film quotas for submission to theCommittee of Home Affairs with a viewto introduction in the House ofCommons early in the new Session:(d) That the President of the Board ofTrade should supply the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs during thepresent week with material to enable him to answer the representations madeby the Ambassador of the United Statesof America in London which had been takeninto consideration in these proposals,
IS.   The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for India (CP.-184 (37)) reporting that the Working Committee of the Indian national congress had passed a resolution on July 7th   recom-mending that supporters of the Congress in the Provinceswhere that Party had obtained a majority in the legislatures shoul^ be &quot;permitted to accept officewhere they may be invited thereto&quot;.   mhe Secretaryof State felt that there were grounds for satisfactionwith this latest development, which would, guaranteeat least some practical experience of the new Constitu-tion in all the Provinces, and might prove to be aturning point in the history of our dealings with indian nationalism.   The full text of the resolution was attached as an Appendix to the Memorandum.The Secretary of State for India said that theresolution was a matter of considerable importance andmight become a landmark in the relations between thiscountry and India.     He uttered a caveat, however,against premature rejjoiningo     The Left Wing of Congresswas still strong,as could be seen from the wording ofthe resolution and the Government might still be facedwith a serious problem.     For example, he had just received information from Madras to the effect that theperson whom the Governor had asked to form a Governmentwas already raising a point that involved the powers ofthe Governor.     Whether the person in question had actedunder instructions from Congress, he did not yet know.Apart from that, however, the latest developments were satisfactory.The Cabinet agreed:To invite the Secretary of State forIndia to telegraph to the Viceroy,their congratulations to him and to theGovernor on their successful handling of this difficult situation.
THE FAR EAST.Japan and China.(previous reference:Cabinet 51 (35)Conclusion 2.)fTR.3l(37)3.13.     The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,who had postponed making a statement on the situationin the Far East until the end of the Cabinet inorder that he might receive a decipher of the latesttelegrams, reported that so far as could be judged from the information received by the Foreign Office,the present situation in the neighbourhood of Pekinghad not been brought about by deliberate Japaneseinitiative.     The General Officer Commanding had beenabsent and there was other evidence to show that theJapanese had been rather taken by surprise.     Therewas, however, a danger of pressure being put uponthe Japanese Government to take action and both hisown advisers and the American State Departmentconsidered the situation dangerous.     He was keeping in touch with the Government of the United States ofAmerica on the subject.     He was making it clear to both parties that our good offices were available if they were required at any time.     He thought itinadvisable   to take a more definite lead than this at the moment.     He referred to messages that he hadexchanged with the American Secretary of State.2, Whitehall Gardens, S,W,J.14th July, 1937,
APPENDIX I.NON-IITTERVEITTIOIT IN SPAIN.STATEMENT BY UNITED KINGDOM QOVESITIIENT.At the last meeting of the Non-intervention Committee,held on the 9th July, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom were entrusted hy their colleagues on the committee with, the task of drawing up proposals which should aim atclosing the present gap in the control scheme and enablethe policy of non intervention to be continued.     This taskhas been no easy one.      For any proposals which can be putforward with any hope of success must not only harmonise thewidely&apos; divergent views which have been expressed but must also give promise of an effective sj^stem of Non-intervention.His Majesty1s Government have, however, bent their best endeavours to their task, and have evolved a scheme whichthey herewith submit to other Governments represented on theCommittee, in the hope that it nay lead to an agreed solutionof the present difficulties.      In submitting it. they would however make one observation.     It is admittedly a compromise between varying points of view;    it can only be successful ifit is accepted by the Governments concerned in a spirit of compromise.     All the nations represented on the Committeehave repeatedly expressed the view that they wish non-intervention in the Spanish conflict  to continue.     They havenow an opportunity to give to that wish practical effect.Unless a greater spirit of international co-operation is evident than has been achieved in the past, this scheme will fail, and the&quot;nations of Europe will be faced with a new andinfinitely more dangerous situation.     His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom therefore urge other nations represented on the Non-intervention Committee to give to these proposals
their immediate consideration, and in the event of their being accepted, to devote a real spirit of international collaboration to their practical application.OUTLINE OF PROPOSALS.A.
