SPAIN. 2. Thermseeretary of&quot; State for&apos;&quot;Foreign affairs said that he had not a good report to make on thePreviousReference: proceedings of the Non-intervention Committee.    TheCabinet 30(37), Con- Committee had accepted the British proposals as aelusion 1.)basis for discussion and had remitted them for  .R.-hi.(bi)i*:consideration in detail by the chairman s Sub-CommitteeThe latter body had met on the previous day and. had reached, a deadlock on the order in which the questions were to be discussed.    The Cha.irma.n had. wanted the subjects to be considered in the order in which thetwo G-governments in Spain would, be approached.    In the morning his Committee had. appeared to agree to this.In the afternoon they had disagreed.    The Italians hadwanted to take the subjects in the order in which theyappealed, in the vVhite Paper.    Eventually the Sub-Committee had adjourned, in order that the governments might be consulted.    mhe Italian Ambassador had askedto see him (the Secretary of State)  the same afternoon.This point of procedure was a stupid one over which tobreak down.Various suggestions were made for meeting the deadlock; e.g.-(i) That the Chairman of the Sub-Committeeshould be asked to take up the subjects in the order in which they appeared inthe White Paper, on the understandingthat nothing was agreed to until thewhole list had been dealt with;( ii)  That the Sub-Committee should, be askedto adopt, a procedure for which there wasprecedent in the Disarmament Conference,namely, to discuss one subject in the morning and another in the afternoon;(iii)  That the more critical questions, namely,the withdrawal of volunteers and thegrant of belligerent rights, should, bereferred to Sub-Committees which would work and report simultaneously.The Prime Minister pointed out that everythingdepended on whether the various countries wished toreach agreement or not.-S-
The Cabinet agreed  mha.t the question should, be left tothe Foreign Secretary to do his best,taking into account the various suggestions that had been made.-3-
THE PAR EAST.japan and china.3.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat he had no encouraging information from the FarcloseEast.   He had done his best to keep in/touch with theGovernment of the United States of America.   He had(previous reference:Cabinet 30(37). Con-elusion 13 .)    and had informed him of communications he had made toseen the American Ambassador on the previous eveningTokyo and Peking, adding that we were not prepared, togo further alone, for the reason that the- fact thatwe had taken action in mokyo, and the American Government-only in Washington, had given rise in Tokyo to theimpression that, we only were closely interested.On the previous evening the Prime Minister had suggestedthat a last effort might be made to avert war, and hehad accordingly sent telegram No. 239 to Washington,which he read to the Cabinet (Appendix). This, at anyrate, would place on record our offer of joint action with the United Sta.tes Government.
4. The Secretary of State for Poreign affairs recalled that the question of a Loan for Iraq had beenunder discussion ever since 1933 .    It had. always been intended, that it should be secured in one way or another on the oil royalties, but nothing could, bedone until the general embargo on raising foreignLoans in this country was removed.    The discussions between the Iraqi Government and Messrs Baringsrecently led to what appeared to be complete agreement.,and announcements about the impending issue of the Loanon a 4^% basis appeared in the British Press.   At thelast moment, however, a serious difficulty arose overthe manner in which the royalties should, be assigned,and. the Iraqi Government pressed. H.M. Government touse their influence to overcome these difficulties,H.M. Ambassador in Baghdad pointed out that thepolitical consequences might be disastrous if theLoan were not obtained, and. Hols&apos;&quot;. Government, stronglyrepresented, to Baring Bros, the desirability of doing everything possible to facilitate the issue of theLoan without delay.   As the result of these representa-tions Barings were now prepared, to issue the Loan next week at an issue price of about 93 and at        interest.But they had. represented that the success of the Loanwould be greatly facilitated if H.M. Government- could give it a general blessing, e.g., by means of astatement, in reply to a Parliamentary Question, thatit had. their approval   as the proposal has in facthitherto had..The Secretary of State said, that he had brought the matter up because the situation had. been complicatedat the last moment by an unfortunate pronouncement bythe Iraqi Prime Minister against our Palestine policy,which had necessitated a severe protest from HisMajesty&apos;s Government.    It would, of course, he possible
for His Majesty&apos;s Government to refuse permission forthe issue of this Loan, at any rate until satisfactoryguarantees had been obtained  from the Iraqis in regardto their attitude towards the question of Palestine.It would also be possible to refuse to give the Loanany kind of blessing.   This would not prevent itsissue, though it might impair its success.    But either of these courses would be inconsistent with the policyhitherto followed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, andmight well have the effect of bringing about the fall of the Iraqi Government, thus leading to subsequentdisorder without helping the position as regardsPalestine.In all the circumstances the Foreign Secretaryrecommended that, notwithstanding the recent difficul-ties over Palestine, the matter should be proceeded with as originally proposed, and that wre shouldcontinue to do all we could, to facilitate the issue ofthe Loan.   &apos;-Ve should, however, make it clear to the iraqi Government that we were doing more for them thanthey deserved and that they must now co-operate in ourPalestine policy.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to a reportthat most people in Palestine were under the impression that the Iraqi Prime Minister&apos;s statement could, only have been issued with the approval of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment or the Foreign Off ice ( C .P .-193 (37), p.2)..If the Government were now to give some kind of blessingto the Loan,  it was suggested that it would, tend tostrengthen these rumours and give rise to the belief .that the British Government was  conducting its policy by inscrutable methods.
The Cabinet v,ere informe-3 th^t the Iraqi PrimeMinister had been taken sharply to task for his state-ire nt , &quot;&quot;nit as this had been done privately it was recognised that it did not affect the public aspect of the ques t ion.One suggestion was that the date of the issue ofthe Loan, which had been under consideration for a longtime, might be postponed, until the autumn.The Poreign Secretary stated, however, that further postponement could not be made without bringing aboutthe fall of the Iraqi Government.The suggestion was made that the difficulty might be surmounted either by making an explanatory statement in the Hous-e- c-f--^Jc^CTonB....crrvb^LJ^that was given to the Loan.The Cabinet agreed.  To approve in principle the issue of a.Loan to the Iraqi Government by Messrs. Barings^ but. that the Secretary of Statefor Poreign Affairs, in consultation-with.the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for the Colonies,should, examine the possibility of drafting an appropriate statement tobe made by the latter in the House ofCommons the same afternoon in the debate on Palestine, which would indicate theviews expressed by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to the Iraqi Prime Minister.They were also asked, to consider whether there was any way to be found, forfacilitating the issue of the Loan thatwould not be open to the objectionsindicated, above .
kO-PORTUGUESE 5.  The Cabinet had before them a Note by theTTONS. Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (C.P.-189 (37))Previous on the subject, of Anglo-Portuguese Relations, circulatingCabinetC4S an extract from the Minutes of the 297th Meeting of theelusion0?.)       Committee of Imperial Defence, at which consideration had been given to a letter from the Foreign Office(C.I.D. Paper No, 1320-B) and. a Report by the Chiefs ofStaff Sub-Committee (CcT0Do Paper No.l335-B).   Theconclusions reached, by the Committee of Imperial Defencewere as follows:-&quot;(a) To endorse, the conclusions of the Chiefsof Staff Sub-Committee in regard to theimportance of Anglo-Portuguese relationsfrom the strategica.l point of view, namely:-&apos; We conclude that the importance ofmaintaining our alliance with Portugalhas increased with the development ofair power, owing to the fact that, fromthe air point of view, the Mother Countryand her island, possessions in. the EasternAtlantic are admirably situated either for the defence of or attack on ourseaborne trade.We cannot forecast the outcome of theSpanish civil war, but since a return tothe old and innocuous regime appearsunlikely, it may well be that the avail-ability of facilities and anchorages in portuguese waters, alternative to Gibraltar,will prove of greater value to our navy in the future than in the past 0Elsewhere, in Africa and the Far East,it is important that no strong foreign power should be permitted, to develop apredominant influence in Portugueseterritory *From every aspect, therefore, weconfirm the view that the maintenanceof our alliance with Portugal is ofgreat importance(b) That, having regard, to conclusion (a) above and. to the importance of counteracting the growing influence of Germany and Italy onPortugal, the despatch of a British military mission would, on political grounds, bedesirable:( c)  In view of (b) above,  to recommend to theCabinet, that the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should have authority to sound, the Portuguese Government as to whetherthey would welcome the despatch of a military mission to Portugal.&quot;
The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence recalled,that the question of sending a British Military mission to Portugal had been raised, last March in connectionwith an application by the Portuguese Government for arms, and had. been considered, at the Committee ofImperial Defence on April l^th.   At that time theCommittee of Imperial Defence had. expressed doubt as tothe advisability of sending a Military Mission to portugal owing to the fact that the Mission would beempty-handed, so far as the supply of arms from thiscountry was concerned.   The Poreign Office had. beenasked, to &quot;temporize encouragingly without undertakingany definite commitment&quot;, and. the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee had. been asked, to render a detailed Reporton the importance of the Anglo-Bartuguese Alliance froma strategical point of view.   The question of the supplyof war material to foreign countries had also beentaken up.   The Report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee was now available and confirmed the importanceof the Portuguese Alliance and of developing a close contact with Portugal.    On considering that Report theCommittee of Imperial Defence had reached the conclusionsquoted, above, including a recommendation that theSecretary of State for Poreign Affairs should have authority to sound the Portuguese Government as towhether they would, welcome the despatch of a military mission - to Portugal.The Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs said thathe was grateful for the recommendation.The Secretary of State for 7/ar, while accepting therecommendation, warned, the Cabinet that only a verylittle could be furnished, to Portugal in the form ofmilitary supplies.
The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said thattie was not without hope that from time to time it mightbe possible to work some instalments of war material for Portugal into the programme.The Cabinet agreed.  To approve the conclusions of theCommittee of Imperial Defence asset forth above.
ARABIC BROAD- 6- The Cabinet had. before them a Memorandum by theCASTS.Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-185 (37))(Previous suggesting that, with a view to countering ItalianReference:Cabinet 28     wireless propaganda in the Near and Middle East by means(3 7), Con-elusion 2.)    0-f broadcasting from Jerusalem any information which itF.R. vx.(*y)7.was desired to make public, a special officer with first-hand, experience of Arab mentality should, be attached tothe News Department of the Foreign Office,  charged withduties detailed in the Memorandum-    This proposal,however, would not completely meet the case, as Jerusalemwas likely to remain in mandated territory, thus pre-cluding the possibility of the fullest use being made ofthe broadcasting station there.    The real need was a medium-wave sts.tion on British territory.    The cabinet were therefore asked to approve in principle, subject toexamination by the Departments  concerned of the technical and other details involved, the construction of a station in Cyprus, from which all parts of the Levant and theNear and. Middle East could, easily be reached.    The totalcost of erecting such a station was estimated at not morethan  50,000, and the period of erection at approximatelynine months.    The Home Exchequer, however, would have tobear the greater part of both capital and maintenancecosts, as  contributions from Cyprus would be negligible.The question was raised as to whether the establish-ment of a broadcasting station in India, instead of in cyprus, had been considered.Doubts were expressed as to whether the erection ofa station in India would, not involve a good, deal of delay, and also as to whether Arabic broadcasts would come appropriately from India.Doubts were raised both as to whether a stationcosting  50,000 would be sufficiently powerful to proveeffective for the purpose for which it was intended, andas to whether the scheme had been thought out. sufficient-ently from the point, of view of programmes providingsufficient attraction to secure listeners.-11-
A desire was expressed for information on the details-of -who was to be responsible for arranging the pro-grammes, and of the extent to which they would beprovided in Cyprus itself or by relaying, whether from england or elsewhere.The Cabinet agreed.  (a) To approve the proposal that, as animmediate step, a special officer with first-hand experience of Arab mentalityshould, be attached to the News Departmentof the Poreign Office, with the duty, firstly,of following the output of any anti-Britishwireless propaganda, in the Near and middle east;    secondly, of collecting or receivingfrom other Government Departments anyitems of news to which, from the british point of view, it was desirable to give a wide circulation in that area;    and, thirdly,of drafting in news bulletin form any such information or any announcements designedto counteract foreign propaganda.    Thebulletins so produced to be telegraphedto Palestine, where they would, be translated into Arabic and broadcast  from Jerusalem,though not necessarily in the exact form inwhich they were sent:(b) That a Cabinet Committee, composed asfollows  The Minister of Health (in the Chair),The Lord. Privy Seal,A Representative (Cabinet Minister orUnder-Secretary) of -The Treasury,The Foreign Office,The Dominions Office,The India Office,The Colonial office the Post Office  should, enquire into the details of theproposed, medium-wave station at Cyprusin order to satisfy the Cabinet thatthe station would, prove adequate forits intended, purpose from the point ofview both of technical efficiency andthe programmes to be broadcast, andother matters related thereto, such asDepartmental responsibility and. localorganisation.
SOUTHERN 7*    The Cabinet had before them a Joint MemorandumRHODESIA,NORTHERN by the Secretary of State for Dominion^A  ai-ra--aa3jd^.the rhodesia and nyasaland. Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP.-187 (37))Question of     reporting that,  in.accordance with the Conclusioncloser Asso-ciation. mentioned in the margin, they-had discussed the question,.(Previous of union or closer association between Southern and reference:Cabinet 22     Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland with the Prime Minister(37), Con-clusion 4).    of Southern Rhodesia and representatives of northern rhodesia and Nyasaland,      As the result of these discus-sions the two Secretaries of State believed that, whileamalgamation of the territories could not be regarded aspractical politics at the present time,  it might be-possible to devise means of closer co-operation betweenthe Governments of Southern and Northern Rhodesia,  andalso if necessary that of Nyasaland, on many matters suchas defence, transport and communications,  trade andeconomic policy,  and various other questions,  and thatthis was desirable:    but any Inquiry into the matter mustbe on the strict understanding that there could be noquestion of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom modifying in any way the control they exercised over Native policy and administration in northern rhodesia and Nyasaland, nor the reserve powers which theypossessed concerning Native policy in Southern Rhodesia.The Ministers proposed, therefore,  as the next step,  thata letter in the terms of the draft accompanying their memorandum should be sent to the Prime Minister ofSouthern Rhodesia.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs made astatement in explanation of the above proposals, at. theend of which he asked the Cabinet to approve the despatch to Mr Huggins of the semi-official letter attached tothe Memorandum, which contained (l) a statement thatamalgamation was impossible;    (2)  a statement that we
were ready to consider closer co-operation or associa-tion between the territories concerned;    (3) an invitation to Mr Huggins to say whether he would prefer that the examination should be conducted by the three governments concerned, or by a Commission sent fromthis country.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said, thatthe idea, of an Inquiry was welcomed, by the Governor ofNorthern Rhodesia.   He thought that not much progress would be made by a local Inquiry.The Cabinet agreed.  (a) To approve the proposals contained, inthe Joint Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs and theSecretary of State for the Colonies(CP.-187 (37)), including the following documents attached to the Memorandum:-(i) The draft of a letter to thePrime Minister of SouthernRhodesia, and(ii) The Terms of Reference to theCommission (if it should, bedecided, to appoint it) , togetherwith an explanatory statement:(b) That in the event of an agreement toappoint a.

SS^RVSS OFJ50D AND FOOD-ORAGE.previouspfjference:Cabinet 9fS7), Con-elftion 3.)8.  In pursuance of the Conclusion mentioned in the margin, the Cabinet had. before them a Memorandum by theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence (CP.-192 (37))on the subject of Reserves of Food, and Food. Storage,in which he fully explained his reasons for inviting hiscolleagues to take the following action:-(i) To approve in principle a policy ofbuilding up a food reserve to be kept in store.(ii) To adopt as a basis the scheme known asPlan II, which provides, at an estimated,cost of  20,000,000, for the existence inthis country of stocks equivalent to threemonths&apos;   consumption of certain key foodstuffs.( iii) To consider the actual sum to be allocated for this purpose in conjunction with the review of the Defence Programmes of theServices and certain Civil departments which is to take place in the near future.(iv) To authorise the President of the Board ofTrade to proceed with the preparation of adraft Eill on the basis set out in his paper of the 7th July, 193 7 (F0S.-38), viz., theBill  (a) to provide for the setting up of an ad. hoc Commission to carry out theexecutive work of building up andturning over the reserves *(b) to provide for a &quot;Food, and Fertilisers&quot;Fund, by Annual Votes supplemented bypowers of borrowing subject to prescribed,safeguards.( c) to be completed by the 1st November next.The discussion on these proposals revealed, that theCabinet were not willing to approve in principle thepolicy of building up a food, reserve to be kept in store,as proposed, in (i), until after the general conspectusof the expenditure involved, in Defence Programmes duringthe next few years, as approved, by the Cabinet on the30th June (Cabinet 27 (37), Conclusion 2).    There was,however, general agreement that the question of a. foodreserve should be included, in that conspectus.
The Cabinet agreed  (a) That a decision on the principle of apolicy of building up a food, reserve to be kept in store should be postponed until after the conspectus of expenditure involved in Defence Programmes duringthe next few years, as approved by theCabinet on the 30th June (Cabinet 27(37), Conclusion 2):(b) That the proposals for a food, reserves should be brought up as part of theconspectus referred to in (a):( c) That in ca.lcula.ting for the purpose ofthe conspectus the cost of building upa food reserve, the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence and the Presidentof the Board, of Trade should adopt asa basis the scheme known as Plan II,which provides, at an estimated costof  20,000,000,  for the existence inthis  country of stocks equivalent to three months&apos;   consumption of certainkey foodstuffs.    If the principle ofa food reserve were approved, the actualsum to be allocated to this purpose would be liable to be scaled, down asthe result of the general conspectusreferred, to above:(d) That the President of the Board of trade should not be asked at the present stage to proceed, with the preparation of a draftBill, as decided by the Cabinet at theMeeting referred, to in the margin, butthat he should, circulate furtherinformation as to the heads of the bill and the details of his proposals:(e) That when the question of a food reserveis again considered, the proposals of theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheriesfor a reserve of fertilizers, as setforth in CLD. Paper No. F.S.-20,should, not be overlooked.
I THE MARRIAGEBILL.I (MatrimonialCauses Bill.)(previous reference:Cabinet 13(37), Con-clusion 16.)9a   The Cabinet, bad before them a Memorandum by theLord Chancellor (cp-186 (37)) pointing out that the marriage Bill (now entitled the Matrimonial Causes Bill)would, almost certainly be passed and recalling theadditional duties which as a result would be laid uponthe Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division of theSupreme Court, of Judicature, as described in his previous memorandum on the subject (C.P.-98 (37)).   At the meeting mentioned in the margin the Cabinet had taken note thatif the Bill passed into law it would be necessary tostrengthen the Judicial Bench in that Division.   since that date the business of the Division had. increased,involving still further congestion.    The Lord Chancellortherefore proposed that instructions should be given forthe preparation of a Bill asking Parliament to sanction the permanent addition of one Judge to the Probate,Divorce and Admiralty Division, together with the auditionof another whose reappointment should be contingent uponthe passing of a Resolution by both Houses when satisfiedthat the work of the Division was such as to require the vacancy to be filled.The Cabinet approved the proposals of theLord Chancellor as set forth above,- 17 -
10. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary (cp-191 (37)) bringing to their notice a request from the League of Nations for the views of HisMajesty&apos;s Government as to what action the League might take on the question of the political and. civil status of women, which was on the agenda for the next Meeting ofthe Assembly.    It was stated in the Memorandum &quot;rhat whenthe subject came before the Assembly in 1935, in connec-tion with a Convention concluded in 1933 by certain south american States, the discussion revealed considerabledifference of opinion, and it seemed unlikely that theLeague would be ready to endorse any proposal for thepreparation of an international Convention.    Par-reachingdemands might be made for League action   if it should, bedecided, by the Assembly that the question of the status of women, which had. no reference whatever to the subjectof the Nationality of Women, fell within the proper scopeof the League&apos;s activities.    The Home Secretary thoughttha.t the extent to which effect should be given in any state to the principle of sex equality was a. matter forthe domestic laws of that State, and recommended, that the reply to the League and. the instructions to the british delegation at the Assembly should, be based, on the viewthat the League itself should, refrain from expressing anyopinions on the matter and. should limit itself to encouraging-ing the study of the questions involved, by collecting and.circulating information, or by similar methods.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the proposal of the HomeSecretary as set forth above:(b) That the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs, in consultation withthe Home Secretary, should concert atelegrar.:. to be sent to the Dominionsexplaining the views of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom onthe subject.
IRON AND &quot;BELINDUSTRY.Report of import DutiesAdvisoryCommittee.^previous reference:Cabinet 16(35), Con-elusion 9.)11. The Cabinet had. before them a Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (CP.-188 (37)) on thesubject of the Report of the Import Duties AdvisoryCommittee on the Iron and Steel Industry (Cmd.5507), inwhich he drew attention to a recommendation of major importance referring to the desirability of the policyof the Iron and. steel Federation and. its Associationsbeing &quot;subject to some oversight by a body whollyindependent of the industry&quot;, notably in respect of regulation of development, control of prices, and. thepower of Associations to coerce independent manufacturersHe thought, that such oversight was desirable, but thatthe formation of any new body for the purpose would entail serious disadvantages .   He therefore proposed,if his  colleagues agreed, to invite the Import duties advisory Committee to continue for the time being theoversight of the affairs of the industry.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the recommendation containedin the Report of the Import duties advisory Committee on the Iron andSteel Industry to the effect that theindustry should be &quot;subject to someoversight by a body wholly independent of the industry&quot;:(b) That the President of the Board of trade should be authorised to invite theImport Duties Advisory Committee tocontinue, for the time being, theoversight of the affairs of theindustry:(o)   That the President of the Board of trade should make a statement in parliament on the subject before the Recess.
12.     The Cabinet had before them a memorandum bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP. 193 (37))circulating extracts from letters from the High&quot;Commissioner for Palestine to the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies on the presentsituation in Palestine and Transjordan following thepublication of the Report of the Palestine RoyalCommission.      These letters referred among othermatters to the possibility of the arrest of the Muftiof Jerusalem and Auni Bey.The Secretary of State for the Coloniesrecalled that he had circulated a number of telegrams to the Cabinet about the proposed arrest of the Mufti.The present position was that the Mufti had eludedarrest from which lie was practically secure so long ashe remained in his official residence and did not go beyond the precincts of the adjacent Mosque of Aksa.He read to the Cabinet a private and personal telegram which he himself had sent to the HighCommissioner for Palestine on the 20th July, togetherwith the reply thereto.    Prom these it was clear that itwould not be practicable on political grounds to sendMoslem police to effect the arrest of the Mufti withinthe Haram area;    ;that Moslem police who could be trustedto carry out such a duty were not available;    that considerable loss of life would be involved in an arrestby means of forced entry and that a military plan hadbeen drawn up some months ago to surround the Haramarea and to enter the Mufti&apos;s house, but that now thatthe Mufti was suspicious the High Commissioner and theGeneral Officer Commanding considered that he wouldquickly escape into the Mosque of Aksa where it would

14o     The Secretary of State for Air, who wasto wind up the Debate in the House of Lords on thesubject of the Report of the Royal Commission on it.Palestine, asked for instructions from the Cabinetaa to what line he was to take on a question that had been raised in connection with minorities.What would be the extent of the responsibility ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government for maintaining order inthe event of disturbances raised by minoritieseither (i) inside one or other of the proposed newStates or (ii) acting across the frontiers of theState?     One possible answer was that our responsibility would be defined in the treaties withthe Jewish and Arab States, but the question wouldbe raised as to whether, as the former mandatory,we remained responsible for preventing persecutionor restoring order.The Secretary of State for the colonies said he hoped that the criticism would be met bythe following words at the end of the Marquess ofDufferin and Ava&apos;s speech in the House of Lords onthe previous day, viz:-&quot;Furthermore, the guarantee of peace betweenArab and Jew in the future in Palestinewill be assured not merely by specifictreaty relations between Great Britainand both States, but also by our continuedpresence in that land*&quot;He doubted if more need be said at the presents tage.The Lord President of the Councilsuggested that the House of Lords might be reminded that this was a question which was certain to beraised at Geneva.

He thought he might deal withthe subject, however, on the lines proposed by theSecretary of State for the Colonies.The Prime Minister asked the Secretary of Statefor Air to be careful to avoid committing us too deeplyin this matter.The Secretary of State for Air said that hehad a good deal of ground to cover in his speech andhe would avoid the subject unless he was pressed strongly.

APPENDIX.Cypher telegram to Sir Ro  Lindsaj&apos;&quot; (Washington).Foreign Office.    20th July,  1937.    9.00 p.m.No. 239.MOST IMMEDIATE.His Majesty&apos;s Government are gravely preoccupied by recent developments in Far East and have been considering whether one more effort cannot be made to averthostilities which may have far-reaching consequences.In the circumstances we should be willing to make withthe United States government joint approach to japanese and Chinese governments and ask them to agree:(1)    to issue instructions that all further move-ment of troops be suspended;(2) to agree that the United States government and ourselves should put forward proposals in attempt to endexisting    deadlock.Please arrange to see Mr. Hull at once and ask himwhether he agrees with such a course of action andwhether he would join   with us in it.     We appreciate that the chances of success may be slender, but in viewof serious consequences to prosperity of Far East and to peace in those regions which must result from a clash between armed forces of Japan and China,  we considerattempt should be made.      It will be clear that ifapproach is to be made it should be done with least possible delay.
