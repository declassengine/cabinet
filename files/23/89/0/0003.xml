MOROCCO.Extra-Terr it o-rial rights in.(previous reference:Cabinet 30(37), Con-elusion 3 .)1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs recalled that at the Cabinet Meeting on the 14th July,referred to in the margin, he had raised the question of extra-territorial rights in Morocco, and a short discus-sion had taken place at the Cabinet.   He was now glad to report that the negotiations had been successfullyconcluded and that an Agreement would, be signed on the morrow.    It was satisfa.factory also to record that HisMajesty&apos; a Government in the United Kingdom had securedall their desiderata,   The French had been more accommo-dating to us than they had been to other Governments.Satisfaction was expressed, at, the above report.

THE FIVE-POWER       3. mhe Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsCONFERENCE.referred to a new Note which, he had recently sent to the(Previous       Governments concerned in the Five-Power negotiations, and.Reference:Cabinet 18   which had already been circulated, to the Cabinet.   He did(37), Con-clusion 1.) not expect any rapid development of the situation to arise from this Note, but it would, serve to keep the questionalive and might bring about some progress.
SPAIN(previous reference:cabinet 3157), Con-conclusion   2.)If4.   The Secretary of State for Poreign affairs informed the Cabinet that the States represented, on theNon-intervention Committee had. been asked to send, inwritten comments on the chairman s scheme, and it was hoped, that these would be received, at the Poreign office the same afternoon.    The Non-intervention Committee wasto meet on Friday.   The question would also be raised inParliament on Friday, July 30th, and. he wished, to consult his colleagues as to the line he should, take.   He pro-posed, to repeat what he had already said, that the planmust, stand or fall as a. whole and that we could, acceptno major changes.   For example, we could, not grantbelligerent rights without the withdrawal of volunteers.That was a point by   which we must stand.    It was possible,however, that the plan might not be adopted,    in that eventsome other nation might make fresh proposals.    It wasconceivable,for example, that it might be proposed, to dropboth belligerent, rights and. the withdrawal of volunteers and to adhere to the Naval patrol, reinforced, by trawlers,as the German representative had once proposed, and byobservers in the Spanish ports.   Another possibility wasthat the whole scheme of non-intervention might collapse,though no-one desired, that.    In fact, the french ambassador, who had. recently visited Paris, had. informed,him that the French Government wished to avoid, theabandonment of non-intervention.    In the event, however,of a breakdown, it was impossible to forecast what thecircumstances woul^ be or what our attitude should be,and he did not want to be committed.The Prime Minister said, that the Opposition would,demand pledges that there should, be no grant of belligerent-ent rights to General Franco unless volunteers were firstor simultaneously withdrawn.The Foreign Secretary agreed that that pledge couldbe given so far as the Chairman&apos;s plan was concerned,
but we ought not to give the same pledge if the whole scheme should break down.The Secretary of State for Air recalled that in theearlier discussions of the Cabinet the view had. beenthat if General Franco should occupy more than half thecountry we might in any event accord belligerent rights.At that time the capture of Madrid was suggested as the test.    He suggested that if General Franco capturedMa.drid, and. perhaps extended his authority much more widely as the result, we should not exclude the possibilities-ity of according belligerent rights.The Foreign Secretary agreed that that would be anentirely new situation.The Prime Minister agreed that we should keep our hands as.free as possible.mhe President of the Board, of Trade suggested thatif the Government were to announce in the House ofCommons that, their pledge on the subject of belligerentrights must not be regarded, as applying necessarily to anew situation, that might well be taken by the DictatorPowers as a hint of a change of attitude on oar part.Tn that event they might work for a breakdown of non-intervention in order to secure belligerent rights forGeneral Franco.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought this points good one.   He agreed, that unless it was made clear thatthe according of belligerent rights was linked up withthe withdrawal of volunteers the Dictator Powers mightwell take it as a. hint.The Prime Minister pointed out that there .were allsorts of other considerations with which these pointscoul* be linked.
The Lore President of the Council suggested thatthe Foreign Secretary might take the line on this point that it was impossible to predict what new situation might arise or what would have to be done to meet it.   He might-suggest,    also,     that our policy was based on themaintenance of non-intervention and the avoidance ofentanglements.The Prime Minister suggested that the line to betaken by the Foreign Secretary should be to make clearthat we should not agree to any modification in the plan which would destroy its balance, but that- beyond thatthe Government could, not tie its hands in circumstances that could not be foreseen.   He thought it possible thatin the Debate on Friday the Government might be askedto give a pledge that before according belligerent rightsthey would, summon ^oth Houses of Parliament to meet.    the answer to that would be that this was a matter for theGovernment an* that the House of Commons must trust themto summon Parliament- if circumstances required it.This was agreed to.
mr? par eastjapan and china.(previous reference:Cabinet 315. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs recalled that at the Meeting referred to in the marginhe had. reported, that he had sent a telegram to Washingtonsuggesting joint action with the Government of the UnitedStates of America with a view to averting war in the Par(37), Con-clusion 3.)    East.   After some delay the American Secretary of StateFR3A-(^r?)J had. made clear that he was not prepared for joint repre-sentations to China and Japan as he thought they wouldhe liable to exacerbate the situation.   He himself,however, had made his own representations to Peking andTokyo.    On the previous day, on receipt of grave reports from Peking, he had. telegraphed to &quot;okyo to try andrestrain the Japanese Government, and had asked, theUnited States of America and. some other Powers to take similar action.   He gathered from the Press that theAmerican Secretary of State had made representations to china as well a.s to Japan.   He regretted to report thatthe outlook was now bad. and. for the moment he couldsuggest no further action that  could usefully be taken.The Prime Minister recalled that the American secretary of State&apos;s refusal to co-operate had not beenowing to an objection in principle to joint representa-tions, but on the ground, that it was not likely to proveuseful on the present occasion.    It. was only fair thatthe Cabinet should note the distinction.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that atthe time of the Shanghai a.ffa,ir the position had beenreversed,   ^he United States Government&apos; had. made propoaalsto us for joint representations that did. not  commend,themselves, and we had preferred, to proceed independently.The Lord President of the Council expressed the hopethat if the crisis in the Far East developed unfavourablyand it was suggested to bring the matter before the Leagueof Nations, we should lose no time in making clear thatwe did not regard a reference to the League as useful.-7-
The Foreign Secretary said that hints to this effect had already been given in reply to Questions inParliament, and he did not. think that a reference to theLeague of Nations would he pressed.   He proposed, however,to see the United States Ambassador and to discuss withhim as to whether any further useful action could be taken the Prime Minister expressed the view that  jointrepresentations by the British and United States Govern^ments were likely to produce more results than simultane-ous and parallel representations.    It would be deplorableif any major war were to develop.The Foreign Secretary reported, that some of hisexperts  considered it possible that there would be no major war, but a long period, of skirmishes interspersedwith parleys -
THE POREIGN 6.    The Prime Minister said that as this wasSECRETARY.likely to &quot;be the last discussion of foreign affairsbefore the Parliamentary Recess, he would like to remind.his colleagues of the exceptional pressure of work towhich the Poreign Secretary had. been subjected more orless continuously for a. long time.   He paid, a tribute tothe skill, patience and. ability with which he had dealtwith the situation, and expressed the hope that he would.be able to take some holiday.The Prime Minister&apos;s remarks mot withunanimous approval .
ARABIC BROAD-       7.    The Minister of Health, as Chairman of theCASTS.Cabinet Committee on Arabic Broadcasts, reported that(Previous        the question was to be considered on rather broader linesReference:Cabinet 31    than in the Papers laid before the Cabinet last week   at(37), Con-       Meetingelusion 6.)   the/referred to in the margin, and it had become neces-prft.^ 37)7 -   sary to send communications to India, and elsewhere.In order to give time for these communications and adequate preparation, he had decided not to summon theCommittee until^^fti^-September.The Foreign Secretary reported that the temporaryscheme would be put in operation towards the end ofAugus t.The Cabinet took note of, and approved,the above statements.
SOUTH AFRICA. 8. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theHigh Commis- Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (CP.-197 (37))sion Terri-tories. relating to the question of the transfer to the Unionof the High Commission Territories in South Africa,^previous reference: viz., Basutoland, Eeehuanaland and Swaziland.   HeCabinet 29(^7), Con- recalled, that at the end of his talks with Generalelusion 5 .)Hertzog during the Imperial Conference   in which thelatter had charged His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom with deliberate dilatoriness in carryingout that policy   he had. promised to send, to the General,on his return to South Africa, a letter setting forth the Governments views on the subject and. makingsuggestions as to means of implementing further thepolicy agreed between him and the then Secretary ofState in 1935.    The crux of the problem was how to reconcile the implication in Section 151 of the SouthAfrica Act, 1909 (which successive Union Governmentsregarded as constituting in effect a. pledge by theUnited kingdom Government that the Territories would.eventually pass to the Union Government) and the claims of the Union Government with the pledges given to thelocal populations and to Parliament.    The Secretary ofdraftState attached, to his Memorandum a/letter which he submitted as a first step in a policy of (i)  endeavour-ing to restore the confidence of General Hertzog and hiscolleagues (most of whom were more reasonable in thismatter) in the good faith of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom;    (ii) of re-establishingconstructive co-operation;    and. (iii) of doing anything else that could properly be done to help to bring abouta situation in which, in the words of the Aide-Memoireof 1935 (Cmd.4948),  &quot;if transfer were to become a matterof practical politics, it. could be effected with thefull acquiescence of the populations concerned&quot;,-11-
After hearing and discussing a verbal statement bythe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, the cabinet agreed  To approve the general lines of the draft letter to General Hertzog, attached to cp.-197 (37), subject to the following:-(i)  Such alterations in the form of theletter or in its details as theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairsmight deem advisable after communicationwith the British High Commissioner inSouth Africa:( ii) On page -3 of the draft letter,  considera-tion to be given by the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs to the following words :-&quot;the withdrawal, or relaxation,of the weight and other restric-tions imposed, in respect of the entry of cattle from the Territoriesinto the Union&quot;,in order to make it clear that &quot;other restrictions&quot; was not intended to refer to restrictions owing to the outbreak of contagiousdiseases:(iii) Page 8, lines 16 to 23:    considerationto be given by the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs to a suggestionthat the letter might contain a. promise that British Officials in the territories would be instructed to explain to theNative Chiefs the meaning of the documentreferred to in the paragraph.
(The Secretary for Mines entered, at this point.)COAL POLICY.Unificationf Royalties.Lord. Hastings&apos;Scheme.(previous reference:Cabinet 22(37), Con-elusion 6.)ft)]-9. The Cabinet had. before them a Note by thePresident of the Board, of Trade (CP.-196 (37)) on thesubject of the Unification of Coal Royalties, in whichhe stated that the Cabinet Committee on the Organisationof the Coal Mining Industry, at their Meeting on July20th, had. decided, that the question of the attitude tobe adopted, by the Government towards a scheme which had recently been put forward by Lord Hastings should bereferred, to the Cabinet.   Attached to the Note was aMemorandum by the Secretary for Mines, with which thePresident was in entire agreement, and. a copy of LordHastings&apos;  draft scheme.    After outlining the course ofthe negotiations with the Executive Committee of the mineral Owners Joint Committee and. describing the draft scheme, the Secretary for Mines suggested, that both on political an^ financial grounds Lord. Hastings&apos;  scheme,which would, not fulfil the Government&apos; s policy ofunification under public ownership, was quite unaceept-able, and. that he should, be given authority to informthe royalty owners in that sense in a letter the termsof which might be agreed, between his Department an^ theTreasury.The Secretary for Mines said that he had received information that the Royalty Owners had met on theprevious day and had approved. Lord Hastings&apos;  scheme as a policy acceptable to them for carrying out thepolicy of unification of royalties, although they had.not committed, themselves to the details of the scheme.At the same meeting, however, the Royalty Owners had agreed, that there would he no objection to theirexperts talking with the Government&apos;s experts on thedetails of the Government&apos;s plan, though their expertswould not be allowed to commit their principals.
In reply to the Prime Minister he said that he stilladhered to the view that Lord Hastings&apos;  scheme was politically impracticable and financially unacceptable.The President of the Eoard of Trade mentioned thatthe Hastings Scheme had. not yet been officially receivedfrom the Royalty Owners, which created a slightly awkwardsituation.   A copy, however, had reached the Departmentunofficially, and. as this might be the last Meeting ofthe Cabinet before the Parliamentary Recess he had thoughtit necessary to obtain a decision on the subject, foruntil, the Royalty Owners had. been informed, of the C-overn-ment&apos;s attitude towards the Hastings Scheme they wouldnot negotiate on the Government&apos;s scheme.   He understoodthat no amendments to the scheme had been made at themeeting of the Royalty Owners on the previous day.   Whenthe Scheme was received officially it. would be necessaryto explain to the Owners that the Government had hadcognizance of it and had thought it best in the circumstances-stances to take a decision on it before the Recess.   he agreed in the views of the Secretary for Mines.   He re-called that the principle of the Governments scheme hadbeen proposed by the Owners themselves.   After all that had happened it woul^ be politically impossible.for theGovernment to go back on the past and start again on anew scheme.The Lord President of the Council agreed that boththe Owners and,the Government were too much bound up inthe machinery of the past to go back.   After explaining the difficulties which were liable to arise in the Houseof Lords, where various interests might well combineagainst the Government, he urged the following:-( i) That regard, should be had. to the importance attached, by the Royalty Owners to the HastingsScheme, and that for this reason the -reply should be carefully framed so as to show thatit had been thoroughly considered:i
f ii) That the Government should&apos; go as faras possible to meet the main contentionof the Royalty Owners, namely, that the ownership should not pass to a statutoryowner until after the compensation dueto each had been ascertained and paid.The Secretary of State for India supported theLord President of the Council in the view that a strong opposition would develop in the House of Lords.    It was true that the Royalty Owners had agreed to the tribunal,but. the &quot;Greene&quot; Award, had come as a shock to themand. they did not regard it as a fair one.   He supported the Lord President1s proposal that the reply to theRoyalty Owners on the Hastings Scheme should, be couched in as friendly terms as possible, more especially as agreat, deal of trouble had been taken in the preparationof the scheme.   He agreed that the Scheme was not now a possible alternative, but was anxious that, it shouldbe shown how carefully the Scheme had. been considered.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that theHastings Scheme was utterly unacceptable and impractica-ble from a. Treasury point of view .    One reason why theGovernment&apos;s scheme appealed to the Treasury was thatthe money  could be raised now at a cheap rate.    Theycould, not agree to a. delay involving the raising of alarge sum of money at a later period when the same ratemight not be obtainable. Neither would it be practicable to raise the money now and. keep it until it. was required without having acquired the property which was to provide the necessary security.    TheScheme, therefore, was not a practicable one.    mheRoyalty Owners seemed to have forgotten the pasthistory of the case.    If the Award had. been for, say, 120,000,000, the Royalty Owners would never have putforward the Hastings Scheme.   He agreed that the terms
of the letter to the Royalty Owners must be friendly,but. it must, be made quite clear that the Scheme wasimpossible both from a practical and political point ofview .Coming now to the question of what could be done^he suggested that as the award gave the government good bargain they might consider whether some alleviation could be found.   A possible plan toconsider would be to give the dispossessed, owners ofroyalties, as from the vesting in the State, interest on unpaid, compensation at 6.66$ (the rate corresponding to the &quot;Greene&quot; Award of fifteen years&apos;  purchase)  insteadof 4$ down to a date like July 1, 1940.    The essentialmatter, however, was not to depart from the principlesof the Government&apos;s plan.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence urged,that there must not. be a hiatus in time during which theRoyalty Owners would be deprived of interest on their property.The Secretary of State- for Scotland, quoting as a.precedent the case of the Award of the Royal Commissionon Tithes, which had subsequently been altered in favourof the tithe-owners, urged, that the Government should notbe too rigid.The President, of the Board, of Trade agreed, that the answer to the Royalty Owners should be courteous andconsiderate, but it must put beyond, all doubt, that theGovernment could not accept Lord Hastings&apos;  Scheme; first,owing to its defects in detail, and, second, because aposition had been reached, where both sides had agreed toa global payment, as suggested, by the Owners, and it. wouldbe impossible to go back on this.   He agreed, with the-16-
Lord President&apos;s proposals, for the reason that theGovernment had always hoped, that they might be able todeal with Royalty Owners who were friendly to the scheme.If the &quot;Greene&quot; Award had. been of a different characterthis might have been possible.    Now, however, theRoyalty Owners were hostile.    So, while maintaining themain principles of the Governments scheme, he thoughtthat the utmost shoul^ be done to meet the grievancesof the Royalty Owners .The Lord Chancellor said that he had. never beenin favour of unification of royalties.    The Governmentwould take the property and never give the owners itstrue value.    The difficulty was that until compensation was assessed, and scaled down to what, was possible underthe global figure, no-one would know what the interestamounted, to.    Consecuently during this period, the royalty owners  could get no interest.   He agreed that it would bevery difficult to go back from the Governments scheme atthe present stage.   He warned the Cabinet, however, thatit would be very difficult, to get the Governmentsscheme through the House of Lords if the Royalty owners were hostile.   He thought, therefore, that the Governmentshould do their utmost to mitigate their grievances.mhe Prime Minister said that the Hastings Schemewas so different from the scheme on which the Governmenthad. been working that to adopt it would involve a totalreversal of policy.    That would be impossible.    It shouldbe recognised that the Royalty Owners had met. with dis-appointments.    Consequently the Secretary for Mines should put his reply in considerate terms.    On the main issue,however, it was  clear that the Royalty Owners were trying to get better terms than were provided in the award.The assessment in the award had proved smaller than the Government had expected, and evensmaller than the Government ttiemselves might have been
willing to pay.    Consequently there appeared to be thepossibility of a bargain:    but. care must be taken to avoid the .. criticism from political opponentsthat the Government were making concessions to their ownfriends .    &quot;&quot;he details should be left to the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, the President, of the Board of Trade andthe Secretary for Mines.The Lord Chancellor asked, that the Cabinet shouldrecord that they did not accept the Hastings&apos;  Scheme.The Prime Minister agreed.The President of the Board of Education urged thatthe Hastings Scheme should be rejected on merits and. noton the ground that it was too late to retreat from thepresent scheme.The President of the Board, of Trade agreed that theHastings Scheme must be criticised in detail, but urgedalsothat it wa.s essential/to make the point that, the present-scheme had advanced too far for the Government to go backon it.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That Lord. Hastings Scheme was not. acceptable:(b) That when the Scheme was received officiallyfrom the Royalty Owners, the Secretary for mines, bearing in mind that the Royalty owners had. suffered disappointments, when rejecting the Scheme, should do so in friendly andconsiderate terms.    The letter should make clear that the Hastings Scheme had. receivedcareful consideration.    The objections to itshould, be set forth in detail.    The royalty owners should also be reminded of all that had passed on the subject, which made itimpossible for the Government to withdraw from the position that, had been reached:( c) That the Chancellor of the Exchequer, thePresident of the Board of Trade and. theSecretary for Mines should consider the &quot;  &apos;.possibility of reaching an agreed compromisewith the Royalty Owners .(&apos;The Secretary, for Mines then withdrew .)
LONG--TERM 10.    The Cabinet had before them, the Report (C.P.-195AGRICULTURALPOLICY. (37)) of the Cabinet Committee on Agricultural Policy,Milk and which had been appointed at the Meeting mentioned, inBacon.  the margin to consider the long-term agriculturalReport ofI cabinet policy of the Government a.nd to make recommendations .I Committee.After describing briefly the important measures alreadyI (Previous taken in regard to Meat, Cereals and Sugar Beet, theI Reference:Cabinet 28       Committee attached, to their Report recommendations onI (37), Con-elusion 3.)      the Governments long-term milk policy, in the form of/Trt.33(*7)^ draft ^.5^ Paper entitled &quot;Statement on Milk Policy&quot;(Appendix I), which, subject to the approval of theCabinet, it was proposed to lay before Parliament beforethe Adjournment:    and conclusions in regard to bacon,in the form of a draft Answer to a Private notice question ^Appendix II), which, if the Cabinet approved,it was proposed to give in the House of Commons beforethe Ad journment.Statement The Cabinet first discussed, the draft vVhite paper on MilkPolicy. entitled &quot;Statement on Milk Policy&quot;.   The discussionf^R 1-1 /35?) /2- -t-   &apos;    mainly concerned, the Tables in paragraph 13 showing therates of premium which the Milk Marketing Boards wouldbe required to pay in respect of the various categories of quality milks and the Exchequer contributions thereto.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said, thatthe Chancellor of the Exchequer in Committee had reservedhis agreement to the last column of the Table.. He had.agreed: that to give the long-term milk policy a fairstart, there should, during the early years of the scheme,be a contribution from the Treasury which was to be of a diminishing character.   He had pointed out, however, thatthe proposed. Exchequer contribution in respect of Milkfrom Attested Herds (last column of the Table) was not   &apos;
on a diminishing scale, and he had proposed that theExchequer contribution for the fourth and fifth years should be substantially reduced..    The Minister of Agrieul-ture and Fisheries was afraid he could not accept the chancellors suggestions.    The Milk Marketing boards would say that, the scheme represented too heavy a financial burden to be made up from the Pool, and. thatconsequently they would oppose the scheme from the start.Even if they accepted the scheme with a bad. gra.ce, hesuggested, that during the early years of its operationthey would, think it necessary to build up financialreserves to meet the cost of the fourth and. fifth years .That could only be done by raising the price of milk,which was open to many objections.    It had been apprehend-ed that the producers might even be led. to revoke the milk scheme, which they had the power to do, and thiswould be a disaster of the first magnitude.    In order to resolve this difficulty he suggested that the rates of premiums and Government contributions should stand, as inthe present mable for all three classes of milk for thefirst three years, but this should be followed by astatement that for all three qualities, assistance wouldbe continued for the fourth and fifth years.    It should,further be stated that the Government contemplate thatthe aggregate cost to the Exchequer in those years inrespect of the three qualities would be on a diminishingscale.   Subject to this, the incidence of premiums and.contributions as between the Pool and the Exchequer wouldbe determined by the appropriate Ministers, with theapproval of the Treasury,
in the light of a Report to he made by the PermanentMilk Commission during the three years.The Chancellor of the Exchequer expressedsympathy with the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries in this complicated matter.     He pointed out, however,that the proposal the Minister had just made was anentirely new one.     The passage at the beginning ofparagraph 2 of the draft White Paper explained thatthe Government desired to see the dairy industry ofthis country self-supporting and profitable and thatit was with this object in view and in order to bring-to full achievement the efforts that dairy farmershad themselves been making to improve the quality oftheir product,  that they proposed to invite Parliamentto provide additional Exchequer assistance.     that paragraph had been inserted at his request and he was grateful for it.     Paragraph 13 showed the applicationof the principle.     The idea had been that theExchequer contribution should taper off in the later years.      This was well illustrated by the first and second columns (Accredited Milk and T.T. Milk)respectively, but in the third column (Milk fromAttested Herts) his original proposal had been that inthe fourth and fifth years, the Exchequer contribution towards Milk from Attested Herds should be   ^d.and  d, instead of ifd for each year asshown in column 3.     That then would have illustrated the policy very well.     A difficulty in the new plan of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries was that
his words seemed to hint at the possibility of thecontinuance of the Exchequer contribution after thefive years.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesread his proposal once more to show that this was notthe case.The Minister of Health suggested that thefirst two columns (Accredited Milk and T.T. Milk)might stand as in paragraph 13 and that the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries&apos; proposal might apply only to the third column (Milk from Attested Herds).The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought thatthis would lead farmers to think either that the schemewas to end after three years or else that it might continue beyond the five years.     He thought it v/ould be better to show that the scheme would run out at theend of five years.The Chancellor of the Exchequer then suggestedthat the difficulty might be met by re-editing thedraft White Paper so as to leave the first two columnsof the Table in paragraph 13 intact and to follow thisby a separate paragraph dealing with Milk from AttestedHerds and indicating that the Pool premium and theExchequer contribution for the fourth and fifth years would be subject to prior enquiry.The President of the Board of Educationsuggested that the need for such enquiry might be linked up with the question of how much progress hadbeen made on the policy of cleaning up the herds.
The Chancellor- of the Exchequer did not objectto that proposal but wanted something to show that it was intended to continue the Exchequer contribution for thefourth and fifth years only.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesagreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s proposalprovided a way out, but he would prefer a statement onthe lines that he had suggested.The Prime Minister pointed out that in thecase of column 2 (T.T. Milk), there was no taper afterthe third year.      In column 1 (Accredited Milk), thetaper was in the third year and the fifth year.     Hethought there would be less uneasiness in the industryif the first two columns were retained and showed the pool premium and Exchequer contribution for the fiveyears.The Minister of Agriculture and fisheries said that, in these circumstances, he would accept.The question was raised as to whether NorthernIreland was to be included in the White Paper and theCabinet were informed by the Chancellor of the exchequer that the subject was under consideration departmentallyand still had to be negotiated with the Government ofNorthern Ireland^      It had been decided, in thecircumstances, not to mention Northern Ireland in theWhite Paper.(For Conclusions on the Milk Policy - see below.)Bacon. The Cabinet then discussed the proposals in regardto bacon and reached the conclusions given below.*   - 23 -

(The First Commissioner of Works entered theCabinet.)HEW GOVERNMENT 11* The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the offices in whitehall. First Commissioner of Works (C.P.-194 (37)) pointing out that the need for proceeding with the building of(previous reference: the new Government Offices on the Whitehall Gardens siteCabinet 7(37), Con-        had become increasingly urgent:    that the scheme wouldelusion 5.)n/   Str-   not begin to make any substantial demand upon the supplyof skilled building labour until after the date on whichit is assumed that the Defence Works programme will be approaching completion, when in all probability therewould be an adequate supply of skilled, building labour for the execution of the scheme: and that the Ministerof Labour agreed that the scheme need not be furtherdelayed, on the score of his negotiations with theBuilding Industry.    The First Commissioner thereforesubmitted that as the scheme was one of high priority,approval should, now be given to a start being made upon it without delay.The Secretary of State for Air said that heand the Home Secretary, who was absent on official duty,both considered that some further consideration shouldbe given to the question of air raid precautions inthe new Government building.     It was true that thelargest types of armour piercing bombs could penetrateto the bottom of the building, but it appeared desirablethat fairly adequate precautions should be appliedto reduce the risks from smaller bombs.     It would bedifficult for the Government to appeal to localauthorities to adopt such precautions in the buildingsthey were erecting if a lead was not given in the new government building,(The Lord President of the Council left at this6 point,)Moreover, the criticism of the Government for providingnew buildings instead of moving Government Departments
Into the provinces would he strengthened if it could&quot;be pointed out that the Government building was n&amp;t a central and threatened point in the event of war, andthat proper precautions were not being taken.     A certainamount was already being done in this respect but hethought the matter should be further considered.The Minister of Health thought that thematter had been examined by the Cabinet Committee andthat the idea of providing against air raids had been rejected after careful consideration.The First Commissioner of Works pointed outthat considerable precautions were being taken.      Therewas to be an underground basement capable of holding4,000 people for refuge purposes or 600     people at work,and which would be gas and splinter proof.The Secretary of State for War raised the point that the new building would house some 4,000 peopleinstead of 400 now housed on the same space.      In  corres-ponding buildings,        the local authorities were empoweredby recent legislation to provide parking places for motor-cars.     He pointed out that the new building would attract large numbers of people in motos-cars,  forparking which there would be no available space.     Hesuggested that the First Commissioner of Works should consider converting the underground part of the buildinginto a garage.The First Commissioner of Works said that thepolicy of the Department was to discourage Civil Servantsfrom coming to their work in motor-cars.     There was sufficient parking space for visitors to the new building.
The Cabinet agreed:(a) That the First Commissioner ofWorks should be authorised tocarry out his proposal to makea start on the scheme for new government offices in Whitehallwithout delay, as suggested inhis memorandum CP. 194 (37),subject to the following:-(b) That officials of the Home Officeand the Air Ministry should discuss the plans of the new building with officials ofHis Majesty&apos;s Office of Worksfrom the point of view of any.alterations that might bedesirable as regards air raidprecautions:    and(c)     That, if the suggested additionsshould be of such a character asto involve expenditure, the treasury should be consulted.(The First Commissioner of Works withdrew at this point.)
