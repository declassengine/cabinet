(Paper CP.-573) and a Memo-ranchim by the Minister of Agri-culture (Paper CP.-643),  dealing with a scheme for the utilisation of the tides in the River Severn.It was pointed out ihat, while at present it wasImpossible to formulate definite oonolusions and it wouldbe necessary to continue the preliminary study of theproblem, for some time, the Government occupation of theBeachley peninsula afforded the opportunity of anticipatingpossible future exorbitant demands in respect of land and facilities for access.    The scheme proposed would Involvethe construction of a dam or barrage across the estuary,which would have the advantage of providing additionalrailway and road transit between the West of England andSouth Waled,The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the desira-bility of bearing in mind the important fishery interests involved.The Cabinet were agreed on the importanceof doing everything possible to facilitate the experiments, and referred the questionof minimum reservations for considerationby&apos;the President of the Board of Trade,the Minister of Transport,  the ShippingController and the Chancellor of theExchequer;    it being understood that the reservations indicated by the Board ofTrade should, be provided for, unless by so doing the Government were thereby pre-vented from securing a very much biggerprice for the remainder of the property.AVERAGE GRAVITY   (a) With reference to Cabinet 8 (SO), Appendix III (3),0?

i!SP opANIMALS INCHEMICALWARFARESEARCH.0 1 critical was pointed out that, as a result of previous    &quot;&apos; &apos;&quot;   .Cabinet decisions,  certain firms of brewers in GreatBritain were prevented from brewing high quality beersxand that in this respect they were handicapped as comparedwith Irish brewers,  the present average maximum gravity inIreland being 105lOas against 10440 in Great Britain.    TheGovernment&apos;a policy enabled the Irish brewers to capture the English market for stout,   and destroyed the trade con-connections of their English rivals.    It was alleged that, inthe absence of stronger beer, the consumption of spirits was increasing.    The removal of the restrictions,  it was held,was not likely to lead to a rise in the average gravity of ordinary beers,  as,  owing to the high price of raw materials,it did not pay the general brewer to put up the gravity tothe maximum allowed.    It was s,tated to be administrativelyimpossible to discriminate between the brewers of the specialbeers and to impose extra taxes upon them.It was suggested that in the Intoxicating Liquor(Regulation) Bill the Licensing Commission should havepower to regulate gravities within certain limits.The Cabinet decided  That the matter should be dealt with either in the Intoxicating Liquor(Regulation) Bill, or at the time ofthe Budget Statement, whichever camefirst.(3) With reference to Cabinet  10 (20), Appendix II (v),the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the HomeSecretary (Paper CP.-761),  in which it was stated thatthe Lav/ Officers advised that the Cruelty to Animals Act,1876, did not prohibit the experiments in question, andthat there was nothing in the Act to prevent the HomeSecretary from issuing his licence for such experiments.The question, therefore, whether these experiments couldbe allowed was entirely one of policy.It was pointed out that it would be quite possiblefor our late enemies to carry on laboratory experiments in
(4) With reference to Cabinet 11 (SO)Conclusion 7,, theCabinet had before them a. -Memorandum.by the President of thesecrett and unless&quot;&apos; we jm^eecuted similar researches we mightpresently find ourselves in a very perilous position.    Itwas argued that nothing was more likely to prevent wars infuture than the realisation on the part of the people thatsuch wars would be fought by ruthless methods of wholesaleextermination by gases.The attention of the Cabinet was called to the clause in the Treaty of Peace which condemned gas warfare and pro-hibited Germany from resorting to it or preparing for it.In view of this provision^ were we oxxrselvea  justified inconducting similar researches which we condemned in thecase of the Germans?    On the other hand, it was stated that france and the United States of America were already making arrangements on a large scale to study chemical warfare, andthat we could not allow ourselves to fall behind.It emerged in the course of the discussion that inthe Memorandum on Army Estimates the reference to experiments in chemical warfare had so far excited no comment.The Cabinet decided  *(a) That the matter should be raised by theBritish Representative on the League ofNations, who should indicate the viewof the Government to be that this new method of warfare ought never to havebeen employed;    that we should rejoiceto see it stopped;    that if it is notstopped it would be necessary for us, in self-defence, to keep abreast of othercountries in research and preparationsin.order to defend our soldiers and metereprisals:    at ihe Same time, the Govern-ment hopes that the League of Nations willdiscover an effective means of putting anend to such warfare:(b) That., before a final decision is reached,the British Representative should refer the matter back to the Cabinet:(c) That.,   in the meantime, the Secretary ofState for War should be allowed to con-tinue the present researches licensedunder the Defence of the Realm Act,  onthe understanding that they are conducted&apos;on the narrowest possible scale and in theroost unobtrusive manner..
AT IF IC AT IONJOF TREATIESI? PEACE *Board of Trade  (Paper CP.-497),  and a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs  (Paper CP.-642),dealing more particularly with the disposal of the surplusfunds accruing under the Egyptian Cotton Control Schemewhich it is estimated will amount to some  4,000,000.It was suggested in the Board of Trade memorandum that the Egyptian Government might properly be asked toagree to the surplus being apportioned equally between theBritish and Egyptian Governments, i.e., that the principle which had heen agreed upon as to a possible loss under thescheme should be applied to the realised surplus.    TheEgyptian Government and the Foreign Office, however, tookexception to the proposal that any portion of the surplusshould accrue to the British Exchequer,  on grounds of expedi-enoy rather than of equity.    In the present disturbed stateof Egypt any allocation of the surplus to the British exchequer-quer would be condemned as exploiting the Egyptian growers,and would increase the difficulties of Lord Milner*s Mission.The Cabinet decided  To request the Foreign Office and theBoard of Trade to furnish them with further particulars as to the exactnature of the agreement between thetwo Governments,  and as to who atpresent actually holds the surplus.(5) The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the necessityfor the immediate ratification of the Peace Treaty withAustria (Paper CP.-619),  and a further Memorandum regardingthe advisability of the ratification of the Peace Treaty with bulgaria,  and the &quot;Minorities&quot; Treaties with Czecho-Slovakiaand the Serb-Croat-Slovene State (Paper CP.-738).It was explained that an undertaking had been givento the House of Commons that Treaties would not be ratifieduntil the House had had an opportunity of discussing them  at least,  if there had not been a definite promise, a generalbelief prevailed that what had been done in the case ofGermany would he done in the case of the other enemy countr-ie
On the other hand, the time of Parliament was so, fully allocated already that it would only be possible toprovide -foT-^ach dtsoue-sion ---by--arr^nging a Saturday sitting.It was felt to be undesirable to delay ratification simply because of the difficulty of securing a g^tiefacrto-ry -attend-ance of Members on a Saturday.The Cabinet decided  That an effort should be made to dealwith the matter in the House of commons before Easter,  subject to the Dominionsagreeing to ratify in those cases in whichthey had not already done so.$ATOM (6) With reference to Cabinet 11  (20),  Conclusion 1, theCabinet took note of the following decisions of the supreme council (Paper CP.-729):-(a) That Datura should, be a Free Port underthe guarantee of the League of Nations.(b) That for the present an Allied compositegarrison should be maintained at Batum,consisting of one British,  one French,and one Italian Battalion.The Cabinet decided --To ask the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to arrange with the Allied Govern-ments concerned for the payment of the costof maintaining the garrison by means ofsome local impost on the inhabitants ofBatum.(7) The Cabinet had before them the following documents:-A Letter from Sir M. Delevingne (Paper CP.-527),A Memorandum by the Minister of Labour(Paper C.P.-592),A Letter sent in pursuance of decisionsof the Supreme Council by the PrimeMinister (Paper CP.-718),Replies of the Secretary-General, Leagueof Nations (Paper CP.-742) and of theDirector-General of the InternationalLabour Office (Paper CP.-750).The Cabinet took note of the fact that,in virtue of a decision of the supreme council, tbe.Council of the League ofNations had been invited to initiateand conduct an enquiry into conditionsnow prevailing in Russia.EMISSIONTO enquire into LABOURCONDITIONSIN SOVlwj

1.     -3%*- -Gortf*rr&amp;nQ&amp; had under-Hjonsdjis ration $memorandum by the Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries (CP.683) covering certain letters from theChairman of the Royal Commission on Agriculture, andrequesting the authority of the Cabinet to a suggestedreply (See Appendix %  in which it was stated that,in view e*f the resignation of the Chairman and sixother Members of the Commission   on the ground thatthe majority of the Commission had resolved to embark upon the examination of a long list of subjects not included in the terms of reference  &apos; it would be theduty of the Minister of Agriculture to represent tothe Prime Minister that the Commies ion-should bebrought to an   end.The Conference agreed to approve the proposeddraft reply, with slight verbal amendments. *      The Conference had under consideration the interim report of the Committee on the De-Control ofPoou (CP.655)  together with a supplementary memo-ranauai by the Chairman of the Committee (C.P.655A).The authority of the Cabinet was required to therecommendations of the Committee relating to certainfoodstuffs(i)    Bread Subsidy.      It was explained that therecommendations of - the - Committee-,  that the price of &quot;the4 lb. loaf should be raised to 1/- would effect a saving to the Exchequer on the Bread Subsidy of over  10COOOa day.      It was also proposed to raise the extractionof flour from 7 7$ to 80$ both on the ground of economy and
2 2 2and in order to effect  i BXxghi^^iMpT^rvmie^lt-^iM&apos;tin?nutritive- quality of bread.The Conference agreed, subject to th&amp; consentof the Prime Minister -(a) t^ approve the recommendation of the Committoe:-that the price Of the 4-lb. loaf shouldbe raised to l/-, and that the extractionCf flcur should be raised-Jto 80$ simul-taneously with the rise in price, on theground that a higher extraction wouldprovide better broad, that it would effect a saving on the wheat subsidy, and thatthe prevention of the deterioration, andadulteration of flour is urged in a memorial to the Minister of Health froma large number of Members of Parliamentincluding the most influential! membersof the Labour Party and of the medical profession.(b) that the announcement of tho two deoisionsReferred to in (a) above should be made&apos; simultaneously in the House of Commons so soon as the Chairman of the Wheat commission had reported to the Lord Privy Seal that theannouncement might be made;(o) that the Wheat Commission should have discretion, if they thought fit, to carry the increase in the extraction of flourby stages.(ii) Wheat Prices.    The Conference had under consideration the following recommendation of the Committee in regardto the ppioe of wheat;-That an announcement should be made to the farmers on behalf of the Government in the following termsIt is hoped that before the Autumn of 1921tho Importation and control of the prioeOf wheat by the Government will have ceased,and that farmers will secure the benefit ofa free market at world&apos;s prices.So long as wheat is still controlled, and thereby deprived of a free market,  the con-trolled price of homo-grown wheat of soundmilling quality., harvested in 1921, will bothe average (o.i.f.) price, for the twelvemonths ending August 31st, 1921, of imported wheat of similar or comparable quality, pro-vided that the price so paid to the home-grower shall not exceed 100/- per quarterof 504-lbs.
It was stated that farmers would he guaranteeda minimum priee lor wheat in the Bill promised bythaPrime Minister and now under consideration by theMinistry of Agriculture.      The present proposals didnot give a minimum but guaranteed that the Governmentwould hot so exercise their control of wheat as togive to the farmers less than 100/*- per Quarter whenthe-aVeraii^maricet erica of imported wheat, o.i.f.was at or above that figure.    Some such announcement was necessary in order to carry out the polioy of theMinistry of Agriculture to increase the arable area in this country, and to prevent a widespread laying down of land to grass, which was already imminent.Some discussion took place-as to whether theproposals of the Committee went far enough.    It wassuggested that, inasmuch as the Increased price wouldnot take effeot until the harvest of 1921, it would beunjust to those farmers, who at considerable sacrificehad grown wheat on their land for the harvest 1920and who would not receive the benefit of the higher price, while those farmers who did not sow wheat until next winter &quot;would   reap the full benefit.    Emphasis was laid on the faot that farmers who complied with therequirements of the law are now compelled to sell the whole of their wheat at the Government price and tepay a higher&apos;price themselves for food-stuffs for thaircattle.In reply to the suggestion that farmers ought not to be robbed of the benefit of a free market, andshould he in a position to obtain as much for wheatas the farmers in foreign countries, it was pointed outthat a large part of the high price paid for foreignwheat was caused by exchange, insurance, and freight,
and that, in many oases, the foreign farmer had received,or was actually receiving,  lees per quarter than Britishfarmers.      The justification for himiting the maximum price to 100/- was that our farmers ought not to been abled to make an advantage out of the world shortageof wheat, and must expect to have their profitsrestricted in the same way as coal and shipping profits.Some discussion took place as to whether itwould not be possible to omtend the increased price&quot;io the 1920 harvest, but it was pointed out that, on theone hand, 85^ of the wheat was already sown so that noincreased acreage  would be obtained, while, on the otherhand,  if the new price    were to come into operation as early as the Autumn of this year, ,tho result would be to cause the immediate holding up of all grain from the 1919harvest that had not already boen threshed.The Conference agreed:-to approve an immediate announcement by the Minister of Agriculture in theterms of the formula recommended bythe Comznittoe.Tho Conference agreed:-to approve the following, furtherrecommendations of the Committee,on Food Control: .(iii) Butter.    That the price of imported butter shouldbe put up at once to not loss taan 3/- per lb.the ration to remain unaltered^(iv) Cheese.    That cheese should be . de-controlled.,(v) Pigs and. Pig Products.   That homo-grown pigs and pigproducts should bo de-controlled on March 31st.(vi) Meat.    That owing to the administrative difficultiesof de-controlling meat in England and retaining con-trol&apos; in Scotland, and Ireland, English home-grown meatshould not be do-controlled.(vii) Ireland.  That tho Irish Office be requested to carry &apos;out the instructions of the Cabinet in respeeb ofdo-c control.-(a) In relation to tho de-control of pigs andpig products referred to in paragraph (v) above:(b) By making effective the de-control of Irishbutter by March 31st.-4-

OOPXUTEHNATION- 4.     The Oonfjftxeiioe had before it the following       -UAh LABOUBCONFERENCE     dx*o-umants;AT WASHINGTON.Report by the British Offi-ciai Da-la-gateson the First International Labour Conference&quot;&apos; &apos;held at Washington, D.C., October-Movember1919, with a covering note by Mr. G.N.Barnes.(CP. 377).Supplementary Report &quot;by Mr. G.NPBarnes.(CP, 595).Mr* Barnes in Ms Supplementary Report called attentionto the six Draft Conventions and the six&apos; recommendations adopted at Washington dealing respectively with:-(1) Eight Hours Day and 48 Hours Week in industry.(2) Unemployment*(3) Employment of Women.(4) Employment of Children.(5) Certain dangerous processes.The Gonferenoe agreediTo refer the Heport to the Ministry ofLabour, the Home Office and otherDepartments ooncernsd for the preparationof the necessary Draft Bills to giveeffect to the recoxujaendations of theLabour Conference;    such Draft Bills tobe submitted later to the Cabinet forapproval together T^ith any proposalsfor administrative action to giveeffeot to the findings of the LabourConference.\\\\\\\\\\\\
CRIMINALS.   (5) With reference to the question of Farcriminals   -alsed as a matter of urgency, it was stated that the French were prepared to delete the names of Hindenburg,  Ludendorff and Bethman-Hollwegfrom their list  provided that the British would removeTirpitz from theirs.      This placed us in rather a difficult position inasmuch as although the exclusion-sf Tirpitz would not mean that we considered unre-restricted U Boat war-fare justifiable,, yet it x^reventedus from pressing for the trial of officers who hadobeyed Tirpitz&apos;s orders.      \&apos;e should still insist how-ever on the trial of officers who had exceeded their orders by firing on drowning persons etc.      The conference was also informed that the French and the Belgians were making considerable reductions In their lists and wewere making a proportionate reduction In ours - thisstill left us with a substantial number of names.    Itwas the view of the Lord Chanellor that we should not insist on the inclusion of Tirpitz&apos;s name in ourlist.Attention was drawn to the fact that theAdmiralty felt very deeply on this subject and took theview that unrestricted submarine warfare was started by ,Tirpitz in the hipe of bringing the war to&apos; an   end.Such warfare was a heinous crime and ought to be punished.      Our own officers would not have carried out such orders had they been issued by the Admiralty.On the other hand it was stated that on thebasis of Tirpitz1s &quot;Memoirs&quot; a good case could be madesut that he wr3 not finally responsible for the unrestrlc-ted U Bsat warfare inasmuch as the policy was actually
approved b.y the German. Jumper or &quot;before being carried into effect.      In any case the final decision must havebeen taken by the  Government of the day.It was suggested that we might inform germany that we considered unrestricted U boat warfare anoutrage against humanity and someone ought to be punished;    a prlma facie case had been made out againstTirpitz hut if the Germans thought anyone else was more responsible than he was they should Inform us.To this it was objected that the germans would probably reply that the It boat warfare was a legitimate answer to our blockade, and it was significant that the Committee in Berlin which had recently been examining the conduct of the War had concentratedattention solely on the ineffectiveness sf the U boatwarfare and not on its moralityEmphasis was laid on the point of view that by giving up our case against Tirpitz the security ofthese Islands might be surrendered as it would mean wehad tacitly accepted that there could be no control -werU boat warfare in future a suggestion was made that we might cbtain fromthe German Government an admission that they consideredunrestricted U boat warfare and the Lille, transportationsIllegal.The Conference decidedthat subject to the approval of thePrime Minister the Lord Chancellor wasauthorized, if pressed, to delete tlaename of Admiral Tirpitz from the Britishlist of War Criminals-
IHB PRESENT^ 6. The Coafer-ence had before it a memorandumSITUATION INGERMANY. by the -General Staff on the present   riivuation InGermany (CP.632),  together with a note by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP.671)  in regard toone of the suggestions put forward by the GeneralStaff, vi2       that the Allies,  and Great britain in the first instance,  should raise a loan for thesupply of raw material oc Germany.It was pointou &quot;at that no loan couldbe raised for such a purpose ^v,, but that steps must betaken to revive German industry Lf&quot;thi&amp; present GermanGovernment was to be kept in existence, and it wassuggested that the British representative on theReparation Commission should be instructed formally to propose to the Commission.that it should authoriseGermany to seek a credit from neutrals of a limited amount,  say  50-^000yOOO, which would have to be given priority over Reparation claims and Army of occupation costs.While there was general agreement that s^meaction on these lines was necessary, considerableobjection was felt tc anything which would give theappearance that the British Government was takingthe initiative in the matter and it was agreed thatany instructions sent to the British representative should be in the nature of a private letter, not tobe communicated to the Commission.It was suggested that the question couldmoat conveniently be appraached by pointing out thatthe proppects **f obtaining reparations from Germany were dependent on immediate steps being taken to restoreGerman industry by the supply &apos;-.f raw material and theproposal could then be put forward as a means towardssecuring the reparations.
Shat the Chancellor of the Exchequer should send Sir John Bradbury a copy of the Memor-andum by the General Staff and inform him that His Majesty&apos;s Government s/ere desirousthat generous use should be made of theprovision for German reconstruction containedin Artiole 835 of the Peace Treaty.   (See Appen-dix ii),7* With reference to Cabinet lx (20), Minute \2),-iBs^JGonfwonce-had before it the Report of the Committee,convened by the First Lord of the Admiralty (CP.714)to consider the question of evacuating refugees from south Russia   and a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor $ar on the shipping required in the Near East (CP.674;It was explained that the proposal to transport the wivee and families of Denlkinfs officers to the crimea would not afford them adequate security and could not be regarded as a fulfilment of Sir H.Mackinden&apos;s pledgee    The Admiralty Committee recommendedthat a number - estimated at 10,000 - should be transported to Salonika, Cyprus and Egypt and thiswould be a literal fulfilment of the undertaking given.Shipping was available, but the cost would have to bemetj^y^he--J3rltd^ ;iriLth-any-a ssistancewhich could be secured from the other -Allies.It was pointed out that such assistance wasnot likely to materialise and that whii*. we Oouldtransport these unfortunate people out of the dangerzone, we could not- undertake -to malntainuthem-i^^and this should be made clear to them at the outset.The Conference agreed ; -To approve the recommendations madeby the Admiralty Committee, subjectto Instructions being sent by the FirstLord of the Admiralty to the Commander-in-Chief In the Mediterranean to make clear to the refugees that they could notbe maintained IndefJLndL&amp;ely by the BritishGovernment
NAVY ESTIMATES. 8. With reference to Finance-Committee 20,Minute 1,  the Conference had before it a Memorandumby the First Lord of the Admiralty on Navy estimates and Naval Policy (CP.645).The Conference agreed to the estimatessubmitted by th:   First Lord, on theunderstanding that the number of capital ships to be kept in commission would be reviewed early in the next financial year.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.V.I.,26th February, 1920.

Commission had resolved to-embark upon the examination oflf,Anker Simmons.jHenry Overman,    a long list of further subjects which are not includedin the terms of Reference,  and for the consideration ofwhich the composition ef the CeaimiB3icn could not be con-sidered sufficiently representative or otherwise appropriate-ate.&quot;The first of these subjects, upon the consideration*f which the Commission proposes to embark,  is that of&quot;Security of Tenure,&quot; and with regard to this it has announced its intention &quot;to go fully into the matter andto consider it in all its bearings as it affects theAgricultural industry&quot;.This decision is in effect a refusal to accept theofficial definition of the scope of the Reference which1fras communicated to you,  on the authority of the PrimeMinister, by sir Arthur Boscawen in his letter of July27th last.

ir William Peat.report on the economic question, and for this reasonthey piaced on the Commission no direct representa-tives of land-owners Put an equal number of repre-sentatives of agriculturists and labourers.    It wouldbe manifestly unfair that these question, which pro-foundly affect the interest of land-owners. Should beconsidered in the absence of any representation of them.The Government realise that evidence on these subjectscannot be excluded altogether,  in so far at leastaa it may bear on the economic position of the industry,but they are ef opinion that if there is to be the full examination and consideration of these questions itshould be undertaken by a separate Royal Commissionerpecially constituted for the purpose.&quot;With regard to the remaining subjects which the Commissiondesires to add to the terms of its Reference, I do not under-estimate their importance but a3 they have nearly all been ex-haustively examined and fully reported upon, very recently, by theAgricultural Reconstruction Committee presided over by LordSelborne, and are already being dealt with under the administrative and legislative programme of the Government, it does not seem necessary or desirable to trouble the Commission to consider themafresh.In these circumstances,  and in view of the other reasons which you advance, I have come to the conclusion, after the most carefuland arocious consideration,   that it will be my duty to represent to.the prime Minister that he should advise His Majesty to release the Commission from its duties, and to bring its proceedings toa cl03e.At the same time,  I desire to express the cordial thanks ofthe Government for the zeal,  care and ability which you,  as Chair-man,  and all your fellow commissioners, have devoted to the con-sideration of the questions dealt with in the Interim Report sub-mitted on December loth, and to assure you that your joint labourshave contributed most ueefully to the solution of a very important and urgent problem.Beli ir-ve me,Yours very faithfully,
(APPENDIX II)ILETTER mm THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUERj -     -     -TO SIR J.  BRADBURY.Treasury Chambers,Whitehall,S. W. 1.February 26th, 1920.My dear Bradbury,I enclose fox your confidential information amemoranducFof the General Staff circulated to the Cabinetby Mr. Churchill and a note x upon it by myself..    these papers were yesterday considered by the Cabinet.    they thought it undesirable that I should give you any formalinstructions on the subject or that you should raise itvith your colleagues on express instructions from your government.     At the same time they agreed with the view expressed by the General Staff as to the desirability inthe interests of the Allied Governments of maintaining theauthority of the present German Government in preference to the only possible alternatives, and they agreed further in viewing with considerable anxiety the present economic position of Germany and,the stagnation of her industrial life.The provision of article 235 of the Treaty whiohcontemplates that Germany shall be allswed out of her firstpayment such supplies of food and raw materials as may beconsidered necessary to enable her to meet her obligationsftjr reparation was inserted in order to provide a remedy for this state of things,,   and they wished me to inform youpersonally that they are quite prepared for and will readilyapprove any arrangements which you and your colleagues onthe Reparation Commission may make for the restorationof-German industry in pursuance of this article.      they attach great importance to the resumption of german economic life and production not only on political groundsbut as being essential to. the ability of Germany to meetthe just claims of the Allies upon her.Yours sincerely,(3d.) AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN.I CP. 631.x    CP.571.Sir John Bradbury, G.C.B.
