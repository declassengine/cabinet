(if Vj^Th-t*ef^^rxjc--^r-Oa^net. 10 (SO),  Conclusion 5,156the Cabinet had before them a MeiiwrandUnrby &quot;the Secretaryof State for War (Paper CP.-674)  covering a Note by theGeneral Staff, which urged that the provision of shipping for the withdrawal of troops from saturn and for the repatria-tion of troops due for demobilisation from Egypt and the black Sea should take precedence over the provision ofshipping for the evacuation of Russian refugees from south russia.It was stated that the Supreme Council were pledged to set up an Independent Armenian State,  and they were agreed that,  in order to provide Armenia and Georgia withan outlet on tho Black Sea and to prevent internecine strifein future,  saturn should be constituted a free port under theLeague of Nations.    The only other possible port was Trebi-zond, but only 5 per cent, of the population of that regionwas Armenian.    It would be impossible to carry out the policof the Supreme Council if the evacuation of Batum took placeimmediately,  and the only result would be a general scrimmagebetween Georgians, Azerbaijanian     Armenians,  and general denikin.      Since the Cabinet decision on February 11,  our forces at Constantinople had been strengthened by the arriva]of a Battle Squadron from Malta,  and to that  extent thewithdrawal f&quot;bm Batum might be held to be less urgent on military grounds.    The  political case for remaining at Batumhad,  in the meantime, been strengthened by the decisions ofthe Peace Conference.The Cabinet were reminded that  it had been decidednearly a year ago to evacuate the  Caucasus,  and that withthe exception of Batum the evacuation was practically com-pleted.    The growing danger of our position at Constantinoplehad made it necessary to concentrate forces there.    Theprime Minister,  in the Debate on the Address, had assured the House of Commons that  our forces were being rapidlywithdrawn from Datum.    It would be some months before the
-realrv^rit^^rkey was oono^ru&amp;exi^aj^-any mo-re months beforep the league of Nations&apos;-wxruld be in a position to take eff.-?ot-ive control of Bat tun.    In the meantime there night be arising there, ,and our small force would be imperilled,   andthere would be a demand for reinforcements and an indefiniteextension of our occupation.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated thatthe evacuation of saturn had in fact begun, but  for a week or two it would be delayed for want of shipping.    In his view it was unsafe to leave our force in Batum much longer,and we were running risks at Constantinople by the delay.The Cabinet decided  (a) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should propose to the supreme council that a mixed international force under British control should be formedat once at Batum,  and should hold the townpending its transference to the League ofNat ions:(b) That,  pending a decision on this proposal,the evacuation of Batum should proceed nofurther,&quot;ES FROM       (2) With reference to Cabinet 7 (20),  Conclusion 2, the russia.Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the First Lord ofthe Admiralty (Paper CP,-562) and a Note by the  Secretaryof the Cabinet  (Paper CP,-581).The Cabinet were informed that urgent appeals werebeing received to evacuate refugees from the Crimea,  andit was imperative that definite instructions should be sentto our Naval Corcmander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean.    Diffi-culties had been experienced in executing the guaranteesgiven by Sir H. J. Mac-kinder, on the lines of fhe cabinet decision (Cabinet 7 (20)  ), as the refugees whom the guaran-tees covered could not be distinguished from others, andGeneral Denikin did not regard the Crimea as a safe retreat.The Cabinet decided  That the First Lord of the Admiralty shouldconvene a Conference the following day ofrepresentatives of the Admiralty, War Office,Foreign Office, Colonial Office, Ministry ofShipping and the Treasury,  to consider the
-whole position and report to the Cabinet,it be4jxgr understood that,  beyond executing(I&apos; Sir H. J.Maokinder&apos; s guarantee as far aspossible, no financial obligations shouldbe put upon the Treasury.jfe-li? (3) The Cabinet were informed that the Capture of Odessahad been accompanied by terrible massacres 4 and that Archangelwas threatened by a like fate ve&quot;y shortly.ELL (4) The Cabinet had before them a Note on the question ofEnzeli and the Defence of Persia, by the Secretary of Statefor War,   covering a Memorandum by the General Staff (paper cp.-647).Authority was requested by the General Staff for thedespatch       to the General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia,of a telegram warning, him to be prepared,  in the event of thenaval command of the Caspian&apos; passing to the Bolsheviks,  forBolshevik aggression against Persia from the Caspian,  andfor an attempt to use Enzeli as a base for propaganda andpossibly serious operations.    The telegram added that itwas considered that the detachment now at Enzeli, with the aid of reinforcements available in North Persia and some additional artillery, would probably suffice to deterBolshevik naval forces from attempting a serious landing,and that,  if this did not prove to be the case, the detachmen-should be able to make good its retreat without much diffi-culty.    The General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia, was accordingly to make arrangements to offer a bold front to theBolsheviks at Enzeli, but, as there wag no intention of holding on to Enzeli if that place were seriously attacked,he was to provide for a safe withdrawal in the event of suchattack, the Enzeli force,  during withdrawal, endeavouring todelav the Bolshevik advance by every means at its disposal,The Cabinet authorised the Secretary ofState for War to forward the telegram tothe General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia,as proposed.-3-

Recruitment ofLocal Services (e.g., trams, gas and electricity) would beundertaken primarily by the Local Authorities.    The recruit-ing of labour for National Services (e.g., food, transport,shipping) would involve the establishment of some 80recruiting centres, each of&apos;those centres to cover the surrounding areas in such a way that all the areas taken together would cover the whole country.    At each centrethere would be a recruiting and co-ordinating office,staffed by the local officials of the National services concerned,  and under the charge of a Chairman (who shouldbe a person of considerable local standing) assisted by aCommittee of local representatives of the National Services.The local recruiting offices would be grouped in 12 divi-sions, under 12 Commissioners, and the 12 Commissionerswould be responsible to a central Co-ordinating Committeeand a Controller in London.The Report of the Committee also proposed that the chairmen and officials who would form the local RecruitingCommittees should be taken into the confidence of theGovernment and informed of the nature of their dutiesbeforehand.The Cabinet decided  T o aut her i s e t he Mini st e r of Lab ou r totake action in aocoidance with the pro-posals contained in the  Report.
The Cabinet took note of the fact that the proposals made in the Memorandum by the Minister of labour had beenagreed to by the Treasury and had received the supportof the Supply and Transport Committee;    and they decided  To approve the decision of the Supply andTransport Committee expressing approvalof the recommendations contained in theMemorandum by the Minister of Labour.i&apos;    -6-J^r^l?^- (9) The C^i^et-had before them a Memorandum bv thefuIKB..

T164MINUTES of a Conference held at 10,  Doming Street,at 12 Noon,  on 6th February,  1920, regarding demands to be made by Deputations cf the National Federation.(Ji of Discharged and demobilised Sailors and Soldiers,the Comrades of the Great V/ar and the national association which the Prime Minister was receivingthat after noon,,The Conference had before it a summary of the questions to be raised by the Deputation from the Federation,klillUGf      fl)    It was explained that the Federation of Discharged andDemobilised Soldiers and Sailors and the Comrades of theGreat War were very jealous of each other.    The former Bodyprofessed to have one million members but it was believed thatin reality they had nothing like that number.    The Comradesof the Great &apos;7ar Association had between 500,000 and 600,000and this was the more moderate Body of the two.    although these Deputations would raise a number of points that afternoonthe question in which they were interested most was that ofthe training.    These Bodies complained that there were not-enough facilities for training disabled men and thoughtthat all the national factories, should have been used fortraining purposes..      At the present moment, trader the Ministryof Labour Scheme,   27.000 men had been trained, (including broken-time apprentices,  42,000J 20,000 were awaiting training, and17,000 were in training at the present moment.The Ministry of Labour was endeavouring to obtain further Factories for those awaiting training but thistook time as before a building could be used far training purposes various Departments had to be approached andtheir consent obtained.The Treasury had to be approached regarding Finance,the Office of VJorks regarding the acquisition of the
Factories arid the Disposal Beard for plans,  it t^oksome time before a Rational Factory could be equipped for training $ purposes.    It was suggested, that what waswanted wars a, big organiser who could give his  servicesana work in conjunction with the Minister of Labour,    ^hisman should take over the whole question of training the disabled soldiers and have money placed at his disposalen a war. emergency basis.    When the first grant wasexhausted he should be allowed to come to the Treasuryfg-jf a further grant.     6, COO, 000 had been allotted inthis way to the Board of Education for the training ofwasofficers and &quot;is/thought something sim.il.ar should bedone for the men.private employers had been approached and were,  infact,   training a number cf men,  but the objecticn tothis plan was that in many oases the men act no training at all as the employer put them to worn on cheap repetitive-tion processes.    Where, however,   the Mini atry ofLabour could ensure that a man would get proper supervisionprivate employers haa been used.Figures were then given regarding the number of officers who had received a course *f training,,.. either in Agriculturevr at the Universities or other training institutions,  andit appeared that 4l,GCO officers had so far been trained,  &apos;Comment was made on the fact that the figure of men trainedcompared very unfavourably with that of the officers,Mr. currie of the Ministry of Labour was  then askedto make suggestions for speeding up the machinery fortraining disabled men:.Mr, currie said - there were tv.6 great difficulties -(1) the delays in obtaining factories and adapting thenfor training purposes and (2)  the difficulty in obtainingpermission of the skilled men in trade unions for the admission into the trade of disabled men when trained.For ex amp I e,  th e /&apos;
Ministry of Labour had agreed upon a scheme with the executive cfthe ArS.y. regarding the admission of Disabled Ken into the Engineer-ing trade, but this  scheme had been rejected by a ballot of the mencIt was essential to get the skilled men to modify their- attitude inthis respectsAs regards the money required for these schemes, he had nothing to complain of in the gross total which the Treasury had sanctioned,but he thought that the Ministry of Labour might be allowed to do morethan at present in the way of going ahead with schemes without their being exposed to meticulous financial examination.     What the Ministrywanted was more liberty, especially as regards engaging personnel and salary.He was certain that if progress rX war speed vas desired cendi-tions resembling those which obtained .in the Ministry of Munitionswould have to be introduced, and subject to general Treasury Control;the officer in charge of Training be made responsible for his ownfInanee*The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was quite ready tomeet the Ministry of Labour on the point of engaging personnels    If,for example, they desired to engage a number of temporary men withina specified range of salaries and the Treasury agreed to the number required,  the Ministry of Labour could then appoint the men withoutreferring each individual case for approval.    If the Ministry ofLabour would bring to the Treasury a schedule of the number of menthey required to engage and their salaries, he was willing to agreethat the Ministry should fill up the posts&apos;.   The Treasury had repeatedagreed to this procedure in the case of temporary appointments.(2)      Sir Robert Home said that the two bodies which the PrimeMinister was going to meet that afternoon, complained that the allow-&apos;ances of men undergoing training were not sufficient.    The allowances:were as follows:-A single man away fromA single man receivedA married man withouthome receivedfamily received40/-50/-45/-a week11ti
In addition 5/- a week efficiency bonus was paid on completionof training.    To increase these rates would mean putting up pen-sions for maximum disablement and this would lead to a great in-crease in cost.It was agreed that the above allowances were most generous and no increase couldbe made9(3)     Regarding the question of training men in agriculture LordLee said that the number of applications received to date was 30,000of which 5,000 had been refused,    The number of men on the land at the present moment was 4,500 and the- amount of land alreadyrequired for small holdings was 180,006 acres or 300 square miles,,This should be sufficient to settle 15 ,,000 men, and more land wasbeing acquired every day,   The difficulty was after training aman for agriculture to    provide him with a small holding.    A further difficulty was with the partially disabled men.    The work on asmall holding was very strenuous and it was very much to be doubted whether a disabled man could work sufficiently hard to make a living.    I&quot;&amp; was not, however, the acquisition of land which was holding up the schemep but the delay in the erection of buildings *So far not a single cottage had been completed by the Office ofWorks, but the Ministry of Agriculture was convinced that if theMinistry were allowed to build cottages on their own they could erectthe number required without the addition of a single man to their technical staff.    Many places, where the Ministry of Agriculturewished to erect cottages, were far from a village and the Officeof Works found great difficulty in obtaining the necessary labour^The Ministry of Agriculture felt that with its own staff and withthe assistance of the settlers themselves and materials on the spotthey could build the cottages more quickly*    Perhaps they would notbe as elaborate as would be the case if the Office of Works under-took the work, but there would be less delay.*Sir Frank Baines said that six complete schemes for this work had been approved by the Office of Works and the work was
gnin  on as quickly as possible.    The delay o^otuxroa. ov/ingto it not being possible to get bulk labour on to jobs outin tho wilds.    When it was possible, the Office of Worksl/ endeavoured to use local contractors, but for various reasons the local contractors did not care to tender forthe work.To the suggestion that&apos;the Ministry of Agriculture   . &quot;-should build their own cottages, it .was objected that theOffice of Works was tho Building Department of the Govern-ment and  that it was undesirable -to set up another, and-  contrary to previous Cabinet decisions...Tho Prime Minister said that as only a few hundredcotta^os were affected in this case and as no additional staff.would be required the principle might be waived,especially as tho Ministry of Agriculture said&apos;they could.-. erect cotteges in a short time..   It was decided &apos;   *  ..That the Ministry of Agriculture should furnish the Office of Works with a schedule of tho cottages they fore pro-pared, to oroot.and como to an arrangement whereby the Ministry would he responsiblefor their erection.DISABLED MENU)      The Conference were informed that the Postmaster- -IH THE POSTCffJIGEs General had ins truetei.all Postmasters to employ as manydisabled men as was possible..   A Committee containingrepresentatives of the Po^tmaster-General and the TradeUnions examined the matter and recommended that where a,man&apos;s capacity was below the usual standard, his wages should similarly fall:below the ordinary rates - suchrates of wages to.be agreed upon by the local Post-master and the local representative of the Trade Union.This recommendation was turned down by the Executivo ofthe Trade Union.&apos;
GSHEmAL (5)    With reference to the demand that a general amnestyshould be granted it was stated that when the War ended504 persons were undergoing penal  servitude and the total/ sentences of these persons amounted to 2173 years 102sentences had been remitted and all others reduced by1581 years.      The number of men undergoing penal servitudenow was 260.      Of this number 174 were serving sentencesfor desertion;     49 were serving sentences  for mutiny,striking,   etc;    40 were serving sentences for murder,manslaughter and burglary.    The tot -.1 number of men released from detention &quot;barracks was 1450.      An indiscriminaterelease of these prisoners could not be recommended,  buta continual review of the cases would go on.      The cases cfdesertion were bad ones in which&apos;the men had left their units for a considerable time and hidden away in the villages behind the firing line.      If soldiers were notpunished for   desertion,  it would greatly effect the dis-decipline of the present Army,WAP. (6)      On the question of war gratuities it was explainedGRATUITIES .that temporary officers received as a gratuity 4 months&apos;pay for the first year&apos;s service and   months&apos;  pay forevery subsequent year,  but it must be remembered that theofficer received no leave on demobilization and was not qualified for the out-of-work donation.As regards the men&apos;s gratuity,  the Cabinet had decided that the same principle should be adopted towards them as had been applied to the Regular Officers.    The menthought that they should be treated on the same basis asthe temporary officer.    To do so would cost nearly 100millions.
The total &quot;benefit for officers and men ondemobilization rechoned 1n terms of day s paywb s as fo 11 ows: -[( 2?- -lc0rs * Men,1st Year 124 2552nd.      &quot; 186 5293rd      &quot; 248 3864th      &quot; 510 4575th      &quot; 572 485In addition men were free to drew unemployment benefit.CLASS &quot;Z&quot;    (7)      ^ith reference to the demand that Class &quot;Z&quot; reserveRESERVE.should be abolished it wn3 pointed out that this was instituted in order to facilitate rapid demobilizationand at present it was possible to call all the men up for service.      This precaution was considered necessary,having In view the state of Europe at that time, butthe &quot;Z&quot; Reserve would cease to exist on the statutoryend of the war,      A pledge had been given in the Rouse ofCommons that all conscripts would be demobilised by the 30thApril this year.WAR GRAVES. (8)      With regard to the demand of the two Associationsthat facilities should be given to relatives to visit thegraves of the fallen,  there were 500,000 in France and flanders,  which would mean that 1 million relativesmight want to visit them.      It would take some time toorganise visits as most of the graves were in devastatedareas where there were no habitations.    It was generally agreed that the present time was premature for arrangingvisits, but that it might be possible to grant facilitieslater,PRE-WAR        (9)      With regard to this question, attention was drawnPENSIONS,to the fact that the Cabinet had already decided thatPre-war Pensions could not be increased (vy.C.591, Minute3)
Attention was also drawn to the fact that if the Pro-warPensions of ox-sailors and soldiers were increased it woulnecessitate a similar increase to the police, teachers   and ex-servants of the State, generally.The Chancellor of the Exchequer was requested toascertain what the cost of increasing such pensionsw o u 1 d am o u n t to.Whitehall Gardens,  3.6th February, 1920.

l&apos;y KSTl&amp;t&amp;TEB (1)    The Committee had before them a summary of Army[20-21.Estimates, 1920-21 (C*S?o-595), together with a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for War (C.P.-586).    these estimates amounted to a gross total-ofhj^lS^OCHD^OOO-r-&quot;made up as follows:-(a) The normal peace-time Army, for which amaximum of  62,000,000 had been settled by the Cabinet, but which would, only re-quire  55,500,000 in 19 20-21, owing tothe use of surplus stocks of stores andclothings(b) Terminal axpensos of the War (transport charges, separation allowances, reinstate-ment of property,, medals, war graves, etc.)for which  30,500,000 would be required:(e) Abnormal expenditure arising out of temporary obligations (e.g. the Rhine,Constantinople) or new responsibilities(edgsPalestine, Mesopotamia, Persia) forwhich  489000s000 was assigned.It was explained that the provision for the normal peace-time Army was based on the pre-war establishment,which, of course9 at present prices would cost roughlydouble what it did before the War.    Some question was raised as to whether this was the correct basis to adopthaving regard to the alteration      oircumstanc es.    Bo re-duction, however^ appeared practicable owing to the dis-appearance of Germany as a military Pswar, in view of thefact that the pre-war Army., though organised&apos; to meet anemergency on the Continent, had been designed, so far as its strength was concerned, solely with a view to thodefence of the Empire, and our liabilities in this respect,so far from being diminished, had been   increased by theacceptance of the mandates over Palestine and Mesopotamia.It was pointed out, however, that  3,750,000 towards thecost of the garrisons in these countrisa had been foundout of the provision for the normal peace-time Army.50POTAMIA. (2)    The Estimates submitted by the Secretary of Statefor War provided for the maintenance of 14,000 whits and50,000 native troops in Mesopotamia, at a coat of  18p00s000exclusive of  3,000,000 for capital expenditure on barrackaccommodation, eto. -I-\   ............
It was recognized that the cost of such a garrison foil 79Mesopotamia was prohibitive and that it must be curtailed.The suggestion was made that the Mosul Province should be evacuated, but it was pointed out that this district was therichest part of Mesopotamia and the centre of the oilfields,and that if it were abandoned the withdrawal from Mesopotamiaaltogether would have to be considered,,It was agreed that no such drastic decision could becontemplated or discussed, pending(a)    the receipt of the Survey Report whichthe Secretary of State for War had beenasked to obtain in regard to the oil resources of Mesopotamia, the preliminar-ary accounts of which were highly promising(Cabinet 8 (20), Appendix II (1)    )(b) The receipt of the Report from GeneralHaldane, the new General Officer Com-manding, who had been given special instructions to review the whole situa-tion with a view to a reduction in thestrength of the garrisons(c) the conclusion of the Treaty of Peace with turkey, on the operation of which it was recognised that the future state of orderin these territories would dependsPending the abo^e developments the Committee accepted a proposal by theSecretary of State for War that the sumof  21,500,000 proposed for the mainten-ance of the garrison in Mesopotamiashovild be halved, discretion being leftto the War Office to determine themethod by which, this reduction shouldbe secured.It was pointed out, however, that^ %n the event of anattack by the Turks or Arabs, reinforcements would be required,and that the above arrangements would then have to be re-considerede(3)     The Provisional Army Estimates included a sum of 2,750,000 for the maintenance of the force now stationed in North-West Persia, and it did not include a provision of 8,750j000 which the Indian Government was claiming inrespect of the forces in other parts of Persia.    It was agreedthat the War Office could reasonably protest against being&quot;*2&quot;*
charged Tilth this expenditure, which appeared on the face ofit excessive, and the India Office was requested to enquirehow this figure was arrived at*It was pointed out that the troops were quite inadequate to resist any serious attacks by the BolshevikseAfter a discussion with the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, the Director of Military Operations and Mr.H.A.L.Fisher and Sir William Duke, representing the IndiaOffice, the Committee agreedThat, as a corollary to the decision notto told the Caspian (Cabinet&apos; Conferenceat Paris on January 19,  1920* Conclusion 3)the following re-dispositions of troops in persia should be made:-(a)    The immediate and entire with&quot;drawal of the force of approxi-mately 1,7C0 men under GeneralMalleson at Meshed together withthe troops on their lines of communications s(b) The completion, as rapidly aspossible, of the withdrawal, whichhad already been decided on, ofthe force of approximately 10,000men in South Persia:(c) The retention for the present ofthe force at Hamadan, but thereduction of the figure of&quot; 2,750,000 proposed &quot;for theupkeep of the forces in North-&quot;West Persia to one half, discre-tion being left to&apos; the War Officeto secure  this reduction asappeared best,   he.,, either inthe form&apos;of a reduction of theforce or of thti time withinwhich tho occupation should becentinuedt(d) The Committee decided that the india Office should send a tele-gram comnunieating the above decisions to the Government ofIndia.&apos;pt and (4)    The Army&apos;Estimates included provision for the main-^frtlne.tenance of G,000 white and 23,000 native troop3 in Egypt(over and above the pre-war garrison of 6,000 white troops)at a cost of approximately  7,000,000 a year, and for a forceof 9,000 British and 26,00O native troops in Palestine, at a cost of about  7,750,000, exclusive of  1,250,000 for land andhuttingso-. o *&quot;J
It was agreed that provision 6n this  scale,   especially for the maintenance of order in Palestine, where no serious trouble could be anticipated,  was indefensible,  and theIII Committee decided ; -That,  in view of the general financial situation,the total amount included for the const of the garrisons of Egypt and Palestine,  over and abovethe cost of the normal garrison of 6;0O0 men for egypt must be reduced by one-half;The Prime Minister undertook to transmit thisdecision to Lord Milner,  and to request him togo into the whole question with Lord Allenby onthe spot,  and to report what dispositions wouldbe made to meet the new situation caused bythis decision.A oopy of the telegram is attached (Appendix).Iropriations (5)  the Secretary of state for War had proposed to deductIn Aid.from the gross estimate of  155,000,000 appropriations in aid amounting to  103,000; 000, made up as followsOrdinary appropriations in aid .......    21,000,000Extra appropriations in aid.   repres-enting (a)  charges to the Vote of credit prior to April 1,  1919.   re-payable by the Dominions............      34,000,000and(b)  Charges to the Vote of Credit andto subsequent Army Votes repayable byGermany............................       48,000,000It wao pointed out that there was considerable doubt whether extraordinary receipts to anything like the suggestedamount would be realised during the forthcoming year.    some payment would,  no doubt,  be secured from Germany,  but itwas doubtful whether the amount available for payment toGreat Britain of her share of the cost of the Army ofOccupation would be so much as  48,000,000 in 1920-21.Further,  it appeared that the Australian Government was alsobudgeting on the expectation of realising its share of re-par at ions,  and that if these Were not  received the Dominionrepayments to the exchequer might also be postponed..It was al so  explained that there were great parlia-mentary objections to taking extra-ordinary receipts asappropriations in aid of ordinary Votes, instead of passingthem into the Exchequer,,
The committee decided :-(&apos; (a) That the Army Estimates should onlyinclude ordinary receipts as appro-appropriations in aid.(h) That extraordinary receipts shouldhe paid into the Exchequer, hut thata clear note in regard to these .extraordinary receipts should be putinto the Army Estimates.Wh i t eh ai 1 &amp; a rd en s,  s .

C./J / .-:^M - H/;l    I 1/G-266.CABINS1&quot;.COMMITTEE ON NAVAL, MILITARY, AND AIR FORCE PAY.Fifth. (Supplementary) Report.(Previous Papers G.-252, G.-252 a, G.-254, G.-259, G.-259 a, G.-260.)The Pay of Chaplains.1. Army Chaplains.1. THE Committee reassembled on Friday, the 6th February, 1920, in order toconsider the future rates of pay for Chaplains in the Army.2. It will be recalled that the War Office in July last proposed a scale of pay forthese officers commencing at ll. a day on entry, and rising by quinquennial incrementsof 5s. a day to a maximum of 21. 10s. a day, reached after thirty years&apos; service this scale being analogous to that approved for Chaplains in the Royal Navy and Royal AirForce, in whose case triennial increments of 3s. a day were granted between the sameminimum and maximum rates.At that time, however, the Army Council had not reached a final decision regarding the post-war organisation of the Royal Army Chaplains Department, and a,scheme was under consideration for organising the Department in classes or grades, to each of which would he assigned a fixed establishment, promotion from any one gradeto the next higher to be by selection. This scheme was to replace the old system underwhich promotion was based upon length of service. In the view of the Army council a system of payment with increments based on length of service was entirely contraryto the essential features of the proposed scheme of reorganisation ; and the original proposals as regards pay were accordingly withdrawn.At the same time, in order not to delay the work of the Committee in settling therates of pay generally for the Army, approval was given for the assignment to theDepartment of the amount of money involved in the original proposals, the details ofthe rates to he settled by the Army Council in consultation with the Treasury.* Thiswas subsequently approved by the War Cabinet on the 15th August, 1919 (WarCabinet (516, Minute 1).3. A new scale of pay has been drawn up with the same minimum and maximumrates of 11. a day and 21. 10s. a day respectively, which is estimated to cost the same asthe original proposals ; but under the new scale increments are based on gradinginstead of upon length of service, so that it conforms with the new scheme of organisa-tion for the Royal Army Chaplains Department already referred to, which the ArmyCouncil have now adopted.f2294]
6. In face of the above arguments the Committee are unable, after c areful^ nsideration, to accept the proposal to pay Army Chaplains at the same rates asregimental officers of corresponding rank, and they therefore recommend the ratesshown in section 3 above, viz. : Proposed Pay of Army Chaplains.Per diem.   s.   d.4th Class (on probation) ... ... ... ...       10   04th Class (on being accepted for permanent commission,after  not  less  than  three  years&apos; probationaryservice)     ... ... ... ... ...       1363rd Class ... ... ... ... ...       1 10   02nd Class ... ... ... ... ...       2001st Class ... ... ... ... ...       2 10   0ii. Chaplains in the Royal Navy.The attention of the Committee has been drawn to the fact that, when the ratesof pay for Chaplains, Royal Navy, were under consideration in June last, proposals were on foot at the same time for reducing the age of retirement of these officers. As a consequence of the rates of pay which were approved, a Chaplain will only attain hismaximum after 30 years&apos; service, which he may be expected to reach at the age ofabout 55 years; but, consequent upon the new regulations governing retirement,Chaplains in the future will not remain in the service after this age, so that a Chaplaincan never obtain his maximum rate of pay of 21. 10s. a day.The Committee accordingly recommend that any Chaplain who is retained for service in the Royal Navy after the age of 50 years shall automatically receive themaximum rate of 21. 10s. a day.H.

I &apos;  187-S__C.J5_.S_T,MINUTES of a Conference held at 10,  Doming Street,) I. at 12 Boon,  on 6th February,  1920, regarding demands&apos; &apos; to be made by Deputations of the National Federationof Discharged and demobilised! Sailors and Soldiers,the Comrades of the Great V/ar and the national association which the Prime Minister was receivingthat afternoon.-----------------The Conference had before it a summary of the questions to be raised by the Deputation from the Federation.fitlBG      fl)    It was explained that the Federation of Discharged andDemobilised Soldiers and Sailors and the Comrades of theGreat Jar were very jealous of each other.    The former Bodyprofessed  to have one million members but it was believed thatin reality they had nothing like that number.    The Comradesof the Great War Association had between 500,000 and 600,000and this was the more moderate Body of the two.    although these Deputations would raise a. number  of points that aft or no onthe question in which they were interested most was that ofthe training.    These Bodies complained that there were not enough facilities for training disabled men and thoughtthat all the national factories should have been used fortraining purposes.      At the present moment, under the Ministryof Labour Scheme,  2? - 000 men had been trained, (including broken-time apprentices,  42,000) 20,000 were awaiting training,   and17,000 were in training at the present moment.The Ministry of Labour was endeavouring to obtain further Factories for those awaiting training but thistook time as before a building could be used for training purposes various Departments had to be approached andtheir consent obtained.The Treasury had to be approached regarding Finance,the Office of Works regarding the acquisition of the
Pa etc-ri.es and the Disposal Board for plans,   it t^oksome time before a national Factory could be equipped for train in :; purposes.    It was suggested that what waswanted was a hi3 organiser who could give his servicesana work in conjunction with the Minister of Labour..    xhisman should take over the whole question of training the disabled soldiers and have money placed at his disposalon a war ame.rg.ency, basis.    When the first ^rant wasexhausted he should be allowed to core to the Treasuryf-*r a further grant.    - 6, COO, 000 had been allotted inthis way to the Board of Education for the training ofwasofficers and  ft/thought something similar should bedone for the men.private  employers had been approached and wore,  infact,   training a number of men,  but the objection tothis plan waa that in many cases the men got no training at all as the employer put them to worn on cheap repetitive-ticn processes.    Where, however,   the Ministry ofLabour could  ensure that a man would get proper supervisionprivate employers baa been used..Figures were then given regarding the number of officers who had received a course of training.-;. either in Agriculturevr at the Universities or other training institutions,  andit appeared that 41,000 officers had so far been trained.Comment was mo.de on the fact that the figure of men trainedcompared very unfavourably with that of the officers.Mr. currie of the Ministry of Labour was then askedto make suggestions for speeding up the machinery fort rainin3 di sab1ed men,Mr. Currie said there were two great difficulties -(l)  the. delays in obtaining factories and adapting thenfor training purposes and (2)  the difficulty in obtainingpermission of the skilled men in trade unions for the admission into tho trade of disabled men when trained.For e xa mp 1 e,  the /
Ministry of Labour had agreed upon a scheme with the executive, ofthe AcS.E. regarding the admission of Disabled Men into the Engineer-/dng tradef but this scheme had been rejected by a ballot of the men.It was essential to get the skilled men to modify their attitude inthis respect *As regards the money required for these schemes, he had nothing to complain of in the gross total which the Treasury had sanctioned,but he thought that the Ministry o.f Labour might be allowed to do morethan at present in the way of going ahead with schemes without their being exposed to meticulous financial examination.     What the Ministrywanted was more liberty, especially as regards engaging personnel and salary *He was certain that if progress at war speed was desired condi-tions resembling those which obtained In the Ministry of Munitionswould have to be introduced, and subject to general Treasury Control,the officer in charge, of Training be made responsible for his ownfinance *The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was quite ready tomeet the Ministry of Labour on the point of engaging personnel.    If,for example, they desired to engage a number of temporary men withina specified range of salaries and the Treasury agreed to the number required, the Ministry of Labour could then appoint the men withoutreferring each individual case for approvals    If the Ministry ofLabour would bring to the Treasury a schedule of the number of menthey required to engage and their salaries., he was willing to agreethat the Ministry should fill up the postsa    The Treasury had repeatedagreed to this procedure in the cage of temporary appointments *(2)     Sir Robert Home said that the. two bodies v/hich the PrimeMinister was going to meet that afternoon,, complained that the allow-ances of men undergoing training were not sufficient.    The allowances were as follows a single man received       40/- a week a married man without a family received SO,/-?      *A single man away from home received 45/-
crease in cost.It was agreed that the above allowances were most generous and no Increase couldbe made8(3)      Regarding the question of training men In agriculture LordNEDLee said that the number of applications received to date was 30,000of which 5,000 had been refused.    The number of men on the land at the present moment was 4,500 and the amount of land alreadyrequired for small holdings was 180,006 acres or 300 square miles,This should be sufficient to  settle 15,000 men, and more land wasbeing aco/uired every day,    The difficulty was after training aman for agriculture to    provide him with a small holding   A further difficulty was with the partially disabled men.

The number of men on the landE *at the present moment was 4,500 and the amount of land already;      required for small holdings was 180,006 acres or 300 square miles.This should be sufficient to settle 15,000 men, and more land wasbeing acquired every day.    The difficulty was after training aman for agriculture to    provide him with a small holding *    A further difficulty was with the partially disabled men.

The a ox ay o^ooixrod .ovrinp.to it.not.being possible to get bulk labour on to jobs outQy- . in the wilds,    When it was possible,  ths Office of Worksendeavoured to use local contractors, but for various reasons the local contractors did not care to tender forthe- works to the. suggestion that the Ministry of agriculture ahould build their own cottages, it was objected that theOffice of Works was the Building Department of the Sovern-mant and  that it was undesirable to set up another, andcontrary to previous Cabinet decisions..Tho Prime ,Minister said that as only a few hundredcottages were affected In this case and as no additional staff would be required the principle might be waived.,especially as the Ministry of Agriculture said&apos;they coulderect cottages in a short time..It was decided --That the Ministry of Agriculture should furnish the Office of Works with a schedule of tho cottages they wore pro-pared to erect and como to an arrangement whereby the Ministry would be responsiblefor their erection.SABLED MBJST(4)      The Conference were informed that the Postmastor-THE POSTOFFICE. General had instructed all postmasters to employ as manydisabled men as was possible..   A Committee containingrepresentatives of the Po&apos;o  master-General and the TradeUnions examined the matter and recommended that where aman&apos;s capacity was below the usual standard, his wages should similarly fall below the ordinary rates - suchrates of wages to be agreed upon by the local Post-master and the local representative of the Trade Union.This recommendation was turned down by the Executive ofthe Trade Union.
GENERAL (5)    With reference to the demand that a general amnestyAHKBSTY.should he granted it was stated that when the War endedf 504 persons were undergoing penal servitude and the totalsentences of these persons amounted to 21*7 3 years 102sentences had been remitted and all others reduced by1581 years.      The number of men undergoing penal servitudeqow was 260.      Of this number 174 were serving sentencesfor desertion;    49 were serving sentences for mutiny,striking,   etc;    40 were serving sentences for murder,manslaughter and burglary.    The total number of men released from detention barracks was 1450.      An indiscriminaterelease of these prisoners could not be recommended, buta continual review of the cae.es would go on.      The cases ofdesertion were bad ones in which the men had left their units for a considerable time and hidden away in the.villages behind the firing line.      If soldiers were notpunished for   desertion,  it would greatly effect the dis-ciplins of the present Army.WAR (6)      On the question of war gratuities it was explainedGRATUITIES.that temporary officers received as a gratuity 4 months&apos;pay for the first year&apos;a service and 2 months&apos;  pay forevery subsequent year,  but it must be remembered that theofficer received no leave on demobilization and was not qualified for the out-of-work donation.As regards the men&apos;s gratuity,  the Cabinet had decided that the same principle should be adopted towards them as had been applied to the Regular Officers.    The menthought that they should be treated on the same basis asthe temporary officer.    To do so would cost nearly 100millions!.
The total &quot;benefit for officers and men ondemobilization reckoned in terms of days paywas as foilons: -OfficersMen,1st Year1341862483103722553293864374852nd3rd4 th5 thIn addition men were free to draw unemployment benefit.CLASS &quot;Z&quot;    (7)      flith reference to the demand that Class &quot;Z&quot; reserves should be abolished it was pointed out that this wesinstituted in order to facilitate rapid demobilizationand at present it was possible to call all the men up for service.      This precaution was considered necessary,having in view the state of Europe at that time, butthe &quot;z&quot; Reserve would cease to exist on the statutoryend of the war.      A pledge had been given in the House ofCommons that all conscripts would be demobiliaed by the 30thApril this year.EAR GRAVES. (8)      with regard, to the demand of the two Associationsthat facilities should ba given to relatives to visit thegraves of the fallen,  there were 500,000 in France and flanders,  which would mean that 1 million relativesmight -want to visit them.      It would take some time toorganise visits as most of the graves were in devastatedareas where there were no habitations.    It was generally agreed that the present time was premature for arrangingvisits,  but that it might be possible to grant facilitieslater.to the fact that the Cabinet had already decided thatPre-war Pensions could not be Increased (W.C.591, Minute3)RESERVE.[RE-WARPENSIONS,(9)With regard to this question, attention was drawn
Attention was also drawn to the fact that if the Pro-warPensions of ex-sailers and soldiers wore increased it would necessitate a similar increase to  the police, teachers   and ex-servants of the Stato, generally.Tho Chancellor of tho Exchequer was requested toascertain what the cost of increasing such pensionsw o u1d amoun t to.2 Whitehall Gardens,  S.V7.1.6th February, 1920.

(2) With reference to Cabinet 9 (20), Conclusions 1 snd2, as matters of urgency, in. view of the forthcoming Inter-Allied Conference in London, the questions 6f war criminalsand of the Zaiser were very briefly discussed at the end ofthe meeting. On the former question the following alterna-tive proposals were considered:-(a) An Inter-Allied Tribunal, as at presentsuggested;(h) A Court, composed exclusively of GermanJudges, to be held at Leipzig or     moGerman town:(ci) An International Court, to includeGerman Judges, with a Chairman ap-pointed by a neutral country,  to sit in Germany:&apos;d) An International Court, to includeGerman Judges, with a neutral Chairman,to sit in the occupied areas of Germany:(e) The French proposal that,  if the Germansrefused to hand over the accused pa rsty.&apos;-named in the  several Allied lists,   thelatter should be tried in absentia.While no decision was taken, in view of the absenceof the Lord. Chancellor,  the Conference were unanimouslyopposed to the French proposal (e ),  and in respect of theother suggestions the general trend of the discussion was infavour of alternative  (d),  viz.,  that an International flmjytto include German Judges, with a neutral Chairman, sh ouldsit in the occupied areas of Germany.The Conference agreedThat the Secretary of State for PotsignAffairs,  In consultation with the LordChancellor,  the British Ambassador inParis, and the .Attorney-Gens ral,  should. .prepare, for the consideration of theCabinetThe Liquor Control Bill:Reform of the House of Lords:The Coal Mines Bill.(a) The Leader of the House of Lords was.authorised to state,  should the questionbe raised,  that it was the inten-ticn of the Government, as announced in the King T.s Speech, to submit pro-poSeals for the Reform of tho Houseof Lords, but that it was premature to say more as to the nature of theseproposals than that the recornrnenda-tions of the Bryce Committee would be carefully considered.
 (i) An alternative proposal in regard to the persons accused of breaches of the laws of war:

 (ii) An alternative to the French draft reply to the Netherlands Government in respect of the Kaiser.

TREATY OF PEACE WITH TURKEY.

 (3) With reference to Cabinet 8 (20). Conclusion 8. the British Ambassador in Paris reported that it was M. Millerand intention not to remain in London after the end of the week. He himself had not felt justified in warning M. Millerand of the necessity which might be imposed upon the British Government of making separate arrangements with Turkey, since this appeared to him to constitute a breach at the Pact of London, by which Great Britain, France, Italy and Russia bound themselves, inter alia, not to put forward peace conditions without previous agreement with each of the other Allies.

 In view of the great and growing urgency of obtaining a settlement of the Turkish question --

 The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was authorised at once to warn the French Ambassador in London of the necessity which might be forced upon the British Government (if the French Government would not agree to press on with the Turkish Treaty) of making their own arrangements for peace with Turkey.

 It was generally felt that,  should the British Government feel impelled reluctantly to take this line, Italy would almost certainly follow suit.

BRITISH POLICY RUSSIA. 

 (4) With reference to Cabinet 7 (20), Conclusion 1, before the Conference broke up there was a short discussion on British policy in Russia.

iY ESTIMATESgQ-21.SOPOTAMIA,(1)    The Committee had before them a summary of AxnryAEstimates, 1920-21 (C.&amp;.-585). together with a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for War (C .P*-586).    these estimates amounted to a gross&apos; total-.o.f--a!JU34-^CKK),XXXV&apos;&quot;made up as follows:-(a) The normal peace-time Army, for which amaximum of  62,000,000 had been settled by the Cabinet, but which would only re-quire  55,500,000 in 1920-21, owing tothe use of surplus stocks of stores and clothing;(b) Terminal expenses of the War (transport charges, separation allowances, reihstate-ment of property, medals, war graves, etc.)for which  30,500,000 would be required:fc) Abnormal expenditure arising out of temporary obligations (e.g. the Rhine,Constantinople) or new responsibilities(e.g*Palestine, Mesopotamia, Persia) forwhich  48,000e0O0 was assigned.It was explained that the provision for the normal peace-time Army was based on&quot;the pre-war establishment,which, of course, at present prices would cost roughlydouble what it did before the War.    Some question was raised as to whether this was the correct basis -to adopthaving regard to the alteration i.n. circumstances,    No re-duction, however, appeared practicable owing to the &amp;is-appearance of Germany as a military Power, in view of thefact that.the pre-war Army, though organised to meet anemergency on the Continent, had been designed, so far as its strength was concerned, solely with a view to thedefence of the Empire, and our liabilities in this respect,so far from being diminished, had been   increased by theacceptance of the mandates over Palestine and Mesopotamia.It was pointed out, however, that  3,750,000 towards thecost of the garrisons in these countries had been foundout of the provision for the normal peace-time Army.(2)    The Estimates submitted by the Secretary of Statefor War provided for the maintenance of 14,000 whits and50,000 native troops in Mesopotamia, at a cost of  18^00,000exclusive of  3,000,000 for capital expenditure on barrackaccommodation, etc -X-
It was recognized that the cost of such a garrison for mesopotamia was prohibitive and that it must be curtailed.The suggestion was made that the Mosul Province should be evacuated, but it was pointed out that this district was therichest part of ^sopotamia and the centre of the oilfields,and that if it were abandoned the withdrawal from Mesopotamiaaltogether would have to be considered,It was agreed that no such drastic decision could becontemplated or discussed, pending(a)    the receipt of the Survey Report whichthe Secretary of State for War had beenasked to obtain In regard to the oil resources of Mesopotamia, the preliminar-ary accounts of which were highly promising(Cabinet 8 (20), Appendix II (1)    )    :(b) The receipt of the Report from GeneralHaldane^ the new General Officer Com-mandingj who had been given special instructions to review the whole situa-tion with a view to a reductioh in thestrength of the garrison:(c) the conclusion of the Treaty of Peace with turkey, on .the operation of which It was recognised that the future state of orderin these territories would Ftepdnd.Pending the abo^e developments the Committee accepted a proposal by theSecretary of State for War that the sumof  21,500,000 proposed for the mainten-ance of the garrison in Mesopotamiashould be halved, discretion being leftto the War Office to determine themethod by which this reduction shouldbe secured,.It was pointed out, howeyef, that, %n the event of anattack by the Turks or Arabs, reinforcements would be required,and that the above arrangements would then have to be re-considerede(3)     The Provisional Army Estimates included a sum of ,2,750,000 for the maintenance of the force now stationed in North-West Persia, and it did not include a provision of 8,750,000 which the Indian Government was claiming inrespect of the forces in other parts of Persia.    It was agreedthat the War Office could reasonably protest against being
charged with this expenditure, which appeared on the face ofit excessive, and the India Office was requested to enquirehow this figure was arrived at*It was pointed out that the troops were quite inadequate to resist an;/ serious attacks by the BolshevikssAfter a discussion with the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, the Director of Military Operations and Mr.H.A.L.Fisher and Sir William Duke, representing the IndiaOffice, the Committee agreed   --.That, as a corollary to the decision notto hold the Caspian (Cabinet Conferenceat Paris on January 19,.1920,.Conclusion 3)the following re-dispositions of troops in persia should be made:--(a)    The immediate and entire with-drawal of the force of approxi-mately 1,700 men under GeneralMalleson at Meshed together withthe troops on their lines ofcommunicationso(b) The completion, as rapidly aspossible,.of the withdrawal,. whichbad already been decided on, ofthe force of approximately 10,000men in South Persia;(c) The retention for the present ofthe force at Hamadan, but thereduction of the figure of 2,750,000 proposed for theupkeep of the forces in North-West Persia to one half, discre-tion being left to the War Officeto secure this reduction asappeared best,, he.., either inthe form of a reduction of theforce or of the time withinwhich tho occupation should becontinued:(d) The Committee decided that the india Office should send a tele-gram communicating the above decisions to the rrovernment ofIndia.lypt and (4)    The Army&apos;Estimates included provision for the main-IWtine.tenance of G,000 white and 23,000 native troops in Egypt(over and above the pre-war garrison of 6,000 white troops)at a cost of approximately  7,000,000 a year, and for a forceof 9,000 British and 26,000 native troops in Palestine, at a cost of about  7,750,000, exclusive of  1,250,000 for land andhuttingt
It was agreed that provision on this scale,   especially for the maintenance of order in Palestine, where no serious trouble could be anticipated,  was indefensible,  and theCommittee decided :-That,  in view of the general financial situation,the total amount included for the coat of the garrisons of Kgypt and Palestine,  over and abovethe cost of the normal garrison of 6,000 men for egypt must be reduced by one-half;The Prime Minister undertook to transmit thisdecision to lord Miiner.  and to request him togo into the whole question with Lord Allenby onthe spot,  and to report what dispositions wouldbe made to meet the new situation caused bythis decision.A copy of the telegram is attached (Appendix).propriatione (5) the Secretary of State for War had proposed to deductin Aid.from the gross estimate of  155,000,000 appropriations in aid amounting to  103,COO,000, made up as followsOrdinary appropriations in aid .......     21,000,000Extra appropriations in aid.  repres-enting (a)  charges to the Vote of credit prior to April 1,  1919,  re-payable by the Dominions  ............       34,000,000and(b)  Charges to the Vote of Credit andto subsequent Army Votes repayable byGermany  ................,...........       48, 000, 000It was pointed out that there was considerable doubt whether extraordinary receipts to anything like the suggestedamount would be realised during the forthcoming year.    some payment would,  no doubt, be secured from Germany,  but itwas doubtful whether the amount available for payment toGreat Britain of her share of the cost of the Army ofOccupation would be so much as  48,000^000 in 1920-21,Further,  it appeared that the Australian Government was alsobudgeting on the expectation of realising its share of re-reparations,  and that if these v;ere not  received the Dominionrepayments to the Exchequer might also be postponed.It was also  explained that there were great parlia-mentary objections to taking extraordinary receipts asappropriations in aid of ordinary Votes, instead of passingthem into the Exchequer.
I, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W. 1.9 th F eh ru ary,  19 20 -The Committee decided(a) That the Army Estimates 3hould onlyinclude ordinary receipts as appro-appropriations in aid.(h)  That extraordinary receipts should&quot;be paid into the Exchequer, hut thata clear note in regard to theseextraordinary receipts should be putinto the Army estimates.

(Supplementary) Report.(Previous Papers G.-252, G-252 a, G.-254, G.-259, G.-259 a, G.-260.)The Pay of Chaplains.1. Army Chaplains.1. THE Committee reassembled on Friday, the 6th February, 1920, in order toconsider the future rates of pay for Chaplains in the Army.2. It will be recalled that the War Office in July last proposed a scale of pay forthese officers commencing at 11. a day on entry, and rising by quinquennial incrementsof 5s. a day to a maximum of 21. 10s. a day, reached after thirty years&apos; service this scale being analogous to that approved for Chaplains in the Royal Navy and Royal AirForce, in whose case triennial increments of 3s. a day were granted between the sameminimum and maximum rates.At that time, however, the Army Council had not reached a final decision regarding the post-war organisation of the Royal Army Chaplains Department, and ascheme was under consideration for organising the Department in classes or grades, to each of which would be assigned a fixed establishment, promotion from any one gradeto the next higher to be by selection. This scheme was to replace the old system underwhich promotion was based upon length of service. In the view of the Army council a system of payment with increments based on length of service was entirely contraryto the essential features of the proposed scheme of reorganisation ; and the original proposals as regards pay were accordingly withdrawn.At the same time, in order not to delay the work of the Committee in settling therates of pay generally for the Army, approval was given for the assignment to theDepartment of the amount of money involved in the original proposals, the details ofthe rates to be settled by the Army Council in consultation with the Treasury.^ Thiswas subsequently approved by the War Cabinet on the 15th August, 1919 (WarCabinet (516, Minute 1).3. A new scale of pay has been drawn up with the same minimum and maximumrates of 11. a day and 21. 10s. a day respectively, which is estimated to cost the same asthe original proposals; but under the new scale increments are based on gradinginstead of upon length of service, so that it conforms with the new scheme of organisa-tion for the Royal Army Chaplains Department already referred to, which the ArmyCouncil have now adopted.* Third Report of the Committee, g. 259, page 4, recommendation 2.[2294]
2Q&apos;Q6. In face of the above arguments the Committee are unable, after c arefulconsideration, to accept the proposal to pay Army Chaplains at the same rates asregimental officers of corresponding rank, and they therefore recommend the ratesshown in section 3 above, viz. : Proposed Pay of Army Chaplains.Per diem.   s.  d.4th Class (on probation) ... ... ... ...       10   04th Class (on being accepted for permanent commission,after  not   less   than   three   years&apos;  probationaryservice)     ... ... ... ... ...       1363rd Class ... ... ... ... ...       1 10   02nd Class ... ... ... ... ...       2   0   01st Class ... ... ... ... ...       2 10   0ii. Chaplains in the Royal Navy.The attention of the Committee has been drawn to the fact that, when the ratesof pay for Chaplains, Royal Navy, were under consideration in June last, proposals were on foot at the same time for reducing the age of retirement of these officers. As a consequence of the rates of pay which were approved, a Chaplain will only attain hismaximum after 30 years&apos; service, which he may be expected to reach at the age ofabout 55 years ; but, consequent upon the new regulations governing retirement,Chaplains in the future will not remain in the service after this age, so that a Chaplaincan never obtain his maximum rate of pay of 21. 10s. a day.The Committee accordingly recommend that any Chaplain who is retained for service in the Royal Navy after the age of 50 years shall automatically receive themaximum rate of 21. 10s. a day.H.
