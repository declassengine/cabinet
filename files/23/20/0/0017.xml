n FIR OrORC&apos;?I G .the elrsupply&apos;-q-vu      (i) Pith refe-eno&amp;-t^-Oabinet 13 (20),  Conclusions, theCabinet had before then the &apos; following, documents on the subjectof Empire Cott on-G-rowing : -A Memorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade  (Paper CP.-497),A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affaire (Paper CP.-642),A Memorandum by the President of theBoa^d of Trade (Paper C.P.-8S9),A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (Paper CP,-894),A Memorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade (CP.-944).The Cabinet were informed that the Cotton Manufacturershad certain proposals which they wished to discuss privately,in the first instance, with members of the Government.The question was postponed until theabove proposals had been considered.iCTRICITY   (2) With reference to Cabinet 10 (19), Appendix II (5),bill.the Cabinet had before them the following documents in regardto the Fleetricity Supply Bill:-A Memorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary,Ministry of Transport  (Paper C.P.-754),A Memorandum by the Ministry of Transport,covering Draft Bill (Paper CP.-802),A Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (Paper C.P.-814).It was explained that, when the Electricity SupplyPill was before the House of Lords at the end of the last session of Parliament-   a portion of the Bill was&apos;withdrawn,but on the distinct understanding that it would be reintro-duced.    When the Lords&apos; amendments were considered in the commons, the Home Secretary and the Minister of transport had given a pledge that,if the House would accept the Sillin its emasculated form, the portion   excised by the lords would be reint&quot;produced during this Session.    The omittedportion dealt chiefly with the powers of the ElectricityCommissioners to make advances to District Boards up to an aggregate sum of  25,000,000,uoon conditions to be approved
by the Treasury.    It was proposed that the ElectricityCommissionersshould, raise the funds for the purpose bythe issue of Electricity Stock, the interest upon Whichwas to be guaranteed by the Treasury..    These powers were included in the new Bill (Paper CP,-802) -to amend the Flec-tricity (Supply) Act, 1919, which it was proposed to submit for passage through Parliament pro forma.Against this procedure, however, it was urged thatthe country&apos;s financial condition made it most undesirablefurther to pledge the Government&apos;s credit.    Since the passingof the Elect-icity (Supply) Act,  in 1919, it had become clearthat the resources of the Government would be taxed to theuttermost to find the money required for its Housing Policy.The possible advance of  25,000., 000 for Electricity wouldaccentuate the Government&apos;s difficulties, and in these circum-stanoes Parliament should be asked to absolve Ministers fromthe oledpee riven.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Amending Bill should be re-int&quot;produced:(b) That there should be an honourableunderstanding,  so far as the present financial year is concerned,  that noadvances should be made by the Elec-t ricitv Commissioners without theauthority of the  Chancellor of theFx chequer(3) The Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumdealing with the Civil Service Cost-of-Living Bonus.After same discussion,  the Cabinet agreed (a) To approve the proposal of the Treasury thatthe Official side of the &quot;Thitley Council beauthorised to come to an agreement with theStaff side on the lines of Scheme C. as mod-ified by certain suggestions of the Postmaster-General,  a condition&apos;of the agreement being that there should be a sliding scale arrange-ment unde-* which the amount of bonus shouldrise or fall in accordance with fluctuations in the cost of living.:(b) That the Whitley Council should only deal,as regards grading, salary and bonus, withsalaries of  500 per annum and below:
, (c) That, as a first step in establishingscales of salaries above  500 per annum,the Chancellor of the Exchequer, shouldinviteMr Asquith,.Sir Joseph Maclay,Lord Colwyn,to meet and advise him ag to the propersalary of - a Permanent Under-Sec ret- arvof State.jhe Post Office The Cabinet agreed -in relntlon tothe Soi.us-. (i) That,  as a matter of principle the PostOffice must pay its way, due regard beinghad to the services rendered by it to allother Government Departments:(ii) -That,, in connection with certain demandsby the Post Office staff for an increasein basic wages, .the Secretary of the PostOffice should be authorised to offer an advance estimated to cost about  1,250,000per annum, on the understanding that, thiswas the farthest point to which the Govern-ment we &quot;Q prepared to go at present:.(lit) That, in order t-o enable these additions to wages to he. made out of the revenue of the Post Office, the Chancellor of theExchequer should be authorised to announce in his Budget Statement-certain changes proposed in the charges for postal facili-ties, which were indicated by the Chancel-lor of the Exchequer.    (It was understoodthat the enforcement of some, of these would depend upon international agreement.)(4) The Cabinet, had before them a Memorandum by the FirstLord of the Admiralty stating that there were indications that, as soon as the ice conditions permitted, the ships of the-Bolshevist Fleet might attack Finnish and Latvian,ports,.   The Admiralty asked for the instructions of theCabinet-in this eventuality (Paper CP.-956).   Their presentorders - were not to permit  Soviet vessels to make any externaaggression on ^sthonian or Latvian or Finnish ports,, and toassume that- Bolshevist mori-ofrwa-r encountered at sea were hostile.   At- the same time, trading with Russian ports was allowed, but ships suspected of carrying arms or ammunitionwere detained and sent to Danzig to be searched.    Should the,Bolshevist Fleet come out and attack, we should require *Iconsiderably larger -for\ee&apos; to oppose it successfully than had at- present in the  alt-ic, where we had only one has,.    /J&quot;is-heyist1&quot;aval ao-ti-?rri.p.s iu;i BALTIC,
which^-we^houldL. go^rnrp^^&apos;^ &quot;Finnsand the - Bolsheviks .0onsiderable-doubt was thrown\rpon the-probability of a sea attack by the Bolshevist Fleet,  especially in viewof the impending visit of the trading delegates to thiscountry.The Cabinet decided -(a)  That the Admiralty should give instruc-tions that the British Fleet should not take action against the Bolshevist Fleetwithout the Cabinet being consulted inadvance by the Admiralty:(h) That the Secretary of State for foreign       Affairs should examine the Baltic situa-I      tion, with special reference to the pro-I      bable behaviour of the Bolshevist Fleet,,and report to the Cabinet.OTH RUSSIA.        (5) The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the FirstIshevist       lord of the Admiralty,   covering two telegrams which had beentivit iesPersia.        received from the Commander-in-Chief in the MediterraneanI   regarding the present position in South Russia (Paper C.F.-jj    933) and asking for instructions upon the policy to be pursuedI    by the Navy towards General Denikin.It was explained that thousands of Russian refugeeshad been evacuated from the mainland and scattered among the island&quot; of the Aegean, while General Denikin himself,  andsome 10,000 troops, had escaped to the Crimea.    Bis fate therewould largely depend on the attitude of the natives and onthe quantity of stores which he had been able to take withhim.A draft telegram, which it was proposed to send toGeneral Keyes, was read to the Cabinet,  in which our repre-sentative was instructed to invite General Denikin to give up the struggle;    to urge upon him that Russian&quot;interests would best be served by making Peace at once;    and to offer&apos;our services as intermediaries with the Soviet Government,with whom we would endeavour to arrange an amnesty and te-vs   ;of capitulation.    Further, it was suggested in the telegram
that General Denikin and his--chief sup-oort ers should be offered the hospitality of this country.It was pointed out that,  in the negotiations with the bolshevist Government, use could be made of an offer to re-open trade with Odessa.^he Cabinet decided  (a) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should despatch a telegram tothe Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean,on the lines of the draft telegram summarised above;(b) That the Admiralty should instruct theCommander-in-Chief in the mediterranean to abstain from further belligerent actionin support of General Denikin:(c) That  the question of Bolshevist intriguesin Persia should be taken Tip by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs during the visit of the trading delegates to this country.Whitehall Gardens, S.T.1,March 31,  1920.
19th March, 1920.My dear Hankey,IX   The Chancellor has asked me to send to you for your information a copy of a very secret memorandum whichhe Is circulating from here direct to members of theCabinet.     He is not circulating it in the ordinary way owing to the very secret nature of its contents.     Hewould be much obliged if you would arrange for thepaper to be discussed at Gabi.net in about a week orten days&apos; time.Yours sincerely,LieutColonelSir M.P.A. Hankey,
I circulate herewith for Cabinet approval an import ant and. secret memorandum which has &quot;been preparedby the Treasury in regard to the Civil Service Cost ofLiving Bonus.    In view of the need for secrecy end inorder to prevent any spread of information in any quarter in advance of the decision of the Cabinet I would, askMinisters to take special steps to see that this paperdoes not leave their personal possession.
MB. BAIJDTOfCEAHCSLLOR Glf TILS EXCHEQUER.I submit     memorandum which has been prepared in the Treasury in connection with the deliberations ofa Committee appointed by the National Whitley council for the Civil Service to consider the cost of living.You will observe that on the present occasionresort has not been made by the staff to the arbitration board as has hitherto been their practice;    instead themachinery of Vdiitleyista is being tried by them,  withoutprejudice to their right of appeal to that Board.The scheme suggested by the staff side is given inthe memorandum and the objections to it explained:    analternative scheme - (c) - is put forward by the Treasury.1 desire just to touch on three matters:(l) the extent of the cost to the taxpayer depends upon the policy to be adopted in regard to thePost Office;    is that service (of common-carrierand therefore a business service) to be made-  self-supporting or to be subsidised out of theExchequer;(2) an increase in Civil Service bonus is certain to lead to further demands from purely temporaryemployees of Government:    this would be additional to the figure of cost shewn in the memorandum,  but its amount cannot be defined in anticipation ofthe particular&quot; settlement that might be reached,e.g. an &quot;all-round increase by 5s. per head wouldaccount for something between 1 end 2 millions &apos;(declining pro rata with reduction of temporary staff) .
/(3)    I earnestly deprecate discussion at awhitley Committee (which consists, as toone-half,  of the rank and file of the Service)of the remuneration of the controlling and ofthe higher grades of the Civil Service.     Iwould submit.that this is a question solelyand directly for Government.   If you agree,I would suggest that the deliberations of thisWhitley Committee should be confined to salarylimits not exceeding  500 which would includethe great mass of the staff,If it is possible,  an early decision is very desirable.(Intld.) K.P.W.F,18/3/20.I concur.(Intld.)  8.33.  19/3/20.1 concur and submit for cabinet approval.(Intld.) A.C*. 19/3/20.
civil island vice cost of li tog bonus.At a meeting of the Civil Service National .Whifley Council held on 14th October last,  a. specialCommittee was appointed Mto consider the increase inthe cost of living and its effect upon the salaries ofCivil Servants whether permanent or temporary,  and toreport to the Council.&quot;As from 17th Sovemher last permanent CivilServants became entitled to a War bonus at-the followingr at e s: -&apos; Men of wgl[jyjearjB of age and upwards.(a) if receiving pay of 60/- a week or less:-24/- a week   (^ 62.12s. a year) * 50% of pay.(b) if receiving in excess of 60/- a week:-. 60 a year * 50^&quot; of pey.iYouths i betyreen^ 18 and 21. years. tof i ag,e .1?/- a week (*--S44.7s. a year) -f 30$ of pay.Boys under is.11s.6d. a week (^30 a year) * (if over 16)30/fc of pay.Women of 18 years of age and upwards.15s. a week (or  40 a year) * 30% of pay.GirlsPresentBonus.
f) ^ 1-^Girls under 18.11s.6d. a -week (s 30 a year) * (if over 16) 30)2 of pay.The maximum rate of bonus is limited to  500a year for men,   end to  300 a year for women.In fixing these rates of bonus the CivilService Arbitration Board recognised &quot;that the expectation-&quot;tation of a sustained fall in prices that existed, at&quot;the time of the previous Award (51st March 1919) had&quot;been falsified.&quot;  The Labour Gazette for October .........&quot;shewed an increase from 115 per cent to 120 per cent&quot;in the official figure,   and &quot;there had since been a&quot;ftirther advance in the price of certain staple .foods. *&quot;The Board held that the argument was, not without force&quot;that,  in determining the extent to which different&quot;classes of Civil Servants should be called upon to&quot;share in the national burden by foregoing full oom-&quot;pensation for the decrease in the purchasing power&quot;of money,  the extent to which they were already sharing&quot;in that burden by paying increased income tax was a&quot;relevant consideration.&quot;The average percentage increase, as comparedwith July, 1914, in the general level of retail prices(including those of food, clothing, fuel and light etcascreasedst ofving.
as well as rent) at the beginning of each month from january 1919 onwards is stated by the Ministry ofLabour to be as follows :-31?J anuaryFebruaryMarchAprilMayJuneJulyAugustSeptemberOctoberNovemberDecember1920.JanuaryFebruary120usno105105105 - 110115115120125125130M.3.     These figures are based on budgets of working classs.families receiving wages up bo 62/- a week.   The detailedstatistics reveal the &quot;fact that in almost all cases inwhich the family wage was more than 50/- a week, there was more than one wage earner in the family.The
Ixie Staff Side The Staff Side holds the view that theclaim.remuneration of Civil Servants as a class should beso fixed in 1920 and onwards as to give them the samegross purchasing capacity as they enj oyed before thewar, and that the Civil Servants&apos; contribution towardspayment for the war should be got by means of direct and indirect taxation.   In support of this claim, theyquote the following statement recently made by the R.T.. Hon. R. IvlcKerma&quot;The actual spending power of the public isgauged by the total amount of currency in circulationadded to the total amount of bank deposits.   In 1914the public spending power was  1,198 millions; to-dayit is  2,693 millions, an increase of  1,495 millionsor 125 per cent..........    The spending power of thepublic and the cost of living shew the same percentage increase of 125 w.They admit that as things are at present the purchasing capacity of the country has not increased ari passu for all classes, that the profiteer on theone hand and the industrial classes on the other handhave got more than a proportionate share of the spoil.But they urge that the Government has no right to depress the remuneration of its direct employees belowa figure corresponding to the increased purchasingpower of the country as a whole; and that whilst theCivil Servant may fairly be asked to bear his due pro-portion of the cost of the war in the form of taxation,there

The.additional cost over presentwages plus bonus for the Post Office alone is estimatedat  7,500,000.    (The corresponding figure for the whole ofthethere is no justification for making him pay both inmeal and in malt.     (What the Staff Side really meanis that the Government should relieve the Civil Servantfrom subsidization of the &quot;profiteer.   When it is put to them that the hulk of the spoil has gone not to theprofiteers but to the industrial classes, they attempt,naturally enough, to burke the issue.)In pursuance of their main principle, theStaff Side submit the following concrete scheme ;-
the Civil Service, including i^ost Office, is notavailable but it would probably not be less than 12,000 ,000).(b)   Comparison with cubside practice., The proposal to give the full percentage increase on pre-war salaries up to  200 per annum ismore liberal (bo far as wages and salaries between 40s.a week and  200 per annum are concerned) than outsidepractice.   Again pre-war incomes between  200 and 550 per annum would be more than doubled and this isequally in advance of normal practice.( c)   % no ongjst en cy.The drop in the percentage increase onpre-war wages would be continuous- throughout the salary grades and the increase would amount to about41% at  1,500 and 2*1% at the  2,000 point (or to.5/w and nothing if account is taken of income tax).This is not in accordance with the avowed, objective of the Staff Side which is to restore the pre-warpurchasing power of incomes. -Comparisonwith other For the purpose of comparison statements areschemes.attached (App.A. and B) shewing.the actual increases(and the corresponding percentage increases) involvedfor typical pre-war wages and salaries by ;(a) the present Civil Service bonus: .(b) the Staff side proposal;(c) a scheme on lines similar to the staff side proposal but allowing the full percent-age increase.( 25%) up to&apos; 100 per annumonly
s.d.only (i.e. S8/4d per week), 75^ on thenext  100, and 50% on each succeeding  100.The additional cost for the Most. Office alone,of schemes (b) and (c) is estimated to be(b)   - .27 , 500,000 per annum(cj   -  5,660,000 per annum.For the whole Civil Service (including rosfcOffice) the cost would be approximately  15,000,000 and 10 ,000,000.In favour of scheme (c) it might be urged tjaat;-(i)   The proposal to grant the full percentages.d.increase on pre-war wages up to 88/4 a week is fully supported by the increases granted in the industrialworld.   The Minister of Labour, who has bean consultedis satisfied that if Civil Service pre-war wages up to40/- a week were increased by the full cost of livingpercentage increase, no awkward consequences in connectionwith industrial wages need be feared.(2)   Assuming that the fall percentage increase is granted on incomes up to  100 per annum it is riot un-reasonable to propose an increase of &apos;75y. on the next  100in the case of pre-war incomes over  100 per annum.(This represents an increase of 100/. on pre-war salaries of  200 per annum).(3)   The percentage increase accruing under thepresent Civil Service bonus drops very rapidly betweenthe  100 and the  200 points;   scheme (c) is in thisrespect
respect a very considerable improvement on the presentbonus.(4)   Under this scheme the percentage increase forpre-war salaries of SbOC and upwards drops slowly from62jfio at &amp;600 bo 55% at  2,000, these percentages being reduced to c7y and 10% by the operation of the present rates of income tax.   The incidence of the scheme, forthis range of salaries is thus more reasonable thanthat of the present bonus or of the Shaft&apos; side proposal.It ie submitted that the Official side beauthorized tc dndeavour to come to an agreement withthe Staff side on the lines of Scheme C,   It would bea condition of the agreement that a sliding scalearrangement should be operative under which the amountof bonus should rise or fail roughly in accordance withupward or ocvarrard fluctuations in cost of living.Such revisions should be made preferably at yearly(possibly half yearly) intervals on the basis of theaverage increase (or decrease) in cost of living forthe previous 12 or 6 months as the case may be.it it fairly certain that the Staff side willclaim that a substantial proportion of the bonus shouldbe deemed a permanent part of  alary on which pension &apos;will be awardable and it is submitted that this claimmay be conceded up bo at any rate 50% of the bonus now suggested as it is unlikely that for a generation atleast the cost, of living will shew a rise of less than621% over the pre-war index figure.   At the presentmoment
moment for pension purposes, 40$ of bonus is reckonablein the case of salaries up to  300.    For salariesabove that amount 30/&amp; of bonus is reckonable.In negotiating with the Staff side the official side does not propose to discuss what bonus should bepaid to officers in receipt of salaries over  500 (ora*. most  700)  a. year:    it is obviously more fittingthat the remuneration of the higher ranks of the service should be settled by iiinisters and should not form a subject of discussion with the staff *Appendices.

&quot;D&quot;t Banj ClerksThe practice at different Banks varies within wide limits.In most cases the *Cost of living&apos; increase consists partly of revised salary and partly of bonus, the latter amounts beingliable to review at stated intervals.    At one Bank the total increase amounts to 100$ on pre war salaries between  100 and 400 per annum.     At a second Bank the total increase varies from100$ for pre war salaries of  48 per annum to 85$ fo r pre warsalaries of  300 but salaries and bonuses are paid free of incometax, and there is an allowance to married men of  10 per childunder 16 years.At a third Bank the total increase for married men variesfrom (92$ for pre war salaries of  100 per annum.(74$   &quot;     &quot;     M        &quot; &quot;  300   M(40$   &quot;     &quot;     &quot;        &quot;  500   &quot;to     15$   &quot;     &quot;     &quot;        &quot; &quot; 1,000 &quot;but salaries are paid free of income tax and in the case of single men the increases are smaller.     At a fourth Bank thetotal increase apparently varies from 55$ for pre war salaries of 100 per annum to 35$ for pre war salaries of  1,000 per annum:and at other Banks the increase is even less.II. The Metropolitan Borough Councils are in many instancespaying the Oivil Service bonus to their clerical staffs,III. Hemen&amp;ary School headmasters in&apos;London.Scales of pay have been revised as follows:-
Date,Grade of School and ]&amp;accommodation.*  191411 19 20.Grade 1.(under 201) 15G- 7.1Gs.-  235. 26C- 15-  360.Grade II   -       Grade III      Grade IV(201-400)        (401-600)        (601 &amp; over) 200-10-300 340-20-440 300 - 10 -  400 440-25-540    440-25-590(These increases correspond roughly with the Civil Service Bonne,)In addition existing teachers retain a bonus of 30 granted in July,  1919,  as an increase in salary.    Thecorresponding scale s for Headmistresses are, at&apos; the mean, 66 lower for Grade I,  87 lower-for Grade II,     112 lower,for Grade III and  120 lower for Grade IV,
