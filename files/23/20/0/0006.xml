APPENDIX I

 NOTES OF POINTS, SUPPLEMENTARY TO HIS MEMORANDUM OF JANUARY 21, 1920, MADE BY SIR HALFORD MACKINDER IN REPLY TO QUESTIONS PUT TO HIM AT THE CABINET MEETING HELD ON THURSDAY, JANUARY 29, 1920, AT 11-30 A.M.

(These Notes have been approved by Sir Halford Mackinder.)

 SIR HALFORD MACKINDER, in reply to questions on the military situation in South Russia, said that General Denikin&apos;s failure had been due to a collapse in the centre. The wings, in the region of Kieff and Tzaritsin, had held. After the collapse in the centre the retreat had been deliberate, as it had been realised that the two wings of the army could not hold together with the deep indentation of the Sea of Azoff in their immediate rear. General Wrangel&apos;s army at Tzaritsin had not wished to retire at all. The retreat had, in the main, been orderly, except in the region round Taganrog.

 The line now held by General Denikin&apos;s forces was approximately the line which had been intended by General Denikin when he had seen him a few weeks ago, with the exception that Rostoff and Novotcherkask had fallen. This, possibly, was not altogether a disadvantage. Rostoff was a place of more than 200,000 inhabitants of whom many might be inclined to Bolshevism, and it would have had to be fed from the country of the Cossacks.

 The point about which he felt most immediate anxiety was the town of Perekop, on the isthmus connecting the Crimea with the mainland, which was reported to have been captured by the Bolsheviks. This isthmus, however  was reported to be defended by good troops. The position at Odessa depended to a great extent upon the German colonists and the relations between their leader and Denikin&apos;s General.

 For the moment, the situation on the Don front appeared to be stable, and ought not to become critical as long as the river remained in flood owing to the thaw. The present position was the more reassuring as the Don Cossacks were a less reliable element than the Kuban Cossacks, and General Denikin himself had expressed some doubts as to the effect on them of Bolshevist propaganda. General Wrangel, at Ekaterinodar, had a fortnight ago been engaged in recruiting among the Kuban Cossacks, and had hoped to raise two Corps. The Cossacks now formed one of the principal elements in Denikin&apos;s army. Apart from them, it consisted of the remnant of the Volunteer Army, which included some good troops, more especially some battalions of officers forming Corps d&apos;Elite. As explained in his Report, the compulsory service men had been influenced by propaganda and had drifted away.

 Novorossisk itself was very defensible, as it was covered by hills in which the Bolshevist Cavalry would not possess any advantage. In fact it should be possible to establish, as it were, a Torres Vedras line of defence.

 The Bolshevist Infantry was on all hands agreed to be contemptible. Their Cavalry, however, of which they disposed of very large numbers, and which were a comparatively recent development, had been the most, potent military weapon in their successes.

 The Bolshevist Army was only formidable, from a military point of view, against Russians, but there had been latterly marked signs of improvement, which were supposed to be the result of German assistance.


p-,. v-o to -lie: c fuj test &apos;&quot;use.    At the outset there was no doubt  ........ .some of the clothing sent out had found its way into cmncn hands,The Cossacks wore composed of three diatinot groups.    TheTerek Cossacks, at the foot of the eastern half of the &quot;Caucasus,  ne? dPnot be regarded as a serious element in the situation.    The Don Cos-C sacks were Great Russians, and the Kuban Cossacks were Little Russian^and much tougher people than the Don Cossacks.    The country of theKuban Cossacks, and the whole region of Ekaterinodar, was full ofAd\  -I1^ Go3saoks h^d already experienced one Bolshevist invasion,and at Exaterinodar there had been some looting.    It was thei* previous experience which prompted them to resist a second Bolshevist invasion.&quot;Probably they had no very clear political aspi-ations bevond a desi-efor local autonomy, as in a political sense they were backward people.It was certain, howfever, that they would not desire permanent economicseparation from Russia, which was the market for their produce. They -were a very democratic people.The country of.the Ukraine was generally understood at home to imply merely Petlurafs country.    In Poland and Rouraanla, however,the whole of the South of Russia as far eastward as the Don was regard?ed as the Ukraine.    The population of the Ukraine was,  in the main,hostile to the Bolsheviks.As regards the Poles, General Pilsudski had told him that hecould probably advance to Moscow next Spring,    (,?hen he got there,however, he asked himself as a politician what he should do?    He sawthat it would be necessary for him to go forward with some Russianelement.    This element could be furnished by Denikin&apos;s Government,which occupied a territory which was large actually, even though itwas small in comparison with the whole of Russia.    He had put it toGeneral Pilsudski that they would hive to be friends either of theGermans or of the Russians,  since Poland could not exist with enemieson all aides.    The General .had replied that he could not become friend-ly with Germany, and he could not trust the Bolsheviks to keep a treatyof peace into which they had entered.    It was impossible, however, for him to retain his army permanently on the Beresina.    Hence he had no alternative but to strike at the Bolsheviks next April or May.Sir Halfcrd. Mackinder agreed with General Pilsudski that aspectacular advance on Moscow was undesirable.    His object should be rather to advance in the Ukraine, with the object of obtaining posses-sion of the Donetz Basin.    In considering the extent of these advancesit was necessary to dismiss from one&apos; s mind the ideas of warfare onthe Western Front.    The war in Russia was a much more mobile wy.r, andthe forces far less highly trained.    It was only necessary to study thehistory of recent campaigns in South Russia to realise how extensivethese movements were.    It was very important, however, to avoid themistake of the previous campaigns&apos;,  and not to advance until the countryimmediately behind the army had been brought under proper admiuistra-t ion.In his conversations with General Pilsudski and general denikin he had made so much progress that he did not anticipate anyg^eat difficulty in arranging an agreement as to the eastern frontiersoVPoland.    If the plan he had outlined in his Memorandum was carriedout, it would be necessary to give both General Denikin and the Polesassistance not only of a material nature but also&quot;in the general direc-tion of affairs.    Ore of the worst features in Russia at the presenttime was that it had been bled white of brain power,  and people  didnot exist with the capacity to carry on the administration of thecountry.    This was, to some extent, true of the Bolshevixs, but theyhad enlisted the assistance of the Jews.Questioned as to whether the stores and war material of allk^nds s*nt&apos; oat by the British Government had been made the best possi-bile \is&apos;.of by General Denikin, Sir Halford MackJ.nd.er said that hefea-ed. t^is was net the case,    He escribed this -ra.ir.Iy &quot;to the iaaof *,c!mir.istratine capacity,   bo which he had already alluded. There hadbeen too much incapacity behind the lines for these stores to^be^ em-
and had even been used for clothing women, but drastic measures hadbeen taken and this had been stopped,&apos;     .     .       The British Military Mission had not been able to make aoodthe incapacity of the  Russians in this respect.    It included someyery good men,  particularly among those who had been sent out recent-ly, but Ms general impression of the British Military&apos; Mission hadnot been very favourable.    The British were very much looked up to inRussia, and when the care and use of  100,000,000 worth of storeswere in question he would like to have felt that only the ve-y bestpersonnel was employed,  and he did not feel this about the Mission.He realised that the men were not in units, and that  some admirableindividuals were included.    He had n* special defect to complain of,but he felt that there was a general ineffectiveness about the Mission.A British General,  lately arrived, who had accompanied him, had, hethought, derived a very similar impression.    He would not have men-tioned the matter unless he had been asked questions about the use ofthe military stores that had been sent out,In connection with the subjeot of war material, Sir HalfordMac-kinder pointed out that the whole of Soviet Russia was full of arms.When the armies of the old regime had dispersed they had taken their arms with them.    Consequently there were scattered over the countrysufficient quantities of arma to enable such exploits as Makhno&apos;araids to be repeated.Questioned as to railway organisation, Si&quot; Halford Maokinderstated that the Vladikavkas railway had a very good permanent-way inexcellent order, together with ample rolling-stock; &quot;in fact,  thesystem was at present choked with rolling-stock, most of which onlyrequired very slight repairs to be in full working order.    There was,however, a shortage of locomotives.    Owing to the &quot;retreat the sidingsand stations had become choked with wagons,  consisting mainly of fine,closed trueks, many of which atWrresent time were in&amp;sbitLd by refuse-gees.    The Administration had not the capacity to restore order on therailway, which was consequently very much congested.If his plan were adopted, it would be necessary to send out a directing staff to control the railway, together with some repairingplants.    Messrs Vickers were prepared *.o send out boilers and boiler-tubes in c&quot;der to reoair the engines.There was great corruption in the country, and that was why he advocated trade by means of merchant adventurers.    It was necessaryto establish direct communication between the importer and the peasant,as the peasant would not give up his produce except in return for what he required, via., agricultural implements and the essentials ofcivilisation.    By this system of direct trade and barter alone was it possible to eliminate graft, which was rife. The Co-operative Movementin Russia was not&apos; free from graft, and the Bolsheviks to some extentcontrolled the movement.He admitted that the whole weight of active organisation under his scheme in the war against the Bolsheviks would rest withthe British, but he pointed out, on the other side, that we should obtain what we required in the form of wheat, sugar, oil, etc., andthat in a single season he believed a great deal could be done tore-establish the position.    He did not think it would ever be necessaryto send British troops, as his plan was to build on the basis of the wealth of the country itself.    All that would be required would be afew individuals to supervise administration and regulate traffic onV--e railways.    The better the people sent,  the smaller the number required.    The question was largely one of moral.   At present theRussians considered that they had been let down by the Allies,  andl^was necessary to remove this impression.Sir Ealford Mackinder had no confidence in any isolated sup-po-t to the Caucasian States.    Baku was particularly likely to goBolshevist.    Moreover, he had pointed out in his  Report the evidence
of relations between the Bolsheviks, the Turks and oven the Azerbai-janians.    Yet, if some barrier were not oppoo-ed to the march of bolshevism,  it would-go forward like a prairie fire in Turkev andC&apos;    Central Asia.Tr-otsky, who had now got the principal control of the bolshevist movement, had practically given up the Communisticbasis, and the movement: was now almost in the Directory stage.He was opposed to all isolated action, and considered thatsalvation could only be found in a comprehensive policy such as was indicated in his Memorandum.    He would  range up all the anti-Bolshevist States, from Finland to the Caucasus, giving them acertain amount of support.    Denikin should be re-equipped on a more modest scale than before.    We must be prepared to hold the Baku-Batum line and to take control of Denikin&apos;s fleet in the Caspian.Any oolicv of support to individual States merely involved waste ofmoney without anything effective being done.    It.was necessary toadopt the whole policy or to do nothing.    The alternative was to seethe Bolsheviks come down to the Black Sea, to the Crimea and toOdessa, which would be a complete moral victory for them.    It wouldnot be necessary to d^ive his policy to extremes.    Once an alliancesuch as he contemplated had been created, and the moral of the anti-Bolshevist 3tate3 had been re-established, we should be in a much better position to obtain a Peace with a Soviet Russia which wasnot triumphant.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,January 29, 1920.
appendix If.^X^k^Ixm^31.2^1fovA J,, Mackinder* sBOilQJ!t^,the Situation in South Russia -&amp;S &amp;J3i&amp;&amp;L^^ But immediate steps must betaken if a constructive, and truly remedial policy is oontera-plated.   A firisi declaration by Britain, especially that shewill not make peace with Bolshevism should be issued;   it isshe and not France which is suspect;    it is her support andnot that of France which is valued;    it is Mr Lloyd George&apos;sdefinite promise and not that of M. Clemenceau which is desired, and ardently desired.     Timely assistance shouldbe given in naval and technical ways for the holding of theIsthmus of Perikop and the defended areas of Odessa andNovorosaisk.    Help in the way of&quot; loan should be promised tothe Pales, provided they ally themselves with Denikin onproper terms in regard to their eastern frontier.    TheDenikin Government should be recognised de, facto, providedthat its basis be broadened.    The organisation of the syndicatefor giving credit and for the control of imports into South&quot;Russia should be set on foot.    The position in the CaspianSea should be assured.    The Baltic Provinces, Georgia andAzerbaijan, should be brought into the Polish-DenikiniteLeague of Governments.The initial steps of such a policy would,  I am persuaded,send a thrill through all the east of Europe, which in a monthwould wholly alter the moral of the people in that part ofthe world.   Mere vague promises will not have much effectnow.    There have been too many of them, and the people ofRussia are too weary to be stimulated by anything but theopening moves of a coherent and energetic policy, whichshould then be carried through without hesitation.
