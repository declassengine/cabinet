THE TURKISH (l) With, reference to War Cabinet 619, Minute 1,PEACE TREATY-.- th8 Cabinet had before then the following- documents inTh^Putare **fOondtantino- connection with&apos; the Turkish Peace Treaty, and more particu-ple.larly the question of the future 01 ConstantinopleMemoranda by the Secretary of State forIndia (Papers CP.-326 and CP.-5fl2):A Keijuofandum by the Se ore tar:/ of Statefor War (Paper CP.-;342):Memoranda by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs (Papers CP--375 and cp.-392):A French Note and iiemoranda by theBritish Peace Delegation regardingthe Turkish. Settlement, December, 1919(Paper CP.-391):A Note by Sir Siaiirioe Hankey, containing the recorus of various statements made byMr Bait our during the Peace Conference,Parisj in regard to the future of Constan-tinople.It was explained to the Cabinet that the question wasone of Great urgency, in view of&apos; the forthcoming allied conference ir. Paris.    -The s^b^ect had been discussed on theprevious day at a preliminary Conference between the ministers at the head of the Departments principally concerned.    Thequestion had then been recognised to be one of extraordinarydifficulty, and a good deal of difference of opinion had arisen.The Prime Minister gave the Cabinet a salutary of thediscussion at this Conference, the Minutes of which are attached in Appendix I.    He explained that no decision hadbeen reached, bat the Secretary had been instructed to circulate Mr Balfour&apos;s statements, already referred to, anathe Chief of the Imperial General Staff, in conjunction withthe First   Sea Lord, had been asked to report on the following?questionAssuming that the Turk remains in Constan-tinople&quot;, what force, Naval and Military ,is necessary to guarantee the freedom ofthe Straits, and where should that forcebe placed;    the alternative suppositionsbeing that the enemy consisted cf -/(i) Russians,(ok) r       &apos;o:,;n:md Germans combined&quot;.
A Naval&apos; Appreciation, of the. TurKf sh-..Sltustlor. , inreply to the question put&apos;on the previous day, was then read to the Cabinet (Appendix II) *The Chief of the Imperial General Staff gave a summarycf the Military Appreciation.    Field-Marshal Sir Henry Wilsonsdocument was subsequently handed to the Secretary, and isattached in Appendix III.    The conclusions reached thereinare as follows:-(i) Control of the Black Sea can only be assured by the maintenance of a superior Allied,Fleetbased on the Eosphorus, but for the purposesof protecting the Straits against attacklight Naval forces should provide a reason-able degree of security.(ii) Assuming the frontiers of Turkey In Suropeto extend to the Snos-Midia line, and assuming-ing that the Sultan and the Turkish Governmentremain In Constantinople, a total of twoAllieu Divisions should be sufficientInsurance in peace-time.(iii) This force night be somewhat reduced ifTurkey In Europe is limited to the area between the Eosphorus and the Tchataltchalines.(Iv)  If, on the other hands the Sultan and theTurkish Sovefna.ent were removed into asia minor, the whole military position would be altered to our disadvantage, for in peace weshould lose both knowledge of his plans anapower to check his -preparations,and the powerful deterrent from evil-doing of our having the Sultan and the whole of hisGovernment under our guns would have die-appear so.  If, therefore, the Sultan andhis Government are removed from Constant!-no pie, a much larger garrison would berequired, and a more elaborate system ofdefence, especially on the Asia Minor side,where a veritable frontier with all Its dis-advantages and bickerings and constantaggravations would have to be set up.In reply to various questions, the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff explained that he had contemplated.that thewhole garrison of the area of Constantinople and the Straitswould have to consist of Allied troops.    He did not considerthat forces raised iron the local non-Turkish population ofthese regions could be relied on.    This would apply whetherthe Sultan vas kept in Constantinople or not.    He ampliri:,his reasons ior thinking that the military position wouldaltered to our disadvantage if the Sultan was removed fro:-
Constantinoplei    In that event it would be much harder, in   *time of peaces to get to kno^-wiia^-mili, werein progress in the-territories of Asia Minor under the Sultansooctroi.    In that event, if hostilities should arise, theAllies would liave to deal with regular Turkish forces underthe control of the Government of the Sultan, whereas if the sultan and his Government were in Constantinople they would only have to deal with insurgent forces of the type of thoseraised by Mustapha Keical.    Finally, if the Sultan were removed from Constantinople, the International State would have a frontier coterminous with the Turkish State, and this wouldhave to be guarded.    In his view the proposal to reduoe thisfrontier by drawing a line from the Black Sea to the Sea of marmora across the Peninsula of Ismid, and from the Sea of marmora to the Mediterranean to cover the Dardanelles, leaving the Turks on the littoral of the Sea of Marmora, was not a sound one from a military point of view.    It would place theTurks between the two Allied positions, and put the Navalcommunications through the Sea of Marmora in jeopardy.    Whenreminded that under the present proposals the Turks would bedisarmed and the Turkish shore of the Sea of Marmora neutral-ised, he pointed out that if the Russians were hostile thsymight arm the Turks.    He had not yet worked out the strengthof the force required to hold the boundary between the Intei-national State and the Turkish State, but it would involve a force considerably in exoess of the 30,000 men he estimated as necessary to maintain the freedom of the Straits with the sultan and his Government in Constantinople.    The Allied forces now in Turkey wsra quite insufficient to establish any boundarywhatsoever with Mustapha Kemal.    As regards the Bulajr : ii.es rhe considered a single battalion sufficient.    He had nutcontemplated that the Sultan would be allowed any miijlaryforce within the area of Constantinople and the Straits.
In the course of the discussion it was pointed out that the burden on the Allies of maintaining 30,000 men at or about Constantinople would be very considerable, and the whole of this burden would fall on Great Britain, France, and Italy. If Italy stood out Great Britain and France would have to supply contingents of 15,000 men apiece. It was suggested that some part of this force might be raised locally, or that a foreign legion might be enrolled. It was pointed out, however, that any local contingent would probably consist largely of Greeks, who would busy themselves with Hellenistic propaganda. It was stated, however, that, provided the Sultan was retained in Constantinople, Indian troops could furnish part of the British contingent. Attention was drawn to the very great military commitments already assumed by the British Empire in Mesopotamia, Palestine, Persia, &amp;c. This was recognised as a strong argument against the adoption of any system that would increase the burden of forces to be maintained for Constantinople and the Straits.

It was pointed out that under the proposals worked out between Lord Curzon and M. Berthelot, it had been contemplated that the Turkish State should be placed under regime of strict control which would render the maintenance of any considerable Turkish military forces extremely difficult. On the other hand, the view was expressed that one of the objects of removing the Sultan from Constantinople was to give Turkey a greater measure of independence than would otherwise be possible, and it was suggested that the control now contemplated was too stringent. It was explained, however, that control was necessary partly for financial reasons, but also in order to secure the protection of Armenians and other subject-races. In this connection it was urged that if control was imperative it was not a good plan to have two systems, one for the control of Constantinople and the Straits, and another for the control of the Turks in Asia Minor. It would be better to combine them by a single control over a Sultan


G .&quot;&quot; SuXtanr and.^-- C^rrej^nmeirt^ tinople.    Thiswould have the additional advantage of meeting the indian and Egyptian objections to the removal of the Sultan.Among the arguments against the retention of the sultan at Constantinople, which had been more fullystated at the Conference on the previous day (Appendix 1),It was urged that one effect of maintaining the Sultanwith his Government in Constantinople would be to reducehim to a mere puppet.     He and his Ministers would have to rely for thoir protection on the allied garrison.     Theposition of the Sultan would, therefore, be inferior tothat of the Khedive of Egypt, who, at any rate, was sur-rounded by his own troops.     The Turkish nation would bereduced to a mere vassal nation, end the Allies wouldvirtually be assuming responsibility for the governmentof Anatolia.     Would it really be possible, it was asked,for the Allied Powers to exercise effective control overTurkey through a Sultan and a Government in such a stateof vassalage?     How, it was asked, could pressure beapplied?     Supposing, for example, a Christian weremurdered and the Sultan was unwilling or unable to punishthe murderers, would it be necessary to remove him or hisGovernment?     What effect would that produce in India orEgypt?     At the present time the Sultan was completelyunder the power of the Allies, faut they were totallyunable to control events in Asia Minor, anci sack movementsas that of Mustapha kemal.     As regards the argument usedthat the Germans had not been deprived of Berlin, nor the austrians of Vienna, it was pointed out that the analogywas not at all close.     Berlin and Vienna were German and austrian cities respectively, but in Constantinople only a minority of the population was Turkish,     During the late war the Straits had been closed, against the Allies, withthe result that   the War had been prolonged for years.Surely, it would be a serious weakness to lea^e the SultcmStill master of the position, where he would be able tocontinue
continue the old Turkish geme of intrigue end playing offone Power against the other.      History had taught us that-.....the Turk was a danger to the peace of the world.    If the sultan were left in Constantinople, it was suggested that either Turkey would be reduced to the position of Egypt,or else Asia Minor would throw off the allegiance of the sultan.      It was urged that all the arguments in favourof retaining the Sultan at Conetantinople were &quot;short-range,Targuments, end that, on a longer view of the situation, itwould he found that British trade and British interestsgenerally wotxld be bettor served by taking advantage of thepresent opportunity which might never recur to get rid of turkish rale there.Attention was drawn to the statement made by the PrimeMinister in his speech to the (Trades Union leaders in-  -January 1918, that it was proposed to leave the Sultan inthe homelands of the Turkish race with his capital atConstantinople.      It was recalled, however, that this state-ment had been made with a view to its effect on the Warrather than on the eventual peace, and that it containedoffers to other Governments besides the Turks which had notbeen fulfilled.In regard to the objections to leaving the Sultan in constantinople, it was suggested that he might be allowed a personal guard, and that the policing of Constantinoplemight be left to the Turkish Government.    Pressure on the sultan by removing him or his Ministers would have to beexercised with the utmost discretion, and such drastic stepswoid be reserved only for the most serious occasions.Y*&apos;hile it was generally recognised that the question was one of the utmost difficulty,  and that very greatdisadvantages were involved whether the Sultan were allowedto remain at Constantinople or not, on a balance of thevarious arguments, it was by a considerable majority agreed--(&amp;l    That the Sultan and his Government should beallowed to remain at Constantinople without
,J f-- any Turkish force in this &quot;region under his control &quot;beyond possibly a guard and a police force;C* (b) That Constantinople and the region of theStraits should be garrisoned by an inter-national force of which the British Empirewould have to contribute a part:(c) That in notifying to the forthcoming Confer-ence in Paris this rejection of the provisionaldecision taken at the London Conference, thePrime Minister should have discretion to statethat the premature disclosure of the previous decision in the French Press, and the numerousarticles throwing the odium on to the BritishGovernment, had had great weight with theBritish Cabinet.(A note of dissent by Lord Curaon to these conclusions has been circulated (CP.407).iPBESENTA- (2)     The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theION OF THEJSASUEY OS     Chancellor of the Exchequer suggesting that the Cabinet1 CABINET1CRETAEIAT.    should authorise, as a permanent arrangement, the additionto its Secretariat of a seconded member of the TreasuryStaff ( CP.-332).The Chancellor of the -Exchequer pointed out that, informer days, before any large question, of policy involvingexpenditure was broxight before the Cabinet, it had beencustomary for the Department concerned to thrash it out inits financial details with the Treasury.      During the War,however, owing to the great pressure of business, this practice had gradually been dropped, and the custom had grown up of bringing such questions before the Cabinet without previous consultation with the Treasury.      His proposal were made with the object of providing some check on this practice, and he appealed to his colleagues to avoid it infuture as far as possible.On the understanding that the constitutional right oa Minister to raise questions at the Cabinet, whether onthe Agenda or not, was not prejudiced, the Cabinet agreed -To approve the proposals in CP.338.Whitehall Gardens,  S..W.1,January 6, 1920.

fDRIATIC 1.      With reference to Cabinet 18(19) Minute 5.  in view, of the expected arrival the same evening of SignorNitti and Signor Scialoja,  the Italian President tothe Council and Foreign kinistor,:the Conference-hads short discussion on the subject if Flume and the adriatic, which was adjourned until the Prime minister had seen Signor llitti.THE TURKISH     2.      The Conference had before than the followingPEACE TREATY *documents relating to the Treaty of Peace with Turkey:-Memoranda by the Secretary of State for India,(CP, 326 and C;P, 382) .Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War,(CP. 342) cMemorandum by tho Seoretary of State forForeign Affairs (CP. .375). .Cenoral agreement was expressed with tho followingfour principles sot forth in M, Bertholot&apos;s note of the12th December, 1919 (Page 5 of CP. 375):-(l)    Turkish militarism, like Prussian militarism,must be crushed.(2)    The custody of the Straits, fxom the black sea to the Mediterranean,  to be entrusted toan international organisation which shalleffectively secure their neutrality and free passage.(3)    The Armenians to be freed from Turkishdomination.(4)    The Arab and Syrian populations not to be handed&apos; back to the domination of tho Turk..The general line of negotiations between the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs and M.3ortL*lot was criticised on the following grounds:    although it had been understoodthat Lord Curzon and M. Berthslot were to prepare alterna-tive plans, the report of their conference revealed onlyone plan which was to turn the Turk out of Constantinople.Further, the Khalif was not even to be granted a residenceat Roum.    Again,&apos;the suggestion which had bean put forward
by the Secretary of State for India and concurred in by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, that the Turk should remain in nominal sovereignty over all the country which the Prime Minister in January 1918 declared should be his, but that we should compel him to leave the administration of Turkey in Europe to an International Commission governing on his behalf, had apparently been dismissed without any consideration. Great stress was laid upon the effect which the expulsion of the Turk would have in India. It was asserted that secret information had been received to the effect that, from the moment this Treaty was signed, we should have for the first time a movement, comparable to the Sinn Fein movement, breaking out in India, in favour of complete separation from England. The stigma and onus of such a Peace would be upon the British Empire, a fact of which the French would take the fullest advantage; the French papers were already saying that it was now up to the French to protect the interests of Mohammedans. Attention was drawn to the following extract from one of the discussions between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and M. Berthelot (Page 19 of C.P. 375), "Lord Curzon said that on the assumption that something like the present proposals of the Peace Terms with Turkey were accepted by the other Allies, he hoped that the military difficulties of imposing them on Turkey would not be ignored; it would be disastrous to dictate a peace that the Allies had not the military strength to enforce;" and the Conference was urged to consider the importance of looking at the military aspect of the question and to consider what forces and what length of time would be required to impose such a Peace. Again, the proposed Peace would not be a fait accompli as it would inevitably involve further fighting/


fighting. From tho jvotttfc of view of India and of theposition of the British Empire as a great Mohammedan&quot;boon suggested as thoy leave no free Turkey at all,      the&quot;Garten&quot; disappears, and Santa Sofia is for the first time touched and was to (become an international monument.Tho view was expressed that at a previous Conference ithad &quot;been agroed that the Turk should he loft at Constantl-noplo with titular sovereignty, and with the Straits under an International Commission;    this was precisely tho kindof settlement mutatis mutandis which was put forward bythe Conference itself for the administration of Adrianopleand Smyrna;    why then could it not be also adopted forConstantinople?     Again, nothing was said in the ForeignOffice document as to what would happen in Syria.     Therewere rumours that the French had put certain propoeitisnsto Feisal which he had either rebooted or opposed.      It wasnot clear whether the French intended virtually to annexSyria, which would be contrary to our agreement with them of November, 1918;    if so, Feisal might make common causewith the Turk and eventually with the Bolsheviks.     Thiswould mean that we should have trouble In Persia, thenwith Feisal, then with the Bolshoviks, and finally withthe Turks, if we turned thorn out of their Capital.      Itwas urged that our course should be to achieve the four points cited above, with as little disturbance of the mapas possible.     We had destroyed Austria which would causeendless trouble,  and it was disastrous to destroy Turkey also.We should toll the Turks that we intended to keep thorn inorder but we also intended to help them.     If wo razeevery fort along the Straits, limit the Turkish army,oontrol Constantinople with the Svitan thero under oureye, set up an International Commission and an Internation-al Police Force, the Turk must be helpless.     The Sultanpower tho present proposals worethe worst that had yetand/
and his Government could be much more effectively controlled if he remained at Constantinople than if he was ejected. It was stated that Sir George Lloyd, the Governor of Bombay, who had before his departure for India favoured turning the Turks out, was now of the opinion that it would be the greatest possible mistake to do this. With the exception of Colonel Wilson and Miss Bell, all Indian and Mosopotamian experts including Sir George Roos-Keppel, Sir M. O&apos;Dwyer and Lord Willingdon, shared Sir Goorge Lloyd&apos;s view. The progressive boycott of British goods and a general refusal of all Government measures had been organised in India to meet the contingency of this Treaty being signed.

 Attention was drawn to the larger aspect of the case. The Bolsheviks had now a very powerful army, consisting of all their best troops, which had been withdrawn from the Koltchak front in order to crush Denikin, down in South Russia, and they would shortly be in touch with Turkish Nationalists. They were probably already in possession of Krasnovodsk. Every day they were making great strides towards the East, in the direction of Bokhara and Afghanistan. They were carrying out a regular, scientific, and comprehensive scheme of propaganda in Central Asia against the British. We ourselves had no military forces wherewith to oppose them; in fact, at the moment, our troops were at their lowest ebb and we shortly should not have a single friend from Constantinople to China. We could not, of course stem all this by keeping the Sultan at Constantinople, but to turn him out would be to add one more spark to the spreading conflagration.

 The Chief of the Imperial General Staff expressed the view that if we wished to retain power over the Turk we should leave the Sultan in Constantinople. If we blew up the forts in the Dardanelles there would be no further


danger, and a single policeman on shore with a Guard-ship  .in the harbour would suffice to secure the Straits.    Inreply to a question, General Wilson said that there were atpresent in Constant inoy iLe about 13,000 or 14,000 Britishtroops and one French Division.     With the collapse of Denikln the Caspian would fall into the hands of theBolsheviks who could then land at Enzeli and createdisturbance in North Persia.    The unrest would spread to   Afghanistan, which was already very unsettled, andalso to India which was reported to be in a more dangerousstate to-day than it had teen for the last thirty years.We had enough   troops on the spot to hold Mesopotamia and constantinople hut only just enough, and if the ICurdsjoined the Bolsheviks our position would be precarious.It was very difficult to decide where best to defendIndia.     One line of defence might .be Batoura-Baku, butthis would only be possible if the Turks were friendly tous.     All military opinion was opposed to ejecting the Turkfrom Constantinople.It was suggested that the Naval and Military Authoritiesshould be &amp;a&amp;ed to consider how we could make the Dardanellesand the entrance to the Black Sea secure, and whether the turk could, or oould not improvise fortifications on the   &apos;islands to prevent this*tIt was stated that, in respect of the Haval and military measures to be taken to secure the Dardanelles, in theopinion of the Naval Authorities it would not ma^ce muchdifference whether the Sultan were or were not atConstantinople.
In. reply to these criticisms it was podJitecL out(a) That.it was not our fault that alte-rn^dd^re^jiLans,were not submitted.     M.. Clemenceau had thought it best thatthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and M. Iwftlfc&amp;Jotshould meet and state  the views of their - respective Govern-ments.     Before they mot M. Berthelot had handed to Lord Curzona paper which, to the latter&apos;s surprise, was not a basis ofdiscussion but a complete surrender to our view;(b) That, as regards the Vatican solution,  this hadbeen put forward for discussion at the recent Anglo-french conference, but it had been absolutely ruled out by M.Cleraenceauwho declared that one &quot;Pope&apos;&quot; was enough;(o)      In regard to Santa Sofia,  there was no greatobjection to leaving this as a Mosque, although the 470 years it had been a Mosque were more  than balanced by the 9 20 yearsof Christian occupation;(d) Lord Curzon and M. Borthelot had not been authorisedto discuss Syria.      Officially we had not been informed of what had passed in Paris;    but we had received unofficialreports that the French proposed a virtually French protector-ate, which was strongly opposed by Feisal, who had consultedLord Ourzon as to the line he should tales and had been advised by him to consult the Peace Oouference.      Feisal had giveninnumerable assurances to us that in no case would he intriguewith the Turk, but that he would accept whatever solution we suggested that was consistent with his honour.(e) It was not correct to say that we propose to abolish a free Turkey in Asia Minor and place the TurksIn manacles.    The proposal of the Conference was to givethe Turk Anatolia as far as Cilicia in the Southland up ^0the boundaries of Armenia to the Morth-East.    Moreover it ^ashoped to get the Greeks out of Smyrna by giving them oompensa-tion in Thrace.      The Turkish exasperation was mainly due tothis Greek occupation of Smyrna, and the desire of Lord Curzonand M. Usrthelot was that Anatolia,  free from any mandate and free/
free   frnm Greeks and&apos;Xtalians-,-^hrOulcL It1 fwas printed out that there were good reasons for the much A *-criticised financial control;    there were the interests to benonsidered of the bond-holders of the pre-war--Ottoman-debrtr^erver.after allowing for the portion of the interest to be paid bythe occupied territories,  3-4- million sterling would have to bereceived, annually from Turkey.    Unless we took control of theTurkish finances, how would we possibly maintain the cost ofthe armies of occupation ?    Moreover the trade of the Britishjgmpife would be lost if Turkey fell into chaos.    Our tradebefore the war with Turkey was 26fc as against Germany&apos;s 14^ andFranc0312^;    in other words,  British commercial interestshad been nearly twice those of any other power.   Loss of tradein Anatolia meant thousands out of work in&apos;Manchester.    It wassuggested that although there might be considerable agitation in India over the Turkish Treaty,  this agitation was a fic-titious one, was organised by familiar methods and would be short-lived.   As regards the various experts quoted it waspointed out that,  besides Col. Wilson and Miss Bell,  two ex-Viceroys, Lord curzon and Lord Hardinge with the combined experi-ence of twelve years of India,were of the opposite view; and theywere supported by Admirals Calthorpe and de P.obeck,  who had represented this country at Constantinople,  and had repeatedlyexpresse^&amp;heir considered opinion that the Turk should go.    Thiswas also the view of the two Foreign office officials,  now atConstantinople, Mr. Hohler and Mr. Ryan (dragom m. ffer 30 years in Turkey and suspected of pro-Turk sympathy)  and an extractfrom a dispatch from Mr. Hohler was read to the Conference inwhich the following words occurred;    &quot;a certain lesson to be derived from history is that the Turk is incapable of governinghimself much less other nations  ..... There is a great risk ofover estimating Moslem feeling,&quot;    The Turk is a born hereditaryintriguer,  and for centuries had been a blight and curse to europe; and it was urged that a unique opportunity new presenteditself for removing a festering sore.    Egyptian expert      opinion was also stated to be divided.
(Col. Wilson&apos;3 telegram No. 941 of the 23rd January, 1919i ......was read -to the Conference,  emphasising the importance tfejecting the Ottoman GoYerament from Constantinople.It was pointed out that the then C:mma.nder-in-Chi ef,General Marshall had concurred in this view,  and it wasetated that Col. Wilson adhered to-lay to the opinion hethen expressed.)In respect of the military arguments,   it was pointed outthat the Military problem might be reduced in proportion, butit would not be solved by leaving the Turk in Constantinople.The problem was Mustapha Kemal, who was a nationalist and snappedhis fingers at the Sultan.    What had to be faced.in the futurewas a nationalist movement.    Was that menace made greater $rless by leaving the T urk in,Constantincple ?    This wa3 a dis-putable point.    if he were left there,, the whole Moslem world would say that he had triumphed after all.    Twice had the Alliescome to a deoision to eject tfce Turk. - First early in the war when Russia was to go there.    This, When published by Kerenskydid not raise a flutter.    The second occasion was in 1917 atan international Conference when Mr. B^balfour wrcte a dispatcht* the United states restating the whole position,  and urging the ejection of the Turk.(in regard to the reference which had been made tc theprime &quot;Mini sterns statement on war aims,   the fallowingextract was read out from theMinutes of the Meeting yf the/-&quot;War cabinet held on Fanuary 3rd 1918, War Cabinet 313,minute-e 3-.&quot;The prime Minister urged that the War Cabinet shouldnot neglect to consider the drafts from the point ofview of their value as. a counter offensive to theGerman peace move . . It was essential that this statement should be regarded rather as a war movethan as a peace move.....    What kept the Turks fighting was the fear of dismemberment and of losing Constantinople.If they knew they would, retain the Turkish part oftheir empire,   they might be much less inclined to fight
 It was suggested that if the Turks were left at Constantinople there would be a potential head of the Pan-Turanian movement in the old sacred city, that that movement would be thereby invested with a high significance and the dangers envisaged by the C.I.G.S. would be accentuated.

 On the other hand the importance of having Turkey under control was again strongly urged. It was pointed out that the Foreign Office document would leave no Turkey at all. However, if we decided to accept it we should be in a much better position to enforce it if we had the Turk under supervision at Constantinople. It was suggested that M. Clemenceau had in mind, if there were International control of the Straits, the other Powers would gradually get tired of it and the French would take the opportunity to pose as the friends of Islam while we should appear as the enemies of Turkey. The control of the Straits was absolutely necessary and this would be easier if we had Constantinople. The present Government of India was unanimous that it would be disastrous to remove the Sultan. The same view was held in Egypt and Field Marshal Allenby had stated that his position would be rendered most difficult if the Turk were ejected from his Capital. Similarly in Mesopotamia if we alienated the Turk our work would become impossible.

 It was suggested that it was not correct to ensure that official opinion was unanimous on this question, as many Egyptian officials were known to advocate turning the Turk out.

 It was recalled that Balfour had never swerved from the view that the Turk ought to go. Supposing the Turk were left in Constantinople with a Guard-ship permanently stationed there, it was possible that some power would


start intriguing.    The contingency of a hostile Russia could, not be ignored, particularly in view of the probable victory of the bolshevists,  and we had certainly done air host to estrange the bolshevists who had greater reason to hats us than any othorPower; but o victorious Bolshevist Russia would be  infinitelymore powerful with the Turk at Constantinople.    In the event of warwith Russia and an attack .on India and Persia the first effort-lould be to block tho, Bosphorus.    Surely a Russia, in alliance with turkey and perhaps Germany would, find some moans to  achieve this.By sending Marshal von Bieberstein, a clever diplomatist, to turkey Germany had before the war entirely superseded British influence at Constantinople.    This did not support the view that any permanent and  reliable friendship could be made with the TurksiWho were the Turks?      Often indifferent and unreliable people likeTallat and Enver who had somehow forced their way to the top.The Allies would be regarded as rather &quot;soft&quot; for after being soseverely let d-wn by the Turks we said &quot;We will trust you now and allow you to remain.&quot;      If the Sultan were removed from Constanti-nople it was pointed out that there would be an InternationalArmy which would command the Straits.    It was suggested, however,that if the Turk were turned out of Constantinople he should begiven a greater measure cf Independence than was contemplated atpresent;  and that the  &quot;roper oolicy was to leave the Turk the samemeasure of freedom and independence as Persia now enjoyed.As regards the suggestion that the Turks might refuse to sign the Treaty,  it was pointed out that the Allies, in order to enforce the Treaty, had no necessity to advance into Turkey, sines they weralready in occupation of all the districts to be wrested from the turk, e.g.  Constantinople,  Smyrna., Cilicia, Syria, etc. they couldeven, moreover, occupy Brusa or rofu.se to evacuate Konia.    Itwas suggested that the Moslems were not likely to play the Bolshe-vist game as their mentality was entirely different.    In any event,he was not more likely to unite with the Bolshevists because the turk remained in Constantinople.
On the contrary, with the Turk in Constantinople, the bolshevist would have an overwhelming inducement to conquerthat city, .   If the Turks were relegated to Anatolia, the bolshevists would get little by attempting to co-operate withthem, owing to the indifferent communications.     A suggestion was made that whether the Sultan was at Constantinople or not,there would be an inter&apos; national force guarding the Straits,and it would be better that the Sultan should be allowed to stay In Constantinople where he would be more Immediately underthe control of that force.The Conference was reminded that the policy of the british delegates in Paris had always been to get the United states to undertake the policing and control of the Straits and constantinople,.     If the United States now joined the proposed international Commission, It would mean that Russia would not attack unless she lit ended to wage reckless war upon the whole world.The view wa3 put forward that at the time when lord curzon was Viceroy of India, and In the early days of lord hardinge&apos;s tenure It would   have been most unlikely that to       jeject the Turk from Constantinople would have raised anyreally formidable agitation.      Since those days, however, anominous change of feeling had come over the inhabitants ofIndia largely owing to the roto real of Lord Curzon&apos;s policy.We could no longer rely   upon India&apos;s public opinion and support.      The weak policy of the Indian Government in theearly days of the war had had a bad effect,      The feeling of unrest and hostility to Great Britain in India could, however,Ibe mitigated by letting the Sultan remain in Constantinoplewith an international force controlling the Straits.
It was agreed that it was desirable that theMilitary and Naval Experts should examinewithout delay what military and naval forces would be required to keep the Straits open.After some discussion as to the terms ofreference to the Experts it was dec idea:-(a) That the C,hO.S, in conjunction withthe First Sea Lord assuming that the turk remains in Constantinople should consider and report with the least possible delay what force naval andmilitary is necessary to guarantee the freedom of the Straits, and wherethat force should be placed^ thealternative suppositions being thatthe enemy consisted of(l) Sussiana.(il) Russians and Germans combined.(The First Lord undertook to notify the First Sea Lord of the above decision)(b) That the Secretary should circulate tothe Cabinet, copies of the memorandum which Mr. Balfour prepared for theUnited States on the &quot;subject of theTurkish Peace.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.6th January. 19 2(5.

NAVAL APPRECIATION OF TURKISH SITUATION IN REPLY TO QUESTION PUT BY THE CABINET

(a) Black Sea.

 If a reconstituted Russia maintains a big Fleet in the Black Sea it would be necessary to keep a corresponding Naval force at Constantinople if the assured command of the Black Sea were required.

 A lesser degree of control could be ensured by a force of submarines and aircraft based on Constantinople. Such a force would act as a strong deterrent to an enemy in the Black Sea who contemplated landing a large force anywhere in the vicinity of Constantinople, either on the European or Asiatic shores.

 In expressing the foregoing views, the assumptions are made :-

 Firstly: that Constantinople would be a safe Naval Base, i.e. that both sides of Bosphorus would be held by Allied Forces.

 Secondly: that the Turkish Naval Forces in the Aegean Sea, Sea of Marmora, and Black Sea, are limited to mere police work.

(b) Sea lines of Communication between Great Britain and Constantinople.

 With the safety of the passage through the Dardanelles guaranteed from the land side, the Admiralty can guarantee sea lines of communication between home ports and Black Sea. Germany has no Mediterranean base, and any Naval Forces Germany may possess will be contained by British Forces in home ports and in the Mediterranean.

In the circumstances given in the problem it seems reasonable to suppose that our possible enemies might be increased by theaddition of Bulgaria and Turkey.   -Prompt action by the former-in the direction of Constantinople&apos; would not be easy, firstly,because it would be necessary to penetrate the buffer State ofGrecian Thrace and secondly,&apos;-because she would have to be certainthat Roumania and Serbia were neutral or effectively neutralised,3.     The early intervention by Russia depends mainly on, herpower to transport troops across the&apos; Black Sea,      The Naval staff is of opinion that if a reconstituted Russia maintains a bigFleet in the Blaek Sea, it would be necessary to&apos; keep a corresponding naval force at Constantinople if the assured&apos; command of the black Sea were required, -A lesser degree of control could be ensured by a force of submarines and aircraft based on Constantinople. -   Such a force would act as a strong deterrent to an enemy in the Black Sea whocontemplated landings large force anywhere in the vicinity ofConstantinople,-. el the? on the European or Asiatic shores.TheA8.sumpti.ana&apos;
The accession of Germany would not affect the militaryproblem in the early stages since she could not intervene for aconsiderable time., whilst from the naval point of view her action could only he directed towards improving the efficiency of theRussian fleet,4.      From the ebove.it is reasonable to suppose that the Alliescould reinforce Constantinople by sea via the Dardanelles considerably quicker than any of our enemies could concentrate for itsattack and the problem therefore.tc reduced to providing a peacegarrison whioh can secure both the Dardanelles and the Bosphorusagainst attack by tho Turks alone, and this again is qualifiedby assumption (c).    Another factor bearing on the problem is thoextent of territory loft to the Turks in Europe.    The area upto the Enos-I/iidia line contains a population of 1-f- millions andalthough In the time of peaoe it should be possible to maintainthe comparatively effective control of arms in this area, thefact remains that on the. outbreak of war eome 60 miles of coastline on the Black Sea would be left In.possibly hostile hands.Further, a certain number of Allied troops would bo swallowed upin watching the Tohataltcha lines and the Bulair Isthmus.    these could be dispensed with if the Greek occupation, stretched downto the Tchataltcha lines,    A description of these two positionsIs attached in Annex A.    Taking.into consideration the factthat we shall be acting on interior.lines, with complete control othe Sea of iiarmora, and supported on all flanks by the Navy, withthe possible exception of that resting on the Black Sea, it isconsidered that two Brigades should be sufficient in the firstinstance to secure the Tchataltcha lines against.a coup de main,whilst if all fixed defences on the Gallipoli Peninsula aredestroyed a maximum of one Battalion in the Bulair lines shouldbe ample so long as the Greeks maintain their position in thrace;  this Battalion would not of, course be necessary ifGrecian Thrace was brought as far East, as tho, Tohataltcha lines^
5.     On the Asiatic side we must cover the Dardanelles andthe Bosphorus... The determining feature in both&quot;eases is the capacity of the communications available for a hostile attack.Taking .the Dardanelles first, a description is &quot;given in annex B, from which it will, be seen that the&quot; country isunfavourable for the. movement of large bodies of troops andparticularly.. for. heavy. artillery, although the extent of frontto be covered, is considerable.    Assuming, however, that our intelligence is good? it should be very difficult for the enemy to concentrate sufficient forces, and particularly the heavy artillery necessary to close the Straits against the passageof our ships, it being assumed, of course, that all fixedseaward defences have been destroyed. .. In peace time it isconsidered, therefore, that one Brigade- in the neighbourhood ofChanak and a second Brigade at Kum Ka. 1 e-:-should be sufficient,provided that the Turks, are debarred fro?n maintaining orbringing any armed men across the Chan .Chai-Mender Chai line(20 miles east of the Dardanelles).6,      Bosphorus...approached by the Anatolian..Railway,. though otherwise the communications are not particularly favourable.    The railway,,from betveem Ishmid and Scutari, is, however, in several placesexposed to fire from the sea, and it is- thought&quot; that theaddition of two Brigades to IShose- already^^ detailed for theTchataltcha lines should be a sufficient.insurance in the firstinstance.    This would give a total in- the-Bosphorus area ofone Division, plus one Brigade,  capable of acting on either&apos;sideof the Straits.    The question of naval, control.in the &quot;Black Seawould, however,, have an important bearing on this question,.and &apos;it would be necessary for the Navy to--ensure that Russian&apos; &apos;&apos;troops could not be-landed within striking distance of&apos;the Bosphorus at -an early stage., -This is the most dangerous line of advance,&quot;since it is
4,2GThe Naval Staff id cf opinion that even In the face of a superiorRussian Fleet the adequate provision of Allied light naval forces(submarines, seaplanes,  etc,)  should render such an operationexceedingly hazardous,T.      The strengths of garrisons required must always depend verylargely on the extent to which Turkish forces can be prevented from arming and on receipt of timely information cf an impendingattack in order that necessary reinforcements can be provided intime.    It is considered that both those objects would be served ifthe Sultan and the.Turkish Government can be maintained in Constan-tinople.    Apart from the fact that a gradual change in the orient-ation cf Turkish policy in favour of the Allies might therebyresult,  it is considered that the task of preparing and launchinga surprise attack against the Allies would be extremely difficultso long as the Turkish Government, remained under cur military control. J6&apos;      Conclusions.(i)    Control of the Black Sea can only be assured by themaintenance of a superior Allied fleet based on the Bosphorous, butfor the purposes of protecting the Straits against attack lightnaval forces should provide a reasonable degree of security,(li)    Assuming the frontiers of Turkey in Europe to extendtc the Enos - Midia line, and assuming.that the Sultan and theTurkish Government remain in Constantinople a total of two allied divisions should be a sufficient insurance in peace time.-   (iii)    This force might be somewhat reduced if Turkey inEurope is limited to the area between the Bosphorous and theT-chs 1- ,.ltcha lines.(Iv)    If on the other hand, the Sultan and the TurkishGovernment w. re removed Into Asia Minor the whole military positionwould
l 50would be altered to our disadvantage, for In peace we should loseboth knowledge of his plans and power to check his preparations andthe powerful deterrent from ev^,l doing of our having the Sultan and thewhole of his Government under our guns would have disappeared.    If,therefore, the Sultan and his Government are removed from Ccnstanti-nopie a much larger garrison would be required, and a more elaboratesystem of defence&apos;,  especially on the Asia Minor side, where averitable frontier with all Its disadvantages and bickerings andconstant aggravations would have to be set up.(Intd)    H.W.C.I.G.S.

ANNEX   &quot;AM.DEFENSIVE LINES IN THRACE.The .CHAT-ALJA lines form the principal lines of defenceof CONSTANTINOPLE against attack by land&quot;from the west.    the peninsula of CHATALJA is about. 4*? miles in Length and 25&quot; miles in breadth.    The CHATALJA lines extend right across thispeninsula, at a distance of about 20 miles, from CONSTANTINOPLE.They consist of a line of detached forts along a prominentridge which crosses the peninsula at right angles at a point where it has been narrowed by lakes on either flank,  the wholeforming a position of exceptional strength.The only road from ADRIANOPLE, the only metal roadentering CONSTANTINOPLE from the west, crosses the lines on the extreme left, of the defences *The. best, and most probable lines of advance on CONSTAN-TINOPLE are. along the railway and the LULEBURGAS&apos;- CHORLUroada      A. $secondary line of advance lies through KIRE KLLISSA,SERAI and GHERKESSKEUI.      There are no roads through&apos;thewooded hilly districts along the BLACK SEA coast.THE GALLIPOLI PENINSULA. 1The GALLIPOLI peninsula, is protected by the BULAIR lines,which fa$e north east at the head of the peninsula, 7 mileanorth of GALLIPOLI town.      Before the War,  those lines consists,;!of three separate systems which,  during the far have been con-siderably strengthened, and provide.&apos; complete protection againstinvasion from the mainland for the D^dardanelles forts.    The totallength from sea to sea is about 7,000 yards.,  and in the hands of&apos;a Power commanding the sea on both flar&amp;s is an Extremelystrong position.The only metal road in the peninsula runs from GALLIPOLItown through the BULAIR lines to KAYAK and thence to A3RIAN0PLEand RODOSTO.Apart from a landing at RODOSTO or some other point on theSea of MARMORA, any advance on the BULAIR lines^   Would be made from the general direction of. ADRIANOPLE and would&apos; be confined to the one metalled road from UZUN KEUPRI to KESHAN and KAYAK..The nearest Railhead to the portinsula is at KESIIAN, whichis 30 to 40 miles northwest of the BULAIR lines.      This is a.branch of the main CONSTANTINOPLE - ADRIANOPLE line.
ANNEX &quot;B&quot; .DEFENCES OH THE- ASIATIC SHORE OF THB B0SPH0RU3.The total length of the BOSPHORUS,  including numerouswindings,  is 17 miles, the breadth averages 1-^- miles but is only 700 yards at its narrowest part opposite KANBILI.The country on the Asiatic shore is muoh more difficult formilitary operations than that on the European side.The ALEM BAGH and its minor ramifications are steepand difficult with numerous small ravines and few cart tracks.This range is some 8 to 10 miles east of the BOSPHORUS.The objective of an enemy advance from the east wouldbe this  crest which overlooks all the forts    of the defences.The principal line of communications is by the ANATOLIANRailway from ESKI3HEHR and ISKID,  and this would appear to bethe only feasible line of advance,  but beyond ISHIP it  iscommanded from the sea.DEFENCES ON THE ASIATIC SHORE OF THE DARDANELLES.&apos;The length of the DARDANELLES STRAITS from the entrance(KUM KALE)  to GALLIPOLI is about    40 miles..    The country on the asiatic shore would be extremely difficult for militaryoperations.      The only possible lines of advance appear to be:-(l)    The partially metalled road from BRUSA     and PAKBSRUA&quot;via BIGHA,    This line could be cut from the sea atPANPERMA.(2) From BRUSA, via BALIKHISSAR and EPREJflP to EZILE ancL,,CHANAK, but this line is vulnerable from the sea for;a considerable distance between EPREMID and CHANAK.The other routes in the BIGHA peninsula are cart tracks,in places very rough and bad,  s.g-. , from TERZILER to BIYUK-TEPEKEUI and BIGHA.The nearest railway is the PANUSRMA - SMYRNA Railway (enan average 90       -to    100 miles east of the Straits).To safeguard tha Asiatic shore it would seem desirable tohold ;.CU KALE,   CHAJSTAK,  BERGAE and possibly CHARDAK, whilst a   ,garrison at BIGHA would command the most likely line of approach;. .&apos;
[This Doeument is the.Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]APrtnted for the Cabinet.   January 1920.30SECRET.THE  PEACE  WITH TURKEY.&quot;i ASK to place on record, my earnest and emphatic dissent from the decisionarrived at by the majority of the Cabinet yesterday in opposition to the advice of thePrime Minister and two successive Foreign Secretaries to retain the Turk in constantinople. I believe this to be a short-sighted and, in the long ran, a most fortunate decision.In order to avoid trouble in India largely manufactured and in any caseephemeral-and to render our task in Egypt less difficult its difficulty being in realityalmost entirely independent of what we may do or not do at Constantinople we arelosing an opportunity for which Europe has waited for nearly five centuries, and whichmay not recur. The idea, of a respectable and docile Turkish Government atConstantinople, preserved from its hereditary vices by a military cordon of the Powers including, be it remembered, a permanent British garrison of 10,000-15,000 men is in my judgment a chimera.Nor will it be found that the decision, if carried into effect in Paris, will eithersolve the Turkish problem or calm the Eastern world.The Turk at Constantinople must have verv different measure meted out to him &apos;from the Turk at Konia.    He will retain a sovereignty which will have to be a meresimulacrum, and those who have saved him will, unless I am mistaken, presentlydiscover that his rescue has neither satisfied him nor pacified Islam.But beyond all I regret that the main, object for which the war in the East wasfought and the sacrifice of Gallipoli endured namely, the liberation of Europe from theOttoman Turk has after an almost incredible expenditure of life and treasure been thrown away in the verv hour when it had been obtained, and that we shall have leftto our descendants who knows after how much further sacrifice and suffering? a tasktroin which we have flinched.I may add that the refusal of the Cabinet to endorse- the scheme prepared byM. Berthelot and myself was resolved upon without any consideration by them of whatthe rival scheme will be, i.e., a Turkish State still centred at Constantinople but under-international supervision.    When produced it may cause some surprise.CURZON OF KEDLESTON.Foreign Office, January 7, 1920.
