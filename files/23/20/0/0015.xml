(3) The attention of the Cabinet was called to the neoeasiof making some provision for continuing the control of hopsfor a period of three years beyond the two years allotted tothe Food Ministry.The Cabinet requested  The Food Controller to insert a Clause inthe new Bill transferring, the control ofhops to the Board of Trade forthwith.?J0R CONTROL,    (4) The Cabinet were informed that,  as the present powersof the Food Controller to limit the price and gravity ofalcohol would shortly lapse, and as no provision for theircontinuance had been made in the War Emergency Laws (Continu-ance) Bill,  some Clause should be inserted in the Ministry of
possibly in the Emergency Laws Bill now with the House ofLords.The Cabinet  requested  The Chairman of the Home Affairs Committeeto arrange with the Attorney-General forthe insertion of Clauses to continue thepresent powers of the Pood Controller inregard to alcohol in the War &quot;mergeney Laws(Continuance) Bill.(5) The Cabinet had before them Memoranda by the Ministerof Health (Paper CP.-837), by the First Lord of the Admir-alty (Paper CP.-861), by the Secretary of Htate for :T&apos;ar(Paper C.F.-872), dealing with -&quot;he provisions of the Represen-tat ion of the People Bill introduced by Mr Grundy,  togetherwith the following decisions of the Home Affairs Committee(H.A.C.-5S, Minute 4) :-&quot;The Committee agreed(1) That the question of principle as towhether the Government would or wouldnot oppose the extension of the fran-franchise to women of SI be referred as amatter of policy to the Cabinet.(2) That the Government  should oppose theremaining provisions of the Bill inthe Comroittee stage.&quot;It was pointed out that the Bill would involve,  int.eralia,  the extension of the parliamentary franchise to women of 21* and had other highly controversial features, but thatthe Hill had already been read a second time.The Cabinet decided  (a) That the Minister of Health should maintain,on behalf of the Government, an attitude of independence to the Bill in Committee stage,and should make it plain that so wide an ex-tension of the suffrage at the instance of aPrivate Member&apos;s Bill was unprecedented, andthat if the Bill became law the Governmenthad no intention of following previous prac-tice and arranging a General &quot;lection:(b) Subject to the above,  the Minister should support the following provisions:-1. Application of Residence qualificationto women of full age on same terms asmen (Clause 1)&apos;ii. Age Qualification for University fran-6hi.se in the case of women to be 31,as in the case of men (Clause 3):
iii.. Application of&apos;Business Premises 24 GQualification (if its abolitionis rejected) to women of full ageon the same terras as men.(c) The remaining proposals in the Bill shouldbe opposed.Ou    (6) The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Chan-cellor of the Rxcheqxier,  covering the Report of a Sub-Oommittof the Civil Service National Whitley Council dealing with threcruitment,  organisation and conditions of service in theCivil Service (Paper CP,-836).    The Committee consisted of11 officers of high standing in the Civil Service,  and,   onthe staff side,  of 13 representatives of Federations and Associations of Civil Servants,  and they had presented an agreedReport.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to two matterson which there was likely to be some controversy despite theagreement which had been reached by the Committee:    (1) the criticism that the Report did not go far enough in admittingthe principle of equal pay for equal work in the case of menand women, and (2) the proposal to recruit women within widerage limits than men, and by means of Selection Boards insteadof by written examination for a provisional period of fiveyears.With reference to the first objection,  the aoknowledg-ment of equal pay throughout the Civil Service might cost theState about  6i000,000 a year,  and would have far-reachingand expensive ramifications beyond the Service.With reference to the second criticism it was argued that, in the present stage of women&apos;s education, SelectionBoards were likely to discover more suitable women for thePublio Service than written examinations.    On the other hand,in view of pledges to give equal treatment, it would be difficult to defend the proposal in the House of Commons,  and the boards were strongly objected to by the Heads of the Women&apos;sColleges and the leading organisations of Women Workers.
A suggestion to use Selection Boards for the older,and written examinations for the younger, women candidatesk was rejected.In reaching their decision the Cabinet were impressed with the desirability of accepting without change the first and unanimous  Report of a National Whitley Council, which,it was hoped, would enjoy the confidence of,  and exercisevaluable influence throughout, the Civil Service.The Cabinet decided  -To approve the  Recommendations of theReport.PLCYMENT (7) The Cabinet had before them Memoranda by the MinisterPAHCEof Labour (Paper CP.-90S)  and the Minister of Health (paper cp.-910)*  dealing with the application of the UnemploymentInsurance Bill to Ireland, and the rate of unemploymentbenefit to women.icatiori (a)  It was explained that, whereas the new Unemploy-relahd.sent  Insurance Bill applied substantially to the wholeemployed population of Great Britain (except ,farm workers and domestic servants),  the application of the Bill inIreland was limited to the trades already insured under theNational Insurance (Unemployment) Acts,  1911 to 1919.    Thelinen trade,  for example, was excluded, and protests had beermade against such limitation by both Nationalist    andUnionist Members of Parliament.    The estimated annual costof extending the Bill was  2.00,000.    It was suggested thatthe imminent introduction of the Home Rule Bill made suchextension unnecessary,. and that in any case the administra-tion of the Act was likely to be bad.The Cabinet authorised  The Minister of Labour to arrange forthe extension of the Bill to Ireland.0e (b) The Cabinet were informed that,  during the proceedingn&apos;sid cement    In Committee,, an amendment had been moved which involvedfit&apos;.- &apos; .   ^       jrindirectly a proposal that the same weekly rate of benefit should be paid to unemployed women as to men, whereas the
Bill proposed &quot;15/- for men and 12-/- for women, these ratesbeing the same as those proposed in the amending Bill rela-t-in? to Health Insurance.    It was clear that the amendment had considerable support in the House,  and a decision upon ithad been postponed in order to ascertain the **iewa of theGovernment.    Members of the Committee held that women would readily pay the increased contribution required   from 2?td.to 3d. per week.    The cost to the State was estimated at abou 170,000, and somewhat higher if extended to Ireland.The Cabinet were reminded of the serious reactionthe proposal would have,  if adopted,  on the rates of sickness benefit under Health Insurance.    It would not be possible togive women who were ill less than women who were out of work,and to raise the sickness rate to 15/- would  require anincrease in the weekly contribution from 6d. to lOd. insteadof from 6d. to 9d.,  as proposed in the Bill;    and as therewould be opposition to increasing the women&apos;s contribution by double that proposed in the case of men,  the result mightbe to throw the whole burden (viz.,  950,000 per annum)  onthe Exchequer, in addition to the automatic increase in theState&apos;s normal contribution.There were also serious administrative objections toraisihq the rate of benefit for Health Insurance to domestic-servants, charwomen, etc., who would be outside the unemployment;ment scheme and among whom it would be difficult to cheekmalingering.The Cabinet authorised  The Minister of Labour to oppose the pro-posed amendment on behalf of the Government,and,  if it were still pressed, to throw theresponsibility upon the House of Commons.VISION OP (8) With reference to Cabinet 2 (19),  Conclusion 5, theV^ION TO     Cabinef had before them a Memorandum by the Minister ofA.BLPT) mm.Labour dealing with the extension of 0ut-of-&apos;7ork Donationto disabled men (Paper CP.-907).It was pointed out that the present provision of out-of-Work Donation to ex-Service men expires on March 31,
and that, in view of the. difficulty&apos; experienced by many inobtaining employment and of the shortage of training facili-$ ties..,  it was desirable,  at any rate in the case of the dis-abled, to continue the Donation for some months.    The date at which it  is proposed the Unemployment Insurance Pillshould come into operation is October 1, but it was prefer-able to terminate the Out-of-Work Donation in summer than att he beginning of wInt.er .The Cabinet decided -That the Out-of-work Donation to ex-Servicemen (disabled and non-disabled) should becontinued to the end of July, the maximumDonation to be drawn, under the extension to be limited to twelve weeks.?ING CP (9) The Cabinet had before them Conclusion 2 of HomeTHB RBNTARGE. Affairs Committee Minutes 49 (February 18,  1920), a Meraoran-dum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (paper CP.-572),a Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries(Paper CP.-884),  and a Draft Bill dealing with the  relief of ecclesiastical tithe rent charge..The Cabinet were agreed (a) &quot;fohat no case had been made out for extending relief to the tithe rent charge propertyof lay owners,  and (b) that  relief should be given to allecclesiastical tithe rent charge., who her attached to abenefice or to a capitular corporation..The Parliamentary Secretary to theMinistry of Agriculture  and Fisherieswas authorised to proceed with a Billon these lines.PRIS0I3MEKT (10) With reference to Cabinet 12 (19), Appendix IV (1),PIP&quot; FEINIP   the Secretary of State for Home Affairs called attention tohi A TP.the cases of hunger-striking at Wormwood Sorubbs, and askedfor the direction of the Cabinet as to whether any discriia-ination was to be made between prisoners convicted and prisoners unconvicted of political offences in their effotfto obtain release by hunger-striking.The Cabinet decided  That there should be no discrimination inthe treatment of the two classes of prisoners.
(ix) The Cabinet were informed that the El-eotjrioalUnion veire-^Mj^jfer^^ha--dlmaiesa3^crf-8L.-JLi.ft&apos; &quot;attendant whoduring the recent strike had remained at his post.The Cabinet authorised  The First Commissioner of  &apos;7orks to refuse the demand, and to call on the First Lordof the Admiralty for assistanoe from naval ratings should it be required.3, Whitehall Gardens, S.w.1,March 22, 1920.
