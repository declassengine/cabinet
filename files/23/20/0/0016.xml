POLICY       (2)&apos; The Minister of Transport made a statement to thefo WOOLWICH; :  .^ISEML. Cabinet on the lines of his Memorandum headed &quot;Building ofRailway Stock at Woolwich&quot; (Paper Cf.P.-92lK in the -courseof which he showed the impossibility of the economical-;; \^production at Woolwich of locomotives and railway rblling-stock. &apos;.. . .The Cabinet took note\..&apos;of the statement by the Minister of Transport.: It was pointed out, however, that this difficulty would arise whatever Depart-ment undertook responsibility for WoolwichArsenal,  and was part of the larger ques-t tion of future policy at the Arsenal,which would have to be considered bythe War Office in the near future.
JJBfOrO A MIA.,  .A^q-oith. was likely to ask for a statement by the-Govern: eMin Parliament on the sub^e^rt^d^u-ing^h^ week, theI)rtjiie-&quot;Uini^^r:-rai^ed, .aa a matter of&quot;urgency, the question,of the future of Mesopotamia.After the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had made a-comprehensive-statement&apos; of the present position asregards Mesopotamia and Kurdistan, the Cabinet took note of,  and approved, the following bases for any statement the Prime Minister might have to make on the subject:-(a) As regards the political status ofMesopotamia,  if Great Britain were offered a mandate by the Peace Con-ference, the Government&apos;s intentionto accept it:(b) The mandated territory must includeMosul,  since there is no suitablephysical boundary for Mesopotamia inthe plains between Mosul and thePersian Gulf;    since the inhabitantsobject to the partition of theircountry;    and since the oil-bearingregions of Mosul are essential to the revenues on which the future develop-ment of the whole country will depend:(c) The character of the mandate is setforth in Article 22 of the covenant of the League of Nations,   and itsprecise terms will shortly be decided by the Peace Conference,    The policyof the British Government is9 and willbe, to develop an Arab Government founded on representative Arab institutions(District and Provincial Councils,  etc.)and an Arab Administra* ion, with suchadministrative advice and assistance as may from time to time be foundnecessary:(d) The inhabitants of Mesopotamia, whenconsulted in 1918,  rejected the pro-posal that they should be given an arab ruler.    Should, however, theinhabitants change their opinion,the British Government woxxld not oppose their wishes.    They wouldhave no objection to the candidatureof a member of King Hussein&apos;s family,if acceptable to the inhabitants.ARRISCN (4)      T:tie Cabinet were agreed that a largel^c,;; &quot;m-      reduction in the size of the present&apos; garrison of Mesopotamia is urgently necessary.    They await with interest the proposals of the Secretary ofState for War and Air,  which they   .trust -may enable the garrison to be&quot; e d \ -. &apos; e d at a n e arly date.
r13&apos; R&apos; (5) mth.j^e e*enoe to Cabinet 11 (20), Appendix. II (2),..   the Secretary of Statue^^r^^i*ed^Jy^raiJ^e&apos; read to Mscolleagues the draft of a despatch to the netherlands government in reply to their refusal to hand over the kaiser in accordance with Article 227 of the Treaty ofPeace with Germany.    This draft, which Lord Curzon proposedto lay before the Council of Ambassadors and Foreign Minis-ters that afternoon, in substitution for a draft preparedby M, Berthelot, the Political Director of the French ForeignOffice, was intended to bring home to the Dutch Governmentthat, as they had chosen to act in opposition to the advice-of the Allies, the world would hold them responsible if theKai3er should escape.There was a short discussion, in the course of whichit was suggested that the Allies should formally place on record their intention to hold the Netherlands Governmentresponsible for any unfortunate consequences which mightensue from their action.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs was given full discretion to re-draft thedespatch to meet the views of his colleagues.TERENCE (6) The Cabinet took note of the Conclusions of a1?

RISH LANDufiCEASE.^VSRAQB GRAVITY     (X)    With refaraneo to Cabinet 1&apos;6 ( 0), Conclusion 8,Of 3S3R.the Conference had before them a Memorandum by theParliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Pood (PaperCPo-848) and a Memorandum by the President of the Board..-of Education (Paper C,?.-858)( calling attention to thedifficulties In which certain brewers of high gravitybeers found themselves when trying to adjust theiraverage to the permitted, individual average gravity of 10440,      Since the restriction on tho output       beerhad been abolished, the system of Transfer Certificatesarranged by the Ministry of Pood had disappeared, and unless the Government provided some way of escape the brewers were confronted with the necessity of brewinglar..e quantities of low-grade beer, which was unsaleable.The Ministry of Pood suggested that a system of pooling(a re-adjustment of the system which prevailed duringthe period of strict control) should be sanctioned, andit was stated for tho Liquor Control Board that thearrangement proposed did not appear to be a real infringe-ment of the undertaking which the Government had givento maintain restrictions pending the introduction ofthe Liquor Regulation Bill.      The proposed arrangement would not result in raising the strength of the beerbrewed by the high gravity brewers*The Conference decided  (a) To adopt a system of pooling, under whicha brewer of high gravity beer and a brewerof low gravity beer would pool their gravityin accordance with a licence to bo issued bythe Pood Controller, in order to secure thattho average gravity of the two brewers wouldnot exceed in the aggregate 1044oi(b)    That the above decision was not to be oon-strued as in any way departing from theright qf the Government to continue toregulate gravities.(2)    With reference to Cabinet IE (20), Conclusion 5, theConference had Before them a Memorandum by the Chief Seore-tary for Ireland (Paper CP.849) calling attention to the promise which^had. been given in the House of Commons tointroduce a Bill for tho completion of land purchase inTlTfil RRrl   a &quot;h   -then /--
O cr Qsame time -as the introduction of the Home Bule Bill. c* O OA suggestion wan made that the Land Purchase Billshould he based on the lines put forward by the Irish Con-vention, but the Conference agreed with the previous decisionof the Cabinet,  which limited the gift of annuities to 3,600,000.The Conference appointed the following committee to prepare a Draft Bill forgiving effect to the Cabinet&apos;s decision(Cabinet 12 (20),  Conclusion 5)i-The First Lord of the Admiralty (in the Chair),The Minister of Pensions,The Secretary of State for Home Affairs,The Chief Secretary for Ireland,The Law Officers of the Crown,Mr Pembroke Wicks (Secretary)..TI03J Aid)OF IN-AL citizen-(3) The Conference had before them correspondence whichhad passed between the Chancellor of the Exchequer andLord Sumner,   the Chairman of the London Reparation Commit-tee,  together with a Memorandum by Sir Warren Fisher,  thePermanent Secretary to the Treasury,  dealing with claims onaccount of losses suffered by private individuals in connec-tion with the War (Paper CP.-798).It was explained that,  in the opinion of Lord Sumner,the private individual had no claim directly on Germany for damage to civilian life and property caused by acts of war,but that the losses and sufferings of such individuals formed the subject-matter of a claim by the British Government as constituting a wrong to the State and not as private mattersor wrongs;  further,   individuals had no claim in law on theBritish Government for anything it might receive from germany in respect of such claims; anything granted by the Governmentto the sufferer would thus be entirely a matter of grace.It was pointed out that,  unless this view were maintained,  the Government would be involved in innumerablecomplications of a most embarrassing description.The Conference gave their general approval to thefollowing recommendations made by the Chancellor of theExchequer:- -2-
(a) Ho legal claim by private individualsagainst the repurcOJ.cn monies to beadmitted,  but any payments made to themto be as an act of grace on the part ofthe Government:(b) A lump sum of,  say,   5,000,000 to be set aside out of the first receipts of repara-tion monies allocated to the Exchequer ofthe United Kingdom (after payment of thecost of the Armies of Occupation) to create a fund out of which payments will be madeto individuals who have a moral claim to compensation.&apos;(c) A Commission to be appointed to examineclaims and to uake awards out of thin fund,proceeding on the basis of the strength ofthe claim rather than on the amount for whichit was admitted by the ile par at ion Commission.EBCI3E OP    (4)      The Conference had before them a memorandum by building-Tb III the Shipping Controller (CP.568) drawing attention toEASY.the right    of the allies under the leaee Treaty torequire Germany to build Merchant o!hips to an amountnot exceeding 200,OOCtons gross in each of the fiveyears after the Treaty comes into force.      The decisions with regard to the first two years was required b;y theTreaty to be notified to the German Government before april 10th 1920.      It was theiefore suggested that theBritish representative on the Reparation commission should be instructed to state that the British government proposes to exercise its share of these rights whichwould amount probably to 150,000 tons gross in each ofthe two years.      The vessels it was suggested should consist of Tankers.,  for vhich there was a great demand at present..Three guiding considerations emerged from thediscussion on the shipping Controller^ proposals:-Firstly the Conference were informed that theFrench press were conducting an unprecedentedly virulentcampaign against the United Kingdom on the ground thatthe Treaty \ as framed for the benefit
of this country and. directed against the interest ofFrance.      The particular ground of complaint in theFrench press was the division of German Shipping underthe treaty.      It would he most desirable that stopsshould be taken by the British Government tobring the true facts to the knowledge of the french people in order that the press campaign In france might be countered.secondly it was alleged that as the congestion in transport in this country was relieved ana conditionsbecame normal, there would be a surplus of shipping anda consequent collapse In shipbuilding.      While their ownyards were idle British Shipbuilders would see Germanyards busily engaged, not only in reconstructirg theGerman iiiavy and the German Mercantile Marine but(if the present proposals were adopted) in buildingships at the order    of the British Government,,      this could not but oreate a very bitter feeling.Thirdly it appeared to be doubtful wwhether a cash payment would not have to be made to theReparation Commission for the value of the ships.
In thie TonncKTtjLoii uhe OerniVrenoe were informedthat, the British representation/e  on the Reparation Commission&quot;had been consulted on the question whether,  if germany were required to build ships for the United Kingdom underthe  Peace Treaty,   this  country would be liable to pay theircash value to the. Reparation Commission;    and he had repliedthat, while the United Kingdom was becoming liable to thereparation pool fo^1 a very considerable immediate sum inrespect of our share of the existing German tonnage, the deliveries in kind to the  other lowers seemed likely to fallvery seriously behind what was contemplated by the Treaty.It was probable, therefore, that,  on an early balance struckfor the purpose of Article  37 of the Treaty, the UnitedKingdom would be^ somewhat heavy-debtor   and might-find&apos; itdifficult to avoid having to provide cash for the cost  or armies of Occupation and approved supplies of food and raw &apos;materials,  and for the Belgian priority payments,  if the cash assets of the reparation fund proved to bo insufficient to cover these prior charges.    There was little doubt thatthe United Kingdom would,   for the time being, have to take its chare  of the coot of Armies of Occupation in the formof ships;    and if new ships as well as existing ships were taken we should probably put ourselves in the position ofdebtors  to the reparation fund over and above the amount ofour credit in respect  of our own Armie-s^of Occupation,  andwould  run considerable risk of having to pay the value ofthe new chips in cash to provide money for the other allied armies of Occupation,   for food supplies and raw materials,and for the Belgian priority.As regards tho  camuai-n in the &quot;French Press,  it wascrated that the French, were always difficult tc  satisfy.
Moreover,  if the United Kingdom did not assert  its elaim2b2in this particular instance, the other Allies would doubtlessclaim the whole 200,000 tons of shipping involved each year;C and if we were eventually to forego our just claims in anyway in favour of the French it would be preferable to do soin a manner which would reflect on us the greatest possibleoredit, and not merely to allow our claims to lapse byreason of their not being pressed.As regards the shipbuilding position in this country,while  in five years&apos; time it might well be that British yardswould not have enough orders, those yards were generally fullup with orders for the next two years at least,  and at themoment it was only proposed that the  claim to the GermanGovernment should be made for a period of two years and thatthe Germans should be required to build oil tonnage, whiohwas extremely scarce and the value of which at the moment was about  60 a ton.The Conference accordingly agreed:-(a) That the British representative on the ReparationCommission should be informed by the Treasury thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government  intended to exercise their share of the rights under the Peace Treaty to requireGermany to build merchant  ships to an amount notexceeding 200,000 tons gross in eaoh of the two yearssucceeding April 10,  1920:(b) That while the claims of His Majesty&apos;s Government inthis respeat should be stated,  steps should not betaken actively to enforce it, but that it should beheld in reserve as a bargaining factor:( e) That the Shipping Controller should prepare, with aview to publication inn the press, a statement show&quot;ing the actual situation in regard to the divisionof German shipping amongst the Allies.(Note: This statement appeared in the &quot;Daily Telegraphon the 17th March,  1920).FUTURE OP (5)    With reference to Conclusion 4 of a Conference held the MINISTRYOP MUNITIONS.on December 9,  1919. the Conference had under consideration a Memorandum by the Minister of Munitions on the Future of woolwich Arsenal (Paper CP. 372),  and Memoranda by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty (Paper C.P.616),  the Secretaryof State for War (Paper C.P.  65?),  the Seoretary of State
for Air (Paper CP.-764), together with a Memorandum by the deputy Minister of Munitions (Paper CP.-8ID)  regarding$ $bXM^E? tff r lH$ttefn8,1..Mg^ndum by the First Corn-It was explained to the Conference that,  in accord-ance with the decision of the Cabinet Conference on December9th.  the Fighting Departments had furnished to the Ministerof Munitions lists of articles which might be the subjectof common purchase and manufacture..    The Fighting Depart-ments, however, had come to the conclusion that it wouldbe better to create a Joint Committee to regulate government purchases,  since stocks would lia*re to be held by the usingDepartments,  and this would involve a duplication both ofclocks and of inspectorate.    It was urged that during atime of peace the existence of a Ministry of Supply was unnecessary, although it was admitted that such a ministry was essential  during a great war,in order to preventcompetition between Departments for material and labour.Moreover, in the case of the Navy, questions of disciplinewere involved,  and no Board of Admiralty would;  it war.alleged, be responsible for naval discipline  if theywere not also charged with the responsibility for the inspection and loading on board ship of articles such, asexplosives..On the other hand it was urged that the experienceof the War had shewn that a Committee would be an ineffect-Ive method of co-ordinating the activities of the War-Departments.    The pre-war  system meant a duplication ofmachinery,  and during the War, before the creation ofthe Ministry of Munitions, the same factories wereinspected by officials  of the Admiralty and the WarOffice.    There were many instances of competition betweenthe Admiralty and the War Office in the same factory.The result was the raising of prices and duplication of inspection and of ordinary staff.    It was quite possibleto provide for special brands of explosives,  as had been
done in the case of the spe-cial.-co.rufte roq-udred by theAdmiralty for warships.    One great advantage of central control of purchase was that it enabled a scientific costsystem to be created, which would result, in an enormoussaving,It was pointed out to the Conference that a compromisewould be no settlement of the question, and that a decision was required between the  old system and the system adoptedduring the War,  which united the purchases of the FightingDepartments under the control of one Office.    If there wasto bo a Ministry of Supply,  all the benefits accruing fromits establishment would be lest unless the ordering of everyhind of article required by the Fighting Departments  except those  required for purely experimental purposes  was transferred to it.The case  of Woolwich Arsenal was referred to as being an extreme instance of the necessity of co-ordination between.the Fighting Departments.    It had been impossible to take any steps to improve the situation at Woolwich because many of01 the Arsenalthe Departments. were not under the control of the Ministry ofMunitions but  still remained with the Admiralty or the WarOffice.    Thus., in the same plaoef there were five founders&apos;shops,  three blacksmiths&apos;  shops,  four -printing - establishments,etc.    Some solution of the difficulties at Woolwich was urgently required in order to prevent - repetition of thescenes which occurred when the 10,000 men discharged frsmWoolwich recently visited London.^ne Conference accordingly decided  (a) That the First Commissioner of Works andPublic Buildings should,  as soon as pos-sible, convene a Conference of representa-tives of the three Service Departments,the Ministry of Munitions and the Treasury,with a view&quot;to formulating a scheme for thefuture management  of Woolwich Arsenal (onthe assumption that a Ministry of supply would not necessarily be created),  theproposals of the Conference to be consideredby a further Cabinet Conference to be heldon Tuesday, March S3,  1930:(b) That the general question of the creationof a Ministry of Supply should be re-considered
when the proposals of the Conferencein re-gar-d&apos; to the pairtaorular osce oftfoulwich (referred to in (a)  above)were before the  Cabinet Conference..2^, Whitehall Gardens,  S..W.1,March 16,   1920.
