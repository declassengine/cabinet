tAC!S&apos; ,S (1)  7mh referenoe to Paper I.0.P.-S2. Minute 1,  the!R. .,, Cabinet had under consideration the following telegrams fromthe British Ambassador in Paris,  relating to the list ofpersons accused of breaches of the laws of war, to be demand-ed from the German Government under Articles 228 to 23C ofthe Treaty of Versailles:-Nod.  133,  134,  135 and 136, all of   -February 4,  192.0.The position disclosed in these telegrams and in thediscussion may be summarised as follows:-In the execution of Articles 228 to 230 of theTreaty of Versailles,  and in conformity with paragraph 3 of the Protocol of June 28,   1919,M. Millerand, in his capacity as President ofthe Ambassadorrs Conference,  had transmittedin the name of the Allied Powers on February 3rdto Baron von Lersner,  President of the German peace Delegation,  a copy of the lists of accusedpersons drawn up by the British,  French,  Italian,Belgian,  Polish,  Roumanian and Serb-Croat-SloveneGovernments.    These lists were accompanied by aletter in which it was stated that --&quot;A further communication would state in reply to Note No.88 of the Presi-&apos; dent of the German Peace Delegation,the conditions in which the AlliedPowers intended to have the provisionsof the Treaty of Peace on this subjectcarried, out,&quot;, Baron von Lersner had replied to this letterby a note in which he recalled that during thepast three months he had repeatedly explained to the representatives of the Allied and Asso-ciated Powers, both verbally and in writingand in the most sincere manner, the reasonsthat made it impossible for Germany to complywith this demand, whatever the position of the accused might be, and whatever name they mightbear.    He recalled that he had repeatedly statedthat not a single German official could be foundto co-operate in any manner in executing therequest for surrender.    Ad he would be co-operating in the execution of that demand wore he to under-take to transmit te. Millerand&apos;s note to the GermanGovernment^  he therefore returned it.       Baron .vonLersner had concluded by stating that he had in-formed the German Government that he could not continue to fulfil his functions,  and would leave Paris by the first train.&apos;The Ambassadors&apos;  Conference was now proposing to communicate the list direct to the GermanGovernment instead of through, the German PeaceDelegation in Paris;    They proposed to accompanythis &apos; communication with a Note in which,  afterrehearsing the above circumstances,  they would
add that the Powers were unwilling to considerBaron von Lersner&apos;s action otherwise than asa purely personal one which did not involvethe responsibility of the German Government,and that they were unable to believe that thelatter intended to *vade the obligations assumed in signing the Treaty of Versailles and that less than a month after the coding into forceof the Treaty they were refusing deliberatelyto execute one of its essential&apos;provisions.The question was represented as one of great urgency,  as under Clause 3 of the Protocol of&apos;June 28th. the list must be delivered to the&quot;German Government within a month of the exchequer-ing into force of the Treaty,  that  is to say,before February loth. ,   or else ou** riqht to&quot;claim the war criminals would lapse.Press reports having been received in Fncclandto the effect that the French and Belgian listsincluded a number of highly-placed persons inGermany, among who:./, were von Pethmann-Kol 1 weg,Marshal Hindenburg, Marshal Palkenhayn andother persons whose apprehension and deliveryfor trial would not only be very difficult tothe German Government but also, hardly appearedto fall within tho scope of Article 228* of theTreaty of Versailles,  tho Prime Minister hadtaken the responsibility of telephoning, on theprevious evening to the British Ambassador inParis asking him to stop the despatch of the list to Berlin until the British Cabinet had considered the question.In the course of the  discussion it transpired thatthe final lists of accused persons prepared by the variousAllied Governments had not been communicated to the BritishGovernment,    As the result of the recent Conferences in Londonand in Paris,  all the lists had been out down proportionately,and on a common basis.    Each list, however, had been preparedafter an exhaustive analysis of great -asses of evidence, andthe representatives of the several States concerned had notthe material to criticise the lists prepared by States  otherthan their own.    Consequently it was not definitely known whether the French and Belgian lists did contain the highly-placed persons referred to in the Press.    If their names wer

As the result of the recent Conferences in London,and in Paris,  all the lists had been cut down proportionately,and on a common basis.    Each list, however, had been preparedafter an exhaustive analysis of great masses of evidence, andthe  representatives of the  several  States concerned had notthe material to criticise the lists prepared by States otherthan their own.    Consequently it was not definitely known whether the French and Belgian lists did contain the highly-placed persons  referred to in the Press.    If their names were
Unalu**rt.  *.* i^wm^^ tfW ****** a .^&amp;n thmi(, ,^2had been held to justify the inclusion in the British 1.1 Vtof persons such as von Tirpita and von Capelle, who were-esoonsible for initiating the unlimited submarine warfare/After a full discussion,  the Cabinet reached thefollowing Conclusions(a) That,  in accordance with the advice cfthe Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General,  it was probable that the presen-tat ion to Baron von Lersner of the&apos;listof criminals  on February 3rd. oomoliedwith the requirements of the Protocol ofJune 28th,  and that this presentationwas not invalidated by Baron von Lersner&apos;refusal to accept the list,, nor by any subsequent reduction which might be made- in the list.    Consequently,  the dateFebruary 10th, alluded to&quot;above, had nolonger any special significance..Nevertheless it was desirable to proceedwith the scatter as rapidly as possible:(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should telephone immediately to paris in the following sense:- r&quot;The Cabinet have heard this morningfor the first  time with much surprisethat the list of criminals to besubmitted to the German Government bythe Allies   for which we are expectedto assume our  share of responsibility  is composed on lines which seem toinfringe the main principle upon whichwe agreed with M. Clemenceau in Londonand which has been the basis of our action up to date.    That principle wasthat the surrender should be demandedof persons who were accused of criminalacts or acts in violation of the laws or customs of war   not of persons whoseresponsibility was either political orsecondary.      We cannot  support thiscollective list without knowing theevidence upon which the case is based.We are accordingly sending over an-airman at once,  and shall be glad ifyou will procure and sent to him a copyof the complete list to the Buc aerodromebefore 3 p.m, today,  In order to enable him to return before dark.    Not  a momentshould be lost.      The Lord Chancellor andthe Attorney-General will cross to Paristonight with our considered views&quot;.(c) That the Secretary of State for War should arrange for the immediate despatch of theaeroplane referred to in (b): r(d) That the Prime Minister&apos;s Private Secretary(Mr J.T.Dsvies)  should arrange for thepassage of the Lord Chancellor and the attorney-General by the Havre boat, andfor a special train to meet them at Havre,in order that they might reach Paris earlyor, th&apos;-  following day:  9Effect was given to these -decisions during the Meeting.
(e)That the Lord Chancellor and the attorney general should have authority to cut down the British list of persons to be demandedas provided for below, in (f):(f) That a Committee,  composed as follows:-The Lord President of the  Council(in the Chair),The Lord Chancellor,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,The Secretary of State for &apos;?ar,The First Lord of the Admiralty,The Attorney-General,The Solicitor-General,with such Naval,  Military and Airexperts as might be required,Colonel L.  Storr (Secretary),should meet at 2-45 p.m,  on the same day, with full-power to decide whatcurtailments could be made in theBritish list
ER, (2) With, reference to Paper I,C,,..P,-17, ,Minute 1, theCabinet had under^on^ri^eraixum the question of the attitude to be taken up in view of the refusal of the netherlands government to hand over the Kaiser for trial.    In this con-no ct ion they had before them a despatch from the british ambassador in Paris,  covering M,  01emenoeauvs Note ofJanuary 15, 1920,  to the Netherlands Government, togetherwith the reply of the Netherlands Government  dated January  1,1920 (?.C.  173,494) .After a full discussion of the various alternative courses open,  and having regard on the one hand to the inoxpe-diency of over-riding (particularly in the case of a smallState such as Holland) the claim to the right of asylum, andon the other hand to the  risk of leaving the Kaiser within ashort distance of the German frontier, the Cabinet agreed r-(a) That the most satisfactory solution would balfour the Netherlands Government were to offer to intern the Kaiser safely in distantPossessions, such-as the Netherlands BastIndies, which was one of the suggestionson which the Netherlands Foreign minister had  sounded the British Minister at theHague .      In such a contingency the Alliesought to consider the matter favourably,The proposal, however, must emanate fromthe Netherlands Government:(b) That the next step was  for the Allies to renew their demand to the netherlands government,  insisting cn their rights underthe Treaty of Versailles,  and toakxno itclear that they could hot tolerate the reteh-tion of the Kaiser within an hour or two5 sjourney of the German frontier:(o) That if our Allies should assent to thecourse proposed in (a),  a hint might begiven to the Netherlands Government,thr ough diplomatic channeIs:(il That the Lord Chancellor should be authorised:,while in Paris, to discuss this quesiion^wxththe French Government,  on behalf of the Cabinet:(p) That the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should communicate the necessary documents tothe Lord Chancellor before his aeparxure.
