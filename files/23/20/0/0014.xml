On the other hand, it waspointed out that the House of Commons had been officiallytold that the equivalent price of 76/-,  fixed in 1918, wastoday 95/-.(a) The Cabinet authorised the parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Agricultureand Fisheries to announce a wheat priceof 95/- per quarter for the 1920 crop,  the exact  form of the announcement to be agreed with Mr Fisher by Sir A.  Griffith-Boscawenand Lord Crawford.NOTE.    The following announcement wasagreed upon:-&quot;In order to remove the anxiety which hasbeen expressed by farmers with regard tothe price of the 1920 wheat crop, theGovernment lias decided that so long aswheat is still controlled arid therebydeprived of a free market, the controlledprice of home-grown wheat of sound millingquality harvested in 1920 shall be the monthly average  (c,i.f.)  price of imported wheat of similar or comparable quality,provided that the price so paid to thehome grower shall not exceed 95/- per quarter of 504 lbs.&quot;(b) The Cabinet decided that the price ofoffals should be put up to a parity withother feeding-stuffs, the figure to beagreed by the wheat Commission and theMinistry of Asriculttire and Fisheries.0NS.(2) With reference to War Cabinet 591, Minute 3,  and cabinet 11 (20), Appendix I (9), the Cabinet had before the:^Memoranda by the Chancel], or of the Exchequer (Papers C.P.-617 and 832)  uixd&apos; a Memorandum by the Secretary of State fa-war (Paper 0 ,P*- -606). dealing with the question of bringing
1 1 i ; &apos; li 238pre-&apos;wajr-jpenaA/ui^^ and civil, up to thepost-war standard.    The-JJ?^eaH r^^charge on the Exchequer at about  7,000,000,  and the totalcost -wcoihd^repr^e-errt ^n-dramediato--capital sum of  50,000,000at least.    To these sums would possibly fall to be addedsubsidies to cover railway servants and Local Authorities.The Treasury were not in,favour of the increases beinggranted, but if it were considered expedient for somerelief to be afforded as a compassionate measure,  theTreasury urged that it should be confined to pensionersproved to be in real distress which it was beyond their ownpowers  reasonably to alleviate.The Cabinet were reminded that the matter had been raised in the House of Commons in connection with pensions to ex-police officers, when very strong feeling had been shown and a vote had been carried against the Government of123 against 57,  and when the Home Secretary had found himself compelled to undertake to enquire into the questionof hard cases (Parliamentary Debates, February 25, 1920,page 1836). It was impossible to ignore such a resolution on the part of the House,  and in any case a promise to investigate hard cases had been made.    There was, however,no doubt that considerable misapprehension prevailed as tothe basis of the pensions granted by the State.    It waspopularly thought that they implied an undertaking on thepart  of the State to enable persons to maintain a certainstandard of living, whereas in fact they were based on thenumber of years&apos;  service and the scale of salary on retire-ment.    A high proportion of the pensioners retired at an age when they were well able to supplement their pensionsby earnings.    Further, there were a large number of servants of the State,  e.g., in dockyards and arsenal s* who werenot pensioned at all5 and who might therefore be held to b-less fortunate and more deserving in present circumstancesthan the pensioners.    The State pensioners, it was argued,
did -not- erui?^rr^y--i^a^or^ &quot;bo-the &apos;State, but were only one group of a general class whosenoymal standard of life had been upset by fiscal changesdue to the War..It was pointed out that proposals to raise the pre-war pensions to posh-war levels had been more than oncerejected by the Cabinet., and on the ground of their deci-8ions the Chancellor -of the Exchequer load eategoricallyresisted any increase in the House of Commons.    It would weaken his power of resistance to fresh expenditure if theCabinet now reversed its former decisions.On the other hand,  it was contended that not only did the recent vote of the House of Commons modify the Parlia-mentary position of the matter and absolve the Chancellorof the Exchequer, but it was held that the proposed increaseinwas -itself just as well as expedient, that it was,indeed,implied in the contract of service under the State that the pensioners would not be deprived of effective power tosecure a certain minimum standard of life.    At present manyof them were confronted with severe hardship.    At least itwas the duty o^ the State not to fall below the practiceof a good employer.Various methods of dealing with the case were reviewede.g., an age limit of 60,  with or without regard to infirmityin earlier ages;    a flat addition to present pensions;    o-a graduated scale;    and emphasis was laid on the possiblereaction of any plan adopted on Old Age Pensions and onthe Civil Service, where grievances were acute.    The costat post-war rates from 60 years of age was roughly estimatedat  4,750,000.The Cabinet were generally agreed that some steps were necessary to deal with cases above 60 years of age,and decided  (a) That the Prime Minister should give thefollowing answer to a Question in theHouse of Commons that afternoon:-
L?A R? OFV t^J TMT) .&quot;The Government, have again carefully considered this subtect,  and cannotdepart from the decision already an-nounoed that, having regard to thevery heavy expenditure due to theWar,  it would be most unjust to thegeneral taxpayer to raise the pre-warpensions in accordance with the pres-ent scale.    We have, however,  appoint-ed a Committee to consider whether any steps can be taken to relieve excep-tional oases of hardship due,  for ex-ample, to age and infirmity,  but theHouse must realise how great are thedifficulties in dealingwith thissubject&quot; .(b) That the precise form of dealing with thesubject should be referred for considera-tion and report to the following Committee:-Sir L. Worthington-Evans (Chairman),Mr Shortt,Mr H.A.L.Fisher,Sir A. Williamson (War Office),A Representative of the Board of Admiralty,A Representative of the Treasury,Mr F.W.Leith Ross (Secretary) .(The Chancellor of the Exchequer acceptedthe decision of the Cabinet, though hewas unable to approve it.)(The Secretary of State for War expressed his dissent from the decision,  on theground that, in his opinion, it did not go far enough to meet the deserts of thepre-war pensioners.)(3) With reference to War Cabinet 579, Minute 5, theCabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Minister ofHealth (Paper CP.-817)  dealing with the need for making further provision for the welfare of the blind.    The matte-was urgent, as the Labour Party were promoting a Bill onthe following day in the House  of Commons, and were o-gan-isinft an agitation amongst the blind population and theirsympathisers.    Mr Hayes Fisher, when President of the LocaGovernment Board, had given certain pledges on behalf ofthe Government,  to the effect that the State was going todo for the blind what it  ought to have done many years ageit was going to make special provision for them;    it was going to see that there was some supervision of their general education and general maintenance (Parliament a-Debates, May S,   1918,  page 1745).
- The &quot;Minister of Health,  in his .MeroorajrduiGf; suggestedthat oowers shoul^b^-o^yt^djie^-enab-lJjig- County and CountyBorough Councils, and possibly some other bodies, to provideand maintain,  or contribute towards the provision andmaintenance of, workshops, -hostels and hor.es,  and other places, for &quot;the reception of the blind.    In conjunction withsuch legislation it&apos;was further suggested that grants in aid should be given in respect of the capital expenditure of theabove Local Authorities in making such provision.    It wasnot anticipated that the amount cf the grant would exceed 2.50,000,spread over a considerable number of years,  and itwas believed that in respect of the ensuing financial year the sum of  25,000 would be sufficient.    It was also suggest-ed that for the unemployable blind   a class formingapproximately 46 per cent, of the total   the most suitable form of assistance would be a weekly cash allowance to persons between the ages of 50 and 70,    For this purpose the organisation used for Old Age Pensions would be avail-able.The Cabinet authorised the Minister ofHealth,  wh/xle rejecting the Bill of theLab o u r Pa ,-ty, to promise legisl at ionbroadly on the lines of his Memorandum.a, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,March 11,  1920. .    .
