This promise hadbeen based on the following cabinet decision:-&quot;The Prime Minister should be authorised&apos;to state to the Deputation that the policyof the Government would be to safeguardtenant farmers from capricious evictionin the event of sale or notice for raisingrents.    In case of dispute as to the latter,the matter to be settled by arbitration&quot;(War Cabinet 632, Minute 4, October 20,1919.)It was agreed that the wording of this passage,in order to carry out the Prime Minister&apos;undertaking without liability of misunderstand-ing, should be left to the Drafting Committee.(k) It was agreed to leave in the draft the reference to a Water Power Bill.(1) The following passage in the final sentencecame in for some criticism:-&quot;Proposals will also be laid before youduring the present Session dealing withthe reform of the Second Chamber, thoughit is not expected, in view of the mass of urgent legislation which you will becalled upon to consider, that time will permit of their being passed into law&apos;.It was recalled that the Prime Minister haddefinitely undertaken to deal with the reform
of the Sec-end Chiucbe-r--in the seoond Session^;0f.;thi^&apos;-JParLi4ua8&apos;Trt, and it w%s accordinglyagreed to leave in the drs/ftr a referenceto.this subject.   The suggestion to statedefinitely that it was not expected that. time would permit of these proposals beingpassed into law,  however, did not commend itself to the Cabinet, and it was agreed.to substitute the following:-&apos; &quot;and it is hoped that time will permit. of. their being passed into law&quot;.(ro) On the ground thai the subject had never. been discussed&apos; by the Cabinet,  the fbllow-ing sentence was deleted:-&quot;The Report of the Devolution Committeeis anxiously awaited, and should itprove favourable to the idea, immediate steps will be taken to prepare the legis-lation necessary to give effect to itsre c omraend at 1ons *t(n) The Cabinet were Reminded that the present arrangement in regard to the control of therailways would expire within less than twoyears, and it was generally recognisedthat a Transport Bill would be required inthe near future.    It Was pointed out * however,that its mention in the King&apos;s Speech was not essential to the introduction of a Bill inParliament, and in view of the heavy legisla-tive programme to which the Government are committed, it was coneideredAiser not to mention the Transport Bill in the King&apos;a speech.(o) The deletion of the reference to legislation for improving the milk supply of the country,already referred- to above, was based on similssgrounds.
11 &quot;    81Tj$E IRISH (3) With reference to Cab^jieV-S/i^l^X-^App^ MinuteEDUCATIONBILL. 5^ wmaJuteriz&amp;lj&amp;^^^ oh place, during the consideration-tion of the Draft of the King&apos;s Speech, on the subject of     &quot;the Irish Education Bill and ag to the expediency of intro-ducing it in the same Session as the Government of Ireland&apos;Bill,    It was recognised that the introduction of the IrishEducation Bill would be represented as an indication thatthe Government did not intend to push through the Governmentof Ireland Bill.     It was pointed cut, however, that theIrish Education Bill implemented an obligation on theGovernment to grant to Ireland an equivalent sum fer educa-tion as to England, and was already overdue;    that in the moatfavourable circumstances the Government of Ireland bill could not be put in operation during the present year, andthat during their first year the Irish Legislatures might notbe able to devote their attention to Irish education;    and,finally, that, pending the passage of this Bill,the educa-tional facilities in Ireland are totally Insufficient.    Inthese circumstances it was agreed  That the Irish Education Bill should beintroduced in the forthcoming Session,but that it should be adjusted so as to conform to the Government of Ireland Bill.-6-
I   , 82gSS 0F       (4) **4uwf*^^ * (SO), Conclusions theliSg.. Cabinet had before them the r^crwij^Axysaj^nta relating to&quot;the de-control of home-grown meat:-Home Affairs Committee 47th Meeting, Minute 1:Letters from the National Farmers Unionsof England and Scotland (Paoers C,?,-522 and 504);A. Memorandum by the Seoretary for- Scotland(Paper C.P.-53G);A Memorandum by the Chief Secretary for ireland (Paper C.P.-548).It was generally agreed that, while de-control of meetwas desirable, it was eaaential that the undertakings givenby the British Government to the farmers of the United Kingdommust be adhered to.   Although no guarantee had been given bythe Government to purchase all meat brought to market, the farmers had undoubtedly assumed that the Government hadincurred an obligation in this respect.A suggestion that these undertakings applied necessar-lly to the United Kingdom as a unit and would be broken ifonlycontrol was removed in England/ was not generally accepted.It was generally agreed that the resolutions passedby the National Farmers&apos; Union of England and by the RoyalAgricultural Society in favour of de-control, would justifythe Government in removing control in England, notwithstanding the objections of Some individual farmers.    It was equallyrecognised that, in view of the opposition of the national farmers&apos; Union of Scotland and of the Irish farmers, meatcould not be de-controlled in those countries.It was pointed out that the probable result of removingcontrol in England would be a fall in the price of the cheapergrades of meat and a rise in the price of the higher grades.It was recognised that a loss would be involved by the purehasof the cheaper grades of meat at the controlled price inScotland and by the necessity of its sale at the market price,in England (since there is not a sufficient market inScotland for more than a fraction of the produce).
It va^sug^rted^hove^^ be partiallyrecouped by the eale at high prices of the higher grades of Scottish meat, which would also be purchased at the con-trolled price.    It was realised that a loss would in any case be involved in the purchase of Irish meat, which Is almostentirely of the. lower&quot; grades.    It was felt, however, thatthere was no necessity for the British Government, who hadincurred.no obligation in this respeot, to purchase largequantities ef I&quot;Ish meat.It was. pointed out that the officials of the Ministryof Food regarded the proposal to remove the control in Englandbut not in Scotland as administratively impossiblee since thede-control in Englahd would involve the suppression of thewhole of the Department devoted to meat control in England,which had dealt hitherto with the sales not only of English-produced meat but also of a large proportion of the scottish and Irish production.    It was suggested that this difficultymight be surmounted by retaining a portion of the Departmentto deal with the sales in England of Soottiah and Xrisu**produced meat.After- a prolonged discussion the Cabinet agreed -(&amp;,) that if administratively feasible, meatshould be de-controlled in England, butthat the control should be retained InScotland Ireland:(b) That the Pood Controller should confer withthe Ministry of Pood officials and report asto whether the above proposal was administra-tively feasible, and more particularly as towhether it could be rendered so by the retention-tlon in the Meat Control Department of theMinistry of sufficient staff to deal in Englandwith the sale of meat purchased in Scotland.
It was urged that, in view of the recent decisionto set up a Committee on Disability Pensions (finance committee, 18thMeeting, Minute 1), and in view of theintention to introduce legislation for transferringDisability Pensions questions relating to the Peace Armyfrom the Ministry of Pensions to the Service Departments,it was undesirable to take &amp; final decision on this ques-tion at this stage.The Minister of Pensions stated that the question was urgent,  in view df the refusal of the Treasury toexercise their power.&amp;f granting suitable pensions underthe Dispensing &quot;Warrant.    He would be prepared to withdraw his proposals if the Treasury would undertake to deal withthe small number of outstanding cases, which ought not inthe aggregate to exceed fifty.The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to have the question examined in theTreasury, and it was left for settlement between the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Minister of Pensions.\RELIEF 0?

Millerand, the French Presidentgf the Council, in regard to the future of the Peace Ccn-ference.    He had explained to M, Millerand that it would beimpossible for British Ministers, who had spent so long atime in Paris during the previous year, to remain thereagain for more or leas prolonged periods for the purposeof discussing the terms of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey,M, Millerand had replied by a refusal to hold mere than a preliminary Conference on principles in London, and had insisted that the Turkish Treaty must be completed in Paris.The Prime Minister had then felt constrained to reply veryfirmly, and the result had been a telephone message that very morning from the French Government asking when it wouldb$ convenient to the British Government for the conference to assemble in London,Before this Conference assembled, he wished to confer with his colleagues on the subject of the treatment ofpersons accused of breaches of the laws of war, and the kaiser,CONFERENCESOP MINISTERS,(9) The Cabinet took note of the Conclusions of thefollowing Conferences of MinistersConference of Ministers held on January S3,1920, at 3-15 p.m,  (Appendix IX):Conference of Ministers held on January 27,1920, at 11-30 a.m, (Appendix III):&apos;:Conference of Ministers held on January 27,1920, at 5 p,ra, (Appendix XV).*  .  . *2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,February 4, 1920.

v The Ooftf&amp;rence met in -ao^xordaiace-.- with the instxuo-ti-ons- ofthe &quot;Cabinet (Cabinet-B/EO) Minute 5, to-^c^onaider and settle two matters arising out of the proposals of the Ministry of health for the amendment of the scheme of National Health Insurancecontained in a memorandum by the Ministry of Health (CP.858 3,which had already been coneidered by a previous Committee and indefault of agreement had been referred back to the Cabinet(Reference H.I.C. 2nd Minutes 2 &amp; 3),(a) The first question was whether the cost of increase in cash benefits under the Health Insurance Acta, proposed bythe Ministry of Health should be apportioned between theExchequer, Employers and. lirqployod in the same proportion as the existing benefits or whether a further Id, shouldbe added to the workmen^ contribution In-addition tothe increase in that contribution already proposed; therebyrelieving the Exchequer of any increased expenditure.(b) The second question was whether the rate of remuneration todoctors should be raised from an average of 8/9 per patientto 10/- as proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, orto 11/- $s proposed by the Ministry -of. Health.ISCHBJiSE   1*     With regard to the cuestion of the Id. increase in the con-CONxHIHKIIOJJ BY    &quot;ti?tfexrtion for sickness benefit it was pointed out that for thePERSOfiS.   purpose of replying to comparisons with the Unemployment Insurancescheme it could be stated that the original proportion of go n-tributions by the Exchequer, Employer and Employed had been settled at a rate at which it was thought proper to launch the HealthInsurance scheme, without any pledge that if the insured desiredto increase their benefits the State should continue to contributein the same proportion in respect of the increased benefits.    Onthe other hand it was pointed out that the minimum benefit of 15/-per week with which tho Unemployment Insurance scheme was beingstarted was the same amount as the maximum benefit to which it was now proposed to increase Health Insurance^ and on that basis the health Insurance contribution was comparable with the UnemploymentInsurance contribution.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that he was preparedby way of compromise to give way on this point if a satisfactory agreement could be come to with regard to the payment of doctors.-It-
s.     It was pointed, out that the rate of rerauneratXon of doctors was not hound up with the principle of the that the doctors claims were not viewed with any morefavour by the Approved Societies than by the Chancellorof the Sxc*A^quer*     The doctors were being paid &amp;/9d, perpatient exclusive of drugs and mileage allowance, which werenot in^dispute?     They w*re claming 13/6*     The MinistiHf ofHealth proposed that they should have 11/** whish he desiredto reduce &quot;to XO/V?     The State, in addition, tc its generalcontribution and its share of the doctorsr spsimmeration,was also proposing to relieve the Societies-of the ggmato rium.contribution, which would amount to a relief of  5-50,000per annum.     It v-as suggested that, having regard to this,the iSxchaquer should be relieved by the Societies of any share in the increased payment to.doctors.On the other hand,  It was pointed out that tfcs Ministryof Health were very dissatisfied with the service given by many of the? doctors, and that with a view to improving thequality of the service they had agreed with the Treasuryduring the war (1) that the scale of doctors8 remunerationshould be revised after the war, the bonus given in themeantime being merely regarded as a temporary expedient;(2) that stringent regulations should be drawn up tosecure more efficient service.     This vies now being done.*One of the most; important conditions to be imposed was to limit the number of patients per1 doctor-.     75 per cent, ofthe do ctors now on the panels received less than  500 a year from Insurance JPunds, the number of doctors having severalthousands of patients on their lists being few in number0It was proposed to limit the number of patients to 3,000 perpanels and some authorities were reducing it to 2,000o     Ithad only been possible with great difficulty, tc induce theStatutory
Statutory- Committee of Doctors to agree to the new regulations-     In addition to.this, it was.proposed towithdraw the allowance of  80,000 hitherto granted by theMinistry of Pensions for extra attendance on demobilisedsoldiers.     Again, nearly  250,000 had gone to the Societiesexit of the Pensions Puna on account of extra, war risks.This was a declining amount which would terminate in the. course of the current year.     Therefore, there would baaltogether a relief between  300,000 and  350,000 to thePensions &quot;Vote,     The regulations with regard to medical service had been so strictly drawn up that unless it waspossible to offer such conditions of service as wouMsatisfy a reasonable man, the Ministry of Health would be faced with a discontented profession.     For emaple, doctorsdesired to be allowed to retain the privilege of sellingthe goodwill of a panel practice, and this the Ministryof Health had decided to refuse.     If the doctors&apos; rsmimora-tion was put as low as 10/-, while there might not be astrike, many of the best men would certainly be lost, andit was not possible to guarantee that there would not be &amp;strike.     The aim of the Ministry of Health was not merely to avoid a strike,, but to make the doctors feel that theywere being properly treated, and this was of especialimportance if the pledges of the Government in regjpact ofother health services were to be fulfilled, since it was essential for that purpose to have the &apos;geod-w3.il and. co-opara-tion of the meUoal profession.     Further, the Exchequer con-trlbution to the .doctors11 remuneration beinrr 4/3d., the societies haa been Induced to Increase their contribution by 3/-.     If the Societies were informed that the exchequer contribution would be reduced from 4/3d. to 3/3d., and thatthey would have to make up the difference, they would never agree to it.
Owing to the isrp^ssibilit y of reconciling theaiYergeiit^laLte-ye^s-ts of the Mizd-sier of Health and theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Conference agreed:-That the matter should be left to the Home:i 3 ere tar 2/ and the President of the Board OfTrade, who decided: -(i)     That it   a- 3 impossible to fix a rate ofcontribute on by the State towards the additions;! Benefits at a substantially less propc rtion than that contained inthe Unemployment ^Insurance Scheme for thesame total ra2;esTbenefit.(if)     That a good case had been made out for theinc-rease of the remuneration to doctors to11/- per xn--fu.red person per annum proyidedthai the up&quot;? regulations of the Ministry&apos; ofHealtu wore of ouch a nature as to secure asatisfactory service.The Conference thereupon agreed that:-(1)     The President of the Board of Trade srhouldconfer with Br. Add is on, and provided theywero satisfied as the&apos; result&quot;of suoh enquirythe-.&apos;.t the regulations proposed by the Ministryof Health would provide a satisfactorymedical service that: -(2)     The contribution of the State for theAdditional Benefits should he in the same proportion as hitherto;(3)     The remuneration to doctors should be ll/-per- insured person, exclusive of drr*.gsand mileage allowance.Whitehall Gardens.

It was suggestedthat the oil resources of Mesopotamia were so extensivethat sufficient revenue should be forthcoming from themto pay for the whole administration of the country, andthat for that reason private exploitation should be prevented.    It was further explained that the tfar office had started to survey the oilfields of Mesopotamia andhad also begun their survey of the desert for the purposeof advising on the practicability of having a pipe and railway line through the British sphere.of influence.The Foreign Offlcs herd intervened on account of thedifficulties vhich they felt would be raised on accountof the exclusion of the Sta dard Oil Company of America,It was pointed out that inasmuch as the country was inBritish occupation and the &apos;hols expense of the campaignhad fallen on the British Government the Standard oil company had no locus standi and no reason for complaint.The Conference -&quot;ere of opinion that as a matter ofprinciple the profits arising from the exploitation of the oilfields    cf hescpotamia should accrue for the benefit ofthe State rather than for the benefit of Joint StockCompanies and decided :-

RELIEF OF AUSTRIA AND POLAND.

(1) The Chancellor of the Exchequer raised as a question of urgency the grant of credits for the relief of Austria and Poland and he stated that the United States were disposed to limit their assistance to the purchase of American Wheat for which it was proposed the British Government should provide tonnage at blue book rates. In addition the British Government were to provide a credit for the purchase of goods in any part of the world although the United States credit was to be devoted to the purchase of United States produce only. Such an arrangement would be grossly one-sided and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had asked the Foreign Office to inform the United States Government that H.M. Government would be ready to give a credit not exceeding one half of United States credit and not exceeding £10,000,000 in any case; the grant of this credit to be subject to the same conditions mutatis mutandis as in the case of the United States credit, and that each country should find tonnage for the goods which it supplied.

The Conference decided to approve the action taken by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Conwa&amp;sion, had been brought In by the &apos;i^^?hmeni, butthat Bill had not pleased either the miners or the coal*-owners? and the Government therefore considered themselvesreleased from their undertaking to carry out the recemmenda-tlons^of the Commission^     The President of the Board ofTrade now proposed a Bill based on the following principles:-it)   The control of finance to continue to tho endOf August 192-0j(ii)   During that period the Government to guarantee tothe industry nine *-tenths of its pre-war standardprofiti(iii)   If the earnings of the Industry permit, the pre-war standard profit to be made up, and one-tenth of the net aggregate earnings lef  over to boshared out among; the coal-owners In proportion to output *  ; This would be an incentive todevelopmentftAt tho request of the Prime Minister, the present and estimated financial position of the coal industry was explain-ed fey the Coal Controllers, who- stated that the gross profits of the- present financial year were estimated at  26,000,000,This sum would however be absorbed by the allowances to theowners for standard profits and by capital allowances which also amounted to  26^000^000*.     Industrial coal was now being sold at 8&amp;, a ton less than the. cost of production^ -and domestic coal at lOsySdt. a ton loss than the cost of produc-tion without allowing anything for owners profits^     The loss on these two. transactions amounted approximately to  25^.000,000during the present financial year,     as to the future, the calculations of tho Coal Minos Department had not been carried further than August 31, 1920, as their powers under Defenceof tho Realm Regulation 9*G. ended on that date.     It was esti-mated-that the profit on the industry between April 1,. 1920,and August 31, 1920, would be approximately  23,000,000*     Outof this- profit the coal-owners would have to be remunerated,so that the surplus for the five months would amount to somethingbetween  11,000,000 and  12,000,000.     The question was, what should be done with this surplus?Tho President of the Board of Trade stated that ho was disposed to think
that the minors had a ease for      doajor^&amp;s-Q, at an earlydate, In wages of l/- a shift.    This would amount to 1*1/-increase in every two weeks, and would cost. 15... OOO ,000 forthe whole year.    If this increase in wages were granted, only 4,000,000 of the estimated profit during the period April 1to August 31 would remain.    As against this, however, thecoal-owners urged the Government very strongly not to cutaway profits by giving rises in wages.    The proposed Billpromised that one-tenth of the net aggregate earnings left*over from the guarantee, to the industry should be shared outasa&amp;ng the coal-owners, and the owners^maintained that theGovernment should not, b^1 increase of wages, destroy this surplus of one-tenth.    This one-tenth was considered to bean incentive to development.    Unless further development tookplace the coal pitblem would become even more acute in IV $years time than it was now.    It-was considered that the one-tenth would be a sufficient incentive to development if theowners could at the same time be given a decision as to thefuture of the industry.     *The President of the Board of Trade, continuing,&apos;statedthat there ware the following five possible courses before-the Government(a) Unrestricted competition.As regards this possible courso, the result of de-control&apos;would be that all mine-owners would enter the export tradeand would neglect the home trade;    home prices1would probablyrise 15/- a ton on the first day of de-oontrol, and would subsequently reach tha world level;    export prices would,tend to drop;    the miners in&apos;all coalfields would at oncedemand an increase in wages and there would probably be ageneral   -strike, with the result that the whols industry and-export trade of the country would be upset and there wouldhe complete chaos-. &apos; .(b) The establishment of a. Ministry of mines, with limited powers, &quot;to &quot;fceassociated with a Council of ihaindustry,E*i &amp;if a^&amp;^^Jd^ ^ the most
hopeful course.    It was trtur that It would be a temporary measure, but he considered that the Government could not, at, presentthe/moment, make a definite announcement in regard to thefuture of the coal industry, the circumstances of which werechanging from week to week.   A Ministry of Mines would, hethought, provide neutral ground on which coal-owners and coal-ininers could meet, end it would at the same time continue thepresent controls over export and home prices, which ware essea-tial, and would see that profits were equalised.    The miners atthe present moment did not appreciate how far the coal-owners were prepared to go in the direction of sharing&apos; profits,    Theemployers wished to have a common meeting-ground with the men.The three remaining alternatives were:-(c) Enforced district amalgamation, con-*trolled by a Government Department,on the lines of Sir Arthur Duckham&apos;aproposals in his Minority Report asa member of the Sankey Commission;(&amp;) The creation of district publio trusts     to work the mines, on the model of thePort of London Authority:(&amp;) Thoroughgoing nationalisation, witha Government Department as the iltimate authority.fhm last thrash alternatives were mo&amp;i fie cations of nationall-sation*Considerable discussion ensued in regard to proposal(b) abova.    It was urged that the proposal really left mattersmuch as thsy wero, and did not settle the question of nationali-sation, on whioh the country was oxpooting a pronouncement.It would be very difficult to Introduce the proposed bill into the House of Commons with a statement merely that the government had decided to appoint a Committee to prepare ascheme for tho rest of the reconstruction period and that aMinistry of Mines would be set up.    The Government wouldiffim&amp;alately be asked to state what their general policy wasin regard to the coal industry.     On the one hand, it was urged that the essential object at whioh the Governmentshould aim was de-control of the industry.   The ooal-owners
wished to be free, and the Government themselves would never be free until they resigned their control over the industry.It was suggested that the coal- owners should be asked,  inreturn for de-control of the industry,   to guarantee that theywould keep the prices of coal for internal consumption in theUnited Kingdom below fixed maxima.    The trade,  in fact,  shouldeentrcl itself.    On the other hand,  it was pointed out thatthe coal-owners had already stated their inability to controlall the members of their Association.    During the earlierperiod of the War many Coal-Owners had not kept the agreement made with the Coal Owners Association,  and has! resisted theagreement whea    the Bill to confirm it was before the Houseof Commons.    It was hardly likely that they would regard amoral obligation as mere binding in times of peace.    It wouldbe impossible to control the industry effectively except bymeans of compulsion.    The more moderate coal-owners wanted a department *     The Department might be a separate Ministry ornot,  acting with an Advisory Council, subject to :-(i) Restriction of exports by the Department;the(ii) Restriction ef heme price by/Department;and(iii) equalisation ef profits amongat coal-owners.The last was essential, as miners in districts where low wages were&quot;prevalent before the War would not consent to revert tothose wages.It was pointed out that the scheme proposed by thepresident of the Board of Trade might result in driving theowners into nationalisation.   The owners might very well in-sist upon being bcught out of the industry,  in order that theymight invest their capital more remineratively elsewhere.There was a real danger that the owners and the miners wouldcombine in the demand for nationalisation.    It was urged that proposal (b)  above,  as an alternative to nationalisation,should Be made mare explicit.   There was obviously a via media.between complete de-control and complete nationaliatdon,  and before any announcement could be made to the Miners&apos; Federation- 6 -
the nesrt day, or to the House of Commons the next Session,fuller details would have to be provided.It was generally agreed that it would be useful to havea draft, by the President of the Board of Trade, of theannouncement which, in his opinion, tho Prime Minister shouldmake in the House of Commons.   This draft shotild meet thequestion, which would undoubtedly be raised, of the generalcoal policy whioh the Government would adopt.     It should alsotabulate the dangers which-would result froa ^OBple4^-^j0*-o^)ia1rreJL.of the industry, on the one hand, and tho objections to com-plete nationalisation, on the other.     If possible, it shouldmake definite proposals in regard to the Governmentrs policy,The present disnussion would be regarded merely as a prc-limin-ary discussion to clear the ground, and ultimately the Prime    - ,Minister would have to ask the Cabinet for a decision on two alternatives, viz j-(I)-Whether he should make a declaration ofpolicy to the Miners1 Federation on thefollowing day,or(ii) l/hether he should say that he was merelywilling to listen to the miners9 and thatany statement of policy to be made by theGovernment would naturtLily be made in theHouse of Commons and could not be made toa deputation outside ParliamentsThe Conference accordingly decidedThat tho President of the Board of Tradeand the Coal Controller should, in thelight of the above discussion, draft a- statement elaborating the proposal forthe establishment of a Ministry of Mines,with limited powers and in association with. a Council of the industry, and that this statement should be considered at a further meeting of the Conference to be held onthe same -day at 5 p*m.
The Chancellor of tho Exchequer saidthat he wIshed to draw attention to the general question of the control of prices of foodstuffs and other commodities .     The position was that his   \&quot;Department had been counting on a great reductionof the bread subsidy;   but they were now informed by the. Pood Controller and the Wheat Commission &apos;that the subsidy, so far from being reduced might even have to be increased to 65 millions sterling.Further, it was understood that the profit onbutter would make good the loss on cheeses butit now appeared that we were to lose on butteralso* .    He did not wish toi raise- the whole question at that meeting, but he desired to Inform hiscolleagues that tho matter was urgent, and that hehad asked the Food Controller to bring tho question before the Cabinet at a very early date.Reference was made to the present controlof beer, under which the Irish brewer was permitted to brew beers of a higher gravity than was allowed In the caso of the English brewer, whowas consequently severely handicapped and beingdeprived of his market.     Comment waa also made onthe unprecedented profits which were at present being reaped upon practically every uncontrolledarticle of sale, and the,Conference was reminded&apos;that the view had been held by many competentadvisors that the various controls should havebeen maintained for a much longer period.     On theother hand. It was pointed out(that letting go the controls had meant an increase of employment,:whereas their retention would have accentuated analready difficult problem.
*HjTURE! ORGANI-       4.     With reference to Cabinet 2 (550), Oondlusdon 2,5ATI0N OP THE%RIT0RIAL when it had been decided, that the natter should-^fc-e&apos;-referred to an Inter-departmental Committee, theConference had under further consideration the .question of the future organisation of the &apos; -Territorial Force *The Secretary of State for &quot;flar a a id that thiswas a very important topic  which in former years would have engrossed tho attention of the Cabinet .for some days, but circumstances rendered itnecessary that a decision should be reached that morning.     The last time he had brought thequestion before the Cabinet, he had himself beenundecided in mind as to what was tho best policy*He had since discussed the subject with a great number of men, who from their experiences wereicompetent to form and express an opinion, and hewas satisfied that it wag not possible to enlistTerritorials for Home Defence only.     The merefact that we proposed to .raise 14 Divisions was bound to as*ouse suspicions     Ho had, therefore,,come to the conclusion that it would be bestfrankly and plainly to ask would-be recruits ,to *accept Imperial and Oversea obligations and tell them that If, for instance, Germany appeared again on the Rhine, or Russia was advancing on India, theywould have to proceed overseas.     At the same time it was desirable to re-assure those we hoped toencourage to come forward, by stating that theywould not have to cross the sea until an Act ofParliament&apos; had been passed stating that a nationalcrisis existed.     Accordingly,&apos; he suggested thefollowing stepsp (a) recruits should he told thatthey were wanted for Imperial defence in certaincontingenciesj    (b) that they might be embodied when
an emergency arose;    (c) that they would not be sentput of the country until an Act had been passedclearly showing that a national emergency had arisen.At the saris time - and all who had any knowledge and experience of Territorial sentiment attached the greatest importance to this - they should beinformed that they would only be sent overseas asunits^,It might further be statedthat His Majesty&apos;s Government only contemplated awar of self-defence, and they would therefore awaitwith confidence any emergency.     To attempt toraise.a large force of 14 Divisions for any other purpose than to undertake Imperial obligations,would be regarded as humbug by the general publicWho would think that they - were being Invited tocome forward and enlist in large numbers for strike-breaking purposes, and so on;    while they would be convinced in their own minds that the government intended to send them abroad in any case when itsuited them,,     He had only arrived at this conclu-sion after much anxious thought, but it representedhis deliberate and considered opinion; he&apos; therefore in statingurged complete frankness ych.au officers and men ofthe Territorial Force should be asked to accept a liability for General Service,,     He had recentlydiscussed the question at a meeting of representa-tives of the Territorial Organisations, who were pratically unanimous in agreeing that this liabilityshould be imposed though their views perhaps werebysomewhat vitiated / the fact that their wish wasfather to the thought.
Some discussion followed In the course ofwhich it was stated that the present British ambassador in Paris who, both before and during the war, had been closely associated with recruiting for the territorial force and for the Kitchener Army, was very doubtfulas to the advisability of adopting.the policy suggestedby the Secretary of State for War.     On the otherhand, there was general agreement among the ministers present as to the desirability of taking the lino-,recommended by Mr. Churchill *The Secretary of State for War said that hehad re-cast to some extent the scheme (CP,371) whichhe had recently submitted to the Cabinet, but he waskeeping it well.within the former financial limit-He decided to have one Class only In the territorial force, but he was keeping alive 74 Battalions ofthe old Special Reserve, which he proposed to re-christenthe Militia.     This Militia was liable to be called outin aid of the Civil Power, whenever necessary.     his idea was that oi&amp;r Army of the future should consist cftWw lines.- (a) tho Regular Array and the Militia, and(b) the 3?erri ol?i al Foro^ was also assemblingshortly a Conference to decide the future organisationof the Yeomanry.     in reply to A question by thePrime Minister, Mr. Churchill said, that volunteers for the Air Force were at present being recruited bythe Air Ministry and he thought that this procedure was best at the present stage.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated thathe understood that the scheme, as re-cast by Mr.Churchill^ would work within the present estimates.He wished to point out, however, that for the nextyear or two the estimates of the Service departments would be a matter of great difficulty and he doubted whether the Departments would be able to keep within their limits.     He suggested, therefore,,that the War
Of fire should, for the next two or three years,reduce the expenses of the Territorial Force below-normal, if possible,  by limiting the number tfcamps, drills, and so sn.The Secretary of state for &quot;War stronglydeprecated lowering the efficiency of the new Forcewe proposed to raise, in order to save what would bea comparatively small sum.The Conference decidedTo approve in principle(a) That the pre-war Territorial Faroeshould be reconstituted and organisedas 14 Divisions, composed similarlyto the regular Divisions of the Army.(b) That officers and men of the iTerritorial Force should accept \liability for General Service,with the undertaking by HisMajesty&apos;s Government that no member of the Force should bes*lent overseas until parliament had decided that a national emergency had arisen of so seriousa character as to Justify this step.(o) That it is the intention of theGovernment that the Territorial *Force,  as re-organised should notbe used for draft-finding purposesof the Regular Army,, but that unitsalone should in the first instancebe sent overseas, e.g* battalions,brigades of artillery, or regimentsof cavalry.
OUR POLICY IN RUSSIA-EVACUATION FROM SOUTH RUSSIA OF NON-BOLSHEVIK ELEMENTS.

5. The Chief of the Imperial Staff asked permission to draw the attention of the Conference to the situation in South Russia. A telegram had recently been receiving asking for British assistance in evacuating not only the sick and wounded men of non-Bolshevik elements, but also women and children from South Russia. The " Panama" with 550 cases of sick on board, including many typhus cases, had arrived at Constantinople, we had agreed to take in 1,000 such cases at Constantinople. Our Commissioner at Constantinople had wired for nursed and doctors to attend to these cases, but it was quite impossible for the War Office to supply them. While the Conference was sitting, he had received a further telegram from our Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean saying that he had ordered every transport available to proceed to Sevastopol to evacuate 25,000 invalids and refugees from Sevastopol: these numbers were apart from the 30,000 cases that were awaiting evacuation at or near Odessa. The Field-Marshal said that he would like instructions as to what should be done. He himself thought that it was impossible for us to shoulder this burden alone, and that it should be shared by France and Italy.

 Some discussion followed, in the course of which it was pointed out that, while no humane person could possibly be deaf to such an appeal, it was impossible for Great Britain to undertake a responsibility of this kind which she was quite unable to discharge. Reference was made to the suggestion which had been put forward that those cases might be landed on some of the islands in the Eastern Mediterranean where a certain number of huts existed for their accommodation, but there were at present no mean of supplying the patients with food.

It was/    
It was urged that as it was absurd for us to pretend that we could feed, doctor, nurse, house, and provide for all these thousands of wounded, invalids and children, the only practical alternative was that the non-Bolshevik elements in South Russia should capitulate to their opponents; that our policy in the future should be not to encourage small nations on the borders of Russia to fight the Bolsheviks, but to advise them to make peace with the Soviet Government, and that in any case we must do nothing which would stand in the way of their coming to terms with that Government. In support of this policy it was pointed out that the Bolsheviks had, after all, practically nothing to gain by over-running Poland, Germany, Hungary, Persia or Roumania, or even the Caucasus, except that they might gain control of the oil fields in the latter region. These countries could offer nothing to the Bolshevik armies but famine and typhus, and history showed that hordes of barbarians only over-ran foreign territories for purposes of loot. The argument was pressed, on the other hand, with great force that it was obviously the policy of the Soviet Government to make peace for the present with the Entente Powers, and in particular with Great Britain, as this would leave the directors of the Soviet regime complete freedom to persue their designs against the smaller nations on their borders. Russia was now dominated by two very able, unscrupulous, and dangerous men, who had well disciplined armies and enormous resources at their disposal.

 THE PRIME MINISTER said that M. Patek, the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs, who was at present in London, had been to see him the previous day in order to discuss the situation with him. M. Patek had pointed out that both Kolchak and Denikin had now been completely defeated, and were probably incapable of any further/


further- resistance^     In the circumstances were theEntente Powers prepared to support Poland with armed forces, munitions etc1!     Tho Prime Minister said that hehad felt strongly that ho ought to be quite frank with me Patok, and he had. accordingly told him that it waaImpossible for ourselves and our Allies to give him sup-port of the nature indicated by him.     He further informedMs. Patok that if Poland embarked on a war with theSoviet Government wo must wash our hands of all respon-sibilityoThe general trend of the discussion was in the sense that, in tho circumstances, no good would be gained by the proposed action of tho Commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean to send out all available shipping,which was urgently needed elsewhere,, to Odessa *It was agreed that the Conference,-before reaching any decision should await and consider tho report of $iy H.J.Mackinder,who had arrived in England, and he hoped to submit his report to the Prime minister in the course of the next day or so*2, Whitehall Gardens, S.&apos;7.1,27th January, 1920.
APPENDIX

Points to be raised at the meeting of the MINERS FEDERATION OF GREAT BRITAIN.



1. The enormous increase in the price of exported coal resulting in enhanced profits to the colliery owners who are engaged in the export trade.

2. The continued high price of industrial coal for home consumers.

3. The failure of domestic consumers to obtain supplies since the reduction in the price of domestic coal by 10/- per ton, which took place on December 1st 1919.

4. The effect of the continued high price of coal on the cost of living of the people.

5. An application by this Federation that there should be an immediate and considerable reduction in the price of industrial coal followed by Government action to reduce the cost of commodities now produced in factories, etc., into which the cost of coal largely enters; or, alternatively, the consideration by the Government of an application by this Federation for an advance in wages consequent upon the high cost of living.

THE COAL INDUSTRY. 

(1) The Conference met in order to continue the discussion of the Coal Industry which took place at their meeting at 11-30 in the morning.

 The Prime Minister stated that since that meeting he and the Lord Privy Seal had had an interview with three of the leading mine-owners, namely, Lord Gainford, Sir Adam Nimme and Mr. Evan Williams. As a result of the discussion it transpired that the mine-owners would consent to the following proposals, viz:-

 (1) As long as abnormal conditions continue the Government shall be equipped with the necessary statutory powers --.

 (a) to equalise profits in the coal industry:

 (b) to control the quantity of coal available for export:

 (c) to restrict prices of coal for the home market.

 (2) That, in the arrangements for the computation of profit, adequate inducements should be afforded to economical production and development:

 (3) In order to secure co-operation between owners and workmen in the working of the mines, same machinery should be set up for joint consultation, and it is desirable that a special Department of Mines should be created.

The mine-owners emphasized very strongly their desire that action by the Government should not be exercised directly, but by means of an organisation representatives of owners, miners and the general public, save in two special contingencies: (i) during the purely provisional period until the organisation is set up; and (ii) in the event of failure of the parties concerned to come to an agreement.

 The adoption of the above proposals would involve a clear statement by the Government that the goal to be attained was de-control. That condition was regarded as one of complete health, and the Government powers should only be exercised in abnormal conditions. The Bill, therefore, to be introduced, by the Government should, in the opinion of the


mine-owners, not be a temporary measure designed to meet aparticular set *sf abnormal conditions, but should be apermanent measure operating when abnormal conditions arose,and in normal times shouldjfogiain dormant.   The decision asto when the measure should operate should remain with theGovernment.General agreement was expressed that the proposals of the mine-owsiBrs far Bed a good starting-point for discussion and were a real alternative to the policy suggested at theearlier Conference, which involved a confession that theGovernment had no definite policy in regard to the coalindustry.    It should be maintained that the Government werenot interfering with individual enterprise, but that theywere entitled to intervene if eondit-iesis were abnormal.Th&amp; Conference agreed :-That the proposals ef the aitne-owners, as outlined by the Prime Mini ster, formed areasonable basis for further negotiation with the mine-ewirerfl and miners.----   *$!hw $U&amp;srtioh whether the propped department ef mines should -regain with the Board *f Trade er not was reservedfor .further oonsiderationiiiitation (S)   fix&apos;M* vtme &quot;Minister again referred te the Deputationthe prime,-later        - which he was receiving the following day from the Miners&apos;the^era* Federation, and to the points which the Deputation proposedderation.to raise (Appendix).As regards paragraph 1the Conference agreed :-That a sufficient reply to this point wouldbe to say that the Government are introducing a BUI to deal with the situation the momentparliament re-assembles.AS regards paragraph 2   the Conference agreed, thatthe reply should beThat *at present industrial ooal is being sold at a price which involves a loss ofSdf a ton, without taking into considera-tion the profits to be paid to the owners.As regards paragraph j3, the Conference agreed(a) That the Prime Minister should take the line that there is no failure to provide suppliesof domeatio coal.: - Z **i
(b) That, the President of the Board *f Trad-? shoul 1furnish a detailed case to the Prime Miniate.&apos;.* As regards paragraph 4 the Conference agreed that the reply should he :-That the Government were fully alive to theeffect *f the high price of coal on the costof living,  and were deeply concerned by it.Considerable discussion took place in regard to paragraph5A   viz.,  the demand that there should be an immediatereduction in the price of industrial coal,  followed by Govern-ment action to reduce the cost of coirmoditi es produced in factories.    It was pointed out that the discussion that morning had shown that, in the period from April 1 to August31, 1520,  there would probably be &amp; profit wf some  11,000,000resulting from the working of the1 coal industry.   The ilterna-tives were :- ta transfer this profit to the Exchequer; togive it. to the miners in the fera of increased wages; tngive it to the foreigner by reducing the price of exportedcoal; or,  finally,  to reduce the cost of household andindustrial coal.   In favour of the first alternative it waspointed out that if the cost of living rose five pointsthere would be a rise in railway wages an &amp;n the wages ef9ther industries.    This   rsia^ would result in an irresistibledemand from the colliers for a rise in their wages.   Thebest course would be, therefore,  to accept the profits andto use them for th : purpose of reducing the cost of livingi.e.,  by using them to maintain the subsidies for wheat andother foodstuffs.    The objections to using the anticipatedprofits of  11,000,000 to increase the wages of miners were that the miners had already set the pact in the increaseof wages,  and other trades had not reached their level.   Afurther rise in miners&apos; wages would initwate a new cycle ofwags   increases..    It was quite possible, moreover,  that, long before the profits in question were realised,  the miners&apos;case,for an increase in wages would have become unanswerable,owing to an increase in the cost of living, ana the profitswould,  therefore, never actually materialise.
It was alsg es&amp;slderM undealr&amp;bla      derate anyprofit which might aoarue from the eoak-mining,industry tothe reduction of the price of exported coal.   The position was that the prlaa of home coal was at an artificially low level and the price of exported coal was the economic price.The resulting high prices for exported eoal were due to theinteraction of supply and demand.   Prance, Italy, and other foreign countries, had no right to claim that British coal should be sold abroad at a price below the market price *It would also tee undesirable to earmark the anticipated,profit for the purpose of reducing the home price c  ooalstill further, and It should bs maintained that the contentionin paragraph 5 of the memorandum by the minors Federation(see Appendix) had already been met by the action of theGovernment in dropping the F&quot;ie$ cf household coal to anuneocmomid le^eleIt was pointed out that the French were selling coal to the Italians at far higher prices than were obtained byBritish coal exported to Italy, and It was very important,moreover, that as much British coal as possible should be sold abroad at a high     price for the purpose of maintaining xch&amp;nges.     The present policy did not involve a-jy hardship to British manufacturers, as exports were only allowed whenindustries had been fully supplied,-fhe Cotifereh.ee agreed&quot;&quot;--(i)    That the reply to the question raised in paragraph 5 -ef the memorandum by theMiners&apos; Federation (see appendix) shouldbe: -That the question does not arise inany case until April 1,  that it is! impossible to forecast with any accuracy&apos; what the profits (if any) on the coalindustry will be, and that the Govern-ment have already adopted the principleoutlined in the paragraph by sellingindustrial and household coal at an uneconomic price.
iii)    That it waa undseirahle to allocate in     117advance the possibles profit of  11.-000,000&quot;on the working of the coal jj^dustry between april 1 and August 31 r  l&apos;?20.(3)     The Conference had under further ooneideratlona Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade (paper cp. 307) suggesting the ostabliohment of a Ministry of mines *The Conference decidedThat the matter was one which should beleft for further consideration.Stocks. (4)      The President of the Boarc? of Traie informed the Conference that stocks of coal were dangerously low atthe present time and that any cessation of output would create a oriels.    In order to bring reserve stocks of coalup to four-Weeks&apos; supply by March 31, it would be necessaryfor 600,000 tons of extra tonnage to he provided.   Thiswould involve the allocation of 25&quot; vessels to the carriage of coastwise coal, and the provision of 4C0 ooal trains aweek extra.    It was very important, therefore, that in discussions with the coal-miners any question of a strikeshould be avoided.   Efforts were1 being made, with the co-operation of the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry ofTransport, to provide the necessary tonnage for increasingstocks.The Conference took note of the above statement made by the President of the Board of Trade,  and agreed that the matter should be gone into furtherby the Board of Trade, the Ministry of Shipping.and the Ministry of Transport,Return of (5)     The attention of the Conference was drawn to coal Wagonsfrom Prance, the fact that the ooal problem arose very largely from the inadequacy of transport, whiah, it was contended,  could belessened to some extent by a speedier return of railway wagons and engines from Prance.The Conference decided:-That the Secretary of Statn for War should beasked to go into the question of the return ofrailway wagons and engines from Prance,  and tocommunicate the result of his investigations tothe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Transport.proposedMinistryof MineB.Htehall Gardens,S.WJanuary 27,1920.
