Cabinet, dealing with the issue of communicax:..ons to thePress by Government Departments (Paper CP,-387) .It was explained that in some Departments the practiceobtained of issuing matter of a technical character to technical and professional journals in advance of the dallypapers,  so that, the specialist journals might have time notonly to publish the matter in full, but also,to prepareconsidered articles upon it,.It was generally agreed that  this practice shouldcontinue,  and need not conflict wxth the objects aimed at
disability pensions.SCOTTISHNATIONAL war memorial,.by the Newspaper Proprietors&apos; Association.The Cabinet approved, the draft instructions which had been prepared,  subject to SirMaurice Haftkey making satisfactory arrange-ments with Lord Riddell on the question of communications to technical journals.(3) The attention of the Cabinet was called to certain proposals which had been made by the Admiralty to theTreasury for the revision of Disability Pensions, and tothe importance of the possible reaction of such proposalsupon Army and Royal Air Force pensions.The Cabinet decided  That the Admiralty proposals should bereferred to the Interdepartmental Com-mittee suggested to be set up by theHome Affairs Committee (H.A;C.45thMinutes, Minute 4 (4) ), together witha representative of the Treasury, with sir L, Worthingion-Evans as Chairman andMr Leith Ross as Secretary,(4) With reference to War Cabinet 303, Minute 15,  ofDecember 20,  1917, the Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary for Scotland,; setting forth the main recommendations of the Committee dealing with the schemefor utilising Edinburgh Castle as a Scottish National war memorial&apos; (Paper CP.--448).   The Committee estimated thatfor the whole scheme a sum of  2,50*000 would be required;or if the State were to contribute the  65,000 requiredfor adaptations to house the National Museum of Antiquities,a sum of  185,000 would be required.&apos;  The Cabinet were asked (l) to approve the continuance of the Committee, withnowers to make an appeal for funds for the purposes enumeraled in their Report:    (2.) to approve generally the architec-tural features of the scheme.    At this stage no promise of a State contribution was sought.It was pointed out that considerable appre?aensionwas entertained in Scotland as to the effect of thearchitectural proposals on the appearance of&apos;the Castle,and that there was,among some architects,  strong oppositionto the Committee&apos;s scheme.    It was therefore questionable
Jbwhether t2ae-^&amp;.bi^^.....any opinion, on the merits of the plans suggested.The Cabinet decided- -(a) That, as there was some division ofopinion in Scotland upon the scheme,they couli a not express any view byway of approval or otherwise in regardto it.    They were willing, however, thatan appeal should be made aa suggested, onthe understanding that,if it a success were such as to indicate a general measure of approval,  the Government would offer noobjection to the carrying out of thescheme under Government&apos;supervision,but without any promise of a government grant:-(b) That, as Mr Hun-re was in Scotland andunable to be present at the discussion,he should re--open the matter before theCabinet on has ieturn,  if he wished theabove decis1on reviewed.HE CENOTAPH (5) With reference to Cabinet 18 (19), Conclusion 7,3 WHITEHALL.the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries (Japer CP,-468) criticising thesuggestion to reproduce the national flags, which now decor-ate the Cenotaph, in carved and dyed Portland stone on thepermanent structure.    It was urged that such treatment wasaesthetically objectlonable and would greatly weaken theemotional appeal of the monument.It was explained that Sir Edwin Lutyens had himselfbeen willing to contemplate the use of dyed stone, but hewas -not  strongly wedded to the experiment.    The estimatedannual cost of renewable silk flags, which were to be prefer-red to ordinary bunting,, was about .  40.The Cabinet were of the opinion that silkflags,  and not dyed stone., should be used,and&quot; the Office of Works were&apos; requested tocommunicate with Sir Edwin Lutyens in this sense.OLLECTION AND     (6) The Cabinet had before them a Petition,  signed by theASSENTATION &apos; ,&apos;? -OFFICIAL     President of the Royal Statistical Society and others,  urgingSTATISTICS .the need of a re-organisation of the present system of official statistics, together with a covering note by the acting Secretary to the Cabinet  (Paper CP.-434).
C- *7The suggestion was made that, as the matter was oneof eons ide r-a bio -importance -d/O - a- numbe r of Gove mm e nt department -1 -ments (e,g., the Board of Trade,  the Board of Agriculturefand Fisheries,  the Admiralty, the Board of Inland Revenue,the Board of Customs and Excise,  the Ministry of Health andthe Ministry of Labour),  an Interdepartmental   Committeeshould he set up rather than a Royal Commission or Parlia-mentary Committee.    The Cabinet were informed that the matter was one which was already under consideration by the Boardof Trade and the Statistical Officers of various Departments.The Cabinet decided  (a) That,  in the first instance, the Presidentof the Board of Trade,  after consultationwith the Departmeiv&amp;s chiefly concerned,should prepare a Memorandum on the subject for circulation to the Cabinet:(b) That, pending receipt of the above Memoran-dum, the action to be taken on the Petitionshould be deferred.establishment        (7) The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the FirstA BLOCKADE!/IS0RY Lord of the Admiralty suggesting the appointment of a Stand-Em TEE.ing Blockade Advisory Cormmittee (Paper 0.^.-355) .It was explained that the Prime Minister had approved the re-formation of the Co-ordination Committee of theCommittee of Imperial Defence, which wouid shortly meet.Previous to the War,  various Standing Sub-Committees ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence considered and made recommendations on such questions as Trading with theEnemy, Maintenance of Overseas Commerce in Time of War,etc.,etc., and to a great  extent the contents.of the WarBook were based on the policy recommended in the Reportsof these Standing Sub-Committees.The Cabinet decided  To refer the proposal of the Board ofAdmiralty to the Co-ordination Commit-tee for action as required.3 OF (3) The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated&apos; that he hadbeen asked by the Chairman of the Liquor Control Board to-IQfJOR
HE EMPLOYMENT      (9) The Cabinet took note of Conclusion 2 of a cabinet JUDGES to reside OVER   Conference held in Paris on January II,  1920:*-MDUSTRIAL)&apos;JRT&apos;S . &quot;That Lord Shaw of Dunf ermlihe should beappointed President of the Enquiry intothe wages of Transport Workers;    but, inview of the congestion in the work of theLaw Courts, as explained to the conference by the Lord Chancellor,  and the frequentdemands made on the Judicial Bench incases of this kind, the Prime Minister.,without committing himself to any par-ticular number, undertook to give favour-able consideration to the Lord Chancellor&apos;3request for an increase in the number of judges,&quot;   (Paper CP.-52.)(j     *     *     t*2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1,January 21, 1920.furnlah^fdgures- dealing &quot;VltJr taae--pr^Tfit^-..of the liquor trade.Lord D&apos;Abernon wished to make public use of these figures in -connection with various proposals dealing with the future ofthe liquor trade.It was pointed out that there were political and revenue objections to furnishing the particulars asked for,but that while it was undesirable,  particularly for reasons connected with the revenue, to extend the practice,  the liquor trade was in a special position and not so open tothe  objections which might be urged in connection with otherindustries.    In any case it was probable that,  in the imme-diate future,  considerable pressure would be brought to bearon the Government to reveal the profits of a-number of themore prosperous industries.
