S     (1) With reference to /the Prime Ministers Conferenceheld on-November 10,, 1919, Minute 1, the Cabinet had before&quot;... &quot; JBthen a Note by the Secretary (Paper CP.-393) and a Note bythe Acting Secretary of State for. the Colonies (Paper C.P.-49,6),  dealing with the question of communications betweenthe League of Nations and the Self-Governing Dominions.It -was pointed out that there were serieug objectionsto the business of the League being conducted directly be-tv/een the Secretary-General and.the  several Dominions.    Ifsuch a procedure -ere adopted it was inevitable that, on oon-t-oVerbial and doubtful issues different views would be com-muni.ca.ted and sustained by different parts of the Empire, witlthe consequence that when a crisis arose they might well die-cover that they had drifted into divergent or even antagonisttic attitudes.    Such a result,would damage the Empire in the eyes of foreign nations, and have unfortunate reactions onthe internal relations of the ComnonweaIth.    To avoid this situation it had been suggested  (i) That a Branch of the Cabinet Secretariatshould act as a clearinf-house,  and shouldforward- communications for the League tothe Dominions, and receive their repliesfor transmission to the Secretary-General:(ii) That each Dominion should appoint anofficer to such Branch of the cabinet secretariat:(iii) That,  in addition to (11),  each Dominionshould appoint as its  representative inLondon, for League of Nations purposes,some person of sufficient  standing   suchas a High Commissioner - able to form a judgment on the points at issue and make recommendations ^ith a vie&apos;&quot; to securing acommon course of action.With reference to the third suggestion above,  attentic--as called to a decision of the Imperial Cabinet, held in1918,  recommending the appointment of Dominion representativeof ministerial rank, who should be permanently settled inLondon.    Doubt had been cast on the feasibility of thisproposal by some of the Dominion Prime ministers,  and in anyoase the uncertain political situation in the Dominions had made it difficult  for them to spare,  for London, r-epresenta-tives oar^ying the necessary &apos;:--ei fht .    There would certainly
be no agreement as to the nomination of High Commissionerafor the discharge of the functions proposed.The Cabinet decided  To request the Acting Secretary of Statefor the Colonies and the Secretary of Statefor India to communicate with the Self-Governing Dominions and India respectively  (a) Emphasizing the importance of develop-Ing a common policy in regard to ques-tions coming before the League ofNations and the dangers of oeparateand direct corcmunication with theLeague:(b) Suggesting as an ad interim arrangementthat communications between the league and the Dominions should pass throughthe new Branch of the Cabinet Secreta-r-iat:(c) Suggesting the consideration of the ap-pointment of responsible persons, notnecessarily Ministers, but of higher authority than the Staff of the Secre-tariat, who should be specially con-cerned with the activities of the Leagueof Nations:(d) Inviting their observations on the above,and any further suggestions or alterna-tives.THE CASPIAN (S) The attention of the Cabinet was directed to a telegrarSITUATION.which had been received at the War Office from General Holmanshowing that General Denikin&apos;s position was desperate andthat a complete collapse might occur almost immediately.    Alarge o^opo^tion of General Denikin&apos;s array was believed tobe desirous of superseding him by a pro-German Government organisation.    The Eolshevihs had a powerful.cavalry force which was led with great  skill and was pushing forward at avery rapid rate.    In these circumstances the Chief of theImperial General Staff had ordered General Holman to collect the personnel of his Mission.,at Novorossisk,  and the Admiral&apos;had ordered warships to cover their re-embarkation shouldthe threatened collapse render their further presenceneedless.According to General Holman,  Si- H. Mackinder had given a guarantee to General Denikin that we will,evacuatethe wives and children of a certain number, unspecified.,  ofGeneral Denikin&apos;s officers.    No confirmation of this had
\J;been received,  and it would be difficult, to carry out sue/guarantee without the despatch of at least a couple of battal-ions.    Should the Bolsheviks continue to advance successfullyit was probable that Georgia and Azerbaijan would go over tothem.    As we had six battalions in the Datum Province whowould thus be menaced,  it was,  in the vie-&apos; of the War Office,,desirable that they should be withdrawn before fighting began in their immediate neighbourhood, and with their withdrawal-&apos;Ould fall our control of the  Caucasus, the Caspian andTransoaspia.The Cabinet, were informed that a telegram conveyingthe above had been sent by the Secretary of State for ?ar tothe Prime Minister, and that on the previous day a meet insof the Eastern Committee had been held in response to a re-quest from Paris from the Secretary of State for Foreign-Affairs.    At this meeting the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff had indicated several alternative lines of defence against possible Bolshevik aggression, but,  in view of our inability to find the necessary troops, the Committee had advised against, attempting to hold any of the lines indicated(F.O. telegram No.44,  January IS,  1920).   As against this view it was urged that, however successful the Bolshevik advanceload been up to the present, it was improbable,  owing to thenature of the country, that it should continue at the same rate in the Caucasus, and a failure to send adequate troops now would only involve us in much larger commitments later on when Persia was threatened. .The Cabinet took note  (a) That the Secretary of State for War had given instructions to concentrate the British Missionwith General Denikin at Novorossisk for safety and ultimate evacuation if found necessary-.(b) That the First Lord had given instructions that not less than two warships should be sent toNovorossisk to cover the embarkation of theBritish Mission,  and any friendly  refugeesrrhom it might be possible to assist, to escape(c) The Cabinet entirely approved the proposed stepsto safeguard the British gar-is on in the DatumProvince,  and were strongly of opinion that it-3-
OLA MAT ION (3)    The Cabinet had before them Memoranda by the Actini?A. STATEppAOfl. Secretary of &quot;Vtate for the Colonies  (Paper C.P:-*419 and O.P.-423) and copies of telegrams which had been exchanged betweenthe Colonial Office and the Governors-General of Australia,Canada,  Newfoundland and the Union of South Afirica, with covering note by the Acting Secretary to the  Cabinet (paper c.P.-439)iThe Cabinet were informed that enquiries had beenreceived from the Dominions asking the exact date on whichratification of the Treaty with Germany would be depositedby three of the Allied Powers, and also whether a Proclama-tion of Peace would be issued at that,date,  or, if not,  at what later date.    The Union of South Africa were anxious,  invie1&quot; of their Amnesty Act and Income Tax Act,  for theinternal purposes of the Union, that a state of peace shouldbe declared to have come about within the Union from thedate  of the ratification of the peace with. Germany onJanuary 10th,    Similar action had been taken by the canadian government aa from January 1st,    The Colonial Office had advised the Dominion Governments that it was not proposed toissue a further Proclamation in the United Kingdom regardingthe  coming into force of the Treaty with Germany,  and,  inview of the urgency of the question, the Colonial Office hadacquiesced in the action which the Union Government of SouthAfrica proposed to take,  and now asked for Cabinet approval.The view was expressed that no inconvenience was likely to arise from the policy adopted by the Dominions, and.it was explained that the  -&quot;Termination of the Present &quot;Jar(Definition) Act, 1913&quot; drew a clear distinction between thetermination of the present War as  a whole  and with anyshould, be withdrawn at the earliest momentvhen it appeared desirable to do so on mil-it ary grounds:(d) The Cabinet instructed the Acting Secretaryto obtain from the Foreign Office any inform-ation available in regard to the allegedguarantee given by Sir H. Mackinder to Gen-eral Denikin,

It was necessarythat the Tar Emergency Laws (Continuance) Bill should be passed before the larger Order in Council was made, butthere was no relation between that Bill and the making ofa particular and limited Order in Council dealing with aparticular enemy,  e.g.,  Ge-many, and in the opinion of the attorney-General it was desirable to make such a limitedOrder because a number of coiitracts would thereby be affected.Further,  in the opinion of the A+torney-General, sections inthe Education and other Acts,which &quot;ere to come into opera-tion on the t eriaination of the War, would not be affected bya limited Order in Council under Sub-section 3, but woiild atthe prope&quot; time require the general Order dealing with thetermination of the lar as a whole.The Cabinet took note of the action whichhad been taken by the Colonial Office, and,subject to any representations which mightbe made by any of the Departments  concerned,. approved the proposal to  submit a limitedOrder dealing with Germany to&apos; His majesty in Council, unde- Section 1,  Sub-Section 3,of the  &quot;Termination of the Present &quot;Jar &apos;..
