cast i ah     (1)uatioh.&quot;the First Sea Lord on the subject of the situation in the caspian (CP.401).     The First Sea lord&apos;s proposal was to resume the control of the Caspian, whioh was at presentthreatened by the bolsheviks and likely to fall, by taking over etonoe as mm$ of General Denikin&apos; &amp; ships as he would agree to transfer, a?3&amp; man them with British crews from theMediterranean.     This would enteil the occupation by Britishtroops of 6 navel base at Baku.The Cabinet were informed that so long as these ships had been manned by British oraws, though numerically inferiorin strength to the Bolsheviks, they had dominated the Caspian,At the evacuation of the Caucasus by British troops theBritish seamen were withdrawn and replaced from General Deni-kin&apos;s forces who were not vary reliable.     The recent reversessustained by General denikin coupled with the approach of theBolsheviks to  resnovodsk rendered it by no moans improbable that the crews would mutiny end desert General Lenikln.   if that happened it would involve tho total loss of the Caspian -a contingency of great importance in view of our rssponsi-bilities in Persia, Mesopotamia sad India.     The maintenanceof our pov^ar over the Caspian in the view of the military experts would involve the holding of the Batum^Bsku line andthis would probably require et least two divisions.The Cabinet agreedThat representatives of the admiralty war Staff,.the War Office General Staff,and the . Air Staff, should moot to advise the Cabinet on the advantages of retainingcontrol of&apos;the Caspian and the disadvantages of its loss, and secondly,the militaryaeval-and air&apos;measures necessary to ensure command of the Caspian.&apos;   (2) THE FUTURE
FUTURE (2)   The Cabinet had before them three Memoranda on thefjttSATIOBBjiHS subject of the future of the Territorial $ores by the ill TO RIAL:CE. Secretary of state for Wsr, CP.371, C?.371-A., &amp; CP.388.The Cabinet r,&amp;3?&amp; asked for two me in decisions(1) For approval in principle of the proposalsof the Seoretery of State for Wer.i 2) For a specific decision ae to whetherTerritorials should be asMed to undertake the obligation for general service, to be. operative in a national emergency suffioi-ently grave to require the calling out ofthe arm;? Reserve by Royal Proclamation.It was explained that the proposals had been   framedso as to fell within the sum o.f  75,000,000, wfaioh had been laid down as the normal peace expenditure for the Army endAir Forces combined.     Of this suss  13,000,000 had been allocated to the Air force.     The Cabinet were reminded thatthe Government had boss publicly committed to the reconnaisance-struction of the Territorial Force, end * meeting of theTerritorial Force Association had been summoned for the15th January;   a decision was therefore urgently required.It was further explained that the object of thepresent proposals was not to provide drafts for the regulararmy, but in tho event of a war arising which necessitatedtho dispatch of the whole regular army overseas, thisscheme- would enable further troops to be called up and made available.It was generally recognised that in the event of aGerman attack on the Rhine, the passing of a ConscriptionAot would become necessary.     The object of the present scheme was to provide relnforoeaients before a ConscriptionAot oould operate, end particularly to assist in wars of moderate extent.     Owing to the temporary lack of any army reserve
Res err e during t3m -years preo-eding the full developmentof the new military system, the Territorial Force would &quot;be far more likely than in normal times to he called up.In order to extend the liability to cover servioe overseasen amendment of the Territorial Force Act would he necess-ary, and It W88 pointed out that during the progress ofsuch an emondment in -the House, ex$^ssion would be givento the public apprehension in regard to the possibilitiesof service in Russia, &quot;   In any ca/se\: such apprehension would prove a serious deterrent to recruiting.     It was suggest-ed that the pay proposed for the Territorials bore noproper relation to that of the Special. Reserve when theoontingent liability of the two Forces, was oompared, endfurther that the obligation for general defence would beregarded as a handicap to- regular- employment,     Consequent-ly if a general service liability was imposed many of thebest men would refuse to join, and the Territorial force would tend to relapse in regard to the oias$ of menenlisted to the status of the   old Militia Force.Great stress wse laid by the Military authorities on the serious weakening of the value of the territorial force in medium wars if it was not available for foreignservioe, and it was pointed out by those in touch with theForoe, and with long experience of the classes likely tocompose it, that there was a widespread desire that theForoe should be taken seriously.     If the Force were driven back to pre-war conditions of service the responsewas likely to be extremely poor.     Consultation withleading members of the Territorial Force had convinced the Military Authorities that the chief prevailing fearin regard to overseas service was that the men would besent out as drafts.     That difficulty had been overcome by the provision of the Special Reserve which would serve as a buffer.In view.of the political difficulties in the way ofthe wider liability to service&apos;and.the possibility of thescheme
posals were discussed, e*g.(1)    That the Territorials should he asKed toaccept a liability for general servioe for thedefence of the British Empire.(2)    That they should he given a choice, ofalte^ativ-e liabilities,(3)    That to meet the objection to the handicapto employment, liability for foreign service shouldbe imposed only for the first two years of service.(It was pointed out that this Would break up units.)(4)   That there should be no power to send theTerritorials abroad until, no1&amp; only the general reserve had been called up, but also Parliament had passed a resolution &apos;to this effect.     (This it wassuggested would not he regarded by the individualterritorial as a sufficient safeguard under existingparliamentary conditions).(5)    That there should be no power to send the Terri-torials abroad until the passage of a general Con-scnptioii Act. . (This was criticised on the groundthat a Conscription Act would be a very drasticmeasure to take for one of those wars of moderateextent which might reasonably be apprehended duringthe next, few years.   Moreover, the adoption of thiscourse would commit the nation to conscription inoertain contingencies, and this alone in the present state of public   opinion would be likely to destroy the scheme).After some discussion the Cabinet -agreed  (1)   To adjourn&apos;the discussion until thefollowing week&apos;:( )    That in the meantime the subject be sub-mitted to a Cabinet Committee composedof the Secretary of State for War, thePresident, of the Board of Trade, theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries,and the Deputy Minister of.; Munitions, forconsideration and report.
E SHIPPINGBITION INHATION TO THEiLIBD fOOD106RAMME.(4)    The Cabinet had before them a joint Memorandumby the Food Controller and Lord Crawford on the shipping position in relation to the Allied Food Programme,(CP.386) and a Memorandum by the Shipping Controller,(C.P.403).The Food Controller and Lord Crawford suggested the appointment of e Cabinet Committee to review theGovernment&quot;s shipping polioy in its relation,not onlyto British, but to Allied and&apos; Belief needs-     Thissuggestion arose out of a complaint by the French Gov-ernment of the diversion of tonnage (expected to beavailable for French needs) by the British Ministry ofShipping in order to meet the needs of.the Wheat Corn-mission.     According to the French authorities 135,000tons had been diverted from the French service.    Similarcomplaints had been made by the Italian Government.It was pointed out that the suggestions now being put forward implied the resumption of the control ofshipping on behalf of the Allies;    that we had not yet in faot given up the control of a single ship since theArmistice, but were still operating a licensing system;that the Shipping. Controller&apos; had been able to meet all-the demands made, upon him by the Food Controller and that!any delays in distribution of food were in faot due tocongestion at the docica, and lastly,.that the BritishGovernment had no responsibility for the ships whichI FUTURE OF (3)    With reference to Conclusion 6 of a ConferenceS ^SUPREMEitfOMIO COUHCIlV^J^d.^.,,^ovomb-er 18th, 1919, the Cabinet had beforethem a Memorandum by the Chancellor &quot;of the exchequer in regard to the- future.,j^f-..^^-3uprexxva-Economic Council( CP. 369).Th$ Qalsiaet agreed -rTo approve the proposals of theChancellor of the Exchequer, subjectto the Board of Trade and the ForeignOffice agreeing as to the future ofthe Communications.,.Section. (Appendix).
The Shipping Controller undertook to investigate the complaints made in the Memorandum by the FoodController and Lord Crawford with a view to allow-ing more ships to France and Italy if that were found possible..LTH (5)       With reference to Cabinet 15 (19) Minute 3, andiUEAIJCE.to the Mi nates of the 1st and 2nd Meetings of the Sub-Committee, it was agreed  To refer the two questions in dispute,viz. the contributions of the insuredpersons and the capitation fees of the doctors, for settlement to the follow-in^ Committee:-The Chancellor of the Exchequer:The Minister of Health:The Home Secretary:The President of the Board of Tradesat a meeting to be held in the TreasuryBoard Boom, on January 8th, 19 30, at 11.30 a.m.r-COHTROL OF        (6)       Tilth reference to Conclusion 1 of a ConferenceME-GROWN MEAT.held on December 9th, 1919, the Cabinet, had before thema Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries .:(CP.373), and a Memorandum by the Pood Controller (CP.384)proposing that the. control of British meat of all kindsshould cease on the same date as the control of milk, thusfreeing simultaneously all agricultural products exceptwheat.It was pointed out that prices had been fixed for home-grown meat up to July 4th, and that while there wouldbe pressure from the farmers that these prices should bemaintained, it was believed to be possible to persuade themto accept de-control without compensation.    In thisconnection the suggestion was made that the profits which-6- werehad beerr engaged&quot;by^-th^ time charter.It was urged that any policy which attempted torecognise a right on the part of France or Italy to security against interruption of the use of any british ships time chartered by them, would make the work of theMinistry of Shipping impossible.
RENEWAL OF (7)       The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the meat CONTRACTS.President of the Board of Trade (C.P.344), and a Memorandumby the Food Controller (CP.385), dealing with thequestion of the renewal of contracts for the purchase of meat in the Dominions and in South America.The Cabinet approved the proposals of the Presl-dent of the Board of Trade against the renewal of the contracts with the Plate Meat Companies and against thecontinuance of the present arrangements with the australian and New Zealand Governments, subject to the qualificationsset forth by the Food Controller, namely, (1) that arrange-ments are made for the shipment of. a sufficient quantityof beef from South America to meet United Kingdom require-ments, and.(:2) that our control of insulated tonnage ismaintained. .... &apos;. ... - -  &apos;&apos;   &quot;; - ( 8) HOME^*extr*T^Aing-^rb&apos;t^JU^ butchersat a price higher than that paid to the farmers from october 1st last to February, which would amount to betweenand 3 million pounds, should be allocated by the treasury to fhe Ministry of Agriculture and used for the improvementof live-stock.This suggestion was opposed as there were otherlosses on the trade in meat which might fall on theTreasury, and in :any case the decision as to de-control could be taken quite independently of the financial point.-It was reported at the Cabinet that strong opposi-tion to the proposal to de-control at this stage had beenmade by the Secretary for Scotland and the Chief Secretaryfor Ireland, v/ho were unable to be present.The Cabinet decided  .( 1)    To refer the question of de-controlwithout compensation to the Home AffairsCommittee, with instructions to settle the matter on behalf of the Cabinet, ata meeting to be held on Wednesday,January 14th:(2) To refer the proposal to use the profits of the Ministry of Food for the improvementof live-stock to the same Committee.
