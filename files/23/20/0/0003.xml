B &quot;RAILWAY (l) The-Gablne-t..had.-^afo-w &quot;them,-a.,-ftopy of correspondenceTUATION.whieh had taken place between the General-Secretary of thenational Union of Railwaymen and the Minister of Transport,(CP.433), and a Memorandum by the Secretary to the Ministryof Transport summarising the history of the negotiationswhidh had taken-ple.ce with the National Union of Railwaymanfrom October 1914 to the present time (CP.435).The Minister of Transport reminded the Cabinet thatthe&apos;recent Railway Strike had occurred on the refusal ofthe Railwayman to accept as a minimum anything less thanthe addition of the full war wage added to the maximum pre-war wags.     They wished to standardise on the basis of thehighest rate paid by any Company.in any grade plus the war wage.     The Government were confronted with the task of fixing, in abnormal conditions-, a standard seals of wagessuitable for normal conditions.     Both sides were agreedthat peace could not be secured without standardisation,but the government proposal had been to take the averageas against the maximum of each grade, to add to it the war wage of 33/-, and a further sum of 5/- per week, correspond-Ing to a similar sum which had been awarded to the Engineer-Ing Trades from December last.     This award embraced theRailway-shopmen.     This temporary consolidated wage,fixed in abnormal conditions, the Government proposed shouldcorrespond to a cost of living level of 125$ above thepre-war figure and should rise and fall from October 1920at the rate of 1/- for each five points.     Inasmuch as an advance of l/- per week above the 33/- costs the nation 1,000,000, the advance of 5/- would cost  5,000,000, andit had been necessary for the Minister of Transport to ask the Rates Advisory Committee, in view of the course of negotiations, to budget for this additional  5,000,000.The negotiations on behalf of the National Union of railwaymen had been conducted by Mr.J.H,Thomas, Mr.CP.Crampand Mr.Wilson, and they had acoepted the terms of the-V- Governments
Government&apos; s offer, end had pledged themselves - to recommendthem favourably to the delegates,  and all information avail-   *able showed that they were carrying out their pledge.     the delegates, however, at their special General Meeting, had rejected the Government1s offer.      That afternoon a deputation from the Railwayman, led by Mr. J.H.Thomas, had waited on theMinister of Transport and the Minister of Labour and had putforward the demands of the General Meeting.      They emphasisedtwo special objections to the Government&apos;s offer, (1) they stood for the maximum as against the average on each grade,(2) they objected to a sliding scale dependent on changes inthe cost of living.It was pointed out to the Cabinet that to depart fromthe principle of the average would not only be extremelycostly, but i,t would disturb the&apos;proper relations betweenthe various grades and lead to a fresh group of anomalies.Further this was the essential issue on which the strike had been fought and if the Government yielded on it now, theywould be giving away the advantages gained by the terminationof the Strike.With regard to the men&apos;s objections to the sliding scale,  the Deputation had put forward no alternative butthat of &quot;peaceful persuasion&quot;..     They doubted the accuracy of the Board of Trade figures and in any case preferred that the discussion of wage differences should continue tofollow the present procedure.       In addition to these two main issues, the Deputation called attention to theimportance of making a settlement with Irelsnd, of dealingwith certain odd grades, and with cases of genuine individualhardship, and of giving a wide interpretation to the promise that the settlement should be retrospective.It was explained by the Minister of Transport thatit would probably materially assist those who were working for a settlement among the men, if the principle of theEnglish

So far as he and his advisers were ableto Judge the situation, /there was no likelihood of animmediate strike, nor any evidence that at the moment therewas any strong concerted action op the part of the Railwaymanwith the other members of the Triple Alliance.(l) The Cabinet expressed their complete concurrencewith the Conclusions reached by their colleagues In Paris on January 11th, 1920, viz:-(a) To adhere to the principle of the average rate as against the maximum basic rate:(b) To adhere to the principle of the sliding scale varying with the cost of living:(c) To extend the principle of the Governmentsoffer to Ireland;(d) To deal sympathetically with odd grades andcases of individual hardship:(e) To meet as far as possible the claims of themen in respect of retrospective payment --the difference being one of machinery ratherthan of principle.(2) The Cabinet further approved the statement madeby the Minister of Transport as to what hadtaken place at the Deputation-(2) The Cabinet agreed to entrust the drafting of theGovernment reply to the Deputation, on the linesof the above Conclusions,to the Minister ofTransport and the Minister of Labour, and authorised them to make such communications tothe Press as they might think desirable.
