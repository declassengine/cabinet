ICabinet resumed the^-^^iij^ruaaixu^^ at the morningmeeting, on Russian Policy.The trend of our policy was summed up towards the endof the meeting in the following sense(a) There can be no question of making activewar oh the Bolsheviks, for the reason thatwe have neither the men, the money, nor the credit-, and public opinion is altogetheropposed to such a course.(b) There can be no question of entering intoPeace negotiations with the Bolsheviksuntil they have demonstrated their oapao-ity to conduct an orderly,  decent admin-istration in their own country and their intention not to interfere, by propagandaor otherwise, in the affairs of their neighbours, nor until they can show thatthey represent the governing authorityof the areas for which they claim to 3peak.A hint might be given to the Bolsheviksin a public speech that when they haveaccomplished this, and only then,  should we be prepared to treat with them.(0) The Border States surrounding Russia mustthemselves take the full responsibilityfor deciding as between peaoe and war.Not the slightest encouragement, however,should be given them to pursue thepolicy of war, because if we were togive that advice we should incur respondsibilities which we could not discharge,She Prime Minister&apos;s statement to       Patekto this effeot on January 27 (h&amp; Lm&amp;&amp;&amp;)was approved.(d) We should continue our policy of givingmaterial support to enable the Border1      states to defend themselves if attacked by the Bolsheviks.

PANAMA, at Malta,  should,
if the Governor found it practicable, be landed at Oomino Island.NQTB*    Immediately after the Meeting, afurther telegram was received from theGovernor of Malta, to the effect thathie project for landing the infectedoases on Comino Island was not feasible,and that he proposed to utilise the S.S.PANAMA as a hospital ship for the caseson board.    After consulting Admiral lord beatty, the Prime Minister&apos;approved thata telegram should be sent by the ActingSecretary of State for the Colonies tothe Governor of Malta, in the sense thathis proposal was approved provisionally,but that the question must be examinedclosely in its medical aspects, in viewof the risk of overcrowding on board theship.(4) The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the first sea Lord, dated January 28, 1920, in regard to the evacuation of refugees from South Russia and Russian prisoners of war from Germany (Paper C.P.-519).The Cabinet agreed --That the S,S, CHRISTIAN NEBE, now at Malta,which was reported to be overcrowded andthreatened with typhus,  should be ordered to proceed to a Russian port.(5) With reference to Cabinet 4 (20), Conclusion 2 (c),attention was drawn to the opinion expressed by the Cabinet,during the Prime Minister&apos;s absence in Paris, that thegarrison of Batura should be withdrawn at the earliest possi-ble moment when it appeared desirable to do so on military grounds,It was explained that during the discussions in Paris,at which it had been decided to give material support to theTranscaucasian States, the moment had been considered inoppor-tune for withdrawing the garrison of saturn.(6) The Secretary of State for War handed in a Note inregard to the British Mission in South Russia, prepared inreply to certain criticisms made by Sir Halford Msckinder atthe morning meeting.The Secretary was instructed to circulatethis Note.

A-P. appendix.Cypher Telegram to Sir H. Rumbold (Warsaw).Foreign Office,  January 27,  1920, 11,45 p.a.No.46  (R).Yesterday M. Patek had an interview with the Prime minister on the subject of the Bolshevik offer of Peace to Poland,    The&quot;Prime Minister stated formally to M. Patek that while it was not for Great Britain to advise Poland, which must take the full responsibility for deciding as between peace and war, the BritishGovernment certainly did not advice war.    He then explained to M.Patek the situation as he saw it. .Six months ago there was aB&quot;eat converging movement against Bolshevism including Koltchak,Denikin, Poland, the Baltic States, Finland, and the British at archangel.    Poland at that time was only a unit in a great combln-ed movement pressing the Bolsheviks on all sides.    Now, on theother hand, Poland was alone.    The Allies had withdrawn fromRussia,    Koltchak had disappeared.    Denikin had been defeated.Esthonla had made an armistice, and,  if his information was cor-rect, Latvia intended to follow suit immediately.    There was clearly, therefore, grave risk that Roland might be left to face a Bolshevik concentration by itself. &apos; The Prime Minister,  there-fore, wished to make it perfectly clear to the Polish Governmentthat the British Government did not wish to give Poland the slightest encouragement to pursue the policy of war because if itwere to give that advice it would incur responsibilities which itcould not discharge.The Prime Minister then gave certain reasons for hisopinion that Bolshevism constituted a serious military menaceoutside its own borders.    The danger from its propaganda was perhaps as great as ever, but he did hot believe that it would bepossible for the Soviet authorities to organise a really formidable-able army for offensive purposes against the West, while therewas reason for thinking that the revolutionaries were becomingafraid of the military instrument they had created.   A militarycoup d&apos;etat in Russia might be a very formidable menace to Poland,He did not think that the Bolshevik armies, in view of the greatdesire of the population for peace, now constituted a militarymenace against any well-organised State.    Their transportation and manufacturing resources were not sufficient to admit of greatoffensive operations.    In addition there was nothing in the shape of food or raw materials to attract an army to march into, Poland,Hungary or Germany,The conversation then turned upon the character of apossible peace between Poland and Russia.   The Prime minister made It clear that in hi3 opinion the principal difficulty wouldbe the fact that the Polish armies had advanced far beyond theracial boundary into considerable territories which containedlarge Russian majorities.   The Prime Minister said that if thePoles made a sincere attempt to make an equitable peace and theBolsheviks either refused peaoe or,having made peace, proceeded to repudiate it, Great Britain would feel bound to assist poland to the best of its power.    He was sure that it would be possibleboth for the French and British Governments to rouse their people,exhausted as they were by five years&apos; war, to make fresh effortsif Poland had made a sincere attempt to make peace on fair terms and the Bolsheviks rejected it and attacked Poland instead.    If,on the other hand, Poland Insisted on retaining within Poland, ares which we-e Indisputably Russian according to the principles gener-any aoolied by the Peace Conference&apos;, and if the Bolshevik Covern-ment refused the peace on this Rround and attacked Poland in order
-2-to recover Russian districts for Russia, it would be very diffi-cult, if not impossible, for the British Government to get publicopinion to support military or financial outlay in these circum-s + ances.    The Prime Minister further said that the Allies intended,if possible, to re-establish trade relations with Russia throughthe Co-operative organisations partly because they believed thatthis was the best method of bringing peace and mitigating Bolshev-ism in Russia and partly because Russian sources of suoply of food and raw materials were essential to the feeding of Europe and the bringing down of prices.    The British Government did not wantPoland, which was itself short of food and raw materials, to main-tain an economic barrier through warlike operations between itself and Russia while the Allies were themselves trading to the best of their ability with the Russian people.Finally the Prime Minister said that Gv,eat Britain enter-tained feelings of the most sincere friendship for Poland, and itwas in the spirit of this friendship that he felt bound to makeperfectly clear to the Polish Government at once what was theBritish attitude towards the whole question.    The responsibility of deciding between peace and war was one which must be taken by thePolish Government alone, but he thought that it was essential thatthe Polish Government should know fully the mind of the BritishGovernment before it took its decision.   Hence the declarationswhich he had just made.In reply M. Patek asked two questions-.    In the first placehe nointed out that the Soviet Government was not recognised bythe Allies nor by great sections of Russian opinion,   Would theAllies guarantee any peace made with Soviet Russia, fur under existing circumstances there was nothing to prevent either theSoviet Government itself-, which was not &quot;a djg, jure, Government under international law, or its successor from repudiating any Treaty it made.    The Prime Minister replied that it was obviously impossiblefor the Allies to guarantee a Treaty or to go beyond the generalguarantees contained in the Covenant of the League of Nations. Thls^difficulty was inherent in the existing state of affairs, and itwas really a question of the balance between the risk of makingpeace with an unstable Government and the risk of war.    Secondly,M. Patek asked whether the P*iae Minister&apos;s declarations were those,of all the Allies.    To this the Prime Minister replied that they represented, in the first place, the deliberate decision of theBritish Government, and that he could inform M. Patek that SignorNitti entirely agreed with them.   As to M. Millerand, the PrimeMinister had not&quot; discussed the question with him, because M, Mille--rand had not had time to get into office.    He was pretty confident,however, that France and the Supreme Council, &apos;when it came toconsider the question, would take the same attitude as he had justoutlined.    In conclusion, the Prime Minister expressed the hopethat Poland would be able to settle its controversies with lithuania-a*ria at an early  date and peacefully, and that Poland would take no action against. Lithuania without in the first instance bringing the matt*- bpfo-e the Supreme Council.    M. Patek agreed,  remarking,that he did not anticipate serious difficulty in arriving at anagreement.The interview was most friendly and cordial-throughout.
