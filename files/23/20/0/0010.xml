(1) The attention of the Cabirurt^-vrtvs drwrnto the- draft conclusions of the Finance Committee (F.C.  19th Minutes,Conclusion 3), where the following decision is recorded:-- r.&quot;&quot;The immediate and entire withdrawal of theforce of approximately 1,700 men under GeneralMalleson,  formerly at Meshed and now atBir^and,  together with the troops hn their line, of commurd^oarti-ono in Seistan&quot; kIt was suggested that the above record did not cor-reotly interpret the &apos;intentionsthe -Finance Committee,which were that the Government of India should be consultedboth as to the coat of the force and as to the policy before a final decision was taken.The Prime Minister stated that, according to his reoollection, the draft Minute quoted above was correct.    He had understood that the intention of the Finance Committee wasto compel the Indian Government to protest if they disapprove-of the policy of the withdrawal.    Should they insist on theretention of these forces, they should then be asked toundertake the cost of their maintenance..The President of the Board of Education, who is aotinfor the Secretary of State  for India in his absence,  statedthat the India Office telegram to the Government of India,which had been despatched before the receipt of the draft conclusions of the Finance Committee, had stated that theCabinet desired to know the views of the Indian Governmenton the subject.    It might be assumed, therefore,  that be/foreffect was given to the Finance-Committee&apos;s decision the vi of the Government of India would be available.
rjOAl POLICY.        (-3)    with r-eferenoe to Cabinet 8,  Conclusion 9, and appendix IV, the question of the Government&apos;s policy in -regard to coal mines was. -r&amp;ieed as a question of urgency inview of an amendment to the Address to be moved by theLabour Party in the House of Commons on the sane afternoon.In this connection the Cabinet had before them the following documents:-A Memorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade, covering a revised draft of the Coal Mines EmergencyBill (Paper CP.-513) :A Summary of the Ministry of Mines 311ljcirculated during the meeting  (paper c.P.-6G4):A Report on the Coal Industry,  furnished by the Independent Acooimtant selected by the Government (Pafoer CP,-583),After a full discussion it was agreed  That the Prime Minister&apos;s statement inthe House of Commons should be baaed onthe following lines:-(a) Acceptance of the principle of a special 3-overnmenJ?r^a?J?a^io^U of Mines as desired botht^o&quot;1    6 COn  i    ky mine-ownero and miners.    The estab-lishment of a new Ministry was generallydeprecated, and the plan of a Sub-Depart-ment of tho Board of Trade on the linesof the Department of Overseas Trade,  orof the Blockade Department during the War,under the immediate control of a&quot;specialParliamentary under-Secretary, was gen-erally preferred.(b) The powers of the new Sub-Department ofMine3 to be on the general lines proposedby the President of the Board of Trade(Paper CP.-604).    These,  however, werenot examined in detailj and one point,namely * the question of transferring tothe new Sub-Department the powers inregard to the safety of the mines, wasexpressly reserved,-at the request of theHome Secretary,.for further consideration.(c)The powers of the new Sub-Department should extend to coal and to all minerals worked in the  same shafts as coal, but not toother minerals worked in separate mines.(d) The adoption of the following suggestionsrecently made to the Prime Minister byrepresentative mine-owners, which havealready been accepted by the Cabinet asa reasonable basis for further negotia-tion between the mine-owners and miners(Cabinet 8, Conclusion 9,  and Appendix TV,Conclusion 1):-
&quot;CQ-^As long as abnormal conditionscontinue, the QovedmnieJit shallbe equipped, with the neo**asarystatutory powers *--(a) To equalise profits in the coalindust ry:(b) To control the-quantity of ooalavullahis. .for export:(c). To restrict prices of coal forthe home market.(ii) That in the arrangements for thecomputation of profits adequateinducements should be afforded to economical production anddevelopment *,(n.b. The third proposal of the mine-owners was in favour of aMinistry of Mines, as indicated above in paragraph (a)   ).In connection with (ii) above, the sug-gestion was made that the profits acc.ru-ing to the State from the control of theexport trade in the present year might with advantage be hypothecated to thepurchase of the mineral rights in coal,thus avoiding the increased wage demands which would result if these profits were returned to the mine-owners.    The pro-posal was generally assented to, but theChancellor of the Exchequer asked thatno final decision should be taken infavour of the principle of purchasingthe mineral rights in coal by a lump sum payment.(e) The policy approved by the late WarCabinet on August 14,  1919 (Paper GaT7934 B.) and subsequently communicatedto the house of Commons by the PrimeMinister, should be re-stated ao faras it is still applicable&quot;,    that is tosay, in regard to  The purchase of mineral rights by theState:The deduction from the purchase   price for mineral rights in England and Walesof a sum equal&apos;to the capital value rfan annual rate at least equal to theaverage rates now levied in Scotlandupon the revenue from minerals inScotland&apos;.The application of the deduction referredto to social amelioration to the miners.Rejection of State purchase and Statemanagement of collieries,&quot;Among the conditions of any satisfactoryorganisation of the Coal Industry in thiscountry, the Government hold:-(1) That a reasonable standard of livingshould be secured to the miners and
ttheir families, that the deplorablehousing conditions now prevailing insome of the coalfields of the country should be remedied as rapidly as pos-sible, and that every effort shouldbe made to improve the comfort and amenities of the Industry.(2) That in view of the fact that the lives and livelihood of the miners depend onthe way in which the mines are worked,means should be devised for securing their co-operation in the shaping ofthe general conditions of the Industrywithout interfering with the executivecontrol of individual mines.(f) The remainder of the conditions for the organ-isation of the ooal industry announced lastAugust to be dropped:    that is to say, those relating to the grouping of the coal mines inthe various areas (Paper G.Ti-7924 B, para,4,sub-paras. 3 to 6).    This was felt to be lnevit-able,  in view of their rejection by both mine-owners and miners.(g) The substitution for the system of groupingmines in areas,  of the following organlsa-tions proposed by the President of the Boardof Trade:-(i) Pit, 0pmmlttees.. which, at meetingsregularly held, may discuss and make proposals, in regard to:-Safety and Health,Conditions of &quot;Jorking,Improvements in Methods,Comfort and well-being ofthe Workers while at Work,Disputes other than Wages Disputes.(ii) District Committees,  on which labour would be represented both by workmenand Trade Union agenta4. the committees to deal with:-Questions referred to them fromthe Pit Committees and similartypes of questions that have adiet riot bearing:Labour disputes of all kinds,except that if the question isa national one it would be re-ferred to the National Committee:Questions which at present go before the District ConciliationBoard or Minimum Wages Board:
,   ..      . 131Questions - referred to them by theNational Committee in regard to thedistribution of surplus profits.(iii) .A,Mati^nal Mining. Cpramittee* with thefollowing funct ions T-Any question of national interestaffecting the industry referred toit by the Minister:Labour questions having a nationalbearing,  or questions referred tothem by the District Committee:National wages questions:Formulation and administration fordivision of returns from the industry:(1) It is probable that the working out of the scheme in Districtswould be referred by the national committee- to the District Committees.(S) In order to carry out this functionthe National Committee will requireto have access to information as to cost of production.The District Committees may requireto have access to similar informa-tion for their district.(3) While the ab^ve scheme went as far as the cabinet were able to go in the limited time at their disposal, itwas generally recognised that the system of Pit Committees,District Committees and National Mining Committee would not satisfy the aspiration of the miners for an effective voice in the general direction of the pits.    In the-  scheme annoured last August this aspiration had been provided for by including Directors representing the workers in and aboutthe mines on the body controlling the policy of the AreaGroup to which they belong.    The rejection of this schemeOf grouping the mines leaves each mine under separatemanagement,  and this renders the association of miners inthe management far more difficult.    It, was generally recognised that further consideration would bo requiredto this aspect of the problem^ whioh was reserved forfurther consideration.
ttr,VEROolnageBill.(4) The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to a decisionof the Cabinet Committee on Finance &quot;authorising the Chancel-lor of the Exchequer to reduce the fineness of silver coinageto 60C/1000ths,  or below, if on enquiry he found a lower,standard practicable,  and,  in addition, giving the Chancellorof the Exchequer discretion to make the necessary arrangementsfor the issue of nickel coins,  subject to the passage of thenecessary legislation, if % on further examination,  he consider-ered that this course was unavoidable (Finance Committee, 18thMinutes, Conclusion 2).The Cabinet took note of,  and approved,the intention of the Chancellor of theExchequer to introduce the Coinage bill at an early date, as desired by theGovernment Whips.proposed inter-nationalFINANCIALCONFERENCE(5)- With reference to Cabinet 8 (20),  Conclusion 1, theCabinet had before them the following documents relating tothe international financial situation:-Report of a Conference at the Treasury(Paper CP.-580),Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,covering draft reply to Memorial(Paper CP.-583) .Note by the Chancellor of the exchequer covering telegraphic correspond-ence with Washington (Paper CP.-597).After a short discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the draft reply to the memorialpresented to the Prime Minister,  subjectto the slight amendment indicated below:(b) That the following passage  &quot;It is clear that the United StatesGovernment could not be represented at  such a Conference&quot;  should be modified in the sense that&quot;The attitude of the memorialistsindicates that it is doubtfulwhether the United States Govern-raent could be represented at sucha Conference&quot;.-6-
(6) With reference to Cabinet 7 (20), Conclusion 5,the attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the followingCorKiluei^ria-^f^a-K^ hoii^m--?ebraiary 3,  1920,Conclusion 3 :-&quot;Xt was agreed  That the War Office should be authorisedto take steps to evaluate Datum whenever they should oo-naider this  desirable andopportune,,It was further agreed  That Constantinople was vital to us, andthat every endeavour must be made to on-sure that we should continue in controlof the city and its environments&quot;.In this connection the Cabinet ha-d before them aMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(Paper CP.-594) asking that the  Cabinet should refrain frominsisting upon the decision for the evacuation of Saturnheing carried out.The Cabinet were reminded that on the previous day the Prime Mlnioter had stated in the House of Commons thatthe British forces were being rapidly withdrawn from Batum.It was pointed out that these two decisions wereinterdependent,    The War Office had the responsibilityfor ensuring the vital condition that we should continue in control of the City of Constantinople and its environments.Subject to their fulfilling this responsibility, they hadbeen given some latitude in regard to the moment to be selected for the evacuation of Datum.    In any case theevacuation would require two or three weeks to accomplish.It was agreed  That the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff should confer with the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs in regardto the moment selected for the evacua-t ion.

The Conference had under consideration the following
it-face,  and as to the method by which itxjshould be met,the Conference reached the following conclusions ;-,(l)    That the situation was not  sufficiently graveto warrant the Government adopting ascheme such as that proposed in the appendix to the Memorandum by the Minister of Transport(CP. 490),   especially having regard to thefact that Some eight or ten Battalions more were available than when the Home Officesuggestion was put forward.(2)    That &amp; Committee should be appointed togo into the question of the safe keepingof weapons and in particular (l) toascertain the distribution of lethal weaponsthroughout the country,  (2) to make recommendations as ta the measures forguarding them, and (3) to make recommenda-tions as to the.best method for making them available to loyalists in the *?vent -efany emergency.    The Committee to be com-posed of the following : -Sir JTeVil Macready (Chairman) and representatives ofAdmiralty,Air Ministry,Ministry of Munitions, and war Office.(3)    That the Home Secretary should consider thesuggestion that a system of licensing shouldbe introduced to enable the loyal citizensto carry fire-arms and should report hisopinion to the Cabinet.(4)    That the Secretary for Scotland should beauthorised to summon a Meeting of the chief constables of Scotland to discuss with them the means that should be taken beforehandfor meeting industrial or revolutionarydisturbances by way of the preparation oflists and the formation of a skeletonand secret organisation by chief Constables.(5)    The Committee took note of the statement made by the Home Secretary that so far as england and Wales were concerned,  theHome Office had already explained to theChief Constables the urgency for the recruiting of an emergency force and thenature of the steps to be taken.
2.    The Conference had under consideration thefollowing   papers :-Memo: by the Chairman of the Supply and transport committee    (CP. 501)Memo; &quot;by the Chancellor of the Exchequer v(CP.  006) .Memo; by the Minister of Munitions.    (CP.517)regarding a suggested permanent organisation for meetings trikes.The Conference came to the: following conclusions  :-(1)    To approve the schemes outlined inAppendices A. and B. of the Memorandumdated 26th January, by the Minister ofTransport.  (C .P .  5Ql)(2)    To approve the expenditure involved inth e em e rg ency s ch etnes vi z: -Initial  25,388Annual .  105,240Surplus Stores(value of storesretained fromdisposal)  461,296.(3)    That the expenditure in question shouldbe charged on the Home Office Vote.3.    The Conference had under consideration a Memorandumby the Minister of Transport  (C.P.503)  asking that theSupply and Transport Committee and ito Sub-Committeeshould be dissolved,   that consideration of outstanding questions should be left to the Ministers concerned,and that responsibility for giving effect to cabinet decisions already taken should be placed on theDepartments concerned.The Minister of Transport stated that owing to pressure of wor?  it had. been very difficult to summonMeetings of the Committee;  that in his opinion theMinistry of Transport was loss generally concerned *
with the propos ed emergency organisation than some other *Departments, and that his connection with the committee as Chairman seriously prejudiced his departmental work as Minister of Transport.    He also urged that ministers should share the responsibility for the emergency organisation, and that, at the present he felt the tendencywas to lea^e to him, as Chairman, too great a share of theresponsibility*Some discussion then ensued during which It waspointed out that tho experience of the Minister of Transport,as Chairman of the Strike Committee and of its successor theSupply and Transport Committee, was invaluable; that the struggle-would begin probably with transport questions and that itwould very largely centre round the problem of maintaining the transport services of the country,,    It was considered essential that the Committee should, not dissolve and that theChairman should, moreover, have the personal support of other ministers concerned.    It was impossible to say whether theindustrial trouble would come to a head, but the Governmentshould be prepared in any case and Ministers should give their personal attention to the details of the organisation for meeting it.    A great impression had been made on the public the last time by the perfection of the government&apos;s organisation,and it would be very serious if in the next strike theGovernment did not live up to that high standard.
The Conference accordingly agreed -(1)    That the Supply and transport committee and its Sub-Committeeshould not be dissolved but shouldcontinue in existence for anothertwo months, at the end of whichthe question would be reconsidered.(2) That the First Lord of the Admiralty,the Secretary of State for War and theSecretary for Scotland should be addedto the Committee.(5) That the members of the Committee should use every endeavour to be presentpersonally at the Meetings, and to give their personal attention to theworking out of departmental schemes,and that they should share with theChairman responsibility for theGovernment&apos;s arrangements for meeting industrial disturbances.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.

jOtfSTANTINOJPLE. ($)   The Conference had before them a copy of a telegrammmPosition from General Milne, Constantinople, to the War Office, dated j,f Generaljdlne. January 29th, 1920 (Paper CP.-538),-r It was explained that the present situation was the culmination cf a line of conduct which had been consistentlyadopted %f. $oxiarsl Franchet d?Esperey, designed to place thelatter in control of Constantinople,   The French &quot;Generalf latest move was to withdrew two or three more French Bnttal-ions from General Milnefa Command, his object being to dimln-Ish&quot; the forces under the British Commander, so that, in the-event of a serious outbreak, General Milne would not be ableto act direct and he would have to appeal to General Fr&amp;nchetd?Ssperey to save the situation.It trae suggested that a simple way to counteract themanoeuvre was for General Milne to Inform the French Commanderthat he had no objection to.these Battalions being taken awayso long as due notice was given. In order that British orIndian Battalions might be brought in to replace them.

CONSTANTINOPLE.

The Position of General Milne.

(3) The Conference had before them a copy of a telegram from General Milne, Constantinople, to the War Office, dated January 29th, 1920 (Paper C.P.-538).

 It was explained that the present situation was the culmination of a line of conduct which had been consistently adopted by General Franchet d&apos;Esperey, designed to place the latter in control of Constantinople.  The French General&apos;s latest move was to withdraw two or three more French Battalions from General Milne&apos;s Command, his object being to diminish the forces under the British Commander, so that, in the event of a serious outbreak, General Milne would not be able to act direct and he would have to appeal to General Franchet d&apos;Esperey to save the situation.

 It was suggested that a simple way to counteract the manoeuvre was for General Milne to inform the French Commander that he had no objection to these Battalions being taken away so long as due notice was given, in order that British or Indian Battalions might be brought in to replace them. In the meantime, our Foreign Office might make the strongest representations to the French Government regarding the attitude of the French Commander.

 Attention was drawn to the fact that quite recently some 80,000+ rifles, with a number of machine-guns, had been raided from Gallipoli, where they had been under French guards, and smuggled across to the mainland. It was suggested that this occurrence afforded an admirable basis for the representations of our Foreign Office to the Quai d&apos;Orsay.

 It was agreed --

 That whoever was responsible for the security of the above arms was guilty of culpable negligence and ought to be moved from his Command: but that it was essential, before our Foreign Office moved in the matter, that the War Office should fix definitely the responsibility; and that, if it were found that the responsibility attached to General Franchet d&apos;Esperey, the French Government should be pressed strongly for his immediate removal.

 It was further agreed --


That, in order tc oreirent similar raids inthe f^ure, the flar Office should consult with tUo Admiralty with a view to thelat-er^ co-operation.Inn connection vri%n the above discussion it was&apos;pointed;out that If the French Battalions were removed from Constanti-nople they could only be replaced by British or IndianBattalions from Batoum; and that this raised the whole ques-tlon of our evacuation of this port,,    The desirability was strongly urged of our withdrawing from Bafcoum before we were driven out, which might mean a repetition of the French debacleat Odessa.. It was agreedThat the War Office should be authorisedto take steps to evacuate Batoum whenever they should consider this desirable andopportune.Jonstantincple. &apos; It was further agreedThat Constantinople was vital to us, andthat every endeavour must be made to ensurethat we should continue in control of thecity and Its environments.iIR ARCHIBALD     (4)    With reference to War Cabinet 217, Minute 18, the&apos;[URRAY1S$PATCH.       Conference had before them a Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for War (Paper CP.-483) regarding the further applies--tion of General Sir A.J. Murray, formerly Chief OfficerCommander-In-Chief, Egyptian Expeditionary Force, for per-mlssion to publish in extenso his original despatch from egypt,  dated June 28, 1917.It was explained that when the War Cabinet decided in1917 that the first part of the despatch, dealing with policy,could not be published their decision rested on two grounds(a) the one political, viz., that the first portion of thedespatch reflected upon the War Cabinet, and (b) the other military, viz., that other portions of the despatch might give valuable information to the enewv.   x% was represented that the latter ground no longer existed*
It        pointed out that the Conference had to weighthe disadvantage, en the one hand, of allowing a publicationwith its reflections upon the War Cabinet, with a possibilityof General Murray accusing the Government of deliberatesuppression of unpalatable facts.      The question also aroseas to whether It was desirable to allow reflections on StatePolicy to&apos;-be published long after the event without explana-tions;    and that the   Government wore placed in the dilemmaeither of sitting down under an ex parte (though possibly notvery damaging) statement, or of entering   upon a not verydignified controversy.It was agreedTo leave the matter in the hands of thePrime Minister, who undertook, afterreviewing the documents, to communicatehis decision to the Secretary of Statefor War.In order to assist the Prime Minister,the Secretary was instructed to place the relevant War Cabinet decisions in parallel columns with the statements inGeneral Murray1s despatch.OF (5)    With reference to War Cabinet 621, Minute 18, theDIALS INICALSISI- Conference had under consideration a Note by the SecretaryEE-oh.     of State for War (Paper C.Pe-427) covering a Memorandum bythe Master-General of the Ordnance asking for a cabinet decision on the use of animals in chemical warfare research the Home Secretary stated that his Department would consult the Law Officers of the Crown as to whether the useof animals for the purposes of such experiments was ooveredby the Vivisection Act.The general trend of opinion was to support the previous decision of the War Cabinet, that, as no other Power gaveany indication of ceasing the employment of asphyxiatinggases in warfare, the War Office should continue its gasorganisation, without denouncing the Land vvar Convention andthe Declaration of 1907, so far as this tied our hands inthe matter of gas,
It was agreed -That no decision should be taken untilthe Government were in possession ofthe considered opinion of the LawOfficers of the Crown on the point raised by the Home Office.2 FTixLtehail Gardens e S*W.l.3rd February, 1920.

DISABILITY PENSIONS COMMITTEE.

 1. With reference to Cabinet 5 (20), Conclusion 3, that a Committee consisting of representatives of the Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry and Treasury, with Sir L. Worthington Evans as Chairman, should be appointed to consider the proposals of the Admiralty in regard to Disability Pensions, it was explained that Sir L. Worthington Evans had asked to be excused from acting as Chairman on the ground that his Department was not concerned with these pensions and that the question before the Committee affected mainly the Service Departments and the Treasury, and it was suggested that Mr. Stanley Baldwin should act as Chairman and that a representative of the Ministry of Pensions should be added as a Member of the Committee.

 The Committee decided :-

 That the Admiralty proposals should be referred to an inter-departmental Committee consisting of representatives of the Treasury, Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry and Ministry of Pensions, and that, in view of Sir L. Worthington Evans&apos; request, Mr. Stanley Baldwin, M.P., should act as Chairman.                                                                        SILVER COINAGE. 

2. The Committee had before them a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (F.C.-39) in which the question was raised of altering the standard of fineness of the silver coinage and of issuing nickel 6d. and 3d pieces.

 It was pointed out that the price of silver had for some time been continually rising owing to increased demands for currency and for export to China and it now stood considerably above melting point. It was therefore, no longer possible for the Mint to coin silver of the existing standard without a loss and it was profitable to melt or export existing silver coinage for bullion.


Lord Cunliffe&apos;s a Committee on currency and Foreign Exchange had been asked to consider the general position and they had submitted a special report, recommending:-

 (a) That the restrictions on melting and export of silver coins should be maintained.

 (b) That the Royal Mint should be enlarged.

 (c) That emergency 3/-, 8/6 and l/- notes should be printed for use if necessary.

 (d) That Nickel coins should be substituted for the present 6d. and 3d. pieces, which wear badly and require constant renewal.

 (e) Should alterations in coins of higher denominations than 6d. become necessary, the new coins should be as nearly as possible of the same weight and size as these now current.

 Action had been taken on the first of these Recommendations and the Committee were now asked to consider the two remaining points.

 It was explained that Lord Cunliffe&apos;s Committee had been pressed to consider whether it would not be better to issue notes than debase the silver coinage but careful enquiries showed that the issue of notes of low denominations would be very unpopular. To meet the situation, therefore, it was proposed (a) to reduce the fineness of the larger silver coins from 925 to 400/1000ths of pure silver and (b) to issue 6d. and 3d. pieces of pure nickel, which could easily be turned out at Woolwich.

 Some doubt was expressed whether the issue of small nickel coins was necessary. The reduction of fineness of the silver coinage could be defended on the ground that the coins would still has an intrinsic value fully equal to the pre-war equivalent and it would make no difference to the appearance of the coins. It would be advisable to avoid any risk of disturbing the public mind by issuing nickel.


On the other hand it was pointed out that silver was now three or four times its pre-war value and that the reduction in fineness proposed would not, in fact, go far enough to compensate for the rise in price, and it was suggested that the fineness should be reduced to 500 instead of 600. It was stated that there might be some technical difficulty in reducing the fineness to this extent, and this was one of the reasons why nickel coins were suggested for the smaller denominations.

 The question was raised whether the Mints in the Dominions would follow the same course as that adopted here, and it was stated that the Australian Mint had already made enquiry as to what the British Government proposed to do.

 The Committee decided:-

 1. To authorise the Chancellor of the Exchequer to reduce the fineness of silver coinage to 600/1000ths or below, if on enquiry he found a lower standard practicable.

 2. While they would prefer to avoid the issue of nickel coins, the Chancellor of the Exchequer should have discretion to make the necessary arrangements for the issue of such coins subject to the passage of the necessary legislation, if on further examination he considered that this course was unavoidable.

CORDITE FACTORY FOR THE NAVY AT HOLTON HEATH.

3. With reference to Finance Committee 16, Minute 8, the Committee, had before them the draft terms of reference proposed by the First Lord of the Admiralty for the Committee which it was agreed should be set up to consider the necessity of maintaining a special Cordite Factory for the Navy at Holton Heath. (F.C.34.)

 It was stated that no objection was taken by any of the Departments concerned, to these draft terms but that it would be desirable to add the words "and military" after "naval", in the first paragraphs.


The Committee decidedThat the First Lord of the admiralty should set up a Committee consisting ofLord Moulton (In the Chair ,if willing toserve), representatives of the Admiralty,War Offioe, Ministry of Munitions and twoor three civilians with the following termsof reference :-To report what will be the most economicaland efficient arrangements for the manufactureof naval and military cordite, and particularly as to whether it is practicable consistently with efficiency of naval and military supplies,to dispense with the ssaintenance of separateGovernment factories for the Navy and army requirements.In framing its recommendations the Committeeshould consider i-(a) the praotioability of adopting thanaval standard of cordite for Amypurposes j(b) the desirability of maintaining tiieaccessary power of expansion of output jand(o)   all other relevant facts *jHENT 4* The Ocjnn&amp;ttee took note of the memorandum oirculatedAIMS BYSB NATION- by the President of the Board of Trade (F.C37) In which AGAINSTGOVERN-    .lt was stated that the Board of Trade were settingup the necessary organisation to deal with all claims by British National against enemy Governments, and ,that they hoped very shortly to take over the filesheld by the Foreign Claims Office, as proposed by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (F.C3G).MENT3 g. The Committee considered the memorandum circulatedGERMANY. -by the President of the Board of Trade in regard to-investments in Germany (CP .252) *    It was pointed outthat German   firms wero offering highly attractiveterms for foreign capital and enquiries were being madeas to whether investments of this kind were consideredby the Government to be in the national interest or otherwitUJ
BGMM OFCOUMCIL OFftBAHOIAL0W1OBRS.The opinion was&apos;-expressed that such arrangements wouldveryUJcelyprore to bo of great -advantage to our nationaltrade, but the general feeling was that it was for private business men to decide how far they would take up such venturesand that the less the Government appeared as advisers the better.It was, however, strongly urged that the time had cometo give some definite encouragement to the re-opening oftrade relations with Germany.     Public sentiment stillappeared to regard it as unpatriotic to trade with Germanyand the change in the situation which followed on the con-elusion of Peace did not yet seem to be realised.     Now that peace had been declared, it-should be a real peace.     M. Klotshad already stated in the French Chamber that he would net payhigh prices to British manufacturers for goods whichcould be bought cheaply In Germany,     It was in our interests to see that the present German Government, which was anti-militarist, should be enabled to get firmly established andit could only do this If trade relations were freely renewed.The Committee decided t-That, while no definite opinion could be expressedby the Government In regard to investments ofBritish capital in German enterprises, na obstacleshould be put. in the way of such investments.6.     The Committee considered the Interim Report of theCouncil of Financial Officers, of which Mr. Stanley Baldwinwas Chairman (F.C 33) and also a Note by Sir Warren Fisheron that Report (F.C. 35).It was explained that the Report of the, Councilcontained      a number of recommendations In regard tothe status of Financial Officers in public departments the
the Bcope of their duties, departmental prooedureand organisation in financial matters, which were generally agreed.     Sir Warren Fisher1s Note was directed to four points(m)    the position of the Financial Officers in theAdmiralty, War Office and Air Ministry:(b) the neoessity of doing nothing in the caseof Civil Departments to impair tho posi ox on and authority of the Permanent Secretary as theofficial primarily responsible to ministers for economy in regard both to questions ofpolicy and to tho organisation for effeotingit.(c) the importance of the Principal EstablishmentOfficer as the effective agent of thePermanent Secretary for ensuring economy inall matters of staff, organisation, and machinery generally.(d) the method of appointment to higher posts inthe Civil Service.As regards the first point, the Council had recommendedthat the Financial Offioers in the Service department should be made members of their respective Boards.It was explained that this would result in placing the Financial Officers in those Departments in asuperior position to the Permanent Head, who was theSecretary of the Board of Council but not a member.Under this proposal, the Permanent Civilian Headwould be divorced from any Interest in financial control,which was the only sphere of administration in these departments in which the civilian element could naturallyclaim to have a definite say.    It was strongly urgedthat everything should be done to identify the permanent secretary in these Departments with responsibility forfinanoe.As regards the fourth point, it was suggested thatthe defeo ;s of organisation in public Departments,which had frequently come to light during the War,could
could be traced in many oases to tho inadequate considerationgiven to the.&apos;selection of the higher offioials in these departments and it was proposed that all., appointments toand removals from the following posts in each Office,-vis,,the Permanent Head of the Department, his Deputy, th*Principal Financial Officer and the Principal EstablishmentOfficer should be subject to confirmation by the PrimeHintster*The Committee decided -to approve the recommendations in tho fiepwt of thoCouncil of Financial Officers, subject to thefollowing amendments :-(a) that the Permanent Civilian Head of the service departments should be charged with the primary responsibility for finance and he should have thestatus of a full member of the Council or board(b) that the Principal Financial Officer in civil departments should continue to be. definitelysubordinate to the Permanent Head of theDepartment who is primarily responsible, underMinisters, for economy:(c) that in all matters of staff organisation and machinery the Officer held responsible for economy by the Permanent Head should bo thePrincipal Establishment Officer.(d) that the appointment, or removal, of Permanent&apos;  Heads of Departments, their Deputies,Principal Financial Officers and PrincipalEstablishment Officers should be confirmed by thaPriiae Minis tor before t&amp;fcing effect.Whitehall G-gardens, S.^.l?&apos; 30th January, 198$.
