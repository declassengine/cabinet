RY. (!) The attention of the Cabinet was called to recent information from Buda Pest, and particularly to telegramBo. 31?,,  dated June 1, 1920,  to the effect that the Frenchproposed to make a loan to Hungary of 260,000,000 francs,in return for which tho Hungarian railways and tobacco mcn-opoly will be handed over as a guarantee.    The French Gov-e-nment were also stated to have undertaken to assist inobtaining for Hungary admission to the League of Nations,and to use their influence to secure certain territorialadvantages to Hungary.It was observed that the issue of so large a loanwas hardly consistent with the weakness of the Frenchfinancial position,  on which the French Government have sostrongly insisted.The subject was adjourned pending thereceipt of more definite Information.POLICY     (2) With reference to Cabinet 53(20), Appendix III, theBLAND.Cabinet had before them a Report by the Irish Executive,in consultation with the Lord Chancellor and the lord president of the  Council,  in regard to the various ques-* ions referred to them, (Paper C. P.-1375) (See Appendix).The Cabinet discussed at some length the proposalembodied in the Report, that the restriction should beremoved by which a Court Martial, acting under the Defenceof the Realm Regulations,  has not the power to impose thecapital penalty.    The general vie- of the Cabinet was thattrial by a Court Martial composed, solely of military men was undesirable.The precedent of the Army (Courts of Enquiry) Act,1916, was cited..The Cabinet agreed  (a)  That a Bill should be drafted,  providingfc the appointment by the Irish Gove-tv-cjont of a&apos; special Tribunal,  composed ofthree persons, the President being a judge,, with porer tu try oases and to inflict the death penalty;    this Tri-bunal to sit without a Jury,  and noappeal from its verdict to be allowed:
feD in-(b)  Subject to (a) above, to approve theReport of the Irish Government and thei-colleagues of the British Government(Paper 0.P.-1575)  (See Appendix).fflWJZ W &quot;ith reference to Cabinet 27 (?,C),  Conclusion 8,  andj PRISON-Cabinet 33*(20), Appendix II (1),  the Cabinet had underconsideration the action to be taken in regard to Irishinterned prisoners who had succeeded in many cases in taking advantage of their release to hospital, after hunger-striking,to- escape, with the result that a large proportion were nowat large,   some of whom had returned to Ireland.    Although theIrish Government had the power to deport from Ireland and tore-arrest and re-dep^rt those who had succeeded in returning to Ireland,  the machinery of identification at their disposalat present did not enable them to prevent the return of thesemen from Great Britain to Ireland,  or to ensure their re-arrest.    This produced a situation which was humiliatingnot only to the Irish, but also to the British Government,The Cabinet agreed  (a) That it was important to prevent the returnto Ireland of men in prison,  or in hospital,sr at large in England, who had been concernedIn murder;    and that there was not the sameobjection to the return of political agitators:(b) That the Chief Secretary and his advisers should scrutinise the list of prisoners,in order,  so far as possible,  to discriminate between these two classes, with a view to the arrest and detention of the class concernedin murder:(c) That the Home Secretary and the Secretary forScotland should be  responsible for providingplaces of internment for, and carrying outthe wishes of the Irish Government in res-peot of, the deportees so long as theyremain in Great Britain:(d) That the Irish Government should endeavour,in oases where they thought  fit, to apprehendand to re-deport escaped internees who had succeeded in returning to Ireland:    that, inorder to give effect to the above, the formof the Deportation Order should be re-considered by the Chief Secretary for ireland in consultation with the Home Secretary:(e) That the Home Secretary should proceed to theappointment of the Advisory Committee to beset up under the Cabinet decision of May 12,1920 (Cabinet 27  (20),  Conclusion 8).
(4) With reference to Cabinet 23 A. (20), in the course-&apos;-&apos;Uedent      of ihar-pr^**e*limrUUKfurKJiorOr-^u^cffWUnTW^ &quot;7aa.de that,^ Treaty&quot;hvith a view to a comprehensive settlement of the present difficulties in Ireland, the time was approaching when theCabinet should consider the precedent of the &quot;KilmainharaTreaty&quot;&apos; and the possibility of reaching a somewhat similar arrangement with the Minn Fein leaders.The Cabinet generally agreed  That, before embarking on the conside-a-tion of any such step, it v/as necessaryfor the Government first to secure theupper hand in their policy of establish-ing law and order in Ireland.BD LEVY       (5) With reference to Cabinet 28 (2C),  Conclusion 7, thefl WEALTH.Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer covering the  Report of the Select Committee(White Paper 162) on tho Increase of War Wealth (Paper CP.-1319).The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave a summary ofthe Report,  and described more particularly the modifiedscheme prepared by the Board of Inland Revenue and favoured by the  Committee,  by which a sum of  500,000,000 could beobtained,   350,000,000 in the first two years after thepassing of legislation and the setting up of machinery,  andthe remaining  150,000,000 in the course of the ensuing tenyears.    It was assumed, unde- this scheme, that the ExcessProfits Duty would be reduced to 40 per cent.    The generalobject of such a levy would be:-(a) To make some approach to equalisationof War sacrifice in the field ofFinance:(b) To &quot;educe the War Debt as soon as pos-sible and at a time when money valueshad a close relation to the values pre-vailing when the debt was contracted:(c) To reduce the Floating Debt.It was explained that, inasmuch as the Government would haveto allow any levy on war wealth to be paid in Governmentbonds at issue price, the sou-ces available for the reductio
Of the PI rating Pocbt^oul-d. he- E.?iL. tanlo dia^niahed, and thatthe case for the levy was to that extent and in that senseweakened.The Chancellor&apos; of the Exchequer-,   continuing, made astatement of the views of the banking,  commercial and indus-trial interests,  of the working-classes, and of his own views.?&quot;6m the Chancellor&apos;s statement, and from other aourr.esof information given to the Cabinet, it was clear that, sub-subject to a few notable exceptions, the representatives ofbanking,  commerce and industry were, as a whole,  strongly opposed to a levy on war wealth, and were of opinion thatits adoption might even produce a grave financial panic.Stress was laid on the heavy burden of taxation now imposedsand it was not clear that over a period of years the taxation of war fortunes would raise more money than the present systemof Excess Profits Duty, which,  on the whole, met with less objection from the business community than would a capitallevy.On the other hand,  stress was laid on the political difficulty of defending the rejection of a scheme for taxing^the unpopular war profits which had been publicly declaredfeasible by a Select Committee of the House of Commons.    Itwould be difficult to meet the irmputation that the Governmentwas subject to the excessive influence of wa&quot; profiteers andthe big toonled interests.    There was a strong feeling, especially-cially among ox-Service men, that those who had come out ofthe War, not only with their lives but with increased wealth,were unduly fortunate and should be made to surrender some considerable part of their abnormal gains.    To fail to seizethis opportunity would put a very strong weapon of attack inthe hands of those parties in the State who were challengingthe whole capitalist system, whereas to impose the proposedlevy,  it was argued, would be to save that system while ac-knowledging that its accidental abuses must be remedied.^hall Gardens, The discussion was adjourned until&apos;*ie a,  1920.

CABINET.

COMMITTEE ON  IRELAND.

CONCLUSIONS of a Meeting held in the Lord Chancellor&apos;s Room at the House of Lords, S.W. on Monday, 31st May, 1920.

PRESENT:

The Lord chancellor 

The Lord President of tho Council.

The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.

The Chief Secretary for Ireland.

The Attorney-General for Ireland. General Sir Nevil Macready.

The following were also present:-

Sir John Anderson.

Sir Claud Schuster.

Sir Francis Greer.

The Committee in the first place considered the powers that can at present be exercised under the existing enactments for the prevention of crime and restoration of order, and in particular those given by the Criminal Law and Procedure Act, 1887, and the Defence of the Realm ?ts and the Regulations made under them. The Committee reviewed the provision made by former Irish Emergency Statutes with respect to courts martial, arrest and suspects, the carrying and importation of arms and the constitution of special civil courts. Upon a detailed analysis of the powers necessary for the purpose of dealing with the present emergency and an examination of those conferred by the existing statute Law and under the Defence of the Realm Regulations and a comparison of those Powers with those which could be  exercised if martial law were declared, the Committee came to the conclusion that in present circumstances the existing powers would be sufficient if strengthened by the/


conferment upon a court martial acting under the Defence of the Realm Regulations of the power to impose the capital penalty. Under the present law the power of a court martial to impose a capital penalty is confined to offences committed with the intention of assisting the enemy. The Committee recommend that this restriction should be removed and that a court martial should be authorised to impose a capital penalty in all cases in which, if the offence were dealt with by a civil court, that court would have power to pronounce sentence of death, and that legislation should be introduced for the purpose.

The Committee considered a proposal for legislation for securing the payment of the compensation awarded to persons who had suffered injury to the person or property, or to the personal representative of police officers and other persons who had been murdered. In several cases county councils against whom decrees for compensation have been made have refused to levy rates to raise the compensation, and it was proposed that power should be taken to intercept the payments to such councils from the Local Taxation (Ireland) Account and to apply the same in discharge of the compensation. A Bill for the purpose was considered and its introduction was recommended.

The Committee considered suggestions for setting up a form of blockade against disaffected areas by stopping postal and railway communications with those areas and restricting the movement of the population, but were of opinion that this course, whilst inflicting considerable injury to innocent persons, would be of doubtful efficacy in restoring order and would be likely to give rise to serious labour troubles which might not be confined to the disaffected areas or to Ireland.
