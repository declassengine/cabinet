E^eAs&amp;ent of-^tlie-H&amp;cxsKFti^ thaton Arrr^^U^rlori he fouhd that the increase in the LabourGazette Scale of the cost of living, involved by the increasein the-price. of -aoal^anc^J^n^d^by^ha Cabinet..,at-their previous-me-meeting, was not from 1^ to Z points, as. the Cabinet.had then been informed, but from Z\ to 4 points.   Beforeannouncing the increase he felt that the Cabinet^ ought to becognizant of this.    On the trans pert--$repeat of the increase,a^^p^eemen1^Jh^ui--b^ Trade andthe-Ministry of Transport.The Cabinet decided --That there was no alternative but to confirm their decision of May 6th. &amp;nregard to the inor^ase of coal prices,which the President of the Board of Tradewas authorised to announce in the House.of Gemroona that afternoon in the form ofQ/uoetion and Answer, as in^appendix 1*surplus pro-pits promexport coal.(g) With reference to Cabinet S5 (SO)Hjoncln^distribution--1^-d)--The President of the Board of Trade was authorised, in the event of Supple-roerrtaryQuestions, to state that in one form or another any surplus profits on export coal would go to the Exchequer.
DIAl^rS0RDERS.(3) W^t^L^si^^ thee ^mritsar   Cabinet.-had before them the Report of the Secretary of Stateoident. Jfor Indiana Cabinet Committee on Indian Disorders,  togetherport ofbinet Oom-   with a oP^rering--note by the Secretary of State for India(Paper CP.-1340).The Secretary of State for India reported to theCabinet that Brigadier-General Dyer had called at the india Office that morning and had stated that he had never been allowed to make his defence before the Home authorities,and had asked that the Cabinet might hear him before deciding the question.The Report? was discussed from the point of view bothof the text and of the form in which it should be dealt with.In regard to the text, certain suggestions were made and adopted, which are given below.In regard to the manner in which the Report was to bedealt with, the Committee&apos;s proposal was to furnish theGovernment of India by telegram with a complete text of theCommittee&apos;^ Conclusions as approved by the Cabinet, and toask the Government of India to set them out in the forefrontof their own Resolution as a pronouncement by His&apos; Majesty&apos;sGovernment;    the Government of India then proceeding todeal with any other matters not covered by the CommitteefsReport which they considered required treatment.It was explained that the text of the Conclusionshad already been telegraphed provisionally to the Governmentof India.This procedure was criticised on the ground thatthere was no precedent for dictating to the Government ofIndia that they should include the British Government&apos;views in a Resolution drawn up with the object of statingtheir own conclusions.    The Government of India, it waspointed out, were in an entirely different position fromthe Home Government, in this matter, since they had to
: 85deal with British civilian - and military opinion in India,which considered tfea.t., while, General Dyer might have cora-mittod errors of judgment, he had probably saved India froma. very - set-ions outbreak    The passage in the Cabinet Commit-tee*s Report dealing with Sir Michael 0&apos;Dwyer was in parti-cular cbntr^eted with %he corresponding passage in the -Government of India1 s1 draft Resolution, which actuallycommended that officer,    Tfte Government of India, it wassuggested, would be entitled, if thSy thought fit, to refuseto publish the views of the Home Government as part of theirown Resolution, leaving it to the British Government to make their own pronouncement.It was ex/plained, however, that the view   of theCabinet Committee did not really differ in substance fromthat of the Government of India.   It was rather a difference in the form of expression,   It was clear that the Governmentof India wished, if possible, to avoid a difference ofopinion with the Home Government, since they had taken theunusual cburse of sending the Resolution in draft.   The&apos;Cabinet felt, therefore, that it was quite open to theBritish Government to make a suggestion to the Governmentof India, and that this course would be preferable to theone proposed by the Committee.The Conclusions of the Cabinet were as follows:-&apos;(a) To approve the Report of the CabinetCommittee as representing the viewsof the Cabinet, subject to certaindraftihg alterations which were leftto be made by the Secretary of Statefor India on the following passagesPagsnift.. A translation or explanationto be given of the expression&quot;danda faug&quot;.?ace 4. tfcirq -paraftr^ah. beginning&quot;That Brigadier-General Dyerdisplayed% etc.   transfer the whole of this paragraphso as to follow the first  .paragraph on page 5.Amend this paragraph in thefollowing particulars

In order to avoidconveying the impression thatmartial law had been administeredgenerally and on a large scale *inthe spirit of an army of occupation in a hostile country&quot;, it should bemade clear in line 35 that thispassage applied only to     &quot;someofficers in the Punjaub&quot;, In lieu of &quot;officers&quot;.Page 9. The first paragraph, recording thattributes had been widely paid toSir Michael 0&apos;Dwyer, to be re-draftedso as to become a tribute to SirMichael 0&apos;Dwyer from the government itself.(b) On the question of procedure, the Secretaryof State for India should telegraph the revised text to the Government of India,and should inform that Government thatthe Cabinet had considered their draft resolution and, while agreeing in itssubstance, preferred a different mode of expression.   The Conclusions of the cabinet as telegraphed were, therefore, communicatednot as indicating a difference of opinion,but as an alternative wording on which theCabinet would be glad&apos; to receive the obser-vations of the Government&apos;of India.   Moreparticularly,, the Cabinet would like to beinformed whether the Government of india would propose to embody the Conclusionsof the Cabinet in their own Report, or to publish them separately.The Secretary of State for India undertook to circulate his telegram to the Cabinet,(c) It was generally agreed that, in view ofthe very full particulars available to theCabinet Committee in regard to the Amritsarincident, it wag unnecessary for the Cabinetto hear General Dyer himself.-4-
 URAL DRCO-RA-&apos;j?.ION. OP THE(4) The Cabinet.-had .,,be fore-them the foilowing&apos; documents?0^3IGN OFFICE, on the subject of the mural decoration of the ForeiMemoranda by the First Commissioner ofWorks (Papers CP.-630 andC.F.-l 42) :A Memorandum by the Secretary of stats for Foreign Affairs (Paper C.P.-1221).This question arose from the acceptance,  on May 7$1914, by lord Beauchamp, then First Commissioner of Tories,on behalf of the Government, of an offer by Mr SigismundGoetze to execute and present a series of panels tp beplaced at the top of the staircase at the Foreign Office.These panels, which had now been completed, were consideredby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who had consulted distinguished experts, to be unsuitable.    Thequestion before the Cabinet was as to what action should betaken in regard to these panels.After the Cabinet had dismissed the question at con-siderable length from the point of view both of the properattitude of the Government, as the recipient of unsuitableand inappropriate pictures, which, however, had actually been accepted by their predecessors, as well as of theartist, whose professional reputation would obviously be seriously injured by the rejection of work on which he hadlavished much time, energy and money, it was pointed outthat both the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and MrGoetze were willing to submit the matter to a Committee,and that the difference between them lay mainly in its composition.    Lord Curzon proposed a Committee composed ofthe Director of the National Gallery, the Director of theTate Gallery, the Director of the Victoria and AlbertMuseum, and a Royal Academy painter to be nominated by thePresident of the Royal Academy.    Mr Goetze suggested aCommittee nominated by the President of the Royal Academy.Office:

While it was urgedthat, -even---though aCommittee were appointed, the decision should rest with-theCabinet,  it was pointed out that the  Report of such a Com-mittee   las had been proposed would carry great weight with members of the Cabinet.In order to assist the Cabinet in deciding whether to settle the question themselves or to refer it to a Com-mittee,  it was agreed --That the First Commissioner of works should be authorised to place the wholeof Mr Goetzefs panels in the positionthey were intended to occupy,  so thatthe Cabinet themselves might inspectthem.?HE FOTURE (5) At the request of the Chancellor of the Exchequer,JNTFORM ANDDRESS OF THE the question of the future uniform and dress of the BritishREGULAR ARMY.Army,  submitted by the Secretary of State for War (paper cp.-1152), was postponed pending certain information as to cost,INCREASE OF (6) With reference to Cabinet 14 (20), Conclusion 2,PRE-WAR ,PENSIONS The Cabinet took note cf, and approved,the- Report of the Committee on Increaseof P***War Pensions.

APPENDIX I. TO CABINET  26(20).

COAL PRICES.

Announcement of the Cabinet decision in the form of Parliamentary question and answer as approved by the cabinet on May 10th, 1920.

Colonel Newman, - To ask the President of the Board of Trade, whether he is in a position to announce the increase in the price of coal to the industrial and private consumer rendered necessary by the recent increase in the wages and salaries of those employed in the coal industry; and can he say that, with this latest increase in price, the coal industry is now self-supporting and that no further cell will be made on the tax-payer by way of subsidy.

Mr. Bridgemen. - The suggestion in the last part of the Hon. and gallant member&apos;s question to the effect that the coal industry is at present being subsidised by the taxpayer is erroneous.

As the House is aware, coal sold for inland consumption is at present subsidised out of the profits derived from Coal which is exported. Inland Coal even before the recent advance in wages has thus been sold at less than the average cost of production - taken together with the profit allowed to the coal owners.

The greatest part of this subsidy has been granted in the form of a temporary reduction of 10/- a ton in the price of household coal. This reduction was made in order to assist the householder through the winter but industrial coal which did not obtain the advantage of this concession has also bean sold at a loss which has had to be made up from the profits on the export trade.

The Government have given very careful consideration to the question whether present conditions justify the continuance of the policy of subsidy.

They think that it is essential in the interest of the coal industry and of the country that the present control of inland distribution, should be removed as soon as possible. This can only be done if the artificial differentiation between the prices of household and industrial coal is removed.

Further there exists no reason for supplying coal to the industries of this country at less than it costs;   and the period for which the subsidy on household coal was intended to last has expired. In these circumstances the Government have come to the conclusion that household coal should no longer be sold at a less price than coal for industry and that both should be sold at a price sufficient to meet the cost of production and the standard profits allowed by the Coal Emergency Act.
To offset this result it is necessary to increase theprice of industrial coal &quot;by 4/21 per ton and the price of household coal by 14/2 per tor,      The nev. price    ill bo amaximum, not a fixed price and ; ill taice effect on Wednesday,12th May.It bo clear from hat I hove said tliat the necossityto increase the price of coal    ould have arison. apart fromthe recent advance of wages given in the Mining industry.Tho advance of wages is, hovevor, a factor in the case in sofar as it increases tie cost of production by about 2/lOd.  aton end therefore maP^o the ihoroase necessary to plao* theprice of coal on an economic basis greater by that amount.

P 0 R B T.0 A B IOI,PRE-WAR     PENSIONS     COMMITTEE.REPORT...3 OP la     The Committee was set up &quot;by decision of the Cabinet,spies.held on 11th March, 1920 cabinet 14 (20) Conclusion 2)to consider whether any steps can be taken to relieve&quot;exceptional cases of hardship among pre-war pensionersdue, for example, to age and infirmity&quot;, and presentthe following unanimous report.3 OP II.    The Committee has taken evidence from the variousTRY,Departments concerned, and has been supplied withparticulars, such as the number, grading, etc., of thedifferent classes of pre-war pensioners and the schemes-under which the pensions are paid.    Speaking generally,the scope of the enquiry has extended to pre-war pen-si oners falling Into the following main categories :-fl)    Naval and. Military peusioners;(2)    Civil Service pensioners;(3)    Police pensioners;(4)   Ex-teaohers.The total number of these pensioners is approximately140,000, of whom about 110,000 are sixty years of age and upwards, or have been retired before that age for reasons of disability.    Any concessions mads will fall to be charged upon the Exchequer except in the caseof the Onglish and Scotchpolice
police, only half of whose pensions are chargeable to imperial funds, the rest falling to be mot from localsources.III. In the course of its deliberations, the Committeeinvestigated various  schemes which ha^e been submitted toit, and has been impressed by the great difficulty ofe^ol&quot;ing a workable scheme which would at once satisfy the reasonable aspirations of the pre-war pensionerfalling within the terms of reference, and at the sametime would not Impose a wholly unjustlfi.&quot;ble biirden onthe Exchequer.    It should be noted that the. Committee isnot concerned with the grant of pensions to persons who didnet actually receive pensions before the war, e^en though in similar circumstances, such persons \would now be eligiblefor pension benefits.    On the other hand the Committeehas felt bound to take account of pensioners whose pen-sions ha^e been Increased, since the outbreak of the warthnugh to a s\ibstantially less extent than the pensionsawarded to similar pensioners under schemes now in force.IV. Under the terms of reference assistance must^be confined to exceptional cases of hardship, and It is ofthe greatest Importance that the qualifying circumstances should be defined by as broad conditions as possible soas to reduce investigation into individual circumstances.The evidence before the Committee Indicates the inpractic-abllity of basing any scheme on a distinction betweenpensions assumed to ha^e been awarded on a subsistencebasis, and those awarded simply as some recognition of  ^service.    In this connection it should be remembered thatthe -&quot;-various classes of pensioners differ greatly.    the soldier, sailor and policeman is retired while in the primeof life, and when as a rule he is able to maintain himself in remunerative ci^ll employment.   The ci^-il servant andthe teacher, on the other hand, normally&apos; retire after theirllfo&apos;s work is done at the age of sixty or thereabouts.-2-
V. After &quot;rery careful review of the material before i%the Committee ha-&quot;-e arrived at the conclusion that thequestion of hardship must in each case be determinedby reference to the following considerations(a) Service and age of pensioner;(b) Amount of pension;(c) Circumstances of pensioner(1)    Phether married or single;(ii)    Amount of means apart from pension.VI. The Committee recommends that in order to qualify for relief, a pre-war pensioner shall (1) ha^e beenpensioned on retirement for age or ha-&quot;-e completed the term of service required to earn a full service pension, or ha^e been in^alxded out of the service before completion of that term; and (2)  shall besixty years of age or o^or unless he has been invalidedout of the service.   Pridows in receipt of pensionsgranted in respect of services rendered by dec *easedhusbands may be granted the increase at the age of 40.-,VII. The Committee has felt bound, both by the termsof reference and by the need for keeping the cost ofthe scheme within moderate dimensions to fix a vigorous -maximum limit of means, and, after &quot;rerycareful consideration: recommends that the benefits ofthe scheme should be granted only to those pensionerswhose total means, inclusive of pension and of any pension bonus gi^en under this report, do not exceedIn the case of a married man  200 per annum and in the caseoi&apos; a single man  150 per annum in all.   Subject to therecommendations contained  in paragraph IX respecting theprivate means of pensioners, and subject also to thegeneral o^er-riding condition that the total moans(including pension and pension bonus under this scheme)shall not be raised in the case of a single man abo^e  150 perannum, and in the case of a married man abo-o-e  200 per annum,
the Committee recommends that relief shall be granted to pensioners satisfying the conditions laid down in paragraph^I on the following scale:-Grade (i)    Pensions of  50 a year or less to beIncreased by 50% whether the recipientis single or married0Grade (ii) Pensions of  51- 100 or if) to be increasedpensioner married of     ) by 40$ 51* 130c )Grade (ill) Pensions of  I0l- 16e,. or ) to be increased if &quot;pensioner married     ) by 30%of  lol- 200.In order to a*-oid the difficulty that a pensionerunder this scheme in receipt of a pension of, say,  51per annum would, by reason of the change of percentageget less increase than a pensioner with a pension of 50 per annum, the Committee recommends that, subject,of course, to the operation of the cmr-riding maximaof  150 and  200, the pension as increased under thescheme shall in no case be less than the maximumpension plus bonus increase payable to a pensioner inthe grade below.    Thus a pensioner in Grade (li) with apension of  51 will ha-e his pension raised to  75 the equivalent of the  50 pension plus 50^ increase of apensioner entitled to the maximum Grade (i) rate,    Apensioner whose pension Is  54 per annran, will, however, takethe 40% Increase of Grade (ii), as that Is more favourable tohim than the ttf. on the pension of  50.per annum.It is estimated that if means other than pensionare altogether disregarded, the total number of pensioners who are now in receipt of pensions of  20eper annum and under is abovit 132,000? of these 102,000 areaged 60 or o^er, or retired for disability.
I 96I Thft-aggregate cost of-&apos;the present- pensions of-tha- 102,000&apos; ..   individuals amounts te  4,280,000 and assuming that allY) would benefit- under the abovo ssale the- cost of increasing their-pensions would be about  2,000&quot;,000- por annum,. fromwhich would fall to be daduated the local&apos; contribution inrespeot of the- Police..   It must- be borhe. in. mind that- this amount will &amp;&amp;eo -be reduced by the operation-   of - the means-disqualification but it  is not possible,  in the absenteeof information as to the private means: of the pensioners to-estimate even approximately the extent of this reduction..GU1STA1TCES VIII.    The Committee considers that- in granting exceptionalfeEBTSIONERS. .relief to meet-the extra cost of living in oases of hardship,account may - properly be taken of the circumstances of thejar ri age *individual pensioner.    At the same time.,  it is cleerly im-practioable to treat each case strictly on merit,  and on thewhole it is felt that substantial justice will be attained by giving the married pensioners whose pensions exceed  ^0 perannum a somewhat higher rate of relief than similar unmarriedpensioners. . For this purpose, a widower, -unless he haschildren under 16 dependent upon him, will be treated as&quot;unmarried&quot;* .Private -   IX..        It is proposed that in all-wases falling within the.Jean s.saheme account shall be taken of private means, whether thelatter are &quot;earned&quot;&apos; or &quot;unearned&quot;. In order to ascertain the pensioner&apos;soiroumstances,  it will &quot;be necessary to obtain from every pensioner under the scheme a sworn declaration as to circumstances showing whether he is married,&apos;&apos; single or awidower-and in the latter tiase whether he has -depends &quot;t  childrenIunder 16 and also giving particulars of occupation, total means,I * &apos; &apos;etc.It is suggested that the system of -calculating means inoperation in the case of old age pensions should so far asposssible be adopted and that :in particular lump sum grants paid on retirement  in addition to pensions should be treated ascapital on the lines laid down for old age pensioners,.
PENSIONERS HIRED DURING THE WAR.

The foregoing paragraphs relate to pre-war pensioners whose pensions have not been increased during the war. Pensioners who have been granted some increase during the war should be eligible for the benefits of the scheme but it may be necessary for administrative reasons to restrict this extension to cases where the benefits of the scheme are substantially greater than those now enjoyed by the pensioners.

EX-OFFICERS AND MEN OF NAVY AND ARMY DISABLED BY PEACE-TIME INJURIES.                          

XI. The pensions of such Officers or men of the Navy and Army as have in the past been disabled by peace-time injuries and are pensioners, should be raised to the level of the post-war Warrants (but without allowances for wives or children) if this would be more favourable to them than the scale indicated in paragraph VII and that meanwhile the scale should apply to them.

MACHINERY. XII.

The Committee recommends that an Inter-Departmental Committee should be appointed to consider the best machinery for giving effect to the above recommendations. It is however suggested that the work of investigation and payment should be entrusted to the Departments responsible for paying the existing pensions and that the Treasury should have a determining voice as regards doubtful cases and should exercise general control and supervisions as to secure that the scheme is worked on uniform lines.

LEGISLATION. XIII.

The above proposals will if approved involve legislation and it is suggested that the legislation should take the form of empowering (l) the Treasury or Pension Authority by Orders in Council to grant additions to pensions payable by the State on the lines and within the maxima recommended above, an (2) Local Authorities to grant additions to pensions payable by them within the same maxima. Subject to legislative sanction being obtained it is suggested that effect should be given to the proposed concessions as from 1st April, 1920.
