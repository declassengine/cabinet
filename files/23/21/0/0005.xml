COASTAL SUBSIDY SCHEME.

(2) With reference to War Cabinet 588, Minute 4(b), the Cabinet had before them the following documents:

Memorandum by the Minister of Transport (C.P. 1000)

Memorandum by the Shipping Controller.(C.P. 1082)

The Cabinet were asked to consider:

(i) Whether the subsidy to coastal shipping should be continued, and

(ii) If continued, which Department should bear the subsidy upon its vote.

It was explained that the subsidy was set up in order to equate the coastal shipping rates with the inland railway rates and thus induce more traffic to be carried by sea. The machinery employed was a Committee set up by the Ministry of Shipping on which the Ministry of Transport was also represented and the actual payments to the traders were made through the railway authorities. The artificially low rates of the war period had been revised and since January an additional burden of £50,000,000 had been imposed with the result that the railways were now solvent and were providing the guaranteed pre-war net revenue. Strictly speaking, the subsidy granted in August ought to have been withdrawn when these higher railway rates were enacted. In any case, the money available for the payment of the subsidy, which cost about £100,000 per month, would be exhausted by about the end of April. To continue the subsidy beyond that date would involve a supplementary estimate later - a procedure to which there would be very determined opposition in Parliament, especially, in view of the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s denunciation of subsidies in general.


It was cent ended-, cd the one hand,  that coastalships were not carrying more then seme 60/; ci thepre-war traffic, while the railways were conveying from15a to ZQ;&apos;h taoro than the;-- did in their busiest pre-war year.    The railways acre,  in particular, transportinglarge guantities cf coal from the forth of England andSouth &apos;.ales to London which before the war always wentby sea.        It had been suggested that the remedy lay in raising railway rates still higher in order to forcemore traffic on to the sea route.      To this coursethere were two serious objections:-(a) The- original increase was made by meanscf a percentage addition over the whole country:to separate out and revise the competing rates,oi which there wore an enormous number, wouldbe a colossal task,(b) To force up: railway rates, which were now on an economic level, was in itself unsound andwould have the unfortunate result oi giving an artificial protection to the coastal shipperswho were uncontrolled and already enjoying highlyr e mu norafive ra t e s.against this it was argued that,  if the subsidy were removed et once,  the result might only be to increasethe congestion at the ports,  to- involve the country in heavy charges for demurrage,  and to set up a freshagitation among the manufacturers that goods were notreaching them and among the public that goods werewasting in the docks.      It was in any case difficult for the docks to deal effectively with more ships thanwere at present running owing to the great $eductionin the number of working hours The kdnistry
Ministry of cihl;.;pin  had no desiro that the subsidy should bo continued, and, as it bed not been imposedlor the bonolit of that Department,  it resisted theproposal that it should be responsible tor the Yoto.It was stated the L- ships vere yradually coming back totheir are-war routes,  that as much coal had been carried by coastal ships, last month as before the   ,&amp;r;    that,ovin:. to greatly increased wages coots, freights worenot unduly high;  and that,large profits wore being madein foreign ipather than in home trade.after further discussion tho Cabinet decided:-(l)    That inasmuch as the subsidy did not appeargreatly to have increased the coastal tonnage and in view of strong- Parliamentary objectionto a Supplementary Estimate, the subsidy tocoastal shippers should terminate In thomiddle of Lay next.(2)    That tho  $hipping Controller should call aConference of the Shipowners concerned andshould communicate to thorn tho Cabinet!decision,  indieato the grounds on which ithad been taken, and remind them, if ho thoughtwise,  of the powers oi control which theShipping ministry still possessed.(3)    That, if the Shipping Controller desired,he should bo accompanied at tho conference by the 1resident of the Board of Trade, who should, represent the parliamentary aspect&quot;of the question,(4)    Thtt tho Shipping Controller should report totho oaDinot the result of his negotiationswith the shipowners in tho event of anyinsurmountable difficulty in bringing thesubsidy to an end.(5)    That tho Shipping Controller should use everyeffort to secure the retention in the eoautaltrade of the ships now engaged in that tradeand to increase their number.
mOiPLOYMEIW (3) With reference to Cone Ins ion 6 of Cabinet 21 (20)IJtfSUR&amp;H 3dealing with the extension cf Unemployment Benefit to workers over 70 years cf age, tho Cabinet were remindedcf the following passage in a speech made by the solicitor-General in Ccmmiittee:-&quot;Be have agreed, for instance,  that unemploymentbenefit shall be grairted to men and women above70, and that will cause a Considerable furtherstrain on the original demands made by tho Billupon the fund,&quot;(Parliamentary Debates,  Standing Committee 0,March 23rd If20, p.  84)(a)    The Cabinet endorsed the policy set forth bythe Solicitor-General and decided thatcontributions should be payable by personsever 70 who come within the scheme of UnemploymentBenefit.A further question arose:    should persons    aver 70receive Unemployment Benefit in addition to an Old age pension?       It was pointed out by Sir Alfred uatson(Government actuary)  that the ground for granting anOld Age Pension was normally that a man was past workand that to recognise claims to draw cn both fundssimultaneously would mean that many eld age pensionerswould draw full Unemployment Benefit for 15 weeks a year as though,  in fact,  they were capable cf work and seekingit; and that this would involve the Panel in a charge cfabout  750,000 per annum,  i.e. , considerably more thanthe surplus new existing after allowing for tho concessionsthat have already been granted.(b)    The Cabinet decided that Old Age xensioneroshould be excluded from tho UnemploymentBenefit scheme..
TRADE (4)    The Cabinet had. ... efcre them a Memo rand-am by thoUHIOHBALIOT Minister of Labour dealing with the Trr.de Union BallotBILL.Bill which was to bo introduced or the following day by a private Member  (0... .  1112) .        Tho Bill, which ispermissive,  provides machinery en the linos of the BalletMot for properly ascortainin;  the view of workmen on industrial issues an0. is intended to remedy the abusesnow alleged to bo rife by moans of which small groups of active extremists are able to intimidate voters and secureresults which arc not truly representative of the viewsof the majority of tho constituency.It was stated that, while there was not much definite evidence of actual intimidation,  there was widespreadsuspicion in tho country that the views of the more moderate elements in the labour world wore not adequatelyreflected in tho voting; figures in connection with indus-trial disputes and threatened strikes.        It was further pointed cut that recent labour trouble had shewn thenecessity for strengthening tho powers of the State go dealwith lightning strikes and with strikes which wore notascertained to be supported by proper majorities obtainedalter an approved ballot.      Legislation on these linesmight soon become necessary which, while reserving theright to strike, -would withdraw the privileges conferred by tho Trade union .,lcts:,  in cases  of illegal strikes.Tho present Pill a: ..roachad tho problem in the mostinnocuous way and mot with the general approval of theCabinet.      Doubt was, however,  expressed as to tho extentto which,  if at all,  ouch a pormiasivd Bill,  if passed,
would bo used.The Cabinet decided:-That the minister oi Labour,  on behalf oi theGovernment, should, tentatively welcome thoprinciple of the Bill and take the line that -(a) The Bill shewed how important it was that theTrade Union leaders should endeavour to removeall grounds for the complaints to remedy which theBill had boon framed,Co)  That the most effective way in which the TradeUnions could, remove all suspicion and. the imputationof malpractices which no1.? rested upon them incorte-in cvuartors was by welcoming this Bill, whichwas permissive, and by making use of its machinery.The result should be to strengthen all that wasbest in Trade Unionism.(o) at the same time the Government wished to leavethe Bouse guite free to deal with the Bill and wouldtake the Phips off.Whitehall Gardens,april 22nd 1920
