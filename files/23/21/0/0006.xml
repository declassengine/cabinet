LONDON TRAFFIC

(6) The Cabinet had before them the following Memorandum dealing with the recommendations contained in the Report of the Advisory Committee on London Traffic (Cd.656) dated 20th March 1920.

Memorandum by the Minister of Transport (C.P.1042)                                    Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C.P. 1104)

Memorandum by the Minister of Health (C.P. 1155).

The Advisory Committee recommend the creation of a London Traffic Authority as necessary for the comfort, health, and financial interest of the public - a policy which had been recommended on four occasions by various responsible bodies during the last 15 years. In the view of the Committee, the traffic facilities of London were no longer equal to the demands put upon them: now tubes and tramways were required and a more scientific development of omnibus traffic. This programme could only be carried out at present in wasteful and uncoordinated ways even if the funds were available, but the various transport companies were, in fact, in serious financial straits. The Committee therefore recommended a permanent statutory Body under the Ministry of Transport coterminous with an area not less than that of the Metropolitan Police and with power to override Local Authorities in certain circumstances.

The Cabinet were impressed with the following considerations against taking immediate action on the lines advocated in the Report:-

(a) The effect of adopting the Report would probably be to throw upon the Exchequer the burden of new extensions and to relieve the local rates, and at the same time to bring upon the Government much criticism for defects in transport facilities.


(B) Any action taken &quot;by the Oovornuent in relation,to London Traffic would be need as a precedentfon demanding similar action and financial support in other congested areas lice tho dis-tricts around Ifchchostor ana Birmingham.(c)  It should, be possible to so cane the co-ordin-ating authority, which all agree to bo neecss-voluntary/ ary, by sor.io/* * g union on the part ofthe Local Author it, 103* concerned on linesanalogous to those followed by Main DrainageBoards on the Port of London AtithorityiIt was pointed, out,  on. tho other hand, that, whilesecuring the Central Authority, care could bo taken inthe Draft Bill to exclude the possibility of any new burdenfalling upon the taxpayers and that the cost of the regul-ating atxtbority itself cc\.ild bo made to fall on tho trans -port services themselves and not on tho Treasury.After further discuss ion the Cabinet decided:(1) That the Minister of Transport should pro-pare and. circulate to tho Cabinet, a Draft Billfor the creation of a Central Authority,0:1the uiidcrst. nlinp: that no fresh burden shouldthereby be imposed upon the Exchequer.(2) That, in reply to a question to bo asked Inthe House of Commons that day, the ministerof Transport should state that, while theGovernment were of the opinion that a CentralAuthority was needed, the project raised so many financial and administrative difflcul-tics in the relations of the Parliamentary air!tho Local Authorities co: corned that the Cab u. -1needed further time for their consideration and no go that i on.(5) That the Lord Privy Seal should convoy tollr Bonncdy Jones, H.?*,  tho Chairman of theAdvisory Committee, the thanks, of the cabinet for his servicoc and. invite his coopor-atien in the drafting of the Bill.It was understood that tho Minis tor of Transport didnotrcgard the town-planning and other powers of the propose&quot;Commvission as required in the sense suggested by the Mir &apos; -tor of Health in his Memorandum /ayd tho Minis tor of Tra:port undertook to discuss the points and endeavour to egto an arrangement with the Minister of Health.
CONTROL OF OFFICIAL MOTOR CARS.

(7) With reference to War Cabinet 635, Minute 9, the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War (C.P.274) and by the Minister of Transport (C.P.1102) dealing with the present number and control of official motor cars.

The Cabinet were informed that, exclusive of the fighting services, the number of cars used in London and under the control of the Ministry of Transport had been reduced from 41 to 27, and, while the work done had been somewhat increased, there had been an improvement of nearly 50, in running efficiency. The number of cars used by the Admiralty had been reduced to 6 with 2 in reserve. In the War Office there were 20 cars together with 7 allotted to the London District and 4 for the Eastern Command. The Air Force had 11 cars. The cars belonging to the War Office and Air Force were contrally administered from one garage and were driven by military drivers. No specific individual had a car allotted to him; all officers had to draw on the pool.

The Cabinet were agreed that there had been material improvement in the economical use of cars and that the complaints which were formerly rife had practically disappeared. The Cabinet decided:-

(l)That the administration of cars as between the Civilian and Fighting Departments should remain as at present.

(2) That every effort should be made to apply the regulations enforced in the case of Civilian cars to the cars used by the Military, Naval and Air force

The Secretary of State for War and the First Lord of the Admiralty undertook to furnish the Chancellor of the Exchequer from time to time with reports showing particulars of the running of cars under their control for his observation.
(8) The Cabinet had before then a hoficraiadrx:1 by tlxe .afufaten of Transport Pealing with the noccco-ity for1 revising the railway and tramway farescharged to workmon.    (CP. 1120).      It was pointedoat that recent changes In railway administration-ouch as tho reduction of hours and. increase of rateshad placed workmen&apos;o faros on a thoroughly illogicalbasis and. that workmen wore now being subsidised, at the enpense of the railway usci^s-The Cabinet decided:To refer the matter for consideration and report to the Rates Advisory Conm-Ittoo under Section 21 of the Ministryof Transport Act 1919, with the follow-ing terras of reference:.(a) The Minister having determined that Workmenrs fanes, which are stillon a pro-war1 basis, arc now generallyunr emune r a 11v e, tho C onmi t tee ar edesired to advise as to the host no an;of revising those fares both as regard;tho rates and. tho times during whichthese fares are in operation, havingdun regard, to tho changes which havetaken place in industrial and social conditions and. in hours of cnployiaonts in C.C workmen&apos; s faros were institutedand. to the effect of such revisionupon railway, tramway and omnibuspassenger traffic, and also uponhousing and labour generally.(b) In connection&apos;with this referencetho whole question of travellingfacilities by railway, tramway or onnbus at rates lower than ordinarypassenger f rr.o3 should be reviewed,and the Committee should, also adviseas to what modifications, if any,should be made in these lower ratesconcurrently with any revision cfw on kmc nr s f ar o s *

File No.hty^A-fii (ftoThe Prime MmnisteP had a conversation at Moontoday at 10&apos;Downing Street on the Irish Situation with    &apos;the Viceroy, the Chief Secretary and the Attorney-General.lher&amp; were also present MrBonar Law, -Mr Lono-; Tir p. KeWSir Maurice Hankey and Mr T.  Jones. up *&quot; &apos;Lord French, in response to the request . of thePrime Minister, gave an account of the present position.He said that it was now a question either of making a truce with the rebels or taking measures of wan against them.      They had declared wan against us and it was onento us to try to arrange a truce, to ask what the rebelswanted and see if we were able to satisfy them.      Themoevment had been ut - its CII.mas.-at the time of the lastGeneral Election.      Then the Sinn Feinens had swept thecountry and had thought that they would make us yield.They had established their Parliament, appointed&quot;Consuls,entered into communication with Foreign Powers,and had thought in this way to rouse the world.     But nothing had happened.     Then about August or September 1919 the out-rage &quot;and murder party told the more moderate Sinn Feiriersthat,if they could not attain better results, they (the extremists) would take the matter in hand.     ^Yie more moderate men - Idealists, as they are sometimes called -at first strongly objected; but the extremists represented that they were making war upon the English and were there/fore not guilty of murder *       Gradually they appear to Ihave brought the Sinn Feiners round to their view and    ;&quot;-the whole organisation was now imbued with the idea of     \war and justified murder on that ground.      The organisation had grown in strength and could be ousted only by force.The.rebels had the advantage of using methods of war andthese methods were denied to us.     It would be more effect-&quot;ive to put-the struggle on a war basis^as had been done Inthe Boer War when the rebels were seized and put Intoconcentration camps.     The alternative plan would be toarrange a truce, to stop murders on the one hand   anda conference in orderreached.    It wouldbe difficult to arrange such a conference.     He had made some tentative efforts In that direction at the time ofthe difficulties with the Mountjoy prisoners.     On that occasion he had been assured by the nerd Mayor of Dublin  ;that not five per cent of the Irish people wanted afiepublic and that what was really wanted was ColonialHome Rule for the whole of Ireland.     He (the Viceroy)had made it clear that the Government would ,not go backon their undertaking to Ulster any more than they wouldyiehVto recognition of a Republic     The Lord Mayor, whoarrests on the other and enter Intoto see-if some arrangement, could be reached.Yllilll- Wt-^48l-5r. 7500. 12/16.

ile No.had described himself as an advanced .Nationalist rather than as a 3inn Felner, was at the moment endeavouring to ascertain the chances of a truce and had promised to give a reply in10 or 12 days - but it was doubtful whether he sas sufficient&apos;ly influential to act as an efficient medium.     he moderateleaders, it was fairly certain,.were in favour 6f a truce;but the difficulty was to bring the advanced men to agree tothat course.     His (Lor^f French1s) impression was thatthe advanced party were a command of the others who simplydid what they were told, and that, whereas a year ago JohnMcNeill and Arthur Griffiths objected to the murders, theynov-r regarded them as incidents in the war against us.Mr Bouar Baw stated that, at a recent deputationwhich had waited upon him. Sir Edward Carson had urged thatthe situation should be dealt with on the lines adopted in previous years under similar circumstances *     Sir edward carson was at a loss to know why the Irish Government had given up keeping police in small districts: the moment thepolice were removed the district fell outside british control and anyone who objected to law breaking was leftdefenceless. In the past they had found it impossibleto control disturbances Prom the centre, and, in Sir EdwardCarsonTs view, Ireland should be divided into districts -l      and not only into military areas - and these districts shouldq    ^oLV /     be&apos;under the direction of air intelligent jaoeponoiblo Migis-r**^*&quot; &quot; trate who, while subject to the final authority of theIrish&apos; Goveriiment; should be free to move the forces aboutand to fake action.     Sir Edward Carson called attention tothe fact that the soldiers In Ireland were little more thanboys, that their officers also were young; and he suggestedthat it should be possible to second to the Irish regimentsa leavening of experienced officers who could take responsible-ility and be counted upon to act with judgment.      In hisvie Is/, the military should not themselves attempt to be the controlling forcers-but should rather be .present to supportithe police force in the discharge of their duties.    he strongly recommended making the police force larger and giving it adequate military support.      He was doubtful aboutthe wood effects of deportations and thought that a largenumber of arrests only played Into the hands of the rebels.He held that arrests should be as few as possible, unlessthe orisoners could be tried, and that the number.of raidsshould be restricted.      It was important to give protection7,368). Wt.46,489-51. 7500. 12/16. Gp.133. A.&amp;E.W.7,988).   ,, 60,053-62. 20,000. 1/17.     ,,[P.T. Over.
Blto threatened persons, as, without this, all faith in theBritish power would Be gone.Lord French said that raids &quot;were useful not so much for obtaining arras as information.      There was a districtorganisation with, military support in force at present andthere were private houses in which troops were lodged.    Butit was not possible to use soldiers as policemen and therewere not enough troops to distribute over and supportall places1. To do -of effectives now inso would require threeIreland - i.e. 19,500.tPnes the numberThe Chiel Secretary said that three forms of cbn-spiracy could be distinguished in Ireland - agrarian, Labourand murder.

It possibly had been a mistake to move the policefrom the barracks but there Y/as no alternative.      The barrackswere small buildings with no accomfcdation for troops.      As tothe general situation it was difficult to suggest a remedy.At the last Winter Assizes there had been a good many convictionsobtained but in the murder cases git has difficult to getevidence.     -  The venue of the trl^s had been repeatedlychanged.      The really bad areas were Cork, Galway,  Clare andLublin and a portion of Co.Tipperary.      More soldiers were needed in these counties and they should be more mobile.In reply to a question he said that Courts Martial couldbe used for offences under L.O.E.A. though they (the courts martial) could not try capital charges or give sentences of death.    . They could go up to 15 years penal servitude and theyhad given sharp sentences for carrying arms and explosives.He thought that gradually the South Irish would fall into twocamps.In reply to a suggestion that more aeroplanes should, beavailable it was stated that Gen.Macdonogh was looking intothis and similar matters.The Prime -Minister said that the disorder must be putdoY/n at. whatever cost. .    If there were a truce it would be an admission that we were beaten and it might&apos; lead to our having to give up Ireland.      It was very probable that the number oftroops was inadequate but whatever was necessary the IrishGovernment should get. &apos;     The first thing was for the chief secretary to&quot;go over to Ireland and remain there for threeweeks in order to&apos; obtain a preliminary view and to reach someprovisional conclusions.      He could take it that the cabinet would siipport any demand to maintain order.      Home Rule wouldbe an utter failure unless and until order were restored.On the one hand they had to restore order and ensure the sympathy of moderate people and on the other they ought inParliament to be proceeding simultaneously with the provisionof remedial measures.Lord French:    Woiild you go so far as to declare war?Mr Bonar Lav/: That would be a confession of failure.The&apos; Prime Minister: You do not declare war against rebels.The Chief Secret ar y^c a 11efl attention to an amendmentwhich had been made as phi^iredf)       ffe to^o .Orders for deportationgTbTe&quot;signed by the Lord Lieutenant,as political head he was responsible to the Bouse of Commons.Lord French\stated that the change had been made owfng tothe absence of the late Chief Secretary in the South of Prance.Mr Bonar Law asked would it not be pos sible to set up an advisory Committee as was done after the Rebellion to examinethe evidence on which ^fcg men were committed to prison withouttrial.        e.g. a judge and two Members of Parliament.Lord French stated that men were only deported afterthe evidence had been before the Attorney General and himself.The Attorney General pointed out that it was open to thesemen to lodge an appeal within 7 days but they did not do this because they defied the law.Ivlr Bonar&apos;Lhw saici that the initiative could be takenby the Irish Government.The Chief Secretary replied that that would weaken theIrish Executive and would in fact be an English Oourt$ -supervising the actions of the Irish Executive.    He agreedthat at this stage, it was not possible to declare war.The Prime Minister said that he did not wish &amp;ny decision taken until the Lord Lieutenant and the Chief Secretary had had time to examine the situation.
