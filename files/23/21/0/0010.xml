,1 of theirt of the Array in India Committee, together with a telegram from thein IndiaLttec,l9l9- Covernment of India dated April 1,  1920 (Paper  C.I.D.-115 d, and C.P.-1109).*financial n f or)erial It wag explained that the Army in India Committee,J.-iii.  Stuff.some of whose members had been to India for the purpose of:itu.t ion-n\n.ona    taking evidence and had returned, was now in a position tofake up the three remaining parts of its work;    but LordEsher (the Chairman) was anxious, in order to facilitate the Committee&apos;s labours, to obtain a decision in regard to part I, which had been presented before the departure of a portion of the Committee to India.!The attention of the Cabinet was first drawn to the trend of opinion in certain responsible quarters, whichwas referred to in the Committee&apos;s oovering Report, towardsthe creation of an Imperial General Staff,   The Cabinet were informed that one of the most Important suggestions inthis respect had been for the appointment of a Chief of theImperial General Staff who should bear a position towardsthe several autonomous parts of the British Empire somewhatanalogous to that occupied at the end of the War by MarshalPoch towards the Allied Governments, and who would be in aposition to prescribe the contribution to be made by eachpart of the Empire towards a common Imperial Defence Force.It was generally agreed that this was a questionwhich would require the closest consultation with theDominions,  and that, whatever might be the position in thee^ent of further developments of the- constitutional rela-tions between the mother-country and the Dominions and indian the present state of those relations the discussion ofmilitary proposals of this kind was premature.    Therelations between the Army In India and the Imperial forces must be based on existing constitutional conditions.ggMY MIf ^)-The Cabinet ha^LJ^efNn-e-ifn^of State for India, covering Part I of the Report of the
Considerable stress was laid on the effect which, theproposals of the Cocimit t-e-e&quot;would..have on the quasi inde-pendent position which had been held in the past by theGovernment of India, which had been able, spontaneously andas an act of favour,  to offer valuable assistance to theImperial Government on many occasions, for example,in theSouth African &apos;7ar, and. even more so in the Boxer campaign.Emphasis was laid on the valuable effect of this on Anglo-Indian relations, and more particularly on Indian public-opinion, which had realised with a thrill of pride and half-conscious dignity the power that India possessed to assistthe Ir^pe^ial Government by means of an Arcry raised, main-tained and directed by the Government of India.It was pointed out that the Report was slightly con-tradictory in regard to the appointment of the commands-in-Ohief in India.    In one part of the Committee1s Report it wassuggested that he should be appointed with the concurrence ofthe Chief of the Imperial General Staff, and, in another,  onthe re commer.dat ion of the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff;    while the Secretary of State for India, in hiscovering Note, advised th t the appointment should be made bythe Secretary of State for yar, acting in consultation withthe Secretary of State for India. -The latter view, which was understood to correspond with existing practice,  commended itself to the Cabinet,on the understanding that the Prime Minister of the day would ah-ays be consulted.Doubts  were expressed as to the expediency,  except under careful restrictions, of direct communications betweenthe Commandor-in-Chifef in India and the Chief of theImperial General Staff at home,  since expedience showed that a correspondence begun as a purely military matter*ss apt unavoidably to become linked up with matters offoreign noli ay. -3-
Tt. wa^..exrplahjie-dvy how-e-ver-,  Chart,*ttrLs&quot; -di^flAralty wcuiibe met by the proposal of th.e Secretary of State for india that such communications should only be allowed in the condi-tions by which they were restricted when permitted as a tem-porary arrangement during the 7/ar.The comments of the Committee on the office of secretary to the Government of India in the Army department as inconvenient and undesirable were called into question astending to place the Viceroy, who had in the past been in the habit of seeing the Secretary to the Government in the army department every week,  less in touch with military matters.This question, however, was not pressed, as it was understoodthat it would be dealt with in further detail in the laterReports of the Committee.There was also some discussion as to the proposal nolonger to retain in the India Council a military officer of high rank.    This proposal was generally accepted, subject to suitable arrangements in regard to the position of theSecretary in the Military Department of the India Office,It was generally agreed that the Secretary of State foi*India should only have one Military Adviser, who should bein a position to express the views of the Chief of theImperial General Staff on strategical questions.The general view of the Cabinet was that some furtherdeliberation was necessary, and that it would be advisable for the Government not to commit itself to a.final decision until the whole of the Committee&apos;s Report was before them,Tt was recognised, however,  that the Report containedrecommendations of great value which might with advantage beintroduced without delay.It was agreed  (a)  That the Secretary of State for India andthe Secretary of State for War should confer-4-
and. make a Joint report to the Cabinet J. U  as to those of the Committee &apos; s recera-mend at ions which might with advantage be adopted at oncer&quot;(b) That the Secretary of State for india should be authorised to in:orra theChairman of the Committee that theCabinet were favourably disposed towardsthe Report, subject to such changes as were required to bring it Into line with existing&apos; constitutional relations, butthat they could give no final decisionon Part I of the Report as a whole untilthe remaining portions of the Committees sReport were before them.(3) with reference to Cabinet 24 (20), Conclusion 1, theSecretary of State lor War asked the Cabinet and the Seere-tary of State  -or Foreign Affairs to take note that thesituation in regard to Batum was rapidly degenerating.    TheFrench Government, who had been pressed by the Britishplenipotentiaries at San Remo to send a white Battalion,were now proposing to send a coloured Battalion.    The Seore-tary oi State for Foreign Affairs was, it was true,urgingthem to redeem their promise to send a white Battalion, butit was doubtful if one was available.    The Turkish National-ists had already reached Panderma, on the Sea of Marmora,and were marching towards Chanak, which meant the possibilityoi hostilities in this region.    In these circumstances theChiei of the Imperial General Staff had prohibited thedetachment of an additional British white Battalion to Batum,although the situation-was so bad there that it was urgently required.    The trade of Batum with the interior was coming toa step, and the town was filling up with refugees;    the ques-tion of feeding the population would therefore arise very shortly.    There was reason to apprehend that the Armeniansmight shortly tr*at with the Bolsheviks.    In these circum-stances he wished once more formally to request that theBritish forces should be withdrawn from Batum.The Seci.?tar., of State ior Foreign Affairs pointedout that General hilne had been given authority to withdraw
the iorces in the event of imminent danger.    Neither theGeorgians nor the Armenians had yet responded to the overturesoi the Bolsheviks, but it would be very difficult to conductour foreign policy in these regions if all simulacrum ofAllied interest there was withdrawn.    He hoped,therefore,that the Cabinet would not reverse their decision of May 6th,and that the Secretary of State for War would be satisfied with the authority given to General Milne to withdraw incase 01 erne*ge contingency.The Secretary of State for V,ar stated that,for themoment, he would content himself with asking the Cabinet totake note of his statement.(4) With reference to Cabinet 13 (20), Appendix, (7),the Cabinet had belore them a Memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer on the subject of Russian Refugees (paper cp.-1206).It was suggested that if the Foreign Office considered it necessary for the British Government to take responsibility in regard to these refugees, they should provide an effeotiveorganisation for dealing with them.It was agreed  That a Committee, composed of rspresenta-tives of  The Treasury (Sir George Barstow),The War Office,The Foreign Office,should meet to ascertain the facts andrepoit to the Cabinet.
J2slrLnet-^aad before then the fcKU^wixMsp^^ on thesubject of asphyxiating gases:-A Draft hen.orand.ura for presentation tothe Council of the learue of Nations,prepared by the Secretary in order togive effect to the decision of theCabinet on March 4th (Paper CP.-1218):A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor far,  covering a Minute by the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff,   containing the following recommendations(i) That gas should be  definitely ac-cepted as a weapon of war:(ii) That the Government&apos;s policy shouldbe to educate public, opinion infavour of the use of gas as a weapon,instead of against it:(iii) That no limit  (other than financial)should be placed on our activities in studying and developing gas as a weapon:(iv) That,  once at war,, the War office should be empowered to use gas when and where they consider that the mil-itary situation demands it.(Paper CP.-12-11).A Note by the First Lord of the Admiraltycovering a Memorandum by the First sea lord and Chief of the Naval Staff,  stronglysupporting the recommendations of the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff (Paper C.P.-12-46).The Cabinet decision on March 4th   had been that thewhole question should be raised at the Council of the League,of Nations, but that,before a final decision was taken, theBritish Representative should refer to the Cabinet forfurther instructions.    In the meantime,  researches should becontinued on the narrowest possible scale and in the mostunobtrusive manner.The new factors and arguments brought before theCabinet may be summarised as follows:-   The United StatesGovernment, which had been foremost in urging the League ofNations and humanitarian principles generally on the Powersassociated with it in the late War, have voted no less than 26,000,000, and spent&apos;half that sum for gas waxvfa-e in one
y*ar; - the^have-^^ for naval warfare.     OtherGovernments are continuing they^-eanerurients.   While theBritish Fighting Services are hampered by the uncertain atti-tude of the Government as to the employment of gas, theycannot keep together the necessary scientific staff for con-ducting the experiments and researches required to keep themabreast of other nations in gas warfare, whether for offensiveor defensive purposes.    In fact,  our gas organisation is threatened with extinction.    Consequently, there is a grave danger that we may fall behind and be taken at a disadvantage in the event of war.    The conditions required for the produc-tion of gas are of such a nature that,, even if an internation-al agreement was readied; measures could not be devised tosafeguard against clandestine preparations.   A Power whichloyally adhered to its engagements, as we should, would beoverwhelmingly at a disadvantage compared with a. Power thatdid not do so.On the other hand,, it was urged that, vrtiatever thedecision of the Council of the League, we should gain byclearing up this question..   If the Council supported thedenunciation of this form of warfare by the Allies in March,;1918,. our present attitude would be justified.      In thecontrary event we should know where we were.The Cabinet generally agreed that,, before entering into any international agreement, it would be essentialto establish that effective means had been taken to ensurethat no nation, whether a member of the League of Nations ornot, could --make clandestine preparations to evade it.It was pointed out that before long some limitationmust be placed on the use of poison in warfare.    Otherwise,,there would be no limit to the destructiveness not merely toarmies but also to civil populations from the employment ofbacteriological and other poisonous methods.   It was suggestedthat the limitation of the use of poison was only part ofthe general codification of the law and practice of war,
K-ENEMY (6) The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the3BIPS.Shipping Controller, submittinr for their approval an agree-ment made with M. Paul Bignon,the French Minister 01 Shipping,in regard to the ultimate disposal of enemy tonnage (paper c.r&apos;.-124l).The Cabinet approved the agreement.(NOTE BY THE SECRETARY.  Since drafting this Minute, a messagehas been received from the Shipping Controller asking thatthe decision may be reserved for the present, as he has just received fresh inioimation on the subject which renders it undesirable to settle this question.    In the absence of an?/further communication it may he assumed that this decision is in abeyance.)(7) With reference to Cabinet 26 (20),Conclusion 5, theCabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor War on the subject of the future uniform and dress of thei.Re gu1ar Army (Pape r&apos;C. P.-1152).whioh would ...haw to &quot;he nmderi^aken- wheaa juhOv J^e-ague-oof &quot;Nations- -was firmly established.In view of the fact that the subject is not on theAgenda for the Rome meeting of the Council of the League ofNations, and in any event would certainly be remitted in thefirst instance to the Military Commission of the League ofNations, which has not yet been constituted) the cabinet agreed -(a) That the-question should be reviewed bythe Cabinet after the return of Mr fialfour:(b) That the Secretary should draft, for theapproval of the Lord Privy Seal, a com-munication to Mr Balfour, giving him the salient features of the discussion and asking him to make infonaal enquiries asto the probable attitude of the Councilof the League of Nations towards thisquestion:(c) That if it should be decided to presentthe Memorandum to the Council of the Leagueof Nations ,it should be re-drafted and aninterrogative form should be substitutedfor the &quot;direct recommendations coxitainedin the pissent dxaft, which is based onearlier Cabinet decisions:(d) That in the meantime the Fighting services should continue their exoeiiments andresearches.

The Conference had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Health calling attention to the seriousstate of the financial position of tho Government1s housing programme. (CP. 1183 ).The Conference were informed that whereas tenders for100,000 houses had been received by tho Local xluthoritics,svfbmitted to the Ministry of Health, and finally approvedby them- work on those houses in a large number of caseswas suspended,or had not begun,for lack of money.     This was particularly the caso in the Metropolitan Area and in the immediately s^^rr^ounding counties *       Tho London CountyCouncil had proposed to issuo  7,000,000 in stock at 6p; but onthe first day of the issue Treasury Bills were put up to** with the immediate result, It was alleged, that 90^of tho whole London County Council issue was lefpt with theunderwriters.     The further effect was to hold up the issueof stock by the County Councils of Middlesen, Esson, and Kentand. to delay actual building operations for six or sevenweeks. It was also suggested that the now Government Bonds,the issue of Which had been announced by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer this woek^with a guaranteed minimum rate of 5%per annum, \7ould have a prejudicial effect on the Housing Bondlscampaign.-It was argued from tho Treasury standpoint that the new government Bonds would probably appeal to a quite different clasof investor and that it was doubtful whether that class wouildnot prefer a certain 1% to a guaranteed Q% with a fluctuatingrate above that figure.     There was the further considerationto be borne in mind that,if the present effort to deal with theEloating Debt mot .with substantial success, it would, havean important effect In checking further rises in prices and inthe rate of interest.
bill the attention of the Conference was called to theclifficulites connected with certain Local Authorities whoserateable value was over  200;000 and who could not for that reason borrow from the fhxblLe Works Loans CommisslonersoIt was generally agreed that special measures were requiredto moot the needs of such cases.It was also agreed that some machinery was necessaryto prevent undue competition and overlapping between theGovernment and Municipal Loans and between one Local authority and another in their- effort to raise money, and that for thispurpose a small commix.dee of Cityadvisors  to the Chancellor of theHoaltlia     This suggestion met with the general approval ofthe C o nf en e nc e ^The Conference docidod;-That the following Committee -Sir L- Worthington Evans,En Add.is on,Mr Stanley Baldwin,Mr Blackett,Mr- ReBtHowssth, Secretory,should, meet that afternoon to consider:(1)(2)(3)(4)The Representatives of the Treasury explained thatthey had not been able to consult the Chancellorof the Exchequer on the questions raised at the meet-ing, but they would at. once lay them before mr chamberlain for his consider a cion*experts might be useful asExchequer and the Minister ofThe appointment cf a small Committee of Citypxperto to advise the Chancellor of the Exeaeq-uer and the Minister of Health on the raising of money for the government&apos;s Housing programmeTho special cases of towns witha rateable value over  .200,000 which were finding itdifficult to raise money for housing*The question of departing from tho 6% ratecf Interest in special circumstances, and generally,The bo.sis for the statement tc be made bythe Prime Minister at the Guildhall meetingon Monday nexto2 Whitehall Gardens, SdhApril 30th, 1920

P -;Iilk&apos; ION OFf pNMENT&apos;liOTRESRELATIONSTRIKES.(1) With referenoe to Home Affairs Committee 50, Minute 7,the Conference had before them the following documents:-A Memorandum by the First Lo-d of theAdmiralty (Paeer CP,-644),A Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (Paper CP,-688),A Memorandum by the Postmaster-Gene-al.(Paper C.P.-719),A Memorandum) by the Chancellor of theExchequer-  (Paper CP.-1162).The position of established dockyard workmen had previously been before the Pome Affairs Committee in rela-tion +-0 two established men who had struck work, and, inconsequence of certain negotiations which were proceeding with the Trade Unions In respect of men who had refused to strike, the Home Affairs Committee had agreed to the action taken by the Admiralty in reinstating those men, withoutprejudice, and on the understanding that their cases were still sub rludice.    It, was explained that informal negotif:-&quot;-tions were still proceeding -&apos;ith the Trade Unions, and itwas believed that the Trade Unions would agree to rescind,the expulsion of the men who had refused to strike, but would insist on imposing a penalty on them in order to upholdTrade Union principles.In the. Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(Pape.&quot; CP.-1162) it was pointed out that the whole question had been re-opened by the participation of Irish PostalWorkers in the recent general strike in Ireland,  and thatthe matter would shortly be brought to a head by the decisionof a forthcoming conference of the Union of Postal Workers,to be held in a few days&apos; time, at which the ExecutiveCouncil would propose the institution of a strike policy.It was therefore suggested that Ministers must be prepared with a definite policy,  and, that the &quot;one Affairs Committeeshould be asked to re-conside- tio whole matter and make recommendations to the Cabinet..-1-
It waa. stated that&apos;the&apos; Home Affairs Committee&quot; hadbeen lately influenced, in their decision to allow the caseof the Admiralty worker to stand over by the desire notto complicate the negotiations the Admiralty had already undertaken for the reinstatement in Trade Unions of estab-lished workmen who. had refused to strike, and a decisionon the question of general principle was desirable.Continuity of service was an essential element inthe pension system,  in return for which Civil Servantsobtained security of tenure for their working livds.    Ifthey were to. be allowed to strike with impunity,  the tax-payer would get nothing in return for the heavy burden ofthe pension system.It was pointed out,  on the other hand,  that theposition of established Civil Servants was closely analogous&quot;to that of workmen qualifying for pensions in the railway services, who had frequently struck.    It had been impossibleto penalise these men.    In the same way, the Governmentwould be unable to prevent a Civil Service strike where alarge mass of men were involved, as in the Postal .or Tele-graph Service,  or where a widespread strike was threatenedon.account of action taken in respect of one individual.The opinion was expressed that the only way to dealwith the matter was by legislation forbidding a strike by civil Servants without adequate notice, as in the case of workmen erroloyed in gas and water undertakings.The Conference were ^general   ^Jly.n^gr-e^d-that..CivilServants should not be permitted to go on. strike &quot;withimpnnity, but also reoognlsexr-IJae^in enforcing any penalty in the% ease or^strlke^shar^----.large numbers were involved.The Conference agreed  (a) That the Home Affairs Committee, in con--sultation with Ministers in charge of departments by which large numbers of established workmen were employed, be requested forthwith to consider the-matter in all Its bearings,  and make recommendations to the Cabinet:
itRGBS.(b) That the Home Affairs Committee be re-quested to consider whether a decision should be taken on the position of thetwo established Admiralty workmen whohad taken part in the ironfounders&apos;strike,  on the understanding that inno circumstances would the. government agree to a penalty being imposed by trade Unions on the established menwho had refused to strike.I AND PIER       (2) The Conference had under consideration a Memorandumby the Minister of Transport (Pane&quot; CP.-1177.) covering adraft Pill to make provision for the temporary modificationof the charges which may bo made in respect of ports, harbour,dock and pier undertakings.    It was proposed,  in view of theincreased wages payable to dockers in consequence of theaward given by Lord Shaw&apos;s Committee, under the industrial courts Act, to empower the Ministry of Transport to raisethe statutory maximum charges  of these undertakings,  affeertaking the advice of the Rates Advisory Committee upon theproposed increase.    It was also proposed to give the Ministi-of Transport power to issue Interim Orders, valid for notmore than six months, to be made pending the receipt of thereport from the Rates Advisory Committee.The Conference agreed  (a) To approve in y zinciple the proposals contained in the Bill:(b) That the details of the Bill should be referred,to a meeting of the Home Affairs Committee tobe held the same afternoon;(c) That,  subject to (b),  the Bill should beintroduced by the Minister of Transport.f ABILITY&quot;SIGNS .(3) With reference to Cabinet 5 (20),  Conclusion 3,Cabinet 14 (20),  Conclusion 2, and Finance Comrait+ee 18,Conclusion 1, the Conference had under consideration the interim and Main Reports on Disability Pensions submittedby the Disability Pensions Committee (Papers CP.-847 and cp.-1154) .It appeared that, with the exception of one or two points of detail, the Committee&apos;s recommendations were unanimous,  and the Conference decided
