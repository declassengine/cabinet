U)^5-tbrr^ 10 (19), Appendix IV, theCabinet. had., before them a- lfemo*andum^ -the.Board of Trade on the subjeot of Coal Prices (Paper C.P.-1158), which,contained the following recommendations:-(X^ The price of inland-coal, which is at presai tbeing sold at a loss, should be raised to aneconomic- level, as follows i-(a) The price of industrial coal to beincreased by 4s.2d. per ton:l(b) The price of household coal to beincreased by 14s.2d, a ton.The proposed new price should be a maximum price only, and there should be no minimum,(ii) That this should be accompanied by a relax-ation of Government control over the dis-tributifrn of coal for home consumption, andcontrol should hereafter be confined -(a) To the regulation of exports in sucha way as to ensure that sufficient supplies will beheld in the countryfor home needs:(b) To the regulation of home prices insuch a way as to prevent prices risingunduly.In amplification of the reasons given in the Memo-randum in favour of these proposals, it was pointed out thatthe present cohditions of the coal industry were abnormaland indefensible.   Coal for home consumption, both for industrial and domestic purposes, was sold far below its economic value.    The coal industry was, therefore, in adifferent position from all other industries.    Cotton, wool,and other commodities, %vere sold at world prices, whereasonly about one-sixth of the coal output was sold at world prices, and this was strictly controlled.    This was not onlyobjected to by both the mine-owners and the miners, butcaused a variety of complications and difficulties.    Forexample, the public often did not obtain the quality ofcoal they desired, and there was much consequent waste.The management of the mines did not deal direct with itscustomers, and had no interest to supply the quality of coalthey required.    They also had little incentive to manage
their- mines irrifhe&quot;miiosl^ &apos;produoe&apos;-t&apos;helargest quantity of obal.Certain oritioisms were then raised, among which themore important are the following:-(i) The difficulty which would arise as regardsthe disposal of the profit on export coal,estimated at  60,000.000 a year.-It was urged that the appropriation of this sum by theExchequer could easily be defended, on the ground, that, butfor the limitation in the price of coal, the Exchequer would obtain a much larger sum than  60*000,000 from the ExcessProfits Tax.(ii) When the fact that the Exchequer wag aepro-priating the  60,000,000 profit on export coal became known,  the miners would put ina claim for their 3hare of it.This was admitted,  but it was felt that- the whole questionof the disposal of this profit could stand over for thep resent,(iii) Foreign C-governments would protest againstthe difference between the export price andthe home price.-It was felt, however, that these protests would be lesseffectual after the home prices had been raised.(iv) The bad effect en public opinion of a risein coal prices at a time when the prices ofbrvip-d and sugar were also being raised,  andthe possibility of starting a fresh cycle of wage increases.In regard to this it was pointed out that, according to theestimates of the Board of Trade, the proposed increase Inthe price of coal would only account for a rise of two points in the Labour Gazette scales of increases in thecost of living.   This was only a very small increase comparedwith the increase due to the enhanced price of sugar andbread, the latter of which would alone account for a rise of four or five points.   At the present time the increased costof living above the pre-war level was estimated at 132 percent.   The increased price of bread would alons bring thelevel above 135 per cent., involving an additional 1/-
v^ -week, in w-ag-ee,. . S\tga^r--wwild^^^ ein&apos;rreiv^v^^ account for a two-points rise.Further,  it was urged that the reduction of 10/- in the&apos;p.riae-.of coal, made last November, was a temporary expedient to lighten the cost of living during the difficult winterperiod.    The -pre&amp;cnt- -une-oonomieal level of coal prices could not be indefinitely maintained, and the best moment for making the change was at the beginning of sximmer.    On theother ..hand,  it was suggested that the psychological effectyf a rise in the price of coal would be of greater importance than the-factual, increase it caused in the crvst of living,and that the middle--cla-sa would be particularly hard hit bythe withdrawal of the one concession (the ..reductio-n .of 10/in the price of coal) which had been given to it.(v)  The Government would be accused of contin-ually chopping and changing in regard to coal prices .It was pointed out,  on the other hand,  that the change now contemplated would bring prices to an economic level, andthat the public was prepared for a rise in the price of coal.(vi)  The regulation of exports to ensure that sufficient supplies were available for home needs might result in throwing onto the transport services of the country a heavier burden than they could cope with,particularly as it was.stated that therewas an increased demand, for industrial coal.The transport services of the country were,it was mentioned, already *ver-taxed withcarrying coal for which the railways hadnot been laid out.It^was pointed out, however, that the oontrol on export was already in operation,  and no new power was being sought inthis.. respect,    It was recognised that- the restriction onthe--export of coal should be carried out in consultationwith the Ministry of Transport.The Minister of Transport asked that,, before anannouncement was made,  opportunity might be given to his department further to examine the feasibility of theproposals,  from a transport point of view,
1; While r-eacMrnxstng -the gravity of these objections,the Cabinet felt that they -were- Wpreighed by the advantages of getting rid of the present abnormal and&apos;&quot;Inde-fwmibae nyytrtroof coal control.    It was therefore agreed -(a) That the price of industrial coal should beincreased by 4s,.Sd.  a .ton, and the price of household coal by 14s. fed. a :ton, the new,price to be a&apos; maximum, with no minimum price:(b) That the above increase in prices should befollowed by a relaxation of Government con-trol over the distribution of cosal for home consumption, and cont-ol should thereafter be confined  (.1) To the regulation of exports in sucha way .as to ensure that sufficient supplies will be held in. the countryfor home needs:    this regulation of exports to be oa-ried out by close consultation between the Coal Con-troller and the Ministry of Trans-port * in order to avoid throwing an excessive strain on the transport services of the country:(ii) To the regulation of home prices insuch a way as to prevent prices risingunduly.(c) That,  subject to the agreement of the Ministerof Transport, who desired further consultation between his Department and the Coal Controlleras to the effect  of these proposals on trans-port,  the President of the Board of trade should be authorised to announce this decision in the tfouse of Commons on Monday, May 10th,as tahing effect, as to prices immediately,and as to de-control of distribution on june 1st:(d) To leave for further consideration the ques-tion of the disposal of profits on export coal:    the President of the Board of Tradeto use his  discretion as to when this ques-tion should be brought before the Cabinet.PRICE OP (3)  In connection with the foregoing discussion,  theBBNKER COAL.-. Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Shipping Con-troller with regard to the price of bunker coal (Paper CP.-1180).It was agreed  -That this question should be discussedearly in the following week.
;INGREASii INTHE COST OPLabouwGazetteScales.EXPORT OPCOAL.ProposedCoraiaittee .(3) During&apos;the-&apos; discrue-aiom--on^Goal^.Prace^--allTiffion---wasmade to the inaccuracy of some of the data on which theLabour Gazette scales of increase in the cost of livingwere calculated.    It was pointed out, for example, thatthe assumption was made that the consumption of sugar wasthe same as before the War, whereas,  owing to rationing, itis in fact about half,  so that the actual increase in thecost of living due to sugar is much below the scale figure.Similarly, it was assumed,  on a p^e-wa&quot; basis, that theconsumption of butter was seven times greater than that of margarine.    Other Instances were adduced.The suggestion was made that the whole subject oughtto be reviewed.    In this connection it was stated that theLabour leaders believed that an alteration in the scalewould &quot;result in geat advantages to the warre-earner.( No , Conclusion was reached,.)(4) The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs,  suggesting theformation of a Committee composed of representatives of theBoard of Trade,  the Coal Controller&apos; s Department,  theMinistry of Shipping and the Foreign Office, to report whether, without altering our general policy, some scheme could be devised whereby those countries suffering fromacute coal shortage would be assured of supplies propor-tionate to their minimum requirements,  and proportionate tothe amount of coal available at any given time (Paper O.P.-954) .The Cabinet were Informed that conversations on thissubject were about to take place between representativesof the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade *Subject to the proposed Committee beingapproved in these conversations by theForeign Office and the Board of Trade,the  Cabinet sanctioned its formation.The exact scope of its functions was left for arrangement between theDepartments concerned.
IrJPANG?J0aId      (5) l?ith &quot;efe^ence to  cabinet 10 (19), Appendix IV (g),the Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary, coveringcorrespondence between the Secretary to the Cabinet and thePresident of the Board of Trade on the subject of the exportof coal and coke to Prance and Italy (Paper CP.-1223).    this correspondence arose out of various communications receivedby the Prime Minister from the Presidents of the councils of Prance and Italy respectively.The Cabinet, while sharing the Prime Minister&apos;desire to deal wif- the requests of Prance and Italy inthe most sympathetic spirit,  supported the general attitude taken up by the President of the Board of Trade in this correspondence.    It was felt that the French and italian governments did not sufficiently realise that British coalcould be sold elsewhere under more favourable conditionswithout any difficulty, and that the preference they askedfor was equivalent to a subsidy from the British Exchequer.. CONGESTIONCP DOCKS.&quot;vat-ImportediMeat,(6) With reference to Cabinet SO (30), Appendix II (4)(a), the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by Sir laming worthington Evans on the congestion of the docks in respectof imported meat and the disposal of surplus bacon andmut t on ( Pape r C. Ih -1C26)..Sir Laming Worthington Evans gave some furtherexplanations in regard to his Memorandum;  an the course ofwhich he pointed out that, although he had not yet beenable to obtain precise statistics, the following facts werenot disputed:-(i)  Including the existing stocks of imported meat at  home , quantities on the water andin cold storage in Australia and I0ev? Zealand,there was a&apos; surplus of i\% least sco-, 000 tons,which might be much greater-.(ii)  Demurrage was costing  3,000 a day, and.had already cost  1,000,000,(iii) The^3 was due to arrive in this country before june 30th. at least 70,000 tons over and above what could he accommodated in cold storage.There were only two practicable methods of effecting a reduction! namely, to increasehome consumption and to dispose of part ofthe surplus abroad.
SUPPLY OFLABOUR FORIuIIDTHG.This view was generally accepted, and the opinion was expressed that,  in view of the actual cost involved in demur-rage and other charges, it would be worth while to take rj. .v.-in granting credit to any foreign purchasers who could befound.The Cabinet agreed   &quot;(a) That, in order to increase home consumption,the Food Controller should be authorised toreduce the price of imported mutton and lambto the extent of 3d. per lb., and to selldamaged meat at even a lower price, though he should have discretion to vary the wriceof the differe&amp;t  joints, etc., and that heshould publicly announce the reduction as for three months:(b) In order to combat the Idea that the pricehad been lowered because the meat is staleand bad, the Ministry of Food should beauthorised to spend a. sufficient sum inadvertising the facts of the situation,the cause of tve  congestion which is aresult of the submarine wa-fere, and thereasons for the reduction in price:(c) The Ministry of Food should take steps toensure that the public get the benefit ofthe reduction in price:(d) Sith a view to increased sales abroad,  theMinistry of Food should be given a free hand to sell,on the best terms they can obtain,to.Austria or Germany, or elsewhere abroad,up to 100,000 tons of mutton:(e) The Ministry of Food should make a furtherreoort to the Cabinet in two months&apos; time,that is to say, the first week of July.(f) All arrangements, in connection with importedmeat6  including sales and contracts, and in-eluding all ancillary services, should betransferred from, the Boa-d of Trade to theMinistry of Food.(7) w-ith ^ePerence to Cabinet 9 (19),  Conclusion 6 (i) and(3), the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the first commissioner of Works on the Supply of Labour for Building(Paper 0.1.-1225).    In this Memorandum it was proposed thata Minister, who was not himself directly interested either in the building schemes of Government Departments or in theexecution of the Government Housing Scheme,  should be ap-pointed to adjudicate uoon which of the Departmental schemes,provided for in the Estimates of the Office of &quot;rorks, shouldbe allowed to proceed. -7-
The Cabinet agreed -That a Cabinet Coraaitt.ee, composed asfollows&quot;.-Sir Laming Worthington Evans (in the Chair)The Minister of Labour,The Minister of Tensions,The Pos tmaster-General,The Minister of Health,The First Commissioner of Works,should meet at once to review the building programme included in the Estimates of theOffice of Works on behalf of .various Gov-errcaent Departments, and to decide in alldoubtful cases whether building should be permitted to proceed or not.$PTES OF FREIGHT (8)TO Bp PAID W TKRMINISTRY OF SHIP-PI KG BY THE INDIAOFFICE.The Cahinet took note of th.* settlementof the question of rates of freight tobe paid to the Ministry of Shipping by-the India Office, contained in the Memo-randum by Sir Laming Worthing on Evansdated April S3, 1920 (Paper C.P.-1148).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,May S, 19B0.
