(1) The Cabinet had before them copies of correspondencein regard to a proposed Military Agreement between GreatBritain, Prance and Belgium, to provide against any futureLpOSBDn.T BRI-[gj, FRANCSIn BELGIUM;    attack by Germany on Prance and Belgium (G.I.D. Papers Nos340-B and B44-B)4  together with a Note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C.I.D. Paper No. 246-B).    The Secretary had also circulated in this connection a copy of the Covenant ofthe League of Nations  (Paper P.-106)*The Cabinet were Informed that there was no questionof a Treaty at the present time, but that all that was askedwas that a British soldier of distinction should be deputedto take part in purely technical discussions to decide whatplan should be adopted if the emergency contemplated should arise.It was suggested that once we had entered into tech-nical military conversations it would be very difficult jtoavoid entering into a definite Military Agreement.    Moreover,the experience of 1914 had shown that even military converse-in facttions were^morally binding.    The fact that such conversationshad taken place was bound to become known, and would berepresented in Parliament as the first step in a freshentangling Alliance.    It was particularly undesirable totake this step while the provisional Amglo-American guarantee to Prance was in a state of suspense and uncertainty owing Vthe failure of the United States of America to ratify theTreaty of Versailles and the Covenant of the League ofNations.Stress was also laid on the importance of reciprocityin any Agreement of this nature, and it was suggested that aBritish guarantee, which might some day become necessary,should only be given in return for some great reciprocalstipulation, such as,  for example, the adoption of a reason-able attitude by Prance and Belgium towards the revival ofGermany.       -w&apos;
such.-^Kjrrver^atmons &apos;vrerc considered-premature at the present-e-serrt time, when there is no military threat by Germany,and at the very moment when Germany was about to be disarmed.The risk was pointed out that arrangements which were nominate-ally defensive might receive an offensive development.&quot;Tie general principle that military conversations should&apos; follow and not precedd discus siens.between Governmentswas not disputed.The Cabinet agreed --That the danger was not serious *rimminent, and the proposed, military conversations Would be premature atthe present time.
X^^TThe- Cabinet- &quot;had&quot;&apos;before -thciu- Memoranda -by&quot; the-cellor of the Exchequer. (Paper CP,-1446) and the Secretaryof State for War (Paper CP.-1463) on the&apos; subject of the camp established at Baqubah,  in Mesopotamia, for the main-tenance of nearly 50,000 refugees, of whom 30*000 areChristian Assyrians from Kurdistan, and the remainderArmenians from other parts of the Ottoman Empire.If was agreedThat the Secretary of State for india should send ins t-uotions to the 1 c ce. 1Administration in Mesopotamia,that there patriation of these refugees is to be expedited to the utmost possible extent.
rrrnE 01&apos; (3)    The Cebinet had before them a Memorandum by tho1 glBISTBY!SHIPPING      Ministry of Shipping pointing out that the main powersof the Shipping Controller empire on August 31 of thisyear: that the Ministry itself must, under Section 13of the Pew Ministries and Secretaries Act, 1916,ceaso to exist twelve months after the conclusion cfthe bar,  or at such earlier date as may be fixed byOrder in Council: and encpuiring whether the Cabinetdesired to continue the powers of the ShippingController.      (0.1.1525)It was agreed -That the powers of the Shipping Controllershould not be continued after the 31st August,1920, the date authorised by the Par Emergencylaws (Continuance) Act.(4)    With reference to Cabinet 37 (20) Conclusion 8,  theCabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Shipping Con-troller (CP.1525, Part ii) dealing with the allocation of ex-enemy shipping, and urging that the prices to bepaid to the Separation Commission should be the saleprices actually realised in this country, and that if this principle is departed from it may be anticipated thatthere will be a very heavy loss to the country.      In viewof a prospective heavy fall in values, it was imperative that the Shipping Controller should be put in a positionto sell.In the course of the discussion it was pointed out thatthe ton-for-ton policy would be stultified unless each country could secure the disposal to its own nationals ofthe ships allocated to it.    This would be defeated by aninternational sale. On the other hand, it would be the dutyof the Separation-Commission to secure the best possiblevalue for Germany&apos;s assets, and that this could only be doneby insisting on an open market for the sale of the ships.The Cabinet agreed -To request Sir 1.Worthington Evans to take up and decide the matter with Sir.J,Bradbury during the forth-coming Conferences at Brussels and Spa.
(5) The-GabinetNjiad &quot;before the-;.- the draft of a Bill to beimrtrpdaioed. in the House of lords by Lord .Monteagle on thefollowing day, entitled &quot;The Dominion of Ireland Bill&quot;,drawn up with the intention of granting a Constitution toIreland broadly on the lines of the Constitutions of the self-Governing Dominions (Paper CP.-1539).After a short discussion, the Cabinet agreed  That the House of Lords should be invitedto defer its consideration of this subjectuntil the Government1s Home Rule Dillcomes before that House.
i^IrOYMENT (6)    ,v&apos;ith reference to Cabinet 36 (20), Conclusion:SuB,nICS BILL.3,  the Cabinet were informed that,  in the course oi thenegotiations arising out of the Cabinet&apos;s recentdeoision,  it had been found that there would be verygreat opposition from the Labour I arty to the amendmentincorporating the friendly Societies and also to theproposal to increase the weekly contributions of employersand ermployed (but \without any increase in the state contribution)  so as to secure 18/- for men and 15/- forwomen with a reduced waiting period of 3 days.The opponents pointed out that ynder the existing scheme the Sts.te contribution was one-fourth and the new scheme suggested by the Cabinet made the contribution ofthe State one-sixth.The Cabinet were informed that much opposition would probably be removed if the benefits were allowed toremain as they ere in the original Bill and if thecontributions of employers and men were raised from 3d to4d and of women from 2-g-d to 3d and of women&apos;s employersfrom 2-g-d to 5fVd. leaving the State contribution at theoriginal rate.      On the other hand, ta meet this the waiting period should be reduced to 3 days.The Cabinet agreed:(l) That the amendments dealing with the friendly societies should be left to a free vote of theHouse.(2) That the Minister of Labour should be authorisedto agree to the other suggestions outlined above,provided that no increased cost tc the Sccheouerwas involved.

Venizelos, the Greek President of theCouncil, whose views are summarised in Appendix III.As a result of this discussion the following action was concerted:-(a) M. Veniaeloe undertook to send instruc-tions for all preliminary arrangements to be made for the concentration,  onthe receipt of further orders from him, atDedeagatch, of one of the Greek Divi-sions in Western Thrace, with a viewto its being placed at the disposal ofGeneral Milne:
(b) M.

An immediatecurtailment of British responsibilities was indispensableif grave risk of disaster was not to be incurred.  Shouldthe Cabinet decide to continue the attempt to maintainsimultaneously our existing, commitments at Constantinople,Palestine, Mesopotamia and Persia, the possibility ofdisaster occurring in any or all of these theatres must be faced, and the likelihood, of this will increase every day.After an exhaustive discussion of the military andpolitical situations in Mesopotamia and Persia, the Confer-ence, without reaching final conclusions, agreed -(a) That the Secretary of State for india should ask Sir Percy Cox to return homeas scon as possible:(b) That the Secretary of State for india should be empowered to authorise theannouncement already suggested (paper c.P.-1475, p.-a)  ( See Appendix ..PV),subject to the agreement of Sir percy cox?    all reference to the League ofnations being omitted:(o) That further decisions in regard to persia and Mesopotamia, and in regard to the related financial, military and airquestions, should be postponed.The Secretary of State for War obtained the Prime Minister&apos;s authority to forward to the Secretary a list of the decisionsurgently required from a military pointof view.

STATEMENT BY THE CHIEF CF   THE IMPERIALGENERAL STAFF._The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that from the telegrams which had been received it would appearthat the Turkish Nationalist Army was attacking the Britishpos itis-ii&apos;   on the Ismid    Peninsula.      This position&apos;-   was35of an extent of /   miles and the- 6 &quot;battalions which wereavailable there were very weak.in numbers.    It was true thatthe Nationalist Army was composed of irregular troops whowere not formidable as compared with the British and german troops who had been fighting tin:the late war, but there was great difficulty In preventing the emissaries from the opposing    forces slipping through our lines and upsettingthe population in the rear.    Unless it was possible to re-inforce tho British troops holding this line he thought it quite possible they would have to fall back.    If this had to  &quot;bo SanaGonJ-lilne would probably tako up a line some ten to 15 milesBosphorous the enofrom the      /     which would be shorter than/he was no?/holding.    In order to ensure the troops at General Milne^disposal being able to hold on in their present positionhe thought it would be necessary to reTnforce them with atleast one Division to start with, and     ,.-   further reinfOrce-ments - would- be necessary later on.    He was very doubtful whether warships could assist in the operations asthe ground was very broken.    The Turkish Nationalist army was In occupation of the southern coastline of the Sea ofMarm *.ra and on the southern side of the Dardanelles therewere two British battalions and there was really no reason why these should not be driven into the sea if the forces under Mustapha Kemal chose to attack them.   He felt,, there-fore, very uneasy about this isolated force and would very
much like to see-it -relnforeed.    On the Gallipoli Peninsulr..the French had one battalion.   He thought the position ofthis French &quot;battalion was fairly secure, as the warshipscould prevent any of the Turkish Nationalist troops fromcrossing the Dardanelles or Sea -of Marraora.    He was alittle uneasy as to the possible situation which might arise as to the feeding of the population of Constantinople,as he thought It was quite probable that the nationalist forces might stop any supplies from reaching the tmwn bythe Anatolian Railway.,, and, bhibs...,nif;ht result In s eriousInternal trouble.    General Milne was cf opinion thatfor the moment vb^ could/deal with the situation-on-im,j,(?onst&amp;stii3rK?ple., 7..&apos; .* with the troops at his disposal--tagethe^ i^tlmth^assistance of the Fleet hut ne-was decidedly of the oplmdsonthat he    could not with the troops at his disposal carryout this work and at the same time ensure the security\ofthe Insmid   Peninsulai, and the southern side of theDardanelles,and that was why he was asking to be allowedat once to have the battalions from Batoum.    If the Bnitishforces lost the coa3t of the Ismid    Peninsula - it was hard to say what the position of Constantinople might be as itwould be possible for the Nationalist forces to shell thetown night o.n&amp; day.   Moreover, the Bosphor       would be closedand it would be more than likely that the population would get out of hand.    If the Turkish Nationalist Army    ere byany chance to seize the Chamk side of the Dardanelles thesituation would be even still more difficult.    He saw noreason why   Mustapha Kemal should not In a bout six w^eks1time have some 40,000 troops at his disposal.    If he (theC.I.G.S.) were in the position of Mustapha Kemal he wouldadvance against Chanak at once.    The whole situation de-pended on what the Commander of the Turkish NationalistArmy decided to do now and he would like to call serious
attention to the fact that unless&quot; the-tr^aops in thet Constantinople area^at Chanaksand on the Ismid $ Pendnaula1r*)were strongly reinforced it was quite possible that xtomight have a disaster.    One battalion had already been or-?dered from Malta to General Milne&apos;s command and one cavalry regiment from Palestine.    There were also two battalionswhich could be brought from Batoum and possibly two additionalnative battalions could be withdrawn from Palestine.    He wasnot  at all sure, however, that these reinforcements wouldbe sufficient and he -would not feel easy in his mind unlessreinforcements of one Division could be sent to constantinople and Ismid&apos;  and one or two brigades to reinforce the troops on the southern side of the Dardanelles.    If the French and italians, or both, could be got to hedrp so much the better.He did not think, however? there was any chance of gettingBrench troops proper as they would not leave France *The Greeks had 6 Divisions in the Smyrna area and three *n the maritza.   He was a little doubtful, however, as to whether the greeks were not a little optimistic as to what it was in their power to do.    He had discussed the situation on the previous evening with M. Veniselos and he had asked him if the Mreekforces in the Smyrna area were strong enough to advance toPanderma, as such a move would at any rate cover the forcesholding the southern shone of the Dardanelles.    M.&quot;Venlseloshad replied that he could not say, but that he would consult the Greek General Staff .-tyAs regards the possibpl/of a move from Smyrna tothe Anatolian Railway this would entail a big operation and he doubted if they could carry it out at all and in any case itwould take three to four months as the transport facilities in the country In question were most primitive, and it would be
necessary to form dumps of ammunition, for?d etc. all8 alone the line of advance.    It had to be borne in mind that 40 or 50 French battalions had just suffered a seriousreverse.   The Turkish troops might not be regarded as formidable-able if compared with the English and German troops fighting in the recent war, but operating in their own rough Countryhe would like to say that they were in his opinion difficultopponents to deal with.    If the Greeks contemplated an operation against Panderma it might be possible to landsome of them there hy sea,    He doubted, howver, if theywould be able to withdraw very many troops either from the smyrna area or from those on the Maritza and any rei nf orce-ments Y/hich they would require to carry out such an opera-tion would, he thought, have to come from Greece.    TheTurkish. Kationalist Array were not in possession cf any artillerythat could be regarded as really s serious and most of theirgunsaiKimm were, he thought, of a light type.   Still, they couldshel*    small steamers passing up the Straits, If they werein possession of the southern approach.He did not thinkthatthere was any/doubt the Greeks could advance to the ChataljaStarting from the Maritzaline/, this would take, no doubt, a little time but if it wascarried out it would certinly be a great help.   He would liketo raise the question of further reinforcements since if a division was moved to Constantinople it would practically mean in his opinion starting another war with Turkey and possiblyRussia later on.   Moreover, it might lead to further fighting in Mesopotamia.    The result of doing tieis might therefore bevte commit ourselves to a heavy charge in the way of sol-diers both for occupying the demilitarized zone in Turkey andel so operations in Mesopotamia and Persia, and might eventuallyrequire a great number of Divisions.   Whether eventually the
the situation which he had    .n mind would lead on not to a war with Afghanistan he could not say,but if this did happen at least another 3 to 5 divisions would be required.    What he wanted to explain was that the mere reinforcements we: were to send into the theatre of operations the more the fighting was likely to extend,  andto give a small Illustration   he would like to point outthat 12 months  ago one Italian battalion had remained withnowno difficulty at Konia whereas xxixikx 6 British battalionsw re being hard pressed on the Ismid    Peninsula .   His own opinion was that the operations would continue for several years and although it would be p/great help to get the Greeksto come to our assistance no?.&apos; he did not think that such a move would really solve the problem.    He thought palestine was undoubtedly the best place from which to draw on forBritish, reinfohcements at the moment.   He thought that it wouldbe safe to use the Indian troops who were serving in Palestine.As regards Mesopotamia he did not think that it wouldbe possible to continue holding the area which we at present occupied with the number of troops at our disposal.-   It wasnot that he  expected an a cthal attack but he foresawthe country ^       getting very unsettled,, the railways would be cut and everyone v/ould have to move about under escorts t andfor these reasons he did not think that with the troops atpresent available it v/ould be possible    to continue to holdMozu and if. it was intended to do this reinforcements would benecessary.As regards withdrawing,.it was very difficult tosay what effect any retirement would have as everyone knew what a retirement meant when carried out inf ront of a nativeenemy.    The whole problem really ought to be treated as one.thatHe did not think jtrl h the forces at present in Mesopotamiait would be possible to carry out&apos; an offensive operation with
a view to gaining a success as all the different  f v,y*a*?.ti(m therewere very weak and immobile.      He thought that in order tosecure the territory new held in Mesopotamia at least anotherdivision would be necessary and this division would have to be a mobile one.     If such forces were available it would be possibleroughlyto handle/the Arabs and Kurds,     There was, howevers naplace from which such a division could be obtained except from persia and there&quot; 3W^-xtheJ&amp; roughly a division and a largenumber of motor cp*s whietl $ould be made  available *     If these forces were transferred to Mesopotamia ho thought there would befor the present no difficulty in dealing with the situation/,but that wouldmean leaving^rsla entirely e,     Again,  as regards the latter country if we were to remain on there in our present position it wouldthebe necessary to reinforce /troops  already there8     Broadly thesituation wasp our forces were too weak in the Constantinoplearea and also too weak In Mesopotamia, a nd there was roally noplace from which reinforcements could be drawn for Mesopotamiaexcept Persia^     He did not think that with the troops at present available it would be possible to hold on in either Mesopotamiaor Persia for another 6 months, even if the situation were onlyview-ed from the point of view of the soldiers themselves, .and from a military point of view his own personal opinion was that all the troops should bo withdrawn from Persia and sent to Mesopotamia^
APPENDIX   II.VIEWS EXPRESSED BY AIR MARSHAL alR H.M.TEEHCHARD,Bart. K.C.B.,D.S.O.s  Chief of Air staff.AIR MARSHAL SIR H.M.TE3NCHAED said that he viewed with nolittle uneasiness the situation from an Air point of view0    Forexample,  if the squadron asked for by General Milne was to beprovided, this could only be done by taking more than one Squadronaway from Egypt.    The situation in Egypt appeared rather more quietthan a few months ago, but he thought that nevetholess the V7arOffice would be unwilling to release any Air units from the^egypt/tiangarrison,  as these were the minimum considered necessary until thesituation became more defined.    Out of the two Squadrons in mesopotamia and Persia one could only regard about one third of the aeroplanesas being available for operations.    This is due to the fact thatthe oquadrons are split up into small detachments and in keeping aPlight at Kasvin,  300 miles from its base, out of the 6 machinesprobably only two-would be available.    The allotment of aeroplanesunder the new organisation was now being carried out, and those for mesopotamia were mn their way there now.    Ireland was asking for moreaeroplanes at the moment, and it was not possible to find thertuAgain, there was the possibility of trouble in India.    The ostab-lishment of the ^ir ioroe in that place at the present time was onlythe absolute minimum for normal purposes, and in the event of anytrouble arising aerial reinforcements up to five Squadrons might be demanded.    These could not be found from Egypt, and there were noother Reserves which could be drawn upon.    In order to provide aReserve of Squadrons during the next 12 to 18 months it would benecessary to know at once what additional number of squadrons was going to be authorised, and it was for this reason that the authori-saticn of a minimum iioyal Air Force Reserve of five Squadrons hadalready been suggested.    He was of opinion that the two PIightK now available in Persia should be transferred to Mesopotamia^ as thebest use of them could be made in the latter place,  and verylittle use could be made of them in Pera&amp;a.
appendix.Ill .viipps emppmssed BY k, venizelos .n. Venizelos said that a Greek Division could at once be put at the disposal of General Hilne. if H.P.. Government so desired .      It could be taken from tho troops who were in western Thrace,      In addition to these troopc his Governmenthad six divisions in Asia minor.     As regards the questionwhich had been asked him by the Secretary of State for Paron the previous evening about a possible advance towardsPanderma, he had telegraphed to the Greek General Staff inorder to find out their views.      In doing so he had suggestedstopping the proposed operations in Pastern Thrace and re-infcrcing the troops in the Smyrna area from those now inThraoe.      Of course if one Greek Division were now       sentto Constantinople and Ghanak this division would not beavailable. .     There appeared to him to be two alternatives,the first of which was to send - one Greek Division tc reinforceGeneral Milne&apos;s troops in Constantinople and at Chanak,  and atthe same time to consider the possibility of carrying cut asmall operation in the Smyrna area in order to relievepressure elsewhere3 and the other was to reinforce the troopsin the Smyrna area with a view to carrying out a big operationtowards Panderma.       Be did not think there was any use inashing his General Staff whether it was possible to send a division to Constantinople and at the same time carry outthe big operation.       He was quite ready to arrange for the division which it was proposed to send to Constantinoplebeing handed over to General Milne to do what he liked with.If it was agreed that this division should go,, orders should
be is sued at onoe in order that they night start thed.r pTMwp^rartlorierand that transport should be obtained.      If they could haveBritish aid in obtaining transports it would, mean that thetroops could get quicker to their destination.     The Greekshad altogether,  in organised units,  some 130,000 men and of these90*000 v/ere in  the Smyrna area and 4-0,000 In Thrace.      Inaddition there v/ere some 30)000 or 4-0,000 in denote.      fnvproposal to mobilise additional troops raised a big question and in order to take any measures of this description he mouldxxkx have to consult    his country.    He did not anticipate,however, any difficulty in getting the- support of the Greekpeople if it was put  to them that It was a guest ion of enforcing the Treaty of Peace with Turkey, and especially if  it were known that the British Government were behind, then.      He thoughiIn such circumstances it would bo possible to raise an additional4- divisions who would number about 50*000 men, making the totalnumber of men available 330,000.      He had. no information as towhat guns and ammunition were in the possession of the turkish nationalist Army.     He was quite sure that the Greek troops wouldbe able to operate with success against the Turks but in sayingthis he did. nob contemplate following the enemy up into the mountain regions, and the only danger to Greece was the pro-prolongation of the  existing state of affairs with its economicresults.     He thought that in the event of trouble with the bulgarians the Serbians would adhere to their&apos;Treaty with greece and give them their moral support, but he doubted if they could expect any support from Serbia in the way of actual men.-a-
