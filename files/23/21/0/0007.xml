i r64Bi^* ^ With-reiN^nce- to Cabinet S3 (so), C^mcOuslon 4,QATOi^B.        the Cabinet had b^forj^taem^ SecretaryMXnel^ EAftfc,.   of State for War (Paper CP.-1194) enclosing a telegram*dated April 26, 1920 (No.G.C.554), from the General OfficerConima^ndling, Constantinople, and asking for a definite deci-slen in regard to the withdrawal of the force,   of one &quot;Britishand one Indian Battalion from saturn.The consideration of this Memorandum gave rise to a discussion over the whole field of British policy in theMiddle Bast, from the eastern shores of the Mediterranean tothe borders of India.    In regard to the western part of this great area it was pointed out that the .Treaty of Peace with turkey would be a very hard one, and it was recognised thatit was almost certain to arouse resistance.    Ill Thrace,Smyrna and the Straits it should be possible to deal withthis resistance, but this was not the case in Asia Minor,where hostilities appeared to be inevitable.   The evacuation of Batum at the present moment would tend to stiffen theattitude of Mustapha Kemal and his supporters.In the eastern half of the area under consideration the Cabinet were informed that the Secretary of State forWar insisted on withdrawing our forces from Enzeli, which,in the course of- the discussion, it was mentioned were cost-ing  2,000,000 a year.   This would open northern Persia tothe Bolsheviks and probably involve the fall of the presentfriendly Persian Government,  and would jeopardise our policyin,Persia.   We were also about to withdraw British indian forces from Meshed, where their retention had undoubtedly been a deterrent to the Bolsheviks in following up intoPersia their successes in Transcaspia.    It was difficult to judge what the reactions of these retirements might be onthe situation in India.    It was not contended that the eyac-nation of Batum by itself would produce these serious cc    e--quences in the Middle East, but Batum happened to be, a*the moment, a symbol of the British and Allied interest-1-
It was, h^weve^^rto^Iae^^ the evacuation of Batum, at this moment, would produce the worst and mostimmediate c-ons^q-uenoes .    Since the withdrawal of the british army of Occupation in the Caucasus, our policy had been toencourage the creation of independent States there.    Early inthe present year ih had been decided to assist these states with war material and officers,  but,  for military or financial reasons, little had been done in this respect.    Since the collapse of General Denikin, the Bolsheviks had penetratedinto Azerbaijan, which had made tw resistance.    The Bolshe-boisheviks were now believed to have approached Georgia and Armeniawith a view to an arrangement, but so far the Georgians andArmenians had resisted their blandishments.    If the british forces were withdrawn from Batum, there wa3 little doubt thatGeorgia and Armenia,would virtually go over to the Bolsheviks.It was recalled that the Supreme Council had decidedat San Remo that Batum should remain a Georgian port, providedthat Georgia could be induced to enter into an arrangement with Azerbaijan and Armenia whereby Batum would serve as a port for all three countries.

lethe Chief of tinImperial General*&apos;^t^f-Tj^-^r the---mom-snt-vout of touch with,the Foreign Office was incorrect, as the Foreigri-Office had several times on that day asked, to see thia very telegrambefore it was sent.      It was suggested,  however,  that eviden?of iromediate danger was not great.    It was recalled that thequestion had arisen at San Remo, when it had been decided torefer it for advice to Admiral de Robeck, who happened to be visiting Batum, and Admiral de Robeck had been authorised,if he considered the British troops to be in imminent dangerirjfconcert with General Milne ts withdraw them.    The Admiral,however,  in his telegram dated April 37, had stated thatthere was no immediate danger at Batumi, as the nearest &quot;Red&quot;forces had great difficulties to contend with.    Further,Ceneral Milne, in his telegram dated April 26, had statedthat the proper defence of Eaturn lay in the passes of theCaucasus.It wag urged that the Polish successes against theBolsheviks might be expected to react *jn the Caucasus front.It was suggested that the Bolsheviks had never-diopflayed anyspecial desire to interfere with the independent CaucasianStates,3i$H that at the present moment, when negotiationsfor trade between Great Britain and Russia were impending,they had every reason for not attacking a town which washeld by British troops.    It was recalled that at San RemoM. Millerand and M.  Nitti had undertaken to hold in readinesa French and Italian Battalion respectively to send to Batumwhen the word was given.    In these circumstances it was strongly urged that no immediate withdrawal should be under-taken .The wider grounds on which the retention of Batumhad been advocated were criticned from the point of view thathe decisions to withdraw from the Caucasus and later towithdraw from the Caspian had rendered inevitable the loss
...   V- 67of Eritiah^-arkL^ -regions, aridreally involved the retirement of the British line of reseatance to the railheads of the Mesopotamian and Indian systems.In view of this great decision,  the maintenance of emaildetachments,such as the forces at Batum, was of no permanentvalue, and it was better to recognise the inevitable marchof events and to make the withdrawal complete, accepting thelogical consequences  of the larger decision, the wisdom ofwhich was not criticised.    It was admitted that it might bepossible    to hold Batum for a few weeks more without disaster ,ovacua!ionbut sooner or later xt would have to be evacuated.    If/     hadto take place at the last moment, as at Novorossisk, it wouldprobably be found that, in addition to the British forces, allsorts of people who had compromised themselves in one way or another would have to be withdrawn also.    There was also thedanger of a rising in the town of Batum itself.    In thisconnection,  during the discuss -m a caveat was uttered againstthe danger of postponing action of this kind.    After everypostponement the situation was apt to become worse, and the risks of withdrawal,  and the objections thereto,  greater.Although it might not cost much more to keep a Battalion atBatum than at Constantinople or elsewhere.,  nevertheless inthe aggregate the retention of forces at such placca as Batum,Enzeli and Meshed,  cost a good deal, of money which was not provided for in the Budget Estimates,    If these estimates were exceeded, the reduction of debt would not be achieved,and there would have to. be further taxation in future years,the consequences of which would be very serious.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff read a telegramfrom General Mine,  dated May 2nd, in which he stated thatthe position at Batum was not only militarily unsound butPiold Marsha&quot;&apos; Wi] sondangerous&quot;.     ,   pointed out that it was not only necessaryto defend Batum but to feed the civil population,  otherwise the.,-town., would not be held.    If it was decided to hold the
ourselves respecting^nsJibae-^^ not only the BritishoivdiiAnAPeptilation,  and the wives and families of officers,but some SO,000 to 30,000 Georgians.    These points were apt to arise suddenly at the last moment.After a considerable discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the  Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should press the French and italian governments immediately to fulfil their undertaking to send each a Battalion toBatum without delay:(b) That the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff should notify the above decisionto General Milne, and should state thatthe Cabinet desired,  for reasons connectedwith the Turkish Peace Treaty,  to retain the forces at Batum unless this involvedactual risk.      It  should be made quite clear, however, that General Milne had full authority&apos;to withdraw the forces ifthey were threatened with actual danger:(c) That the  Chief of the Imperial  GeneralStaff should be authorised to^ inform general Milne that he should incur&apos;no obligation,  in the event of a withdrawalcf the British forces,   to embark Georgiansor any persons other than the british garrison and British civilians:(d) That the Secretary of State  for ForeignAffairs should communicate these decisions to the High Commissioner at Constantinople.
If BKTBISH$RGBS INIt was recalled&apos;that on February 9th. the CabinetCommittee on Finance had decided,  on financial grounds,  onthe immediate and entire withdrawal of the force ef approxi-mately 1,700 men at Meshedj under General Malleson,  togetherwith the troops on trie lines of communication of this force(Cabinet Finance Committee;  19th Minutes,   Conclusion 3).Both the Foreign Office and India Office had doubted,the wisdom of this withdrawal,  on military and political grounds, and a series of telegrams had been exchanged withthe Indian Government to ascertain whether they were preparedto share the cost of the retention of some force in north persia.    The result  of these telegrams had been that theIndian Government favoured withdrawal and could not make anysubstantial contribution to the maintenance of this force.On the eve of Lord Cursor&apos;s departure for San Remothe subject had been further considered by the Tnterdepart-mental Conference on Eastern Affairs,  as the result of which,correspondence had been exchanged between the Secretary ofState for India and the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.    This correspondence had been taken to indicatethat -t-he latter was still doubtful as to the expediency ofthe withdrawal.    The issue of final instructions had, there-fore,  been held over until Lord curzon&apos;s return.It was explained that the War Office estimates didnot provide any funds for the maintenance of the force,and that the Indian Government was unwilling to contribute.The statement of the Indian Government that five months would be required for the withdrawal was severely criticised,(2.) With, . reference--to- Cabinet 10 (SO), Conclusion 1, theCabinet had before then the following- documents relating to the  withdrawal of British troops from Persia:-A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor war (Rawer&quot; CP,-1101),A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor India (Paper CP,-1300),   covering a series of telegrams exchanged betweenthe Secretary of State and the indian government...
ifvrparticularly&quot; in., view cf-the Tact that the cost in the mean-time would fall on War Office funds.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State for india should inform the  Indian Government thatthe Cabinet had re-affirmed the previous decision that the forces should be witin-drawn from Meshed, and should instructthem to withdraw the force as  soon aspossible,  stating that the Cabinet couldnot accept five mcnths as a reasonab1eestimate of the time required:(b) To approve the Government of India&apos;recommendation as  regards the retentionof the Consular Escorts,  namely,  1^ CavalrySquadrons at Meshed,  and ijj Squadron atSeicteio,  some light armoured, cars atMeshed and,  possibly, Ford Pan transport.ESOPOTAhlA. (S) With reference to Finance Committee, 19th Minutes,Conclusion 2 3  the desire was expressed that,  in view of thegreat cost of the Army of Occupation of Mesopotamia, thesubject should be discussed by the Cabinet at an early date.-The Secret ary of State for War and Air stated his proposals were nearly ready and could be discussed by theCabinet in the following week.T&quot; ZT P&apos;. CTIvNS (4) With reference to- Cabinet 17 ( 0),  Conclusion 4, theTO THE E JTISHSENIOR NAVAL Cabinet had before them a- Memorandum by the Admiralty raisingOFFICER IN THE;BALTIC IN THE the question as to what action the British Naval Forces shouliEVENT of AG-SPSS SIGN BY     take in the event of Bolshevist naval aggression against the-THE BOLSHEVISTI FLEET AGAINST Baltic States (Paper CP,.-1209).I THE BALTICI STATES. The Cabinet did not accent the suggestion in theAdmiralty Memorandum that the Allied policy of February 24thiswas inconsistent with the Instructions approved on March 31stto the Senior Naval Officer in the- Baltic.    The policy ofFebruary 24th had declared that, in the event of the Soviet,Government taking offensive action against the Baltic States,the Allies would give the latter their support.    The instr- 7-tions to the Senior Naval Officer had merely laid down tP-he was not to take offensive, action against the Bolshevistfleet, and had not precluded the possibility of action insupport of the Border States if attacked.
.    71After hearing Admiral L^rd Beatty in amplificatiorof the views of the Admiralty as stated in the Memorandabefore them, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of state for ForeignAffairs should fake steps to remind theBolsheviks of the decision of the AlliedGovernments that,  in the event  of attacksbeing made by Soviet Russia against anyof the Border States within the limits oftheir- legitimate frontiers,  the allies would give the latter every possiblesupport.    He should intimate to theSoviet Government that any naval aggres-sion against these States would be con-strued as offensive action,  and in that event the British Fleet would be ordered to support, the State that had been attacked.\ (b) The Admiralty should give instructions tothe Senior Naval Officer in the Baltic tothe effect that naval aggression by theBolsheviks against the Baltic States wasto be regarded as offensive action,  andin that event he was authorised to take action against the Soviet Fleet,    TheAdmiralty should make it clear, however,that the British Fleet was to take no action except in the event of a definitehostile act on the part of the Bolsheviks,(c) There should be no permanent increase madeto the British Fleet in the Baltic untilthe Admiralty had reported to the Cabinettheir proposals, with an estimate of their cost,  and had obtained Cabinet approval,(d) The warning to the Bolsheviks referred toin (a) should be followed by a short cruisein the Baltic of such forces as the Adrair-alty mi^ht deem advisable for the purposeof showing the Soviet Government that theBritish Government had sufficient forces available to make good its undertaking inregard to the Baltic States,S, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1,May 5, 1920.
