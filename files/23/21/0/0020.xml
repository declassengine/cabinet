(1)    The Cabinet agreed -To appoint the following Committee toassist the Viceroy and the Chief Secre-tary for Ireland in dealing with qm.es-determination  arising in connection with. Ireland:-The First Lord of the Admiralty  (Chairman),The Lord President of the Council,The Lord Ghano el or,The Secretary of State for1 &quot;&apos;ar,The Minister&quot; of Education,The Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty,Captain L,f.

(?,) The Cabinet had under consideration what action,  if arshould be taken in regard to Archbishop Maiinixj the HunanCatholic Archbishop of Melbourne, who has left Australiaand,  it is reported, will not return the re*    in Australiahe has been delivering speeches of a violently anti-Britishcharacter, and there is every reason to suppose that, ifpermitted to land in Ireland, he will resume this practice.There is also some reason to believe that he may be madeArchbishop of Dublin.In view of the serious effect which they were informedwould be produced on public opinion in Ireland by prohibit: -gthe Archbishop froa&apos;. landing in Ireland, the Cabinet could notsanction this procedure.It was agreed -That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should follow up the representa-tions he had already made to the Vaticanon this question,  and indicate the undesir-ability,in flic present acute state of Irishaffairs,  of appointing as Archbishop of dublin a person of pronounced and publicly-proclaimed anti-British sentiments,    Heshould also suggest to the Vatican thedesirability,  if possible,  of findingsome employment  for Archbishop Marmixoutside tha United Kingdom;
l,./&apos;8TN0 (3) Tith reference: to - Cabinet 36 (30), Conclusion 2,the..Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the minister ofintension of period of Health on the subject of grants to private builders (Papergubdidy to private CP.-1514).guilders .The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the proposal of the Ministerof Health,  endorsed by the Housing Commit-tpe, * hat, vri.th.ovit varying the amount of 15,000,000 authorised&quot;&apos;by Parliament forthe purpose of granting subsidies to private bulldera of houses, tbe period should be extended tc December 31, 1921:(b) That the minister of Health should announce that the Government proposed to introduce legislation-for the purpose of extending the period.
(4) With reference to Sar Cabinet 514, Conclusion 4. and home Affairs Committee 20, Conclusion 5f. the Cabinet hadbefo-e them the following documents a Memorandum by the Minister of Labon-(Paps- CP,-1567),A memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(Paper CP.-1425),A Memorandum by the minister of Pensions(Paper CP.-1455) ,A Memorandum by the LJinistep of Labour1(Paper C.P.-1448).The Cabinet were informed that about 3,400 vroirien hadbeen trained, and a similar number were in training, underthe Government scheme.    These xvomen were drawn chiefly fromex-munition workers and the members of various Women&apos;a Corpsorganised during the War.    It had been arranged in december last that the training schemes should terminate on June 50,1920, and the Cabinet were no&quot; asked to extend the period by six months, at an estimated additional cost of  150,000.An expenditure of  2,50,000 had already been sanctioned for theperiod ending June 30.    Between  40,000 and  50,000 of this amount would remain unexpended on that date,.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the LabourExchange figures, which showed that,whereas there were48,000 unemployed women registered, there were vacanciesfor 45,000;    but. it was pointed out that these figures didnot fully represent the total number of women unemployed.It was stated that the Treasury, in agreeing to theextension to June 30 had in mind that it was easier to terminate the scheme in summer than in winter.The Cabinet agreed  -To extend the life of the Training Schemebeyond June 50 for such period as wouldexhaust the  moO,000 already granted.
;    (5) With reference ** ^- Cabinet 514. Conclusion 4, theCabinet had before the:; the following documents:-Memoranda by the Minister of Labour(Papers C,1.-1315 and C.p.-1315 A)i\ Me^&apos;0&quot;anduro by the Chancel] or of theExchequer (imp-- CP.-1425).The Cabinet were asked to approve a scheme for thetraining of 100 ex-Service men as puddlers, at a cost of 2,200.    It was explained that  this scheme, while small initself, was an important departure and might ultimatelyinvolve the training of a very much larger number, estimatedat 40,000 and costing- at least  6,000,000, a figure whichwould certainly be increased if the men had to be put in special training centres and not confined to the works ofemployer*e .Attention was drawn to the Manifesto which had beenissued by the Prime Minister and Mr Bonar Paw before thelast General Flection, which was being construed by ex-Service men as an unqualified pledge to provide training forevery ex-soldier,  including the able-bodied, who required,it.    While over 5,000,000 men from His Majesty&apos;a Forces hadbeen re-absorbed into industry, there still remained 200,000fit ex-Service men unabsorbed and congregated chiefly inthe large cities.    At present their discontent was restrainedby the receipt of Unemployment Benefit at the rate of  1 per-week, but * his would shortly cease and the discontent wouldcertainly become much more acute.The Cabinet considered the difficulties which would arise, if unemployment presently became much wore widespread,in dK discriminating between ex-Service mac who had beenabsorbed and had since become unemployed, and those whohad never been absorbed in industry.    The demand for train-ing might,  in ouch circumstances, become so general as tobe impossible to meet.    Doubt was also expressed as towhethe&quot; the Training Schemes were the best solution of thedifficulty.    In any cas--,  it was contended that new expend!-mure
could only be contemplated as the result of drastic economies in some other direction:    for example, in the abolition ofthe Bread Subsidy.T he Ca binet agreed  (a) That the following Committee should consider and report to the&apos;Cabinet en the question of abolishing the Bread Subsidy, with special reference to any reaction such policy mightha*re on existing wage agreewentg:--  The President of the Board of T-ade  (Chairman),The Minister of Labour,The Minister of Food,A Representative of the Treasury,lor Pembroke &apos;?icxs (Secretary),The Committee should examine the policies which had been adopted in regard to breadsubsidies in F-ance and Italy,  and should furnish the Cabinet with a Report thereon,together with particulars of the comparativeconsumption of b-ead in these countries andin the United Kingdom:(b) That the attention of the Irish Committee(see Conclusion 1 above) should ha called to the figures of unemployed ex-Servicemen in the chief towns of Ireland, set outby the Minister of Labour in Paper CP.-1493,nnwe 5, with a view to the possible recruitment of these men for His majesty&apos;s Forces:(c) To adjourn the discussion of the training offit ex-Service men until the  Report of theCommittee on the Bread Subsidy hid beenreceived.(6)      The Cabinet tool note of a memorandum bythe Minister of labour,  reviewing thevarious schemes  for the training of dis-abled men, interrupted apprenticeships,and fit ex-Service men unemployed (paper cp.-1493) .-6
? SETTLEMENT OF EX-SERVICEMEN IN ENGLAND AND WALES



(7) With reference to War Cabinet 549, Minute 1, and War Cabinet 631, Minute 1, the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (Paper C.F. 1459) dealing with the applications for small holdings from ex-Service men. The applications already received were more than sufficient to exhaust the money available, and, as they were still coming in at the rate of 1,500 a month, of which over 80 per cent were being approved, it was necessary for the Cabinet to review the position and either be prepared to face fresh expenditure or to tell the County Councils to refuse further applications Up to the present, 14,000 men had either been actually settled upon the land, or land had been purchased for them. In addition, there were already 8,500 approved applicants for whom on provision had been made. The gross cost of settlement, if continued, would probably not be less than about £12,000,000 per annum. In 1926 the holdings would be re-valued, and the County Councils would take them over at their then rental value and the deficit upon them would be written off.

The Cabinet recognised that the land settlement policy was one to which the Government were deeply pledged and was a policy which commanded considerable support in the House of Commons. The Cabinet agreed:-

(a) To authorise the Minister of Agriculture to inform the County Councils that, having regard to the condition of the building trade throughout the country, it was undesirable to continue at present buying unequipped land for settlement when it was not possible to provide houses and other equipment except after prolonged delay and at an unreasonable cost.


(b) The County Councils should bo enjoinednot to create any new holdings for civilian applicants and should give special preference to nen who had servedoverseas as against nen who had served athome.(c) That the above decision should not prejudice the position of the 8,500approved applicants who should be accomodated as economically as possible.(d) The Minister of Agriculture s.. in giving effect to tho above, should confer with the Secretary for Scotland and the chief secretary for Ireland, so as to secureuniformity of actiono(,o)    The Minister of Agriculture should con-sider tho possibility of reducing the siaoof the holdings, of making an appealto landowners for land, on especiallyfavourable terms, and of offeringholdings to applicants, leaving to thentho provisinn-of houses and e-quipnent    -should(f) The Minister J  submit a further memorandum to the Cabinet on the revised proposals before taking the action specifiedin (a) and (b) above. &quot;   .(g) The question of authorising the Ministerof Agriculture to instruct the CountyCouncils not to accept for considerationunder the present scheme any further ..,applications after an early date was intho meantime deferred*

IAS (3) With..reference to Cabinet 29 (20),  Conclusions 5 and[PPIKG .6, the Cabinet had before there a 1,&apos;ernorandun by the ShinningControlle&quot; dealing with the policy of the Australian Governmerit in regard to certain German steamships which had been- seized during the Tar. The Prime minister of Australia had intimated his intention of retaining these ships for australian -laa, and of claiming for a still larger amount, of tdhhage^imoIn this connection the attention of the Cabinet was called to the uneasiness felt in French circles as to british policy generally in connection with the German ships, and tothe danger that if we sold ships in a restricted market atar, unduly low price,, the Reparation Commission would refuseto recognise such price and would ask that it should be supplemented from the Imperial Treasury.The Cabinet agreed(a) To refer the matter of the German ships inthe hands of the Australian Government tothe Shipping Controller, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for the colonies and the Lord Prlw Sealt(b) To adjourn for-further consideration thequestion of an unrestricted market for thesale of ships in the hands of His majesty&apos;sGovernment; Inasmuch.as the Skipping Con-troller was circulating a fresh Memorandumon the subject (Paper C.P.-15S5)

No member of the Mili-tary Mission is on any account totake part either in directing, in organising, or in any way partial-pating in the present operation.They are to wind up their work without delay, and should be withdrawn from the Peninsula assoon as they can be collected and shipping is available.&quot;(b) That, as the Admiralty were net represented   -at the meeting, which had originally been summoned for the discussion of questionsof a different order, the Secsretary tothe Cabinet should,immediately after themeeting, see the First Lord or First sea lord, explain the situation to him, and suggest 1 on behalf of the Conference, thatthe^Admlralty should bring their instructions-tions to the Naval Commander-in-Chief into line with the above  telegram.    In particu-lar, the Secretary should suggest that instructions should be sent to the naval commander-in-Chief that our ships should remain absolutely neutral and should
E     (3) It was generally agreed that a meeting of the British- Empire Delegation should take place before the Prime Minie-ter&apos;s meeting with M. Millerand.    In view of Mr Watts&apos; resig-nation from the pest of Treasurer of the Australian Common-wealth, it would be necessary to communioate with Mr Hughes,the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, in regard to australian -lian representation.    Sir George Perley, the Canadian HighCommissioner, had been nominated to represent the Dominion.The Secretary of State for the Colonies had been nominated by&apos;the Hew Zealand Government to represent them pending the arrival of Sir James Allen, and General Smuts had given an indication of the views of the Union Government, withoutasking for special representation (Paper CP.-1347) .  *It was agreed(a) That a Meeting of the British empire delegation should be held on Friday,June 18, 1920:(b) That the Secretary should notify this to the Cabinet and to Sir George Perley:(o) That the Secretary of Stats for theColonies should telegraph to the primeMinister of Australia in regard toAustralian representation at the meetingof the British Empire Delegation.abstain from ao^ijrta-nee of any kind toGeneral Wrangel, whether-hds forces were engaged in offensive or defensive fighting.(2) With reference to Cabinet 33 (20), Conclu&amp;ion 3, the- Prime Minister stated that arrangements had been roade^oertweerv14.

AGUR op-IONS.rMmomingfrting of council.^fl^^OM8 ***** &apos;Minl-smun:T a^-a wtrte*--ox urgency; raised theKB OJirail^v^uetKtion^of British Mews Services abroad.    He had been inform-ed that before the War the principal news services on theContinent of Europe had been in German and Austrian hands,and the principal news centres had been Berlin, %rienna and constantinople.    Since the War the news services from thesecentres had passed almost entirely into French hands.    TheFrench news service was conducted mainly as French propaganda,r.       ,      , . sometime,&quot;ana French policy was belauded/at the expense of British.Reuters had now offered to establish news centres in Berlin,Vienna and Constantinople, for which purpose they would require a subsidy of  15,000 a year.    The subject could net be decided in the ab3er.ee of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but thePrime Minister wished the Departments concerned to study thequestion, with a view to ita discussion at a very early date.It was pointed out that an arrangement already existedwhereby Reuters undertook to send abroad such British news asthe Government desire.    The difficulty was, however, to getthe news published.    The question, therefore, had to be con-sidered whether this could best be achieved by the means nowproposed or by some other method.It was agreed  (a) That the question should be placed on theAgenda of a Conference of Ministers to beheld on Monday,  June 14, 1920:(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should, in the meantime, instruct the Political Intelligence Department ofthe Foreign Office to consider whether the desired object could best be achieved bysubsidising, Reuters to set up offices inBerlin, Vienna.and Constantinople, or by(c) $88 ^fee^eore%aSH should notify the Chancellor&amp;f the Exchequer,(5) As Mr Balfour was unable to be present at the forthcom-ing meeting of the Council of the League of Nations, to be1held in London on Monday, June 14, at the request of persia,to discuss the Bolshevist occupation of Enzeli, it was agreed-That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should represent the BritishGove rnment at t his me et ing.
&quot;TSH House of Commons on Thursday,  June 17,  1920.    The questionITUDEAgOS. was raised as to whether the best possible use was in factbeing made of the machinery of the League of Nations.In this connection it was pointed out that the czecho-Slovak Government had invited the Council of the League ofmen. Nations to consider the Teschen question.It was suggested that the following questions might with advantage be referred to the Council of the League ofNations under Article 11:-(a)  THE TERRITORIAL BOUNDARY BETWEEN LITHUANIAAND POLAND.;^iania. It was pointed out that Lithuania was in a very diffi-cult position in the matter.    The Lithuanians prefer theRussian people to the Poles, and believe that their future economic interests lie in Russia, On the other hand, theySSIAN^INVASIOIT (6) The Conference were informed that, with M.Kraesin&apos;s&apos; PE.&apos;-iSIA.consent,  the important and reassurina statement hp had madeas to the  Russian attitude in Persia, at the meeting held onMonday,  June 7 (I.CP.-109 B., pages 14 and 15),  had been communicated to the Secretary-General of the League of nations for the information of the Council.    It would seem probable,therefore, that the Council would advise Persia to get intocommunication with the Soviet Government, and that further action by the Council would be postponed until after these negotiations and until it was known xvhether the Soviet Govern-ment were in fact carrying out the intention,announced by M.Krassin, to leave Enzeli.It was pointed out, however, that the Persian ForeignMinister would, in all probability,  consult the Council ofthe League as to what would happen if the Soviet government did not carry out their undertakings, and. also as to theattitude which Persia should take up in regard to the probabledemand of the Soviet Government for direct representation atTeheran.i5UE OF (7)  Reference was made to the Debate to take place in the
prefer Polish to Bolshevist theories of government, andbelieve that the maintenance of Poland, with reasonablefrontiers is in the interests of -Lithuania.    But all parties agree in demanding from the Poles full recognition of lithuania-anian independence and the cession of Vilna. (For further details see telegram from Mr Tallents, Kovno, Mo.72, ofJune 8, 19g.Q.)(b)  THE QUESTION OF THE AALAND ISLANDS,which the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has repeated-ly urged on the Swedish Government ought to be referred bythem to the Council of the League of Nations.  (For further details see Lord Gurgon&apos;s despatch to Mr Barclay,, No.l,  dated.June 8,  1920;    Foreign Office Paper 202404.)(The, Prime Minister had to..leave at thisppint to keeo an important..engagement.)(8) Owing to the Prime Minister&apos;s engagement and the fore-going questions of urgency,  it was not found possible to carryout the original object of the meeting, namely, to have a preliminary discussion in regard to Persia.In a short informal discussion, great stress was laid on the importance of an early discussion on the situation in persia, Mesopotamia, Palestine, Egypt and Turkey.   attention was drawn, in particular, to the following information re-ceived within the last 24 hours(a) Information received by the War Office inregard to disturbances in the Mosul Vilayet,which had necessitated the withdrawal ofsome outlying Political Officers and mili-tary detachments.(b) Information received by the Foreign Officeand War Office as to the forthcoming with-drawal of Turkish Government troops from theIsmid area, which would leave the Britishtroops at Ismid face to face with the Turkish^National Forces, whose avowed Intention wasto advance to the Bosphorus (Telegram,from admiral de Robeok. Ho.68ft. of June 1*. 19S0).(c) Information received by the War Office to theeffect that the French are concentrating theirforoes in the Near East in Syria and Oilicia,thus leaving the British forces almost un-supported in the Constantinople area.
(d) The  slow arrival of the Italian Divioionla the Constantinople area, and the attitudeof the Italian Government, which tended tobe generally favoitrable to the turkish nationalist forces.After some discussion on the Cabinet business of thefollowing week, it was agreed. --That the whole of these questions should bediscussed by a Conference of ministers not later than Thursday, June 17th-1920*It was further agreedThat Lord Curzon should endeavour to arrangefor a postponement of the question to beraised in the House of Lords on Tuesday,June 15th j on the subject of Me s Spotami aand Persia..Phitehall Gardens, S.T.I.June 11th 1920.-6-

Division,subject to the limitation that, if the whole number ofPuisne Judges amounted to 15 or more,  any future vacanciesshould not be filled unless an Address were presented freeboth Houses of Parliament.The Lord Chancellor asked the sanction of the Confer-ence to the moving of an Address for this purpose in theHouse cf Lords and the House of Commons.    He explained thatthere was great congestion of work in the King&apos;s bench division and the Divorce Court,  owing to the demands forJudges for extra-judicial work, and to the revival ofbusiness in the Courts, which had shrunk considerablyduring the War.    A pressing request was being made by theChief Secretary for Ireland for a Judge to preside over theSpecial Tribunal to be set up under Cabinet 2.7 (20), Conclu-sion 8, and a Judge would also be required permanently toact as President of the Commission being set up under the indemnity Bill, in place of the Duke Commission.   The LordChancellor also proposed to discontinue sending an AssizeJudge to some of the smaller County T*was, there being nopossible justification for the continuance of Assizes atwhich there was no business to be done.Some doubt was expressed, however, as to the expediency,  on public grounds,  of curtailing the towns on the AssizeCircuit a .The Conference agreed  To approve the Lord Chancellor&apos;s proposal that Parliament should be asked to approve the presentation of an Address by bothnouses of Parliament under the SupremeCourt of Judicature Act,  1910,  represent-ing that the state of business in the Kxng sB^nch Division requires that the vacancies for two additional Judges should be filled.

It was explained that m. Millerand was infavour of fixing a definite sum,  and was convinced that theISO milliards of francs previously proposed was not reason-ably to be expected.    It was now suggested that the BritishGovernment should guarantee German bonds up to the amountwe receive in payment for the Army of Occupation.It was explained that a representative of the Belgian-Government had asked to meet the Prime Minister that day,ostensibly to discuss the Russian question, but it seemed probable that his real object was in connection withreparation.It was agreed that the Chancellor of the exchequer should be present at the interview,.-o.....

JDovming Street,  an Friday,  June 11,  1920,  at 5-30 p.m.,the Conference considered a proposal that Reuters should establish news centres in Berlin, Vienna and Constantinople,in return for a subsidy of  15,000 a year.It was explained that before the War the principalnews services on the Continent had been in German and Austrianhands,  and had been centred at Berlin, Vienna and Constant!-nople.    Sines the War these services had passed into Frenchhands and were being conducted as channel?; of French propa-ganda, to the detriment of British policy, the impressionbeing created throughout the Continent that France was reallythe cbuntry which mattered.On behalf of the Foreign Office it was explained that,during the War, Reuters had received  5,000 a month for continental propaganda verb.    On the conclusion of Peaceit was decided to bring this arrangement to an end and to substitute for it the system of wireless news now in opera-t ion.The Conference was reminded that,if Reuters&apos; proposals were accepted, it would, be necessary to get some control of news in Capitals like Brussels and Paris.The Conference ultimately agreed  That Mr Philip Kerr, on behalf of thePrime Minister, should request Reutersto submit a definite scheme showing,inter alia, for the period of one week,the kind&quot; of news which they propose tosupply to the foreign Press:    the scheme,when received, tc be circulated to theCabinet, with a view to further cons id-era t ion of the matter.
6g AkdttIa^s-.(5) &apos;;7itb *qfe&apos;*n^^0*h^ w (30), Appendix II (5),oommttt^. the - Confer ft no e had under consideration the following Papersrelating to the future of the Supply and Transport Committee:-A Memorandum by Sir Laming WorthlngtonEvans  (Paper 0.,1.-1255),A Memorandum by the Home Secretary(Paper CP,-1294),A Memorandum by the Pood Controller(Paper CP.-1345) .The opinion was expressed that the obvious course wouldbe to place the Supply Band&apos;&apos;Transport Committee and its Sub-Committees once more under -the control of the Minister ofTransport.    In favour of this course it was urged that,  ofthe three possible strikes which could affect deeply the life of the community (Railways, Mines, and Docks) theMinistry of Transport were intimately concerned with two;while, in the event of a miners&apos;  strike-, they would also be .concerned with the distribution of coal, which would be a vital question.    It was true that the present organisation was much smaller- than that which had been created during thestrike in September to October, 1919, but without it theGovernment of the country would be defenceless in the eventof a large strike.    The greater proportion of its work waswork in which the Ministry of Transport would have to advise,and it was only reasonable that that Department should havethe general control of the preparatory arrangements.    Itwould be equally extravagant, impracticable, and politicallyunwise to create a new Department for the purpose of perform-ing work very similar to work already performed by theMinistry of Transport in the ordinary course, especially as such work would have to be performed by the Ministry ofTransport during a strike    It would fee equally difficult toallow the Heads of Departments in the Ministry of transport to be responsible to another Minister as well as to theMinister of Transport.
In favour of the creation -of^-a--separate department for the purpose of carrying on the work of the Supply andTransport Committee, it was urged that the officials of theMinistry of Transport could not be -expected to carry out. the extra work involved in addition to their ordinary duties;that It would prejudice the Minister of Transport in the eyes of Labour- if he were made responsible for work which was.generally regarded as &quot;strike-breaking&quot; work;    and that if itwere decided that the Minister of Transport, should continue as Chairman of the Supply and Transport Committee and beresponsible for the Committee&apos;s work it1, would be necessaryfor him to be provided with additional staff.The attention of the Conference was also directed tothe Emergency Bill, which had been drafted in order to give tieGovernment the necessary powers in the event, of a grave emer--gency.After considerable discussion of the questions ofprinciple involved, the Conference agreed as follows(a) That the Minister of Transport shouldresume the Chairmanship of the Supplyand Transport Committee, and that theParliamentary Secretary to the Ministerof Transport should       once more becomeChairman of the Supply and TransportSub-Committee:(b) That if the Minister of Transport should find extra staff to be necessary in orderto enable him to carry out efficiently theduties devolving upon him in accordancewith decision (a) above, he should submithis proposals to the Chancellor of theExchequer:(a) That the Emergency Bill should be referred for examination ?p the Home Affairs Gora-dittee % more particularly from a political point of view.(Tbft^Minister of Transport desired that.bjjp dissent from this decision shouldbe recorded.)
Vvm^S WM w Cabinet 14 (2.0), Conclusion l/the)or-Pe-Nme-e had before them a Memorandum b^ the Minigte&quot; of....Agriculture (Paper CP.-1441) stating that serious criticismhad open levelled in the Honse &apos; of Commons against the allegedinadequacy of the inducements in the Agriculture Pill to growwheat at home.    The Minister of Agriculture was unwilling torecommend that the basic minimum prices specified in Clause S(1)  of the Pill should be increased, but, in view of theserious and progressive shrinkage of acreage under wheat, he recommonded that the suggestion favoured by the Royal Commis-sion, that farmers should be allowed the free play of themarket above the minimum guarantee, should be conceded, andthat the maximum prices already announced for home-grown wheat, vis,, 95/- for the crop of 19S0 and 100/- for the crop of 1921,  should be cancelled.much of the balance ofharvest- It mas pointed out that/the home-grown wheat harvested19191919,      in -  /    was nov; .     in the hands of dealers and speculators,and that the removal of the maximum price would simply putmoney info the pockets of those persons and would create a grievance in the mind of the- farmer.In these circumstances the Minister of Agriculturesaid that he did not press his proposal so far as the whoatharvested in 19pp.) was concerned.harvest- It was generally agreed that,  in the eVent of a world-] 931.shortage of wheat next year, the English farmer will eitherex-Deck to got the- average market price of imported wheat orwill still further reduce his acreage under that crop. If,as seems probable, there is a substantial increase of pricenext autumn, the loaf can only be kept at 1/- by increasingthe Bread Subsidy to  B7,000,000 per annum.With regard to the anticipated shortage,it was pointedout that Sir Auckland Geddes had recently reported that theUnited States would have little surplus to export, and/ thatthe Argentine was taking steps to -prevent the export of wheat.On the other hand, it was stated that the price cf wheat in

Any sudden announcement that theBritish farmer was to receive the market price after this cerealyear would certainly have the effect of raising prices, andwould sake it most difficult for the Food Controller to carryout his policy of reducing food prices.    It was suggested thata possible&apos; solution might be to make a firm offer of, say,120/-S Po^ next year&apos;s crop; such an offer would en-courage the farmer far more than the proposed removal of themaximum price.    On the other hand,  it was pointed out thatthis policy might mean that the Government were paying, more for home-grown wheat than for foreign wheat, and. the public would certainly regard any such proposal as a subsidy to thefa&quot;me r, &apos;On behalf of the Treasury it was&apos; pointed out that homepurchases of wheat benefited the Exchange, while,  on the otherhand, any proposal which might have the effect of raising theprice of British wheat by 30/- or 40/- must either fall onthe consumer or must increase the subsidy paid out cf theExchequer.    The Conference was reminded of the decision to limit the Bread Subsidy to  45,000,000 per annum1, on thewhole, the Treasury view was that the present difficulties were likely to continue until every impediment to higherproduction on the part of the farmer was removed.The Conference ultimately agreed  That no maximum should be imposed by theGovernment noon the price of home-grown wheat harvested in 1931.
