RESTITUTION IN SPECIE UNDER THE TREATIES OF PEACE.

(1) The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade dealing with Restitution in Specie under the Treaties of Peace (C.P.1073)

It was explained that the original intention of the British representatives at Paris had been to secure right to compensation but owing to same inadvertence in the drafting of the Treaty with Germany (Article 297 (f)(g)) it was, in the opinion of the Law Officers, open to H.M,Government to decide to exercise the right of restitution in specie.  If this right were now exercised it might conceivably be regarded by our Allies and America as almost a breach of faith on our part in view of what had taken place during the discussion of the Article. On the other hand, the Allies themselves were exercising the right of restitution in specie and it would be difficult for H.M. Government to refuse to do so and to defend such a course in Parliament, when it was understood that the Treaty did not forbid such a course. The Cabinet decided that the Board of Trade should take steps to exercise the right of restitution in specie conferred by the Treaty.
TRADE MONOPOLIES BILL AND PROFITE RING ACT AMENDMENT BILL.

(2) With reference to War Cabinet 609, Minute 1, the Cabinet had before then:

(a) Draft of a Bill for obtaining information with respect to trade monopolies and for restraining abuses thereof.

(b) Draft of a Bill to amend and extend the duration of the Profiteering Acts 1919 together with covering Memorandum and explanatory Notes by the President of the Board of Trade. (C. P. 1074).

It was explained that the existing Profiteering Act expired on May 19th and that definite pledges to continue it in an amended form had been given in the House of Commons. The Attending Bill before the Cabinet was drafted (a) to secure the help of trade organisations in the regulation of prices for particular classes of goods; and (b) to extend the original Act to any process of manufacture, to the repairing, dyeing, cleaning or washing of articles, and also to embrace the lotting of articles on hire. The general aim of the Trade Monopolies Bill was to protect the consumer against the abuses of monopoly powers, chiefly by means of publicity and by injunction and reference to a quasi-judicial tribunal, viz., the Railway and Canal Commission. In reaching a decision with regard to those Bills, the Cabinet considered:

(a) The widespread expectation of the public that the evils of profiteering would be vigourously handled.

(b) The effect of the newly-introduced Budget on the business interests represented in the House of Commons and their attitude to the new taxation proposed, and, generally, to any undue interference with trade.

(c) The great pressure of legislation already promised in the King&apos;s Speech on the available Parliamentary time.
.fo1 net d o c id e d ;(1) That tho President of the Board ofTrade should introduce tho amending bill to the Profiteering Act and shouldam rid clause    1 (3)  so as to cut end its operation and that of the PrincipalAct for tvolve months.(2) That profiteering in housing should notfoe dealt with in this Eill, hut shouldbe considered by the Minister of health in connection with tho amendment of thePent Restriction Ac to(3) That owing to the congestIon of businessthe Trade Monopolies Bill should notbe introduced this Soso ion but thePresident of the Board of Trade, v/henamending the Profiteering Act; should announce the Government1 a intention ofdealing as soon as possible vrith Ho nop -olics and in his statement the president should foreshadow legislation on thelines of tho Draft Eill and might differ-entiato between vertical and lateralcombinations in their effect on thecor vmunity *(d) The poo .responsibility of strengthening the amending Bill by including clauses dealingwith profiteering in the ede of housesend let! ir.g of furnished houses andlodgingso

(C,P.1019).It was pointed out tin t the United States C-overn-mont had a large number of submarines under constructionat  the ;, resent time.The CwOinet decided to authorise the sale of twosubmarines to the Greek Government subject to thefirst lord ox  the Admiralty being; satisfied that thesale involved no breach oi the Treaty of Peace,

TRAVELLING CONCESSIONS FOR RELATIVES VISITING GRAVES IN FRANCE &amp; BELGIUM.

(5)(a)With reference to Conclusion 8 of Conference of Ministers held on February 6th 1920, the Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretary of State for War dealing with the financial consequences and serious administrative difficulties which would follow any considerable grant of travelling concessions for relatives to visit graves in France and Belgium. (C.P.1070).

It was suggested in the course of the discussion that it might be possible for the Government to come to some arrangement with various private travel agencies.

The Secretary of State for War undertook to explore the matter further in the light of the discussion and report later to the Cabinet.                                                       LIMITATION OF PERSONAL MEMORIALS.

(b) The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the opposition which was being encountered to the policy of limiting personal memorials on the battle fields. The whole matter had been very carefully considered by an influential committee and the recommendation

in favour of the principle of equality and symmetry was supported, by the Federation of Discharged Soldiers and Sailors, by the Labour Party, and by many Service Members of Parliament.

The Cabinet endorsed the police of the Secretary of State for War in this matter.


Whitehall Gardens,  o.-...April 20th 1G20:I. &quot;iMkMT (6)    &apos;..ith reference to Cabinet 15 (BO) Minute 7,  theCabinet were informed, as a matter ox urgency,  that anattempt i/as being m. do in Commit too to extend Uneinploy-ment Insurance to persons over the age of 70.      Shesupporters oi this amendment had gathered considerableevidence in regard to men who had contributed insurancepremiums lor a number oi years, who were continuing towork after the age of 70, and who round their light to unemployment benefit taken away.      It was argued againstthe proposed amendment; that if it were extended to HealthInsurance it would have the most serious financialexxects on the Health Insurance fund.      There would bea great increase in chronic invalidity and there would &apos;have to be larger contributions from the insured andfrom the Treasury.      Tho idea had been that these cases would normally be met by Old age Densione.      Tho persons affected wore relatively small in number..,and it was worth while considering &quot;whether their cases could not bemot by allowing them some surrender value at age 70 in proportion to their &quot; aymenis up to that ago.Tho Cabinet v/ere generally agreed that a distinct-ion could be established and maintained betweenUnemployment Insurance and Health Insurance inthese cases but postponed a decision on the matteruntil the Minister oi labour could bo present.
