Paris on January 11, 1920, the Lord Chancellor statedthat further applications were being made for Judges to preside over various Commissions, and these could not bemet without the additional Judges for whom he had asked inhis Memorandum (Paper CP.-52).   He pressed that thisquestion might be considered at an early date.    In replyto an enquiry, vie stated that legislation was not involved by his proposals, which could be carried out by resolution.
IIm.m (2) With referent&apos;^^Va&amp;Ln&amp;t-Zl (20), Conclusion 2,rengthon-     the Prime&apos;Minister stated that on the. previous evening he^ the rixe representative. had had a talk with General Tudor, who had recently beensent to Ireland,    As a result, he had come to the ccnclu-sion that it would be advantageous to make some public statement to show that&quot;ihe Government, were strengthening theAdministration.,Attention was drawn to the following Question to benut the same afte&quot;noon by Mr Donald:-&quot;To ask the Prime Minister whether hewill state if it is the intention ofthe Government to take steps to bring to justice all persons who are asso-ciated with crime in Ireland;    andwhether all measures necessary willbe taken to ensure the prosecutionand punishment of persons accused of having committed an act in violation of the law&quot;,It was suggested that this would provide a suitable oppor-tunity for discussion,There was general agreement that in any statement,details,  or anything which could be used for elicitingdetails, should be avoided,  particularly in regard to the intended re-organisation of tnl/u^yil Service, the charac-te&quot; of which had not yet been considered by the Cabinet.The Cabinet agreed  That Mr Philip Kerr, in consultationwith the Chief Secretary for Ireland,should draft for the consideration ofthe Prime Minister a reply indicatingin general terms that, in order to combat the campaign of assassination,the Government are taking steps forre-organising the Executive,  reinforc-ing the Police, and increasing themilitary garrison, and that it willprobably be necessary for the Gevern-ment tp ask Parliament to strengthen the law.
CON- (3) With retosfflo-fr-to^appendix I (1 W-the-Chanoellop oftJ^^P xrJae^lu*^nr^ported that he had beer, detained by the Belgian,stione. Ambassador, who was pressing him to see the Belgian Minister ofCommerce, who had already endeavoured to see the Prime minister after the Hythe (Lyrapne) meeting, and wished to discuss questions relating to reparation and the forthcoming meeting at Spa.The Prime Minister stated that he had received a tele-gram from M. Millerand indicating that he was favourable to a postponement of the Spa Conference until July 5th;    that he pro-posed a weeting of the Allied Powers concerned at Brussels twoor three days before;    and that he wished to have a private con-versation with the Prime Minister about June 21st.    He invited the views of the Cabinet on the matter.In view of the meeting proposed for Brussels, theChancellor of the Exchequer sent word to postpone the proposed meeting with the Belgian Minister of Commerce.The Cabinet left the remaining questions relating tothe Spa Meeting to be settled by the Prime Minister in oonsulta-*tion with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, but thefollowing was the trend of the viewg expressed at this shortdiacussion&apos;,-(a) No objection was raised to the postponement of the Meeting at Spa, nor to the Inter-AlliedMeeting to precede it at Brussels.(c) It was realised that tho Italian Governmentwere inclined to be auspicious of privatediscussions between the British and french governments, but it would be difficult, inthe present state of public opinion in France,t* refuse.   The best plan would be to give theItalians an opportunity to bo present.(c) If the Chancellor of the Exchequer, owing tothe fact that he would be conducting theFinance Bill through Parliament, was unableto be present at the meeting between theprime Minister and M. Millerand when repara-tions would bo the principal subject of dia-ousoion, he should be represented by Sir john bradbury and Mr BlacScett, of tho Treasury,(d) It might be more convenient to hold themeeting at Boulogne than at Parla.
FISHING, ^4J mtJa-^f^Tice. to War Cabinet 577,^oftcdoa^n-^^Cabinet had before them ^..Jte-zicr?aixdxiirrhy&quot;the Secretary forScotland (Pane- CP.-1397)  dealing with a proposal to guar-antee the purchase of pickled herrings cured during the forth-coming summer fishery in Scotland and the autumn fishery inEngland.    It was proposed that the Government should guarantee to purchase up to a maximum of 1,000,000 barrels  for theScottish summer fishery at the price of 60/- a barrel, and upto a slmila- maximum for the English autumn fishery at a priceof 70/- a barrel   thus incurring a maximum liability ofabout  7,300,000.It was explained to the Cabinet that a similar&apos;guarantee in the form of a loan and not as a subsidy, had been grantedlast year, and that if certain German bills matured there wouldbe a considerable profit on the transaction.    The grounds forinterfering last year had been that the export trading facili-ties to Germany were exceedingly bad and the rate of exchangevery high and uncertain.    It had then been anticipated that,in the course of the ensuing twelve months, the  situation .would have improved, but in fact it had become materiallywo^ee, and similar measures to those adopted last year were again necessary if the industry were to be saved from disaster.The collapse of so important an industry would involve, direet-ly and indirectly,  some 300,050 persons, a large number ofwhom had rendered the State most arduous and devoted service on the seas during the five years of the War.    To fail to cometo the help of these loyal fisherman in the present crisiswould cause much unemployment and engender a very bitterspirit.    Other countries&apos;who were our active competitors  Norway, Holland and Denmark - were recognising the abnormalconditions of the Central European market, and were affordingfinancial help.On the other hand, the Cabinet were reminded that, onthe occasion of the announcement of the guarantee last year,
11 &apos;w^b^^^ AfSrirenew their assistance and that the-J^dx^ry..ja^-&apos;ta^^e^3to adjust itself to the-^2*e^radJLirig--oonditiona in order tobecome self-supporting.    The maximum prices now put forwardwere substantially higher than those agreed to last year,which were:-   56s.6d. per barrel for 400,000 barrels in thecase of Scotland,  and 56s.6d. per barrel for 600,000 barrelsin the ease of England.With reference to the alleged profit which the Govern-ment had made upon last year&apos;s guarantee, it was observedthat the realisation of this profit depended pn German credit,and that in any case we had to lie out of the money for twoyears.    There was little likelihood of commercial conditionsbecoming normal in the course of the next twelve months,and the result would be a fresh demand next year for a simi-lar guarantee, and a postponement of the re-establishment ofthe industry on sound conditions.Lastly,  it was impossible for the Government to haveresa^d solely to this demand.    The Treasury had to considerit in relation to all the otho&quot;1 pressing demands  for -money which were being advanced by the different Departments,  andthere were signs of widespread dissatisfaction with thetendency to use the monies obtained to reduce the debt for fresh Departmental expenditure.In reply to a suggestion that the herrings might be exported to Austria, czecho-Slovakia, the Argentine and othermarkets, it was stated that it had been found impossible to-Stimulate any large demand in those quarters, and that 80per cent, of the pre-war export trade in these herrings was done with Germany and Russia.    It was also pointed out thatthe sum that had been allotted by the Government to help tofeed Central Europe was already practically exhausted, andthat the relief schemes did not apply to Germany and russia.After seme further discussion, the Cabinet agreed  Tc reject the propea$la for a guarantee and toask the Secretary for Scotland and the Presi-dent of the Board of Trade to consider the-6-
 possibility of applying the export trading credit scheme to the export of pickled herrings.

(5) With reference to Cabinet 30 (20); Conclusion 3 (e), the Cabinet further discussed the question of the garrison of Batum. They had before them a telegram from General Milne to the War Office, dated May 30, 1920 (Paper C.P.-1378), and they were informed that the War Office, in consequence of the shipping difficulties referred to in that telegram, after consultation with the Prime Minister, had sent a telegram to General Milne instructing him to give warning of the evacuation, to collect shipping, to make arrangements for the complete withdrawal of the Allied forces at the earliest possible date, and to cable the date when the operation could commence, but not to begin the actual embarkation until further orders.

Objection was taken to the despatch of the foregoing telegram without Cabinet discussion, and attention was called to the divergent policies which were being pursued in the matter by the Foreign Office and the War Office respectively. It was contended, on the one hand, that the telegram sent by the Secretary of State for War, while, perhaps, modifying the previous decision of the Cabinet, did not in fact authorise embarkation to take place. It was urged, on the other hand, that there were no signs of impending disaster to Batum, and that if the negotiations with M. Krassin developed favourably it might be possible, within a very short time, to secure the recognition by the Soviet Government of the independence of the Caucasus, and to hand over Batum to Georgia. In the meantime, our representative at Tiflis was beseeching His Majesty&apos;s Government to help Armenia and Georgia with arms.

In the course of the foregoing discussion on Batum, reference was made to the Anglo-Persian Agreement and to the popular dissatisfaction, which was growing, with our expenditure in that region and on small military adventures in various centres in the Caucasus, at a time when economy was urgently necessary and when we were very much in need of troops for Ireland.

Owing to the lateness of the hour (2-15 a.m.) the discussion was Honoured?.


of the Committee on Future Transport Policy, dated February 14and Kay 5, 1920, together with Memoranda by the Minister ofTransport dated February 9 and May 1,  1920, with a coveringNote by the Secretary, Cabinet (Paper C.P.-1264).The Cabinet were informed that the subject of FutureTransport policy had been carefully considered by a Committeeof Ministers set up in February last by the Prime Minister,&apos;and that they had given their approval in principle to theproposals of the Minister of Transport as regards railways,and recommended that he should be authorised to open negotia-tions with the Companies on the basis of these proposals.In the course of a summary of the proposals which wasthen submitted to the Cabinet, it was pointed out that three courses were open to the Government:-(i) To nationalise the railways in the sense oftalcing over both the ownership and the oper-ation of the railways:(ii) To allow tho railways to go back to their pre-war position as competing bodies, and give them increased charging powers:(iii) To take a middle course and, while- continuingprivate ownership, to insist on an amalgama-tion of groups of railways,  for the sake ofeconomical operation, and to couple with this a measure of direct and indirect State super-vision.The policy now recommended was the third, and its justifica-tion was to be found in the history of the railways of thiscountry.   They had grown up in an unsystematic and parochialfashion, with the result that they were now very expensiveand wasteful.A number of comparative figures were laid before theCabinet, showing that the efficiency of our railway system was inferior in many respects to that of other countries whosecommercial and industrial development had been more or lessparallel with our own.   The nation could not afford toperpetuate this inferior system, and it was therefo-e neces-*sary, while retaining, the advantages of private ownership
and. permitting competition between the areas served bygroups, to frame a policy which would enable a graduallevelling up process to take place,It was proposed to group the railways into five or six large geographical areas, giving time for these combine-tions to be formed voluntarily, but taking powers to securecombination compulsorily.    The District Boards of Managementwould bo composed of si members, :13 .of.whom would representthe shareholders&apos;, and 1 of whom would be Chairman;    3 admin-is t rat ive officers, and 6 workmen elected by the workmen from among those employed by the railways of the group. This wouldgive the operating and administrative staffs a definiteinterest in the direction of the Company, and would exclude from membership of the Board of Management trade union officials from the headquarters of tho Union.    In order torequire the railway groups to conform to high standards of management, and to protect the public, certain powers would need to be vested in the Minister of Transport;    but beforeexercising some of these powers he would-be required to con-suit a Railway Advisory Committee, composed partly of tech-nical experts of the Ministry, partly of outsiders, and partly of technical railway officers.    The basis of the financialadministration of the groups would be the fixation of ratesat a level which would give the amalgamated Comcaries a pre-war standard of revenue, provided they were efficiently man-aged.   Any surplus above this &quot;living wage&quot; to or pi tel.it was proposed to share between the Government and the group,  ona sliding scale basis.   Amounts for each group would be fixedapproximating roughly to 1 per cent on ordinary.capital:the first of these amounts surplus to standard revenue to be divided, one-third to the State and two-thirds to theCompanies;   the second, fifty per cent to the State and fifty per cent to the Companies;   and the third, two-thirdsto the State and one-third to tho Companies.   The state&apos;s-9-
Rail-share Of the surplus profit should be funded for the develop-merit of light railways end of backward districts from aTransportation point of view, and an undertaking should begiven that, while the railways would not draw on the Treasury,the Treasury similarly would net draw on this development fund for general purposes.    The precise character of therate-fixing machinery was now the subject- of examination bythe Statutory    Pates Advisory Committee, who would shortlysubmit an Interim Report.   The provisions for dealing withwages were intended to remove the Government and the MinistryOf Transport, as far as possible,  from direct participation in wage disputes;    and, as a result of the negotiationsfollowing the last strike, there were already in operationa Central Wages Board, consisting of masters and men in equal numbers, and a National Wages Board, which was composed, inaddition, of representatives of the users of railways, togetherwith an Independent Chairman,In developing a policy for light railways, if was important to remove the temptation to the heavy gauge railwaysto starve out, and cripple the light railways in order to take them over.    Instead, every inducement should be offered todevelop light railways in the interests of agriculture, andother industries, which could be done by lowering the presentunduly high standards of construction and safety.    It was recommended that, where necessary, light railways should be financed out of the above--mentioned development fund.It was proposed to Pmve the docks for the presentundisturbed, but to continue the temporary powers conferred upon the Minister of Transport by the Transport Act, 1919,&apos;   in connection with non-railway-owned docks, and to take slat-lar, but less stringent, powers over railway-owned docks.
The position of the canals of the country was very unsatisfactory, and a Committee was being appointed, toexamine the whole position, under the Chairmanship of MrNeville Chamberlain*After some discussion of the proposals outlined above,the - Cabinet&apos;agreed(a) To give their general approval&quot; to theproposals?-, and. to authorise&apos; the Ministerof Transport, to announce them to theHouse of Commons at an early date;   andto enter into negotiations with the inter-ests concerned;(b) To request the Minister of Transport to embody the proposals dealing with rail-ways&apos; in a Draft Bill for submission tothe Cabinet in due course.The foregoing approval was givensubject to the understanding that therailway policy would be governed bythe principle that the railways wereto be neither a burden nor a source of profit to the States, and that pro-vision should be made to obtain fromthe railway revenue a definite sumannually towards the cost of the Min-istry of Transport (other than the salary of the Minister), such sum tobe fixed in consultation with theTreasury.-11-

.p^i (I)        The Conference was informed  that Signor Nitti had made a request for a ppstponemerrt ol   the forthcoming Con-ference at  pa until July 15th.    This request was based onthe ground of the Parliamentary difficulties which SignorNitti was  experiencing.    A similar request had also beenmade to M. Millerarid, who was, however, opposed to anypostponement,  his opposition being attributable, no doubt,to the criticism which would arise in Prance if the SpaConference were postponed.The opinion was expressed that representation of boththe French ana the Italians at the Spa- Conference was essen-tial.    So far,  Signor Nitti had played &apos;? very useful part and had placed this country in the position of being amoderator between two extreme views represented by theItalians,  on the one hand,  and the French on the other.If  the Conference were hold without  the Italians, we shouldface France alone,  and any difference of opinion with the-French would be accentuated.    It was essential,  therefore,that Signor Nitti should be present at Spa.    On the other side,  it must be remembered that since the San Remo Con-ference M. Millerand had behaved very well and had loyallygiven&apos;his support to the carrying out of the decisions ofthat Conference,    It would,  therefore, be difficult topress PI. Miller arid, in spite of his objections,  to yield to signor. Nitti1s request for a postponement.The Conference accordingly agreed  (a)    That the  Secretary of State for Forej gnAffairs should communicate with the french ambassador and request&apos; him to inform hisGovernment that the&apos; views of His Majesty&apos;s.      - Government were as follows &apos;:-(i) That Mis Majesty&apos;s Government entirelyagreed that 11 was most undeslrable to postpone the Spa Conference:(ii)  That His Majesty&apos;s Government were,however, of opinion that Signor Nitti&apos; s-p-
presence at the Conference was indis-pensable: and(iii) That His Majesty&apos;s Government were putting pressure on Signer Mittito be present at the Conference atSpa, which should be held on the date at. present f i. ed for it,, viz . , June21st- next.    His Majesty&apos;s Government- would -suggest that It. ill lief and shouldalso put pressure on Signer Mitti.(b)     That a. personal telegram to Signor IPittishould be despatched by the&apos;Prime Minister,stating that M. Millerand was understood to bevery opposed to any postponement of the SpaC o i if er e no e , f o i * p oiiticnl r e a s one, a ndthat, in view of the loyalty which M. Mille-rand had. displayed in supporting the deci-sions of the San Remo Conference, it wouldbe very difficult for His Ma. j e s ty 1 s Govern-ment to press him to agree to a postponement of the Spa Conference.-    The telegram shouldalso make a strong appeal to Signer Pittito be present at the Spa Conference on thedate at present arranged,  viz., June 21st, next(2)        With reference to Cabinet 30 (20),  Conclusion 3,and to the decision that the War Office should carry outthe military dispositions they proposed for a concentrationat Kasvin of the military forces in North Persia,  theConference were informed that the question had been raised whether, if the EolsLeviks evacuated Enzeli,  the british forces should re-occupy that place.The Conference agreed --That it would not be ir/accordance withthe decision of the Cabinet (Cabinet 30(20),  Conclusion 3)  taken on May 21st,for British forces to re-occupy Enzeliin the event of evacuation by theEols!: eviks .
3a   (i ) The GOniorenco woro informed...that M.Erassin,.member of the Soviet Executive, had arrived in this country in order* to conduct negotiations regarding there opening of trade with Russia.   M*Krassin had stipulated-latod that ho should soo the Prime Minister and theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, tut the question,,arose as to who should he nominated to conduct the de-tailed negotiations with M. Erase in,The Conference agreed --That the detailed negotiations regarding theroopening1 of trade with Russia should be conducted on behalf of His Majesty1s Govern-ment by the following the President of the Board of Trade,Sir Laming Y/or thing ton Evans, andHepr.ecsiitatives of the Treasury andThe Mima.a try of Pood.(ii ) The Conference had before thorn the following Papersregarding the Russian situation and the proposed neg-negotiations with Mo Eras sin:-A Note by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs   (Paper CP.-1350):A Note summarising the Conclusions of theIntel-Departmental Russian Trade Committeeon the.Chief Obstacles to the Resumption ofTrade with Russia (Paper CP.-1349):A Rote cm tie Board of Trade  (Paper CP.-1342 ):A Men era mama from the Political IntelligenceDepartment s Foreign Office, entitled &quot;RecentTendencies in Soviet RussIa&apos;T  (paper CP,-1326).The attention of the Conference was particularlydrawn to the Rote by Lord Curzon (Paper C?3-1350),suggesting that the opportunity of M. Erassinrs visitshould be seized In order to come to an understandingconcerning the many points on which the British Govern-ment were at issue with the Soviet Government in diff-different parts of Europe and the East,    These points mere,in particular,  the question of British prisoners andBritish subjects who had been detained in Russia;    thequestion of Bolshevist interference In Afghanistan, in persia and the Caucasus; and, finally, the question.3.., of/
 of General Wrangel&apos;s force in the Crimea.

It was suggested that any agreement in regard to trade would be impossible unless a general agreement on the political questions at issue with the Soviet Government were arrived at. It was most desirable that a comprehensive arrangement should be reached. The Conference was asked to remember that the present political situation gave His Majesty&apos;s s Government an opportunity for driving a good bargain. In Poland, while there were indications that the moment the Bolsheviks were enjoying some success against the Polish armies and that tho Poles would unable to maintain hostilities later then July,  the Polish Army was a strong military force.  In the Crimea, General Wrangel had succeeded in re-organising his Army and instilling discipline into it. He had also conciliated the other political parties opposed to the Bolsheviks, and his force was one which now had to be reckoned with. It seemed very likely that he would be able to hold the Crimea against all attacks.      In the Ukraine there was strong anti-Bolshevik feeling, and the peasantry were well-armed and capable of offering a strong resistance to the Bolsheviks. All these facts must be borne in mind in negotiating with M. Krassin. It was accordingly suggested that the British Government should offer to the Soviet Government their whole-hearted co-operation in concerting a Peace between the Soviet Government, on the one hand,  and General Wrangel and the Polish Government on the other. The agreement in regard to General Wrangel should provide that the Crimea should form an asylum for the remnants of the classes opposed to the Bolsheviks, and that immunity from Bolshevist advances should be granted to the Crimea for at least a year. If such an arrangement was come to it was thought that the situation in Russia would be greatly improved and would permit of the Russian refugees now in the Crimea returning under amnesty to Russia. In return, the British Government should insist on a comprehensive agreement which/
which should cover the various points at issue between the Soviet Government and this country, namely, the return of prisoners from Russia, and Bolshevist interference in Afghanistan, Persia and the Caucasus. The agreement should also covert Bolshevist propaganda in the United Kingdom, Allied countries and Central Europe. If either the Polish Government or General Wrangel refused to accept the intervention of the British Government, the only course open to us would be to leave them to their fate.

The suggestion was also made to the Conference that it would desirable to obtain guarantees from the Soviet Government as to the action of the Bolshevik Fleet in the Baltic.

The Conference accordingly agreed --

(a) That before opening negotiations in regard to trade with Russia, the British Government should insist on the negotiation of a comprehensive political agreement with the Soviet Government, on the lines suggested in the Memorandum dated May 27, by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Paper C.P.-1360):

(b) That the Admiralty and the War Office should prepare, for circulation to the Cabinet, a statement of the particular points on which they wished a settlement to be reached with the Soviet Government, such as, for instance, the Naval situation in the Baltic.

(iii) Representation of Allied Countries at meetings with M. Krassin

(iii) The conference next considered the representation of Allied Governments at the meetings with H. Krassin.

It was pointed out that the Supreme Council had approved a telegram to M. Krassin on April 26, 1920 (I.C.P.-109, Appendix I), which stated that the Supreme Council had decided to authorise representatives of the Allied Governments to meet M. Krassin and the Russian Trade Delegation with a view to the immediate re-starting of trade relations between Russia and other countries through the intermediary of the 






Co-operative organisations, and otherwise.      The telegramalso stated that the Allied representatives would be pre-pared to discuss with the Russian delegates the best methodof removing the obstacles and difficulties in the way of the resumption of peaceful brad&quot;  relations with a desire of fin..&amp;-ing solutions in the general interests of   Europe.This telegram clearly made it essential that theFrench and Italian Governments should be represented at thenegotiations with Id. Krssslr., and In any case the presenceof representatives of the billed Governments was desirable in order to preclude any appearance of separate negotiationon the part of Pis Male Sty 3 Government.      This was partl-cularly necessary in view of the fact that, in accordancewith the immediately preceding Minute,  it was how proposednot merely to negotiate on the subject of reopening trade -relations with Russia, but to attempt to reach a comprehensivepolitical agreement with the Soviet Government,The Conference accordingly agreed -**That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should communicate at once withthe French Ambassador, and inform him ofthe policy which His Majesty5s government now proposed bo adopt in the negotiationswith M. Krassin.     A copy of the telegram sent to M. Krassin on the approval of theSupreme Council &apos;1.1 .P.-109,* Appendix I)should be communicated to M. Cambon, andhe should be invitee to attend the firstmeeting with M. Krassin.     If M. Caytbonrefused to do so without authority fromhis Government, the question could be con-side red whether the Italian Charge afAffairesshould be approached. The Japanese Governmentshould, also be given an opportunity of beingrepresented,-onduct of (Iv) The Conference were informed that, although one of the:&apos; Eras sin&apos;solleaguea   conditions on which I, Eras sin and his party were admitted into this country was that they should not indulge in propaganda, M.Klishko was already making arrangements tosecure the admission into Russia of certain British ex-tr.emls.ts..     das this action sufficient to warrant repre-sentationebeing made to M.

Klishkedid not afford sufficient ground for waiting anywritten comrmnicalion to       Krassin, but the PrimeMinister should use his discretion to raise itat his forthcoming anterview,.fOLXCT (4) On the assurrptdnn that it was desirable to resume$russia...-treadlejrofLations-frith Russia, the Conference proceeded tosohange3r -old--consider the question whether it would not be better tonegotiate on the basis of payment by Russia in raw materialsrather than in gold.It was agreed that it was important that we should get into as close touch as possible with the peasants andothers who were actually producing in Russia, and that itwould be better from a political point of view to receivepayment In materials rather than gold.It was pointed out that the answer to this questiondepended (1&apos;  on whether raw materials existed In Russia toany substantial extent, are ( -) if they existed, whether theycould be got out: and it was felt that If our aim was toencctirage the actual Russian producer, better headway wouldbo made if we proceeded in the initial stages to exchangeBritish goods for gold in the hands of the Bolshevist government-ment) and thereby stimulating the improvement of transport facilities.      It would-be impossible for1 raw materials to bepot out of Russia until much greater transport facilities were available than was are case at.present.      By exchangingrailway material (locomotives and. wagons)  for gold, a startwould, be made which might result in the Russians being ableto export raw materials.      It is as, however, generally agreedthat an operation which wont no further than the exchange ofrailway material for gold would serve no useful purpose,   .l&apos;hts A discussion then took place as to tho possible rights&apos;f BritishEditorso-of British creditors of the former Russian Government to attach any gold which might be sent to this country in
payment    for goods to be no&quot;r supwlied to the Bolshevist&apos;Government, and it mas stated that the representatives of the [fermcr Russian Government  contended that the bar gold now inthe possession of the Bolshevist Government was identifiable,and that accordingly it would bs- open to the successors of title of the old Government or the creditors thereof to attach the gold on its arrival here,It was generally agreed that the legal position inregard to this natter mc obscure,  and that while it might be open to the actual owner of identifiable gold to recoversuch gold, the seme considcrat ion&apos; did net at all apaly to aor edit or of that  owner, who wmuld merely have a right tosue for a debt ,      If. however-,, gold payments were made by theCo-operative See levies ,   acting-.on behalf of the &quot;Russian Govern- &apos;mont , those Societies could be regarded as being in theposition to give a title to the gold.In answer to an enquiry by the Prime Finist or, Mr.Wise stated that the  commodities which Russia had to exportwere flax,  timber,  grain and platinum.      It was improbable that&apos; any of the exportable  commodities would, form a part ofthe previous purchases of the British Government.      It was estimated that there were about 20,000 tons of ilax available,but this was thought an excessive fiaure by th &apos;- Board ofTrade..     It  should bo possiblr to  &quot;ret a substantial quantityof grain out of the Kuban and. the Caucasus.,  bartering it for&apos;agricultural machinery,- tools,  clothing, huota,  etc., all ofwhich were urgently needed by the peasants.-    The - negotiations might, proceed on the lines of those adopted last year, when&apos;commodities wore exported from Great Britain to the Sea ofAzov and there bartered for grain,  &quot;to.     la. Krassin was willing to allow the export  of grain provided that he  couldfirst feed the inhabitants of the towns. m.
The Conference thought it would be. desirable, ifpossible, to rot from M, Krassin some general und^irtakdngcn the subject of the Russian pre-Revolution debt.      It might--.,be possible to get the Bolshevist Government to recognisethat  debt ,   even if they were not prepared, at this stage todiscuss proposals for liquidating it.      This would apply tosums borrowed By former Russian Governments frow. the Allies,etc.,  as well as debts c&quot;ing to private individuals.It  &quot;ras pointed cut  that,   in any negotiations,  carewould have to be taken not tc emphasize the benefits accruing to British trade,        It might be said that,  in promoting t:.-exchange of railway material for raw materials and gold, th^British Government were actuated by purely selfish interests.It was pointed out . however,  that  it, would be quite open tothe French or Italian Govemments to say what  commoditiesthey could supply in exchange for Russian mat-rials.Some doubts were expressed as to the possibility ofthe Ministry of Munitions being in a position to supplylocomotives at the present time,  but it was understood thata substantial  number cf railway wagons w&amp;:g    available forexpert to Russia,Ultimately it was decided:-That a Committee,  consisting of -Sir Laming Worthington Bvans ( Chairman)Sir H.

POOD^iSOKERS        (1)    With reference to Cabinet SO (00), Conclusion 4,the Conference had. under consideration the position of theIrish prisoners who had been released from Wormwood Scrubs.It was stated that at the present moment 13 prisoners wore&apos;in custody, 225 had been removed to hospital, 3 were onparole, and 77 were at large in London,     The question arose as to whether those men were to be re-arrested orwhether they should be forcibly detained in this country.It w as pointed out that the Government was hardlyin a position to come to  a decision on this question until they were aware of the policy of the Irish Executive, bothin regard to this and other matters,   and that it, would be advisable to postpone a decision until the Irish sovorn-ment had placed their views before the Cabinet,The Conference decided -That the Viceroy, the Chief Secretary andthe C oinmander - in- Chi e f of the Forces inIreland should be invited to attend a meetingof the Cabinet on the following Monday.Tho Attorney-General for Ireland, undertook to communicate this decision to Sir hamar greenwood, Sir Nevil Hacready, and theSecretary to Field Marshal Lord French.ICE OF (2)    The Conference had before them a Memorandum by theCO/- ST-&apos; STATIONS* Admiralty (Paper C.P0-1353) in which it was stated that theCommander-in-Chief Lrestem Approaches had represented thatarmed revolutionaries wore attacking and burning CoastguardStations i and that Sir Nevil Macroady had stated that thecivil and military authorities were incapable of protectingthese Stationse     The Admiralty  agreed that, in the cir-ovunstancos, a force of 800 Royal Marines should be utilised for this purposes the Conference decided -(a) That the First Sea Lord should give instructions for 80A Royal Marine8 to be despatched toIreland for the purpose of protecting theCoastguard Stations:(b) That the Royal Marines should, ho under thoorders of the Commander-in-Chief MilitaryForces in Ireland.

He did not *british the time of theCabinet to be taken up with these matters, and therefore suggested tnat the questions, which were not of first-class importance,  should be referred to a small Committee for decision.The Conference agreedThat the Lord President of the- council should refer ouestions relating to theLeague of Nations, which required adecision,  t    a Committee consisting- of --The Lord President of the Council  (Chairman),The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, :MThe  President of the Board of Education,Lieut.--Col.

With, reference to Cor.clup.ion 1 of a Corfereneeof Ministers held or Key 28th, ao 4.-30 p. it, , the 0.h:;efSecretary for I t-b iar.nl was requested to make a yteb sment tothe Conference outlining the position of affairs in Ire]sad    Iand the policy which the Irish Executive proposed to adopt.The Chief Secretary, in the course of his   t a r-ement,said that he considered that the most insertant task of theIrish Executive was to stamp out the campaign of murder andarson which prevailed more particularly in Dublin and in the counties of Limerick, Cork and Kerry.    All their etherdifficulties wexe subsidiary to this.     After giving detailsregarding the methods employed by the organisers of theseoutrages, the Chief Secretary passed on to the means by whichthen should he combated.    He expressed himself against theintroduction of martial law at the present moment, but would prefer to await the result of the new method oi putting downoutrages by the use of mobile troops.    He had great confidence in this plan, which had been suggested by Sir Nevil Macreadyand which was beinp developed energetically by him.Some discussion then followed regarding the effeotive-ness of introducing martial law, but doubt was expressed atothe desirability of placing supreme power in the hands of aCourt Martial.Attention was then drawn to the assistance whichwould ve rendered to the I rise Executive in dealing- withtheir difficulties if only moderate public opinion in Irelanddefinitely &apos; .were pen their side , It was suggested that the best means of ensuring this lay in some plan whereby Irishmen were made bofeel the effect of the campaign of murder and arson alongeconomic channels,    it would, no doubt, be impossible to do this by means of increasing- the local taxation, but it mightbe possible to increase the pecuniary burdens of the irish people by intercepting for the payment of compersatlon? etc.,Treasury&apos;to the equivalent and other grants in aid due from the/Irxsh Local
Authorities.    Mention was made of the fact that theExecutive already had a Bill drafted which.carried out thissuggestion, and it was generally agreed that such a Eillshould he introduced in Parliament without dslapiReference was ail so made to the effect which would becr^at^d vv a c .rrt ailment of the every-da v facilities of any area which was disaffected:, 3. a , postal and railway facilitactogether, perhaps, with an einnarsro on the marketable productsoi suCii an axe a.It was generally agreed that the introduction of martial law at this moment was undesirable, but that it mightbe possible to obtain all the advantages and none of the dis-advantages of such a course by reviving some of the powers given by Acts of Parliament (e. g. , the Spencer and HarcourtActs) which had been passed to deal with difficulties somewhat similar to those which existed at the present time.The Conference decided  That the Irish Executive, after eonsuita-tion with the Lord Chancellor and the attorney-General for Great Britain, should consider and make recommendations to theCabinet as to  (a) Lapsed powers contained in Acts ofParliament which might be revived atthe present time by&quot;the Irish Executive:(b) The best method of imposing fines and penalties on Irishmen in an affectedarea:Cc) The best method of interfering with theeverV-day facilities of an affected area.iATTOP The Conference further decided  a SPECIALCg.

rOL CF       (1) With reference to Cabinet 25 (90), Conclusion 1, thetl&quot; and prices   Conference had before there a Memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (Paper CP.-1336) proposing that thecontrol of the wholesale price and the  retail price of coal should be abolished, with the object of. making the consumerpay a proper economic price for coal,  and of allowing dis-t-ibutien to flow back,  as far as possible,  into its pre-war channels,It was explained to the Conference that the initiative of the coal trade had been very largely destroyed by thecontrol imposed during the &quot;Jar.    Neither coal-owners, mer- .chants hod retailers were interested in the quality of thecoal produced,  and laid the blame for the inferior qualityon the Coal Cont^olleT1.    The proposal to de-control wholesaleand retail prices flowed naturally, from the decision whichhad already been taken by the cabinet.net to de-control distribu-tion.    If this proposal were adopted, there would only remain the control over pr.pu.ris and the control over the pit*a mouthprice.    The regulation of home prices would then be left(apa^t f:nom the control over the pit&apos;a mouth price) to theoperation of the Profiteering Act.    The standard of profitallowed under the Acts which at present affected the coal trade would give an adequate guide to Profiteering .Co;nmit- - .tees, while many merchants.would be in a position to supply at a lo^-er p**ice than those Acts allowed.    It was true that,owina- to the shortage of coal, it. might be feared thatcertain purchasers, for instance, prosesrpus manufacturers,-,would offer a premium for coal if the present. control-..over .- -.-prices were relaxed, but- it was confidently expected, that - vthe coal trade themselves would co-operate to prevent -any,   .,such action.   At the present time the atmosphere in the coalt-ade was one of co-operation with the government.    For thefirst time since the imposition of control, both owners and merchants were working with the Government in the policy of
l-e nar-rfrly on I3ign Ide-control,    The Coal Supply Committees would., still operate,and would be able to control coal merchants whom they sup-plied.    The merchants had voluntarily undertaken to imposecontrol on their own dealings, and a recent meeting of 2,000coal merchants had given enthusiastic support to the policyof the Government.    The merchants realised that any suspicion of profiteering or of favouritism in the allocation of sup-plies would be fatal to de-control and would load to a demandfor municipal trading in coal and eventually to the extinctionof their own business.Some discussion took place as to the effect on thetrade of the country, of the continued restrictions on the-_,___________________11t-A      export of coal.    It was pointed out that in 1913 british exports amounted to 73,000,000 tons, whereas in the presentyear they were expected to amount to sorce 20,000,000 tons,of --hioh 9,000,000 would be allocated to Prance, 4,000,000to Italy, and only 7,000,000 to other countries.    The result would be that ships would leave this country empty, and imports  &apos; particularly imports of food   would have to bear the cost of a double freight.    It was therefore suggestedthat it would be better now to check the present feverishindustrial activity by relaxing the      restrictions on theexport of coal than to subsidise industry generally at theexpense of the coal trade and, incidentally, of importers inthis country.   A decrease in industrial activity was inevit-able, and the sooner it came the better.    At present wages were being forced up from day to day,  and manufacturers were willing to pay any price for labour, since they knew thatthey could well afford it.    &quot;Then business became- more slackthe country would be left with a huge liability in wages.This liability could, at any rate,  be decreased by allowing a freer export of coal.In reply, it was pointed out that the slackening ofindustrial activity had already begun.    Thile manufacturr.:.u
had sufficient orders to carry then over the next fewmonths, the business cobvaunity were agreed that the peak of industrial activity had been reached in April, and thatsuch activity was now on the downward grade.    It was not desirable to accelerate this tendency by increasing exportsof coal, particularly as it was economically more paying to export finished and semifinished goods than goods such ascoal, .which underwent no manufacturing processes.The Conference accordingly agreed -To accept the proposals set fcth in theMemorandum by the F-esilent of the Boardof Trade (Paper C.p,-vbb. , vi^i......thatthe present control of whm-e&amp;ale and retail prices of com. eh^u&apos;: d be abolished,but that the pit: s mouth price should re-nain under control.
?

(2) With reference to Cabinet 25(20), Conclusion ? of May 6th. 1920, the Conference had before them a joint memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Transport (C.P. 1362) regarding the decontrol of inland distribution of coal. The memorandum pointed out that in order to ensure supplies of coal for home requirements exports had recently been curtailed. In consequence coal from South Wales and the north-east coast of England had been diverted inland instead of being exported. The diverted coal had been taken by the Railways and it was suggested that this procedure, which would release some 60,000 tons of coal per week from midland collieries for industrial, public utility, and household purposes inland, should be continued.     This would however, throw upon the Railway Companies a heavy financial burden since they would be compelled to purchase coal at a higher price and haul it for longer distances. The Increased burden, which was estimated at  2,000000 per annum should not, it was suggested, be accepted by the Railways or transferred by them to the public, but should be not out of the pool resulting from the financial arrangements between the Coal Mines Department and the Coal Owners.

The Conference were informed that at the present time sufficient coal was not being raised inland to supply both the Railways and inland consumers. The restriction on the export of South Wales and Northumberland and Durham coal had relieved the scarcity due to the diminished output of coal as compared with the pro-war output, but this restriction in itself was not sufficient since it was necessary to control the buying operations of the Railways and inland consumers. For instance purchasers in the north of England could not be allowed to buy coal from South Wales to the north would result in hopeless confusion on the railways. It was therefore proposed to deal with the matter by making a comprehensive arrangement with the railway companies whereby these companies would purchase the coal from South Wales and Northumberland and Durham.
Attention was:drawn to the fact that, whereas therevenue on profits from the export of coal was not receiveduntil a considerable time after the exports took place, theproposed expenditure of  2,000,000 would take place atonce;    so that in effect, the Treasury would be called on to finance the present transaction for something like a year.The financial position of the coal industry was that .some 12,000,0C0 to  15,000,000 had been written off ay a aeadloss, and that some  15,000,000 would be required, to - meetthe advar.ce in wages, to the miners.    The Treasury could not,therefore,- finance the, present proposals for a year.    Theproposed expenditure of  2,000,000 was, in effect, a subsidy to manufacturers,  since the arrangement would enable manu-facturers to buy coal at a cheaper rate than would be pos--stole if the railway companies were.allowed to compete in a free market. -On the other hand, emphasis was laid on the hopelessconfusion on the railways which would result from allowingboth railway companies and other purchasers to buy coal inan unrestricted market.    The proposed subsidy of  S,000,00-0was only a necessary corollary of the restriction on theexport of coal.After some discussion as to the effect of remotingall restrictions, both.on the sale abroad and the sale inthis country 0f British coal, the Conference agreed  (a) To approve the proposals set forth in. &amp;heJoint Memorandum by the President of  taeBoard of Trade and the lianas&quot;--ea of Ermm--port  (Paper CP,--1562),  to the e  fee&apos;, hk-mthe increased cost of ensuringptrolie &apos;*supplies in the. midland area should be netout of the pool resulting from the financial arrangements between the Goal Mines Depart-ment and the coal-owners:(b) That the President of the Board of trade should use every endeavour to accelerate the payment of sums due to the Exchequerfrom the sale of export coal, in order thatthe Exchequer might, so far as possible, be relieved from the burden of financing theproposed expenditure of  2,020,000.
(3) ffith reference to Cabinet ?,9 (SO), Concluaion 7,  and cabinet 22 (SO), Conclusion 2 (at which i*. was decided thatthe subsidy to coastal shipping should terminate in the middleof May and that the Shipping Controller should call a Con-conferenee of the shipowners concerned and communicate thisdecision to them),  the Conference had before them a joint memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade and theShipping Controller (Paper CP.-1199)  reporting the result ofa Conference which they had held with the shipping ownersconcerned in the coasting trade.    The shipowners had stated,that if the coastal subsidy scheme were withdrawn withoutany steps being taken to deal with competitive railway rates,it would be impossible for shipowners to continue the presentcoastal services;    but that if the exceptional railway ratesreferred to in the report of the Ministry of Transport RatesAdvisory Committee (CM, D. 525, 1919, page 7,  (C) Rates affect-ed by competition by Water) were withdrawn, the coastingservices could be continued without the subsidy.It was explained that the coastal subsidy had been started at a time when the railways.were greatly congestedand railway rates were at pre-war figures,  in order to bring back shipping to the coasting trade and so relieve congestion,the deficit being paid by the Exchequer.    Since then,  railway rates had been put up, and the congestion also had been relieved.The Cabinet, at their meeting on April 29th, had decided that the coastal subsidy should cease, and had suggested that coastal shipowners might be reminded of thepowers of control which the Shipping Ministry still possessed.The Conference were informsd^tft^t, in view of the improved position on the railways, the Ministry of transport was new prepared to carry the traffic if the coastal ship-owners failed to do so.    There was general agreement inthe Conference that the shipping subsidy should cease.    Onbehalf of the Ministry of Shipping, however, the view was
expressed that the cessation must be accompanied by a revision of the exceptional railway rates which had been deliberately fixed before the War to compete with coastal shipping.    It was represented that otherwise the coastal shipping trade would be ruined. . On the other hand,  it was stated that the revision proposed would require a prolongedenquiry into many thousands of rates,  and could not becompleted fon some considerable time, and that the profits made in the coastal shipping trade during the last two years were such that it was not correct to state that the businesscould not be carried on without a subsidy.    It was pointedout, however, that if the    competitive railway rates wereunremunerative to the railways,.the traffic would becarried at the expense of the community, and it would be unfair to withdraw the coastal subsidy while indirectlysubsidising the railway companies in this way.

1_        (V) &apos;Th^ Oubancellor of the Bxehe^rue^-  said that,., in 2hle7PSIA. r^crerse of the condensation with V,.  Erassin at 10,  Downing.fsian Gold. Street, the previous Monday,  1/1. Kras3in had made a proposal that Russian gold should form the basis of the resumption oftrade with his country.    This proposal, however,  raisedsomewhat complicated questions, the chief difficulty in thematter lying in the fact that M. Krassin and his colleaguescould not show an absolutely secure title to this gold.Mr Chamberlain said he had accordingly circulated to hiscolleagues that afternoon a Paper prepared in the Treasury(CP.-1394 (See Appendix I)  on the subject.    The view heldby his Department was that gwdd held by the Bolsheviks couldnot be made the basis of credits in the same way as gold towhich an absolutely good, title could be shown,  and the Bankof England would almost certainly refuse to accept and pay for such gold.    It was, however, an essential part of the goldpolicy which we had adopted that all gold should,  for thepresent,,be sold to the Bank of England, and the surplus goldof the Joint Stock Banks had been handed over to the Bankin accordance vrith this policy.    Mr Chamberlain said he wishedto raise another point, which had not been touched upon inthe Treasury Paper.    There was a certain amount  ef goldbelonging to Roumania,&quot;now lying in Moscow.    When Roumaniacame into the War we guaranteed this gold to her, but when she made Peace we withdrew this guarantee, but we substitutedfor it a promise that we would use our good offices to have it returned to her in the course of time.    This suppliedanother reason why we should not touch the Russian gold.Some of the mbst important people in the City were convincedthat,if Russian gold were shipped to this country, a largenumber of claims would at once be taken to the Law Courtsby private creditors of Russia.The Opinion of the Law Officers, on the other handiSee Appendix II), which was based upon the hypothesis thatthis gold was the prope -ty of the  Russian Government, wasthat no foreign Government, past or present, is amenable toraniani.
any form of proeess in the English pour-ts, and there did notappear to he any legal method by which creditors of theformer Russian Government could either establish theohr-mil^iiaSs,or enforce them against property alleged to belong to thatGovernment.A. general discussion followed, in the course of whichthe view was expressed that a common-sense policy would- be toget some firm or firms to act on behalf of the British Govern-ment, in which case the difficulties apprehended by theTreasury -Would not arise.      It was suggested that Russian gholdshould not be shipped to England, but might be deposited witha neutral Government, and that that Government should, givetho Bank of England credit for it.      If it was deposited, say,in Copenhagen, and held  ..&apos;or the benefit of British trade withRussia, it could not he attached.    In regard to this su.ggest-ion it was pointed out that it was hardly becoming for HisMajesty^ Government to base trade transactions upon golddeposited in a neutral country.Reference was then made to a statement which had ap-appeared in several newspapers to the effect that commodities from England were not to be paid for in gold, but by barterin goods.    This statement, it ^a&amp;s explained, was almost certainly inspired from Paris.    The French clalEied preferen-tial rights in any assets which might be In the hands of theBolsheviks, and the?/ were considerably disturbed at thecourse thai&apos; understood the negotiations with M. Krassin to be%33s&amp;zig *     They did not wish themselves to have any commercewith the Bolsheviks, and at tho orcae time they resented theidea that wo should be re-starting our trade and reaping theprincipal benefits by being the first in the field.There was general agreement that it was highly import-ant to get trade with Russia re-started as soon as possibleThe Cabinet had been informed that morning by the Presidentof the Board of !f3*ade that British trade was inclined to sagand it was essential to open up new channels of business.
On the other hand,  it would be very damaging to Great Britainpolitically if she alone were to resume oommercial relationswith the Bolsheviks.    There was no doubt that Italy wasvery anxious indeed to reopen her trade with Russia.In this connection the  Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs  stated that he had sounded informally the  japanese and Italian Chargers d*Affaires on the subject of their Govern-meuts being represented in the negotiations now proceeding with M. Krassin.    Both these officials had replied that theymust refer the question to their Governments.    Lord Curzonsuggested that perhaps it wight be advisable for him to sound the American Ambassador as to the views of the WashingtonGovernment.It was explained that the &quot;Barter Association&quot; of theUnited States had been negotiating with !-!.. Krassin in respect,of railway material and rolling stock for Esthonia, for which russia had been prepared to deposit  1,000,000 in England andanother  1,000,000 in the United States.    The idea had beenthat the United States should supply the material through us.The Americans,-however, would not touch the transaction.It was agreed that trie moral advantage of the presenceof Allied representatives at the conversations with II. Krassinwould be very considerable.As regards the suggestion that trade with Russia shouldbe carried on not by the British Government but throughprivate traders,  it was stated that such traders would certain-ly not be prepared to do any business unless they were assured that the gold to pay for the commodities supplied by them would be shipped to this  country and would not be attached on arrival he re.    If an assurance could be given that the goldon reaching England could not be attached either by theBritish Government or by other British creditors, there wouldcertainly be keen competition among business men to reopentrade.    As an alternative to shipping gold to England,  itwas suggested that traders should have letters of credit on
: neutral &quot;banks in which the gold might he deposited; their interests\rould thus be safeguarded,  as those banks would make no payment untilthe goods were actually shipped.The Att orrmy-General then re-stated the view of the Law Officers,that gold which was the property of a de facto foreign Governmentwere not officially recognised.    Thf  Russian Governmentcould not be attached,   ever, if that Government/had undoubtedly requisi-tioned er acquired in some way this gold,  but even if they had not a secure title to it he did not see how litigation could be initiatedto lay hands upon it.gome doubt was expressed as to whether the Bolshevist Governmentwould be disposed to acknowledge their indebtedness to certain Britishsubjects who had invested in railway shares and various bonds issuedor guaranteed by the old Russian government or whose property had beenseized or nationalised by the Rolsheviks.    It was stated that Mr.peters,  of the Overseas Trade Department, was of opinion that M.Krassin could be induced to make some acknowledgment of this Indebted-ness,  and that it was the unanimous view of business men in the Citythat an essential preliminary to the resumption of trade was that theSoviet Government should recognise their obligations.    It was suggestedthat,  in the next conversation with M. Krassin, he should be asked toobtain from his Government some assurance in respect of this.    In thisconnection it was pointed out that it was desirable that the BritishGovernment should make it clear that we al30 recognised the obliga-tions of Russia to the French.    It was agreed that it was most unfertu-nate that there should be any difference of opinion with our Alliesrespecting the renewal of trade relations.    It was explained that theattitude of the French Government was that all that had been decided at san Remo was that trade relations should he resumed with the Soviets;out the French felt that we were going beyond this,  as our meetingsv,&apos;cessation M. Krassin were not confined tc experts but were attended bydiplomatists,  and that questions of policy,  as apart from trade, were discussed.    It was desirable to remove with the least possible delayafly source of friction.
oaaticilege s,and misunderstanding with the French, and it was suggestedthat, as it wag impossible  for the two Price Ministers tomeet and have a frank discussion, it might be advisable thatMr Lloyd George 3hould send a personal co.--munication to M.Millerand, explaining exactly our position, and once moreinviting French co-operation.    Tho object of the conversa-tions with M. Xrassin was:   to discover what impedimentsexisted in tho resumption of trade, and the best way of removing those impediments.    The difference between ourselves and the French was partly due to this,- that they envisagedcommercial obstacles only, whereas we perceived politicalobstacles.    Directly, however, the French took part in these conversations, whether by a diplomatic representative 0&quot; bypurely technical experts, they were bound to be confrontedsooner 0- later with identical  difficulties with ourselves.The French resentment at tho line we were taking was partly due to their belief that the British Ministers had met M.Krassin without waiting for the reply of the French Governmentto the communication we had made to them on the subject.This, of course, was not true.Reference was then made to the following stipulationswhich had been made by M. Krassin at the conversation on theprevious Monday;-&quot;Commercial representatives must have the right and the practical facilities freely to corarauni-cate with their own and other countries by pest,telesiranh and wireless, by means of cypher, withpreferential rights over the correspondence ofprivate persons.&quot; ...... The work of commercial .representatives absolutely required that docu-ments, passoorta, powero-of-attorney,  agreements,etc.,  signed or confirmed by the official author!-ties of one country should be recognised as legallyvalid in the other country, since no transactionsare possible w it ho wefulfilment of this con-dition.    It. was equally necessary to have theright to vindicate one&apos;s interests in the Courts.&quot;It was pointed out that M. Krassin and his colleaguescould hardly be expected to be accorded complete ambassadorialprivileges, and it was suggested that these stipulations&apos;&apos;should be carefully examined by the Foreign Office and the
Board of Trade in consultation, and that the Prime minister should he-acquaimted with their views before he next met M.,iCras-sin.Some further discussion followed,  in the course of whichit was explained that the country principally interested inthe resumption cf trade with Aussie was Great Britain,  becauseof her enormous Imperial and commercial Interests there.    Italycame next,  chiefly because of her shortage of food.    Prance,  onthe other hand, was not so closely concerned,  and the Frenchdoubted whether they stood to gain much by such resumption,  andwere inclined to think that they even stood to lose a good deal,It was generally agreed  (a) That it was highly important for the BritishEmpire that trade with Russia should be resumed withas little delay as possible:(b) That Russian gold would at the outset have to formthe basis of this trade,  and that the Board of Iradesh-nild take up this question in consultation &quot;with theTreasury,  with special reference to the questionof permitting gold to be shipped to this country:(c) That it was desirable that business should boresumed by private traders, and that the BritishGovernment should not be directly concerned in thematter;(d) That it would be preferable that Great britain should not stand alone in re-starting trade with the soviets,  and that endeavours must be made to induceour Allies to participate.    In view of this,  the secretary of state for Foreign Affairs should endeavour to secure the attendance of the italian ambassador,  or other representative of the ItalianGovernment at any rate,  and of the Japanese Ambassador,if possible, when the Conversation with M. Erassinwas resumed:(e) As regards the various stipulations submitted by M.Erassin (See Appendix to Conversation held at 10,Downing Mbreot,  on may SlstTJ^relating to&quot; commercialrepresentation and the grant of privileges and immunities to the representatives, the Board of Tradeand Foreign Office should consider jointly what reply should be made to M. Erassin7 s proposals;(f) That the next Conversation v.ith M. Erassin shouldtake place at 10.Downing street, on Monday next,June 7,  1920, at&apos; 5,30 p.m.:
(g) That afe the next rose ting with M. JCraasin the latter should be asked to ascertain whether or not theSoviet Government were prepared to recognise anyobligations on their part in respect of such foreigndebts as might have been incurred under the oldregime, and also in respect of claims arising fromnationalisation of property of foreigners under the. present regime.The Board of Trade 3hould prepare a statement whichthe Prime Minister could make .te M. JCraesin on thissubject.(h) That Mr. E.P.Wise should be responsible for collectingthe materials from the Departments concerned, for a comprehensive statement to be made by the PrimeMinister at the meeting with M. JCrassin on thefollowing Monday afternoon.jelds. It was stated that the soviet Delegation in england had raised the question of sweeping the minefields outsidePetrograd, and had enquired whether this should be done by theBritish or Russian minesweepers.It was agreed that the work,  if carried out by theEussia Soviet Government, would probably be roost inefficientlydone, and It was decided  To refer the matter to the Admiralty, who shouldbe asked to communicate their views to thePrime Minister before the meeting on Monday afternoon.
&apos;BI11*    It was explained that the, Home Affairs Committeehad decided to confine the Bill to dwelling housesfoilowing thc rocommenaation of lord Salisbury1sCommittees    It was, however, certain that-an effort would be made In tho House of Commons to extend theprinciples of the Bill to shops and business premises,since the tenants of such premises were sufferingfrom similar grievances to those of the small house-holder 0     &quot;While it was true that the business man canas a rule recoup himself from his customers for any additional charges imposed by his landlord there was atthe present time a wide spread feeling that, the tenants&quot;of business promises had legitimate grievances forwhich seine solution should be found ^and that theGovernment policy on the matter should be announced.The Minister of Health proposed that the veryintricate and controversial question Involved should - ....be referred for examination to a Select Committee ofthe House of Commons and that the Landlord and,fTenant Bill drafted for the Ministry of reconstruction in 1918 should be road a second time and referred tothat Committee or to a Joint Committee of the two houses.    To meet the Immediate difficulty it was proposed that pending tho report of the Select Committeethe tenancy of all business promises -(and perhaps ofall dwelling houses not covered in the Bill) expiringon and after (say) 85th Mar c-h last   should be extended or 24in June nextupon the same terms and conditions as the expiringperiod
ctt m 5period ending or December 25th, 1921, subject -(a) to an increase of rent not exceeding 50$ ofthe rent reserved by the expiring tenancy, and(b) to an appeal to the Court (defined as in.30(3)  of the Housing Act 1919) who mightdetermine the tenancy &quot;on the ground that&apos;   the landlord requires possession of theproperty in order  to carry cut some schemeof reconstruction or improvement,desirable in the public interest&apos;7 subject possibly to the payment of compensation for less of goodwill, etcIt was generally agreed that while the necessities of the case had forced the Governmentto pass legislation protecting the small householderthe whole principle of the Rent Restriction legislation was vicious, economically unsound and was responsible to a substantial degree for the present housingdifficulties.    To extend the principles of this legislation to shops end business premises would bring the dead hand of the State on to the commerciallife of the community and would tend to paralyse tradeand business.    The general feeling v.as that if theposition was carefully explained to the House ofCommons there was very little risk of the Housecarrying amendments extending the principle of thaBill.      Rith regard to the proposed temporary expedientit was pointed out if machinery was once sat up for fixing rents it -ould be moat difficult to go back onthat procedure.The attention cf the Conference was drawn to thevery real permanent grievance suffered by the tenants of business premises.    z-or example, a tenant may be forced to take a 14 years1 lease    He then proceedsto create a vr-lu&amp;la goodwill and at the expiration of the tenancy the landlord taxes advantage of theposition to exact excessive terms for the renewal

Memorandum by B. P Blackett



With reference to C.P. 1349, 1342 and 1369 on the resumption of trade with Russia, the proposal that Russian gold should be imported into this country direct or from Estonia or should be used as the basis of crredits in this country, raises somewhat complicated questions, and I wish to set forth briefly the main considerations regarding the matter from the point of view of the financial situation in this country.

The chief difficulty in the matter lies in the fact that M. Krassin and his colleagues cannot show an absolutely secure title to this gold. There can be no doubt that looking at the matter broadly it represents stolen property so long as the Bolshevik Government is unrecognised. It is not certain whether or not the creditors of Russia in this country could effectively embargo such gold or obtain an injunction from the Courts to prevent it being dealt with. But it is known that many of the most important people in the City have been advised that such proceedings might be successful, and that the moment any Russian gold arrives, they will attempt to establish their claim to it. The Bank of England is a large holder of frozen Russian Bills (as agent for the British  
Government)  and it -would&apos; &amp;e oound to protect it c interests (andours) &quot;bp following; suit as soon as other -creditors tried toembargo the geld.      It follows that such gold cannot properly be made the basis of -credits in tho same way as gold to which an absolutely good title can be shown;    and what  is of wore immediadre.importance,  it follows that the Bank of England ^ill refuse toaccept and pan/ for such gold.      It is however an essential part ofthe gold policy which, we have adopted,  that all gold should for tho^resent at any rate be sold, to the Bank of England.     The surnlusto30Id of the Joint Stock Banks has now been handed over/theBank cf England in accordance with this policy.    In short, we feel bound, to discourage: M. Erassin from making payment or obtainingcredit with this gold,  until he  can show an absolutely safe title to it  and until it   can safely be taken by the Bard; of England.It  should be explained that the proposal in paragraph1 of CP.  1349 that tho gold might be located in a neutral stateand credits opened in respect of it in this country,  is open to just as strong financial objections as the import of gold intothis country.      Under this scheme banks ,would open credits againstgold abroad, which wo deprecate in any crwe,  and in particularThen it  is gold which could not safely be brought to this country.As regards the machinery by means of which we candiscourage the use of this gold, although the import of gold is notin any way restricted^ we have two effective weapons:-1. few prudent bankers will accept Russian goldwithout some form of indemnity or promise of support from us*2.      tho gold cannot, be re-exported without licence sothat its price is the hone price of 8j?s. a fineounce instea.d of the world nrice of 10 s.
&quot;hlf. thi a. main, oh^-eciumm. aartn-ot&quot; aw rv-eTrc-onre (-and. theonly r owing  ous way to overcome it is to grant de facto recog-nition to the Bolshevik Government in same form or other)there remains the further difficulty that the Treasury and-the Bank rf England are strongly opposed to granting re-export licences to casual imports of gold.    Contracts havebeen made with south and west Africa and the Congo for the shipment to this country of the whole ef their output,  and any decision to grant re-export licences for casual imports of goldwould go far to influence the producers to terminate these contracts.    in addition,  it would he almost impossible toexercise effective control over &quot;casual&quot;  gold exported under11c en c e.5&apos;cld anywhere in Northern Europe finds extraordinaryphysical difficulty in getting away except to or through London,90 that the refusal of an export licence is a very effectiveweapon.    The Governor if the Bank holds that if we continue torefuse casual licences for export    the gold must-ultimately -come here at the Mint price (85s. per fine oz.).    If other difficulties are disposed of some arrangement must doubtless be made to meet the difficulty as to export licences,    proba-bly the most advantageous would be to insist on the gold being sold to the British government at a price somewhere betweenthe Mint price and the market price,  and if we so choose weare probably in a position to dictate the price.But it is obvious that until the legal title of theBolshevik Government is established beyond doubt,  no one is safe in dealing-with the gold at all.(intld.)    B.P.B..  S.whJune-   192Q.
The Prime Minister desires to he a.dvxs*xLwhethercrodito-rs of the former Russian Govtrrranont would &quot;bo ont-itlebL.to attach gold which might ho sent to this country   either bytho Soviet Government or by its agents.(a) if the gold were placed on deposit withbanks in this  country against which credits would be opened by the Russian Co-oporativeSocieties,  or some agents of the SovietGovernment,  for payment  of purchases to bemade.(b) if the gold wore handed over to a vendor in payment of goods still to be delivered or sohanded over in payment of an existing dobt,It is said that seme of the gold is in the form ofbar gold marked in such a way as to bo identifiable as thoproperty of the former Russian Government.Advice i.3    also  sought whether,  if the gold weredeposited in a foreign bank and that bank opened credits inLondon,  the  credits so  opened could be attached by cieditorsof the former Russian Government.29th -May,  1920.OPI1TIQIT .In Pur opinion all these questions are to be anworcd intho negative.      Kb foreign Government,  past or present,   isamenable to any form of process in the English Courts,  and we donot think that there is any legal method by which creditors oftho former Russian Government  could either establish their claim?or enforce them against property alleged to belong to thatGuvornmc nt .(Initialled)      G.
