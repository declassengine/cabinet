Member for the Scotland Division(Mr. 8&apos;Connor) really happens, if the SinnPeiners were in a majority, and refused towork our Parliament.   What would happenwould be that instantly we should revert
to tho present position, and if the Billdoes not make that clear   and I do notthink it does  - it must he made perfectlyplain that until the Parliament is properlyconstituted and has taken the oath, the Actcannot come onto operation.&quot;  (Par1jamentaryDebates, Vol. IB?,. No,g6,  p.1136.)( )    With reference to Cabinet 33  (so), Conclusion 5, theCabinet approved the following arrangements which had beenreached between the Prime Minister and the Ministers at thehead of the Departments concerned in regard to Datum:-(a) Colonel Stokes will start immediately forBatum,  entrusted with a Special mission from His Majesty&quot;s Government to negotiate an agreement with the Georgian government by which, under suitable conditions, theprovince and port of Batum will be handedover by the Allied forces to that Govern-ment.(b) He will be accompanied by M.

To approve the introduction of the Bill,subject to the foilowing(a) Agreement between the Presidentof the Board of Trade,  the lord president of the Council,  thePresident of the Board of Educa-tion and the Minister of Health,in regard to the Clauses relatingrespectively to research,  education and health:(b) In view of the strong desire ofthe mining community,  as expressed to members of the Government onnumerous occasions by the miners&apos;leaders, to have a voice in deter-mining the conditions of health and safety. Clause 2 of the Draft Bill,involving the transfer from the HomeOffice t* the Ministry of Mines ofthe responsibility fer the inspection and safety of the mines,  should stand:(c)  The operation of the Clause (Clause 2.0)providing for the levy of a fund to be devoted to improving the amenities ofthe mining district, should be limitedto ten   years,  and the objects of thefund should be widely interpreted soas to embrace not only mining buteducational and recreative facilities,and the composition of the Committee(Clause SC, - sub-section 3)  should beagreed between the President of theBoard of Trade,  the President of theBoard of Education and the Minister ofHealth:(d) The withdrawal of Clause 16,  requiringan undertaking by workers in c*al minesnet to cease work pending proceedings for the settlement of disputes:(e) At the introduction&apos; of the Bill an explanation should be made of the omission of royalties from this bill,  and an undertaking given thatthe Government proposed to bring ina Pill this Session to deal withroyalties,  *ri the lines of the PrimeMinister&apos;s pledge.
tf-     (5)  With reference to Cabinet SB (SO), Conclusion&quot;5,- theOabdjaeit^jfuj^t^ the profitsarising out of the Cotton Control Scheme in Egypt during theWar.It wan pointed out that, while we had undertaken toboar half the losses of the Scheme, the disposal of theprofits (if any) had been left to be agreed upon by the twoGovernments.    The Borne Government had,  in fact,  borne very real risks,  and in equity was entitled to halve the profits.On the other hand,  it was recognised that the political argu-ments against this course were very strong,  owing to theinflamed state of Egyptian opinion and the importance of doing nothing to prejudice the conversations which wore at presenttaking place with a view ,to allaying the discontent in Egypt.In the course of the discussion it was suggested thata possible solution might be to allow the Egyptian Governmentto have  3,000,000 and to allocate the remaining  1,000,000to the promotion of the cotton industry, and especially of research within the Empire.    Attention v&apos;as drawn to the reaction of any such solution unon the Wool Agreement with australia.The Cabinet decided  To ad,--ourn the question pending the con-elusion of the negotiations now proceed-ing with representative Egyptians.
.000(6) With reference to Cabinet 33 (20),  Conclusion 4,the Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandum by theSecretary for Scotland and the President of the Board ofTrade,  stating that any improvement in the general herringsituation which the Export Credits Scheme could producewould not be such as to enable the fishermen to put to sea and make a living,  in view of the absence of immediateopportunities to dispose of the goods for cash;    nor couldmuch,  if any, reliance be placed on the disposal of herringsto the countries assisted by the Relief Credits (Paper O.P.-1440) .The Cabinet were informed that the announcement oftheir refusal to assist the trade had caused dismay through-out the fishing community of G-eat Britain;    local author!-ties were passing, resolutions of protest, and agitators were beginning to prey on what was normally a peaceful industry.The representatives of the fioherfoik would,  it was believed,be willing to proceed on a Treasury guarantee of  2,000,as against  3,500,000 which they had previously asked forScotland.    On this basis the maximum guarantee for both countries would be  4,000, 000.After some discussion tho Cabinet agreed  (a) To accept a suggestion made by the presidentof the Board of Trade that he should foregothe use under the Export Credits Scheme ofsxich sum as he found feasible in order thatit might be devoted, to the assistance of theFnslish and Scottish Herring Fishery:(b) That the President of the Board of Trade,the Secretary for Scotland and the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries,  should concerta scheme for the application of the aboveguarantee in the most economical and advan-tageous manner, and should, jalg^aOMa,consider the advisability of reducing prices and, indirectly, wages:(o) That under the guarantee the Governmentihts / should have priority /over a number ofbarrels for export: A(d) That Sir Robert Home, Mr Munro and LordLee should meet the representatives of theindustry and endeavour to come to an agree-ment within the limits of the above scheme.

CABINET.

GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND BILL.



NOTE by Mr W. LONG, covering Draft of the Suspensory Clause.



I circulate to the Cabinet a draft of the Suspensory Clause which carries out the assurances, given in the Debate on Second Reading and on other occasions, that powers would be inserted in the Bill to suspend its operation in the event of the Parliament of Southern Ireland either refusing to function or endeavouring to act unconstitutionally.

I hope the Cabinet will come to a decision on this important question at our meeting tomorrow, as I am convinced that it will be difficult to carry the Bill, without delaying tactics being adopted in the House, until we have our Amendment on the Paper.

It is,  no doubt, drastic, but it is necessary if we are to convince the Sinn-Feiners and, indeed, a good many others, that we mean business; that this Bill is a reality; and that, if it is not put into force, then other measures will have to be adopted. It has been impossible to submit this in its present form to the Committee.(Int.) W.H.L.

NEGOTIATIONS WITH M. KRASSIN.



With reference to Cabinet 33 (20). Conclusion (7)(c)the Conference met to consider the reply of M. Krassin 

to the questions which had been put to him at the Conference held on May 31, 1920 (C.P. 1421)  and to advise the prime minister as to the line which should be taken with M. Krausin at a further meeting, which was to be held that afternoon.



(a) Release of British subjects in Russia.



The attention of the Conference was drawn to the statement made in para. 1 of M. Krassin&apos;s reply (C.P.1421) that there were a number of Russians in England who, inspite of the agreement made between M. Litvinoff and Mr. O&apos;Grady, were prevented by the British Government from leaving England.

The Conference were informed that the British Government had decided that every Russian who desired to do so should be allowed to return to Russia. The Soviet Government, however, had refused to take all the Russians in question, but desired to select only a limited number (125 persons). To this the Foreign Office had objected,  and had insisted that all Russians who wished to return to Russia should be allowed to do so. 

The Conference agreed:-

That the policy hitherto adopted by the British Government should be confirmed, and that M. Kraisin should be informed that the British Government had no objection whatever to all Russians who wished to do so returning to Russia.

(b) Anti-British Propaganda.



The Conference took note of the statement made in para. 2 of M. Krassin&apos;s reply (C.P.1421) regarding Anti-British propaganda, and agreed -

That the guarantee proposed by M. Krassin was sufficiently wide in its terms.



(c) Position of General Wrangel?.

 

With reference to para. 6 of M. Krassin&apos;s reply(C.P. 1421), some discussion ensued as to the line which should/




should be taken in regard to General Wrangel&apos;s army.

 The Conference were informed that General Wrangel&apos;s army in the Crimea was now in good condition, and an important military factor. If General Wrangel were to make an attack it would be because he could not live on the Crimea, and was obliged to advance in order to obtain food for his Forces. It was therefore suggested that the British Government should state that they could not support General Wrangel in a policy of aggression outside the Crimea and that such a policy would have to be undertaken by him on his own responsibility. If, however, General Wrangel would remain quiescent, the British Government would endeavour to come to an arrangement with the Soviet Government, and would in the meanwhile use their best endeavours to furnish foodstuffs to his Forces.

The Conference agreed that in regard to General Wrangel a statement should be made to M. Krassin in the following sense:-

The British Government is willing to mediate between the army of General Wrangel and the Soviet Government with a view to securing effective guarantees for the security of these forces and of the refugees they are protecting. His Majesty&apos;s Government will not support offensive action by the army of General Wrangel outside the limits of the Crimea, and in the event of General Wrangel refusing mediation or refusing to accept what in the opinion of H. M. Government are effective guarantees for their security, H.M. Government will feel freed from all further responsibility on their account. If, on the other hand, the Soviet Government refuse to give what H.M. Government regard as effective guarantees for security in regard to General Wrangel&apos;s forces, and endeavour to attack their place of refuge in the Crimea, H.M. Government will consider themselves free to take any course they think fit.

(d)










(d) British Naval Forces in the Baltic, and Black Sea.



The Conference took note of the suggestion in para. 7 of M. Krassin&apos; s note (C.P. 1421), that all warships belonging to Powers not possessing territory bordering the Baltic and the Black Sea, should be withdrawn from those Seas.



It was generally agreed:-



That this request was impossible.



(c) Attitude of the Polish Government.



The opinion was expressed that the Polish Government was desirous of entering upon peace negotiations with the Soviet Government,  but were waiting for a remarkable success before doing so. The military position was distinctly favourable at the moment to the Poles, who were also stated to be arranging for the transport of corn supplies from the Ukraine to Central Europe.

The Conference were generally agreed:-

  

That it would be impossible for the British Government to made the first suggestion to the Polish Government of peace negotiations with the Soviet Government, since the British Government would in that case be held to have incurred a certain responsibility in the event of any failure of those negotiations.



(f)Minefields in the Baltic.



With reference to Conclusion 1 of the Conference of ministers held on June 3rd at 5.30 p.m., the Conference were informed that in the opinion of the Admiralty the duty of sweeping-up minefields in the Baltic was one which should be undertaken by Russian and German minesweepers, minesweepers, and in no circumstancses by British sailors or vessels. Few of the mines in the Baltic were British mines.

NEGOTIATIONS WITH M. KRASSIN.



With reference to Cabinet 33(20). Conclusion (7)(c) the Conference met to consider the reply of M. Krassin to the questions which had been put to him at the Conference held on May 31, 1920 (C.P. 1421) and to advise the Prime Minister as to the line which should be taken with M. Krassin at a further meeting which was to be held that afternoon.



(a) Release of British subjects in Russia.



The attention of the Conference was drawn to the statement made in para. 1 of M. Krassin&apos;s reply (C.P,1421) that there were a number of Russians in England who, inspite of the agreement made between M. Litvinoff and Mr. O&apos;Grady, were prevented by the British Government from leaving England.

The Conference were informed that the British Government had decided that every Russian who desired to do so should be allowed to return to Russia. The Soviet Government, however, had refused to take all the Russians in question, but desired to select only a limited number (125 persons). To this the Foreign Office had objected, and had insisted that all Russians who wished to return to Russia should be allowed to do so.

The Conference agreed;-

That the policy hitherto adopted by the British Government should be confirmed, and that M. Krassin should be informed that the British Government had no objection whatever to all Russians who wished to do so returning to Russia. 



(b) Anti-British Propaganda.



The Conference took note of the statement made in para.  2 of M. Krassin&apos;s reply (C.P.1421)  regarding Anti-British propaganda, and agreed -



That the guarantee proposed by M. Krassin was sufficiently wide in its terms.



(c) Position of General Wrangel.



With reference to para. 6 of M. Krassin&apos;s reply (C.F. 1421), some discussion ensued as to the line which should/


 should be taken in regard to General Wrangel&apos;s army.

The Conference were informed that General Wrangel&apos;s army in the Crimea was now in good condition, and an important military factor. If General Wrangel were to make an attack it would be because he could not live on the Crimea, and was obliged to advance in order to obtain food for his Forces. It was therefore suggested that the British Government should state that they could not support General Wrangel in a policy of aggression outside the Crimea and that such a policy would have to be undertaken by him on his own responsibility. If, however, General Wrangel would remain quiescent, the British Government would endeavour to come to an arrangement with the Soviet Government, and would in the meanwhile use their best endeavours to furnish foodstuffs to his Forces.

The Conference agreed that in regard to General Wrangel a statement should be made to M. Krassin in the following sense:-

The British Government is willing to mediate between the army of General Wrangel and the Soviet Government with a view to securing effective guarantees for the security of these forces and of the refugees they are protecting. His Majesty&apos;s Government will not support offensive action by the army of General Wrangel outside the limits of the Crimea, and in the event of General Wrangel refusing mediation or refusing to accept what in the opinion of H.M. Government are effective guarantees for their security, H.M. Government will feel freed from all further responsibility on their account. If, on the other hand, the Soviet Government refuse to give what H.M. Government regard as effective guarantees for security in regard to General Wrangel&apos;s forces, and endeavour to attack their place of refuge in the Crimea, H.M. Government will consider themselves free to take any course they think fit.

(d)


British ? Forces ? the Baltic, ? Black Sea.



The Conference took note of the suggestion in para. 7 of M. Krassin&apos;s note (C.F.1421), that all warships belonging to Powers not possessing territory bordering the Baltic and the Black Sea, should be withdrawn from those Seas.

It was generally agreed:-

    That this request was impossible.



(?) Attitude of the Polish government.



The opinion was expressed that the Polish Government was desirous of entering upon peace negotiations with the Soviet Government, but were waiting for a remarkable success before doing so. The military position was distinctly favourable at the moment to the Poles, who were also stated to be arranging for the transport of corn supplies from the Ukraine to Central Europe.

The Conference were generally agreed:-

That it would be impossible for the British Government to make the first suggestion to the Polish Government of peace negotiations with the Soviet Government, since the British Government would in that case be held to have incurred a certain responsibility in the event of any failure of those negotiations.



(f) Minefields in the Baltic.



With reference to Conclusion 1 of the Conference of Ministers held on June 3rd at 5.30 p.m, the Conference were informed that in the opinion of the Admiralty the duty of sweeping-up minefields in the Baltic was one which should be undertaken by Russian and German minesweepers, and in no circumstances by British sailors or vessels. Few of the mines in the Baltic were British mines.
