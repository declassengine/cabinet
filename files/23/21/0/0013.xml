11148LfATIONS (1) The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the CabinetklSSION -fBOH REPRE- that he had received a telegram from the British AmbassadorRation on.in Paris, reporting that M. Dubois was,  in hia opinion, avery suitable representative for the Reparations Commission,and stating that the French would take it as a compliment if sir John Bradbury could propose him as Chairman.The Cabinet took note of, and approved,the Intention of the Chancellor of theExchequer to telegraph to Sir john bradbury,  forwarding Led Derby&apos;s re-commendation and authorising him, ifhe thought fit, to take the course proposed.This course was agreed to in the distinctunderstanding that the  Secretary-Generalcontinued to&quot;be of British nomination.
ALLIED. (2) Wttft .refaivmoe. XeTbMjyguw^b), Conclusion 4,vi DEBTS, the Cabinet had before them the following--documents onthe subject of Inter-Allied and Anglo-American Debts:-Memoranda by the Chancellor of the Fx cheque &apos;(Papers CP.-584,  597 and 842), &quot; *.Memoranda by the President of the Board ofTrade (Papers CP.-621 and&quot; 1302),A Memorandum by the secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (Paper- C.P.-1093),A Memorandum by the secretary of State forWar (Paper CP,-1156),A Memorandum by Sir L, Worthington Evans,(Paper CP, 1155) , &apos; &apos;A Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,covering a Memorandum by Mr B.PPBlaekett(Paper C.P.-1S59),A Note by the Secretary,  Cabinet,  of the &apos;Conversations at Kythe (Patter CP.1297),A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor War (Pape- CP..-1S16).The Chancellor of the Exchequer then made a ve^r full statement of the present position of the,, question witn theUnited States Treasury.    A summary of this statement isgiven in the APPendix.In the course of the subsequent diseusaJon it waspointed out that, under the American proposals, the deferredbonds,  into which the interest payable during the next year or two on the American loans was to be converted, were to, bemarketable after five years,  although before&apos; they were puton the market Creat Britain was to be given the opportundipyto pay money down.    Clearly,  once these bonds had been puton the market, all chance of their &quot;emission or cancellationunder any scheme of Inter-Allied indebtedness would be atan end.    Consequently, the position as regards Inter-Alliedindebtedness would be gravely compromised by agreeing to this.It was strongly urged that no action should be taken nowwhich in any way tended to compromise the fixture of thealsoquestion.    It was &apos; pointed out that, the present
question of this kind finally with America/ owing to the abnormal political position there,  due to the approach of the Presidential Elections.    Further,  it was&apos;.suggestedthat there was every advantage in not dealing alone with america in this question.    Prance and Italy had the sameinterests as o\i-selves vis- -vis America,  and it would be.better to discuss the matter in a Conference in which they also would be represented.    The Lympne (Hythe)  Conferenceintroduced new factors which would justify us in notpressing forward with the present independent negotiations.It was urged that it was no more dishonourable for GreatBritain to defer paying her interest than it was for france or Italy to fail in this respect-    Everything was to be gained by postponing a decision.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That, having regard to the questions of high policy raised by the settlement ofthis question,  it was one that should bedealt with direct between the Govern-ments concerned,  rather&quot; than between thetwo &quot;Treasuries&quot;.(b) That the Prime Minister should address a communication on the subject direct to president Wilson:(c) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should immediately notify this decisionto Mr Rathbone, the representative ofthe United States Treasury.
Cabinet 27 (20),  Conclusion 3, the Cabinet had under-conaid-&apos;ELIT. eration the action to be taken in North Persia in view ofIN        the recent evacuation of Rnzeli.    From the consideration ofIbrsia.the local aspects of this question the discussion extended!L0-1 AHHFP-first to the question of what was the role of these british forces in North Persia, and the situation which would beINAND       created in the event of their withdrawal.    This led to a?E0T onAiilA.    discussion of the Anglo-Persian Agreement ,and out obligationsthereunder to iersia in the event of a Bolshevist attack.?07&apos;ARDSThe position in Mesopotamia in the event of a Bolshevistpenetration of Persia then came in for review.    Finally,  theqrPH-CON-     decision was found to be closely connected with. ou&quot; generalIONS.KRAS-   policy towards Soviet Russia.As regards the local situation at Fnzeli,  it appeared fromH3RS the previous Cabinet decisions ana teles raws brought to the3IA.notice of the Cabinet, that the position is as follows.VALRRS Pver since the British occupation of Baku, an Anglo-Indian[J.force has been maintained at Enzeli,  in North Persia,  on theORCaspian Sea, which has recently numbered from 500 to 700raen, together with some guns and transport.    In February .last, when Denikin&apos;s army was still an effective fightingforce and the Allies were encouraging the Caucasian states to resist the Bolsheviks, the General &apos;Staff had advocatedits retention.    In view of the changed conditions, however,the question of their retention had recently been examined by the Eastern Committee,  and on May 18th &amp;. telegram (No.268)had been sent to Persia coa.munica.ting the decision that this force was to be maintained for the present, though it was left to the discretion of the General Officer Commanding to retire upon KasVin should the Fnzeli position be in &quot;ealdanger or should a large- force be required at Kasvin.Within the last few days the Bolsheviks had disembarked a force of some 2,000 men some miles from Enzeli, which had cut the line of retreat of the British forces the&quot;e.   Announcing&quot;that he was actins on his own responsibility and without.
orders from Moscow, the Bolshevist Commander after bombarding the port, had stated that his sole objective was Denikin&apos;s fleet which had been surrendered to British officers at Enzeli and subsequently disarmed and interned. This fleet still flew the Russian flag. The British forces had thereupon been allowed to march out to Resht, where they had probably arrived by this time. In the meanwhile, a Naval detachment of about 3 officers and 30 men, which had been despatched from the Black Sea for the purpose of taking over the guns of Denikin&apos;s fleet at Enzeli, had been caught en route at Baku on the arrival there of the Bolsheviks. They had been made prisoners, and were reported to be subjected to ill-treatment and forced labour in the dockyard.

The War Office asked for authority to evacuate Enzeli and Tabriz: to concentrate these forces at Kasvin, together with certain battalions on the lines of communications, these military dispositions -- which would take some weeks to effect -- being taken with a view to an early withdrawal to Hamadan, Kermanshah, and eventually to the railhead in Mesopotamia.

This request was supported on the following grounds. The forces at Tabriz and Enzeli are costing Â£2,000,000 a year, owing to the immense amount of mechanical transport required for the long lines of communication.  Coupled with the retention of the force at Meshed beyond the time originally contemplated, this would involve asking Parliament for a Supplementary Estimate.  The Enzeli incident shows that these forces only remain in North Persia on sufferance of the Bolsheviks. Since the Cabinet decision of last February to retain them, the whole situation has been changed by the collapse of Denikin, the Bolshevist invasion of the Caucasus and the Bolshevist command of the Caspian Sea.  The danger existed for our forces in North Persia not only from the Bolsheviks but also from the Persian Cossacks, some of whom were contaminated with Bolshevism, and a detachment of which
was actually between Tabriz and Kasvin. The policy of withdrawal from the Caucasus was

based on military advice that our line of defence in South Asia should be neither the line Constantinople-Batum-Baku-Krasnovodsk-Merv, nor the line Constantinople-Batum-Enzeli- Teheran-Meshed, but should be the railheads of the systems of Palestine, Mesopotamia and India, where our forces would be securely based on steam transport by rail and, in the case of Mesopotamia, by river.

At the same time, and on the same broad grounds, the War Office pressed for a withdrawal from Batum. This withdrawal, however, was also urged on the following additional grounds, namely, that, in the opinion of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, which he expressed personally to the Cabinet, the British force was in danger from a rising in the town, from the advance of the Bolsheviks, and from the uncertain attitude of the Georgians. This view was based on the opinion of the General Officer Commanding, Constantinople, that the position was "militarily unsound and dangerous". The French had only sent an Algerian Battalion (which sailed yesterday from Constantinople) instead of the promised white Battalion, and the Italians absolutely declined to implement their promise to send a Battalion. The instructions to General Milne to withdraw the force in the event of actual danger were very similar to those that had been given to the General Officer Commanding in Persia as regards Enzeli, and just as the Enzeli force had not been withdrawn in time, so General Milne, who was not on the spot at Batum and could have no very immediate knowledge of the situation, might not have time to withdraw the Batum force. Public opinion would not stand a repetition at Batum of what had happened at Enzeli. The railway from Batum had been cut, and the moment was approaching when, if these forces were retained, we should incur responsibility for feeding the population of the town.


Tbvtum the. former reasons were.rged, namely,  that the retention o f - this&quot; &quot;fxr-ae -had beenrepeatedly approved by the Cabinet and by the  lunreme -O^uocli,of the Allies;    the situation had not  altered f.o&quot; the worse,and would be iap^ov^d by the arrival oT&quot; the French A&apos;J ger ianBattalion;    it was impossible to conduct a policy whenchanges we^e made so hastily,    the retention of Batur aslong as possible was desirable in order to avoid a junctionbetween hustapha Xemal and the Bolsheviks,  in order toprevent Georgia becoming Bolshevist and thus opening a freshlino o^ Bolshevist advance int o Persia by&apos;the railway toTabriz;    also as a port fo&quot;&quot; the passage of arms to Armenia;if the Georgians made an arrangement with the Bolsheviks weshould withdraw;    and in the meanwhile General Milne had full authority to withdraw if he considered the force was threaten--ed with danger.would be tantamount to an invitation to the Bolsheviks toenter and make themselves master of Perth Persia;    the friendlyPersian Government would then fall;    there would be an end tothe Anglo-Persian Agreement which, without infringing theindependence of Persia, had been concluded with the object ofos+ablishlnp decent  conditions and providing a barrier against bolshevism;    the hopes that the Anglo-Persian Agreement would serve as a model for the administration of Egypt and Kesopot-Stefania would disappear:    in time the Bolsheviks would eitherpenetrate to the bo-vie &quot;s of Mesopotamia^ or Persia, permeatedby Bolshevism, would go rotten;    our position in Mesopotamia,could then only be secured by much large&quot; forces than we wereprepared to maintain there;    the reaction of our abandonment of Persia would weaken our whole position in the East.    Eventhough the Anglo-Persian Agreement contained no treatyobligation on us to defend Persia, it was urged as an obliga-tion of self-interest which we could not afford to set aside,polxcy ofAgainst the,withdrawalit was urged that it
and if we abandoned it we should ha-e to cons ids&quot; Aether weo ould &quot; &apos; run in a e sopb t n ia.Against this,- however,  it was tainted out that there wasnn evidence that the loisheviks had designs on Persia.    Thevhem many p&quot;ior commitments in re-organising their- own country,in driving out the Poles,  and in establishing their boundar-ies.    Their communications were notoriously deficient,  andwould probably not enable them +0 invade a country like Pe--sia, where even we, with all our resources,  found difficultyin maintaining a small force;    Persia was not a rich countrylikely to attract them.    Even if they entered Persia,  it wouldbe long before they could penetrate as far as the bordersof Kesaopr-ta-ia.    It was more probable that they would seektheir1 aims by means of propaganda,  -raioh our occupation wouldnot prevent&quot;,    or it was possible that thei-* object might be-to re-establish 4 he position Russia had occupied in BerthPersia under the Anglo-Pe^sian Agreement.    The British people would never embark on a difficult and costly war for then-j-rios&quot; of o^e^enting the Bolsheviks from establishing this position, or oven for preventing a Russian invasion of Persia,It was urged that  our present attitude tow a mas the Persianswas a false one.    ae ought to recogni.se that we had not themilitary forces available to enable the..- to keep the Bolshe-boisheviks out.   As we could not do this,  we ought to encourage the Persians 4 o conclude some arrangement a with the Bolsheviks.Bp to the present we had &quot;ather deterred them from doinyso,Eventually it was recognised that oar policy in north persia was inti ately connected with our general/Policy towardsthe Bolsheviks.    This,  it was contended, was at presentindefinite and somewhat paradoxical.    On the one hand, theBolsheviks were making difficulties for us all over the East,in Turkey, the Caucasus,  Persia, Turkestan and Afghanistan,and had not concealed their intention to create trouble forus in India.    On the/ether hand, we were intermediating betweenthe Bolsheviks and the remnant of Denikin&apos;s forces under
trading relations with the::.,  in which conne^tlx*rr^a^l,olali^vd.6deputation was at this moment negotiating in- London; andL. Krassin, a prominent Bolshevist Minister, was about tocome to London,  and had made as one of th:- conditions ofhis visit that he should be seen by the p-ime Minister andthe Foreign 0Pfiqe.It-was stated that there was evidei-.ee to show that thedifficulties the Bolsheviks have been making for us in theEast are a remnant of an earlier policy initiated when wewere actively supporting Denikin, which had since been abandoned and which the Bolsheviks were t pying to bring toan end.    ?he Cabinet generally felt, however, that advantage should be taken of the forthcoming conversations with KbKrassin,  if possible,  as a condition of entering into trade relations, to effect an all-round settlement which would include the East as well as the  delivery of Britishsubjects still retained in Bolshevist hands,  or,  at anyrate,  to clear uo the situation and to establish exactlyhow we stand with the Bolsheviks.    It was felt that thespeediest manner of effecting the release of the Naval pris-oners at Baku would be to deal with this question also inthe forthcoming conversations with bl.  Krassin,    For theabove reasons the.hops was expressed that every effortwraflH b^  -t^- to facilitate Id. XrassirPs arrival,The Cabinet agreed on the following decisionsGENERAL .PPPLT0P,BC&apos;p\.PPS  RUSSIA.(a) Advantage should be taken of the forthcomingconversations with IS. Krassin to endeavuur to clear up our whole situation via-V-vl.;. SovietRussia,  including not only the question oftrade relations, which is the ostensiblesubject  of the conversations, but also theoosition in the   Riddle East, the questionof the release of British prisoners fromRussia,  and nf the Naval prisoners detainedat Baku.rjikK^EJ^LIA.(b) The decision as to the policy to be adoptedin North Persia should b*&apos; postponed until after the above conversations.
In the meanwhile the War Office should give instructions for carrying out the military dispositions they propose for a concentration at Kasvin of the military forces in North Persia, including those at Tabriz and Resht. In the event of any obstruction to this concentration, whether by the Bolsheviks or the Persian Cossacks, the General Officer should have discretion to take such military action as he may deem essential and prudent.

(c) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should ascertain whether any surplus arms are available for Persia.                                                                       (d) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in reply to the Persian appeals for assistance, should not encourage hopes that any financial assistance can be furnished, or any material assistance beyond the supply of arms, and these only if they are found to be available.

BATUM.

(e) In view of the importance of avoiding at Batum a repetition of what recently occurred at Enzeli, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff should call the attention of General Milne to his previous instructions, and direct him to report his views as to the present situation there.

ARMENIA.

(f) The War Office should complete the shipment of war material for Armenia, which has been interrupted by the refusal of the dock labourers to load it.

(g) The Cabinet took note that the War Office considered it unjustifiable, in existing conditions, to send British officers, even those who volunteered, to Armenia, where, in certain eventualities, they would run grave risk of being out off from all possibility of assistance, and perhaps even from every avenue of escape.

^xnajARy of a -statement by the cwjkhli+k^&apos; &quot;&quot; &apos;OF THE EXCREQLuBR, . OK THE SCBJiij. OFINTETWOLIED INDEBTEDNESSThe British Government has a debt of approximately 1.o00j00x- h-oo sterling in the United States of America,  in-eluding a good deal of money  at  call.    In respect of part ofthat debt America holds certain bonds,  shares,  etc., whichwere given to American bankers as security before the UnitedStates came into the War.    After the entry of America intothe War, the United States Government took over these debts,,and with them they took over the securities which werecollateral for those debts.    The British Government pays% per cent, to the holders of these securities.    The Treasurywore now anxious to get the securities back and return themto their owners.Interest has been due en the outstanding debt for sometime,   but the United States Government agreed to postpone fora period,  one of their conditions being that the principalshould be converted from demand obligations int. o definitivebonds.    Congress had said that the United States treasury had no authority to waive their right to the interest even onthis condition.-    The United States Government, with difficulty,managed to persuade Congress that they had this power on con-dition that the immediate demand obligation was transformed   .into bonds for deferred payment.    Mr Blackett,  of the Treasury,had been conducting negotiations on this basis with Mr Rath-bone, the representative of the American Treasury in Europe,since last September.    His instructions had been discussed andrecorded in a Paper of the Finance Committee dat -ml September1919 (Paper p.0.-1). In the course of these negotiations cor-resnondence took place, which Mr Chamberlain proceeded to read.This correspondence came to an end on January 14,  1920, and asa result the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the subsequent, ne--negotiations, had proceeded on the understanding that it was theintentionI
&apos; 160-of -AinerrLca-it^^ to each of thedebtors, and that public opijai^rMrul^-^favourable treatment to any of the debtors as an unfrxendTly &quot;act.    The American Treasury had replied, however,  in thecense that the United States Government considered that theyhad. done all that they could be expected to do after they came into the 5ar, but that what had happened before was nottheir affair, and that they assumed that each debtor would cease to borrow and do its best to arrange to repay what itowed them.    They recognised that in the case of some of theEuropean States the circumstances Would prevent the debtorsfrom oar^yin? out this desire, but they were only.willing torecognise this in each case where it could be shown to be ofove--whelming disadvantage to the State concerned or to theworld at large, including the United States. - Eventuallythey had presented the Treasury with a long draft Agreement,and had proposed that, when we had accepted it, they and weshould p.o together to our French and Italian debtors and ask them to accept an Agreement on the same lines.    In terms, theAgreements proposed between Great Britain and the UnitedStates,  and between Great Britain and the United States,  onthe one hand, and France and Italy on the other,  did not differ,  out in reality they differed materially.A stipulation was included that,as soon aa the Exchange value of any two debtor and creditorcountries reached par, payment of the interest on the debt   .should be made.    The reason why this rendered the Agreementone-sided was that whereas the sovereign might, and probablywould,  reach par^therer&apos;was no chance of this happening withthe f^anc and the lire.    Behind this proposal of the Ameri-cans was the reason that in their view the sovereign might go to par because Great Britain was fortunate, and the franc and the lire would not go to par because they wereunfortunate,  and it was therefore justifiable,  in their view,  to make the more fortunate country pay.      The American
granh .5 of 0.P.-1259, according to which the terns described by dir. Rathbone as  &quot;liberal&quot; were conditioned on reparationmatters and other matters such as tariffs and concessions,being arranged subject to the approval of the Secretary ofthe American Treasury.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer,  onreading this, had inf or. ed Mr Rat ho one that he could neverinsult the French by presenting such a demand to them, andso far as Great Britain was concerned he could never&apos;consent to sell his country into bondage by accepting it.    He would   -rather pay if he could, or default if he could not.    Mr Rath-bone had then stated that he :.had^.ajo^l err^^ -t o make ,., but-trajs^Jua^^                            -the-ob jemrtxonable&quot;paragraph Into a letter to accompany the draft Agreement, -and-Mr Chamberlain had felt he had no course but to decline toreceive such a letter.    There was little doubt that theUnited States wanted to use this Agreement as a weapon to compel what they considered proper cond.itions^as-regards&quot;the-Cerman ijademnitym,Mr Chamber lain&apos;s view was that Americaninsistence on an Agreement of this kind would justify theBritish Government in defaulting if they could not pay;    andif they were compelled to default,  the  justification on broad political grounds would be so strong that it wouldscarcely affect their credit.Mr  Rathbone had left London, but before leaving had stated that, he was willing to come back on June 2nd or 3rd,before catching his boat at Cherbourg on June 6th.    mr chamberlain had informedMr Rathbone that he had reported the question in general terms to the Cabinet, but that theyhad not yet had time to consider it in detail, and that hewould be glad to avail himself of Mr Rathbone&apos;3 offer toreturn.At the very end of the above negotiations had come theBympne (Jlythe) Conference.    The French there had started
from, the^Tr^^o^-^ Xondonb;,  the Allies on economic-affairs, that Europe could not  ?etback to normal economic conditions until the obligationsbetween the enemy and the Allies and between the Allies andthe United States among themselves had been settled. U.&apos; Marsalhad begun   by pointing out that no-one knew the assets orliabilities of the enemy or of the Allies, and the&quot; consequencewas that no-one had any credit.    The only decisions reached at that  Conference had been those contained in the Communique&apos;&apos;.understandingAn important.( however, had been not to re-open thearrangement in regard to priorities,&apos;whereby the BritishEmpire received . 5. for every  11 received by Prance.    In theend, after many projects and counter-projects had been dis-cussed, all these were referred, on the suggestion of theFrench,  to the Experts.. The Conclusion of the Lymone Confer-ence had contained the following sentence&apos;:-&quot;The two Governments are further of opinionthat,  in order to provide a solution for theeconomic difficulties which are gravelyweighing upon- the general situation of theworld,  and in order to mark a definite begin-&apos;ning of the era of peace, it is important toarrive at a settlement which will embracethe whole body of the international liability-ities which have been left as a legacy of the^r, and which will at the same time ensure a parallel liquidation of the Inter-AlliedWar Debts and of the Reparation Debts of theC ent ral Prapi re s&quot;.One advantage - of this arrangement was that if the Frenchshowed themselves unreasonable towards the Gormans, ire shouldbe in a position to adopt a similar attitude towards them,and,  consequently,- to check them.    In view of the suggestions made by the French at the Lympne Conference, Mr Chamberlainproposed to tell ilr Rathbone that he could not deal with theFrench debt at the same time or in the same temps as the debt to the United States.of America.    He would be preparedto give bonds in regard to part of the debt on the teamsprovisionally settled between Mr Plackett and IvPr Rathbone,but he would reneat that if he gave the bonds it must be without Prejudice to any general settlement of Inter-Allied
^ ^ w--e   w-^-^ai^rt^^^ mating ^xr^xLoJrrliLx&apos; ijhamberlalnreferred.    The first related -to debts incurred by us on behalfof our Allies.    Our contention was that,  but for obligationsincurred on behalf of our Allies, we could have financed theWar without incurring debts.    This, however, was a difficult matter to prove definitely,  owing to-the complication involved by such considerations as the fact that we had bought wheat in America to replace wheat which we had bought  in India, but which,in order to reduce the voyage through dangerous waters,had been landed in Italy.    Similarly, as regards steel, wehad bought steel in America to replac- steel which had alreadybeen put into manufacture for our Allies.    Such considera-* ions introduced matters of controversy, and made it difficultto prove our case.    Mr-Blackett, however, had reached a fairly satisfactory agreement in regard to these matters..The American claim for 180,.000,,000 dollars had been reducedto 6,000,000 net,  but this had only been accomplished bytransferring the debt. f-&apos;om a disputed to an undisputed account.Another subsidiary question was the repayment of the Pitmansilver,   on which a satisfactory settlement had also beenreached.    Both these settlements, however, were dependent onthe main agreement as to the transfer of part of the interestimmediately payable to a.system of deferred bonds.During the War, a prono sal had been made to America thatwe would cease to borrow the-e if America would tame over our obligations f&quot;o.m Prance and Italy.    America would have aocept-ed this if the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the day hadbeen willing to state that Great Britain was at the end of   ,her resources.    Mr Bonar Law had refused to make a statementso damaging to our credit,  and the matter had fallen through.Later in the War, Lord llilner had taken a similar line, - andhad strongly urged that no statement that we could not payour obligations from our own resources should be issued.    Onthe whole, our financial position had improved from thecourageous attitude that we had adopted.    If we were now to
