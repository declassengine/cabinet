At the same time, both sides,agreed that the undertakings could not afford an increasedwage so long as the charges to the Public were kept within&apos;&apos;the existing statutory maximum.      The Ministry of transport had power to take over undertakings owned by Companies andto authorise an increase in the charges above the statutorymaximum,  but they had no such power in respect of Tramwaysowned by Municipal Authorities.      The accounts had bdenexamined and it was quite clear that,  with the existing charthe Companies could not afford higher wages at present.    Hehad therefore undertaken to recommend to the Cabinet at theearliest possible moment that a Bill should be introducedpermitting the charges to bo increased above the statutorymaximum.      The workmen refused to be satisfied,  without apublic announcement that the Government were taking stepsto have the charges raised,  and had been told by their leaders to hand in notices for a strike to take effect asfrom April 3rd.It was proposed to introduce a Bill extending thepowers of the Ministry of Transport so as to enable them, toauthorise an increase,  above the statutory maximum,  of charges to the public for tram-fares in the case of tramsowned

It was stated that it wouldbe possible to prosecute the Daily Herald under B,0,R.A.,and that probably a conviction could be obtained,  but it wasquestioned whether it would be wise- to give the daily herald the wide advertisement which such a course would ensure,The Conference decided ;-To defer the further discussion of  thismatter until the present negotiations onthe coal situation were conluded.2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1;29th March,  1920.

SAFE-KEEPING       1.     With reference to the Conclusions of theCP1 LETHALFF ?negotiations. Conference held on February 2nd, 1920, regardingthe safe-keeping of lethal weapons, and the questionof making such weapons ovaliable to loyalists inthe event of en emergency (Conference of February2nd,  1920, Conclusion 1(2)), the Conference had underconsideration the Report of General Sir NevilMacreadyhs Committee which had been appointed togo  into the matter  (CkP.  796).The opinion of the Committee was that should it be necessary to issue arms to persons unconnected with the Forces of the Crown, two alternatives were open, viz:-(1)    .That power should be taken to enlistloyalists into the regular Forces for a short termto tide over the  crisis,  in which case they would be drafted into existing units, or(2)      That the Special Constabulary organisation should be used,  the local Police Authorities with theassistance of the Admiralty and War Office making a selection from volunteers  of those who have been accustomed to tire use of arms-The Committee recommended the second alternative *It was explained to the Conference that theorganisation proposed in this second alternative was founded on the orgr.nisp.tion of the Specie! Constabulary&apos;but that it would be impossible to use  the men now serving in that Constabulary.    The underlying intentionwss,  that if  it was impossible  to enlist men for ashort period in the army, men who had been used to carrying arms  should be sworn in as Special Constablesand when, sworn in should be armed.    It was also stated the existing organisation of the Special
Constabulary was being extended all over the country, and efforts were being made to enlist ex-service-men as far as possible. Lists of these men could be made and kept ready for reference in case it became necessary to arm the men. Attention was also drawn to the fact that the War Office were taking steps to give effect to the recommendations made in the concluding paragraph of the Report by General Sir Nevil Macready&apos;s Committee (C.P.796), that 1,000 stand of arms should be held at each regimental depot, together with an adequate amount of small arm ammunition.

The Conference accordingly agreed:-

(1) To approve the second recommendation made by General Sir Nevil Macready&apos;s Committee, viz. that should it be necessary to issue arms to persons unconnected with the Forces of the Crown, the organisation of the special constabulary should be made use of for this, purpose;

(2) That the Home Secretary shall be responsible for giving effect to the above decision;

(3) To take note of the fact that the War Office were giving effect to the recommendation that 1,000 stand of arms should be held at each regimental depot, together with an adequate amount of small ammunition.

(2) At the request of the Minister of Transport, a discussion took place in regard of the Tramways (Temporary Increase of Charges) Bill which was down for second reading in the House of Commons the same day.

It was explained, to the Conference that the Bill gave powers to the Minister of Transport to make an Order (on the recomendation of an Advisory Committee) revising the powers of charging authorised by Orders under the Statutory Undertakings (Temporary Increase of Charges) Act, 1918, In the case of certain Tramway Undertakings, if at any time it appeared that owing to changes in the cost of labour or material, or other


other e irctunstanc e-s, the- existi.ng--oh&amp;xge^or were excessive,      The Advisory Committee in making their recommendations to the AInister of Transport would have toconsider the cost of Labour,  and the danger was that if theStatutory maximum were removed, the only restriction on thedemands pat up jointly by masters and men would be abolishedas the masters and men -would agree    to high wages, knowingvery well that the Ministry of Transport could be  forced,  toraise the charges of Tramways Undertakings in order to pay for those wages *     The particular point at issue was whethera clause should be inserted in the bill under discussion,stating that In determining the costs of labour for thepurposes of the Bill,  a certificate from the Ministry ofLabour as to the rates of wages payable, should be conclu-sive evidence-..      It was Important that some such clauseshould be inserted in the present Bill in order to make itclear that the Ministry of Labour and not the Ministry ofTransport were responsible  for fixing the rates of wages.It was explained to the Conference that the Ministryof Labour were unwilling to be placed in a position whichwould make them responsible for the rates of wages, since they had no control in the fixing of the rates, but couldonly certify what were the amounts fixed by the industrial councils as appropriate rates.Some discussion ensued as to the danger arising fromthe absence of any incentive to masters and men to keepwages down.,  and fears were expressed that the masters andmen would more and more tend to unite at the expense of thepublic,  although it was realised that in the case of manyundertakings, the economic limit had. already, been reached.The /
The Conference accordingly agreedThat the Acting Secretary ofState for the Colonies should beauthorised to Inform the NewZealand Government that in theopinion of His Majesty&apos;s GovernmentNovember 1.1th would be the mostsuitable date for the commemorationof Victory and Peace, and that theother Dominion Governments werebeing consulted in the matter.It should, however, be made clear in any communication to the DominionGovernments that this opinion didnot bind His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto the institution of an annualstatutory holiday on Armistice day.The- C^rn^orerjse-^gre-e^: -(1)    That it should he made clear--&quot;that theMinistry of Trans-port were not re-sponsJU-ble for the actual rates of wages which  )     necessitated Increased charges in thecase of any particular Undertaking, andthat with this object a clause should beinserted in the Bill stating that theevidence which the Advisory Committeewould consider as to actual rates ofwages should be furnished by the Ministryof Labour;(6)    That the actual wording of the clauseshould be settled by agreement betweenthe Minister of Transport and the Ministerof Labour.UAL OBSERV- 3.      The Conference had under consideration a memorandumE OP1ST ICE DAY. by the Acting Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP. 857)regarding a suggestion made by the New Zealand Government,that an Imperial holiday should be set aside annuallyin celebration of Victory and the conclusion of Peace.The Conference were reminded that when this question had been discussed before  (Conference of February 3rd,1920, Minute 2) the general feeling had been that theclaim of Empire Pay was less strong than that ofthe Anniversary of the Armistice.
CONGESTION OFDOCKS.(a)   IMPORTEDMEATS.4.      v&apos;ith reference to Home Affairs Committee 51 (1) ,the Conference had under consideration the following documents:-Memo: by the President, Board of Trade,(CP. 893)Memo: by Mr. McOurdy,(CP. 838)MemO: by the Shipping Controller.(CP, 881)Memo: by the Minister of Transport,(CPs 935)Memo: by the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries,(CP. 936) ,from which it appeared that the Minister of Shippingdesired to press the proposal that in order to remove the congestion of meat stocks  in the docks, the killingof home-grown meat should be stopped for a fortnightto a month, or some other definite action taken toremove the- congestion.The Ministry of Agriculture strongly demurred tothe former proposal.It vras explained to the Conference that the HomoAffairs Committee had decided on March 9th that theDepartments concerned should take all possible stepsto divert cargoes of imported meat, especially fromthe Plate, should consider the possibility of disposing of surplus supplies of imported Mutton to central europe, and should consult the Butchers&apos; association on the best means of disposing of accumulated stocks.These matters were still under consideration.The Home Affairs Committee had not been In aposition to deal finally with the matter in the absenceof further Inform?-. tion, but it had appeared to themthat no real effort had been made to see .whether themutton- could be disposed of in Central Europe.On the other hand it was stated that suppliesof mutton had been sent to Germany on private account,
i  1 owh&amp;ch were still lying in Hamburg awaiting, sale, andthe German Government appeared unwilling to take them up.    It was, moreover,  impossible, owing to the dis-location of transport conditions In Germany, to conveyany considerable quantity of meat through Germany to austria( and it would be In any event impossible to dispose of meat to the Continent except on liberal&quot;xcredit terms *Evidence was adduced to show that the GermanGovernment were aware that there was a serious congestion of meat stocks  in this country, and were deliberatelywaiting in the hope that ultimately we should be compelledto give the meat away.On the other hand,  it was stated that 20,000tons of bacon was at present occupying cold storage,and should be put into consumption at once so as tomake room for frozen meat.On behalf of the Ministry of Pood,  it was statedthat a large part of this was of inferior qualify.     Itwas proposed to dispose of  it to Germany if the sanction of the Cabinet could be obtained for sale on credit.;    Theamount of good, bacon In storage was decreasing, and bythe end of April there would be only two or three weeks&apos;supply available.The Conference agreed(1)    that it could not authorise a temporarystoppage of the killing of home-grown meatj(2)    that the Minister of Pensions be requestedto examine the question in consultationwith the Departments concerned, andto recommend to the Cabinet what steps should be taken to dispose of the surplusof bacon and mutton.The Conference had under consideration a memorandumby the Ministry of Transport (CP.904) in which it was stated that the Storage Committee(composed of representa-tives of the Admiralty, Air Ministry, Board of Trade,Ministry of Pood, Ministry of Munitions, Office of Works,Ministry of Shipping, minister^r of Transport and War Office),recommended that transit or warehouse accommodation
belonging to railway,,  dock or canal undertakings&quot; at&quot;present held by Government Departments,  should be surrendered not later than the end ox&quot; June unlessfurther occupation is agreed to by the owners of theundertaking, or, failing such agreement unless the storage Committee are satisfied after consideringall the circumstances of the case, that the extension ofthe period of possession is necessary or desirable in the national interest, and that no alternativeGovernment accommodation is available.      In reply tothe suggestion that it would be necessary to hearrepresentatives of the Mar Office and. the admiralty,who were not present,  it was pointed out that as all government Departments were represented on the StorageCommittee, the interests of those Departments would be safeguarded.It was stated that although eleven months had elapsed since the signing of the Ami slice,  the Govern-ment were still occupying one  and a half million square foot of covered commercial storage accommodationbelonging to transport undertakings,  and approximatelythree and a half millions of uncovered, storage.      Thecongest Ion of warehouses arid, docks arose directly outof the war, ana seme decision was urgently necessaryto put an end to it .The Conference agreed:-That Transit or Warehouse accommodationbelonging to Railway, Dock or Canal under-takings,  which is held by Government Depart-ments under the Defence of the Realm ( icquisi-tion of land) Act,   1916, must be surrenderednot later than the end of June, unless furtheroccupation is agreed to by tho Owners of theundertaking, or, failing such agreement, the storage Committee are satisfied, after con-sidering all the  circumstances of the case,that an extension of the period of possessionis necessary or desirable in the national interest and that no alternative Governmentaccommodation is available.
PPUBLICATION OF       5.      The Conference had before thorn a copy of aOFFICIAL HISTORYOF THf&apos;C MINISTRY letter from the Secretary of the Ministry of Munition:OF MONITIONS OFIaRs to the Secretary, Cabinet, dated the 20th March, 1920enclosing memoranda by the- Editor in charge of the historical work of the official history of theMinistry of Munitions  (0.P.957)(from which itappeared that a considerable part of the historyhas already been completed or is  in course of com-pletlon),  suggesting that the portions of the historyrecording the activities  of the Ministry in regard to industrial labour might be published for sale to thepublic, the volumes being issued as Stationery Officepub 1 i c a t ions..In response to representations that publicationof the sections in Question might lead to labourtroubles,  it was stated on behalf of the Ministry ofMunitions that -there would, be no objection to the sections being submitted to the Ministry of labour for approval, before publication^The Conferenca declded:-to authorise the publication of theLabour sections of  the History asproposed,   subject to the agreementof  the Ministry of Labour being obtained in regard to the text beforethe publication of any particulars ecu i on -.2, Whitehall Pardons,  A&apos;ALSlst March,  1920.
