fyrVlHBiMS&amp;R   (1)    With reference to Cabinet 25 (20), Conclusion 2, theCa-bdJTe^.:Jha^^^ the Shipping &apos; Cont rol-ler &quot;elating to the price of bunker coal...for-fcrreign-going vessels, and recommending that the price be lowered (paper c.p.-1180) .The general principle laid down by the Shipping Con-troller, that a British ship is entitled to the same advan-tages as ?, British facto &quot;y in the natter of coal prices, wasnot disputed.    It was pointed out, however, that it would be administratively very difficult to discriminate between homeand foreign-owned ships in the same port,  and that in theevent of such discrimination in the case of American shipswe should lay ourselves open to retaliation by the UnitedStates in their ports.    It was desirable,  on general grounds,to bring foreign ships back into British trade, as before the&quot;ar 35 per cent, of our imports were brought here in foreignbottoms.It was pointed out that there would be considerablepublic criticism if, as the result of Government action, theprice of bunker coal was reduced with no corresponding drop in the freights, the difference going into the pockets of the shipowners.The Cabinet decided  (a) To approve the proposal to reduce theprice of bunker coal bo that charged to home foe&quot;cries,  and That there shouldbe no attempt to discriminate between homeand foreign--owned vessels:(b) that in those cases whe^c freights were still under the regulation of theMinistryof Shipping, there should be made a corres-ponding&apos; decrease in the freights:(o) That in all other cases the ShippingController should endeavour to bringabout a similar - reduction in freights.
^^OLWXCH ^cessation&apos;-e^e^^ (SO),   Conclusions 1 and 2,the Cabinet had before then a Joint.Memorandum by the Ministerof Labour and the Parliamentary and Financial Secretary ofthe Ministry of Munitions, dealing with the question of dis-charges from &quot;Toolwich, in which it was urged that the pro-eosal made by the Ministry of Munitions for the establishmentof wiredrawing plant at Woolwich should be examined by theWar Office;    and that the Cabinet should,  at an early date,consider the question of withdrawing the emba cargo on themanufacture cf general articles of trade to the extent cfenabling the Government,  at Woolwich, to act as sub-contractorsto engineering firms(Paper CP.-1277).The Cabinet were reminded that the factory at Woolwichwould be transferred from the Ministry of Munitions to theWar Office on June 1st.,  and that it was the intention of theWar Office tc take over at that time only such staff as wasnecessary to the proper organisation of the factory.    It was stated, further, that the general policy of the War office would be gradually to reduce the establishment at Woolwichto normal dimensions, but it was&apos; understood that, such reduc-tion would have to be spread over a number of years, partly because of the acute housing shortage in other districts towhich workmen might desire to remove.The Cabinet were informed that the Secretary of Statefor War had invited Sir James Stevenson to overhaul theorganisation at Woolwich with a view to carrying out any necessary re f o rms.It was suggested,  in the course of the discussion,that it would be an advantage if all Government establish-ments similar to that of -oolwich were visited by a competentaccountant, who should examine the methods of accounting invogue,  in order to discover whether or not they furnishedtrue costs of production.    In connection with Woolwich it was stated that this had been done during the War.
OOTTVER- (3; The Cabinet haa b^xore  oat... a.jc1 e cy  tiie kicC^ti.TONS AT!HE. dealing with the recent Conversations at Hythe (Paner CIA,-1297) .The criticism was made that it was not clear fromthis Note that there was to be a free discussion with theGermans.    It would seem, indeed, that the intention of&apos; theAllies was to deal with the Germans almost as prisoners inCourt rather than as ex-enemies with whom peace had been concluded and who, according to all precedent, were entitledto discussion on equal terms.It was urged that without the eo-operatI.02i of theGermans the reconstruction of Europe was impossible,  andthat now Peace had been concluded it was desirable to meetthe Germans face to face with a view to advancing suchreconstruction as rapidly as possible.In reply to this criticism of what had taken place atHythe, it was pointed out that it was based on a misapproheu-sion, due possibly to the brevity of the report which hadbeen circulated..    The character of the Spa Conference *asclearly indicated in the draft Note to the German Governmentreproduced on the first page of the Secretary&apos;s Note, whereit was stated that &quot;the primary purpose of the Spa Confer-er.ee is to enable the Heads of the Allied Governments toexamine with the responsible Heads of the German GovernmentThe- Gad^ine-p --decided  -(a) To approve the ^e^oramerKixrtrixm^^hatv Wool-richshould be placed in a position to act, assub-contractors to engineering firms, subjectto Sir James Stevenson being satisfied thatthis could be done without the Governmentsuffering financial loss thereby:   &apos;(b) That Sir James Stevenson should be askedto examine the proposals of the Ministryof Munitions for the establishmont of awiredrawing plant at &apos;7oolw&apos;icht(c) That the Secretary of State for India andthe Secretary of State for the Colonies \should ascertain whether the maximum numberof orders for the Government of India andthe Crown Colonies were being placed at&quot;?oolrwiv,n
the serious questions raised by the failure of Germanyto fulfil the solemn obligations &quot; etc.    The French,on the one hand, had insisted that the Germans werenot to be invited tc Spa to revise the Treaty, but toexamine methods for carrying it out.    With this wehad agreed, but in consenting to a postponement of theConference we had equally insisted that when the Germanscame- there must be no change in the character of theConference as already agreed;    that is to say,  theremust be a face to face discussion, and in all. respects the conversations   must   be    effective    con-versations.    Similarly with reference to the discussions on frinaric-e &apos;Net-M4ydfbjg&quot;&quot;^^&apos; - the French.    The French had ashed for priority in certainclasses of reparation which did not affect the Dominionsand in which our interest was very limited.    The PrimeMinister had pointed out that this matter had been dis-cussed and settled with M. Clemenceau.    In the end, all thawas agreed upon was stated in the Comraunioud&quot; whi-oh.,had&quot;&quot;&quot;be-erissued, and the rest had been referred to the experts-, whensduty it would be to work out the problem within the terms -othe original agreement,  namely,  the proportion of  11 toFrance to  5- to the British Empire.   We had. been committed,to nothing fresh, but all were agreed that- it was necessaryin ord^r to ascertain the credit-position of the Allies-^ the experts should study simultaneously the question of inter-Allied obligations and the settlement by Germany ofher obligations to the Allies.^TEIKALLIBD (,4)    Arising&apos;&apos;0^tv-Of ^ the-NTS ANGLO-JffiHECAN XTEBTS-^ CorneeereatJLens at Hythe, the attention of the Cabinet was called to the importance of avoiding any final settlement pour liabilities to the United States independently of thesettlement of our loans to France and Italy, and the repay-ment of reparation by Germany,    It was urged that any undertakiw on our part to forgo repayment by France should be &apos;
(6 Y With, refcrenoe t o Cabd.cabinet&apos;      , (9-0) a Pcmclu ni on 6, theCabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Shipping Oontrvi-ler covering an agreement with the French Minister of Ship-ninf in regard to the ultimate,   disposal of       ex-enemy ships (Paper CP.-12-41) .The Cabinet gave their approval to theAnglo-French Agreement-.at...present provisional, and should &quot;be condJjagand^-on th*rUhitea Si^tea.^rand4j^^ In anycase- it was contended,  if we could not take this lineourselves it might be taken by *me of the neutrals,and ifthe case were properly presented to the world it was bound---to secure widespread support in the United States, at anyrate after the Presidential Election was over... .... - .   ___..-**-;-    inrtpiy to the above,  it was stated that the rrim*Minister had fuULy--considered the Paper on Inter-Allied and &quot;Anglo-Ame-rxcan Debts, which, had been circulated by theChancellor of the Exchequer (Paper CP.-1259), and did not approve the adoption at the present time of the policy recommended therein.    In these circumstances the Chancellorof the Exchequer had not proposed to trouble the Cabinetfurtlier in the matter,  but he was proceeding--with negotia-itions for meeting our demand obligations by giving the americans internet&apos;-bats-ring b-ondu payable at fixed dates.This would not necessarily prevent the United States dealing-,generously with this country later on, and the conclusionof these negotiations was desirable, because a number ofother financial readjustments depended upon it.The Cabinet were impressed with the importance ofthe issues raised by the discussion, which had arisen withoutnotice, and decided   %(a) That the Secretary should place the subject-   on the Agenda for a Cabinet Meeting to beheld before June 1st:(b) That in the meantime the Chancellor of theExchequer should interrupt the negotiations and resume them with the American repre-sentative after further consideration bythe Cabinet.
CO/JSTAZTiSTOSi^^ %Z (20),  Conclusion S,  theCabinet had before then a Joint Memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade and the Chipping Controller (paper c.P.-1199)  recommending that a Committee,   consisting ofrepresentatives of coasting shipowners and of representatives to be nominated by the Ministry of Transport,  should be ap-pointed to consider the question of exceptional railway rates and the corresponding shipping rates,  and to reportby May 15th;    and,  pending a decision in regard to theserailway rates, urging that the Coastal Subsidy Scheme shouldcontinue.The Cabinet decided  To adjourn, the consideration of thissubject untiJ   the Minister of Transportcould be present.($) The Cabinet had&quot; b^f\rr^-^tlx&amp;rs-aTTurthe ^Memorandum by-mrrhe^Shippl^ dealing with the question of theBritish share of the ex-enemy ships to be divided amongstthe Allies, and recommending that  the British Delegate onthe  Reparation Commission should be instructed to make itclear that this country will only pay for the ship^ whatthey will fetch (Paper C.P.-1S69),  it being further under-stood that all possible steps will be taken to secure thata fair price is given.The Cabinet approved the course recommendedby the Shipping Controller,  on the under-standing that the  sale of &quot;the ships wouldbe confined to British subjects.The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to instruct Sir J.ohn Bradbury accordingly.
OfBAHSR&amp;TTOH17-1     v    &apos; 135(8) The Cabinet had before them a Memorr-artd^xm^by-^^-PThiT7nin^ iC^rrt^ol drawn to the steps which were being taken by the French and italian governments to restrict the emigration       trade from the ports of those countries, to their own national vessels(Paper CP.-1285j.The Cabinet were informed that the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs had addressed Notes to the French andItalian Governments expressing surprise at the action whichthey were about to take, especially at a time when we werestraining every effort to supply them with coal, and asking for an explanation of their policy.The Cabinet approved the action of theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs,and requested Lord Curzon to eoucinueto bring pressure to bear upon the Frenchand It alian Gove &quot;nment s .IPARTHENTALEOT IAT IONSECONOMICPTIONS.(9) Irr connection- &apos;wl&apos;th..Minute 8, a Memorandum^by&quot;trie-Secretary of State for Foreign Affadjrs, . who was unable tobe present, was read,  objecting to the casual way in whicheconomic questions were dealt with between Departments,  andto the way in which Departments failed to keep the ForeignOffice informed of Conferences dealing with subjects involving-ing diplomatic considerations (See Appendix I).It was explained that the instructions to hold aConference on the supply of coal to France and italy had originated in the meetings of the Supreme Council at san Remo, at which the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs had been present.-7

APPENDIX I (See Min. 9)

Memorandum by the Foreign Office.

It is urgently necessary to draw attention to the ? to the of the pro? method of conducting negotiations on economic questions with our Allies.

Meaning that conversations were taking place between the Foreign Office and tho Board of Trade on

the subject of the quantities of coal which could be sent during the next few months to France and Italy, the Ministry of Shipping on May 12th ashed tho Foreign Office urgently that no decision should be come to until there should have been an opportunity to obtain from tho French and Italian Governments an assurance

as to the treatment to be accorded to British shipping companies engaged in carrying emigrants from French and Italian ports. There is a distinct possibility of British ships being excluded, altogether from this very lucrative traffic.

On the part of the Foreign Office the opportunity was welcomed to make the coal supplies dependent on fair treatment of British shipping interests; but,before any action could, be taken, it was learnt from the newspapers of May 17th that the French and British Coal Controllers had mot at Hythe and had come to an agreement on May 15th whereby France is to receive monthly from the United Kingdom 45$ of the coal available for export!

This agreement cannot now be set aside without causing the maximum, of friction between ourselves and our Ally, and, in the meantime, a valuable lever where-by to obtain fair treatment for an Important British
finterest has beon lost.A further -result, of tlx is --agreement with tho Frenchis that It has lncreae.ee the difficulties of dealingwith the question of British coal supplies to(a) British possessions such as Egypt,(b) The smaller Allied States, such as Portugal,Brazil, GrxjCCj(c) Pieutrals, such as Switzerland, Denmark,Sweden, Spa iii $from all of which urgent clor.tande are being received atthe Foreign Office .     Tho effect o  our relations withall of the above countries and on British intereststhere, when it is known that an agreement has boon madeto send every month to one of the Allies nearly one half of our coal enports,  is incalculable.It will be recollected that this is not the first time that such a thing has occurred.In march and April last an opportunity arose overthe question of the allocation of o;c-enony tonnage to France to bring pressure to boar on the FrenchJJovernnont to stop, among other things, the aatl-Brit-ish campaign which was being ptu^suod in the french press, when, unbeknown to the Foreign Office or toIlls majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Paris, the British andFrench Shipping Controllers met and concluded an agree-nont.       Had the Foreign Office boon consulted by either of tho Departments concerned, before these twoabove-mentioned agreements were entered upon, muchbenefit would have resulted to the interests of thiscountry abroad for which the Foreign Office primarilyis resnonsib 1 c *

A secret scheme has been put forward to the L..M.I.,.War Office,  to cope with the-present state of siegein Lublin.10th May,  IS20.The two  forces of the Irish Police, viz.,  trieiUI ..0. and the D.M.P.,  have reached a state where itis absolutely necessary that a thoroughly competentofficial should  be appointee to supervise the entireorganisation,  and to recommend to the Irish Governmentsuch changes as are essential.      It has been   suggestedthat: Lieutenant-General Sir Ed ware Bulfin, K.C.B..,  0. V. 0..,who is an Irishman,, would be well qualified for this duty.     He would require but a small staff, but itis essential that he should have a first-rate intelligence&apos;officer at his disposal to collate information and form by degrees a secret service or detective branchfor the police forces in Ireland, which is now non-existent.      A selected inspector or chief inspectorfrom Scotland yard would be invaluable to him. for somemonths,  to advise on purely police matters..
