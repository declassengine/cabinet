The Cabinet reviewed the ailrujytrjum-^dx^&quot;owix^^rt^i&amp;J^ of Frankfort and &apos;other German towns, consequent upon the de spat oh by the GermanUovernment oi^Tfeichs^ehr- into the Ruhr Valley to disband&quot;Red&quot; troopstThe C4ixLrM?tr-ws3-re^r-^^ that the Supreme council was due to meet at San Remo on April 19th. to conclude theTurkish Treaty and to close the JJe^oe..Qord^v^nc-e.    It wouldbe impossible to approach the important issues to be discus-seat San Remo without any reference to the unfriendly actionof the Fr-erK^-^ove-rTmi^^^of the rest of the Allies on the question of sending troops to the Ruhr Valley.    Large questions relating to Egypt, SyriaPalestine, Cilicia, Tangier, etc., were still outstanding,and it was desirable, if possible, to dispel the cloud Jiang inover the Ruhr Valley before meeting at San Remo.    It wassuggested that this might best be done by inviting M. Millersto come to London immediately, as experience had shown thatthe French representatives at the Conference of Ministers inLondon had very restricted powers and had constantly to refer-back to Paris.    On the other hand, it was held to be unlikelythat M. Millerand would accept an invitation to come to Londcbut would probably suggest that we should stay at Parisen route for San Remo.    This would give to the world theappearance of agreement with the French Government,  and wouPcompletely fail to mark this country&apos;s sense cf the gravebreach in united action of which the French had been guilty.The first essential,  it was argued, was to present a protest to the French Government and to refuse to continue tisend a British representative to the Conference of ambassadors-^ountil a definite understanding had been reached that theFrench alone must assume entire responsibility for theirindependent action and for its results,  or they must agreeto abide by the findings of the Conference and the  supreme council.    It was pointed out that the continuance of the   .
with rawnwoHrag of detail,  had the undent red and misIraing effect of enabling its-J^^s-i^dent^ ..the French PriraeMLniater, to promulgate his own views as if they emanatedfrom the Allies.    For this reason.the Conference should bebrought to a speedy end so soon as it had completed the hungarian Treaty.    otherwise,. f^esK trouble would be  likel:to ensue, and this country might find itself committedunawares to a militarist policy to which it was in factstrongly opposed.      In this connection the view was also expressed that the various Military,  Naval and Air ControlMissions should shortly be superseded and their work dis-charged directly,  so far as we were concerned, from london in reply to a question,  the Director of MilitaryOperations stated that,  according to War Office informatio.the number of Reichswehr in the neutral zone was approxi-mately 20,000 as against 17,500 permitted.    The number of units exceeded those allowed, but these units were much below s t r e ng t h.The Cabinet decided  -(a) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should telephone immediately toLord Derby,  instructing him not to attend the Ambassadorial Conference which,it was understood from statements in the Press,. -was being summoned for. Friday morning,and informing him that a telegram fromHis Majesty&apos;s Government would followfor presentation to the French Govern-roent.(b) That a telegram should be sent that day by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to Lord&apos; Derby,   for presentation to the Frenoh Government, which, aftersum-car is ing the whole of the facts,should proceed on the following lines:-(i)  His Majesty&apos;s Government protest against the independent ac*ion ofthe French Government in sendingFrench troops into the neutral zone.    This action has been, takenby the French Government in spiteof the emphatic opposition of his majesty&apos;s ,jesty&apos;s Government and of theAllies,   as indicated both at theConference of Ambassadors in paris and at meetings of the supreme council in London.
of the Suprerse Council,  and if repeatedit &quot;iay have the 3rave st results forthe peace of Europe.(iii)  In the opinion of Hi a Majesty&apos; s Govern-ment it is  essential to preserve the unity of * he Allies in the enforcement of the Treat;/ with Germany,    In theexecution of the Treaty questions may arise o f g r e at o o mp 1 ex i 17; an d pja gni -tude,  and as time goes on no Power:aay be able to enforce the terms ofthe Treaty single-handed against ane stiscitated G eraanv.(iv) His Majesty&apos;a Government had not ruled out the despatch of troops to the neutral zone,  but had asked for a delay of a fortnight to give the German government an opportunity of allaying the unrest.. (v)  In these circumstances His Majesty&apos;3Government wish to make it clear thatif the French Government persist  intaking independent action they mustthemselves bear the whole responsibility-ity.    It was idle to hold a Conferenceof Allied Governments to discuss the enforcement of the Treaty when one party thereto took independent actionin case of disagreement.    The Ambassadors-dors Conference had been set up primarily for the purpose of settling questions arising out of the Treaty of Peace withGermany.    This fact tended to accentuatethe difficulty which confronted theBritish Government owing to the isolatedaction of Prance.    The British government consider it necessary to have a definiteunderstanding at the earliest possible moment, and in the meantime they have instructed their Ambassador, until he receives further orders,  to abstain from taking part in any discussionsarising out  of the execution of theGerman Treaty,(c) That the Secretary of State for Poreign affairs should inform the French,   Italian and BelgianAmbassadors of the action which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment proposed to take., and should ex-press to the Italian and Belgian Ambassadorsthe hope that their Governments would supportHis Majesty&apos;s Governments(d) That  Sir Eyre Crowe and Mr P, Kerr should take steps to communicate the British case to thePress through the Press Department of theForeign Office.(e) That the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should circulate,   for the guidance of theCabinet  (i) A summary of the history of the sun-pression of the Commune in France,with special reference to the parts
^       and Ge-rman^iJOJ\ s-ummary of what had in fact reeerrtly&quot;/&apos;taken place in the Ruhr Valley, withsneoial  reference to the rebellion ofthe &quot;Rede&quot;:(iii)  The facts with regard to the executionof the Bielefeld agreement, with special reference to the alleged b&quot;each of theagreement by the German Government:(iv)  The views of Lord Eilmarnock andIkr Rob ertson (Hi s Ma j e sty&apos; s Ret) re -sentatives at Berlin and&apos;Ooblen^)as to the policy which ought to befollowed by His Majesty,1 s Governmentin the circumstances which had arisen,with specie,! reference to the characterof the present German Government,  its attitude to the Treaty, to the military party,  and to the Labour Parties.,  Whitehall Garden?,  S,April 8,  192 0.
