5?D(1) With reference to -OaJbijiei^-31 ^0)^tonalu2i,on 5, theBE.      Gabljaelf^some-d Ibhed^bLi^i^sion on the subject of a levy onje c-      war- 7/ea 1th.As an indication of.the anxiety felt in banking cir-cles in regard to the proposal,&apos; it was mentioned that theGovernor of the Bank of England, though less anxious thanthe majority of the bankers,  had gone so far as to suggestas an alternative the adoption of a forced loan which shouldproduce  750,000,000 in return for a security to individualsthe present value of which would be  251,300, 00C,  - a proposal which the Cabinet were not advised to consider,  particularly on the ground of the dangerous precedent which would thereby be created.The greater part of the discussion which ensued was devoted to the case against the tax, the arguments in favourof which had been fully stated at the previous meeting.While there was no desire to dispute that persons whohad even maintained, much less increased,  their Income duringthe &quot;Far were very fortunate and ought to&apos;pay, and while the attraction was generally admitted of any scheme for makingprofiteers disgorge,  a number of practical reasons were givenagainst the proposal for a levy on war wealth:-    its justicewas doubtful&apos;in the only form in which it could be applied;it. would -fail to discriminate between tho skilful and unskil-ful entrepreneur,  between those who had economised duringthe war and those who had been extravagant;    by deprivingbusiness men of such rewards of industry as were deliberatelygiven to them when the Excess Profits Duty was decided on;the incentive to enterprise would be greatly discouraged;in such fluctuating tines as the present there would be great difficulty in discovering an accurate basis for the valuation of post-war wealth, and during the years over which the tax was- being collected the basis would in very many instances change;    the sen.se of security &quot;would be veryinjuriously affected,  and would weigh heavily on business
organisations Vhich,  in the vast majority of cases, tradedon a working eapital-^uch-of&quot;Vhiclr-wras -nbtained as requiredby advances from the banks;    if this tax were imposed, the credit of most firms with the banks would be depreciated,and,  owing to the general uncertainty as to the value ofthe borrower&apos;c securities, the banks would certainly restrict the facilities which they normally extend to their creditors.Instances were given of the extraordinary hardship whichwould be inflicted on firms which had expanded to largedimensions in order to take up, at the request of theGovernment,  special forms of war work for patriotic reasons,many of whom were now losing the profits they had made during the War.    Further, there would be no certainty thatthis was the one and only  levy to be imposed.    It was recalled that the original proposal of the Board of InlandRevenue had been for a tax of  1,000,000,000.    No assurancegiven by the Chancellor of the Exchequer would convince thebusiness world that this was not a mere beginning, and thosewho supported the tax would insist on regarding it as aninstalment and would be continually pressing  for its repetitive-tion.    Thus the sense of insecurity, which was exertingso deplorable an effect on trade at the present moment,would be perpetuated.As regards the probable results to be obtained fromthe levy, it was pointed out that the amounts received wouldbe reduced by the general depression of business which itwould induce;    in fact, it would cause a gigantic dislocation-tion of business without producing financial advantages inany way  commensurate with the disturbance.    And this would happen just when trade was beginning to sag and when it was most necessary for us to.&quot; open up new markets abroad.On the political aspects of the question it waspointed out that, although it was not one on which opinion was divided on strictly Party lines, nevertheless, broadly speaking, the Government,  if it adopted the tax, would
^^aT&quot;&quot;^^ among thei&quot; principalsupporters and those cn whcra tho peTmsaneurb^^ pros-pority of this country largely depended, without givingsatisfaction to their opponents.    Such outcry as would beraised by the rejection of the tax could be net by givingwidespread publicity to the immense-levies which had beenmade on the richer olasoecby the operation of the ExcessProfits fax and other taxes;    the taxation of wealth in thiscountry far exceeded that imposed in any other country inthe world, and was on a scale never before attempted.    Theboldness and success of this policy ought to receive the widest publicity.The choice before the Cabinet was admitted to be analternative of evils.    If the levy on war wealth was spento great objection,  the only alternative yet suggested wasthe continuance of the Excess Profits Duty at a high rate.This tax wan also open to very grave objections,   owing tothe way in which it encouraged waste and idleness and reduced the incentive to work.   All the evidence before the Cabinetshowed the opinion of the business world throughout GreatBritain to be unanimous against the tax5 and it was statedthat this view was shared by the land-owning classes.The Cabinet agreed that the objection felt in thebusiness wo*\Ld to the tax, while it had to be given its dueweight, could not be regarded as a final and conclusive argu-merit against its imposition.    Such protests were always made when a new tax was threatened, and prepheci03 of completedisaster had been falsified.    The decision turned mainly uponwhether the levy would produce financial and psychologicaladvantages commensurate with the objections.    It was not clear that the tax would in fact yield even the  500,000,000contemplated after io had passed through the House of Commonsnor that the Government, by adopting it, fould be enabled to reduce the Income Tax appreciably or at  all.    With a
agreedNot to adopt the proposal for a levy on war weal th.(Tivf__.sg.prfttarv of State for ?7ar aske/d.that his dissent from this decrsionshould be ?ee.o?j^EE7)to the taxpayers,  but the Select Committee had not agreedto recommend a levy of  5C0,COO,000,  let alone  1,000,000,000.With regard to the psychological argument, it wasdoubtless true that the working and professional classesex-service menand thev were eager to aee the profiteers drasticallydealt with,  but  it was ve my doubtful whether this feelingwould be substantially allayed when it was realised thatthe  5CC,0C0,00D would have to be reduced by exceptions and concessions, and its payment spread over several years andaccompanied by a reduction of SO per cent, in the ExcessProfits  Duty,    The Government would be charged with camcuflag-ing the issue,  and new demands for much more drastic treat-ment would arise.    The proper remedy for this discontent was,as already suggested, a much fuller exposition of what theGovernment had in fact done.    The only justification,  it was urged,  for the existence of the present form of Government-was that it attempted to hold the balance evenly and fairlybetween all classes of the community.    The Government mustshow that they were not in the hands of the working classes,nor tied to the protection of the capitalists.    Just as inits  Russian policy the Government had fearlessly, and on anindependent **evis-* of the question on. its merits, adopted apolicy which was generally acceptable to the working classes,so, in the question now under discussion, they should not hesitate to adopt the policy favoured by the commercial interests.On a review of the above considerations,  the Cabinet
L3 OB (2) Witd reference to Cabine-t -.11 . (.20 K^ApnendJLx IT (1),and Cabinet 13 (20) Appendix I (4),  the Cabinet had before them    the draft of a Bill to regulate the number of hours of employment, together with a covering Memorandum.by the Minister of Labour (paper C.P..-1318).n of The Cabinet were reminded that the question ofjgrl culture.including agricultural labour within the provisions ofthe Bill had been left for decision to the Minister ofLabour, the Minister of Agriculture, and the Secretaryfor Scotland, but as no agreement had been reached owingto the strong opposition of the Minister of Agricultureit was now referred bach to the Cabinet.      It was statedthat the majority of Members of Parliament for agricul-tural constituencies were in favour of the Bill, but thatthere was some difference in the attitude of the agricul-tural labourers in different parts of the country.      InScotland opinion was generally in favour of the inclusionof agriculture,  and,in fact,  the arrangements proposedin the Bill were,  in manj? parts of Scotland, already inoperation.      The reel question at issue between the farmers and the labourers was the payment for over-timefor the two hours between the 50 working hours that hadbeen agreed upon by the Agricultural Wages Board, and the48 hours which it was proposed to mske statutory.After further discussion, the Cabinet agreed --That the Clause making special provisions for Agriculture should stand part of theBill.&quot;ilwaymen With regard to the relation of railwaymen to thend theshinsvton       Bill., it was explained that there were already in forceMentionagreements with the railwaymen, reached as the result of negotiations in which the Government took part, whichwere inconsistent with those of the Washington convention in certain particulars.    The representatives of the twoEailweymenTs Unions ask     that railways shall be excludedfrom the Bill, the Railway Managers also desire exclusion
