(1) With reference to 7ar Cabinet 633/the Cabinet had.&quot;before-them the draft of a Dill to amend.. JJi^r-orri Ja^dix^ixn,Act,  1917,  and..Agri.ourtau^.^ldi-ngs-Act, together with covering Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and ?tsh-eriea (Paper CP.-883)  and a Note by the Minister of Agraou.:.,-tu-o and Fisheries covering explanatory Notes on the clauses of the Agriculture Bill (Paper CP.-1178) .It was explained that the Bill had been drafted togive effect  (so far as  legislation was required)  to theRecommendations of the Selborne Committee and the recentRoyal Commission,  and to the Agricultural Policy announced by the Prime Minister in a speech at the Caxton Hall enOctober 21,   1919,  and        subsequently modified as the resultof numerous Conferences which had taken place between thePrime Minister,  the Minister of Agriculture,  and the various interests concerned.    The modifications to which the PrimeMinister had agreed, had special reference to Part II of theBill, which deals with land tenure.    In effect, the Pr-.noMinister had agreed to substituting security of capital t&apos;ofixity of tenure and dual ownership,    The draft 3:111 was,in essence,  an Amending Bill, which sought to make powmmoemtthe policy embodied in the Corn Production Aab, 19-17, It had.two ma in objects:-(i) To stimulate the production of cerealsby means of guaranteed minimum prices,accompanied by a measure of control  of cultivation much lees drastic than thatin vogue during the P.&apos;ar:(ii) To give to&apos; the farmers a sense of security against the loss of capital put it it o theirholdings in case of the be:&apos;.ng requiredto surrender the holdings       The x-aght ofthe landlord to gv/e notice to cat v. wasretained, but sub.ie-.jt to the .irov:-.-j m-nof com pens at ion for disturbance   .:i allcases where a tenant is not in default.The broad justification for the Bill lay in the seriousoutlook for the supply of breads tuffs from overseas., andalso in the new demands which were being advanced by agricultural labourers for higher wages.    It was pointed cat thatcur cheapest source of wheat supply, vim,  in Australia,Was disappearing, and there was &quot;he probability that ilu:
A.r^entin?&apos;-w^ m    .i7e  should therefore be thrown back an the more-expeT^iv^.j:Jo^h-Ainerlearr&apos;&apos;Markets and on our home crop.    The pressure of the labourersfor higher wages,  in sympathy with the industrial trades,would be accompanied by a demand from the consumers for lowerfood prices.    The resulting uncertainty bred lack of confi-dence in the farmers,  and led them to play for safety bylaying down land to grass.    It was vital for the State thatthe farmer should increase his arable culture, and,inasmuch as lie could not be compelled to do this, the only method leftwas to induce him to follow this course by assuring him of areasonable profit and guaranteeing him against disastrouslosses.    With regagd to the Parliamentary prospects of theBill,  it was explained that, in view of the prolonged negotis,-tions which had already taken place and the large measure ofagreement on principle which had been secured, no insuperable difficulties we&quot;e anticipated in the Rouse of Commons;    ande&quot;en in the Rouse of Lords, where there would undoubtedly beopposition to details of the Pill,  it was believed that thecourse of the Pill would not be endangered.    It was urgently necessary that the Pill should be introduced and printed atthe earliest possible moment,  so that it might be taken imme--diately after the Whit sun Recess, as pledges in this sensehad been riven.In the course of the discussion it was recognised thatthe Bill was a compromise which would not completely satisfythose who in the past had been the protagonists of opposingschools of land policy.    On the other hand,  it was theresult of a genuine attempt at accommodation, and would command the support of a large body of &quot;moderate opinion inall Parties.Considerable anxiety was expressed as to the ability ofthe Government to maintain high guaranteed prices in thehome market in the event of a slump in the world price of
cereals;    and it was argued, further, that the Glauses inPart.  IT of the Bill we^e unnecessary,  inasmuch as the tenanthas at present adequate machinery fo&quot; obtaining compensationfor any improvements genuinely attributable to him.    It wasalso pointed out that,  inasmuch as the basis of the guaranteed price was the cost of production,  and the largest singleelement in the cost of production was labour, the state would in effect be guaranteeing the farmer whatever wages hecared to undertake to pay,  and once more we should witnesswages and prices chasing each other in a vicious circle.   ,Itwas true that the wages v/ere settled by an Agricultural PragesBoard, who had to take, into account all the factors in thesituation;    but it was hard to see how they could withstand.the pressure to which they would be subjected.In reply to a question as to the necessity for giving solong a notice as four years for the termination of the period(Clause 1 (i)   ),    .of the guaranteed minimus/, it was explained that this was inevitable if the farmers lack of confidence was to beo^rp.noone.AP+or further discussion, the Cabinet decided  (a) To request the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries to confer with the Lord Privy Seal,the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Sir laming worthington Evans with a view to -drafting, ifpossible,  an amendment.of Clause 4, the object   -of which should be to safeguard the Stateagainst an indefinit e&apos;rise in wages following on and causing a further rise in prices and again in wages.It was suggested that this might be done bycorrelating the guaranteed-home price withthe wo&quot;d4 price of cereals.(b) To authorise the Parliamentary Secretary tothe Ministrv of Agriculture and fisheries to introduce the Bill in the House of commons at the earliest opportunity.-3-&quot;NOTE:- The First Lord of the Admiralty wishesit recorded that, while he was umbleto agree that the Bill was desirable or right, he did not intend to presshis opposition.&quot;
co^^nw-      (3) -n+h- -efe-ence to Cabinet 13 (20), Conclusion 4, and$7 weCabinet 17 (20), Conclusion 1,  the. Cabinet, had a short discussion with regard to the disposal of the surplus whichhad accrued under the Egyptian Cotton Control Scheme.The Cabinet decided  Tc adjourn the consideration of thisq u e s t i u n unt i 1 t he S e c r e t a ry of St a t efor the Colonies could be present.W Wlth wrf^rtiio^to^tJie-aTOirton. or-tDe-Buprra CouncilVt&quot;San-Pemo on April 26,  1920 (Paper I.C.P.-109, Minute &quot;   9),the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum embodying the instruer-tions of the Permanent Committee of the Supreme Economic ,Council on the Resumption of- Trade with Russia,  togetherwith a copy of the telegram for communication to M. Krassin(Paee^ CP.-1189).It was pointed out that, while on commercial grounds itwas desirable to resume trade with Russia,  negotiationswith Russian representatives were about to begin in London,and it was therefore inopportune to make the announcementproposed by the Board of Trade.    It would be preferable to make the announcement at the end of the negotiations and after due notice had been given to the Allied Govern-ments.    Further, it was important, to bear in mind thatour trade relations should embrace not only the starvingnorthern districts of Russia, but the richer food-producingareas, like the Ukraine.The Cabinet decided  go adjourn the consideration of thissubiect pending the result of thenegotiations with the Russian dele-eat es .
I 124&apos;y&amp;3ttK-     (4) srath^e-fe^^p V^-tiw-Ca-binat had before thera the fallowing documents a Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (Paper 0.P.-1&amp;43),A Memorandum by the Chairman, &quot;/heatCommission (paper CP.-1268)fA Memorandum by the Pood Controller(Paper CP.-1273).The Chancellor of the KKaheguer^ in his Memorandum,pointed out that tho improvement in the New York Exohangehad been more than swallowed up by the rise in wheat prices^from which it would appear that the world price of wheat isa sterling price and that the dollar price is merely a con-version of that sterling price into dollars at the Exchangeof the day.   The result would probably be that, in order tomaintain the present price of bread,, a subsidy of  606000,000might be required instead of the  45e000,000 provided in theEstimates for the present financial year,,   The proper course,therefore, would be to raise the price of the loaf by 5jd*,and possibly to couple this with an increased extraction of flour.To this course it was objected that only a few weeks agoa change had been made in the price of flour in order toreduce the subsidy, and this decision had involved a very complicated procedure in order to prevent the bakers makinga profit of several millions on the stocks which they had inhand.   To repeat this process after such a short intervalwould greatly disturb the trade and cause widespread dia-satisfaction.    It was suggested,  therefore, that an equallyeffective method would be to raise the price in Septembernext by a figure sufficient to meet the conditions in theautumn and to cover the abnormal losses incurred between now and then.The Cabinet were informed that the recent rise in the -rate of extraction from 76 to 80 was being m6t toy       argan-ised protests and petitions from all parts of the country,but the Ministry of Pood and the wheat Commission were convinced that, in view of the grave crisis in regard to
overseas supplies, an increased extraction would almost certainly become immediately necessary as a measure of economy.

The Cabinet decided:-

(a) That the price of the loaf should be reviewed in the autumn in the light of the conditions that obtaining,  and that the price fixed should be such as would prevent the subsidy exceeding £13,000,000:

(b) That immediately circumstances made a change in extraction desirable, Cabinet sanction for this change should be sought:

(c) That, in the event of such sanction being given, the Ministry of Food should, in publishing the alteration, take steps to impress upon the public the critical nature of the situation due to the world shortage of supplies and  the importance from the world point of view of economising the use of flour to the utmost.

BUILDING PROGRAMME FOR GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS.

(5) With reference to Cabinet 25 (20),  Conclusion 7, the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by Sir Laming Worthington-Evans asking that the reference to the committee set up to review the Building Programme of Government Departments should be extended to include building by the Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry  (Paper C.P. -1287).

The Cabinet gave their approval to the proposal to extend the reference so as to cover the Admiralty, War Office and Air  Ministry.


Cabinet 28/20, Conclusion 4 (a). -   -It has been agreed to Interpret this conclusion in the sense that the wholesale price of flour fixed should be such as would prevent the subsidy exceeding 45 millions.    (See RegisteredPile 29/A/63.) :9.6.20.
???

(6) The attention of the Cabinet was called on grounds of urgency to a request which had been received from representatives of the Church of Scotland and the United Free Church that the Government should take charge of a Bill preparing the way for a possible union of these Churches by a revision of  the statutory constitution of the Church of Scotland.

The matter was urgent as the Assembly was meeting that day in Edinburgh. It was stated that practically all the Members of Parliament for Scotland were in favour of the measure and that the Secretary for Scotland thought that at least the Government should give facilities for the Bill.

The Cabinet decided to approve the following Question and Answer:-

Question:  To ask the Prime Minister whether the Government has reached any conclusion with regard to the request signed by a very large number of Scottish Members and addressed to him to the effect that the Government should introduce a measure recognising the draft Articles prepared by the Church of Scotland as a basis of Union.

Answer: Yes, Sir. The Government have carefully considered the request and they have also received intimation of an agreement between representatives of the Church of Scotland and the United Free Church to the same effect.  The Government accordingly hope either to introduce or to give facilities for a measure in the direction indicated without avoidable delay.

WAR WEALTH LEVY.

Q (7)The Cabinet took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer desired an early discussion of the question of a levy on War Wealth.
