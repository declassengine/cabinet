-ADEN&quot;.(previous reference:Cabinet 30(28), Con-clusion 9.)1. The Secretary of State for the colonies reported to the Cabinet what had occurred inregard to the negotiations with the Imam arisingout of the decision of the Cabinet on May 23rd.The latest information showed that the Imam wasnot disposed to agree to the conditions adoptedby the Cabinet on the recommendation of theCommittee of Imperial Defence, namely,  theimmediate evacuation of Dhala as an earnest ofgood faith.At the request of the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies and the Secretary of State forAir, the Cabinet agreed  (a) To adhere to the policy decided- onMay 23rd, referred to in the margin, and that if the Imam refusedto evacuate Dhala on the expiration of the time-limit the Air force would first drop warnings, and, ifthese were disregarded, would recommencebombing:(b) That in informing the Resident at aden of this decision the Secretaryof State for the Colonies should state,in response to the former&apos;s telegraphicinquiry,  that the immediate object in view was the evacuation of the town ofDhala, in accordance with the previousultimatum, and not of the whole of the protectorate.
2. The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs on the subject of Reduction of ArmamentsA Memorandum referring specifically to a conversation Sir austen chamberlain had had with Herr vonSchubert, of the German ForeignOffice (Paper CP.-183 (28)), inwhich,  after disclaiming any ideaof using language in the natureof a threat, Herr von Schuberthad pointed out that failure tomake some advance ih disarmamentshortly would make it impossiblefor the German Govern-ent to resist the conviction which was forming inGermany that the whole pretence ofdisaraament was a sham, and thatthe opening words of the clause in the Treaty of Versailles whichimposes disarmament on Germanymean nothing and that the basisof the restrictions imposed upon germany was gone.A Memorandum of a conversationwith M. Paul Boneour (Paper C.P.-18^- (28)).While taking note of the views of theForeign Secretary, the Cabinet felt that theycould not really make any progress on this important question in Sir Austen Chamberlainsabsence.   The suggestion was made that the real question before the Cabinet was as to whether anend should be put to the proceedings of theDisarmament Commission.    The last adjournmenthad been agreed upon to enable Great Britain andFrance to reach some agreement..    As M. PaulBoncour had observed to Sir Austen Chamberlain(Paper CP.-184 (28)), it was useless for theDisarmament Commission to meet again unlessGreat Britain and France had previously reached agreement.   The position had reached the stage that any further proposal for postponement was likely.to be received with derision.
The Cabinet agreed  That the Government * s policy In response sard to Disarmament should beconsidered either at their next meeting or at a Meeting in thecoming week, and took note -(a) That the Prime Minister intendedto send the same afternoon atelegram to Sir austen chamberlain asking him, inview of Lord Cushendun&apos;s earlydeparture for a Meeting of theSecurity Committee at Geneva,to return in time for a special meeting of the Cabinet to beheld not later than Thursday,June 21st, or preferably e^-enon Wednesday. June 20th:(b) That the Chancellor       the duchy of Lancaster would circulate Papers in regard tothe position:(c) That the Lord Privy Seal,  as chairman of the Cabinet Com-mittee, would probably cireu-late a Memorandum:(d) That the Secretary of State forWar intended to circulate an appreciation of the effect ofrecent changes in the french army.

CHINA.Powers and authority ofthe NavalCommanderin-Chief.(previous reference cabinet 31(28), Con-clusion 3.)4. The Cabinet had before them a Note ty theFirst Sea Lord of the Admiralty (Paper CP.-181 (.28))circulated in the absence of the First Lord,setting forth the powers and authority delegated to Admiral Sir Reginald Tyrwhitt, the Na^alCommander-in-Chief in China.The Cabinet decided that they ought  toha-^e the observations of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs before talcing formal note ofthe First Sea Lord&apos;s Paper,  and the PrimeMinister instructed the Secretary to submit thematter to him for the Agenda Paper for the nextweekly Meeting.
THE EXPORT OPAERONAUTICALMATERIAL TORUSSIA.(previous refer enoe:Cabinet 63(27), Con-clusion 13.)5.   The Secretary of State for Air raised as a matter of -urgency the question of whetherauthority could be given to Messrs Vickers to quote for the export of certain aircraft to Russia.He recalled that on December 21, 1927, the Cabinet-had decided not to permit Messrs Vickers to accept an order from Russia for certain aeroplanes for civilian use.   The reasons for refusing the order had been, first, that the said aeroplanes wereconvertible into bombers, and, second, that thebona fides of the order were uncertain.   MessrsVickers had now renewed their request.   The new factors in the case were that progress had now beenmade by the Air Ministry which rendered obsolescentthe machines which Russia desired.   Moreover, thequestion had been carefully examined,  and it hadbeen ascertained that the range of these craft-was so limited that they did not constitute a danger.   In addition,  the Board       Trade were nowsatisfied that the order was bona fide.   TheSecretary of State  for Foreign Affairs, the Boardof Trade and the War Office were all agreed that from the point of view of defence there was noobjection &quot;to sanctioning this order.The Cabinet authorised the Secretaryof State for Air to permit MessrsViekers to  accept the Russian order for the aeroplanes referred to above..
6 . The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum,by the Home Secretary (Paper CP.-182 (28)) onthe Liquor(Disinterested Ownership and Management)Bill, introduced in the House of Lords by lord balfour of Burleigh, which was due for SecondHeading on June 20th.    The two main principlesinvolved in the Bill were, first, that, givencertain conditions,  there should be substituted system of public ownership and management inthe liquor trade for the present system of privateenterprise:    second, that the question whether such substitution should or should not be made should be left to be determined locally by a poll.In this Memorandum the Home Secretary reportedthat, whatever the merits or demerits of theprinciples iroo lved, the Bill was not good as a workable proposition, and probably not susceptibleof satisfactory amendment.   Sir William Joynson-Hicks suggested that opposition to the Bill shouldbe coupled .,rith specific assurances regarding thecontinuance of existing schemes for disinterestedownership and management of public-houses.After a short discussion the Cabinet agreed -(a) That the representative of theGovernment in the House of lords should oppose the Bill referredto in the Home secretary Memo-randum on merits and without making any declaration on thequestion of Government policy onthe subject of disinterestedmanagement:(b) That the Lord Privy Seal should arrange with the Home secretary as to which Minister would speakfor the Government on the&apos;subject.
