THE UNITEDSTATES of America..THE MULTI-LATERALTREATY .(previous reference:Cabinet 30(28)    Con-clusion 3.)1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that he had receivedMr KeIloggTs further eommunioatiOn covering the revised Multilateral Pact, which was nowbeing examined in the Foreign Office,   before making any proposals to the Cabinet he wishedto receive a Report on the subject from SirCecil Hurst, who was at present -at Geneva with lord Cushendun, where he would have the opportunity-nity to exchange views with the French andGerman Legal Advisers, M, Fromageot and Herr.Gauss,   The situation was not without consider-able difficulties, partly owing to the fact thatthe American Secretary of State had not gone very far to meet the criticisms of the original draft.,and partly owing to the desire of some of theDominions to accept the draft without furthercomment.   Sir Austen Chamberlain asked theCabinet to give him a little time to obtainreports from the Foreign Office.
THE USE OP 2. The Oabinet had before them a Memorandum by air POWER.the Secretary of State for Air (Paper 0 .P.-160 (28))(Previous covering an Air Staff Memorandum on the use ofReference:Oabinet 30 air power as illustrated by the recent operations(28).  Con-clusion 4.) in Arabia.   The Conclusions  and recommendations in the Air Staff Paper, which was signed byTHE PERSIAN Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir Hugh Trenchard.GULF SUE- &apos;COMMITTEE, are as follows f-Extension of (a) In view of the fact that air power&quot;Reference. achieves success by its effect on. the moral of an enemy, it is(Previous essential that the local politicalReference: authority and the Air Officer Com-?fp^nP^ manding should act together in the(28), C/on- closest co-operation.   Although itelusion ia the duty of the political authority to determine when air action is necessary, it shouldbe the duty of the Air officer to say when air operations shouldbe suspended and when peacenegotiations should be commenced.(b) Accurate and timely information is essential to the success of airpower.   Reorganisation of the intelligence services in Trans Jordan,Iraq and Aden appears necessarysand additional European personnelcapable of speaking the locallanguages are required in thosecountries both in the Air Forceand in the Political Departments.(c) Local political authorities shouldbe given wider discretionary powersso that they can make decisionswithout constant reference to theDepartments of State at home.(d) The responsibilities of the ColonialOffice should be extended to includeKowoit, the Trucial Chiefs and all political questions concerning thecountries contiguoiis with Arabia.(e) Would it not be possible to make one department of the Government, withthe Air Ministry as advisers on airmatters, responsible for politicaland administrative action in Arabia,or at any rate in Iraq, Aden andTr ansjordan?    Even if this solution is impracticable, has not the timecome when the India Office and government of India might well considerrelieving themselves of their directpolitical and administrativeresponsibilities connected with Arabia?
The Secretary of State for Air grade astatement to the Cabinet in the course of whichhe emphasized the great importance of the speed of aircraft, which, by enabling them to act withgreat promptitude, rendered possible the main-tenance of order in countries in the Middle Eastwith very small forces.   To utilise the Air armto its full effect, however, the speed of aircraftrequired as a corollary a speed in politicalaction to follow up Air action (the effect ofwhich was apt to wear off rather rapidly) andspeed in taking political decisions at home.He pave instances of how air action had failedin its full results from defective liaisonlocally and slow action at horr e.In the course of the discussion the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, while expressinggeneral agreement in the desirability of improving the machinery of government in such a way as toensure prompter decisions,  entered a caveat thatthe Foreign Office must continue to be fullyconsulted in regard to air action which might inany way react upon foreign relations.The Cabinet agreed  That the reference to the Sub-Committeeof the Committee of Imperial Defenceappointed to consider our policy inthe Persian Gulf should be extendedso as to cover the questions raised in the Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Air and its enclosures(Pap-r C.P.-160 (28)) .
THE UNEMPLOY-JSBNT SITUATION(previous reference:Cabinet 34(28), Con-elusion 10.)THE INDUSTRIALTRANSFERENCEBOARD.(previous reference e:Cabinet 16(28), Con-clusion 9.)3 . The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Minister of Labour (Paper CP.-188 (28))bringing to their notice the unsatisfactory-trend of unemployment figures in the last fewweeks,  and pointing out that the general effectof these figures, which are largely influenced by the distribution of the coal, cotton and ironand steel industries, is that the districts witha relatively low percentage of unemployment arelittle worse off or (in the case of London) are actually better;   while the districts with heavyunemployment,  and partieularly Wales and theNorthern Counties of England, have becomedefinitely worse.The Minister of Labour amplified his memorandum by a statement, at the end of which he proposed that, subject perhaps to the desirabilityof awaiting the Report of the Industrial Transfer-once Board, a Cabinet Committee might be appointedto analyse and appreciate the data in regard tothe serious unemployment situation and to recommend to the Cabinet measures to be taken to meet the difficult situation likely to develop during thewinter.The President of the Board of. Trade made astatement in regard to the serious setback in trade which had begun at the commencement of the&quot;second Quarter of the year after a most promisingfirst Quarter,  and asked that he might have theco-operation of the Treasury (Board of InlandRevenue) and the Ministry of Labour to analysethe very full reports in the possession of his department on the subject, with a view,  if possible
to ascertaining what were the causes of thepresent difficulties.The Chancellor of the Exchequer also urged the need of further inquiry on this subject, inwhich he hoped that the bearing of our currencypolicy on the question of trade and employment would not be overlooked.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That representatives ofThe Treasury,The Board of Trade,The Ministry of Labour,and, if necessary,The Ministry of Health,should meet to examine the positionof trade and unemployment with aview to indicating, if possible,the causes of the present setback,the areas in which it was&quot; likely toproduce the worst effects, and tomake recommendations.(N.B.    The President of the Boardof Trade nominated Sir HoraceP. Hamilton,  K.C.B., thePermanent Secretary of theBoard of Trade, and Sir SydneyChapman, K.C.B..,G.B.E., ChiefEconomic Adviser to HisMajesty&apos;s Government, as thnBoard of Trade representatives on this Committee.)(b) That, without awaiting the Report ofthe above Inquiry, the Report of theIndustrial Transference Board should come before the Cabinet at theirregular Meeting in the following week,with a view to a resumption of thediscussion on Unemployment, and thatin the meanwhile the appointment ofa Cabinet Committee should be post-poned.
SCHEME op RATING        4.The Cabinet had before them a MemorandumRELIEF.  &apos; by the Secretary of State for Scotland (PaperScotland.C.P.-201 (28)) containing a description of the(Previous principal proposals to be embodied in a MemorandumReference:Cabinet 34 on Local Government changes in Scotland consequent(28), Con-clusion 3.) upon the Scheme of Rating Relief, which he hoped to aubmit in draft early next week.    It was mentioned that new money required to meet the grants payable under the formula in Scotland would amount to  750,000.The draft Memorandum referred to in theSecretary of State&apos;s Memorandum was circulated onthe evening before the Meeting for attachment to paper CP.-201 (28).The Secretary of State for Scotland made astatement to the Cabinet in which, inter alia, he called attention to the following points:-That a concession might possibly haveto be made in order to secure that agricultural subjects should be ratedon one-eighth of the gross annual value instead of one-sixth as statedin paragraph 2 of the draft Memorandum:&quot;That some difficulty might arise owingto the suppression of the existing LocalEducation Authorities:That the figures at the end of thedraft White Paper would, in the finalprint, be brought into harmony withthe figures in the Minister of Health&apos;sMemorandum:That there were some districts, in glasgow, for example, where it wasimpossible to equalise the loss without some financial assistance.The Chancellor- of the Exchequer, recognising that both in England and in Scotland there were some places where the loss could not be equalised, saidthat if the two Ministers concerned could devise   ascheme which would enable an announcement to be made
th3t no Local Authority would be worse off,which was nOt unduly costly, he would give it hismost careful consideration.
5 . The Cabinet had before there a Memorandumby the First Commissioner of Works (paper CPs-SOS (28)) covering a dra^t of a Bill to transfer to the Westminster City Council the roads andpavements in Parliament Square.The Prime Minister entered a oayeat thatthe time of Parliament during the present Sessionwas very much taken up and he doubted if it wouldbe possible to give any facilities to the Parlia-ment Square and Other Streets Bill,The Cabinet agreed, subject-to the PrimeMinister&apos;s warning, -To approve the Parliament Squareand Other Streets Bill, and thatthe First Commissioner of works should place himself in touchwith the Chief Whip in order toascertain whether some opportunitycould be found to pass what was likely to be an uncontroversialmeasure.
THE SHOPS(HOURS OPCLOSING)BILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 12(28),  Con-clusion 17.)6. The Cabinet had before them the Shops(Hours of Closing) Bill,  introduced by a private member, to come up for Report and Third reading in the House of Commons on Friday, June 29th.No comment was made on this Bill,

Itwas stated in Lord Birkenhead&apos;note that he was in consultationwith Sir John Simon in regard tothe question of abrogating the reservation made by the Chairmano f the Commission in his publishedletter of the 6th February on theright to take evidence in cameraif necessary.The Cabinet took note of the abovePapers .

The Cabinet were informed that, in spiteof TTvuch deliberate obstruction, the racecourse betting Bill was likely to emerge from GrandCommittee almost at once.   A very large number of amendments had been introduced to meet the viewsof the Treasury and the Home Office,  and it was urged that the Government were bound to give facilities for the passage of the Bill and even to put on the Whips .   This course was also urgedas desirable from a Treasury point of view inorder to render it possible to deal next year with the present evasion of the Betting Tax.The Cabinet agreed  That, subject to it being found possible to obtain the necessaryParliamentary time,  facilities should be given for the passageof the Racecourse Betting Bill,and the Whips should be put on.The Prime Minister undertook todiscuss this matter with the chief whip,  and he was asked also not to overlook the great importance ofthe Administration of Justice bill and the Dog Racing Bill....2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,June 27$ 1928,
