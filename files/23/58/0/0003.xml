2.The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to a proposal made by the zionist Organisation that Great Britain should join with such Powers as are willing to co-operate in guaranteeing a Loan of the order of magnitude of  2,000,000, repayable in about 40 years, to beraised under the auspices of the League of Nations:A Memorandum by the Lord Presidentof the Council, supporting theproposal and urging that it shouldbe considered from a statesman&apos;spoint of view (Paper C.P.-71 (28)):A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies (Paper G.P.-85 (28)) covering a statement sub-mitted by the Zionist Organisation,giving details,  supporting the pro-posal and suggesting that the first step should be to ascertain whetherthe French, Italian and otherGovernments would be prepared toparticipate and support us in raising the question at Geneva:A Note by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (Paper CP.-110 (28)) covering a Paper by SirOtto Niemeyer on the subject ofthe principles on which Loans are supported by the League of Nations,who- reached    the conclusion that both the Financial Committee andthe Council of the League would find great difficulty in regardingthe Zionist case as a proper subject for their Intervention:A Memorandum by the Treasury (paper g.P.-114 (28)), circulated by theChancellor of the Exchequer, eon-curring in Sir Otto Niemeyer&apos;s view and   opposing an independent guaranteeby the British Government on financial grounds.The Prime Minister reminded the Cabinet thatthis question had been postponed, after a shortdi-scussion at a previous Meeting, until theLord President1s return.The Earl of Balfour then gave the Cabinet afull exposition of the case in favour of the pro-posals of the Zionist Organisation, and dealt withPALESTINE .ProposedZionistLoan.(previous reference:Cabinet 20(28),  Con-elusion 10.)
the various objections, in which h^ was followedby the Secretary of State for the Colonies.In the course of the discussion rranyobjections were raised against the proposals ofthe Zionist Organisation.   A number of tentativealternative suggestions were considered for assisting the Zionist Organisation to raise a loan, whether by an international guarantee, bya purely British guarantee, or by means of an investigation by the Financial organ of theLeague of Nations into the soundness of theproposal;    but each of these suggestions was found open to considerable objection.The Cabinet were also reminded that before long they were likely to be asked tc considerthe projected railway and pipeline from Baghdadto the Mediterranean, which, in the absence ofsome financial support or guarantee, were liable to be brought by the shorter route to someport in Syria instead of to Haifa, and it wassuggested that the credit of the countryought not to be pledged in support of the formof development of Palestine involved in the zionist proposal until the railway and pipelinehad been considered.    It was also pointed out thatdetails were lacking both as to the purposes towhich the proceeds of the projected Zionist Loanwere to be devoted and as to the financial results of the earlier schemes of settlement ofthe Zionist Organisation.e
After a full discussion,  the cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State forthe Colonies should be authorisedto inform Dr. Weizmann that theCabinet see very grave difficul-ties in supporting the proposalsof the Zionist Organisation, andthat, without finally rejectingthem, they could not at presentoffer them any encouragement.Mr Amery was authorised to add that the Cabinet were anxiousto do all that they could towardsthe support and development ofPalestine .
SCHEME OP 3.The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byRATING RELIEF.  the Minister of Health, circulating for the approvalProposals for reform in of the Cabinet a draft of   a   Memorandum on LocalLocal Govern-ment. Government changes involved in the scheme ofRating Relief (Paper CP.-186 (28)).   In his(previous reference:       covering Memorandum the Minister of Health drewCabinet 23(28),  Con-       attention to the following points:-elusion 4.)That the proposals involve theabolition of the Guardians andthe transference of all their functions to County and CountyBorough Councils:That the proposed transference of the responsibility for, themaintenance of scheduled toadsfrom the District Councils tothe Counties would rob the rural district Councils of the bulk oftheir present work, which theywould resist:That the formula as stated appearscomplicated, but that the LocalAuthorities would be mainly con-concerned with the effect on the grant and would concentrate on the tablesrather than on the formula:That the various adjustments pro-posed would in some cases lead toan actual increase in rate poundage;that it is proposed to give a guarantee that this shall not, in the case ofnon-County Borough and district councils, exceed 3d, in the pound;and that further?aer consideration isbeing given to the matter with aview to ascertaining whether itwould be possible to guarantee thatno loss should arise:That while the actual derating ofagriculture and industry would ocmeinto force on October 1, 1929, the block grant system would not operateuntil April 1, 1930,  and that provision was consequently beingmade for a transitional grant tocover deficiencies in the inter-vening half-year:That the tables relating to county boroughs would not take into accountchanges due to the apportionment of poor Law charges between the Boroughand other parts of an existing Unionwhere the boundaries of the UnionSubsequentlyaltered to r^ad&quot;all&quot; roads(See fo1lowingpage) .
are not co-terrjinous with, thoseof the Borough;Attention was also called to theanomalous and difficult case of west Hair,  and the proposal was made that the County Boroughs of Eastand West Ham should be converted into Metropolitan Boroughs, a subject on which the London CountyCouncil would be consulted;That the  3,000,000 originally proposed to be provided as newmoney to help the scheme throughhad grown to  7,500,000.The Minister of Health ashed the Cabinet totake note that in paragraph 3 of his coveringNote the words &quot;scheduled roads&quot; should be corrected to read &quot;all roads&quot;eAfter discussion, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That as regards the Borough and district Councils within theadministrative county, in lieu of the proposed guarantee thatin no case shall the actualincrease in rate poundage exceed3d * in the pound, a guarantee should be given that no lossshall fall upon any authority atthe initiation of the scheme:(b) That this  protection against lossshould be afforded by a temporary arrangements the cost of whichshould be shared between theExchequer and the County Councilsas might be arranged between theTreasury and the Ministry of Healthso as to suffice in the first yearto avoid an increase in ratepoundage in any district:(c) That the special grants of this nature should be gradually reduced and should finally disappear in1945 when the formula aystem isdue to cone into full operation:(d) That it was of the greatest import-ance that the Road Fund should contribute to the scheme not lessthan  3,000,0 00 a year apart fromthe amount of the existing Roadi    -     Grants which are to be incorporated in the general grant, and that the1 Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Health should confer
with the Minister of transport to this end.   The question wasonly to he referred back to theCabinet in the event of disagree-merit.   In the event of agreement the question of definitely setting out this arrangement in the Memo-randum should be discussed andsettled by those three Ministers:(e) That, subject to the above,  andsubject to agreement between theTreasury and the Minister ofHealth on any outstanding points of detail, the Memorandum attachedto Paper C.P.-186 (28) should be approved:(f) That, having regard to theParliamentary situation of the rating and Valuation Bill andto his own undertakings on thesubject, the Minister of health should consult the Chief Whipwith reference to the date of publication of the Memorandum.The Cabinet took favourablenote of the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s strongly-expresseddesire (i) that West and EastHam should be brought withinthe ambit of the London CountyCouncil; and (ii) that the period for which the block grants wereto be settled should not be reduced below five years .

The Cabinet had before them the following documents:--A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState^for, Air &quot;(Paper C.P.-108 (28))cohering&apos;a Note by the Air Staffprepared in accordance with Cabinet30 (28), Conclusion 7(b), submittinga list of frontier posts behind theIraq-Nejd frontier considered essen-tial for the defence of Iraq.   Inthis Note it was proposed that the eight posts originally considered essential should be reduced to six,of which four already exist,  andit was pointed out that there areonly three posts regarding whichIbn Saud&apos;s objections must be overcome.   The Air Staff emphasized,however, that this reduction was onthe assumption that Ibn Saud wouldtake more effective steps than hitherto to restrain his Tribesfrom raiding,  and suggested thathe should ho informed that if thereis a recurrence of raids His Majesty&apos;sGovernment must reserve the right to sanction the erection of additionalposts:A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies (Paper CP.-187 (28))opposing any further concession toIbn Saud in the matter of thefrontier posts, and covering atelegram from the High commissioner of Iraq dated May 28^despatch from the Highof Iraq dated March 29,1928,  and aCommissioner1928 .The Cabinet agreed  That the above Memoranda should bereferred to the Committee of ImperialDefence for examination and report.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,June 20, 1928.
