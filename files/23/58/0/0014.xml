PARLIAMENTARYEUSINESS.(Pr evi previous reference:Cabinet 42(28)    Con-clusion 15.)1. The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that he had received from the Parliamentary Secretaryto the Treasury a detailed statement in regard tothe time available in the forthcoming Session ofParliament, as -well as particulars as to unavoidablebusiness which had to be transacted.   The result wasto indicate that, from the point of view of the time required to carry out the Government&apos;s programme,it would be a difficult Session.   He undertook to circulate the Parliamentary secretary Memorandumbefore the next Meeting of the Cabinet, with a viewto a discussion of Government business. He particu-larly asked the Minister of Health and the Secretaryof State for Scotland to let him know before thenext Meeting of the Cabinet how much parliamentary time would be required for carrying out the RatingReform proposals.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To hold their next Meeting onMonday next, October 1st, at 3p.mc, for the principal purposeof discussing Government Eusiness:(b) That a Memorandum by the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury should be circulated for their information:(c) That the Minister of Health and theSecretary of State for Scotland should notify the Prime Minister as to theamount of Parliamentary time requiredin connection with Rating Reform Bills.

In this Memorandum the Cabinet waselusion 4 .)asked to approve, as a basis of negotiation, theterms set forth in the Appendix to this Minutein regard to (a) Post Office Staff,  (b) pacific cable Board Staff, on the understanding that itmight be found necessary, in order to reach an agreed settlement, to make some abatement from theliability which the scheme for the transfer ofthe Post Office staff would impose on the MergerCompany, but not from the scheme as affecting the pacific Cable Board staff.The Cabinet approved the proposals in the Treasury Memorandum (paper c.P.-271 (28)) .
THE persian gulf.(previous reference:Cabinet 3 5(28), Con-elusion 2.)5.   Lord Cushendun, acting for the Secretaryof State for Foreign /- ffairs, reminded the cabinet of various disagreeable incidents which had occurred in the Persian Gulf during the Recess, particulars of which had been circulated to his colleagues .He recalled that the situation in the Persian Gulfwas under consideration by a Sub-Committee of theCommittee of Imperial Defence which would meet not before October 15th.    It was possible that anattempt \vould be made to force us to arbitrationon som^e of the questions outstanding with the PersianGovernment, and he therefore felt that in due course the Cabinet itself would have to give considerationto this question.In the course of a short discussion the hopewas expressed that the Government would on no account be committed to an arbitration on Persianaffairs without previous discussion by the Cabinet.(NOTE:  In the absence of the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairsthe Prime Minister has asked the Lord Chancellor to act as chairman of the Persian GulfSub-Committee of the Committeeof Imperial Defence, and hasadded Lord Cushendun to theSub-Com mi 11 e e.)
i-fc -*-%.  .-.238ARlvlAT^ENTS - 4 . Lord Cushendun referred to  the Anglo-FrenchREDUCTION OF.  proposals for Naval Disarmament which had been,Naval Disarm-!%ient, communicated to the United States of America,(Previous Italy and Japan for their observations beforeReference:Cabinet 36 presentation to the Preparatory Commission of the(28), Con-clusion 2.) League of Nations.   He pointed out that, in viewof the leakage of an important French despatchcontaining particulars of the Anglo-French pro-posals, the question of publishing the latterbecame of some importance.   It had been ascertained that the French Foreign Office favoured immediatepublication.   A Note   possibly a disagreeableone   from the United States Government might beexpected within the next few days.   Lord Cushendunexplained that the proposals had been prepared forthe use of persons with intimate knowledge of thequestion of Naval Disarmament and would require careful editing to explain the circumstances inwhich the present position had arisen.In the course of a discussion of some lengththe Cabinet were reminded, inter alia, that the geneva Naval Disarmament Conference was alleged tohave failed owing to the lack of diplomatic pre par a-tion beforehand.   In the present instance everyeffort had been made to prepare the way for anAgreement, but the results in Air eric a had not beenfortunate.The discussion revealed a disposition among members of the Cabinet to adhere to the Anglo-french proposals as a basis for discussion, even if theywere not acceptable to the United States of America.There was general agreement also that, beforepublishing the Note, it would be advisable to await
the American reply.   A rejoinder to that replymight provide a convenient opportunity for anarrative of the events which had led up to thepresent position and for an exposition of theGovernmentTs policy.Comment was made on the unfortunate resultsof recent attempts to promote reduction and limita-tion of armaments &quot;by the method of international conference, which had sometimes resulted in ratherhitter controversy.   The suggestion was made that progress was more likely to result from the presentconditions of financial pressure and the steady increase in international security.The Cabinet agreed  That it would be advisable to await the American Note before publishing the Anglo-French proposals,  and thatit would be inadvisable for the PrimeMinister to refer to the matter inhis forthcoming speech at Yarmouth,although, if circumstances renderedthis course desirable, it might be useful for him to refer to it in alater speech, e,g,, at the Cutlers&apos;Feast at Sheffield.
GERMANY.Army of Occupationon the Rhine.(previous reference:Cabinet 49(27), Con-clusion 4).REPARATIONS.(previous reference:Cabinet 2(25),  Con-clusion 1 *)5.    Lord Cushendun referred to the conversations which had taken place at Geneva in regard to thepossible termination of the Allied occupation ofthe Rhineland as desired by Germany, full particu-lar3 of which had already been circulated to theCabinet.     He reminded his colleagues that he had agreed that British experts should take part in discussions on the question of Reparations byGermany.      In assenting to this Lord Cushendunrecalled that he had made it clear that -(i) our policy rests on the BalfourNote and that British expertscould participate in the discus-sions only on the understandingthat we expected to obtain from europe at least as much as we hadto pay to America:(ii) we could consent to no scheme whichimplied an appeal t&amp; the UnitedStates of America to release usfrum our debts.Lord Cushendun also referred te the arrangement which had been made for considering some form of^ control er observation over the demilitarised zoneafter the evacuation.The Chancellor *f the Exchequer, disagreeingwith (ii) above, stated that the policy of theBslfour Note is an implied appeal to the UnitedStates to release us from being their debtcollector in Europe.While the Cabinet realised that the discus-sions in regard to Reparations were not unlikely to result in an attempt to represent the british policy of the Balfour Note as standing in the wayof a European settlement, they fully appreciated that the British Delegation at Geneva could not possibly have resisted the proposed discussions.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.September 24th,  1928.
