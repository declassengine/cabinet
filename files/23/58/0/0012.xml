RATES OPPENSIONSof thefightingservices(previous previous reference:Cabinet 4(26), Con-clusion 4.)4. The Cabinet had before thera the Report ofthe Secretary of State for Scotland&apos;s Committeequestionon the Rates of lay of the Fighting Services on the/referred to it. by the Cabinet on the 10th February,1926, namely, the revision of the rates of service pensions  (Paper CP .-252 (28)), the recommendationsof which, as compared with the present position,are shown in the Table attached as Appendix I.The Cabinet were informed that recruitingfor the Army had been proceeding somewhat slowlythis year and had only recently begun to improve,with the result that the Army was somewhat understrength.    The announcement of a proposal forreduced pensions, even though it would not take effect for 21 years, would have a detrimental effect from a psychological point of view, more particularlycoming, as it would, immediately after the announce-ment of the stabilisation of war pensions.In these circumstances the Cabinet, whileapproving the Report of the Secretary of State forScotland&apos;s Committee (Paper C.P.-252 (28)), agreed-That the decision should not be announced until next summer.
PEC ON ST ITU TED0D SYNTHETIC5. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Health (Paper C.P.-260 (28))raising the question of the course to be adoptedwith regard to a Bill, introduced late in thepresent Session by a Private Member (Mr Everard),to control the production, distribution and saleof re-constituted and synthetic cream.    In thisMemorandum the Minister of Health gave reasons for advising that the Bill would not be of much serviceeither to the farmers or to the public   He was not disposed at this date to give any definite pledge to introduce the Bill, but proposed, subject tothe agreement of the Cabinet, to inform the promoters that consideration would be given tothe question of the introduction of a Government-Bill at a later date if Parliamentary time permits.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Minister of Health as summarised above.
ijHE OS OAR 6, The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bySLATER CASE.the Secretary of State for Scotland (Paper C.P.-265 (28)) recommending that an ex gratia paymentof  6,000 should be made to Oscar Slater, whowas convicted of murder and sentenced to deathat the High Court of Judiciary, Edinburgh, on the6th May, 1909, the sentence being commuted topenal servitude for life, who was liberated onlicence on the 14th November, 1927, having thencompleted 18-^ years&apos; imprisonment, and whoseconviction and sentence had been quashed on the20th Instant by the High Court of Judiciary onthe ground that the Judge at the trial failed to direct the Jury to put out of their minds certainevidence regarding Slater&apos;s disreputable relationswith the female members of his household.After discussion, the Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State forScotland should endeavour tosecure a settlement of thisquestion on the basis of an ex gratia payment of  5,000to Oscar Slater, but, ifnecessary, should have authorityto give up to  6,000.
THE INTER-national labour CON-PERENOE  NINTH SESSION,(previous reference:Cabinet 42(28), Con-clusion 12.)7 . The Cabinet had before their- a Memorandum bythe Minister of Labour (Paper C.P.-246 (28))containing proposals drawn up in consultation withthe Board of Trade as to the action to be takenby the Government in regard to the Draft conventions and Recommendations adopted by the InternationalLabour Conference which was held at Geneva inJune, 1925.    The proposals of the Minister ofLabour are summarised in the    Minute      of theprevious Meeting of the Cabinet referred to in the margin.The question had been adjourned at theprevious Meeting of the Cabinet in order that thePresident of the Board of Trade and the Ministerof Labour might consider, in the light of previous experience, suggestions made during the Meeting inregard to the Draft Convention concerning Seamen&apos;sArticles of Agreement, viz,, as to whether themore convenient course might not be to depart from our usual custom and to ratify subject to a reserva-tion on Article 5, or,  alternatively, that weshould enact the necessar]/&quot; legislation to carryout the Convention, omitting the point covered by article 5 of the Convention, and then notify theInternational labour Office of the course adopted.The Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministryof Labour informed the Cabinet that the question had been carefully considered in his department and the conclusion had been reached that, to breakthrough the principle hitherto adhered to of notratifying any Treaty with a reservation would bea very unfortunate course.   Other nations would
be encouraged to do the aarae, with the resultthat the whole of the Conventions drawn up &quot;atthe International Labour Office would, for all practical purposes, become useless, owing to thenumbers of reservations.   The second alternativereferred to above, the Cabinet were informed,was not applicable, as no legislation was required except in regard to Article 5 of theConvention.-The President of the Board of trade generally supported the views of the Ministryof Labour on the question of principle.In these circumstances the Cabinet agreed -(a) In regard to the Draft convention concerning Seamen&apos;s Articles ofAgreement, that the InternationalLabour Office should be informed&apos;of the objections taken by Britishshipowners and seamen to Article 5:*(b) That as regards the Draft convention concerning the Repatriation of Seamen,His Majesty&apos;s Government should intimate that it is prepared to ratify the Draft Convention as soonas at least six of the other principalMaritime Powers are also prepared to ratify:(c) In regard to the recommendationconcerning the Repatriation ofMa s ters and A percent ent ices,&apos; theSecretary-General of the League ofNations should be informed thatthe question of introducing legisla-tion to provide for the only pointnot covered by existing legislation,namely, the extension of the pro-visions concerning repatriation toMasters, would be considered when a suitable opportunity arises:( d) As re ga rds th e r e co mm en da ti onconcerning the general principles for the inspection of the conditionsof work of seamen,  th0 Secretary-General of the League- of nations should be informed that His Majesty&apos;sG ov ernro ent ac c ept s .
MIGRATION.rfoe HarvesterScheme.(previous reference:Cabinet 40(28), Con-clusion 1(a)and Appendix(9).)9.    This subject was placed on the Agenda Paper --.in order that the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs, might raise the following decision ofthe Cabinet:-&quot;Acceptance of the proposal that not less than 5,000 men shouldbe sent.in August next to work as harvesters in Canada&quot;.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs gave the Cabinet details of the schemes which hadbeen worked out by his Department in concert withthe officials of the Ministry of Labour and theBoard of Trade for implementing the above decision.The Canadian Government was understood to be favourable to the scheme;    the Shipping companies had been induced to cut down their charges to  12per head to Winnipeg as compared with the normalcharge of  18. 15. 0 for crossing the Atlantic;arrangements had been made for a flat grant of  5per head towards passages, which might be increased in the case of miners and others who were unableto make any contribution themselves by the loan ofan additional  10 to cover the balance of thepassage as well as the cost of food on the landjourney to Winnipeg and to give the men a poundor two to sustain them while seeking work;to meet the insistance of the Canadian Governmentarrangements had also been made for the repatria-&apos;tlon of such men as could not obtain permanentwork after the harvest.The Cabinet were reminded that a few yearsago a large number of men had been taken asharvesters to Canada at their own cost.In the course of the discussion it transpired that a difficulty had arisen between
zthe Dominions Office and the Treasury in regardto certain details of the scheme.      In view of theImmediate urgency of a decision resulting from thefact that a large number of the emigrants had to start within ten days, the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs had made a personal appeal to theChancellor of the Exchequer, notwithstanding thatthe matter was under consideration between the officials of the two Departments, but the chancellor had felt it necessary to reserve the matter for theCabinet.      On one of the main points of difference,however,  alterations had been made in the scheme tomeet the Treasury views.In these circumstances the Cabinet was prepared to approve the arrangements generally.
MIGRATION. 9.    ^n regard to a decision of the Cabinet atThe Proposed the Meeting referred to in the margin, that theReservationof Areas in representative of the British Government shouldCanada.be authorised to enter into negotiations with the(Previous Canadian authorities with a view to sectoring theRe fer enc e:Cabinet 40 reservation in certain undeveloped districts of(28), Con-elusion 1 areas of land &quot;&quot;or British settlers,  the Cabinetarid Appe^-dix,Para.10.) agreed  That their intention was that theBritish representative should havepower to explore and discuss schemesof this kind but not. to settle them.The results of his discussions shouldbe ad referendum to the Cabinet, and h i s Ma jest 3/&apos;s Gove r run ent mu s t not be committed m any way by these discus-sions.
SCOTLAND.immigration from Ireland(PreviousReference1:Cabinet 40(28), Con-elusion Zm)10. The Cabinet had before their- a Memorandum- circulated by the Home Secretary and the Secretaryof State for Scotland (Paper CP .-268 (28))prepared in accordance with the request made at theMeeting referred to in the margin on the subjectof Immigration from Ireland.   The Note covered theConclusions of an Inter-Pepartmental Conferenceof representatives of the Departments concerned,with which the two Secretaries of State expressed agreement.   The recommendations of the conference were to the effect that the gravity of the situationjustified a departure (which the Conference regarded with some misgiving) from present law and custom;that nothing could be done without legislation;and that such legislation should take the form ofprohibiting for a term&apos; of years the employment ofany person not fulfilling certain requirements which would be laid down as qualifying him to beregarded as properly belonging to and ordinarily resident in this country who should arrive in thiscountry after a specified date and who had not obtained a permit from the Ministry of Labour oran Employment Exchange.    The permit, which wouldordinarily be issued only after the applicant&apos;arrival in this country, would specify a particularoccupation and a particular employer,  and it wouldbe an instruction to Employment Exchanges that nosuch permit should be issued if workmen capable ofperforming the work were available locally or couldbe made available from other Exchanges.   The permitswould only be granted in exceptional cases.Penalties would be imposed on any person knowinglyemploying such an immigrant who was not in possession
of a permit and on such an -irnrrigrarrt acceptingemployment, and power should be taken to removean immigrant found in contravention of the law.Exception might be made in favour of certainclasses o^ workers, e.g., female domestic servants, and arrangements might be sanctionedunder which an exchange of skilled workers inthe same trade might be made between employers in this country and outside.   Courts of summary jurisdiction would have power to order the removalof any such immigrants who become chargeable tothe Poor Rate within a specified period of their arrival in this country .After some discussion, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That further information was required in regard to the extentof the immigration from Ireland,and more particularly the effect which the proposals before them would have upon Northern Ireland,which, they were reminded, is an integral part of the United Kingdom.The Home Secretary and the Secretaryof State for Scotland were invited^&apos;to enquire further into thesematters, and the former was author-is ed to consult the Prime Ministerof Northern Ireland confidentiallyon the subject:(b) That the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should pressMr Cosgrave onthe question of there patriation of immigrants from southern Ireland   -wiio   -^ad become a charge on the Poor Law.
THE WESTERNHIGHEANDSS TEA. TVERSERVICES.(previous reference:Cabinet 39(28), Con-clusion 18.)11.The Cabinet had before their. Memoranda bythe Secretary of State for Scotland (Paper C.P.-259 (28)) and by the Postmaster-General (paper c.P.-263 (28)) in regard to the recommendationsof the Select Committee(House of Commons Paper-No .117) on the subject o^ the Western HighlandsSteamer   Services .The Secretary of State for Scotland statedin his Memorandum&apos; that, after preliminary confer-ences -with the representatives of the L.M.S. andCoast Lines and with, the Treasury and otherDepartments concerned, he was disposed to prefer the first scheme proposed by the Select Committee,which provided for an annual subsidy of  50,000for ten years.    He asked the Cabinet&apos;s generalauthority, however,  to make the best bargain hecould within the commitments of one or other ofthe schemes,  subject to consultation with theTreasury.    Sir John Gilmour also asked in his memorandum for authority for the introduction next session of a Bill to confer the necessary powersand to five the necessary undertaking to indemnify the new Company for any expenditure incurred in anticipation of the scheme going through.    It wasalso mentioned in the Memorandum that the Ministerof Transport wishes to make it cle&amp;r that a bill of this kind, enabling a Department to conferpowers normally conferred only by Parliament, wouldbe an innovation and may arouse criticism, though he did not dissent from the proposal, which appeared to be the only alternative.   Finally,  theSecretary of State for Scotland asked for a freehand to decide whether there should be GovernmentDirectors on the Board of the new Company.
The Postmaster-General&apos;s Memorandum statedthat, after talcing the opinion of the Solicitorto the Post Office, he was of opinion that hehad no statutory authority to enter into a contractsuch as was suggested t-y the Select Committee;that it ?.rould be neither convenient nor appropriate for the Post Office to enter into a contract ofthe nature contemplated, since any demands formodified or additional services would almost certainly be based on passenger and cargo require-ments, and the cost of meeting them&apos; could not properly be defrayed out of the Post Office Vote.The Secretary of State for Scotland, however,considered that there was no practicable alterna-tive to the continuance of the past practice bythe Post Office and of their making a contracteven though it might be technically ultra vires.The Cabinet were informed that it would notbe possible to sign a contract untilThe Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve generally the proposalsof the Secretary of State for scotland as summarised above:(b) That the Secretary of State forScotland should be authorised toinitial the Heads of the Agreement.

THE IRISHFREE STATE .) SilverCurrencyin.(previous reference:Cabinet 30(28)    Cor-clusion 11.)14. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer (Paper CP.-264 (28))covering a Memorandum prepared, in the Treasury inregard to British silver coin in the Irish FreeState, in which Mr Churchill raised the question asto whether he should proceed with the negotiations on the basis that unless a satisfactory compromiseis reached with Mr- Gosgrave the necessary legisla-tion would be passed to prevent the dumping inthis country of British silver currency renderedsurplus by the new Irish currency.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs asked that he should be kept in touch with alldevelopments of this question.The Cabinet agreed  That the Chancellor of the exchequer should be authorised to proceed withthe negotiations with Mr Cos graveon the basis that unless a satisfac-tory compromise is reached thenecessary legislation would be passed to prevent the dumping inthis country of British silvercurrency rendered surplus by thenew Irish currency, and took note that the Chancellor of the exchequer would circulate a draft of his nextcommunication with Mr Cosgrave onthe subject before sending it.

APPENDIX II.The King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament.August 3, 1928.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,THE visit of Their Majesties the King and Queen of Afghanistan in march last was an auspicious event in the history of Our two countries. To Me it will always be a pleasant memory, and I have received with much gratification messagesfrom King Amanulla expressing His warm appreciation of the welcome accorded to Their Majesties. It is a matter of national congratulation that the visit has confirmed and strengthened the good relations existing between Afghanistan andthe British Empire.My Government have been happy to accept the proposed treaty for therenunciation of war in the form in which it was finally proposed to them bythe Government of the United States. The proposed treaty has similarly beenaccepted by My Governments in the Dominions and by the Government of India.It is My confident expectation that, when completed, it will constitute a new and important guarantee of the world&apos;s peace.Negotiations between My Government and the French, Italian and SpanishGovernments for the revision of the Tangier Statute have just reached a successful conclusion. Under the terms of the instrument embodying theresults of these negotiations, which I have caused to be laid before you, Italybecomes a contracting party to the Statute and Spain receives additionalguarantees for the security of her zone.A treaty between Myself and His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia,regulating the commercial relations between Our countries, and providing for the abrogation of existing treaty provisions which limit the right of Persia to settleher customs tariff autonomously, has been signed by Our respective representatives.They have also recorded agreements on other important questions in subsidiarynotes.   The texts of these documents will be laid before you in due course.In harmony with the Resolution of the Imperial Conference of 1926,recommending the further development of the present system of consultation between My Governments, arrangements have been completed for the appoint-ment by My Government in Great Britain of a representative in Canada, withthe title of High Commissioner.   He will proceed to Ottawa in September.The Imperial Wireless and Cables Conference has submitted a unanimousreport on the improvement of telegraphic communications between the severalparts of My Empire. To the principles underlying the report the Governmentsconcerned are favourably disposed. I hope that with whole-hearted co-operation the telegraph systems which unite its various parts will be organised to thelasting benefit of My Empire.The Order in Council under the British Guiana Act, 1928, enabling Me tocreate a new Constitution for that Colony, has been passed.The Commission appointed to examine the Constitution of Ceylon has now presented its report, and its recommendations will receive the careful con-sideration of My Ministers.The Commissioners appointed to enquire into agriculture and ruraleconomy in British India have submitted a unanimous report, containing manyrecommendations for the promotion of the welfare of the rural population. Iam confident that these recommendations will receive sympathetic and fruitfulconsideration from the competent authorities in India.18014
sMembers of the House of Commons,I thank you for the provision you have made for the public service.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,The condition of our basic industries and the high level of unemploymentcontinue to cause Me anxiety. My Ministers have prepared a scheme for relieving agriculture and other productive industries from the onerous burdenof rates. The relief will affect not only the direct burden of rates but also the indirect burden thrown specially upon the basic industries by the presentsystem of rating railways, docks and canals. This policy involves as a necessaryconsequence the enactment of long-desired reforms in local government and inthe financial relations between the State and local authorities. My ministers are hopeful that in respect of selected industrial and agricultural traffic the reliefmay come into force at the end of the present year. I trust that thesecomprehensive proposals will not only increase employment generally, but willalso bring special relief to the areas which are most in need of it.I have given My assent to a measure assimilating the Local Government and parliamentary Franchise of men and women. This will confer equal electoralrights on the two sexes.A Bill has been passed, based generally on the recommendations of MyCommission on National Health Insurance, whereby the existing system will be materially simplified and improved.Steady progress has been made during the year in the provision of housingfor the people, and the price of house construction has continued generally to fall.I have given My assent to a measure for assisting the credit of persons engaged in agriculture in England and Wales, and My Government have prepared a scheme for effecting the same object in Scotland.A Bill has been passed to provide for the grading and marking ofagricultural produce.It is a source of special satisfaction to Me that it has been found possible,subject to suitable safeguards, to secure permanently the present rates ofdisability pension for the Great War against any reduction owing to a fall inthe cost of living. This will remove an element of uncertainty which disturbsthe minds of those who are, unhappily, still suffering from the effects of their war service.The rapid growth of road traffic has created new problems which demandinvestigation. I have appointed a Commission which will, I hope, result in measures for the wise development of all available means of transport.Bills have also been passed to reorganise certain Scottish Departments,and for setting up a Commission to deal with educational endowments inScotland.It is My earnest praj^er that the blessing of Almighty God may rest, upon all your past and coming labours.
