THE racecourse betting- BILL .(previous reference cabinet 36(88), Con-clusion 6.;1,-The Cabinet had before them a letter from lord Hamilton of Dalzell, dated July 6, 1928,circulated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(Paper C.P.-219 (28)), appealing to Mr Churchill,as the Minister who gave the promise of &quot;facilities&quot;last Autumn, to see that the Bill is not wreckedin the House of Commons.The Cabinet were reminded that in theprevious Autumn a statement had been made onbehalf of the Government in the House of commons to the effect that if the House of Commons passed the Second Reading of the Racecourse Betting Billfacilities would be given.   They were furtherreminded of the following decision which they themselves had taken on June 27th:-&quot;That,  subject to it being found possible to obtain the necessaryParliamentary time, facilities should be given for the passage ofthe Racecourse Betting Bill andthe Whips should be put on&quot;.(Cabinet 35 (28), Conclusion 8,)The Cabinet were informed that the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer had notified this decision to the promoters of the Bill.In these circumstances the Cabinet feltthat there was no alternative but to grantfacilities.    They were reminded, however, thatthe time-table of the House of Commons was already very full and that if the Racecourse Betting bill were to be pushed through it might even result ina prolongation of the Session, which was generally agreed to be undesirable.The suggestion was made that the promoters of the Bill should be offered one day of Parlla-mentary time in addition to an all-night Sitting,.--t ...
as this would test the amount of support whichthey could count on.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he wouldbe satisfied with an arrangement of this kind.The Cabinet agreed -(a) To confirm their previous decision,quoted above, that facilities shouldbe given for the passage of theRacecourse Betting Bill and the Whipsshould be put on:(b) That a very early opportunity should,if possible, be found for dealingwith the matter in Parliament:(c) That the precise arrangements for implementing this decision shouldbe left to the Prime Minister andthe Government Whips .
THE COLLEGEOP HERALDS.(previous reference:Cabinet 51(27), Gon-clusion 5.)2. The Cabinet had before them the Report ofthe Cabinet Committee on the Heralds * College(Paper C.P.-185 ( 28)) recommending proposals forthe improvement of the working of the College ofArms, on the understanding that no legislation will be required.   The recommendations containedin the Report are as follows:-I,   That a Standing Inter-DepartmentalCommittee, consisting of representa-tives of the College of Arms and ofthe Government Departments concerned,be established, to which should bereferred for discussion all questions relating to any work of the Collegewhieh affects (i) touching the exerciseof the Prerogative for which the HomeSecretary or other Ministers areconstitutionally responsible for advising the Crown, or (II) government policy at home or abroad*II.   That the Earl Marshal should be Invitedto Issue instructions to the College -(A)a   That in future no Petition to theCrown be prepared by an Officerof Anes without previous consultation with the Home Office.(B)a   That in future all Pees payable in respect of Grants or RoyalWarrants of or for -Change of name and arms.Hereditary Supporters to Baronets,Foreign Titles,Precedence,should be paid to the CollegeSustentation Fund and devoted togeneral College purposes.(C),    That a fixed sum should be deducted from the Fee chargeable by the college for a Royal Licence inthe case of a petitioner whodraws up and presents his ownPetition.(D)o    That no Pees should in future hecharged to representatives of theLaw Officers and other GovernmentDepartments or Officers of theHouses of Parliament seekingofficial information from the records of the College, and that every facility should be given to themin such cases .
(E).    That In any case of doubtful ormixed domicile there should beconsultation between the college and Lyon or Ulster^ as the case may be,, before steps are takento make any grant or to act asagent in connection with a grant and that in cases of disputedjurisdiction the wishes of theapplicant should prevail.Ill,,    That the Earl Marshal should be invitedtc give further consideration to thequestion of the Grant of Badges toLocal Authorities In the light of theEcme Secretary&apos;s representations.      Inthe event of it being decided tocontinue the practice of granting suchBadges^ no action in an individual case to be taken without previous consulta-tion with the Home Office, and any Peesreceivable In respect of Grants ofBadges to be paid, to the College Susten-tation Fund and devoted to generalCollege purposes.IV.    That the Home Secretary be invited torefer future Petitions for change ofname and arms to Garter only for report,Instead of to the three Kings of Arms,so as to ensure that no Officer of Armsbe asked to report on a Petition inthe success of which he may be interested.THE COLLEGE OF ARMS AM) PUBLIC OPINION.9.   While there Is little evidence to showthat at the present time the publicentertains any serious misgivings on thesubject of the remuneration of the Officersof Arms, we feel that if the College is tocontinue to retain the confidence andesteem of the general public and outsideexperts^ it is essential that the Officersof Arms without exception should possess the requisite academic and technical qualifications for their posts in ahigh degree.     We suggest -(a) That the Earl Marshal should considerthe best method of ensuring that due regard is had to this consideration in the case of future vacancies, and(h) That before submitting names to HisMajesty for appointment to the college of Arms., the Earl Marshal should consult with the Master of the Rollsand alsc with academic and historicalauthorities of distinction.We also consider &quot;(c) That a printed list of fees charged bythe College should be available forpub lie i r.f o rma t i on 0
The Cabinet agreed  -(a) Til at the Dominions Office shouldbe represented on the StandingInter-Departmental Dommittee whenany matter affecting the Dominionswas tinder consideration, and thatthe Scottish Office should be repre-sented when matters affecting scotland were under consideration:(b) That the Home Secretary should havethe right, if he thinks fit, toobtain the opinion of the LawOfficers of the Crown on thequestion of the nature and extentof his powers in the matter ofappoint ents to the College of Ariss:(c) Subject to the above, to approve the Report of the Cabinet Committee(Paper CP.-185 (28)), the recom-mendations of which are quoted above.

These proposals had includedhis own Memorandum (Paper C.P.-210 (28)) dealingwith Safeguarding and Imperial Preference.   TheChancellor of the Exchequer, who was Chairman ofthe Committee, had doubted if the Committee could usefully discuss a matter which could not be dealtwith without a. prior decision of the Cabinet on policy.    The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs informed the Cabinet that he did not dispute this,and that he was willing that the Committee shouldnot deal with it unless and until it receivedspecific instructions from the Cabinet to do so.

EGYPT.(previous reference:Cabinet 30(S3), Con-elusion 6.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that King Fuad of Egypt hadintervened in the situation, had dismissed theGovernment of Nahas Pasha, and had formed a new government under Mohammed Mahmoud.   This new government was probably less hostile to us thanthat of Nahas Pasha.   Prom telegrams Nos. 340 and341 from Lord Lloyd, at Cairo, it appeared thatthe Egyptian Parliament would probably be suspendedfor two or three years, during which the situation would be studied with a view to introducing a systemof representative government better adapted to theneeds and understanding of the Egyptian people.It happened that Hafiz Afifi, the new egyptian foreing Minister, was in London and had made certaintentative proposals, which are referred to in theConclusions given below.After hearing further details of the position from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,and after considerable discussion, the Cabinet-agreed -(a) To approve the proposal of theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs that, in accordance withhis public declarations that wehad no desire to interfere withthe Egyptian Constitution, heshould abstain from giving counselto King Fuad and the new egyptian foreing Minister if they decide to govern at present without a Parlia-ment, but should continue to work withthe new regime provided that itcomplies with our own rights and responsibilities under the Deolara-tion of 1922:(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should adopt are served attitude towards anyproposal that the Egyptian ForeignMinister might make for a military agreement, since the moment isinopportune for such negotiations,as the Egyptian Government is about to carry out a political coup d&apos;etat:
(o) That, in regard to any ptopoaaltouching the possible withdrawalof British troops from the Citadel,Cairo, Sir Austen Chamberlainshould make it perfectly clear thatit is a matter he is not willing todiscuss at present:(d) That in the event of any proposalfor the evacuation of the Kasr elNil Barracks, insomuch   ar beforethe War we had agreed to evacuatethese Barracks and had acceptedpayment for them. Sir Austen shouldnot meet a proposal^ accompanied byan offer for the provision of alternative accommodation, with a flat negative, but should make itclear that the site of the altema-tive accommodation must be subjectto our approval.a
0flTTED 6.The Cabinet had before them the followingTATES OP0ggZCA - documents in regard to the proposals of the Unitedhe Multi- States Government for a Multilateral Treaty forEteral Treaty.the Renunciation of War:-(Previous A Memorandum by the First Lord ofReference: the Admiralty (Paper 0.P.-159 (28))Cabinet 36 calling attention to the important(28)p Con- bearing of the proposed Treaty forelusion 1.) the Renunciation of War on the ques-tion of the United States of America&apos;a.attitude towards a blockade undertaken to enforce the sanctions of the Cove-nant of the League of Nations against an aggressor State:A Memorandum prepared in the ForeignOffice (Paper CP.-212 (28)) on thedraft Treaty for the Renunciation ofWar, with particular reference tothe question of the special regionsmentioned in paragraph 10 of theBritish Note of May 19th:A Letter from the India Office tothe Foreign Office (Paper CP.213(28))in regard to the effect on India&apos;external relations of^the draft treaty for the Renunciation of War, circulated with reference to Paper CP.-212 (28):Correspondence circulated by directionof the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (Paper CP.-214 (28)) with sir C Hurst in regard to certain points arising out of the UnitedStates Note of June 23, 1928:A Note by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs (Paper C.P.-220 (28))covering a Report by Sir Cecil Hurston his conversations in Berlin withthe Legal Advisers of the French andGerman Foreign Offices:A Memorandum by the Lord President ofthe Council (Paper CP.-223 (28)) was handed round at the Meeting of theCabinet.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that the Legal Advisers ofthe British, French and German Governments were all agreed that it was useless to ask the American,Secretary of State to make any alteration in the text of his document.   The three Jurists were also
agreed as to the meaning which could be and oughtto be attached to Mr Kellogg&apos;s text.   The onlypoint that required safeguarding was Article 16 ofthe Covenant, and every thing depended on the wording of that particular passage in the replyto Mr Kellogg.   He was having a reply to theAmerican Secretary of State drafted on the linesof the Memorandum attached to Sir Cecil Hurst1 sReport (Paper CP.-220 (28)), and he would be glad if the Cabinet would either meet themselves orappoint a Committee to consider and deal with thedra^t.The Prime Minister wished that every memberof the Cabinet should have the opportunity ofattending the Meeting, but if anybf his colleagues were engaged he would appreciate the reasons fortheir absence.The Cabinet were reminded that there were certain Indian aspects of the problem.The idea of a &quot;Gentleman&apos;e Agreement&quot;,contained in Lord Balfour&apos;s Memorandum (paper g.?s-225 (28)), was attractive to several of hiscolleagues.   As the Lord President could notattend a Meeting of the Cabinet on the followingday9 the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs undertook to send him the Foreign Office draftat the earliest possible moment, and Lord Balfourundertook to forward his observations in time forthe Meeting.The Cabinet agreed -(a) To meet on the following day,Thursday. July 12th, in the PrimeMinister&apos;s Room, House of Commons,at 6 p.m. to consider the draft despatch to be submitted to themby the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs:
(b) That the despatch, in the formapproved by the Cabinet, shouldbe telegraphed to the Dominionsas the text of the reply it was proposed to send.
IRAQ,. 7, The Cabinet had before them the Report,5he Akhwan signed by the Prime Minister, of a Sub-CommitteeRaids .of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the Akhwan(Previous Situation (Paper C.P.-217 (.28)).   After conferringReference:Cabinet 33 with Sir Gilbert Clayton and Air Vice-Marshal(28), Con-elusion 4.) Sir Edward Ellington, Air Officer Commanding inIraq, the Sub-Committee presented the following recommendations:-(a) Whatever form of organisation is adopted for the defence and admin-istration of the desert tribes ofIraq, the maintenance of a certainnumber of desert Posts Is essential,not only for purposes of defence,but also in order to restrain the tribes on the Iraq side of the border.   Accordingly, we shouldmake no concession of principle on this question.(b) It should be Impressed on Ibn Saudthat we regard the right of Iraq to administer its own territory, andto construct posts within it, asessentially a British interest.(c) On matters of detail, such, forexample, as the number of Posts,their distance from the frontier,etc., we should take as conciliatorya line as possible, in so far as this can be done consistently with insist-ence on the general principle in (b)above.   As regards the number of Posts,these should be limited in the firstinstance to the following:    Rutbah,Muhaiwir, Ain Wiza, Shabicha, Salman,Busaiyah.(The first three of the above arerequired in connection with theAir Route and Pipeline and arebeyond the range of controversy.)(d) We should give Ibn Saud an assurance that we intend to observe Article of the Bahra Agreement,  and that our forces will not cross the common frontier in pursuit of offenders.It should, however, be pointed out to him that, in the case of an organised attack on a township orpost   as opposed to a mere tribalraid   or in the event of a seriesof raids, with which he proves himselfunable or unwilling to deal, we moistreserve to ourselves the right totake such action as we think fit.
(e) The Secretary of State for the colonies should make every effort to effect anExtradition Agreement between theGovernments of Iraq and Najd.(f) Ibn Saud should be informed that itis proposed immediately to considerthe reorganisation of the adminis-tration of the desert tribes.(g) The appointment by Ibn Saud and theGovernment of Iraq of accreditedrepresentatives on either side ofthe frontier should be proposed toIbn Saud.(h) Sir Gilbert Clayton should himselfreturn to resume conversations withIbn Saud, both as an act of courtesyand on account of Sir Gilbert&apos;s friend^relations with him.(I) It might simplify Sir Gilbert Claytonfstask if Ibn Saud were to be given a present, preferably a personal gift,from the King.    Sir Gilbert Claytonshould be asked to submit his sug-suggestions in regard to this recommenda-tion.The Cabinet agreed  (I) To approve the above recommendationsof the Prime Minister&apos;s Sub-Committeeof the Committee of Imperial Defence:(II) That in regard to recommendation (i)Sir Gilbert Clayton should beauthorised to spend up to  500 on a present or presents to Ibn Saud,not from His Majesty,  but from theGovernment.

TheMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries desired an amendment to the Bill which would exempt from its operation the slaughter of animals under the diseases of Animals Act and Orders of the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries.   Mr Guinness wasalso prepared to agree to the inclusion in theamendment of a provision to the effect that allanimals slaughtered under the Diseases of AnimalsActs in Scotland should be killed by a mechanically-operated instrument of a pattern approved by theMinistry of Agriculture and Fisheries.   He desiredthese amendments in order to enable him to fulfilhis responsibility for dealing with diseases of animals in Scotland.   The Secretary of State forScotland, however, was unable to agree that these amendments were necessary or desirable.After hearing the respective points ofview of the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland, theCabinet agreed -That the Lord Chancellor should discuss the matter with the two ministers concerned the same afternoon, with a view to settle-roent.

&quot;by the exercise of the powers of the bills, to direct a Public Inquiry andto report to Parliament if the Companyconcerned failed to make proper provi-sion for the protection of the Interestsof the public.
