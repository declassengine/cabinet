The Cabinet toad before them a Note by theParliamentary Secretary to the Treasury (paper cp.-273 ^28)) and a Memorandum prepare *ed by theTreasury (Paper CP.-277 (28)) on the subject ofParliamentary Business.In the Note by the Parliamentary Secretary tothe Treasury it was stated that in the period from november to Easter the Government would have in all23^? full sittings in which to pass the Local Govem-men t and other Bills, with an additional 10 fullsitting, days if the Government took Private Members&apos;time.   If dissolution were to take place early inMay, the chief legislative measures of the session would have to be dealt with before Easter, leavingonly essential financial and routine business to be disposed of before Prorogation. The date of dissolution-tion must depend upon the despatch after Easter ofthe Budget and the Finance Bill;    the Army and AirForce (Annual) Bill:    the Isle of Man (Customs) Bill,and whatever Supply was deemed necessary.    The firstpossible day for the opening of the Budget would be\   Tuesday, April 9th, the remaining stages taking upto May 15th .In the Memorandum, prepared &quot;by the Treasury(Paper CP.-277 (28)) it was stated that to take thenormal 20 allotted days for Supply plus a Finance bill would carry the Session into June, or the  end of Mayif there were no $whitsun Recess. To end the Sessionby the -middle  of May, i&apos;.e. before Whitsun, it wouldbe necessary either to reduce allotted days to 10 orto leave Supply uncompleted.    There was no precedent for reducing allotted days except during War years,and the alternative course of leaving Supply uncom-pleted would involve the Treasury in considerabledifficulty.
The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurystated that his Memorandum proceeded on the assump-tion of a General Election in rhe summer.   If,  csstated by the Minister of Health, the committee stage of the Rating Relief Bill could not be taken until after Christmas, and if there could be onlyfinancial legislation after Easter, then hecalculated that it would be necessary for Parlia-ment to reassemble after Christmas on January 8thto get through its business.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministryof Health stated that further consideration had led to the view that the programme outlined by theMinister of Health could be advanced several days.It was now thought that the Rating Relief bill could be submitted to the Committee of Home Affairsabout October 25th,  and, if approved by the end. ofOctober, the First Reading could take place shortly after the meeting of Parliament.    If two weeks wereallov/ed for perusal,  the Second Reading and theFinancial Resolution might be taken about November25th.    In this way the first part of the Bill wouldbe disposed o^ before Christmas and the other partsof the Pill and the Schedule could follow after christmas.    If three days were given to the SecondReading, that should ease the Committee stage.Portions of the Eill would follow closely the ReportGovernment0-r the Royal Commission on Local / on which LocalAuthor!t.ie.3 are represented.   Similarly, portions of the Scottish Bill, e.g., those dealing withblock grants,  followed the English Bill.   Thesubstance of both Bills had been widely explained in advance, and perhaps a week &quot;would suffice between
their introduction and the Second Reading.   Thenegotiations which were proceeding with the LocalAuthorities showed that they would probably unitein asking for further financial assistance andthat  they would offer no insuperable opposition tothe Poor Law provisions .    But, in his opinion, itwould be most undesirable to proceed with Part Iof the Bill and allow the General Election to intervene before the passing of the remainder ofthe Bill.In the course of the discussion which followed,various opinions were expressed on the advantages and disadvantages of having an Election at datesfalling between May and October.The Cabinet were reminded of the importanceof passing the following Bills, among others,before Easter:-LAND PURCHASE BILL (NORTHERN IRELAND)UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE  (NORTHERN IRELAND)EXPORT  CREDITS BILL&apos;INDIAN HIGH COURTS BILL.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Parliamentary Secretary tothe Treasury should circulate to theOabinet his views on the most advan-tageous period between May and October,19.39, inclusive,  for holding theGeneral Election.(b) That the Prime Minister should obtainthe views of the Unionist central office on the same question.(c) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should circulate the views of theTreasury on the consequences ofdelaying the Budget pending the holding of a General Election early in the summer.(d) That the programme of government business should be further considered at the next Meeting, of the Cabin&quot;t.
ARM/-.WET-TPS -REDUCTION OPNaval Di s arm-am en t .Pr evi ousRefer enc e cabinet 44(28),  Con-c In si on 4.)2. The Acting Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs informed the Cabinet that the reply had /been received on September 28, 1928, of the Govern-ment of the United States of America to the communi-cation of Kis Majestyfs Government summarising theunderstanding reached between the British and french governments as to a basis of Naval limitationprepared for submission to the Preparatory Commis-sion for the Disarmament Conference (W.9338/28/98) .The Note, while unexceptionable in tone and leaving the door open *or further discussion, did no morethan repeat the position which the United StatesGovernment had already taken up in regard to naval disarmament.   In his view it was not desirable toissue a reply until after the Presidential Electionearly in November, and he had asked our ambassador in Paris to urge the French Government to adopt thesame course.    In the meantime the views of theAdmiralty ought to be obtained,  and the Note couldbe studied by the Sub-Committee of the Committee ofImperial Defence with the object of advising theCabinet as to future action.In tho course of a full discussion attention was directed to the drawbacks of further delay inissuing an authoritative account of the Anglo-Frenchnegotiations from the British standpoint:    to themisapprehensions contained in the American Note;to the difficulty of issuing any explanation wThichtfould bo at once brief an-? intelligible:    to thedemand which would be made by Parliament for thepublication of all relevant documents;    and to theadvantages of postponing publication until afterthe Presidential Election and immediately before themeeting of Parliament.
The suggestion was also put forward that theopportunity should be seized not only of publishing the British reply to the American Note but also&apos; of putting forward the Unionist view of British naval policy generally, and not only with reference tothe recent exchange of Notes with France.The Cabinet  agreed  (a) That the Foreign Office should circulate to the Cabinet copiesof the Notes recently exchangedwith France and other governments on the subject of Naval limitation,with an explanatory account of thenegotiations leading up to thereceipt of the Note from the UnitedStates Ambassador dated September28th, 1928, together with a dra^tof the Reply which, in the view ofthe Foreign Office, should beaddressed to the United States.(b) That the Admiralty should circulate to the Cabinet their views on theAmerican Note and on the reply which in their view should be made.(c) That the foregoing Memoranda shouldbe considered, at the next Meetingof the Cabinet.(d) That the Acting Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs should try to dissuade the French Government fromissuing a Reply until after the presidential Election.(e) That in the meantime no officialReply should be issued by the BritishGovernment, but that the ForeignOffice should take suitable steps toenlighten the Press privately on the true history of the negotiations whichhad led up to the receipt of the UnitedStates Not e .
RUSSIA. 3. The Acting Secretary of State for foreign the Protection     Affairs, referring to the Conclusion of the cabinet of British trawlers on on tb - subj &quot;ct of the Protection of British Trawlersthe Mum-&apos;anCoast, on the Kurman  Coast, stated that the Foreign office had been endeavouring to discover the attitude&apos; previous reference; likely to be taken up by the Soviet Government in cabinet 41(38), Con- the event of British trawlers fishing between the elusion 4 .13 and 12 mile limits under Naval protection.Enquiry was being made with the aid of the norwegian government, who had now communicated the views oftheir representative at Moscow.   So far as could be ascertained, while the use o^ armed force againstEritish Cruisers was unlikely,  some of the fishing vessels operating within the 12-miles limit mightbe arrested if this could be done without collisionwith the Cruisers (F.O. Telegram No.54, dated september 29, 1923) .    In reply to the warning givento the Soviet Government, a communication from thatGovern? ent had been received by the norwegian government a-few days ago, but whether this was morethan a formal protest would not be known until the text had been received and examined here .     The .Foreign Office had been in consultation with theAdmiralty in re eard to the despatch of a cruiser and doubts had been expressed as to the adequacy of a Cruiser off the north coast of Norway for theprotection of trawlers engaged in... thb White Soo.*-o final opinion had been given by the ForeignOffice as to the despatch of the Cruiser.The Cabin&quot;t confirmed their previous decision and er-phasi zed the desira-bility of the Admiralty providingeffective protection.
4. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Lai our (Paper C.P.-275 (23)) onthe subject of a Bill for increasing the borrowing powers of the Unemployment Fund under the Unemploy-ment Insurance Acts, the present limit of which is 30,01)0,000.    In this Memorandum Sir Arthur Steel-Mai tl and stated that revenue does not cover expendi-ture and that it is certain that before long the borrowing powers will be exhausted.   He therefore asked for authority to prepare a Bill, to be intro-duced at the beginning of next Session and passed into la&quot;&apos; as soon as possible.   The Bill would be quite short and restricted to the necessary financial provisions,  the details of which would of course be discussed beforehand with the Treasury.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministryof Labour stated that the debt now stood at 28,000,000 and was increasing at the rate of 250,000 per week.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought itmight be necessary to raise the figure to  35,000,000but there should be no tampering with the present scale of benefits or contributions before theG-e n -ral E1 ec tion.The Cabinet agreed  To authorise the Ministry of: labour to prepare a Bill for increasing the borrowing powers of the Unemployment?und to a limit to be agr^d withthe Treasury.
RATING REPORT--. 5. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by railway Freight the Minister of Transport (Paper C.P.-280 (28)) onRelief.  the subject of Coal for Ireland under the Railway)Coal for ireland. Freight Relief Scheme.    In his Memorandum, the(Prevxou minister stated that, by existing Customs practice,Reference: coal shipped to Northern Ireland is entered asCabinet 40(28) . Con- 11 shioped coastwise&quot; while coal shipped to the elusion 1(b),)Irish Free State is entered as &quot;export&quot;;    so thatif this practice were followed,  coal  for the IrishFree State would be entitled to the rebates fromrailway freights in anticipation of the deratingscheme, while coal for Northern Ireland would not.There appeared to be no economic grounds for givingconsumers in the Free State advantages not extendedto consumers either in Northern Ireland or in GreatBritain, and it therefore seemed desirable thai 41coal for any part of Ireland should be excludedfrom the benefit of the rebate scheme.    The dominions office and the Home Office anticipated that nodifficulty would arise from such exclusion.    TheMinister of Transport also suggested that coal sentto the Channel Islands should be excluded from thebenefit of the scheme, and that it would probablybe advisable to find some term other than &quot;coal  forexport&quot; to describe the traffic to which the rebateshould be applied.The Cabinet agreed  That coal exported to Northern Ireland,the Irish&quot;Free State and the channel islands, should be excluded fromrelief under the Railway FreightRollef Scheme .
THE UNEMPLOY-ME-NT SITUATION.(Pr evi ou.s(^Reference:Cabinet 40(28),  Con-conclusion 1.)5.The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by theMinister of Labour &apos;Paper C.F.-274 (28)) on thesubject of the Recent Trend of Unemployment Figures,in which he stated that any improvement in thegeneral condition of employment in the near futurewas likely to be spasmodic in character and unevenin its effects on different industries, althoughthe present position was distinctly less unsatis-factory than would have appeared? likely at thebeginning of August last.
