1.   The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs asked the Cabinet, as a matter of urgency, toconsider a series of very urgent telegrams,marked &quot;State&quot;, from the British Minister at peking, viz., Nos. 647-651 inclusive, relatingto a serious development of the position inthe italian mining area.The Cabinet were reminded of the previoushistory of this question.     Danger had arisensome weeks ago in this area, owing to the factthat as the Nationalist forces advanced northwardsthe Americans withdrew their troops from theirsection of the Tientsin-Pekingrailway, in whichthis important mining area was situated.      Thequestion had been considered as to whether theAmerican detachment should be replaced bya British force.      There had been two strong objections to this;      first, the section inquestion adjoined the Japanese section, and atthat time the Japanese were particularlyliable to be embroiled with the Chinese, owingto the tsinan-fu-fu incident, and British troops would bein the adjoining section   /     liable to become involved;    secondly,  the general objection toscattering our small forces in China, and theparticular military difficulty in feeding them if the railway were Interrupted.      In thesecircumstances the British-personnel in theKalian mining area had been advised to withdraw.Both the British and some Belgian personnel,however, though aporised of the danger, had
refused to withdraw and to leave in the lurchsome 50,000 friendly Chinese, whose lives wouldhe placed in danger.The new situation,  as disclosed in the telegrams quoted, was that a certain Wang-chi,late of the Pekin gendarmerie, had endeavoured to blackmail the italian Chamber of Commerceto the extent of 100,000 dollars,  on the threatthat if the demand were refused, 3,000 menunder his control would be let loose.      the threat,  if carried out, might easily developinto danger to life and not merely to property.In the circumstances, Sir Miles Lampson,who had hitherto opposed the dispatch of troops to the mining area,  considered, that the position was fundamentally changed, and definitelyadvocated the immediate dispatch of troops to protect both life and property from thesebrigands.Sir Miles Lampson was in communicationwith the General Officer Commanding, who was reported to the Cabinet to be willing toremove a battalion if he were not prohibited from doing so by his present instructions.The Secretary of State for War informed theCabinet that the military opinion of the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff was still opposedto the dispersion of the small British forcesin China in detachments.     He recognised, however that important political Considerations were involved, and that the Cabinet must decide on
the balance of advantage and disadvantage.After a short discussion, the cabinet agreed: -That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should inform theBritish Minister at PekingthatHis Majesty&apos;s Government authorisedwhatever measures he and the GeneralOfficer Commanding thought possiblefor the protection of life and property at Tangshan.
THE PERSIAN 2.   At the request of the Secretary of StateGULP.  for Foreign Affairs, the Cabinet agreed  Policy in.That a Committee of Cabinet Ministers(either a Cabinet Committee or a Sub-Committee of the Committee of ImperialDefence), composed as follows -The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs Tin the Chair),The Lord Chancellor,The Secretary of State for theColonies,The Secretary of State for India,The Secretary of State for Air,The First Lord of the Admiralty,The President of the Board of Trade,The First Commissioner of Works -should examine our policy in thePersian Gulf in the light of thepresent position.
SCHEME OFRATINGRELIEF *(previous reference:Cabinet 35(28),  Con-clusion 3.)3. The Chancellor of the exchequer informed theCabinet that, in accordance with Cabinet 33 (38),Conclusion 3 (d), the Minister of Health and himself had held a meeting with the Minister ofTransport.   They were informed by Colonel Ashleythat he was anxious to make, as from the 1st April,1929, certain concessions in regard to the Classi-fication Grants for Class I and Class II Roads.If these were made it was doubtful whether the finances of the Road Fund would be sufficient toenable a contribution /of  3,000,000. a. year to bemade as from the 1st April, 1930, to the generalscheme of Rating Relief.   On examination itappeared that difficulty would only arise, if atall, In the single year 1931, and that to an extent of not more than  750,000, and the chancellor had accordingly agreed, if necessary,  to forgo somuch of the Exchequer share of the motor licenceduties in that year as would suffice to avoid a deficit on the Road Fund.    On this understanding the Minister of Transport agreed to the proposedcontribution of  3,000,000 a year,  and that thisarrangement should be embodied in the Minister of health  alth1s Memorandam,The Chancellor of the Exchequer also informed the Cabinet, with reference to paragraph (b) of theabove Conclusion, that he had agreed with theMinister of Health that the County Councils and theExchequer should bear in equal shares the cost ofthe temporary arrangements referredto.The Minister of Health informed the Cabinetthat he would, have the amended Memorandum ready for the printer on Monday, and he hoped that itwould be published on the morning of Friday, June 29-th.
REDUCTION AND 4 . The Cabinet had before them the followingLIMITATION of armaments. documents in connection with Reduction and naval Disarm-      Limitation of Armaments, and more particularlyament .Na^al disarmament?-(previous A Memorandum by the Secretary ofReference: State for Foreign Affairs (PaperCabinet 32 CP.-183 (28)) resulting from a(28), Con- conversation with Herr von Schubert,elusion 2.) of the German Foreign Office,pointing out that unless sotreprogress is made on the questionof Disarmament we should be facedby Germany&apos;s repudiation of theDis am-ardent Provisions of theTreaty,of Versailles:A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (paper c.P.-184 (28)),&quot; prepared as theresult of a conversation withM. Paul Boncour, emphasizing that agreement between Great Britainand France was essential to thefurther work of the PreparatoryCommission and giving the presentposition of the conversations between them on the subject of Disarmament:A Memorandum by the Chancellor .ofthe Duchy of Lancaster (Paper C.P.-189 (28)) setting forth how thepresent position had been reached and the extent of the differencethat now divides us from theGovernments of France and thee United States respectively;emphasizing the point made in theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs&apos; Memorandum as to therepercussion on Germany of a failure of the Preparatory Com-mission of the League of nations at Geneva, as well as the unfortunate effect of such an event on a con-siderable volume of opinion in thiscountry on the eve of a GeneralElection:A Memorandum by the First Lord ofthe Ad-admiralty (Paper CP.-190 (28))suggesting that for the tire beingthe attempt to draw up careful and detailed formulae, which havehitherto proved, impossible to reconcile with the varying needsof the different nations, shouldbe abandoned,, and that Mr Kellogg&apos;invitation to make a MultilateralTreaty might afford an opportunityfor this:
A Memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster (Paper G.P.-191 (28)) commenting on the FirstLord&apos;s Memorandum;    pointing outthat, if the advice contained thereinwere followed, we should, howeverunjustly^ incur the blame forbreaking down the whole movement for Disarmament by international agreement:Telegrams from Geneva (Paper C .P.-192 (28)), circulated at therequest of the Chancellor of the duchy.of Lancaster:A Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal(Paper 0.P.-193 (28)) urging theimportance of doing our utmost to save the Preparatory CommissionfroTi shipwreck and containing proposals dealing with the presentsituation:A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for War, covering a Memorandumby the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff on the Re-organisation of theFrench Army (Paper&quot;C0P.-195 (28)).In the course of the discussion the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs brought to the noticeof the Cabinet evidence obtained both in washington and in London that the American State department would welcome private conversations on the subjectof Naval Disarmament, but considered that theinitiative should be taken by the British Govern-ment.   There was, however, also somie evidehde toshow that parity would have to be recognised asthe basis of any such conversations.    The opinion was pressed, however, that, in view of the forthcos.-ing Presidential Election in the United States ofAmerica and the General  Election here next year,it would be risky to enter on such conversations at which the acutely difficult questions in regardto numerical and strategical parity, the 8-inch gun,and so forth, would have to be reopened, with thepossible result that the present relatively favour-able position might be disturbed rather thanimproved .
The Cabinet were informed by the First Lordof the Admiralty that, in the course of a private conversation with Admiral Kelly, the French naval representative at the Geneva Preparatory commission had made some suggestions which he stated werehis own and had not received any endorsement fromthe French Government.   The essential point ofthis proposal, which Mr Bridgeman read to theCabinet, was to limit, on a basis of parity betweenGreat Britain and the United States, and between france and Italy, all Cruisers of 10,000-tons and below which were armed with 8-inch guns or withguns above 6-inch, calibre, but that there should beno limitation on Cruisers armed with 6-inch gunsand below . ,   ...This proposal was felt by the Cabinet to offerprospects of progress towards Naval disarmament,but it was pointed out that this would not in anyway affect the question of disarmament on land,which must be the main preoccupation of the GermanGovernment.   Never the less, it was felt that considerable advantage would be obtained if a breakdown could be avoided on Naval Disarmament,so that the way would be prepared for further progress .After s full discussion, the Cabinet agreed  ( a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should at oncesend a despatch to Paris informing the British Ambassador that theFrench representative on the Pre-paratory Cor)mission of the Leagueof Nations had, unofficially aridwithout authority, in a private conversation with Admiral Kelly,made a proposal (particulars ofwhich would be given) which commendeditself to His Majesty&apos;s Government,and that if the French Governmentwould put it forward formally atGeneva the British representativewould be instructed to support it;
(b)  That it should be understood thatif the French Government were willingto adopt this suggestion the BritishGovernment would not oppose the FrenchGovernment&apos;s wishes on the question. of land armaments, notwithstanding thatthe French wished to exclude militaryreserves from limitation:(o) That the First Lord of the admiralty should send to the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs particulars ofthe actual proposal made by the french naval Representative on the PreparatoryCommission, for incorporation in thedespatch to Lord Crewe:Air Disarmament. (d) To take note that the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs had broached,in conversation with M. Briand, thequestion of some agreement in regardto the strength of the Air Force andhad asked him to consider the possi-bility of a scheme for parity in metropolitan air forces between GreatBritain, France and Italy, but that up to the present Sir Austen Chamberlainhad received no answer.
THE GERMAN 5,    The Lord Privy Seal informed the cabinet proposals FORDISARMAMENT. that the Cabinet.Commit tee on Reduction and limitation of Armaments had considered the Germanproposals for the prevention of war;    that a formula had been drawn up by Sir Cecil Hurst as a substitute for one of the German proposals, andthat Sir Cecil ^ursfs formula formed the subjectof a Report arrived at at a Meeting on theprevious afternoon by the Chiefs of Staff.   lord salisbury asked his colleagues on the Committeeto remain behind on the conclusion of the cabinet meeting to consider the Chiefs of Staff Report( 0.0.S.-168).
6. The Cabinet had before them a Most secret memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on the subject of the Easts of Navy Estimates(Paper C.P.-169 (28)), proposing that the Committeeof Imperial Defence should be asked to advise the Cabinet upon the general assumptions whichshould now govern our preparations for war, withparticular reference to the Estimates of theFighting Services;    and further suggesting that,when these general assumptions were settled, the correspondence attached to the Memorandum shouldbe referred to the Naval Programme Committee.,which was recently constituted a Standing Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence;also that certain questions relating to anti-aircraft guns for the Fleet should be referredto the Committee of Imperial Defence.In the course of the discussion the FirstLord of the Admiralty suggested that the questionof detail raised in the correspondence between theTreasury and the Admiralty should be discussed atthe full Committee of Imperial Defence before beingreferred to any Sub-Committee, but the Chancellorof the Exchequer preferred his own proposal.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Committee of Imperial defence should be asked to advise the Cabinetupon the general assumptions whichshould now govern our preparations for war, with particular referenceto the Estimates of the FightingServices:(b) That the Committee of Imperial defence should also be asked to consider certain questions relating to anti-aircraft guns for the Fleet.
7 . The Cabinet bad before then; telegrams,circulated at th&quot; request of the First Sea Lordof the Admiralty (Paper C.P.-196 (28)), from theNaval Commander-in-Chief asking for the withdrawalof the Third Flotilla from China,.The First Lord proposed to agree to this request , on the understanding that, if necessary,another Flotilla would be sent out whom the watgrThe Cabinet authorised the FirstLord of the Admiralty to informthe Naval Commander-in-Chief thathis proposal for the withdrawalof the Third Flotilla from china was sanctioned unless Sir ReginaldTyrwhitt had altered his view as a consequence of the present positionin North China.is  /orb.gjBoa en. tho Yangtoe.
CHINA.Powers and authority ofthe naval commander-In-Chief.(PreviousRefereno e:Cabinet 32(38)    Con-olusxon 4.)0 . The Cabinet had before them a Note circulatedby the First Sea Lord of the Admiralty, In theabsence of the First Lori, concerning the powersand authority delegated to Admiral Tyrwhitt, theNaval commander-in-&apos;Chief in China (Paper C.P.-181(28)).The suggestion was made to the Cabinet thatthe present powers of the Naval Commander-in-Chief,conferred on him during various episodes in the crisis of the last 18 months, were in fact rather less than those implicit in his standing instruc-tions ,   The former, according to the First sea lord&apos;s Note, only authorised the Admiral to take action consecuent on some offensive action oroutrage by the Chinese, whereas the standinginstructions enabled him to take action &quot;in a case&quot;where British life and property are at stake and&quot;require immediate Naval interference&quot;;    in other words, the standing instructions appeared toenable him to act in a case of imminent danger,whereas the special powers, conferred during the crisis, did not.The Cabinet asked the First Lordof the Admiralty to consult theFirst Sea Lord on the question, inorder to ensure that the powers ofthe Naval Commander-in-Chief weresufficient to enable him to act ina case of imminent danger.
THE PLACINGOP WREATHSCN FOREIGNWAR MEMORIALS(previous reference:Cabinet 31(28), Oon-elusion 9.)9.  The Cabinet had before them a Eeroorandumby the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Secretaryof State for War and the Secretary of State forAir (Paper C.P.-173 (28)) suggesting that in allcountries involved in the Great War the general feeling would probably be in favour of discontinu-ing the placing of wreaths on foreign War Memorialsand official participation in such ceremoniesabroad;    proposing that November 11, 1928,  the10th anniversary of the Armistice, should be thelast occasion of such participation;    and asking that this country should take the initiative now and propose a definite agreement on these linesthrough diplomatic channels .The Cabinet agreed  That no action should be taken at the present time.
