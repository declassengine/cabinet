IHB SLAUGHTEROP ANIMALS(SCOTLAND)BILL.(previous on 5Reference:Cabinet 37(28), Con-elusion 8.)1. The Lord Chancellor reported to the Cabinetthat on the previous evening he had discussed with the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland thedifficulty in regard to the Slaughter of Animals(Scotland) Bill and that agreement had beenreached.-1-
THE UNITEDSTATES OP jffiRlCA.rpjie Multi-lateralTreaty.(previous reference:Cabinet 37(28).  Con-elusion 6.)g. The Cabinet met for the purpose of eonslder-ing a draft despatch to His Majesty*s Representa-tive in Washington (Paper C.P.-226 (28)), Whichhad been circulated by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affaire.   In addition to the draft despatch they had before them the same documentsas at the previous Meeting of the Cabinet referredto in the margin.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs drew the attention of the Cabinet to telegramNo.42 from Berlin containing the German reply tothe American proposal, which was in line with theproposed British reply but contained a somewhatobscure phrase which Sir Cecil Hurst, &quot;8.4?*-^. his conversations with Dr Gaus, iwfrpgp^otod as imply-ing that the Germans did not agree with themeaning attached by the American Secretary ofState to Article 16 of the Covenant.   Sir austen chamberlain then read a note he had received fromM. de Fleuriau, the French Ambassador, in regardto the French, reply, which appeared to be con-ceived on the same lines as the draft circulatedby the Secretary of State.Before the Meeting, the Earl of Balfour(who was absent in the country on medical advice)telephoned for consideration by the Cabinet thefollowing suggestions for corrections to theSecretary of state draft:-Page 1T line 15 from the bottom:For the phrase.&quot;the renunciation of war as an instrument ofnational policy&quot; substitute&quot;the renunciation of fprce,as an instrument of national policy&quot;.
Page 3, for lines 15 to 18 substitute the following:-&quot;with regard to whose welfare and integrity His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have special responsibilities, Eis Majesty&apos;sGovernment in Great Britainhold the view that interferencewith these regions or withthe discharge of these responsi-bilities cannot be allowed.Their protection from attackis for the British Empire ameasure of self-defence&quot;.Page 3- line Z from the bottom:For the word &quot;willing* put the word &quot;glad&quot; .In regard to the first of the above sugges-tions the Cabinet preferred the use of the word&quot;war&quot; as in the original draft, instead of theword &quot;force&quot;, on the grounds, first, that theword &quot;war&quot; was used in Mr Kellogg&apos;s proposal;and, second, that the word &quot;force&quot; was a much wider term,  and that the renunciation of &quot;force&quot;might be interpreted to preclude such actionffu^r- trusts.as that of the Americans in Nicaragua and porhopowen-fee despatch of battleships to Alexandria.Some discussion took place as to whetherthe word &quot;force&quot; might with advantage be substi-tuted for &quot;war&quot; in the 3lxth line from the bottom of the page, that is to say, in the phrase &quot;that war should be resorted to&quot;, butthis also did not commend itself to the Cabinet.In regard to the second of Lord Balfour&apos;suggestions the Cabinet, after careful considera-tion, preferred the original draft, which wasadopted subject to an alteration referred to inthe Conclusions below.The third of Lord BalfourTs suggestions,namely, the substitution of the word &quot;glad&quot; for
&quot;willing&quot;, in the third line from the end of the note, was adopted.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the draft Note attachedto Paper CP.-226 (28) subject tothe following amendments:-Page IT line 6 from the bottom;For the phrase &quot;that war would beresorted to&quot; substitute &quot;thatresort would be had to war&quot;.Page 2T lines 15 and IS;For the phrase &quot;constitute aspecial and vital interest forthe peace and safety gf thiscountry&quot; substitute &quot;constitute a special and vital interest forour peace and safety&quot;.(NOTE:    This amendment was inserted inorder to meet the case of a dominion (or India) which might regard itself as concerned inone of the special and vital interests of Great Britain, -such as Egypt or the persian gulf.)TMjd-line from the end^ of ,the paragraph:For &quot;willing&quot; substitute &quot;glad&quot;.At, the end of the Note insert a sent-ence to the following effect:-&quot;His Majesty^ Government in GreatBritain rejoice to be associatedwith the Governments of the UnitedStates of America and the other parties to the proposed treaty in a further and oimpjxi advance in the outlawry of war&quot;.(A copy of the Note, as finally approved, isattached i.n the Appendix.)(b) That the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should at oncecommunicate the text of the Note,as approved by the Cabinet, to theDominions, and should inform themthat it would be handed to theAmerican Government on Wednesday next, July 18, 1928.(o) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should communicatea copy of the Note confidentially-to the French Ambassador.^U-tehall Gardens, S.W.1, .  . .July 12,  1928.*7
