SCOTLAND .Iromig rationfrom Ireland.2. In the course of the discussion referred toin the preceding Minute on the subject of migration, the attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the strong feeling aroused in scotland at the great influx of immigrants from Ireland,many of whom were undesirable characters.

APPENDIX   ^REPORT OP MIGRATION SUB-COMMITTEE.SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL RECOMMENDATIONS.(As approved by the Cabinet on 25rd July, 1928).(1) The Sub-Committee entirely agree withthe Industrial Transference Board asto the necessity for simplifyingmigration procedure and dispensing with non essential formalities and restrictions,and recommend that this question whichthey regard as of primary and urgentimportance shown ;ld be at once taken up withthe Dominion Governments.    (Paragraph 4).(2) A scheme for the reduction of passagerates should not discriminate on the ground of destitution, but there should be s uniformreduced rate of which any reputable british subject should be eligible to take advantage.(Paragraph 5),(3) The negotiations between the BritishGovernment and the Shipping companies should be directed to securing that theCanadian standard Third Class passage rate should, durins the emergency period ofthe next three to five years, be reduced in the case of British subjects to a figure as near  10 as possible(Paragraph 8 ) .(4) In the case of any Intending migrantwho is able to satisfy the competent authority in Great Britain -(a) that he cannot migrate withoutfinancial assistance;(b) that It is reasonable that he should seek work overseas and that&quot;, he islikely to make a good settlerarrangements should be made for the advance to him of a free ticket,  outfit, landingmoney, etc. up to such amount not exceeding 25 In value  (assuming a standard fare of  10),as may be recommended by the competent authority.     Arrangements should be made inCanada under which the shipping and/orrailway companies would undertake to do their best to recover the advances on thebasis of a small commission (Paragraph 11).
(5) It Is essential that an agreement shouldbe reached with the Canadian Governmentthat that Government (l) will not regard the above arrangements as 1 charitymigration&apos; or treat the persons taking advantage of the scheme as &quot;assistedmigrants&apos; and will therefore not treat the men as prohibited migrants, and (2)will not raise the present 1 landing rate&apos;of 20 dollars a head in the case of Britishmigrants without previous consultationwith the British Government.(Paragraph 12).(6) As regards Australia a substantial increaseIn the number of Requisitions&apos; Is needed.The conditions of entrance to Australiashould be Intelligible and fixed, theprocedure easy, and the policy stable overa period of years.     These and other considerations raised in paragraph 120and elsewhere in the Report of theIndustrial Transference Board should bevigorously taken up with the Australianauthorities.After a better understanding has beenreached with the Australian Authoritiesnegotiations should be undertaken with theshipping companies with a view to securing a substantial reduction of the ordinaryAustralian passage rate.    (Paragraph 14).(7) The proposals of the Oversea SettlementCommittee for the annual training at homeand settlement overseas of 2,500 boys.7,000 single men, 2.5O0 families and2,000 single women at a total net costestimated at  601,300 a year should beaccepted on the understanding that in thecase of the scheme for the annualrecruitment, training and migration of2,000 single women every effort will bemade to secure a Dominion oontributiontowards the estimated cost ( 59,600 perannum) equivalent in amount to that madeby the British Government.    (Paragraph 16).(8) Acceptance of the Land Settlement LoanScheme is recommended on condition that thescheme fa placed on a pound for pound basis,&apos;i.e. that the British Government loan of a hundred pounds Is equated by a contribution of like aritount from some Canadian source.(Paragraph 18).
(9)   Acceptance of the proposal that notless than 5000 men should he sent InAugust next to work as harvesters inCanada is recommended.    (Paragraph 19).(10)   The Sub-Committee recommend that therepresentative of the British Governmentshould be authorised to enter into negotiations with the Canadian authorities with a view to securing the reservation incertain undeveloped districts of areas ofland for British settlers.     The negotiations to proceed upon the basis that the BritishGovernment are willing to make arrangements with existing organisations, such as theProvincial Governments, the Canadian PacificRailway or the Hudson&apos;s Bay Company, forjointly financing development schemes by which british migrants may be &quot;employed andsettled,  (Paragraph 20).(11)   The Sub-Committee state that various suggestions have been submitted to them for strengthening the existing official adminis-trative machinery in this country concernedwith migration.     1;nile they do not feel ableto make any specific recommendations as towhat changes should be made, they are satisfiedas to the need for strengthening the central organisation and for securing the fullest possible measure of effective co-operationbetween the various Departments concerned withthe subject.The Sub-Committee accordingly recommend thatthe Secretary of State for Dominion affairs should, after consultation with the Treasury,submit recommendations to the Prime minister with as little delay as possible,  (paragraph 21).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.20th July, 1928.(iii)
