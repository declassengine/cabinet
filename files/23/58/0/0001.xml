ARMAMENTS.Reduction of.(previous reference:Cabinet 16(28), Con-clusion 6.)1. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterbrought before the Cabinet, as a natter of urgency, a telegram from the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs from Geneva (No. 56 L.N., ofJune 3rd) giving the result of a conversationSir Austen Chamberlain had had with M. Briandon the subject of Naval Disarmament.   In this telegram Sir Austen Chamberlain reported thatthe French Council of Ministers was unanimouslyof opinion that an agreement mast be reached with us.    The basis proposed was an agreement on a formula, which would determine the relativecruiser strength according to the length of lines of communication.    It had been arranged that Sir Austen was to discuss the question fully with M. Bone our, when he would try to get anagreement on these lines added.    The telegramconcluded by asking for the observations of lord salisbury, Lord Cushendun and the Admiralty atthe earliest possible moment.Lord Cushendun said that after communicationwith Lord Salisbury, ^ixo was in Dorsetshire, hehad had a discussion with the First Sea Lord ofthe Admiralty, in the absence of the First Lord,the previous afternoon.    As the result of this latter discussion he had sent to the foreign secretary the telegram attached as Appendix I tothese Minutes,The First Sea Lord said that the difficultyin discussing the present proposal was to knowprecisely what the French intended by a formulabased on &quot;length of lines of communication&quot;.
There were three possibilities.   The first wasthe lines of communication between a country andits Oversea Possessions.    A calculation on this basis would place the principal Naval Powers inthe- following order:-   The British Empire, France,the United States of America (with communicationsabout half the length of the British Empire) ,Italy (whose communications would be less than half those of France), and Japan.    Germany, having no Oversea Possessions, would be entitled to nocruisers under this formula.    Second, the meaningmight, be the length of the lines of coiauunicationof the whole of the oversea trade of the country.That would place the British Empire, the UnitedStates of America, France, Italy and Japan aboutequal, with a slight preponderance to the BritishEmpire.    A third possible interpretation of theformula was that suggested by Lord Jellicoe atthe Three-Power Conference at Geneva, namely,to take the total number of ships engaged inoversea trade on a particular day and multiply it by miles.    This formula would put the BritishEmpire first, the United States of America second,Japan third, France and Italy being about equal.It seemed very   probable that France intendedthe first of these three methods as a be-sis of calculation, since her object was to obtain agreater cruiser tonnage than Italy.    On the otherhand, it was extremely unlikely that the Americansor the Italians would look at such a formula.
The Admiralty&apos;s opinion was that,, whereas weshould have .arguments to Justify the cruiserstrength necessar;/ for national security aid to criticise the proposals of other Powers, it wasnot possible to devise a precise formula whiohcould be universally applied.    Length of communi-cations itself, for example, was no criterion ofthe value and essential nature of the trade tothe life of a nation, nor did it indicate theextent of its vulnerability.    All that could bedone usefully was for each country to state its requirements in cruisers in the situation as itexisted today, and to be prepared to justify their claim in argument.    V/e Justified our clain on anumber of factors, including the length of commu-nications, the volume of trade, the nature of thetrade and the geographical position of the traderoute in relation to other Ifeval Powers whoserelative naval strength could not be ignored inthis connection.    Sir Charles Madden quoted, inconclusion, the following extract from a Memorandumby the First Lord (Paper P.R.A.  (27) 50:-&quot;For these reasons it would surelybe better policy to abandon, at anyrate for the tine, the attempt todraw up careful and detailed formulae ,which have hitherto proved impossibleto reconcile with the va,rying needsof the different Nations.Mr Kellogg&apos;s invitation to make a multilateral Treaty offers the oppor-tunity of convincing public opinionthat we are as much &quot;opposed to war as any other Nation, if we give a ready and generous response to &quot;it.Is not this the moment to desistfrom attempts to devise mathematical  -tables, to avoid the risk of returning
to the state of friction whichMinor differences provoke, and,having made a public declarationof the will of all the great Ifotionsfor peacejto leave it to each nation to make such reductions as theircircumstances demand and their needfor self-defence will admit?&quot;,The Cabinet felt great difficulty intaking a decision on a subject of such graveimport in the absence of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.    In any event they decidedthat they could not usefully continue the discus-sion until they knew with greater precisionexactly what the French Government intended bythe proposal for &quot;a formula which would determinerelative cruiser strength according to length of lines of communication&quot;*The Cabinet agreed  That Lord Oushendun should send a telegram to the above effectto the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.(NOTE.    A copy of the telegram sent byLord Cushendun is attached inAppendix II.)
INDIAN 00N-TRIBUTTON to home EPPBOTTVECHARGES of the british army.(previous reference:Cabinet 30(28)r Oon-conclusion 10.)2. The Secretary af State for India asked the Cabinet tc amend the Terms of Referenceas set forth in the Cabinet Conclusions ofthe Meeting referred to in the margin.    LordBirkenhead pointed out that, in a small but important particular, the Terms of Referenceto the Sub-Committee as stated by him appearedto have been misunderstood, namely, the thirdTerm of Reference, which should read:-sWhat powers could be exercised in the matter vis-a-vis theSecretary of SVate fo&apos;r&quot;&quot;India inCouncil&quot; , - rot &quot;vis-a-vis theGovernment o*f&quot;Yndia,rTHe pointed cut that it was the Council of indian London which constitutionally was in aposition to veto the proposals of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, on the one hand, and, on the other,of the Government of India, in respect of thecharges on the revenues of India.    Lord Birkenheadalso suggested that the opportunity should betaken to re-arrange the order and make someverbal alterations in the other two Terms ofReference for the purpose of making them conformmore closely to the problem to be considered as it now stands, which he suggested should read asfollows:-to consider and advise -(i) What powers could be exercised in the matte r vis-a-vis theSecretary of StoTEe rof&quot;indian Council.(il) On the question of principlehow the claim of the Govern-ment of India that there shouldbe no contribution by india should be dealt with.(ill) How the amount of the contri-bution, if any, should bede t e rmine d *-a-
After some discussion the Cabinet agreedThat the Cabinet Coionittee , composed as decided at the Meeting referredto in the margin, should meet withthe following Terms of Referencei-1o consider and advise -(i) On the question of principlewhether there should be aoontribution by India, and,if the decision is in the affirmative on the questionof principle, how the claim of the Government of india that there should be no con-tribution by India should bedealt with:(il) Whether the existing contribu-tion was equitable:(III) What powers could be exercised inthe matter yis-a&quot;--vis the Goverrsnentof India and the Secretary ofState for India in Council.
CHINA.. 3. The Secretary of State for War reported tothe Cabinet, as,a matter of urgency, the position(previous reference: which had arisen in the Kailan mining area in cabinet 30(28), Con- North China, where there are a number of Britishelusion 5.)subjects, in consequence of the withdrawal onMay 19th of American troops from Tons-shan.Suggestions had been made that British troops should take over this area.    The potentialmilitary commitments involved in the despatch ofa Battalion of British troops to take over the sector vacated by the Americans were such thatthis step could not be authorised.   A telegram tothis effect, giving reasons, had accordingly beensent by the Foreign Office to Sir Miles Lampsonon May 23rd (Telegram No. 133), in which instruc-tions had been given that all British subjectsresident in the italian- mining area were to beinformed that British troops would not be sentthere for their protection, in order that theynight have time to withdraw if they desired todo so.    Enquiry had then been made as -to whetherthe Japanese would take over the sector, but theyhad refused, for the same reasons.    The presentposition as reported by Sir Miles Lampson on june 5th (Peking Telegrams Nos. 555 and 556) wasthat, although the families of foreign employees,with the exception of two Belgian ladies, had left the Kailan area, the personnel remained *. &amp;ni, though safe at the moment, might be in danger;   that it was considered that it mightbe dangerous for them to evacuate unarmed, and
that they were unlikely to succeed in doing so if they made the attempt.    It was clear fromthese telegrams that Sir Miles Lampson had sent the necessary instructions to Tientsin and had repeated them on June 4th to make quite certainthat all British residents at the mines werewarned and had an opportunity of withdrawing,&quot;but that for some reason they had not beencarried out so far as the personnel of the mineswas concerned. Sir Miles Lamps on, however, had nowagain/instructed Tientsin that the proper course wasto notify British residents individually and direct of the position so that there could be nomisunderstanding as to the conditions under whichthe;/ remained..   Sir Laming tforthington-evans  said he was making enquiries as to whether there was anypracticable military plan of extricating those concerned.After discussion, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That if there was any practicablemilitary plan for- extricatinq- thepersons concerned, and the need was established, the British Ministerat Peking should be given power toauthorise action being taken:(b) That the Secretary   of State forWar should co-operate with theForeign Office in the drafting of atele prams to carry out this oolicy.-a-
ADEN. 4*  The Cabinet had before them the Report ofThe Question a Cabinet Committee (Paper CP.-175 (2,8)) on of Police.the question of the stops which should be taken(Previous to secure a police force at Aden, the ConclusionsReference:Cabinet 30 of which are summarised in the last parapraph of(28) , Con-elusion 8.) the Report as follows: -(a) It is most important that theBritish Battalion now at Aden-should be withdrawn at theearliest possible moment;   butthis cannot be done until a reasonably efficient armed police force of adequate strength is available.(b) The cheapest method of raising-a police force in Aden is bylocal recruitment;   and theChief of the Air Staff is con-vinced that , with British Officers ,an efficient force can be raised in-this way.    On the other hand,looal opinion at present avail-able is&apos;  practically unanimousthat an efficient force cannotbe formed out of local material.In these circumstances a finaldecision on the possibility of recruiting personnel locallyought not&apos;to be taken untilColonel Symes (Resident-designateof Aden) is in a position to make recommendations.(c) The urgency of the question shouldbe impressed on Colonel Symesbefore his departure;    and everyeffort should be made to ensurehis arrival at Aden at the earliestpossible moment.   He should be instructed to submit full re commend -ations as to all the steps whichshould be taken to secure an efficient police force at Aden,as soon as possible   and in anycase not later than six weeks  after his arrival.(d) The Government of India should be pressed immediately to make availableone or two British Officers of theIndian Police, to be sent to Adento reorganise and train the existingpolice force.(e) All possible arrangements to meetthe c ontingenoy oiloc a1 re c ruitment,or , a It e rnat iv e ly, o f re c ruitme ntin India, should be preconcerted b:the Departments concerned, in con-suit ation with each other and with
trie Government of India, inorder that, immediate action may &quot;be taken on Colonel S;yiaeslr e c om&amp; ndations.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the Report of the CabinetOouaaittea, the Conclusions of whichare stated above, and to proceed inaccordance therewith:(b) To take note of a statement by theSecretary of State for Air emphasizingthe urgency of the matter if the economies anticipated from the transferof Aden to the Royal Air Force wereto be achieved this year.
JAPANESE AIR 5. Hie Cabinet had before them the followingBASS AT FORMOSAAW BRITISH Papers relating to the Japanese Air Base atAIR BASE at hong-KONG. Formosa and the British Air Base at Hong-Kong(Paper C.P.-176 (28)):-(previous reference: A Memorandum by the SecretaryCabinet 39 of State for Air, covering a(25) , Con- Memorandum by the Air&apos; Staffelusion 5.) (C.I.D. Paper No.311-c):An Extract from the Minutesof the 235th Meeting of theCommittee of Imperial Defencecontaining the following recommendations:-(a) That no protest should be rodeat the present time against theestablishment of a Japanese airbase at Formosa.(b) That the development of an airbase at Hong-Kong was not likelyto raise difficulties at thepresent time as the Japanese hadacquiesced in   its establishmentas an emergency measure during, the present abnormal situationin China, wThich might continue for some time.(c) That, apart from this temp ore r:/Justification of our action, thedevelopment of a base on the mainland, not specifically forcoast defence, but for purposesof defence apainst landward attack,can be defended as constituting noinfringement of the Washington&quot;Treaty.(d) That if, at some future date,protests were raised and the matter were taken before a Court of Arbitra-tion, it would be right for us to protest at the seme time againstthe establishment of a Japaneseair base at Formosa.(e) That on this understanding thepolicy of the establishment of an air Base at Hong-Kong should be approved.The Cabinet approved the above recom-menda-tions of the Committee of ImperialDefence.
HONG-KONG COAST 6. The Cabinet had before them the followingDEFENCES.Papers relating to the Coast Defences of Hong-(previous reference: Kong  (Paper CP.-177  (28)):-Cabinet 39(25),  Con- A Report by the Chiefs of Staffelusion 5.) Sub-Committee of the Committeeof Imperial Defence  (C.I.D.  PaperNo.319-0):An extract from the Minutes  ofthe 235th Meeting of the Committeeof Imperial Defence containing the following Conclusion:-&quot;The Committee of Imperial defence agreed :-(a) That,  in their opinion,  the arguments advanced in the report by the Chiefsof Staff (C.I.D. Paper No. 319-C)would sufficiently justify the conversion of the coast defencegun mountings at Hong-Kong;    and(b) To recommend to the Cabinet thatthe proposal to convert the gun mountings with a view to increasing their elevation should be approved in principle&quot;.The Cabinet approved the above recommenda-tions of the Committee of Imperial Defence,
THE BASIS OP 7. The Cabinet had before them the followina-ARMY ESTIMATES.documents relating to the Strength and Organisa-The Strength and organisation of      tion of the Cavalry of the Line (Paper C*P. -178the Cavalry ofthe Line. (28)):-A Report by Lord Salisbury&apos;s(Previous Sub-Committee of the CommitteeReference: of imperial Defence, which had cabinet 56 been aooointed on the recommenda-(27), Con- tion of the Cabinet at the Meetingelusion 6.) referred to in the margin (C.I.n.Paper No.872-B) :An Extract from the Minutes ofthe 235th Meeting of the Committeeof Imperial Defence containing thefollowing Conclusions:-&quot;The Committee of Imperial Defence  (a) Agreed to recommend to the Cabinetthat approval should be given tothe Report of Lord Salisbury&apos;s Sub-Committee, the conclusions ofwhich were as follows:-&apos; 1. Leaving out of account thepossibility of a reduction of theBritish Cavalry in India, whichis outside our reference, fromthe point of view of economy weare unable on the evidence thathas been laid before us torecommend any change in theorganisation of the mounted armwhich would produce a saving.2. We recommend that the WarOffice policy (see paragraph XIIIabove)5 both in the conversionof Cavalry Regiments into armoured car Regiments&apos;and in the pro-gressive mechanization of the machine-gun. equipment andtransport of the remainingOavalvy Regiments, should be approved.3. We would draw particular attention to the desirability,as increased mechanization becomespossible, of making the fullest use of the traditions of the cavalry and of the spirit and special qualities of its personnel in its mechanized substitute.4. Recognizing the capital cost involved in the-full develop-ment of mechanization, we recommendation-mend that the change should be ^made with due regard to financial considerations. &apos;
(b) Took note that the Secretaryof State for Air wished to be associated with the Chancellorof the Exchequer in the remarksadded by the latter to the Report.&quot;The Cabinet approved the Report ofLord Salisbury11 s Sub-Committee, theConclusions of which are summarised above, and took note of the followingremarks by the Chancellor of theExchequer, in which the Secretary ofState for Air concurs. -&quot;I am in full agreement with the policy adopted by the War Office of usingCavalry persormel to operate mechanicalvehicles.    I am content with the stepthat has   been taken in mechanisingtwo Cavalry Regiments, etc , so faras this financial year is concerned,but I consider that further measures should be taken as rapidly as possibleto furnish the British Cavalry withan equipment suitable to modern war.I hold most strongly that furthertransformations of horse soldiers arerequired in the interests primarilyof war efficiency, but also for the economies resulting from the elniiina-tion of redundant units.In these circumstances I regret thatI find myself unable to sigxi a report which would associate me either withacquiescence in the present militaryview, or in any suggestion that progress towards mechanisation should not be&apos;asrapid as we can possibly afford&quot;.
WIRELESSBROADCASTING.The Broad-casting of controversy.(previous reference:Cabinet 29(28), Con-clusion 1.)8. The Cabinet had before them a ^letterfrom the Chairman of the Conservative andUnionist Party to the Prime Minister, dated the24th May, 1928 (Paper CP.-174 (28)) ,reporting that the British Broadcasting Corporation hadsummoned a oonference on the subject of the broadcasting of controversy;   that at thatconferenoe the Liberals had maintained their objections to the British Broadcasting Corpora-tion proposals;   that, acting upon the instruc-tions of the Cabinet, he himself and the chief whip had refused to give way, with the resultthat no agreement had been reached;   thatsubsequently the British Broadcasting Corpora-tion had made the further proposal that between now arid the end&apos;of the year (apart from threeinaugural speeches) there should be threeGovernment occasions and two each for the other two Parties and that the situation should be reviewed early in January without prejudice to anything which may have happened this year;that he and the Chief Whip agreed that thisproposal ought to be rejected, and urged very strongly that they should be given authority bythe Cabinet to adhere to the previous decision.Attached to Mr J.CC.Davidson1s letter was adraft of the reply which he suggested should besent in answer to the enquiry from tho british broadcasting Corporation,
In the course of a short discussion it waspointed out that the logical result of the line taken, by the Liberal Party would he that the more the Opposition in the House of Commons was dividedthe greater would be the facilities given to it bythe British Broadcasting Corporation, aid theless relatively would be the facilities availableto the Government on whom the responsibility forthe conduct of affairs rested.The Cabinet agreed  That the original proposal of theBritish Broadcasting Corporation,that the Government should be given time for time with the other two parties, except during the periodof a General Election, was accept-able, but that no other proposal could be agreed to;    and that ahint should be given privately to the appropriate authority inthe British Broadcasting Corpora-tion that if any other course wasdeci(-3u on the permission for the broadcasting of controversy wouldbe witMfawn.
THE PLACING 3. The Cabinet had &quot;before them a JfeiaorandumOF WREATHSON FOREIGN WAR      by the First Lord of the Admiralty, theMEMORIALS.Secretary of State for War and the Secretaryof State for Air (Paper CP.-173 (28)) repre-senting that the time had now come whenprobably in all the countries involved inthe Great War the general feeling would be infavour of discontinuing the practice of placing wreaths on foreign war memorials and official participation in all such ceremoniesabroad;    suggesting that November 11, 1928,the tenth anniversary of the Armistice, shouldbe the last occasion of such participation; and proposing that this country should take theinitiative now   and   propose through diplomatic channels that a definite agreement on theselines should be reached between all the allied and associated countries.The question was postponed untilthe First Lord of the admiralty and the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs could be present.
10. The Cabinet had before them a. Memorandumby the President of the Board of Trade (paper cp.-172 (28)) covering the Report of aCommittee appointed under the Safeguarding ofIndustries Procedure to enquire into an application for a Duty on enamelled hollow-ware.In accordance with the finding of the Committeethe President of the Board of Trade, in his memorandum, recommended that the Cabinet shouldapprove the inclusion of a Duty of 25 per cent.on raw enamelled hollow-wars for a period offive years in this year&apos;s Finance Bill;    thatthe Duty should come into force as soon aspossible after the necessary Ways and Meansresolution has been introduced;    and proposing to publish the Report of the Committee, inaccordance with the established practice, just before the introduction of the resolution.The President of the Board of trade informed the Cabinet that there had been threeInquiries into this question.    As the result ofthe first Inquiry a Duty had been imposed;   asthe result of the second it had been taken off;and now the Duty was again recommended.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the inclusion of a Dutyof 25 per cent, on saw^enamelled wvowkehollow-ware for a period of fiveyears in this year1s Finance Bill:(b) That the necessary Resolutionshould be moved on Friday next,June 8th.
RUSSIA.(Previoust, Reference:Cabinet 11(28) , Con-clusion 7.)11. In the absence of the Home secretary the Prime Minister read to the Cabinet a state-ment which Sir William Joyn son-Hicks proposedto make in the House of Commons on the following day in regard to the use of Russian Banks forgiving: financial support to Communist bodies inthis country.The Cabinet approved the statements butasked the Prime Minister to draw the attentionof the Home Secretary, before he made his state-ment, to the desirability of&apos; avoiding, in answer to Supplementary Questions, iiaiting any promisesto take action against the Banks conceined.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,June 6, 1928.-
appendix: i.Cypher telegram to His Majesty !s Consul (Geneva).Foreign Office, 5th June,  1923.  10.-30 p.m*No.40.IMMEDIATE.Your telegram No.56 L.N,  (of June 3rd).Following for Secretary of State from Lord Oushendun.Aft:r conversation to-day with First Sea Lord I have arranged for him to attend Cabinet tomorrow.     MeantimeAdmiralty comment on your interview with M. briand is contained in following minute handed to me &quot;by Sir CharlesMadden.Begins ,The Admiralty suggest that we are on unsound ground ifwe agree Pith the French that the length of the lines ofcommunication should form the basis for estimating cruiserstrengths.      The statement that such a basis  is at the rootof the arguments of ourselves and United States is notcorrect.     We have always maintained that the length ofthe lines is only one, and not the most important, of the.factors.      Other factors are the vital nature and volumeof the trade and the geograpical position of the route.It is not clear farther from Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos;telegram what the French mean by lines of communication.It Is Important to be certain of this.     Do they mean thelines of communication along which the whole trade of thecountry passes, such lines going to foreign as well ascolonial ports or do they mean the lines of communicationonly to overseas possessions?      If the latter it islikely to raise serious resistance both from America andItaly and if we accepted it we. should find ourselvesaligned with France against these: two countries and basingourselves on an argument most difficult to justify.
The former definition is considered the trueone but Is probably not that intended by Pranceas thereby she would obtain no advantage over italy in relative cruiser strengths.     Ends.

First Sec Lord elaboratedview of Admiralty expressed in minute contained inmy telegram No.40.      Cabinet felt that withoutknowing precisely what French mean by lines ofcommunication it is Impossible to decide whetherBriand&apos;s suggestion can be accepted as basis   forestimating cruiser strengths.
