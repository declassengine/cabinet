(Apportionment) Bill, but the cabinet were given to understand that this had been omitted from the draft cir-culated as it would be necessary to treat the question of Rating relief in the King&apos;s Speech from a widerpoint of view, and the Minister ofHealth&apos;s paragraph could best be incorporated with material to be furnished by the Chancellor of theExchequer.This matter was left for incor-poration later after consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequeand the Minister of Health.The passage relating to AGRICULTUREat the bottom of page 4, should be divided into two and the orderreversed, that is to say, therechould first be a paragraph relatingto the provision of AgriculturalCredit Facilities, with a subsequentparagraph referring to Grading andMarking of Agricultural Produce.THE COMPANIES&apos; BILL.

In the course of the discussion referredto in the preceding Conclusion,  the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs observed that, from apolitical point of view, he considered that some reduction might be made in the strength of thegarrison in Egypt.The Cabinet felt that they could not proceed further with this suggestion until the military aspects of the question were before them, and agreed -That the Secretary of State forWar should circulate a militaryappreciation on the possibilityand desirability of reducing thegarrison of Egypt.
rotUCTTTON and ? .The Cabinet bad before them the Report of imitation of armaments. the Lord Privy Seal&apos;a Cabinet Committee on Policyin the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments(previous reference: (Paper CP.-253 (28)) containing recommendationsCabinet 39(28), Con- which, may be summarised as follows r-cluaion 19.)(i) Limitation of Naval Armaments.The French proposals (July, 1928)for the limitation of naval anna-ments may be accepted as a satis-factory compromise between theBritish and French views.(ii) The Secretary of State for Foreign-Affairs should intimate to the french ambassador that the proposals are acceptable to Great Britain and thata formal acknowledgement to this effect will be given as soon asthey are formally received fromthe French Government.(iii)  The proposals should then be commu-communicated to the Governments of theUnited States of America, Japan, andItaly as constituting a compromisejointly arrived at between the Britishand French Governments.(iv) .M. Louden, the President of thePreparatory Commission at Geneva,should be informed privately by theForeign Secretary that the conversa-tions on Naval Armaments between GreatBritain and France had been broughtto a successful issue and that so faras this question is concerned thereis no need to. delay farther the next meeting of the Preparatory Commission,(v)  The German Proposals for publicity should only be accepted in so faras &quot;Effectives&quot; (Tables I to IX) andMilitary Programmes are concerned,provided that information in regardto the latter is confined to thatwhich is normally presented to Parlia-roent.In order to enable the British Repre-sentative at Geneva to be provided with all the technical arguments whichcan be adduced against Tables X to XIV,the Fighting Departments should.be instructed to draw up Memoranda forhis gxiidance.(vi) That the Model Treaty to strengthen the Mea.ns, of Preventing..War., onaccount of xts vague language and
imperfections of drafting, is not one which, the Committee could everrecommend for adoption by HisMajesty&apos;s Government.    The PolicyCommittee should be empowered,without further reference to theCabinet, to draft criticisms onthis Model for the guidance of theBritish Representative at Geneva.(vii) The Scheme for financial Assistanceto States Victims of Aggression.The Cabinet should instruct theDepartments concerned (the treasury and Foreign Office) to submit theirviews to the Cabinet Committee on policy in sufficient time for their consideration before the Recess, andthe Cabinet Committee should beempowered, without further referenceto the Cabinet unless such a course should seem to the Cabinet Committeeto be necessary, to draft instructionfor the guidance of the British Repre-sentativd when this question comes upfor consideration by the Assembly in geneva.(viii) As regards the Private Manufacture ofArms.,  that the Report of the Sub-Committee of the Committee of ImperialDefence, attached as Appendix II to cp.-253 (28), should be approved asthe basis of the instructions of theBritish Representative at Geneva when this Convention comes up for consider-ation.   In particular, the CabinetCommittee endorsed the principle setout in the second paragraph of theReport, which governed the principalrecommendations covered therein, that&quot;the provision of any Convention inregard to the private manufacture ofarms should also be applied to themanufacture of simil     articlescarried out in State-owned or State-controlled factories..............and that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould only agree to adhere to theConvention on the express under-standing that its provisions are applicable also to State manufacture&quot;.In the course of the discussion the lord privy Seal explained to the Cabinet that the french proposals in regard to Capital Ships and aircraft carriers were in general agreement with the viewshitherto adopted by the British Government.
As regards Cruisers, the French proposal wasthat surface vessels of or below 10,000 tonsarmed with guns of more than 6-inch, and up to-inch calibre should be subjected to a maximumtonnage, that is to say, a universal parityfixed for all Powers, but within this maximumlimit each Power would indicate at the finalConference for each category the tonnage they proposed to reach and which they would undertake not to exceed during the period covered by theConvention, that is to say, five years.   Cruisersmounting 6-inch guns and below would not belimited.   Similar arrangements would apply asregards ocean-going submarines, that is to say,submarines of over 600   tons, but submarinesbelow this tonnage would not be limited, - onthe theory that they were defensive in character.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,referring to the proposal that a communication should be made to M. Louden, the President of thePreparatory Commission at Geneva, asked that inany event this might not be done without priorcommunication of the proposals to the UnitedStates of America and Japan.The Lord Privy Seal undertook toamend the Report to meet theChancellor of the Duchy of lancaster&apos;s point.In regard to the Model Treaty for Strengthen-ing the Means of Pr even ting War, the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster informed the Cabinetthat at an early stage of the proceedings atGeneva he had raised the question of the status of this Treaty, with the result that, instead of becoming a Protocol open/or the signature of all
nations, it had become merely a Treaty thatmight be adopted as a model for bi-lateral orother Treaties between particular Powers,    Inthese circumstances there was no question ofthis Treaty being adopted by Great Britain.Nevertheless, he had not refrained from criticising and securing amendments in the Treaty .The Cabinet agreed  (a) The French proposals for thelimitation of Naval armamentsshould be approved, and theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be responsiblefor the diplomatic arrangementsfor communicating them to theforeign Governments concernedprior to their discussion atGeneva:(b) The German Proposals for publicity should only be accepted in so faras &quot;Effectives&quot; (Tables I to IX)and Military Programmes are con-cerned, provided that information in regard to the latter is confined to that which is normally presented to Parliament,The First Lord of the Admiralty,the Secretary of State for Warand the Secretary of State forAir should instruct their respective departments to draw up, for the guidance of the British Representa-tive at Geneva, Memoranda setting forth the technical arguments against Tables X to XXV:(c) As regards the Model &quot;Treaty toStrengthen the Means of PreventingWar, the Policy Committee shouldbe empowered, without further refer-ence to the Cabinet, to draftcriticisms for the guidance of theBritish Representative at Geneva.Lord Cushendun, however, should begiven full discretion as to whether he used the material furnished bythe Cabinet Committee or kept silence.The Chancellor of the Duchy was asked,in the event of the Treaty undergoingfurther criticism, not to commit himself in his criticisms so far asto involve any risk of his being pressed to sign it:(d) As regards the Scheme for Financial,Assistance to States Vic tlms ,,qfAggression,    the Treasury&quot;and Foreign
Office should subir.it their views to the Cabinet Committee on Policyin sufficient time for their con-sideration before the Recess, andthe Cabinet Committee should beempowered, without further referenceto the Cabinet unless such a course should seem to them to be necessary,to draft instructions for the guidanceof the British Representative when this question comes up for considera-tion by the Assembly in Geneva:(e) As regards the Private Majmufactureof Arms, to approve the Report ofthe Sub-Committee of the Committeeof Imperial Defence, attached as appendix II to C.P.-253 (.28)) as thebasis of the instructions of theBritish Representative at Genevawhen this Convention comes up forconsideration, subject to thefollowing:-(i) Further consideration by theCabinet Committee -on Policyof the 3rd, 4th and 5thparagraphs of the Preamble,on which the First Lord ofthe Admiralty expressed some doubts:(ii) That the Convention should notbe ratified by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in Great Britainuntil the other countrieswhich are the principalpro due er s of arms, ammunit ionand implements of war have ...ratified.
MILITARY CON-TRIBUTIONS BYCOLONIAL ANDOTHER GOVERN-MENTS.(previous reference:Cabinet 60(27), Con-elusion 5.)8.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies (paper cp.-207 (28)) reporting the progress of thenegotiations with Bermuda and Jamaica on thesubject of certain recommendations of a CabinetCommittee on Military Contributions of colonial and other Governments (Paper C .P.-298 (27)), which negotiations had resulted from the Cabinet decisionreferred to in the margin.    The purport of theSecretary of State&apos;s recommendation is summarised in the last paragraph of his Memorandum, as follows:-&quot;As it is practically certain that neither Colony will agree to theseproposals and that the only resultof asking them to do so in officialDespatches to be laid before theirLegislatures would be to create abad political atmosphere and greatlyadd to the difficulty of the refe-tions of the Colonial governments with the unofficial elements in bothLegislatures, I trust the cabinet will agree to proceed no further with the matter&quot;.In the course of the discussion, thequestion was raised as to what was the strategicaljustification for  the maintenance of garrisonsat Jamaica and Bermuda, and the Cabinet agreed:-(a) That the Committee of ImperialDefence should be asked to considerwhether it was necessary to retain^J^^any garrisons in Jamaica andBermuda;(b)  That the question of the ColonialMilitary Contributions should be adjourned until the Report of theCommittee of Imperial Defence is available.
jrflE factories bill.(previous reference:Cabinet 4(28), Con-clusxon 5(d) .)9.

It would generally
be agreed that In- the present conditions thefirst duty of the Government was to deal with unemployment, and this could not be done without devotin?; much time to the necessary legislation.In these circumstances the cabinet agreed -That the introduction of the factories Bill should be post-poned, but an intimation shouldbe given that it would remainIn the forefront of the presentGovernmentTs policy for taefuture.

The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the Debt on the UnemploymentFund:-A Memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (Paper CP .-244 (28)),drawing attention to the effectof the increase in unemploymenton the Unemployment Fund, whichwas likely to necessitate theintroduction of a Bill to increasethe borrowing powers, possibly atthe beginning of the next Sessionof Parliament:A Memorandum by the President ofthe Board of Education&apos;(paper c.P.-251 (28)) containing sugges-tions for temporarily taking thecoal-mining industry out of theUnemployment Insurance Fund alto-gether.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked the Cabinet to note that the Treasury werenot in agreement with the proposals containedin the Memorandum by the President of theBoard of Education.The Cabinet agreed -To consider the matter afresh imme-diately after the Recess.
THE INTER- -national labour CON-PERENCE -NINTH SESSION,(previous reference:Cabinet 57(27), Con-elusion IS.)12. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Minister of Labour (Paper C.P.-246 (28))containing proposals, drawn up in consultation with,the Board of Trade, as to the action to be takenby the Government in regard to the Draft Conven-tions and Recommendations adopted by the Inter-national Labour Conference which was held at Geneva in June, 1926.In regard to the Draft Convention concerningSeamen^ Articles of Agreementt it was proposedto inform the International Labour Office   of    theobjections taken by British shipowners and seamento Article 5, which provides that the document tobe issued to every seaman, containing a record ofhis employment on board the vessel, should not contain any statement as to the quality of the3eaman&apos;s work, and stating that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be prepared to ratify the Conventionbut for this provision, which, in view of thepreference shown by both sides of the industry for the existing system, it was not prepared toadopt.In regard to the Draft Convention concerning:the Repatriation of Seamen, it was proposed thatHis Majesty&apos;.s Government should intimate that it isprepared to ratify the Draft Convention as soon asat least six of the other principal Maritime Powersalso are prepared to ratify.In regard to the Recommendation c oneerningthe Repatriation of Masters and Apprentices, it was proposed to inform the Seeretarcy-General of theLeague of Nations that the question of introducing legislation to provide for the only point not covered by   existing legislation, namely, the
extension of&quot; the provisions concerning repatriationto Masters, would be considered when a suitable opportunity arises .As regards the Recommendation concerning theGeneral Principles for the Inspection of the Condi-tjons of Vvbrk of Searoen.pt  was proposed to informthe Secretary-General of the League of nations that His J&amp;jesty*s Government accepts..The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs suggested that in the particular case of the DraftConvention concerning 3earnenT s Articles of Agree-ment the most convenient course might perhaps beto depart from our usual custom and to ratifysubject to a reservation on Article 5.In the course of the discussion an alternative course was suggested, namely, that we should enactthe necessary legislation omitting the pointcovered by Article 5 of the Convention, and thennotify the International Labour Office of thecourse adopted .The question was adjourned in orderthat the President of the Board ofTrade and the Minister of Labourmight consider these suggestions in the light of previous experience.

In the meanwhile he asked for the approval of theCabinet to the Report of the Inter-Depart-mental Committee (CP. 106 (28)), which hadbeen held over pending the proposed enquiry on the larger question.The Cabinet agreed -Subject to the Chancellor of theExchequer finding no objections froma financial point of view, to approve the Report of the Inter-DepartmentalCommittee in regard to the employmentof ex-Sorvice men, contained in cp. 106 (28).
