ib untiedStates opWhe Multi-later alTreaty.(previous reference:Cabinet 35(88), Oon-elusion 1.)1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that M. Briand had authorised the French Legal Adviser, M. Fromageot, to proceedto Eerlin to hold conversations there on thesubject of the proposed Multilateral Treaty with herr Gauss, the German Legal Adviser, who hadbeen unable to proceed to Geneva owing to thechange of Government and the absence of his minister for Foreign Affairs from Berlin.   Theproposed conversations were of importance, becauseHerr Gauss was understood to have advised theGerman Government that they could accept thelatest version of Mr Kellogg&apos;s proposals withoutany breach of their obligations, whereas Sir CecilHurst and M. Fromageot had advised theirrespective Governments that the terms of theTreaty did not oover their obligations under theCovenant o^ the League of Nations and Articles 42to 44 of the Treaty of Versailles.   M. Fromageot,however, was most reluctant to proceed to Berlinwithout Sir Cecil Hurst.   The question on which sir Austen Chamberlain wished to consult theCabinet was as to whether he should authoriseSir Cecil Hurst to proceed to Berlin.    The meeting would be bound to attract public notice, and itwas necessary to consider what would be the reaction of such a meeting in the United States of Americaand in the Dominions.   In this connection Sir austen chamberlain called attention to telegrams (Mr.Chilton, Washington, June 26th, unnumbered, andthe Secretary of State for External Affairs,Canada, No .144, of June 30th) indicating that theCanadian Government thought that we were refraining
from unconditional assent to the Acs eric anproposals out of loyalty to the French.   Thiswas a complete misconception.   We were mostdesirous that the French should come into the multilateral Pact, but the present delay was inorder to ascertain whether our own rights and obligations under existing Treaties were affected&apos; The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairswhile agreeing that some of the Dominions were inclined to be restive at the delay in replying to the American proposals,  did not consider thatthe situation would be seriously aggravated bya visit by Sir Cecil Hurst to Berlin.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should have full discretion to authorise Sir (CecilHurst to accompany M, Fromageotto Berlin for a discussion with herr Gauss:(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should send a ^telegram&apos; to the British Charge&apos;d&apos;Affaires at Washington author-ising him to inform the Canadianrepresentative that the delay wasnot due to our loyalty to the Frenchbut to our concern with British and imperial interests and obligations:(c) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should considerthe desirability of adding to his telegram referred to in (b) a passageexplaining the reason for the proposedconversation between the Legal Advisersof the British, French and german governments, as well as whether itwould be desirable for the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs tosend an explanatory telegram on thispoint to the Dominions.
2. In reply to a request for information asto the present position in regard to the decisionof the Cabinet on the subject of Disarmamentquoted in the margin, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs informed his colleagues that,in accordance with the decision of the Cabinet,he had instructed Lord Crewe to communicate withM * Briand in regard to the proposal made by theFrench Representative on the Preparatory Commis-sion of the League of Nations, unofficially andwithout authority, in a private conversationwith Admiral Kelly.   Lord Grewe had been told to inform the French Government that although these proposals would not give us all that we desired, nevertheless they were recognised tobe a great advance on the previous attitude ofthe French Government, and that if the FrenchGovernment would put them forward officially weshould support them and that in these cireum-stances we should uinelactalLe uufr to opgoro theFrench point of view in regard to the exclusion of Reserves from the limitation of land armaments.The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the Cabinet that Admiral Kelly had had anotherconversation with, the French Naval Representative,who had informed him that the Ministry of Marinewere not opposed to the proposal, but that he understood there were political objections.Sir Austen Chamberlain was not unhopeful,in these circumstances, of so: e response to hisintervention on political grounds.    On the occasion of M. Berthelofs recent visit to London he had
discussed the matter and impressed on him theawkwardness of the position which would arisewith Germany if no progress could be made inthe matter of Disarmament.
FRANCE. 3. A short discussion took place inft Effects regard to the consequences of the Frenchn-e the Stab-^lisation of measures for the stabilisation of the Franc,ne Franc .one of which was tantamount to a repudiation of loans given to France by this country duringthe War and to which the public had been stronglyencouraged to subscribe by the British Government.
4. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Pensions (Paper C.P.-208 (28))in which he proposed a permanent stabilisation of present rates of pension and other allowances and grants so far as they are expressed to be dependant on the cost of living, accompanied by certain conditions to safeguard our future liability-ity .While the Cabinet inclined favourablytowards the proposals of the Minister of Pensionsand congratulated Major Tryon on his courageousand tactful administration of pensions, theMinisters at the head of the Service Departmentsashed for further time to examine the effect ofthe proposals on post-War Service Pensions, etc.The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked theService Ministers to bear in mind the different footing of Great War pensions from post-Warpensions, but entered a caveat that the generalagreement which he had expressed at the outset of the Meeting in favour of the proposals inC.P.-208 (28) had been on the understanding thatthey would not react so as to produce additional expenditure in the Service Departments, and his assent was subject to review if such increase was likely to take place.The Minister of Pensions asked the Cabinetto remember that, whereas the Great War pensionshad remained constant for some years, the service pension arrangements had been changed. - There wasconsequently no fixed relation between them.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Treasury should summon a Conference with representatives
of the Ministry of Pensions andthe Service Departments to examine whether the proposals of theMinister of Pensions must necessarily have any reaction on the pensionarrangements of the Service Depart-ments:   .(b) That the Oabinet decision once.-208 (28) should be reservedpending the Report of the aboveConferTice and of any subsequentconversation between the ministers concerned which might become neces-sary or desirable:(c) That if the Minister of pensions should find himself compelled by parliamentary exigencies to makea statement before the aboveInquiries were completed, he should at once report to the Prime minister with a view to an early decision.-7-
the unemployment:situation.OYMENTReport of theIndustrialTransferenceBoard.(previous reference:Cabinet 55(28), Con-clusion 3,)oversea settlement.(previous reference:Cabinet 9(28),  Con-clusion 7 .)5. The Cabinet had before there the following memoranda on the subject of the unemployment situation:-A Memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (Paper CP,-206 (28))covering the Report of theIndustrial Transference Boardand proposing to authorisepublication at the end of theweek:A Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs(Paper CP.-210 (28)) advocating,as a remedy for the present diffi-cult unemployment situation, givingour industries some measure of shelter in the home market andspreading the burden of ourtaxation so as to cover all thegoods that are sold in that market,combinea with Imperial Preference:A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs (paper cp .-19 8 (28)) covering a Memo -randum by the Oversea SettlementCommittee showing what can be done to relieve the situation by meansof oversea settlement, and at whatcost.   In this Memorandum it waspointed out that it should bepossible to settle overseas eachyear 7,000 single miners, 2,500miners with families  (say 10,000souls), 2,500 boys and 2,000single women, or 21,500 souls inall, at a total net cost of 601,000 or just under  28 per head, in addition to recoverableexpenditure of  300,000 a year asfrom 1930 and capital expenditureof  3,000,000 for land developmentpurposes spread over 30 years.These sums were compared in theMemorandum with  85,000,000 per year stated to have been spenton relief of unemployment sincethe Armistice;A Memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (Paper CP.-211 (28)) statingthat a Question had been put down inthe House of Commons challenging thepolicy which had been adopted by theMinister of Labour, as a specialmeasure in view of the unemploymentin the coalfields, of endeavouringto place some of the miners inemployment (in small numbers) inthe more prosperous areas, eventhough suitable local applicantsmight have been found.   This policybeing- in accordance with the
r^coTnroend-crtri^ms o i  Kher&quot; Tttdtrs-trrta 1Transference Board, Sir Arthur SteeL--Maitland proposed in his memorandum that the answer to the question should state plainly what wasbeing done and should justify itas the only proper course to take in view of the circumstances ofthe distressed mining areas andthe relative prosperity of otherparts of the country.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs made a statement to the Cabinet in the course ofwhich he asked for:-(i) Acceptance in principle of therecommendations on the subject of oversea Settlement contained- *in CP.-198 (28):(ii) Amendment, if possible beforeParliament rises and, if not, inthe Autumn, of the Empire Settle-ment Act so as to enable the above recommendations to be carried out under the Act:(iii) The appointment of a Board under lord Lovat, Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Dominion Affairs, asa whole-time Chairman, with twopermanent members (to securecontinuity of policy), one todeal with finance and the otherwith organisation,  and with twounpaid Members of Parliament fromopposite sides of the Bouse:(iv) That all these matters should besettled, as far as they can be,subject to negotiation on thematter with the Dominion Govem-ments before Lord Lovat leaves for canada at the end of July, and that lord Lovat should be accompaniedby a member of the Treasury staff.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointedout that the proposals of the Industrial Trans fer-ence Board, as well as those of the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs, did not touch theimmediate problem confronting the Government,;which was, how to provide for some 300,000persons most of whom were already unemployed and the remainder likely to be unemployed in
the near future.   He suggested that the cabinet should examine a proposal for an addition tothe Scheme of Rating Relief whereby relief wouldbe given to the railways in respect of coal,either for exportation or for use in blastfurnaces.   This scheme, which might come intooperation early in the Autumn, should have animmediate effect on those industries which werehardest hit.   The cost was estimated at  4,000,000but sore of this might be recoverable by reducedexpenditure on unemployment, increased receipts from Income Tax and Super Tax, and in otherindirect ways resulting from the stimulation ofindustry.   Mr Churchill emphasized the iropossi-bility of financing measures for dealing with unemployment without additional taxation,  thenature of which he indicated and which he thoughtth^ Cabinet was unlikely to desire before aGeneral Election, or,  alternatively, by means of savings, postponements of expenditure on approvedpolicy,  etc., which he commended to his colleaguesA third proposal which it was suggested theCabinet ought to consider was one for a reductionIn the cost of fares for emigrants, which mightstimulate emigration apart, from State-aidedschemes,  and which would enable emigrants toreach, the Dominions without the restrictions which, according to the Report of the industrial transference Eoard, exercised a deterrent effectp.n emigration.After considerable discussion the Cabinet
if ij(a) That the Report of the industrial transference Board, together withthe various proposals made to theCabinet, should be considered inthe first instance by the Committeewhich had considered the Govern-menfs Rating Reform Policy, towhich should be added the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs andthe Minister of Labour.    The compo-sition of the Committee, therefore,would be as follows:-The Chancellor of the Exchequer(in the Chair),The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for Scotland,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Health,The Minister of Agriculture andFisheries,The President of the Board oft Education,The Minister of Labour.(b) That the above Committee should proceed with its enquiries withthe least possible delay, with aview to a farther discussion bythe Oabinet within the next week or two .(c) That in the meantime the Report ofthe Industrial Transference board should not be published.(d) That the Minister of Labour shouldbe authorised, to reply to theQuestion put in the House of commons as proposed in CP .- 11 ( 8).
THE racecourse betting BILL.(Previou a reference:Cabinet 35(88), Con-elusion 8 .)6.   A snort discussion took place &quot;in regardto the Racecourse Betting Bill, and the cabinet were informed that proposals had been made forreferring it to a Select Committee, and th$t the leader of the Labour Party in the House ofCommons had suggested that the Speaker shouldrule the further stages out of order.     the speaker was to give his decision the same day.The Cabinet agreed  That the question should be discussed between the Prime Minister,  theChancellor of the Exchequer andthe Home Secretary on the following morning after the Speaker had givenhis ruling as to whether thefurther stages of the Bill werein order.-IS-
THE indian statutory commission.(previous previous reference:Cabinet 35(28),  Con-conclusion 7.)7.The Cabinet had before them a copy of telegrams exchanged between the Viceroy andthe Secretary of State for India (Paper CP.-209(28)) on the subject of the reservation ofthe right of the Commission to take evidence in camera.    In the latter it was stated thatthe Indian Statutory Copmrission had decided todraw no distinction between its own members and members of the Committee in respect of examinationof witnesses and access to documentary evidence,and that the reservation made in Sir John Simon&apos;sletter to the Viceroy of February 6th could be adequately secured by the power of the Chairmanto protect any witnesses and by his discretionarypower to exclude the Press from the joint sittingswhen necessary.The Cabinet took note of the abovetelegrams.-13-
ARMS TRAFFIC 6. The Cabinet took note that the PrimeCONVENTION.Minister has asked the Chancellor of the Duchy(Previous of Lancaster to act as British Represent at ive -Reference:Cabinet 23 on the Special Comrrission of the League of(25), Con-clusion 6.)
