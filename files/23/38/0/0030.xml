flBffiOVmy)    ^ 1116 chancellor*smaller of the Exchequer informed the Confer^-ILi*- ence that there were three big questions of principle arisingHffe *able for out of the amendments to the German Reparation (Recovery)o Pill.Bill on which a decision was required, and a decision wasalso needed on the question of. the time to be allotted tothe Bill in the House of Commons,   Aa regards the questionof time, he felt that it. would not be possible to take allthe remaining stages of the Bill in the House of Commonstoday.    There had been considerable opposition to the pro-posal to rush the Bill through the House before Easter.Lord Edmund Talbot said that he had pointed out thatthe Bill must either be taken forthwith or Members must beprepared to give up the Easter holiday.   There was a growingfeeling throughout the House that the holiday should not be sacrificed.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that it mightbe possible to take the Committee stage of the Bill today, onthe understanding that,.the Report stage and Third Readingwere disposed of on Friday.    This would enable the holidayarrangements to be maintained.    If, however, the House of &apos;Commons insisted oh a more prolonged discussion, it should beinformed that, this could only be given by sacrificing the holiday,Lord Edmund Talbot remarked that it would not be pos-sible. to give the whole of Friday to this Bill, as the Househad been promised a discussion on that day on the GivilService War Bonus Estimates.    It woiild also be necessary tomake arrangements with a view to the House ofvLords giving a first Reading to the Bill on Friday, so that 11 might pass through its remaining stages in the House of Lords on MondaysTuesday or Wednesday of next week.The Conference agreed  That Sir Donald Maclean should be invitedto ask the Prime Minister today whether itwas the intention of the Government to pass. the Bill through all its stages forthwith,and that in reply the Prime Minister should indicate the willingness of-the Government-1-
- *(&apos;to give as much time for discussion aspossible, on the understanding that theCommittee stage would be completed today and the Report and Third Reading stageson Friday next.     The Prime Minister might take the opportunity of emphasizing the&apos;great importance, from the point of viewof the national interest, of imposing thissanction on Germany with the least possible delay, and the danger of postponing the   .putting into operation of the provisionsof the Bill.    If the House, of Commons wasnot prepared to support the Government in enforcing the sanction, the Government must .eonsidp-r the question of withdrawing theBill, as they could be no party to a sham.ite from which The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Conferencehi will opezv -;e. that, as drafted, the Bill came into operation as from thedate of its passing into law,the date on which public notice of the intention of the Government topass this legislation was given.    In the Interest of the Bill-itself, as well as in the interest of good administration, itwas desirable to insert a fixed date.   Apart from other considerations, the Board of Trade would have to set upCommittees to work the Act, and these Committees could notbe established in the few days available before the passingof the Act.   Unless, therefore, some concession was made,1 great trouble and confusion would result immediately on theRoyal Assent being given to the Bill.   He therefore suggestedthat the Bill should be amended so as to make it-operate asfrom March 31, 1921,The Conference agreed -To accept the suggestion of the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer.The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Confer-ence that under the Bill, as drafted, it was open to personshaving standing contracts entered into before March 8,, 1921,to take their case before a Board of Trade Committee with aview to getting seme relief.   As a result off enquiries madeby the Board of Trade it was clear that practically all such contracts would In fact be taken before the Committeesunless a time concession could be made     In the result, thefoncessionregardsstandingcontracts.
202&quot;&apos; . fCommittees would be overwhelmed with appld.ca.tion r-and -wouldhave to adopt some rough and ready method of-dealing withthe problem.    He accordingly suggested that in the case ofthese standing contracts entered into before March 8th, aperiod of one month should be granted in order that thegoods might be cleared.    The effect of this would be thatno payments would be made to the Exchequer in respect of such contracts! before, say, May 1, 1921.In support of this proposal it wa3 pointed out thatin the absence of any concession a very heavy penalty wouldbe imposed by the Bill an British nationals, particularly inthose cases, which were very numerous, where - pay men b 3 hadbeen made ih advance.    In any event the pressure on the trading conrfminity would be severe, owing to the loss of future Gei-man orders and the fact that London Would probablycease to finance the trade,,.   The inconvenience to &quot;the Britishtraders would be greatly increased if the Allied Governmentsdid not immediately pass legislation Similar to this Bill.Thie demand for some concession would come not only from theHouse of Commons but from the whole trading community, andit was very desirable, in the interests of a possible future settlement with Germany, that the Government should have the trading community on their side in carrying out this particular-lar method of getting money for reparation.On the other hand, it wa&amp; pointed cttt by the PrimeMinister that this particular measure was needed as a sanctionand that it was most material to impose the sanction on germany with as little delay as possible, so as to exert themaximum pressure on Germany at the critical moment, which,in his view, was the present moment.   He felt some doubt whether, in fact, the immediate enforcement of the sanctionimposed a very heavy penalty on British traders, and evenif it did put certain of those traders to some inconvenienceit must be remembered that the interests affected were engaged in importing cheap Gerfcan goods into this country,
possibly to the-^Hrrijneirrh^^ andBritish labour.   Personally he did not see any ineomreni-once in compelling persona to buy in Great Britain insteadef in Germany.    The cases of traders who had made payments in advance could, no. doubt, be specially treated.   The factthat this was a sanction imposed on Germany was bound to leadto an outcry, and precisely the same elements whioh had sp-- posed the Dyestuffs Bill and the Safeguarding of IndustriesBill would oppose this Hill, and for similar reasons.    He,doubted whether these elements would agree to any compromise,and in any case he was most reluctant to have to adopt apolicy the effect of which would be to postpone the opera-rtion o^ th** sanction for at least six weeks.   He agreed thatif it ,had been possible by agreement with the Germans tointroduce this arrangement as a means of raising money for reparation and not as a sanction, the Government would havebeen justified in making concessions so as to avoid, so faras possible, any inconvenience to British and German traders;- but the fact that the Allies were imposing a sanction madeall the difference,The Conference agreed  That the concession suggested by theChancellor of the Exchequer should netbe made in advance, but that the Chan^-cellor should have discretion to, make this concession in Committee should hefind.it necessary to do- so, on theunderstanding that he wouldiToo t aln s cmscompensating concession in return from   L-the opposition.?ndeavourJOdocation, The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded the Confer-ReceiptPence that he had originally proposed, at the Inter-allied conference,  that each Allied Government adopting this scheme. should retain its own receipts for reparation, and. only paythe surplus into a general pool..   This proposal had, however,been resisted by the French and Belgian d legates, who had insisted on all the money collected being pooled for thebenefit of all Powers interested in reparation.   An amendment&apos;had now been moved, the effect of which would be to restore the original-^Britisli proposal,
:   The Prime Minister remarked that M. Briand hadincorrectly informed the French Chamber that the allies had agreed to pool all the.receipts.   He himself and mr chamberlain had rejected this (1.0,P.-181-A, page 9, andI.CP.-182, page 2), and in point of fact the whole ques-&apos;  tion of the.future of the receipt .3 had been left open.The, Conference agreed --That -an answer to this effect might begiven to the amendment, and in this con-neetion it.might be stated that theBritish Government was in no way commit- \ted to the principle of pooling thereceipts.fSLEG-RAM FROM &apos;     (2) The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew the attentionr CHURCHILL.of the Prime Minister to a telegram which the Colonial-Office had just received from Mr Churchill, and suggestedthat the Secretary to the Cabinet, should take the PrimeMinister&apos;a instructions on the action to be taken on the telegram, particularly with regard to the directions to begiven to the War Office and the Ministry of Shipping on matters concerning those Departments.lUSSIAN TRADE (3) The Prime Minister was informed by Sir Sidney ChapmanIGRKEMEOT,that the Russian Trade-Agreement had been,signed that mornir.&quot;With regard to the question of &quot;Gold&quot;, it had been arranged that a test action should be brought in the Courts, and thatif the Courts decided that the Soviet Government had no titlto the gold the Soviet Government would be at liberty to&quot;treat the Trade Agreement as cancelled.The Conference agreed -That the Board of Trade should furnish the Prime Minister with an answer to aPrivate Notice Question to be askedtoday on the subject of the executionof the Russian Trade Agreement.2, ^hitPhall Gardens, S,W.l,March 16, 1-921.W.e
