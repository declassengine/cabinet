gMAL     (1* ^^xer^^o^uaion 1 cf the Conference of- Ministers held on April 6th. the Prime-Minister notified&amp;v e n ti oPosition^the^Cenference of the results of a meeting which he, accom-panied by Mr Chairberlain, the Chancellor of the Exchequer-     . .    .    . ^,      and the Minister of Labour,      *the President of the Board of Tra^ had held the same morning with the Executive of the Miners&apos; Federation^ as theimmediate result of the invitation decided on at the Confer-ence of Ministers on the previous day.In order to explain the position which had beenreached, the Prime Minister recalled that in the Debate inthe House of Commons on April 5th. Mr Asquith had made his view perfectly clear, that one of the essential conditionsof the resumption of negotiations, which he advocated, wasthat the miners should undertake to resume the services essential for the safety of the mines.    In his own subsequent. speech the Prime Minister hinself had made it no less clearthat this was an essential condition of the exercise of theGovernment&apos;s good offices to bring together the parties tothe dispute.    The invitation sent to the Mining association and the Miners&apos; Federation in consequence of the decision pf   \the Conference of Ministers on the previous day, had specificsly referred to the Prime Minister&apos;s statement in the House,so that there had appeared to be little room for doubt thatone of the essentials to the Government&apos;s mediation was,inter alia, the resumption of pumping and other arrangementsimmediately essential to the safety of the mines.   The mine-owners had made it clear that they would not meet the Miners&apos;Federation so long as the latter were deliberately allowing the mines to be destroyed, and the Prime Minister had accord-! jingly had communications with the Miners&apos; Federation on this   j subject.   It had then transpired that the.Miners&apos; Federationhad not understood that measures to secure the safety of the mines were an essential condition of the resumption of dis-cussions with the owners.   Consequently, the meeting held that morning had been with the Executive of the Miners&apos;- Federation only, and its object had been to clear up this-1-
specific point-as a preliminary^- the- T*Mr&amp;mi3t&amp;-^*t*et&amp;ttB^.,tions, under the Government&apos;s auspices, &quot;between the Miners&apos;Federation and the Mining Association.The Prime Minister had opened the meeting by readingextracts from his own and Mr Asquith&apos;s speeches, which,hehad explained, appeared to make clear his intention that the safety of the wines was one of the conditions;   but he had deliberately suggested that it was unnecessary to discuss thepast, and that the question should be considered on its merits.At the outset the representatives of the miners hadrather taken the line that this was a condition which neverought to have been asked for;   but as the discussion continuedit became perfectly clear that this was not what was in their minds.   After Mr Graham had talked somewhat wildly and hadbeen snubbed by his colleagues, Mr Tom Richards, who is knownras a moderate man, had stated quite bluntly that the withdrawalof the safety men was a lever intended not only to farce adecision in the miners&apos; favour but a speedy decision, and thatthe Government were asking their to hand over one of their principal weapons.   Mr Herbert Smith had then stated that unless the mine-owners would accept as a basis both thenational wage and the common pool, the safety men would notbe ordered back to the mines.    On the Prime Minister&apos;s remark-ing that this was a very serious decision, Mr Hodges had saidthat as a matter of fact it was a decision of the Miners&apos;-Federation.This had made it perfectly dear, therefore, that evenif the meeting between the Mining Association and the Miners&apos;Federation had taken place, it must inevitably have broken downin consequence of this resolution by the miners not to order the safety men to return to the mines unless a surrender wasmade on the two most fundamental points at issue.   The PrimeMinister, after a short adjournment, had consequently made a considered statement in order to focus the issue on the point
IattitudbIhe ra il-sh.(posit ionCOTIAND.OS IT IONP&amp;IES.pon INpd.of the miners&apos; refusal to order back the safety men.     Tothis the Miners f Federation had vouchsafed no reply.The present situation, therefore, was a very graveone, and the present Conference had been summoned to consider what further precautionary measures should be taken.(2) The Conference were informed that reports from many quarters indicated that the attitude of the railwaymen towardsthe miners was lukewarm.     The position taken by Mr. Bromley,the Secretary of the Locomotive Engineers1 and Firemen^Union, had exercised considerable influence.(3) The Conference were informed that the storm-centres in Scotland were Fifeshire, Lanark shire and Ayreshire.    the solicitor-General for Scotland had had a Conference with theGeneral Officer Commanding (General Davies) and Sir William Robertson, the Lord-Lieutenant of Fife, as a result of whichhe had telegraphed that they w ere all clear that the militaryshould not at present be employed for protection in Fifeshire.In this county the situation was reported to be somewhat betterIn Lanarkshire, the situation as regards public order had been somewhat bad, but reinforcements of police had be^nsent In and the posit ion was restored.The siutation in Ayreshire was also unsatisfactory, but mr. James Brown, M.P., a Miners&apos; Agent, had gone there withthe intention not only of doing his utmost to restore orderbut also to secure, if possible, the resumption of pumpingin Vcy&amp; mines *(4)   The Conference were informed that the reports fromWales were somewhat disquieting, and that unrest was increas-ing.     The Chief Constable of Glamorganshire hoped to obtain100 men from West Sussex.     The presence of troops, however,was considered desirable.(5) The.Conference were informed that, apart from the disturbances in South Wales, there was no serious trouble inthe minefields south of the Tweed.
(6) After considering the ^situation as summarised above.the Conferences agreed -That the Secretary of State for W&amp;x*possessed full authority to authorisethe responsible mil&amp;ary authoritiesto make such movements of troops asthe situation might require.(7) With reference to Cabinet 17 (21), Conclusion 3(d), it was suggested that the Lord Chancellor^ Sub-Committee should be strengthened and its Terms of Referenceextended   so as to cover all the defence aspects of thepresent industrial situation, thus forming a companionand parallel Committee to the Supply and Transport-Committee.The Conference agreedThat a Committee composed as follows -The Lord Chancellor (in the Chair).The JPIrst Lord of the Admiralty,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for Air,Dr. addison,The Home Secretary, .*The Secretary for Scotland.The Minister of Transport (when able to attend).Colonel S.H, Wilson (Secretary)Lieut-Colonel Walker (Assistant Secretary),should be appointed to consider all protectionquestions arising out of the present situation,including the raising of special troops and the use oi the Forces of the Crown.     TheCommittee should have full Cabinet authorityto approve action being taken on all secondaryquestions, but should obtain the approval ofthe Cabinet to its recommendations on largequestions of policy, such as the enlistment of special Forces and the calling up of reserves.     It should work in the closest possible touch and co-ordination with theSupply and Transport Committee.(8) The Conference were informed that General lord cavan, the General Officer Commanding at Aldershot, was from today In charge of the London as well as of theAldershot areas, the two having been amalgamated for thepresent emergency.The Conference took note of this arrangement with satisfaction, and the hope was expressed that It would be impressed on General lord cavan that the Cabinet fully relied on his personal exerci3e of this authority.
jjjlOTSriOATiONS      (9T)&quot;&quot;*nie-Corr^^ of greati and TRANS- xrrrporirance that the facts of the present position shouldWORKERS.be before the Executives of the Railwaymen&apos;s Unian and theTransport Yorkers&apos; Federation at the meetings which were bound to take place forthwith.The Minister of labour undertook to concert arrangements for this purpose.!NT- IN (19) The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertookIAMENT. to draft a statement for the use of thePrime Minister and Lord Curzon respective-ly in the House- of Goirmons and House ofLords that afternoon.REPRESF.NTA-     (11) Some discussion took place as to various misrepresented-HS OP GOVERN-.POLICY, sen tat ions o^ Government oolicy, which it was felt requiredearly refutation.   Among these were the fo Hawing:-(i) A widely circulated statement to theeffect that the Government were incollusion with Capital generally ina deliberate and concerted attemptto beat down wages:(ii) An allegation, ;nade more than once inthe recent Debate in the House ofCommons, that whereas the nestingsbetween the representatives of theGoverrimeno and the Miners&apos;  Federa-tion are public, those with theMining Association are secret.In this connection attention was called to a Memoran-dum circulated by Dr Addison, in which he pointed out that in very many districts the only newspapers on sale were copies0-&quot; the &quot;Daily Herald &quot;(Paper CP. -2801).Various suggestions were mad^ for overcoming this      *difficulty, including the distribution of leaflets, even bypo3t, in areas where it was unsafe to distribute them byhand;  .and the employment of Party electoral machinery forthis purpose.There was general agreement that it was very importantby some means or another to furnish material to persons of moderate leanings, who probably constituted the great masseven in the trining districts, in order that they couldcounter the arguments of the extremists;    and the general
2s? 9view waa that the Press waa by far the most Important mediumfor this purpose.The Conference agreed -(8) That Sir Philip Lloyd-Greame, the Chairmanof the Publicity Sub-Committee of the Supplyand Transport Committee, should have authorityto take action, which had already been fully considered, for obtaining the use Qf certainorgans of the Scottish Press, at a cost ...which Sir Philip Lloyd Greame estimatedwould probably not exceed  1,000:   *(b)   That, subject to the approval required by theSupply and Transport Committee, the general statement which had been prepared by sir philip Lloyd-Greame*s Sub-Committee on publicity should be Issued :(c)   That Sir Philip Lloyd-Grearae should givecarefxil consideration to the proposals forthe issue of leaflets, and should, inconsultation with Mr. McCurdy, confer withselected political agents and other suitable persons In order to ascertain the best meansof conveying leaflets intothe mining districts:(d)   That a suitable opportunity should be foundto deny in Parliament the statements as tocollusion between the Government and the mine-owners, and Capitalists generally, to lower wages.BILITY      (12) The Conference were Informed that arrangements   jSRS&apos;   had been made to ensure a continuance of Government publicity in the eveit of a stoppage of newspapers.2, Whitehal   Gardens, S.W.I.,April 7th, 1921.
