AND The Conference met as a Drafting Committee, in 7aroe with a decision of the Conference of Ministers held thelea for same morning, to consider the nature of the statement toement sament. be made in the House of Commons that afternoon in regardto the Coal Dispute and its forthcoming extension into a widespread strike,.The first question was one of principle, as to whetherthe statement should consist only of a bare announcement ofthe facts of the case and of the measures to be adopted^ tomeet the situation, or whether it should include an appeal tothe nation, conceived on the broadest lines.Having regard to the number of documents to be readand to the limitations of time imposed by Parliamentary pro-cedure, which, on a Friday afternoon, involved the Speaker&quot; soleaving the Chair by 5/p.m., the view was accepted that thestatement must be conceived within comparatively narrow limits.It was agreed that the statement should begin withthe reading of the letters exchanged between the Prime Ministerand the two parties to the dispute.    The character of the-  nextminers1 demands should/       be explained.    The duty of theGovernment should then bs stated, namely, to protect property;to preserve order:    and to maintain the food supply and.   essential&apos;services of the country.    The action of the miners in assembling in great crowds in order to intimidate the men engaged in pumping and to prevent the saving of the mines should be set forth.    The measures to be adopted should then be stated in such order as to emphasize the civilianmeasures and to put the military steps in the background;that is to say, they should be set forth in the following order
volunteers for the safety of tho pits, for food andother special services, special constables, the calling out of the reserves, and the creation of a special force.A special point should be made of the inclusionof a passage to combat the widespread statement that thepresent dispute was the beginning  of a general attack on wages in all Industries.(The Conference thon adjourned for the preparationof detailed statements).Whitehall Gardens j S *W.8th.
