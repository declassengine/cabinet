With reference to tho Conference of Ministers heldon April 11th, 1921, Conclusion 1, the lord Privy Sealreraar-od thet when the Conference hed agreed to thoflights to tho gorodroraos in Trans jordania, so that moral support might be afforded to Abfiulla,he had not realised that any further etcps for the development of the desertroute to Mesopotamia wore in progress:    now that news had been received from Sir P. Cos that a flight was about to start Westwards from Hit to reconnoitre tho Eastern endagainof this route, he considered that the question should fiereviewed. The original cabinet  decision had deprecatedany action which might complicate matters in Transjordaniaand had aimed at securing peace in tKSfHatiSet by theinfluonce of air forces based dn Palestine:    the Conferenceon April 11th had acted within the limits of this cabinet decision when sanctioning the flight between Ludd andAmman;The Secretary of State for the Colonies stated thathe had not originally proposed to bring this matter beforethe Cabinet as ho considered that it was really one whichcould have been sanctioned departmental!;^     The Gape to cairo flight, the flight to India and Australia had notboon brought before tho Cabinet, while the use of aircraft in tho Somali     operation din 1919 had bean settled by himself and Lord Milnor.Air Vice Marshal Salmon! had first flown across thodesert in the winter of 1918/1919 and it had been.proposedto sand all aircraft from Egypt to Mesopotamia and vice versa by this route:    then owing to trouble between theFrench and the Arabs,  the general feeling amongst^tho-; -       -&apos; &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;        . h&apos;tribes deteriorated and all pianos wore sent round by sha,an expensive and longthyprocess.     It was hoped that ahotter
better feeling was now being engendered amongst the Arabs, and at the recent meeting in Cairo all the political, military and air experts recommended the opening of the desert route at once with a view to strengthening the friendly tribal fooling towards us.

It was proposed to develop the route gradually by ? forward from each and by stages of 50 miles or so, and to form at those stages small stores of petrol, etc. until the whole gap across the desert had been bridged. These small stores would have no personnel but be simply places where planes could come down and refill if necessary. The Arabs could look after ? small depots and would get a certain amount of pay for such work and so come to look upon tho air force as a valuable friend. Before a Commercial Air Service to the East could be established it was essential that the desert route should be developed as a first stop and then at a later date the Royal Air Force and the commercial planes would be of mutual assistance.

At present on the west end of the route no advance had been made beyond Amnan, but at the Eastern end about 3   stages had been prospected: there was also a railway survey party reconnoitring for a rail and pipe-line route across the desert and it had been suggested to them that they might find the present chance a suitable opportunity for pushing on with their work.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs considered that the precedents quotod were hardly analogous as they were probably undertaken as war measures: the opening of tho desert route now might raise ? political questions not only with the tribes but internationally since so much interest was now taken in mandated territories. The development of the route would undoubtedly be desirable when it was safe to do so: in 1919 railway reconnaissance


reoonnadjBsanc^a^zbrom-bo^ owing tohostility on the part of the tribes and it was vory questionable whether their feelings had now changed so much as to welcome ourpresence on this route: ho was also doubtful whether the RailwaySurvey could be satisfactorilycombinod with tho development ofthe air route.The ^ord Irivy Seal agreed that tho tribes might net yet bosufficiently friendly for the development of this route and considered we might become entangled in complications which, atthe present time, we could not afford to risk.A discussion then aroso in which it was pointed out that if negotiations had to be opened with the local tribes to guard thedumps it would not only take a long time but also be difficultto keep the triboa to their bargains: it was, however,  remarked that in some cases tho dump3 would be in absolute desert where-there were no tribes and that they would always be very small and require no personnelvto look after them.   No orders had boengiven to tho Railway Survey to work in conjunction with tho AirForce but it had been pointed out to them that the present mightbe a suitable opportunity for them to advance their reconnaissance.(At this poiat ,.11* Marshal Trenchard-aad ilajor Youngentered).Air Marshal Trenchard stated that from the information given to him by political officers in Oairo, he was of opinionthat there was no danger of tho tribes molesting anyone,the only danger w&amp;b from breakdown or planes gottingV.lost and although the Air Ministry would ,take every precautionagainst this, it must be ospected in pioneer work.It was proposed to develop the route step by step so thatthe tribes would get to know in advance of the coming of       xthe aeroplanes: in toe first instance long distance planesV/should bo used, flying 300 miles, and ^it would not be necessaryfor them to land between Azrak and Ramadi except in thecase of a technical defect: it was-only in this, case thatdumps would be required, and the- disabled piano by its/
its wireless could summon assistance if the dump were not available. It was not proposed to use short distance planes until the long distance ones had thoroughly established the route.

Major Young pointed out that the Eastern portion of the route had no water at all and was quite uninhabited except for occasional moving bands: any trouble which might be expected from the tribes would be from the Palestine end..

The Secretary of State for India remarked that Abdulla was now in Trans-Jordania and would presumably be of help in smoothing the way with the tribs at the Western end: he was of opinion that the scheme should be proceeded with.

Some further discussion then took place in which it was pointed out that all the political officers concerned, including the High Commissioners of Palestine and Mesopotamia, recommended tho inauguration of the scheme now and that they were of opinion that no danger was to be expected; it was also pointed out that whatever risk might be incurred, would be in the section West of ?, an area to which the extension of our air influence had already been sanctioned.

While the sense of the meeting was strongly in favour of not adopting any policy which might tend to increase British commitments the conference agreed that :-

As all export opinion considered that there was no risk, the development of the desert air route to Mesopotamia should be proceeded with on the lines proposed by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.
