^LQ^nON- 7)16 Secretary&quot; of- State&quot; for Foreign Affairs stated- , th^t the Italian Ambassador- Signer de Martino, had seen him1st Dele-\i during the morning and bad informed him that Count Sforza -was arriving on Sunday, and that the Kemalist delegation from Angora was at present in Rome.    Count Sforza would liketo have an invitation from the British Government which hecould communicate to the Kemalist a,- and so be able to inform them that this invitation had been obtained by his personalintervention.    The Ambassador asked that we might send someinvitation to this effect.   He (Lord Curzon)&apos; had pointedout that an invitation had already been sent to the Kemalistsvia Constantinople, and that the deputation&apos;had been ap-pointed and had already started.    To this invitation theFrench and Italians had assented.    To issue a fresh invita-tion would place the Turkish Government In a very difficult position.    He was inclined to agree with Count Sforza thatthere is a close Understanding between Constantinople and the kemalists,  and suggested sending a telegram to Count Sforzathrough the Italian Ambassador, saying&apos; tha-1 there is no need to send an invitation, since the delegation had already started.The Secretary of State for India said he consideredthe situation satisfactory if the Delegation came;    but, onthe other hand,  the Delegation might not actually come.-   Ifthe Delegation did not come, the reason for the Conferencedisappeared, which would mean that there could be no peace in the East;-&apos;   It would be preferable if the Koraalist and constantinople Delegations came together, but if they wouldnot do this they should be allowed to come separately,rather&quot; than that either should be absent.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that thecause of peace ought not to be jeopardised on a point ofetiquette.    He had no objection to the Italians bringing the Angora Delegates.    This Delegation were the&apos;-people whorepresented the old - Turkish&apos;Government.   At present theBritish policy appeared to be one of&apos; making inroads on the
Turkish.&apos;Pxjas^-sdjC)ns.,---a^r^ -aggreaaions&quot; on the whole Islamic .movement.- . Before Peace with Turkey had been signed he had.wished to attack the Turks in-, every possible way, but now-he desired to -listen te what their Delegates had to say.If, when they arrived, it was found that they claimed impos-sible things,, then he was suite ready for any counterbfter some further discussion., the Conference agreedThat the Secretary of State for PsreignAffairs should send the following telegram to Count Sforza, -through the Italian Ambas-eador:- ...&quot;Invitation to Angora Delegation has:already been given, and they are well on.their way.   His. Majesty&apos;s Government agreewith Count Sforza in thinking that it isImpossible to. extend a more formal invita-tion at this. date.ho *. (2) The Conference agreed -. That there should, be -a meeting of repre-sentatives :of - the Allied Powers at 10,.Downing Street, on Monday,. February 21,,1921, at 11-30 a.-m., to arrange the pro-cedu.ro to be followed during the Confer-&quot;ence with the representatives of Greece. and Turkey..(3) The Prime Minister invited the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to review the main questions likely&apos;to arisedur ing the C o nference.The Secretary of.Stats for Foreign Affairs stated thatat the Paris Conference it-had been recognised that not onlyhad the Treaty of .Sevres not-been&apos;ratified, but that certain points &quot;of it had. already fallen into desuetude by the-passageof events, and in other respects was open to revision..He- was of opinion, and he believed the French were inclined to agree,, that the Treaty of.Sevres should not be sacrificed.,for this would reopen the..whole question of the Middle xrast,Mardatgs for- Mesopotamia,. Syria and Palestine, the. Bulgarianquestion, Thrace, and the Straits.    It appeared to himadvisable, to proceed.on the basis of the Sevres Treaty,but to be willing-, to- modify, certain- features of it.
An understanding should first of all be come to on those parts of the Sevres Treaty which should remain unchanged,and he suggested that alterations should n*t be allowed inrespect of the followingC1) Constantinople:    i.e,,that the Sultan shouldhave his Government and Capital there:(ii) The Straits: i.e.,that the Straits should bein the hands of an International Commission,safeguarding the passage fr*m the Mediter-ranean to the Black Sea:(iii) The Turkish Empire in Europe: i.e., the clauses dealing with Thrace and the de-militarised zone.The Kemalists would undopbt-dly ask for (ill) to be revised and advance demands for Adrianople, Chatalja and othercities to be returned to the Turks,    He considered thatthese should be resisted, for the fallowing reasons:-   Ifthe frontier were re-adjusted to the Enos*-Media line, terri-tory would be handed over to Turkey in which the population is more Greek than Turk, and in northern Thrace Greece: wouldbe unable to maintain herself.    Bulgaria would enter thefield and want compensation, and the Turk would be brought back in command of both banks of the Straits and the Sea of marmora.    Proceeding, Lord Curzon stated that other points which he considered should not be touched wers:-(iv) Classes relating to Mesopotamia, palestine and Syria:(v) Clauses relating.to the Hejaa:(vl) Clauses relating to our status in Cyprus,Egypt:, etc:(vii) Clauses relating to Italian status in the Aegean, Libya, etc:(viii) Clauses relating to the status of Prancein Morocco, Tunis,etc.There remained, however, some other points of the treaty which       considered were open to discussion and might be revised..  He considered these points to be:-(ix) Kurdistan;(x) Armenia:(xi) Smyrna.  .
k-XxiiV He-did not propose to/touoh Cillcia,. because that was a Frenchquestion.    Prance had -proposed&apos; to occupy it, hut now sheproposes to evacuate it owing to the exDense and difficultyholding it,.The Secretary of State for the Colonies enquiredabout the Italian area.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs repliedthat this was not mentioned in the Treaty.    This was dealt-with in the Tripartite Agreement, and the Tripartite Agree-ment was not in the Treaty, although the Italians wished itto be.jtan..   (xiii)       As regards Kurdistan, we had originally contemplated the Kurds being autonomous under some sort of British super-vision; but now, owing to our present position in Mesopotamia,t-his would be most difficult to arrange.    If an agreement could be come to with the Kemalists it might be possible toarrange for some, sort of autonomous State of Kurdistan under.,Turkish supervision.a..(xiv) We recognised Armenia by. the Treaty to be an Independ-ent State, with a Capital at Brivan.    The boundaries of thisIndependent State were not settled, and had been referred to president Wilson.    President Wilson had proposed to includelarge portions of Turkish territory, including Trebizond,in- the State of Armenia, but; that was now quite impossible,owing to the course, of events,-.   The Turks and the Bolshevikshad. descended on to the borders of Armenia simultaneously.First, the ^urks, with the cognizance, of the Bolsheviks, had come and taken Kara&apos; and other pla ces in that neighbourhood,&apos; and. then the&apos;Bolsheviks, seeing that the Turks were already    .appropriating the country,, started to act for themselves;&apos;   they commenced by flooding the country with Bolshevistpropaganda, followed up by Soviet emissaries,..until eventual- .ally a Soviet Government had been formed at Erivan.    Mean-while., the anti-Bolsheviksvof Armenia were organising aresistance...   He thought that with-the help of the Kemalists
we might he able to get a definite -boundary agreed upon between Armenia and Turkey, but we could not arrange aboundary between Armenia and the Bolsheviks;    that theymust settle amongst themselves.    In this way the Armeniansmight secure an autonomous existence.    In the event of Ciliciabeing handed back to the Turks it might be advisable for usto try and arrange for the Armenian residents there tomigrate and loin ; the Armenians in Armenia Proper, -Next, as to. Smyrna, by the Treaty of Sevres a naminalsuzerainty of the Turks had to be maintained there, but otherwise the administration was to be Greek in every respect. The local Parliament, after five years, was to havethe opportunity of incorporating the country;aa part of greece if. it go desired.    Lord Cursor was convinced.that&apos;whatever the Kemalists might say&apos; about Adrianople,-- theywould take a very firm line on the question of.-Smyrna.    Theposition was that the Greeks, were a majority of the populatiaand they also had military forces there;    and as long as theycontinued the Venizelist policy they- would be very loath towithdraw.    Our attitude would largely depend on whether theConference encouraged the Greeks to&apos;carry on hostilities in Asia Minor.    It was essential to rake some satisfactory arrangement about Smyrna, - Greece would have to be givensomething solid, and the Turks would have to be propitieted.Inasmuch as the whole history of ^turkey showed a slippingaway;-to&apos; other nations of the outlying provinces,, he thought the safest method would be to act on the:&quot;analogy of - one ofthe provinces which had become detached from the turkish empire.    He considered:that the example of Eastern Roumelia,as created&quot; -by the Treaty of Berlin in 1878, was possibly thebest precedent.    Most people probably realised that Smyrnawould eventually slip away ;from Turkey in exactly the same way -as Roumelia, but what was required was an interim arrangement to meet the present situation.    The constitutionof Eastern-Roumelia might be adapted to. the proposed
arrangements for Smyrna.    He would suggest(a) That Turkish suzerainty should, he recognisedover Smyrna:(b) That a Christian Governor should he appointedby th* Powers for five years, who might be either a Greek or of other nationality;    pos-sibly at first it would be better for him notto be a. Greek: .(c) That the military defences of the area shouldbe organised by means of.a Gendarmerie ar-ranged by the Powers:-(d) That an -Administration dealing with Customs^Law Courts, etc..,. should be devised.   Underthe mreaty of Sevres the whole of this Admin-i st. ration was to be handed over to the Greeks:(e) That a Provisional Assembly- should be appointed.He would nof. go into any further details,, but he was quite sure that during&apos; the first few days of the. Conference claims and counter-claims of all sorts would be put forward by thevarious parties at- the Conference, and when they had all ax-exhausted therselves in their demands he was of opinion that we might come forward with some?thing on the above lines,, whichmight prove acceptable.In reply to a question, Lord Curson stated that,underthe arrangement which he had outlined, Greece would have allthat she had won in Europe, and would exercise the dominationr f &apos; v .      fe- y&apos;.--?-in Smyrna to which h -r trade and her population entitled her.Lord Curaon went on to say that, he -would suggest that thedistrict should be called &quot;The Smyrna Province&quot;, as thet%would humour the Turks, who translated &quot;Province&quot; by.   &quot;Vilayet&quot;.partite (xvi) Other points of importance were:-lament.(i) The maintenance of the bargain by which theItalians would have to hand back the Islands(with the-exception of Rhodes) to Greece:(ii) The observance of the Tripartite Agreement -was a matter to which Italy attached - greatimportance, as she hoped to obtain therebya considerable amount of mineral and other,advantages.[itary    (xvii)   &apos;      As regards the military provisions of the Treaty, helvi si one . &apos;had. at *irst understood that the War Office&apos;were disturbed at the prospect of keeping troops in th-- demilitarised area,   .
II .....      Illbut h^rKX^-Tinderatood.-that they did not wish to make anychants in the military provisions, though they held strongviews on the political clauses.jMxviii) In reply to a question why the substitution of theBnos-Media line for Chatalja damaged British interests, LordHurzon stated that British interests were not directly affect-sd except through the fact that this would mean that therewould be no chance of a real peace.    The Greeks would haveto be turned out, and th   Bulgarians would immediately come in.The Secretary of State for India asked whether it wasadvisable for the Government definitely to decide beforehandwhat they would alter in the Treaty of Sevres and what theywould not;    would it not be better to wait and see thevarious claims put forward by the Delegations at the Confer-ence, and then decide what course of action to adopt?ijan. (xix) The Prime Minister was inclined to agree.    lie went onto say that he was of opinion that Mustapha Kemal was reallylooking towards the- Past rather than to the -Y/est.    He thoughtthat- Mustapha Kemal was basing his strength in Azerbaijanand would like to know if he could be encouraged in that direction.    Azerbaijan could not possibly remain independent,and would have to be either Turkish or Bolshevist.Lord Curzon, continuing, said that It must be remember-ed that a large portion of the population of Azerbaijan wasTurkish and Mohammedan, and their presence would create lessharm to us than that of the Bolsheviks.    Then also there wasiia.(*xx)    the existence of Georgia, which State the Government had onlythe other day recognised de jure, a course to which he himself had been opposed.   The existence cf Georgia was one of themain difficulties in the problem of the Caucasus.   He did- not say this because he felt any animosity against theGeorgians;    on the contrary, one must admire the way inwhich they had resisted the blandishments of the.Soviet Gov-government%nt.    It was, however, of the utmost importance to preventthe Turks from getting back to saturn.1&apos;&quot; 7 &apos;&quot;
The Secretary of State for the Colonies- said he wouldbe prepared to hand Azerbaijan to the Turks.The Secretary of&quot; State for India suggested that theForeign Office should consider two points:-(a) Whether a Constitution, on lines somewhat similar to that of Roumelia, could not beapplied to Thrace:(xxl) (k) Whether it would not assist In a&apos; settlementof the Near Eastern question to invite theArabs to be represented at the Conference inthe following week.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs hoped thatthe occasion of the forthcoming Conference would be used tobring aibout an agreement between the French and the Arabsy :but he doubted if the best way to do this was by the latter being invited to take part in tho general negotiations,. They,had no locus stand! in the matter, King Hussein having de-dined to sign the Treaty of Sevres,     He thought the best waywas for the British representatives at the Conference to dealdirect with M* Berthelot.A suggestion was made that, as we might be prepared tomake concessions to the French regarding Mustapha Kemal, the &apos;French, as a quid pro quo^ should make concessions which would facilitate agreement with the Arabs at Baghdad and Damascusand in Transjofdania.The Secretary of State for India said that he feltcertain that either the Angora or the Constantinople Turks would raise the question of the guardianship of the HolyPlaoes, and if King Hussein was confronted with the poss- .Ibillty of his subsidy being cut off he would be more inclined to come to some arrangement with the Sultan on this question.The Secretary of State for the Colonies expressedregret at the suggestion that we should cast aside the Arabconception of guarding the Holy Places, and pointed out that whilst there was much to be said in favour of Mustapha Kemalkeeping the Turkish flag flying in places in which he was interested, yet he had little to do with the tombs of Meccaand Modina,
The Secretary of State, for india explained that he.did not.mean to suggest that the Ttirk should ever go hack toArabia;;- only, that some arrangement might be come to by whichhis spiritual, authority over the Holy Places was maintained...   The Lord President of the, Council said he had not been &apos;in a position to follow closely the financial and military considerations ;of. this question,, but in his opinion they hadp^ir-vex^ted the policy of the.Allies. In regard to TurkeysPutting aside.^ however, this aspect of the .question, hothought the position a deplorable one.    Of all the nations who entered the War, the Bulgarians&apos; and the Turks had the worst record;, and Turkey, which owed its continued existence-to-France and England, had behaved in an abominable manner and caused untold misfortunes,,   He considered that the Turk3had proved themselves quite hopeless,    They had had moreopportunities and had shown themselves more incompetent than any race in the world.   Whilst the Arabs had contributed theirquota, to the intellectual attainments of the world, and hadpz*produced the Mohammedan religion, the Turks could make nosuch Claim;&apos;   nor had they shown any administrative ability.There was plenty of evidence to show that the Turk was notcapable of ruling.    He had no.great opinion a.f the BorderStates who had cast off the Turkish, yoke, but it was signi-significant that once they were freed from the blighting influence of the Turks they had become increasingly civilised.Mr Balfour, continuing, said that if there had been no Warand the evolution of the Middle last had continued, there was much to be said for the Foreign Secretaryrs proposals regard-ing Smyrna;   but in present circumstances he thought.thearrangement worse than that set out in the Treaty of Sevres.It was bound to offend the Greeks, and,after, all,., they wereour Allies&apos; during the War.   When M. Venizelos was . recently&quot;in England-he (Mr Balfour) had asked him about the defensivepowers of Smyrna, and ,M. Venizelos had said that Smyrna&apos; could hold Its. own. and that Mustapha Kemal as a fighting force, had
been greatly; exaggerated&apos;.   M. Vendiaelos- had aeaerted thatSmyrna--vxlurrte-ers would be prepared to defend the Smyrnadistrict.    It had been stated that unless peace was made with mustapha Kemal there would be no peace in the East;    If thispeace was arranged, Kemal would say that he was the onlyperson who had been able to stand against the Great Powers,and it would add immensely to his prestige.    He (Mr Balfour)did not believe that the policy suggested would bring peace,and he viewed the revision of the Treaty with the utmostreluctance.    He would strive to confine the Turks withinstrictly Turkish limits.    Our Allies who wished the Treatyrevised were hoping for some selfish advantage thereby.Doubt was expressed as to whether Greece would be ableto bear the financial burdens involved in meeting a potential emailst threat that might continue for an indefinite, period..The Prime Minister reminded the Conference cf theundertaking given by M. Venicelos at Lympne^ that he could,if given permission by the Allies,  inflict a defeat onMustapha Kemal within a fortnight;    and he had carried, outhi3 promise within ten days.    Why- should it be assumed thatthe Greeks could not defend Smyrna, and that I-fustapha Kernel,-with no support at all,  could keep an army in being ir.de fi-nitely?    Smyrna was a rich port and could, he was informed,raise a rumorous ,body of volunteers.    It was stated thatMustapha Kemal was being financed by the Bolsheviks, but he doubted this, and in any case they did not possess unlimitedresour6es;    He did not think the British Delegates should go into this Conference with the feeling, that mustapha Eamal wssa force before which we must bow down.    To surrender toMustapha Kemal would hot bring peace, but fresh trouble inthe Past.The Secretary of State for -India asked if sufficientconsideration had been given to Mustapha Ke-mai, not as amilitary danger but as a figure representing all those
^interests- who were, united against the Treaty -of Sevres?-With, reference to th&amp; ismarfcs regarding the Turkish proper-tion of the population, -of-oertain,places^ he would like It tobe recorded that he did not accept the figures which were basedon Greek returns *     Further- he would like to add that heattacked more Importance to, the future of Adriancpie than to Smyrna: ,The Secretary cf State for the- Colonies regretted the turn the discussion had taken,     We could either make peacewith the Turks or we could fight the Turks ^     He could only bringhimself to support Lord Curzon:s policy with difficulty, but he did hot, believe that any solution of the problem would be found on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister or Mr, Balfour;&quot;-the., result of which would be indefinite disorder over all the regions under review.     If the outcome of the forthcoming Conforonewere a continuance of the present state of- degeneration and theabsence of an effective peace.with the Turks, his task of pacifyingthe Middle East would be rendered Impossible.     He could onlyregard such a proposal with dismay0- The,Secretary of State for India stated that he had.accepted the Treaty of Sevres, but he was bound to press for itsrevision.&apos; because it was -demonstrable that it had not broughtpeace, and because he was being constantly appealed tc by thosehe represented; tc press fcr a revision.     He agreed withMr., Churchill.The Prime Minister stated that they were all agreed thatthe main object to work for was&apos; a permanent peace.. but he couldnot accept the sharp alternatives, put by Mr. Churchill^ of surrender or war as the only possible alternatives.(4)      The Conference had a brief discussion on the questionOf the Angle-Japanese Alliance in relation to the Dominions-.&apos;2, Tfaltehall Gardens, So1\\.February 18th/ IS2I.
