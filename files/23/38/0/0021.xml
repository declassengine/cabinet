It was also to include the Lord Chancellorof Ireland, the Lord Mayor of Dublin and the Lord Mayorof Cork as ex official.Senators.It was stated that the Senate as&apos;proposed for theSouth.would give some protection to a Protestantminority, but such protection would be greatly strength-.thened if the 17 Senators to be nominated by the. lord lieutenant were nominated by him on the advice of theBritish Ministers. ; As the Bill stood, the Lorr*Lieutenant would nominate - Senators on the - ad-rice of- hi s Irish ,MIni s t er s.After: some discussion the Conference agreedTo accept the Lords&apos; Amendments regardingthe Senates for Northern and. southern ireland, but that the Senate for. NorthernIreland should be   elected by proportional representation.(b) .    The Lords&apos; amendment - with regard to theconstitution of the Council of Ireland provided that.each Parliament shoul-:miratop 20 members the
Commons Hbuse nominating IS Members and the SenateHouse!   7* the election for nomination .to take placeby proportional representation.Objection was taken to the Senate House havinganything to do with the&apos;election of the Council of ireland as the latter administered House of Commons functions.Further, it was stated that the&apos;whole basis of the eon-stitution bf the Council of Ireland was that it should consist of an equal number of representatives from theHorthern and Southern Parliaments, and that the Lords1amendment might mean    that the Council would have a catholicmajority, thus breaking down the ,principle on which, theCouncil was based.After some further discussion the Conference agreed -That the amendments of the House of Lordsaffect ing the C ovuic II of Ire land a should be resisted, and that the Clause.should be., restored In the Bill as it originallyleft   the House of Commons.I&amp;S9S oflals Act.(c)It was  stated that the&apos;Lords had added to thepowers of the Council the&apos;administration of the Diseasesef Animals Act.     Attention was drawn to the fact thatthere were two Boards of Agriculture under the Bill, and thatthe Intervention.of a third body administering a functionrelating to agriculture would lead to much overlapping.The Conference agreed -To reject the amendment of the Lords whereby the Diseases of Animals Act was added to thefunctions of the Council of Ireland but that,should the Lords feel strongly about Its in--&apos; elusion, a concession should be made,.The Cehferenee - then considered the amendment whichfond ChamberUnited     (d)-lament,had been inserted preventing the two Parliaments in theconstitution of &quot;a United Parliament from setting tip a singleChamber Parliament..

Further-, they had provided that theAppointed Day could only be fixed by Resolution of bothHouses when satisfied that His Majesty&apos;s authority and theprotection of life and property were assured.     A further amendment provided that, before these Resolutions could be passed,  the Speaker of the British House must send outnotices to the existing members elected to the british parliament for Irish constituencies, inviting them to say whether they   accept the bill or not  and, if amajorityin either part of. Ireland accept the Bill,  then t.;:-eResolution may be proposed.It was generally considered that the amendments pro-posed by the Lords virere quite unworkable, and. that when thetime-came it was highly probable that Southern Ireland wouldelect a Parliament.The Conference agreed  To resist the Lords&apos; amendments    to the,Suspensory Clause, and to proceed withClause 71 of the Bill in the form inwhich it left the House of Corimons.With regard to the amendment relating to theAppointed Day,  the Conference agreed   .To resist the lords  amendment and to restore the Clause as it left the House-ofCommons.- -4-
