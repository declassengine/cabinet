Settlement With reference to the Conference of Ministers-service in ^ScotlancU    held on Thursday, 30th December,, 1920, at 5*45 p.m.the Secretary for Scotland stated that he had, inconsultation with the Board of Agrlciilture, gonevery thoroughly into the problem set by the PrimeMinister, and. had certain proposals to make.     Hesuggested that the principle should be adopted of accelerating settlement in the Crofting Districts andslotting it down in the Lowlands^     This should be done without any definite declaration of&apos;the policy, andLowland settlement should proceed to a limited extent.In his opinion there were good grounds for justifyingthis policy.    -First, settlement was more urgent inthe Crofting Districts - being an economic necessity.Second, the danger of raiding, and agrarian disturbancewas infinitely&apos; greater there, and third, settlementsand enlargements could be more cheaply provided there.In the matter of costs, the Board had gone very-carefully into the problem and thay estimated that onthe footing that the land ?ms obtained on annual payment Instead, of by capital payment, that the costof equipment was reduced to a minimum, and that theutmost assistance -Was exacted from the. settler, theycould form in Crofting Districts new settlements andenlargements for an average sum &apos;of- 500 each.On a similar footing-, the Board had revised&quot;their estimates for Lowland holdings and believed theycould provide the bare minimum equipment etc., at anaverage cost of  1,500 per holder.These figures would Include loans for buildings,provision of fences, roads and water, where necessary,loss on taking over sheep stock, and compensation to tenants, but would not include provision for stock loans.      .
In regard to numbers and, speed of settlement; theBoard believer! they could make provision in about eighteen months for the settlement (including enlargements) of 2,000settlers In Crofting Districts, and 300 settlers in theLowlands,, for- a sum of  1,481.000,  exclusive of purchase price and loans for stock...    This - sum would.be available if.the Board received  1,033,000 as recommended by theCabinet Committee, and could, as they anticipated, savea further.sum of  393,000 by following as closely as possiblthe Committee&apos;s recommendations to reduce the scale of equipment on holdings, and by making no provision atpresent for expenditure.on farms which are owned by theBoard but which fall out of lease in or after 1923.If these proposals were- agreed to it should bepossible to make provision for. the settlement In the nexteighteen months of 2,000 out cf the 5,000 ex-serviceapplicants, in the Crofting Districts, and 300 out of the1,400 ex-service applicants In the Lowland Districts.In reply to the suggestion by the Chancellor of theExchequer that the Board should accept the principle laiddown by the Cabinet Committee that loans for stock should only be given on the   for   basis, the Secretary forScotland., stated he must adhere to.his reservation on that point as in his opinion it was of vital. Importance thatthe Board should have discretion to make loans up to thefull amount in the case of sheep stocks.Hie Conference agreed
Tq&apos; accept the Secretary for&apos; Scotland?s. proposals as indicated above, on the    understanding(1) that the additional, funds to be providedby the Exchequer shall hot. exceed thesum of  1.-083,000 Mentioned in paragraph37 (3) of&apos;the Report) and(11) thai sub ject: to (2) the recommendations contained in the Report of the LandSettlement Committee regarding economiesare put into operation.(2)    That v/ith regard to loans for purchase of stock(Paragraph 31 (1) of Report).the Board ofAgriculture for- Scotland should have discretion to advance in cases where they.thought it essential to do. so, a higher proportion of the stock value than 50 per cent..2&apos;y Whitehall Gardens:.
