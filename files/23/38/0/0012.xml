Burgle. Assistant Seeret&amp;rj.y o c o c 41 c oWith reference to. Minute Z of the Conclusions of aMeeting of the Cabinet held on August 4tb. 1920 at 11.SO a.m.the Conference considered an application cf the marconi company to the Post Master General dated 22nd Dec ember,1919, with respect to the issue of licences for wireless stations to communicate with foreign countries.It was stated, in favour of granting the application of&apos;the Marconi Company, that under the existing conditions it was unlikely&apos; that the State could afford to make anybig grant,, to the &quot;General Post Office to assist in thedevelopment of a government wireless service, and that.in the circumstances, a more efficient service was likely to result if licences were granted tc thaMarconi Company and other private companies.     experience had shewn that a new service such as wireless telegraphy .
had a greater chance of development under private enterprise than if undertaken by the State. This applied especially at the present moment when the Chancellor of the Exchequer was not likely to be able to assist the Post Office to any great extent if they undertook the work.

 On the other hand it was pointed out that the Government already possessed two Wireless Stations and were in contract for another, so that they were in a favourable position for commencing a wireless service with European countries. With regard to grants from the Exchequer, it was stated that the Post Office could carry on without any very big additional expenditure for some little time to come.

 Attention was drawn to the fact that arrangements had been made with certain foreign governments not to give any concessions to private wireless companies without prior consultation with the Government concerned and it was agreed that this question should be considered before any licences were granted to private companies.

 The Conference agreed, subject to the Post Master General also expressing his approval.

(a) that subject to a definite and satisfactory arrangement being arrived at with the Marconi Co. regarding all the Company&apos;s outstanding claims against His Majesty&apos;s Government, and to a satisfactory understanding as to the future use of Marconi patents, the Company should be granted licenses to erect the necessary stations in the United Kingdom to conduct wireless traffic with foreign countries: but that in no circumstances were they to be given a monopoly.

(b) that, subject to the Post Master General concurring in the conclusion in (a) above, endeavours should be made to negotiate an agreement with the Marconi Company.

(c) that the Secretary to the General Post Office should inform Lord Milner as soon as possible what arrangements (if any) had been made with the governments of foreign countries as regards not granting concessions to private companies without prior consultation with the government concerned.
