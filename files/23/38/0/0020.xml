BUILDING RING FENCE SCHEMES.

1. Sir L. Worthington Evans as Chairman of the Unemployment Committee stated to the Conference that he had been asked by that Committee to refer back for further consideration the decision of the Cabinet (Cabinet 66 (20) Conclusion 4) that no offer of a Government contribution in aid of unemployment insurance should be made to the Building Trade Unions, but that ring fence schemes should be immediately proceeded with, ex-service men put to work upon them and trainers obtained on such terms as would induce them to join.

 At a meeting of the Unemployment Committee following on the above decision the Minister of Health had called attention to the fact that the ring fence schemes would have to be put into operation by Local Authorities and that none of the Local Authorities would agree to putting ex-service men on housing work without the consent of the Trade Unions. Representatives both of the L.C.G. and the Corporation of the City of London had been subsequently interviewed in order to see whether anything could be done. No definite reply had been given by the L.C.C. but it was probable that the scheme could only be passed through the Council with difficulty. On the other hand the Chairman of the Finance Committee of the City Corporation had stated that his Committee would agree to starting a ring fence scheme at Ilford for 2,000 houses, and that there would be no difficulty with the contractor.

 It was pointed out on the other hand that if the contractor realised that he was the only one to undertake work on this basis he might not be ready to do it.

 Sir L. Worthington-Evans also reported that certain proposals had been made by Mr. Easton, the Chairman of the Federation of Building Employers which he had made after consultation with some 20 of the leading builders of the country.


Mr. Easton had pointed out that the employers wanted a scheme of bonus on output, while on the other hand the Government wanted the admission of ex-service men into the building trade. The Government would be unable to fight the Unions without the assistance of the employers since there was enough work other than housing to absorb the whole trade. On the other hand the employers would be unable to make a stand without the assistance of the Government, who, with their housing programme, were the largest employers of building labour.

 It was accordingly proposed that the Government should join hands with the building employers on an offer to the men of -

(1) A Scheme of bonus on output over and above the standard rate of wages;

(2) the admission of ex-service men on building work all over the country in a proportion to the agreed;

(3) a special scheme under the Unemployment Insurance Act involving additional contributions of 6d, per man from the employers and 6d, from each workman which would produce an additional 15/- a week unemployment benefit making 30/- in all.

It was proposed that the Government and the employers should make a stand on this offer and face a strike if such were inevitable.

It was pointed out to the Conference that to insist upon a scheme of bonus an output would add to the difficulty of the Government by evoking strong opposition from the Trade Unions, that negotiations for bonus on output in the engineering trades were now in progress, and if a definite issue were raised on this in the building trade a Trade Union Congress would be summoned at once and a Resolution passed putting a step to any negotiations for bonus on output in any trade whatever. On the other hand it was suggested that as the minors had accepted payment by results and the engineers were discussing it, there was no reason why the building trade should not also discuss it, particularly as the Trade Unions were no longer in so strong

 
a position as they had been.

 At this stage attention was drawn to a letter from a representative builder (C.P.2294) to the effect that if the Government&apos;s scheme were to include a bonus on output a large number of the building employers would not stand firm and that it would be better to make a stand on the question of dilution. On the other hand it was urged that the employers did not want dilution since it involves the use of inexperienced labour and they would refuse to pay an extra insurance contribution unless they were compensated by some form of payment by results.

 It was pointed out that the House of Commons were becoming very impatient at the delay and that a definite answer must be given to a question to be asked the same day by Sir William Davison.

 "To ask the Minister of Labour, whether the negotiations with the building Trades Unions which have been in progress for the past 15 months to allow dilution so that at least 50,000 unemployed ex-service men may be employed in the building of urgently needed houses for the working classes have now been completed; whether there are at least 65,000 fewer skilled men in the building industry than there were in 1914; and whether he will assure the House that, in the event of an agreement not being arrived at between the Government and the Trades Unions before the House rises, the Government will themselves take such steps as may be necessary to secure the employment of these men in the building of houses, especially having regard to the prevailing distress which is being occasioned by their prolonged unemployment by reason of trade union regulations which they have been unable to comply with owing to the fact that they were fighting for their Country."

 The Conference felt that if the Local Authorities were unwilling to make a stand all the Governments could do would be to express their willingness to help them to the best of their ability. The Government could not fight on bonus on output, they were not in a position to build themselves and all they would do was to support the Local Authorities.

 The Minister of Labour, the Minister of Health, the Secretary for Scotland and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Labour thereupon withdrew to draft a suitable reply. Upon their return after some further discussion the Conference agreed to the following reply:-

 
I agree withimy Honourable Friend that in this veryurgent malrfcor discuss!en has been long protracted,and that in view of the Veryserleus uneiaployaent,oB^ooia^Xly r9^on^st,-^XrS^TriJGG men-;- the natter must now be. brought, to a final conclusion.

^/ft7 F?TT t*F&apos;&apos;   (3)    The-0onfearenc.e .h-u^IAInS in africa.     &quot;Secretary of state for India (c.P. 2059),  together with a despatch from the Government of India to the secretary ^of State for India (c.P.2132) regarding the treatment of indians in the Kenya Colony and Kenya Protectorate.It was stated that a difference had arisen between theColonial office and the India Office regarding the treat-merit of Indians in this territory.    Since the war theColonial office had adopted a policy of segregation of-Indians, and heavy restrictions were imposed on them withregard to the ownership of premises and land.   Further,&apos;the Indians had been assigned an inferior politioal statusinasmuch as they had only two representatives on thelegislative council when the non-official Europeansh :-d eleven.    It was oontended that since the war the&apos;position of Indians in the pmpire had-deteriorated.In f tot,   the treatment that they received now in terri-tory recently owned by Germany was much worse than underthe-German3.    The claims made by the Government of india on behalf of the Indian community in p:enya were (l)  thatthe policy of race segregation should be abandoned.    Itwas a policy of disastrous interference In the vitaleconomic interests of the relatively large Indiancommunity on racial grounds and its adoption on these grounds was not only a new departure but was at variance with the traditional policy of the Imperial Government,and (2) thtit the Indian Community should be reassured asto its political  security by declaration that the policy&apos;of the Imperial Government contemplated their ultimateattainment of.     status of political equality withEuropeans.On the other hand it was stated that a policy of absolute equality between Indians and white settlers in east Africa was wholly    impracticable..  Furthc-r,  that .in comparing-the conditions of Asiatioe and &quot;urcpeima
no reference had. been made to the 5,000,000 native population which greatly out-numbered white and Indiansput together and who had no political status whatever,The attitude of the Colonial Office towards Indians hadnot suddenly become more oppressive - in fact the contrarywas the case.     Regarding the number of Indian representa-Ives on the Legislative Council, it. was pointed outthat the numberof representatives was really of minor importance as the Legislative Council would do nothingagainst the wish of the Imperial &apos;Government, and theIndian representatives had as much, chance as the whitesof making their views known.     With regard to the policyof segregation, Indians were free to go anywhere inthe whole country except In two respects.     -There was   acertain Highland area which was alone suitable for whitesto live In, from which Indians.were excluded but it wasnot known that they had ever expressed any real wish to gothere j and in. the towns there was an Indian quarter and. a white quarter.     This policy was not new since the war.,Inasfar as there had been any change recently it was ratherin favour of the    Indians.The Conference were reminded that the Indians ofIndia had put over 1,000,000 men into the field duringthe war and had helped to conquer German East Africa.We had stated that we wished them to help the Empire,but the moment they desired,, to take part in the trade ofthe Empire they were given notice that they were notwanted.    Such a position was difficult to maintain andwas an Indefensible one before the whole of our EasternEmpire.     The position would   have to be reconsidered,.The Secretary of State for the Colonieswas requested to consider the whole policy as regards the treatment of Indians Indifferent parts of the   Empire and toprepare, a Memorandum for the Cabinetgiving his views.
-OTAMIA (4) With, reference to Cabinet 70 (20), Conclusion lr theNORTHXA0 Conference, as a matter of urgency^ discussed with theSecretary of State for &apos;ar the general line ef the statements to be made by him and by either the Prime Minister or theLord Privy Seal on the subject cf &quot;Mesepotais ia and north persia the same afternoon.
(5) The Conference had before them a memorandumby the Secretary of State for the Colonies dealingwith a Bill to amend the Official Secrets Act 1911.(CP. 271)The Bill which was now before tho Bouse ofCommons has to be read as bno with the principal Actci 1911 and this Act applied to the whole Umpireincluding the Self-Governing Dominions.      Consequentlyif the present Bill passed the House of Commons weshould be legislating for the Self-Governing Dominions.The Secretary of State for the Coloniesproposed that a clause excluding the Dominions shouldbo inserted in the Bill.The Conference were reminded that legislation of the character proposed might not at all be suited to., the conditions of India and that in any case before such legislation there should be consultation withthe Government of India.from -The Conference agreed that the Billshould be amended so as to exclude.......the....Splf-Governing Dominions and .India      its scope, and thoAttorney General undertook tointroduce the amendment in the Houseof Commons.
