PROTECTION OF GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS AGAINST SINN FEIN ATTACKS.

With reference to Conclusion 10 of a Conference of Ministers held on November 25, 1920, the Conference had before them the First and Second Reports of the Emergency Committee (Papers C.P.-2167 and C.P.2183 respectively). In the Second Report it was stated that, when considering the question of the protection of the Houses of Parliament, the Police Authorities said that they could not guarantee the absolute protection of the Chambers in both Houses unless the public was excluded from all the galleries, with the exception of the Ambassadors&apos; Distinguished Strangers&apos; and Special Galleries. Short of this somewhat drastic step the following alternative precautions were suggested:-

(a) The searching of all persons admitted to Public Galleries and Committee Rooms:

(b) To exclude all women from the precincts of the House, and to admit men only to the Public Galleries.

The Police stated that the searching of women presented great difficulties, and unless the search was thorough it would be useless, and a thorough search would entail great inconvenience to the individuals concerned. The Police Authorities were in favour of closing the Galleries altogether.

The general feeling of the Conference was that it would be very unsafe to keep the Galleries open, owing to the impossibility of guaranteeing the safety of Members.

The Conference were informed that the recent outrages at Liverpool and the attempt at Ministry showed that the Sinn Feiners had definitely decided to carry their war of outrage into England, that the Sinn Feiners were known to be manufacturing bombs, and, further, that during the Coal Strike 30,000 detonators were stolen in Scotland.

The Conference agreed --

That the Speaker should make an announcement in the following terms that afternoon-

"After consultation with the Chief Commissioner of Police, I am satisfied that it is desirable to close all Galleries to which the public have access.

  
The Secretary ox State for -foreign affairs undertook to communicate with the LordGreat Chamberlain regarding similar pre-cautions to be taken in the Hou&apos;.e of Lordsorciens, S..lvvl., 1920c
