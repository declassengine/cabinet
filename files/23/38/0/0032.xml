(X) Arialng.out-.ef the Debates irvJParllament on theI^COAx. &apos; jpyevtjMifir ^ay^ the^Gcmferei**e-dis-euae^d the prospect8 ofsome means being found for a settlement.The Prime Minister described a conversation whichhe and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had had with Mr HerbertSmith and Mr Hodges as the result ef the good offices of a third party.   The Prime Minister had informed these miners&apos;leaders of the nature of the general statement he was about to make in the House of Commons, offering the Government&apos;sgood offioes towards bringing the parties together, on theunderstanding that there would be no Government subsidy andno control.   The miners&apos; leaders, if not acquiescing, did not suggest that this offer was without value. .Reference was made to various proposals made duringthe debates In Parliament, such as the possibility of anational settlement of district rates and measures to avertan abrupt and heavy fall of wages in particular districts,bu*&quot;- *er the moment discussion of these was considered to be premature.The Conference agreed -     . .(a) That the Prims Minister, on behalf of theGovernment, should immediately send ident-loal letters to the Mining Association andto the Miners&apos; Federation, calling attentionto his statement in the House of Commons onthe previous evening, tendering the good offices of the &quot;Government in bringing together the two parties to the dispute,and indicating that the other party wasbeing notified:(b) That an unofficial communication should bemade to the Transport Workers, who were-  meeting at the time, that these lettershad been sent.(The action snscified in- (a) and Cb)above was taken during the Meeting.)jfe. (8) Arising out of the previous discussion, the Confer-ence agreed -To invite the Board of Trade to circulate to the Cabinet a Memorandum setting out and explaining the true facts in regardto the mine--owners&apos; offer that theirprofits from the coalmines should belimited irv the first instance to 17 per cent,of the miners&apos; otandard wages in 1914,
and 20 per cent of the surplus profit,regarding which some animadversions hadbeen made lie the debate in the House ofCommonsw51      ,   (3)   With roferer.ce to Conclusion 3 of the Conference ofTORIALS.      Ministers held on April 5th, the Conference were informedthat, as the result of a consultation with the GeneralOfficers Commanding the Territorial Divisions., the ArmyCouncil were satisfied that, while no legal and binding pledgehad been given, it had beer, practically stated by thoseappealing for recruits that the Term&quot; tcrial Forces would xwtbe used for the maintenance of internal order.     This hadbeen reported to the Prime minister, who had referred thequestion to the Lord Chancellor^ Sub-Committee of the Supplyand Transport Committee,   . In the circumstances, the latterSub-Conmittee had cone to the conclusion that it would be inadvisable to take any steps towards calling up the TerritorialsForce, or to use that Force for the incorporation of ^-volunteers,Tliey had recommended the creation of a new Force, to be called&quot;The Defence Force&quot;, enlisted for 90 days, and subject to theArmy Act,     Sufficient forces could be raised within thenumbers provided by the Army Annual Act, 1920-21, up to April30th, but only a small force of some 20,000 to 30,000 men could be maintained within the numbers provided by the newArmy Annual Bill, *The Conference agreed -(a) To take note of, and approve in principle,the decision to create a new Force: and direct that all preparations should be made,(b) That, if possible, consideration in Committeeof the Army Annual Dill should be postpovmdfor a few days, in case it might be necessaryto Introduce amendments Increasing the strengthof the provision In the Bills(c) That the actual enlistment of the defence force should not be proceeded with, withoutCabinet sanetIon:(d) That no publicity to this proposal should bemade in the meantime,(4) With reference to Conclusion 2 of the Conference ofIlinistero held on April 5th, the Conference were informed
that, according to the latest information, all the Pifeshirecoal captaine were flooded and would probably require weeks forclearance.   The questions of pumping out these pits and pro-tectira the volunteers thus engaged would probably not ariseimmediately..Particulars were received during the meeting efdisorders in the Pifeshire coal district, and the conference were informed that the Secretary for Scotland had given ordersfor the arrest of the ringleaders *   No information was beforethe Conference as to whether the Battalion referred to at theprevious meeting had arrived in the district, or whether,having regard to other demands on the available forces, theGeneral Officer Commanding had been able to send them to Fife-shire.The Conference agreed -That it was essential, in the interests r.fpublic order, that the ringleaders shouldbe arrested and order, restored in the Fife-shire district.OODING IN        (5) The information as yet before the Conference did not!HER COAL-ELDS,        confirm the allegations in the Press as to extensive andmenacing flooding of mines in the South Wales Coalfield,ERGENCY ifi) The Minister of Transport consulted the Conference asTION.to whether immediate action should be taken under the threemine toade Gem-   following heads:-ssioners,(i) The issue of a preliminary warning to theosing of Roads Commissioners, who required 48 hoursgenta Park. to set their organisation in motion:A.0, and A.A.(ii)   The closing of Regents Park:Ranisation.(iii) A request to the Royal Automobile Club andthe Automobile Association to set in opera-tion their organisation.      If action werenet taken in this matter at once, there wouldbe considera as delay in the provision of any local services to replace tramways, omnibuses,etc., as 56 hours was required to set theorganisation in motion.   Moreover, if railway traffic and postal services were interrupted,the extent of the delay might be considerable.
After some discussion, the Conference agreed -IUTIOH&amp;oyalBiAYorsESjsIt of That a precipitate decision might prejudice the Railwaymen and Transport Workers, andthat a decision should be postponed untilthe same afternoon, when it was hoped thatthe position would be clearer.(7) With reference to War Cabinet 627, Conclusion 1, theConference, had before thorn a Pote by the Minister of Transport-covering a letter from the Chairman of the Railway GeneralManagers1 Committee, asking for authority to tell the RailwayCompanies to prepare for issue to the men, as soon as a strikewas declared, a circular letter similar to that sent out afterthe commencement of the Railway Strike in September, 1919.This circular contained a Government guarantee not only to afford protection to men who remained at work, but also tosafeguard their interests as railwaymen against any measuresor prejudice to which they might be exposed through rremaining at work (Paper CP,-2796).While recognising that such a guarantee would be far more useful If Issued before or simultaneously with the decisionto call tho men out than after a strike had commenced, theConference entertained doubts as to whether the Governmentwould be in a position to fulfil their guarantee, any in anycase felt that it would be premature and provocative to take any action in regard to it in the present position.3RII0HAL   (8)   The Conference were informed that a Private Member&apos;sISSPTATIOP.Bill, dealing with Proportional Representation, was due for debate In tho House of Commons on Friday next.The Conference agreed -That the Home Secretary, on behalf of theGovernment, should stato that Ministers. held divergent opinions on the subject,and that it was therefore proposed totake the Whips off,Mr. Shortt was to state at the same time that the Government could not allow a binding decision to be reached on a subjectof such far-reaching constitutionalImportance as the result of a private member^ Bill Introduced on Friday afternoon.
AT PWf^       (9)   Wlth refers,nce to Cabinet 9 (20), Appendix (1), th*&apos;^^on**erera^eC?md^J^^ the following documents relating to the question of home-grown wheat:-cfA Memorandum by the Earl/0rawford andBalcarres (P&amp;per CP.-2783),A Memorandum by the Minister of Agricul-ture and Fisheries (Paper CP.-2784),A Memorandum by Mr Chamberlain (paper cp.--2788).The.J3*western%m^K*o^ ^^&quot;c^mr ^Hx^ea^-dL^^JryjQx^^^O^is^y h^^J^eo^r.^iv^5-n,      the- farmers- -ui^der&quot;which, -thelatter were to receive 95/- a quarter for home-grown wheatof the 1920 crop.    It had, however, proved impossible to implement the pledge because the proposed machinery had broken down throuch the action of the merchants in repudiating theundertaking given by the President of their Association atthe Conference held on February 17th. last.    In the result,the financial benefits granted to the farmers by the arrange-ments approved by Cabinet 9 (21) were not, in fact, reaching the farmers.   Every possible means of inducing the merchantsto work the scheme had been tried without success.    The fact was that the merchants objected most strongly to any proposalswhich would involve disclosing their profits to the farmers.With regard to the question of cost, Lord Crawfordinformed the Conference that, so far as he was able to judge,the ache; e already approved by the Cabinet would involve an expenditure for the period November, 1920, to March, 1921, ofabout  700,000.    It was most difficult to estimate the addi-tional cost involved in the proposals contained in paragraph 3of his Memorandum (Paper CP.-2793), .but he did not anticipate that this additional cost would exceed  100,000 in respect ofthe period in question.He was satisfied that the figures given on page 3 ofUr- Ghssaoevl^ln&apos; g Memorandum (Paper CP.-27B8) were based on some misapprehension.*
.    .    - .    I 215The- G^mfBri?Tic*fv3rore- &quot;reminded that it would he necessaryto bring this additional expenditure before the House ofKlojEnronSy since it was not practicable to charge the moneyto the unspent balance of the Bread Subsidy :Vote for 192 -SL..The proposals would certainly be severely criticised, as it woube said that the Government were willing to subsidise the farmers but were refusing to subsidise other industries.On the other hand^ it was pointed out that there.had beena substantial profit made out of the Bread Subsidy operations,that it was most AiEp*iriiaJ3lvHih^ beoponr -to, .a^ry^harge- o-f^hreach of faith with the farmers, andthat, the * -greamant recently mada Tpa-A hnn-kf?n d.rrwrL.JTT)^.-^&apos;TTyv)i]gh-any fault of the farmers.The Conference agreed  (a) To approve the proposal contained in para-graph 3 of Paper CP,-2783, undor whichmerchants&quot; certificates should be recognised for the purpose of the Home-grown WheatScheme, precisely in the same way as millers&apos;certificates are recognised, on the under-standing that arrangements will be made tocertify the documeuty and safeguard theTreasury against fraudulent or improperclaims:and Lord Crawford(b) That the Minister of Agriculture/should con-suit with the Financial Secretary to theTreasury, with a view to seeing whet?aerarrangements are possible by which financial provision for the Home-grown Wheat scheme could be made without recourse to a Supple-mentary Estimate.S OP THF (10) The Conference had before them a Memorandum (PaoerART FORfJD.       CP.-2714) by the Lord Chancellor on the subject of theStatus of the Secretary for Scotland.The Conference were reminded of the pledges which hadbeen given from time to time to introduce legislation on thissubject, and also- that Mr Chamberlain had recently circulatedto the Cabinet a Memorandum (Paper CP.-2789) covering theReport of the Select Committee on, the Remuneration ofMinisters.After some discussion, in which it-was pointed outthat it would be most difficult to find time, for the passage
of an opposed Bill during the present Session, the conference agreed --(a) That the Lord Chancellor should reply toLord Linlithgow&apos;s question in the Houseof Lords to the effect that the Govern-ment had definitely decided to avoid, ifpossible, an Autuv. n Session, but that ifthe Bill altering the status of the Secre-ta&quot;y for Scotland was unopposed the Gov-errurent would undertake to pass it into law.    If, however, the Bill was opposedfrom any quarter, the Government couldnot undertake to find time for the passageof the Billi(b) That negotiations with possible opponentsshould be entered into on the above basis,with a view to the bill being treated asunopposed.eiCTTON (11) With referenoe to Cabinet 15 (21), Conclusion 3.GovernmentRAOTS TO the Conference approved that the Minister of Labour should,!S ON THI?,G&apos;S NATION- issue the following announcement recommended by a CabinetOIL.Committee (Paper CP.-2780) :-&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government has decided that,save in very exceptional circumstances, allfirms contracting for Government contracts to whorr the conditions for Membership ofthe King&apos;s Roll are applicable, must beon the King*s Roll.   This rule will comeinto operation on the 1st June, 1921.&quot;, Whitehall Gardens, S.*.l,April 6, 1921.?
