TURKISHONTROLAC ON.(1) The attention of the Conference was called to a tele-gram from the Viceroy of India, to the Secretary of State,quoting the following telegram published by the &quot;BombayChronicle&quot;:-&quot; .&quot;Prance and Italy are urging revision of turkish Treaty and restoration of Thraceand Smyrna to Turkey...   Lord Curzon, whor epr e sent a D rit i s h&quot;no no onfOrm1st conscience?is opposing frantically and is determined to destroy the- Moslem Empire and nation&quot;.The Secretary of State for India reported that, as requested by the Viceroy, he had, by arrangement with theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, telegraphed a dementiof this mal ielous rumour,.(2) With reference to Cabinet 15 (20), Conclusion 1, theConference had under consideration the following documents.  relative to the de-control of imported bacon:-Memorandum by the Food Controller(Paper CP.-2159),   -Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies (Paper CPa-2250),Memorandum by the Food Controller(Paper CP.-2270) ..The Conference were informed that an immediate decisioron the question of the continuance of control was required todeal with the situation which would arise in the next two orthree months,; when large supplies of new bacon would be comininto the market and would compete with the stocks of bacon,valued at about  7,500,000. held by the Ministry of Pood,which had been bought at prices higher than those which woulohave to be paid for tho coming supplies.   -Immediate de-contrcwould mean that the Ministry of Food would be left with large stocks of stale bacon, which could only be disposed ofgradually and at an estimated loss of  750,000.    On theother hand, i/ control was continued, as proposed by the  .Minister of Food in Pap-r CP.-2270, until February 28th, itwould be possible to liquidate the old stocks by making anarrangement with the distributing agents.
in CP.-2250Aoth. regard, to the question raised/by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies, the Minister of Pood explained thatthe entire Canadian output had been acquired by the Ministryup to the end of December, 1920, and that as approximately two months must elapse for Canadian bacon to be cured and toreach this country, his proposal would mean that there wouldbe a free market for Canadian bacon killed as from January 11921.Some discussion took place as to the financial effect of postponing de-control, and it transpired that, while theprice of bacon would probably fall in any case during the spring o^ 1921, it was almost certain that in the Summer of1921 the price might rise by an additional 8d,. per pound asresult of the removal of control.It was urged that as the consumer had had the advantages of cheap bacon for a considerable time, the. taxpayer should now be considered.&quot;The Conference agreed -That the Ministry of Food should forthwithapproach the distributing agents with aview to making an arrangement with the agentson the basis of the earliest possible abolition --tion of control, the cessation, of Governmentbuying, and the agents taking over theMinistry&apos;s stocksfailing a satisfactory arrangement being reached on these lines, .the Ministry of Pood.to be at liberty tocontinue its control of the importationof bacon until February 28, 1921.-2-
