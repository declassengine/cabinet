The Conference had. under consider- tion in connectionrrith the Coal strike tho question of tho continuance of thoguaranteed standard week for railwayman which was raised bythe minister of Transport as a natter of urgency,,     Under thoagreement with the railwaymen after the Failway Strike lestyear the Railway J-anagors had agreed to a guaranteed week of48 hours, but append d to this was a condition,;that in theevent of a strike affecting the work of any grade either generally or in any district the question of suspending theoperation of the guaranteed week should be referred to theJoint Committee of Managers and Representatives of the men.&apos;Upon the reduction of trains in consequence of the Coal Strikeit would not be possible t,6 find full employment for all those at present employed by tho Railway Companies, and it - wasApart from the possibility of continuing the guaranteed weeknecessary to determine what should be done,  /.the government might -(1)    suspend the guaranteed week and nay time andovertime according to the number of hours worked;(2)    discharge a sufficient number of men to enablethe Companies to keep the whole of the restfully employedj(5)    postpone a decision on the matter until after the debate in Parliament - on the following (Tuesday)afternoon,,It was pointed out that tho Joint Committee would meeton the following  (Tuesday) morning ana the railwayman&apos;s loadersno doubt hoped to have r decision to put before the meetingof delegates on &quot;odnesday, October 00th, and if the guaranteedweek were refused it was quite likely that tho &quot;iceting would recommend a strike.    - To keep all men on the standard week would, involve the railways in an additional cost of  500,000a week, .   which could, not be covered by tho nowrailway re.tes and would fall as a direct l$ss upon thoJhcchequiay.Tho opinion was expressed that it would he very difficultto keep tho railwayman at work if a decision on tho matter
were &quot;postponed, and that Mr, Cramp, who probably waited astrike, would be able to carry the day at the delegate-&apos;smeeting on   v^dnesday, and that, therefore, the continuanceof the guaranteed week should be promised.      On the otherhand it was pointed out that this would be a very great sign of weakness and that If the principle were agreed in thecase of the railwaymen It could not be refused in other employments *The general view was that as tho coal situation was tobe debated in the House of Commons on the following afternoon and the general situation with regard to the Coal strike had not yet had time to develop It would not be possible toplace a definite offer before the railwayman the next morning the Committee, therefore, agreedThat the Railway Managers should beinstmeted to say that it would beimpossible to make a definite arrangc-ment until after the Debate in the.House of Commons and tho further development of the Coal Strike;should ask the men to say what they thought would be a fair arrangement;and should propose a further meetingof the Joint Committee to bo held on saturday, October 25rd,2, &quot;hitehahl Gardens, o19th October 1920,o
