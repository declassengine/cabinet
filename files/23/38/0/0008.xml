THE LEAGUEOF NATIONSMEETING at brussels .INTER-allied and ANGLO-AMERICANDEBTS.THE STATUSCP EGYPT.(1) The Prime Minister, on behalf of his colleagues,congratulated and thanked Mr Balfour on the singularlysuccessful v/ay in which he had represented British inter-eats at the recent meeting of the Council of the Leagueof Nations at Brussels,  and more particularly in connectionwith the question of the Court of International Justice.(2) With reference to Cabinet 30 (20)., Conclusion 2,the Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that the questionof Inter-Allied and Anglo-A;. american debts had now becomeurgent, and he had asked that, it might be placed on the   .Agenda for that day.    In view, however, of the urgency of discussing the status of Egypt, he did not wish to press the matter, provided that it could be&quot; discussed at a very early date.The Secretary ?as instructed to place; the question on the Agenda Paper of thenext meeting of the Cabinet, on Wednesday next, November 3rd.(3) Lord Milner made a full statement.-to the&apos;Conferencein connection with the visit of his Special Mission to Egypt,and proposed recommendations regarding tlm- future status ofthat country.    A summary of this statement, as well as ofexplanations given in reply to certain questions, is givenin the Appendix.There was general agreement that if any Treaty wereto be enacted, it should prcvide, inter alia, that in caseswhere non-Egyptians were required to act in an advisory capacity as Government officials or officers, whether inthe Civil Administration or as Military Officers,  theyshould only be appointed with the consent of the BritishGovernment;    this provision being subject to exception inthe case of certain posts already reserved for non-Egyptianofficials of nationalities other than British, as well asin the case of Syrians, for whom, special arrangements
- would--have to be made.After hearing Lord Milner&apos;a statement,the Conference, a drummed the discuss ionuntil tho morning&apos; of Thursday next,November 4th.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I,November 1, 1920.
-    1.\ P? E 1211LORD MILNER said that he had been occupied for practicallyeleven months in considering the question of Egypt..    for four months it had taken up practically his whole time,  andfor seven months the greater part of it.    He thought thateveryone would admit that if Egypt were a friendly and alliedcountry which was decently governed and able to stand on itsown feet, and if it wore prepared to give us of its own accorda strategic base at all times and to place its harbours,railways, and oth cleans of communication at our service notonly in time of war but even in time of peace, it would bebetter,  ^rom the purely British point of view,  than if Egyptwere to be a British Possession, kept in subjection by forceand requiring in time of peace a.large permanent garrison.Be foresaw considerable danger if the present situation wereb comeallowed to continue, i---;t it should &apos;&apos;/   - a reproduction ofthat in Southern and Western Ireland, &apos;It was rapidlymoving that way, and quite heedlessly so.    The quarrel withthe Iris/, people was really a secular one, whereas in Egyptthe trouble was&apos; really &apos;a now one and was,  in his opinion,due to remedial causes.    He saw no reason why, with goodstatesmanship and patience, we should not get on the sametolerable terms with the Egyptians as we were twenty yearspreviously.    Even now there was no very bad feeling amongstthe greater number of people in Egypt towards the British.The Fellahin did not really caredfcout any relitioal7and this was even true of the Pe^ahinin the large to*ns.    In fact, it might be said that 90 percent, o*&quot; the people in Egypt did not take very mhoh Interestone way or tho other, and he was quite sure that a very largenumber of them did not know what the extremists were fightingfor.    To put it broadly, the Fellah     neither loved nor hatedus, and,as he had always been governed by somebody, he was
quite prepared tc acquiesce in being governed by us, so longas hm not his water and his crops -were not interfered with,and provided he ^as not stirred up against us by the socialsuperiors of his own race, and especially by the relijious/It might be asked, in these circumstances * what was the causeof the outbreaks which tcok place in Egypt last year?    these were, in his  (Lord Miner&apos;s) opinion, due to temporary causesTh-iy^/V^tf largely owe-to d       things which.went wrong in the government of thecountry during the war, when many of the best administratorswere ta&amp;en away;    also to the hardships which had to beendured in many cases,  and to the requasrtianrng ^tyiaoSur.All this had.-caused bad feeling.    The point he wished to emphasize, however, was that the Fellahin could be worked up against us by their social superiors;    and if we were to havepeace in Egypt and avoid having to maintain that peace bymartial law, it was not sufficient -to have 90 per cent, of* ready to    cquiicc - in our presence,  if left alone -the people / - it was- essential to get some of theremaining 10 per cent.   that was,  the. educated and semi-educated classes   on to -esasfcs-tee our side.    This he consider-ed essential,  for if we had some of the 10 per cent, on our side they could make opinion ana we could afford to leave therest.    In the years gone by we always had some of the middle and semi-educated classes who were favourable to british rule, and it had been the greatest shock to him, when hevisit-d Egypt,  to mind out what a change had taken place inthe country.    The Nationalist movement had only begun about15 yeara ago, and it.had been growing ever since.    There wasi.po, of course,  the unrest caused by the War and its inevit-. j.e results.He was not, however, going to labouthis point, as it would bo dealt with fully in the Final&apos;Report of his Commission;    but he did want to emphasise the
, nowstrength of the spirit of Egyptian NationaliseWcV^iaWtha 10 p-r cent,  of the population to which he was referring.Many men dreaded at heart the withdrawal of British influencefrom Egypt, but no man was prepared to stand up publicly and say that he was in favour of fee^rotectorate;no man was prepared to stand up and say that&quot;coruol te independence&quot;he did not want ./ If anybody was evensus p^ctPd of favouring in any way British rule, he was irrme-diately hauled ovor the coals and at once made to toe \)..oline and make a public confession of his orthodoxy.    T;-Sultan. himself had said once to Mm (Lord milner ) when heown&apos;-was talking of his^weakness and unpopularity, that he cruld.-b*the most popular ran in Egypt on the following day if &quot;he.followed the example of the Princes and agreed with theirmanifesto.    It would thus be seen that we were up against -a.,solid phalanx of Egyptian opinion, and in his (Lord Milner&apos;s)-view, if we were to keep any control over the country other--wise than by martial law we must break up the 10 per cent\ of the  more educated classes and g--.t some of the&apos;-&apos; on our side,-wen if, in order to do so, it was necessary to make some-noti-slderable sacrifices.    In the opinion of the      Mission ofwhich he was Chairman, it would be possible to re-establishgenuine co-operation between tho British and Egyptians inthe government of Egypt by giving to the latter, who forwo had profossed to b--1 tm-ininsr tqforty years past / &apos; govern themselves^.....the same independent status which we contemplated giving tothe much less civilised Arabs in Mesopotamia after a muchshorter period of tutelage.    Ke noticed that tho Secretaryof State for India had suggested that his      jj/rission had beenbargaining with, the Egyptian extremists.    This was not so.Adly Pasha was essentially a moderate, and was not at allanti-British;    he had be-on more instrumental in bringing about/eonversa^ons/than^nfnother man in Egypt, and hadin his (Lord Milner&apos;s)  opinion the best political head in
that  country.    All the men with whom the/had been carryingon conversations belonged to the .old Hisb^/Cmma, a partyfavoured, and it might almost be said created, by Lord Crosier.Zaghlul himself was one of Lord Grower&apos;s men.    The Hisb *el-Omma party used to be at daggers drawn with the Hisbe^7Watani,which was really the anti-British party.    The mistakes which.   J ^ - Egyptianshad been made by us had. led the /to think that v-e meant to destroy entirely their nationality and their individualityas a oeoole, and to swallow them up in the British Ei pire.This feeling had brought the two parties together, and all nonjoined in the cry of &quot;No Protectorate&quot; and &quot;Long live com-plete independence&quot;.    As always happened in such combinations,the extremists got the upper hand, but the deep underlyingdifference was still there.    On the one hand there wars thosewho ,neither thought they could do without us nor wanted to try, and who knew that if left to themselves they would fallunder some other much less lenient domination, These menstill wanted to lean upon the British, but not as subjects.They wanted to be able to hold their heads up in Egypt andwho war&quot; really anti-Britishnot to appear less patriotic than the extreme men /     he himself had bean one of those who had recommended, after thenot        EgyptianWar, that His Majesty&apos;s Government should/receive anDelega-tion in London,   but he how realised that the refusal had done a good deal of harm and/had given colour in Egypt to the idea that we not only wanted a Protectorate but that our intention was to absorb Egypt entirely into the British Empire.. LORD question pointed out that His Majesty&apos;s Govern rent had never declined to receive Egyptian Ministers, but that theywere not prepared to receive Zaghlul,&apos; who was the leader ofthe party which --as working against British rule.    TheMinisters had refused to co-e without Zaghlul, and the pro-posed journey to London accordingly fell through.LORE MILN^R, continuing, said that the main effort of hisnlssion had been directed towards finding a settlement which, alike in form and in substance, would allow that
section of the core educated Egyptian   classes which was        ^2not irreconcilable again to becc1 e our friends.    It wasnecessary to  take into account the self-respect and nationalself-consciousness of the   EgyptaWr. one eight say,theitjecnoeit;    and that was why the term &quot;Ei-lateral Agreement&quot;had been used, as it implied the frank recognition of theirnationality, of their having retained or regained a place oftheir own &quot;in the sun&quot;, their relation to us being that of allies, not subjects or fellow-citiseno.    Throughout thediscussions phraseology and face-saving had played an enormouspart, as the       isissicn realised that they were dealing withOrientals and with children, very cle-er and potentially verynaughty children, but also people who, once they were con-vinced of our sincerity ana real good will towards them, were very manageable.    Some doubt had boon expressed as to whatwith whom the :&apos;:iesien had dealt n&amp;m ktifextent the     Egyptians/represented Egyptian opinion. &apos; Therewas no.question that they had every conceivable credentialthat unofficial emissaries could ha^e.    Ther--: was practically no public body in Egypt which had not passed     resolutionssaying that Zaghlul represented their views, and there wasno* a &quot;oiCR raised on th^ other side.    This was, however, whenZaghlul and his colleagues were supposed to advocate theextreme national demand.    The real question was how they wouldbe received when they went back to Egypt to advocate the per-manent maintenance of a British Army in Egypt and the psrman-ent concentration of the exceptional rights of foreigners inBritish hands,  typified by the dropping of the famous predi-   icate &quot;complete&quot; from, the formula &quot;independence&quot;.    So far ashe (Lord L-Iilner) could make out, however, their proposalsswept the board ..&apos; It did not follow. that this feeling would continue, but he thought it reasonable to saythat the dominant feeling of hostility against the Britishin wgypt had bA^n broken.    The old fissure was once moreapparent, and it was wider than ever.    &quot;Entente&quot; was theorder of the nay.   md for the irorent the party of &quot;Entente&quot;
had completely got the upper- hand.     The practical question was whetherthe price which the Mission was prepared to recommend&apos; Great britain to pay for this separation of the sheep from the goats was too high.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affaire had quite clearly pointedout its weak points.     It had always noon made perfectly clear to. the egyptians with whom his (Lord milnor&apos;a) mission had boon dealing,- -that Hi;; Majesty&apos;3 Government wore not committed in -any way, althoughho personally and his colleagues were committed to advocating a settlo-ment on tho lines laid down in their memorandum of August last.THE PRIME MINISTT2R said he would like Lord Milnor to give a picture of what ho thought would bo achieved under his proposals.     Ho wondered whether the Egyptians would bo prepared to take advice now in the same way as they did twenty years ago, for it must bo ro:cmbcrod that atthat time tho situation was very different.     For example, the egyptian government could not got any money, whereas now they probably would think that they could raise a loan just as well as anyone olscLORD MILKER said that his idea was that, under his scheme, thesituation wotild revert to what it was twenty or thirty years ago, whentho British Government had much loss actual power in Egypt but muchgreater influence     Under the present arrangement tho want of co-operation between British and Egyptians threatened to bring thingsentirely to a standstill, and he thought wo would get much greater efficiency   if we gavo up direct control and relied mono on Influence.&apos;He did not think that anyone doubted for a moment that the Egyptians-would have to have some foreign help, and that they would preferBritish to any other *     But they cortai&amp;ly wanted greater freedom.to run their domestic affairs on their own linos,     Bhon he had beenin Egypt previously, we confined ovir direct action to finance andirrigation.     It wao a later and much more doubtful development when we began to take charge of all branches of administration especially the Interior.
A short di sous si on then ensued regarding the system whichhad been in vogue in Trpypt in years gone by,  during whichit waa pointed out that His Majesty 3 Government exercised avery great control,  in so far as they only allowed those ministers to be appointed who were prepared to carry out apolicy in accord with the British point of view.    The point was al30 raised as to what extent it would &quot;be necessary, unucrthe proposals for the Egyptian Government to take the advice of the British officials in Egypt,  and as to whether, if they wanted an engineer or a man to run the rail-ways,  it -would bepossible to insist on their employing British officials andnot trench or American; and,  again,  as to whether,  if they wanted officers for the Egyptian Army,   they might not saythat the French knew much more about military matters thanthe British and that they wanted to employ French officers.LORD MILN^R explained that, under the general lines of thescheme as already outlined,   this was not expressly barred,  butit certainly would not be in accordance with the spirit of theAgreement that British officials should be replaced by otherforeigners.    He believed that, the Egyptians would readily agreeto give a pledge to that effect.LORD curzon,  in reply to a question by the Prime Minister,explained the system of control over Native states in india as regards their military forces and the employment of foreignofficials.   He suggested that in the case of Egypt the best way would surely be to lay down certain, conditions,  and ex-pressly to state that if foreign officers were required theycould only be appointed with the concurrence of Kis Majesty&apos;sGove rnment.MR. BONAR LAW asked if anyone could say what views were held by British officials,  at present serving in Egypt,  on lord Milner&apos;s proposals.   He would like to know,  for example,wa3 opinion unanimous that they would not work?, -  7 r
LORD ALLENBY said that he thought opinion was unanimousthat something in-the nature of Lord Milner&apos;s scheme wouldhe quite workable, but he would like to point out that thisview was held before the scheme provided for representation in Vreigp countries, and he thought most of the british officials in Egypt would be very shy of this provision.LORD MILNER said he did not  thinkthat the system under which an Egyptian Minister hadcontrol, with British Civil Servants working under him,would not work.    Egypt remained overshadowed by Britishpower,  and he believed they were much better disposed to usthan to anyone else.    There was also the question of theaccessibility of Egypt by sea, and with our sea power we could do practically what we liked strategically.    Moreover, by her own act we were to have a permanent base in Egypt.   As regardsit must be rerr-&apos;ered that under th* pro nosed scheme the possibility of foreign intrigues in Egypt,/  he wasto have an Alliance with us, and with us. only.Ma- BQNAP. LAW thought that, with good will on the part ofthe Egyptians, the proposed scheme might work, but if not,it appeared to him to be hopeless.    He very much doubted 4 th.   fourteen foreign Bowers who had Capitulatery rights would be willing to agree to the proposals.    He did not think,for a - moment that if the British Government were in theplac&quot; 0+&quot; one of these Bowers they would do so.Some discussion then ensued,   during which considerable doubt was expressed as to how, under the proposed scheme,  itwould be possible to prevent the.French or any other foreign power from intriguing&quot;in Egypt and gradually strengtheningtheir position.The question raa also discussed as to the extent to which.His Majesty&apos;s Government would be responsible for providingtroops for the maintenance of internal order in Egypt andthe protection of the property of foreigners in. the case ofthe Egyptian Army proving unreliable.
It v-as- also^oarrte^ never be-exac-tly-what it was in years gone by, and that, after allthat had passed, the present and future High commissioners in Egypt could never hold the sane position as Lord Cromerhad in the past.LORD MILKER said that there was only one thing which he still intended to say when certain questions had been asked.He had been very careful to impress on the Egyptian-Delegatiothat he was talking qua Mission, and could not speak.for theGovernment any more than the Egyptian del-gates could speakfor the Egyptian Government.    He was of opinion that his Mis-sion was committed to reporting in favour of some scheme onthe lines indicated in their Interim Report, but His Majesty&apos;Government wore, of com so, not committed in any way.   Hishope, however, was that they right see fit to approve, withcertain reservations, relations with the Egyptian Governmenton the lines contemplated, rather than on the lines of the relationship of a Colony or Proh ctorate to the Home Govern-ment.    The next step w^uld have to.be to appoint representa-tives on both sides to draw up some formal document.    SuohTreaty wh&amp;n drafted would have  to/3ubffiitted to the EgyptianAssembly.    Regarding reservations, he had looked through Lord..Curzon&apos;s remarks, and he thought most of his proposals were quite in accordance with the spirit of the scheme.    Therewere, however, one or two of them which, if adopted, mightupset it altogether.    Regarding the military forces to beretained in Egypt, and the keeping open of our lines of cora-munication to.the ^ast, he did not think that this had beenvery clearly expressed in. the Memorandum.    The basis of thewhole thing was an Alliance in which we guaranteed Egyptianindependence and the sending of an Army to protect Egypt  if need be;    in return for this we demanded a valuable op id pro,,ouo, namely, that in war all her local resources should beplaced at our&apos; disposal;    and, further, that we should have apermanent military base in Egypt.
2, Whitehall Gardens, 3.W.1,November 1,- 1920.Hega rdingthe point raised by Lord, Our son in connection with officers other than British serving in the Egyptian Amy, he did notthink that anyone had ever contemplated that any hurt british officers should be employed.    If was merely a question ofthe form in which the Agreement should bo drawn up.    Itmight be made a general principle that any foreigner employ-ed in the Public Service&apos;&apos; in Egypt must be a Britisher, er&quot;Ise appointed with the consent of the British Government,He did not think a stipulation of this s**rt would entirelyupset the agreement, and it would be possible to get them toagree to it.A short discussion then took place with regard to the best means of further considering the question, during which itwas pointed out that, as the hauling down of the British Flagin Egypt and turning Egypt into an Independent State was avery serious proposal, it was desirable that the general principles should be decided before th. details were dia-cussed.The Conference agreed to adjourn thediscussion until the morning of Thursdaynnxt, November 4th.
