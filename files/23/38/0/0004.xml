AHTjATBS.-^. (1) With r^Torerrce^^ Ca^net^54- (20) ^ J3ora3us-Lon 9,^th^KnrfVrwc-^ had before them the following documents   &apos;relating to the present position of Mandates:- &quot; &quot;A Note by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, covering Revised Drafts   1 -o f Mandates (Paper 0.P.-1896):A Letter fron. the Foreign Office to theSecretary to the Cabinet (Paper L.N.C.-6):A Letter frorc the Foreign Office to theSecretary to the Cabinet (Paper L.H.C.-7):A Letter from the President of the Councilof the League of Nations to the PrimeMinister (Paper L.N.C.-8):A Draft &quot;One-Clause&quot; Mandate (Paper L.LI.0 ,-10).Mandates. . The Conference were inforced that it was most desir-able that the British Mandates for Mesopotamia and Palestine,an?  the wr-ench Mandate for Syria,  should be in&apos;substantiallyidentical terms.    The Mesopotamian Mandate had been&quot; held upfor Sir Percy Cox&apos;s vie-a, which had just been received, andfron; which it appeared that Sir Percy Cox generally favoured the Revised Draft and thought that its publication would serve a useful purpose.    It was now proposed to submit the threeMandates in question at the earliest possible date to theCouncil of th--- League of Nations direct.    This course wouldprobably avoid difficulties which Japan might raise if, ashad b-.-en originally indended,  the Mandates were submitted tothe Allied Powers for approval before being brought beforethe League.Attention was drawn to the somewhat rigid characterof this Revised Draft Mandates  (Paper 0.P.-1896) and to thefact that they imposed duties and obligations on theMada-toryof a nature which might unduly fetter liberty of action andprove unworkable in practice.    In particular, it was pointedout that it would not be open to Great Britain to raise Arab   Itroops for the general defence of the Empire, even if theArabs were willin-to fight outside Mesopotamia.      It wasalso thought very desirable that Great Britain should retain the right tc prrenoruid a claim to be reimbursed her heavy
 Mosopotamian expenditure should the circumstances hereafter justify the making of such a claim. In these circumstances it was suggested that it might be preferable to submit to the League a provisional Mandate in vague and general terms, suoh as the "One-Clause" Draft of L.H.C. 10, which might be superseded by a more elaborate document when experience had shown the extent to which it was necessary or desirable for the Mandatory to try to restrict her liberty of action in certain definite directions.

 On the other hand, it was pointed out that the League and public opinion had been awaiting formal documents for a long time. The Council of the League would not accept a One-Clause Mandate, and as the Government was pledged in any case to an elaborate document in the case of Palestine it would be most difficult to defend a totally different type of document for Syria and Mesopotamia. The military and trading provisions of the Mesopotamian Mandate had been drafted with particular reference to the Syrian Mandate, which should be in identical terms.

 It was generally felt that the Syrian Mandate would probably in any case be interpreted by the French to meet their own requirements, and that it was desirable to insert words enabling the Mandatory, wit the consent of the Local Government, to employ local troops raised in Mesopotamia and palestine for purposes other than the maintenance of order and the defence of the respective territories.

 In the course of further discussion, the Conference were informed that the latest reports about Mosopotamian oil were not encouraging, and it was generally agreed that the only hope of recovering some part of our heavy expenditure would be in the event of the oil fields being successfully exploited. It was probably out of the question, however, to look for recoupment of purely military expenditure prior to the armistice.


The- l^mrf ^r^^Atvg-reedi-(a) To approve the Draft Revised Mandatesfor Palestine and lieSKrp-^amia (paper.P,-1896)  subject to modification inthe following particulars:-(i)  The insertion,  in the appropriateArticles of the Mandates for Meso-potamia and Palestine,  of provisionsenabling the Mandatory, with theconsent of the local Government,  toer.ip3.oy local forces otherwise than for the maintenance of order and thedefence cf the mandated territories:. (ii)  The addition to Clause 14 of theMasopotamie.n Mandate, and Clause 0 of v.he Palestine Mandate, of aprovision enabling Great britain to clarxi to be reimbursed for herexpenditure in maintaining lav/ andorder since the Armistice,  and alsothe value af railway, irrigation andother plant handed over to the Meso-potamian and Palestine Governmentsrespectively,(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should inform the French Govern-ment nf the modifications which the cabinet had decided to introduce into the Mesopota-mian and Palestinian Mandates, with a viewto similar amendments being introduced intothe Syrian Mandate:(e) that in the event of the French Governmentagreeing to these modifications,  the.Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should communicate with Mr Balfour, in brussels,  so that in collaboration with&apos; &apos;   - M, Bourgeois the three Mandates in ques--   tion might be laid before the Council of*&quot;he League on an early date.For the rsaoons subsequently stated in CP.2013the Secretary of Stato for India lissantod from the aboveconclusion giving general approval to the rovisod draftMandate for Mesopotamia.
"B" and "C" Mandates.

The ? took note that the "B" and "C" Mandates had been allocated as follows:-

German East Africa .......... Great Britain and Belgium.

West Africa (Togoland and Cameroons) .......... Great Britain and France.

German South-West Africa ......... Union of South Africa.

German Possessions in Pacific South of the Equator (except Samoa and Nauru) ................ Commonwealth of Australia.

Nauru ............................ British Empire.

Samoa ............................ New Zealand.

German Islands North of the Equator ...................... Japan, and that a description of boundaries is only necessary in the cases of the two East African Mandates and the four Mandates respecting Togoland and the Cameroons. These boundaries have been settled in agreement with the Belgian and French Government respectively.

The Conference agreed -

That the facts as to the allocation of "B" and "C" Mandates should be communicated to the League of Nations, together with the information that these territories are being actually administered by the Mandatory Powers peni?ng the definite settlement of the terms of the Mandates.


(2) The Conference had before then- a Mem-srandu; - by the^ocret&amp;ry of State for the Colaniea (Paper L.N.0.-9)&quot;relative to the proposals of the Sooretaxy^emeral of the League ofNations for a rer^anent Commission of Control under Article22, para. 9 , of, the Covenant.It was pointed out that this paragraph provider) ftr aPermanent Commission t) receive end examine the annual reports of the Mandate ries and to advise the Council sn all matters relating-to the observance of the Mandates.    Thedraft scheme drawn up by the Secretary-General provides fora Commission of Control of 15 members, ? ef who.m will repre-sent the Mandatories and 0, -who will be nominated by otherGovernments and chosen by the Assembly, will not.The Conference were informed that the Dominions had as yet had m opportunity - of considering the proposals,  towhich they might object, not only because of the Mandatories&apos;minority representation, but because the view might be taken that. the. jroposed-Commission of Control goes altogether beyondthe scops and purpose of Article 22 of the Covenant.The Conference agreed  That the Council of the League should beinformed that His Majesty&apos;3 Government wasnot in a position to accept the proposals contained in the draft scheme far the organ-isation of the Commission of Control untilthe Dominions had had full opportunity of considering those proposals and statingtheir views upon them.
r   )33FUTURE STATUS (3)    The Conference had before the    a Note by theOF ARMENIA.Secretary to the Cabinet  (Paper C.T.-1828)  covering a copyof a letter from the Secretary-Gen?.ral to the League ofNations, transmitting a resolution respecting the.future status of Armenia, which had been adopted by the Council ofthe League,  and also a Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (Paper CP.-3970) drawing attention to the decisionof the Supreme Council at San Retro&apos; on April 26, 1920, thatthe Allied Powers were i:nahle to assist Armenia otherwise than by the despatch 0*&quot; arm? and munitions, and stating thathe was strongly opposed to committing Great Britain to participation in an international guarantee of any Loan,whether for Armenia or for any other of the countries whichwould at once be encouraged to make similar demands.It - -as agreed  That Great Britain should not of for toparticipate in any financial guarantee to be civ en to Armenia by the membersof the League of Fations, and thatobjection should be taken to any such proposal being submitted by the Councilto the Assembly of the league.
PERMANENTCOURT CP IN-TFRNATIONALJtFSTXOC(4) With reference to Cabinet 5? (20), Conclusion. 11, theConference had before them the following documents relatingto&apos; the draft so he. &quot;e for the institution of a permanent Courtof International Justice, proposed by a Commission set up bythe League of Nations, to be considered this weeh by theCouncil of the League, as provided for in Article 14 of theCovenant:-A Note by the Secretary to the Cabinet,covering a copy of, a letter from theAc tin? secretary-Qeneral of the League,of Nations (Paper 0.P.-1339):A Note by the Secretary to the Cabinet,covering a copy of a letter from theForeign Office (Paper CP.-1902):A Memorandum- by the Attorney-General(Paper CP.-1905) :A Memorandum by the Lord I resident of theCouncil (Paper C.P.-19SG):A Memorandum by the lord Chancellor andthe Lav/ Officers (Paper CP,-1962):A Memorandum by the Sees et&amp;ry-Generalof the League of Nations  (Paper CP.-1974).The following objections were urged against the drafts cheme:-(i) The sohere is compulsory:    that is to say, it roes %r beyond Article 14 of the Covenant,which only &apos; con templates a scheme for a $vuirtto hear disputes which the parties theretomay voluntarily submit to its jurisdiction.(ii) The scheme is detrimental to us as a Sea Power,since it would enable predominantly Land Powersto build up a Code of International Lav; which  -would fetter the exercise of ova1 seapower.      Unless.precautions w.--re taken toprevent its application being made rerro-speetiv^&apos;,  it- would even enable appeal to bemade against thm decision of our Prise courts in the late War.&apos; (iii) Even if.it was gen; rally  recognised that decisions of the Court in particular casesdid not constitute future precedents,  the factthat the- Court had giver e decision might seriously hamper Great Britain in a futurewar and -strengthen the position, o-&apos; neutralStates against her.There was general agreement that the scheme, asit stood,was highly detrimental to our national interests
It was then pointed out that, since sooner or laterGreat Britain would have to define her attitude towards thewholp question, it might be best to state bluntly that, as a nation entirely, dependent on sea power, we reserved full discretion regarding the submission of maritime questions to the jurisdiction of an International Court.    The decisions ofthat Court might go far to destroy the offensive value of theBritish Fleet.    The Blockade was the most tremendous weaponever forged,, and to a certain extent it involved the denial of justice to Neutrals,    Even if Great Britain could not be forced into an arbitration, it was clear that our positionwould be prejudicially affected if, as was likely, we were forced hereafter into action v.hich was notoriously in defiance of decisions come to by the International Court.The.Conference were reminded that the Anglo-Saxon mindhad more regard, to the value of precedents than the Continent-al mind, and that- the distinguished persons who framed thescheme had no practical experience of the difficulties which arose out of legal disputes between States.    It was suggestedthat the whole scheme should be referred back to , the drafting committee to exolore the practical difficulties-, and that the-8- 1could.not be accepted, and the. question resolved itselfone of procedure..  The.following arguments were advanced(1) The British Government Imd never undertaken toaccept any particular scheme, and could not be. .bound by the action of the British represents-. . five on the Drafting Committee, who had been selected,not by the British-Government, but bythe League of Nations.(2) The British Government Wad .entitled to have timeto discuss the question with the Dominions..In this connection, however, it was pointed outthat there had been ample time for such eonsult-ation, and that to use this particular argument,having regard to the fact that the Empire hadsix votes in the Assembly, was not politic.(55) The United States of America are still outsidethe League, and consequently outside the scheme,There was,&apos; therefore, a risk that one Code ofInternational Law might grow up or one side ofthe Atlantic and another Code on the other.This would vitiate the whole scheme- ab initlo.
best solution might be found in having an international court sitting in Chambers, rith special expert Judges ad hocdealing rith different matters, such as maritime business,1ah our &amp;:sou t*s, etc.In this connection the Conference were reminded of-the danger which might arise through the League of Nationspropounding plans which no individual Government would beprepared to endorse.    The League of Nations Secretariatshould be a Post Office between the League vnd the various governments, and. should not of its own accord initiate action.Otherwise the Governments might &quot;find that they were notmasters in their own houses.The Conference generally agreed  -(a) That the aehere was unacceptable from aBritish point of view:(b) That thfi compulsory aspects of the schemeshouId be resisted:(c) That delay should be insisted on, on theground that the scheme could not be putinto operation without the co-operationof the United States of America.

&apos; &apos; &quot; 37IpOLAWT ANTj (5) Ther-^lo-rrfermc^&quot;-o-f &quot;the-attitude to be adopted by the British representative on the Council of the League of Nations in relation to thedispute between Poland and Lithuania. &quot;The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs statedthat he was not satisfied that the Polish Government hadconnived at tho occupation of Vilna, and pointed out thatafter tho British and French ministers had made jointrepresentations on the subject to the Polish Governmentthe latter had definitely repudiated in the Diet the actionof General Zeligowski.    Subsequently, Marshal Pilsudski hadentirely associated himself with Zeligowski&apos;s troops and hadoxpr^ssfd his intention to resign and throw- in his lot withhis compatriots.    This attitude could not be disregarded, asPilsudski was still a power to be reckoned with in Poland.As - a result of Lithuanian remonstrances, the League ofNations had taken up the matter,, and to. Bourgeois was vigor-ously insisting on the evacuation of Vilna.    The French plan was  o get rid of Pilsudski,  to exact a definite pledge ofgo-od behaviour from the Polish Government, and then leavethe questions of the evacuation of Vilna and the &quot;future of.Pc.lis.h-Ld.thiianian. relations to he settled by the League ofyNations.    It might be possible&quot;  to solve the Vilna difficultyby means of a plebiscite, and negotiations for a unionbetwoon Poland and Lithuania were not wholly out of thequestion.On the other hand, it was urged that whatever line the Polish Government might take-, it- was unlikely that thePolish, people would disavow the act of the army. . If itappeared, in the course       the next few days, that thePolish troops at Vilna were being reinforced or sustainedfrom Poland, it would       clear that Poland was defying theAllies and the League of Nations.    The proper course wouldthen be to tu:n her out of the League-and-decline-any longer--to preserve her territorial integrity.
It was generally &quot;rf^^gru.3ed. that in this matter it wasrasst desirable to act in close co-^operatlon with the FrenchGovernment, and in this connection it was pointed out thatLI* Bourgeois, although not a Minister, was in the close-confidence of his Government and in that, of k. Millerand.It was agreed --That Mr Balfour should have full authorityto deal, on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, with the Polish-Lithuanian -.sjueation.
jfe^??2s?, (6) Tbe 0^^ev.ae hzA before the- a Note by theSeore-lORGAi j 1 SAT 10 N$1 lll^; Qm ta3T t0 th* Cabinet (Paper CP1968) covering, a Memorandumon thp Economic Organisation of the league of Nations, whichhad been prepared by the Board of Trade.In this He; memorandum it was urged that the characterof the economic questions to be dealt with called for aConference o- Committee of Ministers of the various Statesresponsible for dealing with Trade and Industry, assisted,1.*&quot; and when thot!-ht necessary, by expert advisers, but thatthe Conference or Committee should not comprise irresponsibleindividuals selected ad hoc, how ever competent or eminent.The Committee or Conference should not deal with Economic and finance questions, but should be concerned exclusively with commercial and Economic questions.    If necessary, a separateCommittee should be established to deal with Finance questions,leaving any adjustments of overlap to mutual discussion and joint Cocmittees.    The Economic Conference or Committee should deal with questions, on Trade,    Industry and Shipping, exclud-in.:-.: Finance-, labour, and Transit and Communications, otherthan Merchant Shipping, and should, in the first instance,consider the s+^ps to be taken to stive effect to the variouseconomic obligations imposed on the League under the treaties of Peace, so far as they fall within the scope of the Ccnfer-ence or Committee.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that theTreasury entirely concurred in the vie-s expressed in theBoard of trade Memorandum.The Conference took note of, and approved,the&quot;recommendations contained in the foardof Trade Memorandum.
OP NATIONS.TRUSTS.(^^m^&amp;K^m^o^ IfS^nafes ^ms22 fem*i^^&amp; ibte &quot;by the&apos;*&apos;i3w3Se*carry- to the Cabinet (Paper CP.-1950) covering a Memo-randum by the Board of Trade respecting a proposal of H.Tittoni that the Council of the League of Nations should   -bring before the Assembly the question of giving effect tothe provisions of Article 23 (e) of the Covenant,As regards procedure,  the Board of Trade consideredthat action under the Article as proposed would be prematureand provocative,    that the questions could best be discussed at a Conference of the responsible Ministers for Trade andIndustry,    but that  the time was not yet ripe for the negotia-tion of an International Commercial Convention, and that It^as most undesirable that the League of Nations should estab-lish any Committee or organisation to deal with international economic questions other than on the lines suggested above.The Memorandum, then proceeded to discuss the questionof the cont ol of international combinations and of monopol-ies of essential materials.The- Conference took no + e &quot;of, and approved,the recommendations and suggestions con-tained in the Board cf Trade Memorandum.BRITISH RE-PRESENTATIONON THE COUN-OIL OP THELEAGUE.(8) With reference to Cabinet 55 (20), Conclusion 1, theConference agreod  -That a statement should be made in theT&quot;ouse of Commons that Lord Grey had-declined,on grounds of health, the PrimeMinister&apos;,3 invitation to bo one of theBritish representatives- at the forthcoming. meeting of the Council of the League ofNations.
T.TSH S*TRTSAI.S.  (9)   ithr reference to the fcrthconing Debate in theHouse of Lords, to be initiated by Lord Grewe, the Confer-ence were informed that the Chief &quot;Secretary for ireland was preparing a SHemoranduiu dealing with the whole questionof reprisals.It was agreed --That a request for an Enquiry intoReprisalst. except an Enquiry tinder-taken by the Government itself, shouldbe refused.2, v&apos;hi t ohal 1 Gard sns, S.&apos;&quot;;. 1,October IB, 1920.
