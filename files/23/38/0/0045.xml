!aEARATION.      1.    With reference to Cabinet 29 (21) Conclusion 39Pjrojjoja^ freshproposals with regard to the payment of Separation byGermany which had emerged from discussions during thelast few days between the cabinet Committee on reparations and M. Loucheur and Colonel Theunls.Sir laming Worthiogton-Srans gave the Conference an outline of this soheme which had not yet been reducedto writing, but oopias of which it was hopod would beavailable later in the day.Tho new proposals generally commended themselves tothe Conference, but it was very strongly represented that the scheme for collecting 50$ of tho value ofImports from Germany in cash in the importing country andearmarking the amount so collected in partial satisfactionfor that country&quot;e reparation claims should be inoorpor-ated in the new proposals.     It was pointed out that itwould be most dangerous for Groat Britain to assent to any scheme which might have the effect of giving franco,Belgium and Italy substantial roparation while denying itto herself, and that in the absenoe of most completeassurances and guarantees that Great Britain would get herfair share of Reparation, no steps should be taken to give up the 50$ scheme.The Conference were informed that it would bepossible to incorporate the 50$ scheme in the new proposals by treating the 50$ as reparation in kind and &quot;by handing over to the German Government German ac? 1 bonds-equivalent in value to the cash actually co Hooted.     The surest ionwas made without objection being taken that the 50$ couldbe x )        a-1- &apos;
be reduced to. 25$ if Germany voluntarily accepted this as one of the methods of paying Reparation.Objection was taken to the suggestion for including the50$ in the new proposals, on the ground that it would placeBritish traders at a disadvantage vis-a-vis German trade ascompared with traders of countries which had not imposed thepercentage arrangement.   It was also represented that if the50$ scheme was incorporated in the new proposals this should bedone in such a way that the proceeds would be credited to theCaisse la Dette and debited to the collecting country by way ofinterest, rather than that the amount collected should be treatedas Reparation in kind.   While it was generally recognised thatthis latter suggestion would in effect provide a satisfactory method of regulating exchange, doubts were expressed as towhether such an arrangement was administratively possible.It was agreed -(i) that the 50$ on imports should not begiven up unless and until the BritishGovernment was entirely satisfiedthat the British Empire would receiveher ifair share of Reparation by some&apos;  other method.(ii) that the members of the ReparationCommittee should give further consider-eration to the question of the basis on which tho 50$ sulwno should be incorporated in the proposals.A copy of the new proposals as subsequently settled by the Secretary ot State for War Is attached (See Annex).
