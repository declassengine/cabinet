-1-NEMPIrOYMENT.        (1) The Conference had been summoned at short notice,with reference to Cabinet 55 (SO), Conclusion-Jp^Jfor. ageneral discussion on the subject of unemployment,, withspecial reference to the attitude to be taken up by Minis-&apos;ters in the&quot; forthcoming Debate in Parliament,It was generally agreed that the question should be reviewed from the widest point of view:, including, apartfrom the ad hoc relief measures, every provision that hasbeen made for dealing with the problem of ex-Service men .as shown in a Memorandum prepared by the Chancellor of theExchequer, which was circulated to the meeting (See Appendix)a.p., Gratuities, Out rf-Vfork^ Donation, Resettlement Grants,the Industrial Training of Disabled Men, Interrupted Appren--  tieeships, Land Settlement,  Overseas Settlement, EducationalTraining.It was agreed -That the Minister of Labour should confer with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the   -&apos;Minister of Health, the Minister of Trans-port and other Ministers, in regard to theaspects of his review of the.problem ofUnemployment more especially concerningthem, and that those Ministers should hold themselves in readiness to take part in the Debate.
OUSIKGilMANCE,HE BUILDING(GRADE.(2) The attention of the Conference was drawn to a Memc-randum circulated by the Minister of Health to the Committeeon Unemployment  (Paper CVU.-47)  in which it was stated thatif the proposals for building houses by ex-Service men wereto proceed expeditiously it was estimated that a further 4,500,000 of capital would be required for the constructionbt 10,000 houses in London, and a similar provision in theProvinc es.It was stated that the additional expenditure did notarise eut if the extra cost of.employing unskilled labour,estimated by the Ministry of Health at  350 per house, but was due to the acceleration of the Housing Programme.    Thebuilding of a larger number of houses in the current year than had been originally contemplated would necessitateadditional borrowing by the Local&quot;Authorities,(3) The attention of the Conference was called to thedanger of making too strong an attack up^n the Building TradeIt was suggested that while the facts should be stated inthe House of Commons,, that nothing had yet emerged fromnegotiations with the building industry for the admission of ex-Service men, which had been carried on since July, 1919,and that they had refused to admit disabled men who had been trained by the Ministry of Labour, Ministers should be careful in their speeches to avoid a deliberate attack atthis juncture, in order that the policy of the Governmentin relation to the coal strike might not be interpreted as aerenftral attack upon Trade Unionism.    It was felt that thefacts in themselves were sufficiently convincing to.thepublic, who might be left to draw own conclusions.PXLECAL (4) The Conference had under consideration a MemorandumPRILLINGIN SCOTLAND,    by the Secretary for Scotland (Paper 0,P.-1970) on illegaldrilling in Scotland,  covering a Memorandum by the lord advocate, in which it was stated that ex-Service men, some .few thousands in number, were being enrolled in Sinn Pein
oxiganls-a^tions In Scotland for the piirpoetr^rf*--dxllling,particularly-in and around..Xanarh^hire.   It was also be-relieved that the Orangemen in Lanarkshire, who numbered somethousands, were also drilling.    The drillings had been going on for some months, but no- active steps had been taken toprevent or prohibit them.   The instructions of the cabinet were requested as to whether the offenders should be prose-cuted, and, if so, whether proceedings should be taken underthe Defence of the Realm: Act or under an Act 60 George iii and 1 George IV, Gap. 1, which declared that meetings fortraining in the use of arms or military exercises withoutthe authority of the Sovereign, the Lord lieutenant or twoJustices of the Peace, were punishable on conviction bypenal servitude for the instructor and fine and imprisonmentup to two years for those attending the meeting.The attention of the Conference wa3 called to thefact that the Police Forces in Scotland might not be adequate to deal with the situation which would arise if arrests weremade. . &apos; tf W&quot;&apos;It was generally felt that the drilling referred towas a complete defiance of the law., and was particularlydangerous at a time of industrial unrest, and must be stopped.It had been allowed In Ireland, with the result that it had increased to such an extent that it could not be controlled,and I-? now allowed in England and Scotland could only leadto disaster.The suggestion was made that a noDinal penalty shouldbe asked for in the first proceedings, by way of warning.The Conference agreed. --(a) That the Home Secretary In England, andthe Secretary for Scotland, should beauthorised to arrange for the insfitu-tion of prosecutions under the Act60 George III and 1 George IV, Gap. 1,for illegal drilling:(b)That the Home Secretary aad the Secre-tary for Scotland should arrange withthe Secretary of State for War for theprovision of such troops as would benecessary to guard against resistance in the case of arrests.
I^EMMENT  - (5) With reference to Cabinet 54 (20), Conclusion S,l)DSTRIK?TaRT        Conference had under consideration a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (Paper C.P.-1977) on government employees and the Right to Strike, fro.-a which it appeared that the meeting of the Shipbuilding Trades Joint council had received with extreme disfavour the Cabinet decisionabove referred to on Strikes in the Civil Service, had stated their disbelief that it was anything - more than a treasury decree, and had demanded the names of the Ministersv/the subscribed to the decision.    The Chancellor of theExchequer proposed to instruct the Government representa-Ives on the Joint Council to say that the matter-had beenconsidered by the Cabinet in the first place, who nowadhered to their decision, and that they might add,if they felt it desirable, that a Cabinet decision is a decisionof the whole Cabinet, for which all its members bear an equal responsibility.    Finally, rather than allow thedestruction of Whitleylsm at this stage, or the resort todrastic action, they should invite the Staff side of theJoint Council to seek an interview with the Prime Ministerand other members of the Cabinet.It was stated that such a meeting could not takeplace until after the Coal Strike was settled.The Conference agreed  To approve the proposals of the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer.I v.&apos;-:y ------ ..;&apos;-;&quot;&quot;-rI2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,I October 21,  1920.-&quot;-4-1 i A
