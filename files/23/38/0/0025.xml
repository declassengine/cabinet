Conference had before them a Memorandum by the Minis tea  of food regarding Ancillary Pood Services (Paper C..P...2287).maintenancelintonancc In connection with the question pf the for^Mcot- of an organisation to carry on,food services during a strike,tri kc s *which was- referred to in the Memorandum by the Minister ,of food .(Paper CP, 2237), the Conference also had before thema Memorandum by the Chairman of the- Supply and transport committee (Paper CP,&apos;2432 ), showing the running costs.ofthe Supply and Transport organisation during normal times,and asking that authority should be given for an additional expenditure of  5,000 per annum in order to render the nucleus Wireless Scheme complete,.It was explained to the Conf er&amp;Koe that as regardsthe food organisation the question was not one of dealingwith Government stocks of foodstuffs, but Involved the nain-tenance of a. &quot;General Staff&quot; at headquarters, who wouldprepare end keep up to date plans for action-1 during anemergency, and would put those plans Into operation, whenthe time come,    It was estlmatod that the nucleus FoodOrganisation necessary for this purpose would cost about 85,000 per annum,&apos;     The organ!sation consisted of thelocal officers of the&apos; Ministry of Food, i,e, the DivisionalCommissioners each of whom head under him three -PrincipalOfficers,    There was also the headquarters staff, which wasthe ordinary staff of the Ministry of Food who did the workconnected with the Strike Organisation. In addition to ordinary executive&apos; work.     The salaries pf the Headquarters .Staff were not included in the figure of  85,000, but this figure Included a&apos; sunn of  38,000 for enforcement,.   Whenthe work pf enforcement disappears the salaries of the headquarters staff will be Included In the figure  85,000,--- &apos; ,-;P &apos;:It was pointed out that&apos; several questions were Involved;firstly^ should the Government, maintain-,an - organisation for meeting strikes?    Secondly, if such an .Organisation were
maintained, what should its nature be? Thirdly, if the organisation involved work at present performed by officials of the Ministry of Food, to whom should those officials and the organisation be transferred when the Ministry of Food cake to an end?

As regards the first question there was general agreement that the greatest danger in front of any Government in  the next two years would be the danger of so? a great strike. It was vital, therefore, that the Government should maintain some organisation for getting such a crisis. Fears were expressed that the present organisation was  not adequate, and that it would be dangerous for instance to proceed with the disposal of Government stores which had been retained for the purpose of ? strikes. It was explained, however, that while the organisation could not be described as perfect, ti was a very valuable one and was as efficient as circumstances

and political considerations would allow. Moreover, the Emergency Powers Act save drastic powers to the Government, which would enable them, for instance, to commandeer commercial vehicles, of which there were now plenty in the country. It was for this reason that the Supply and Transport Committee had decided that the motor ? retained from disposal could be very largely dispensed with.

As regards the second question, the opinion was expressed that further information should be given as to the exact functions which both the headquarters staff and the officers in the Province of the Ministry of Food would perform in the event of their retention as part of an organisation to maintain the food-supply ? the country a simply during strikes. Fuller information on this point would, it was thought, enable the Cabinet to decide to which Department the Emergency Organisation should be assigned when the Ministry of Food ceased to exist.

In this connection the Conference discussed the proposals in the ? by the Chairman of the Supply and

functions, other than strike work, the staff retained could perform in times of industrial peace, and as to which Department they should come under:

(d) That, on receipt of the Memorandum referred to in (b), from the Minister of Food, the Cabinet should be invited to consider to what Department the nucleus Food Organisation should be attached:

(d) That authority should be given to the Communications Sub-Committee of the Supply and Transport Committee for an additional expenditure of £5,000 per annum, to be devoted to the maintenance of twelve wireless Stations additional to those already covered by the Wireless Scheme: the extra sum of £5,000 to be borne on the War Office Vote.

With reference to page 3 of the Memorandum by the Minister of Food (Paper C.P.-2237), the Conference had before then a Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade (Paper C.P.-2393) regarding the Las Palmas Meat Works.

It was explained that at the beginning of the War Government had found itself very largely dependent on the American Meat Trust for meat supplies. As a result, an Agreement had been entered into between the Government and the British and Argentine Meat Company to lease the Las Palmas works for the period of the War and for six months after the signing of a Treaty of Peace with Germany. This Agreement had worked very satisfactory and had ensured supplies to this country, at a saving of £650,000. It had expired at the end of 1919, but since that date the Board of Trade had been in negotiation for its renewal, and, with Treasury sanction, had continued the operation of the Las Palmas works for another year. Renewed discussions had been held with the British and Argentine Meat Company, with a view to a more permanent Agreement, and the Company had offered a lease of ten years, terminable by either party at the end of five years on six months notice. The offer had been accepted, subject to converting sanction, and a new Agreement had been drawn up. The period of this Agreement ran from January 1, 1920, so that one ? of the nominal five years had now  
expired.    Irmvrew^f-^ie- attitude o f--thekJl&amp;bdjaet towards this Agreement at their: last discussion,, the Board of Trade-had again &quot;been, in communication with the Company, and it was now&apos; suggested: &quot;that. .thn&apos;--Agreement should be limited to threeyears, i,.e....,- .a further two -years- from. January- 1,, 1921.&apos;The-opinion was- expressed that a- continuation of theAgreement&apos;&apos; would&apos; be &apos; only - fair to . the Company,, which had per-formsd important, services&apos;to this country during the War,and that it would also be most useful to the British Govern-ment, since it would afford them an &quot;observation post&quot; in &quot;thecentre of the operations of the American Meat Trust.    Both-.,,the Committee on Imperial Meat Resources, appointed...in-1917,and an Interdepartmental Committee.&quot;appointed in 1919, had -reported in favour of some form of help to the British MeatCompanies operating in the Argentine.. . Without such help itwas almost certain that the American Meat Trust would eliiain-ate&quot; the British. Companies, who would, however, probably bep&amp;ble to faee-.-competition alone in a year - or two, providedtfley had the suooort of the British- Government at the present7-time.    The American-Meat Trust, it was expected, would not attempt to force the British Meat&apos;.Companies to close downXf they knew that the British Government were supportingthose Companies.    It was not anticipated that any loss would$ebrue to the Brit.ish.Government from the Agreement, and thebpirri-on was expressed that tho early removal of all control on the price of meat -might&apos;.result&apos; in higher prices and a consequent profit.    Removal of control.was inevitable, owingto the opposition of agriculturists in,the United Kingdom&apos; -arid-   the Dominions and foreign Countries.This, wouldresult, in agitation against the anticipated rise in prices,&quot;and it would be useful for the Government. to bs able topoint^to - the Das: Palmas Agreement as- a definite step taken with,- a view to keeping prices- down.; -It was explained&apos;. to the Conference that there was.now no. longer any&apos;necessity &quot;for the- introduction of the--g-?*- ; ......

Suchlicensing would not involve legislation.As regards registration of retailers of milk,... it was-thought that the. continuance of such registration was desiable until the Ministry of Health were able.to obtain thenecessary statutory powers..   The retailers of meat weredesirpus of maintaining a system of- registration for-them-.-,selves,The Conference agreed  -&apos;    That the question of maintaining a system,of licensing slaughterhouses and of regis-tsring retailers of meat and milk,  togetherwith any other cognate-questions, should beleft to be settled by .a Conference of represent-sentativss of  -The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries,The Ministry of Health,The Scottish Office,The Ministry of Food,and any other Departments which might beconcern-; dpansference&apos;the Stafff the Food,ministry topother De-artment.The Conference wore- invited to&apos; decide which Depart-ment should be responsible for the Staff of the Ministry ofFood after the closing, down of that Department, and theopinion -as express-d that, the Board of Trade was the i9iostappropriate Department.    It was stated that the work ofthe&apos;Ministry of Food could be closed down entirely - withinthe year.
The Conference agreed  &quot;That the President of the Board of Tradeand the. Minister of- Food-, should confer andreport to the. Cabinet as to whether it^oulfl b&quot; practicable for the Staff of the-Ministry .o&quot;F&quot; Food to be transferred- to- th&amp;tB0ard of Trade, in order that thatBepartrn nt -right become responsible for-liquidating the Ministry, of Food.
