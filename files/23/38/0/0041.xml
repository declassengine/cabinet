The risk of sabotage, before the strikersleft the works, though not very probable, could not be eliminated.    The Conference were informed, however, thatthere were Naval ratings available for all theLondon Power-stations.:HE NAVAL (2) The Conference were informed that one of the NavalBATTALIONS.battalions had provided itself with ratings capable of driving its own locomotives.HE DEFENCE        &apos; (3) The Conference were informed that 40,000 men hadORCE.been-reported officially as attested in the Defence Force.The full number was undoubtedly greatly in excess ofthis.* -        .

The Recruiting Officers had no meansof distinguishing Sinn Feiners or Communists, but a careful watch was being kept, and reports of suspectedpersons were already being received from men in the ranks.The Conference agreed  (a) That it was inadvisable at present to enlist strikers:(b) That Commanding Officers should be in-structed to keep in touch with the chief constables, with a view to close scrutiny of the names of enlisted men.attitude ofployers.IOPAGANDA.(5) The Conference were informed that employers werenot giving facilities for enlistment by their employes.It appeared that they were not yet alive to the gravity oftbo situation.(6) The Conference discussed at some length the ques-tions of propaganda and publicity.    Instances were given ofthe amazing ignorance of the facts of the situation and ofthe Government*s offers, even among persons such as Membersof Parliament, who ought to be well informed.   The need for very extensive propaganda and publicity was stronglyemphasized.Sir Philip Lloyd-Greame reported that some 1,700&apos;briefs&quot;, compiled by very&apos;competent writers in daily touch-2-
with Departmental representatives and working through the   ^ ^ordinary press channels, were being sent daily to the press in all parts of the country., including the evening papers.A daily telegram was being sent to many districts.Comment was made on the inadequacy of the publicityarrangwnte       the rvine-owners,The Conference agreed  (a) That Sir Philip Lloyd-Grearns should tonightcontinue the efforts already made in thePress to emphasize the salient points inthe Government1 s proposals, -and the grounds for the miners&apos; refusal:(b) That, with a view to the preparation of aposter stating the issue in clear and simple language und-r such headings as&quot;WHAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS OFFERED&quot;,&quot;WHAT TH^ MINE-OWNERS HAVE OFFERED&quot;,&quot;WHY THE NEGOTIATIONS BROKE DOWN?etc.,the Prime Minister, accompanied by theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Ministerof Labour., the Secretary of State for. theColonies and Sir Philip Lloyd-Grsame,should, in the first instance, meet Mr EvanWilliams, Sir Adam Nirmo,        Mr PinlayGibson,  and Mr Lee.ISIBLH (7) With reference to Conclusion 12 of the Conference ofISPAPER15. Ministers held on April 7th, at 12-15 p.m., the conference were informed that, up to the present, there was no information to indicate a strike in the newspaper offices.dissented fromThe view was not that if all the newspapers/except the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; were stopped by the Trade Unionsit would almost certainly be/ftecessary to suppress the &quot;daily herald&apos;&quot;..LY TO THE (8) The Conference discussed at sore length the naturem PROMJ.E. THOMAS of the reply to be sent by the Prime Minister to the letterMl- ROBERTMAMS-.        ^rorr- the National Union of Railwaymen and the national transport Workers&apos; Federation, notifying their intention to strike on Friday next at 1C p.m., and agreed -(a) That th? Prime Minister should send thefollowing reply* 13th April, 1921.Dear Mr Thomas and &quot;.. r Williams,I am in receipt of your letter.   Thedecision you report is a grave, one,&apos; You
threaten on Friday night to dislocatethe whole of the Transport services ofthis country so essential to the life of the Nation.I should like to know the grounds on which you have determined to inflictsuch a serious blow on your fellow-country men.Yours faithfully,(Sd.) Do LLOYD GEORGE&quot;.(b) That the above letter should be publishedforthwith.(9) The Conference considered a proposal of the Secre-tn-ry o-p state ^or War, which they were informed was concurred in by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and the adjutant-General, to attach, to the Staffs of certain Commandsdiscreet civilians, such as Members of Parliament, to act asLiaison Officers between the military and the civil      author-ities.   These persons would be under the orders of theGeneral Offleets Commanding, on the analogy of correspondingappointments made during the ftar in connection with theadministration of the Defence of the Realm Act.    The maindifference between the present proposal and th&quot; war arrange-ment was that the new Liaison Officers would not wear uniform and would not be under military law, as they had been duringthe *ar.This question was reserved for futureconsideration.
