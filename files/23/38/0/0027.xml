With-jref erenow held.January- -24th, 1921, the .Conference had/ before them the copy, of&apos;a letter, from the Chairman of the -unemployment grants Committee to the Prime -Minister(C..P.2483) inwhich he asked -(a) That the&quot; powers of the-&apos;Committee to deal.    - . with, roads whi ch were not&apos;within the- Ministryof Transport&apos; s Scheme &apos;fo:r - construction and-maintenance grants&apos;.? should hot be limited to-cases where the expenditure on labour was not; less than 50  of the total expenditure; and* *-(b). that advances toT&amp;ards. the cost-of labour in-schemes put&apos; forward by /the Local Authorities.,: -should;-.. no- longer be limited to&apos; 30;:c: but/should be extended to 60,Vat once,v;Ith regard to; (A) Lord St.. Davids stated that he wasInformsd by the Ministry of Transport that except incases of new roads or road work In which there was a-great deal of excavation to be done, the labour cost would seldom approximate to, 50/6 of the work, and there-fore the extension of the powers of the Committee whichwas recently granted would, only&apos;increase to a very limited extent the Committee8e capacity for promoting employment.With regard to (b) the position on the 20thJanuary was that the total grants promised, to cover workup to 30th.Aprils -192.1, only amounted to  72/760 and Itwas probable that It would be difficult to make largegrants quickly out of the  3,000,000 authorised by theCabinet unless -nearly all the money required by the LocalAuthorities ^as provided for them^     To all intents and purposes the present scheme of-grants had broken down.The Conference was reminded by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer of the position,at the time when theCabinet made the grant of  3,000,000.     The Cabinetthen, was anxious.to husband-- its resources $ but how - as there appeared little, danger of the  3,000,666 limit beingexceeded, there could, be-little objection- to falling in with the suggestion. made, by Lord St, Davids,The/
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, however, attached greatimportance to obtaining as large a local contribution aspossible,,      Unemployment had always been regarded as a localproblem -. the central Government confining itself to supplementinglocal effort.     He was anxious that local bodies should notbe encouraged to abandon this responsibility.Lord St. Davids stated &quot;that in connection with his request for power to grant 6Cpo of the Wages Bill of additional mentaken for work, there was one minor point which he would liketo raise.     At present the Committee could only make grants to assist Local Authorities In carrying out schemes, a phrasewhich rendered It doubtful whether the Committee could make agrant to a Local Authority for the purpose of enabling itto assist a scheme to be carried out, e,;g-;. by a DistressCommittee or by Voluntary Agency.     He suggested the committee might be empowered to make grants in such cases providedthat the Local Authorities definitely recommended thescheme and made themselves responsible for the&apos;Committee&apos;sconditions and provided also that no grant was made in respectof any scheme of which the proceeds (if any) would go to private persons or commercial companies.The Conference agreed,-(a) that the power of the Unemployment Grants Committee, to deal with roads which were not within the Ministryof Transport&apos;s scheme for construction or maintenancegrants, should not be limited to cases where theexpenditure on Labour was not less than b0% of thetotal expenditure.(to) that grants towards the cost of labour In schemesput forward by the Local Authorities should beextended from 50/5 to 60/&amp;,fo) that the powers of the Committee to make grants toLocal Authorities should be extended to include a-   grant to a Local Authority to enable it to assista Distress Committee or &quot;Voluntary Agency In carryingout a scheme provided that the scheme was recommendeddefinitely by the Local Authority, and that thelatter made itself responsible, that the conditions laid down by the Unemployment Grants Committee were observed. .
rVTCE MEET With reference to Cabinet S3 (So),  Conclusion .6,.0TJ3IFGTIONS. the conference&apos; had before them a. Memorandum by thelusion 2).Minister of Labour (CP.2468)  in which he raised thequestion of the redemption of the Government under--taking that 5o, OOO ex-service men should be employedon Housing Operations.-  -    -   ; :   &apos;- &apos;-.;f&apos; .      ,    -The Minister,.-.of Labour informed the ConferenceF &apos;that.-the answer of the. building trade -operatives to theGovernment request -for their assistance- in. the matter,would not be received until after 3rd February,    but that so far as present indications went they were likely torefuse their co-operation-.    The Minister of Labour therefore suggested inter alia.the following measures:-(a) That as there /were enough sites now ready for building operations to take 50,000ex-service.men,  the Local Authoritiesshould be asked if they would take onex-service men for these sites.(b) That as the City of London was preparedto proceed with ex-service  men on the site now in its possession it should beinvited to make the-preliminary prepara-tions for employing ex-service men onthis 3ite.The Minister of Labour held the view, that if (b)above was set in operation other Local Authorities would. &apos; be compelled by public opinion to follow suit. Afterthe 3rd February it would be necessary to get the ex-service men together, and train them if the promise ofthe Government was to be redeemed.The opinion was expressed that action,  such as hadbeen indicated, by. the City of London would be followedby other Looal. Authorities - though the. /- 3-
weakness cf the su/?ge&amp;tirOn--of. the Minister of Labourthewas that it did not &quot;bring in/employers,   employers-; woulc.be.shy of falling in with the suggestion on account ofthe fear that, if they undertook such housing work their employees- would strike on their other hui Iding contracts.It was .suggested, that &quot;between now and. the 3rd February-e g^f?v&apos; &apos;the gilding.Employers Federation should be consulted as local Authorities, would be, quite helpless without their assistance.-   The Ministry of-Health estimated that 98$of the housing schemes of Local Authorities were in factbeing-, executed by private contractors&apos;.It was also stated that a number of local authorities would like to.take the line suggested by the Minister of* .-. .&apos;. : &quot;&apos; : ;-&apos;.-.-.&apos;. &quot;&apos; - *Labour, if they dared.The.Conference generally thought that before coming-to a decision on the question raised by the Minister ofLabour, it was necessary to be further informed as to how far the Government was-likely to succeed in itsendeavour to employ -50,000 ex-service men on buildingoperations,- without the assistance of the Building TradeOperatives.     -Th e C on ferenc e agre ed:-(1) To appoint the following Committee -Secretary for Scotland (chairman)Minister of Labour.Mini ster -of-.
