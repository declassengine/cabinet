jjn SETTLE- With reference to Cabinet 78 (20), Conclusion 5,OF EX-MEN       the Prime Minister explained that he wished to see thei SCOTLAND,officials concerned with the administration of Land Settle-ment in Scotland, for the purpose of exploring thepossibility of hastening the fulfilment of the pledgesthat had been given to men who had volunteered in the Yfarthat they would be settled on the land on their return.It was pointed out that even if the proposals inthe Land Settlement Committeefs Report were adopted, only ,000 out of a waiting list of 5,000 ex-Service applicantswould be given land, and it was Impossible to ask theremainder to wait indefinitely.&apos;The first proposal discussed was a grant of land on&quot;prairie&quot; t*rms, with a small money grant.     It was ex-plained that this had already been attempted, but the response was practically nil, the men had nowhere to live,and the minimum expenditure possible.was  500 for awooden hous** and steading with a further grant of  500for building a proper house, the total cost Includingfencing, water and equipment being  1,300 on a holding of40 to 50 acres, the sias of the average holding.     Incertain districts 10 acres were regarded as feasible forintensive cultivation, but there was nothing between10 and 40 acres.     On the other hand, in England and wales the average slzd was 13 acres, holdings varying from 2 or3 acres to 30 acres, or even.50-acres.     With  1,300 forbuildings and equipment, and  650 for land, the averagecapital cost for each holding was  2,000 and the return,In the form of rentA would be only 2 per cent, while theGovernment rould not borrow at less than &amp;i per cent,with an additional i- per cent for sinking-fund.v     The Prime Minister was of opinion that such asystem was bad and taneeonomlc. - It was so slow that Itcould not have.any appreciable effect en the characterof the population, it involved a dead loss to thecomnaunlty^. and was of a. very speculative nature.
Re- suf,y;ested that the /Belgian system of holdings of from to 5 acres,, v/worked by men who were engagedin other occupations, some of them working in the towns, wouldbe quicker and more . satisfactory.      It wes no use reducing expenditure on the present system;    they must devise someother system involving more modest proposals and settling a -larger number of people, in order to get value for their money..The Chancellor cf the Exchequer pointed out that theGovernment, would have great difficulty in facing: a comparison between tho expenditure on land settlement in England and scotland, if Scotland, already having had nearly: the wholeof its proportionate share according to-population, were to.take a   largely increased share, and   if at the same time theexpenditure per holding in Scotland were so much higher.The Secretary for Scotland stated that tho pledges given   were not territorial but absolute, and that anfti&apos;.-itjpcnt   baaed on   tho   usual ^ proportion did not apply.WHe stated   that the histcry of land settlement in Scotland was.quite different,   from that in England the holding of50 acres or thereby dating back   as far as   1886..     It would&apos;bo extremely difficult to break off   a systein to which thepeople had become   accustomed.     Already the position wasmenacing, and there had been frequent end extensive raids..Reference was. also made to the Danish system,, which hadbeen very   successful.     It was contended that the:-naturalconditions in Denmark were analogous to those in Scotland,and that an. effort should,   be   made, to   concentrate settlement in Scotland In the neighbourhood of the towns,., where, owingto tho proximity of r. market,, intensive cultivation waspossible..Sir-Robert Grolg stated  that the only wry in which itwould&apos; be possible   to impose a system of holdings of smallsizd .woul&amp; be to offer holdings of 10 acres on condition that the   applicant?s name would be removed from the list,if the offer were not accepted..
It - waa agreod:-That tho Secretary for Scotland should confer with the officials of the scottish office and endeavour-to devise a systembetter adapted, on the one hand, to theneed for acceleration, and, on the other,to the difficulty of Incurring large capital expenditure, in present financial conditions, and that the matter should befurther discussed with the Prime minister on tho following Tuesday, January 4th, 1921,2, Whitehall Gardens, S,W4th January, 1921,
