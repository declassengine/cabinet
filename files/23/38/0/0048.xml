TBS PRIME MINISTER explained that the latestdifficulty *vas as fellows.     The &quot;Arrangement   for thedischarge of Germany&apos;s liability under the Treaty ofVersailles&quot;drawn up at the present Conference in Londonpossibleprovided a /alternative to the schedule of payment to bodrawn up by tho Reparation Commission under Article 233of the Treaty.     This new &quot;Arrangement&quot; however would bemore favourable to the Germans than the schedule which theReparation Commission was likely to forward.     M. Briandbad explained that from a political point of view, in thepresent state of French politics It would be extremelydifficult for him to defend the adhesion on the part ofwhich appearedthe French Government to a scheme/less favourable to theAllies than that prepared by the Reparation Commission.The difficulty could be surmounted If it were possiblefor the Reparation Commission to adopt the London schemewhether as an alternative to the Reparation Commission^scheme or otherwise.After reading the text of Clause 22 of Annex 2,Part 8 of the Treaty, he pointed out that in effect thoReparation Commission would be acting in conjunction withthe Governments concerned.SIR JOHN BRADBURY pointed out that it would benecessary for the Allied Governments to amend Annex 2 be-fore the Reparation Commission could formulate proposalsnot at present covered by the Treaty.     Por this purpose it would be necessary that the Serbian Government shouldbe represented at the Conference since that Government hada representative on the Reparation Commission.     Moreover,some little time must elapse before the necessaryformalities....
-formalities, such as the execution of an amending protocol,could he carried out.He agreed that the words of Article 233, relative to the Commission&apos;s powers of prescribing the time and mannerfor securing and discharging the entire obligation within aperiod of 30 years from the 1st May, 1931 were very wide, andhe himself had held that any outstanding bonds unpaid&quot;on theexpiration of the 30 year period would continue to run onthereafter.     His colleagues on the Comisslon, however, tookan opposite view and held that under the Treaty the entiredebt must be extinguished within, the 30 year period.Some discussion followed as to the recent refusal ofthe Germans to appear before the Reparation Commission.Sir John Bradbury explained that the Germans had refused tocome and discuss the Commission1s original schedule until theresult of the Conference of London was known.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that such refusal justifiedserious measures, and he suggested that if the Germans declined to appear before the Reparation Commission before May 12th., theCommission might then proceed to treat Germany as in default.SIR JOHN BRADBURY remarked that he was doubtfulwhether he would be justified in taking up this attitude.     he agreed that apart from the question of the 30 year period, theother points were Annex 2 points.:    He also.agreed with the PrimeMinister and Sir Robert Home that the &quot;Arrangement&quot; should goto Germany as a whole and that no attempt&apos;      to split it up should be made.     In any case it would have to bo made perfectly clear that the question of guarantees was for the Governments.-&apos;As regards communication to the Germans, he was strongly of opinion that this should be done by the Conferenceand not by the Reparation Conoission.THE PRIME MINISTER
THE&apos;PRIM3-MIITI5T3Pr pointed out tnat it was very nec-essary to try and help France in the matter.     M. Briand had stated that he had foregone substantial... suns by agreeing to the&quot;Arrangement&quot;.     While this was not the case, French publicopinion could not bo convinced and it was desirable to do every-thing to meet the French Government.SIS JOHN BRADBURY thought that it might be possible forthe Reparation Commission to draw up a schedule of paymentsbased on the figures specified in the &quot;Arrangement&quot;, and put Intothe 30 year period all amounts which under the &quot;Arrangement&quot;would fall outside the 30 year period.SIR ROBERT HORNS thought that it would be better ifthe Reparation Commission could see its way to take the &quot;Arrange-ment&quot; as a whole,SIR JOHN BRADBURY said that he., personally, could notbe a party to the adoption of the &quot;Arrangement&quot; by the ReparationCommission, and some of his colleagues held stronger views on thepoint than he did.     He would have no objection to submitting a schedule to the Germans, and at the same time informing thea thatthe Allied Governments had agreed the &quot;Arrangement&quot; which theReparation Commission would be prepared to endorse:if Germanyaccepted it.     Another possible alternative, though one involvingsome delay, would be for the Reparation Commission to postponesending their schedule to the Germans- and to Invite the ebesrv-ations of the latter on the &quot;Arrangement&quot;, the Allies in themeantime sending Germany their ultimatum.The Meeting felt that this latter alternative Wasimpraoticablo.LORD D* ABERNON suggested that it might be desirableto have a document drawn up bringing the provisions of the&quot;Arrangement&quot; within a 30 year period.&apos;SIR JOHN BRADBURY said, in reply to a questioa^put bythe Prime Minister who asked how It would be possible to prepare a schedule of payments with the proposed index number, that\In
his view the Reparation Commission schedule need not necessarilyprovide for payments on an arithmetical basis.     Ho added th&amp;tM. Duhois, the Chairman of the Commission, would voice theCommission&apos;s views at the Meeting of the Inter-allied conference this afternoon.(The proceedings then terminated!., Whitehall Gardens, S.W*4th May, 1921.
