With reference to Qahi.net 37 (20), Appendix II (3),FEE GOVERMgSWTIt IRELAND^filLL.the Conference discussed the desirability of making certain-       wcendmenta in the Government of Ireland Bill as regardsfinance.    The suggestion was that both the Northern and southern Parliaments should receive complete financialautonomy; and that the contribution to Imperial services in its p-esent form should be dropped, and, instead, that each portion of Ireland should assuBie liability for a defi-nite portion of the National Debt and should be left tocontribute voluntarily to all other Imperial expendititrewhatever sum its Parliament might think fit.In support! of this proposal it was stated that therewas a great advantage in pursuing this course and of putting forward a financial scheme which would be accepted by thetwo Irish. Parliaments.   The Bill as it stood at presefcjpyjKw. .though not ungenerous,  could be made more liberal as ffe&amp;^rdsfinance.    A further defect of the present Bill was thss-tW^-there was too much British intervention in Irish affairs./&apos;and the collection by English officials of Customs, Exciseand Income Tex would act as an irritant.    It was contended that the Government should have the courage of its convic-tions, and say that this new solution was put forward inthe belief that it would settle the question, that nofurther concession could possibly be made, and that the giving of complete financial autonomy to both Parliamentswas the Government&apos;s limit in the way of concession.further, this plan would have th?- support of, and would strengthen, all moderate opinion in Ireland.   An additionalargument put forward in support cf the new scheme was thatthe Government was in need of all the strength and backingit could obtain from public opinion in breaking up the murder gang, and doubt was expressed whether such support-would be forthcoming if it was considered that the Governmenthad not gone far enough in the way of financial concession.
THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought it would be a mistake at- this stage to make any great concessions, especi-ally when the prospects of getting anything in-return were so small.    Nothing would be left with which to negotiate ifthe Irish adopted a conciliatory attitude.    The giving of customs, Excise and Income Tax meant a great deal, and ifthis were done Ireland could not remain an Integral part ofthe United Fingdom.    The scheme put forward was not compatible with her so remaining.    She could either support us or not,as she chose.    The test to apply was whether you could give to other parts of the United Kingdom,that which you were giving to Ireland, and it was obvious that It would be impos-sible to do so.    The retention of Customs was always regardedas a sign of unity *    Take the cases where there were otherFederal systems       Germany and the United States of America.Bavaria was independent, had a separate King and a separatearmy;    but they had not got Customs.    It was, in fact, thefirst thing they gave up as a symbol of unity to the german empire.    The United States did not give Customs and Excise toits Federal States,    At one time the States had had thelevying of Income Tax, and one of the greatest politicalstruggles in the United States had been with the object ofobtaining Federal control of Income Tax, which had been foundabsolutely essential in order to raise money for defence.We, who had control of Income Tax, were now talking of givingit up.    That would be to let Ireland off financially.    Thatwas not the Home Rule on which he had been brought up.  &quot;IfCustoms had to be conceded in order to obtain peace, it mightbe considered:   but he would only consider it if it wasimpossible to get other terms.    Sinn Fein would have to come forward and bargain.    But the Government had already saidthat they were prepared to come to an agreement.    By giving up Customs, Excise and Income- Tax we should get nothing inreturn from. Sinn Fein.    By giving up these three things we
delivered the key of the whole position to Sinn Fein;    theywould collect the taxes and would re-fv.se to pay their contri-bution to the Imperial exchequer.   What should we do then?Try and get Customs,  &quot;-&quot;xoise and Income Tax back again?    once the machinery for collecting these taxes had been handed overit would be impossible to get it back.Continuing,  ?H* FRILSE MINISTER said that he was all forjustice for Ireland, but at the same time it. must be remem-bered that justice was due to England, Scotland and Wales,who had made greater sacrifices in the war than Ireland-.This country would have to bear the extra burden of thefinancial&apos; concessions proposed, and there would be in Irelandcheap whiskey, cheap tobacco   everything cheap;    and herepeople would be staggering under their burdens.    Such a stateof affairs would be intolerable and unjustifiable.    Anotherreason was that Sinn Fein would not accept such concessions,for it     s abundantly clear that they meant to have complete independence, and would not take anything less.    We had got agreat inheritance, and in a moment of despair must not barterit away in order to got &quot;Peace in our time, 0 Lord&quot;!    Ke waslooking forward to using Customs, Excise and Income Tax as a means of reducing Ireland.    Ulster meant to work this Bill.As for the South, she would use it and the proposed conces-sions to extort some-thing further.    If we retained thesetaxes the Sinn feiners were at our mercy.    He had asked SirLaming Worthington Evans some time ago to work out how muchof the revenue of Ireland would remain in our hands if weheld only the ports, and he had worked it out at something like thfee-quarters.    He himself was in favour of holdingthe ports until a guarantee of some kind was forthcoming.To the counties in the South which declared a Republic hewould say:    &quot;You must pay your Old Age Pensions, Insurances,etc., etc.&quot;    Such a course was not without precedent.    the roman Empire had constantly to do. this kind of thing in sicily.    Tf we gave up Customs, Excise and Income Tax without
2/ 3getting anything in. return, it would be the worst piece ofbusiness which this Government had f-ver done, and he couldnot face the position.    Such taxes ought to be Imperial taxes,and it was unsound in principle to part with these things.He was still a Gladstonian Home Ruler, and wished to keepIreland as an integral part of the United Kingdom, and thatwas -why he hoped that the present Bill would be proceeded with,    ^he Pill was a good and generous one, and under itit&apos;would be possible to keep the United Kingdom, vmich was asmall country, together in aoire sort of unity and enable itto face the future.    He would.stand by the Bill until some-one with real authority in Ireland appeared with whoa it waspossible to negotiate.THP. P&apos;IMF MtJJISTSP. added that, he would like the Parlia-mentary Draughtsman to consider to what extent under the Billit was possible for the Imperial Government to retain controlof certain parts of Southern Ireland, whilst leaving the SinnFein Parliament to govern the rest, and also to what extent it was possible to. govern the retained areas as we chose.The Conference agreed --That no change of principle should be madein the Financial Clauses of the Governmentof Ireland Bill.S, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,October IS, 193C.
