(1) With reference to Cabinet 59 (20), Appendix. Y (3),the Conference had before them, two documents on the subjectOf Armehi&amp;-:-(i) A telegram from 11, Eymans.   the Presidentof the Council of the League of ilations,ashing whether the British Governmentwould, be disposed,  either alone or con-jointly with other nations,  te -undertakeon behalf of the League of Nations the humanitarian mission of stopping hostilities-ties between. Armenia and the Legalists(Paper C.P.-2I9&amp;):(ii)  A telegram from Mr Fish?r5  from Geneva,stating that M, Viviani and Lord robert cecil ffs;&apos;g attempting to rush Armenia intothe League of Nations,  that he and mr balfour doubt-d the advisability of this;&apos;but that, when&apos;the question was consideredby the Assembly,  the admission of Armeniamight be carried by nations which wouSdnot raj.s v- a finger to assist the cause ofArmenia.In regard to  (i)  the Conference were informed that president Wilson was reported in the Press to have acceptedthe invitation of the Council to mediate between Armeniaand the Herbalists,  on the understanding that there was noquestion of utilising American forces.,    Spain and Brazilwere reported to have made friendly but non-committalreplies.It was pointed out that events were moving rapidly in these regions, and that Armenia, with scant resources,with little -apparent capacity to defend herself and almostcut off from the outside world:,, was ground between theTurkish Nationalists and the Bolshevist Russians, whotp-- Tr.s^l-res appeared to be rapidly drifting into a stateof hostilities.    In these circumstances Armenia wouldprobably make her own terms,  or have terms forced on her.It was generally felt that., in view of our immensepreoccupations elsewhere, it would not he desirable forGreat Britain to volunteer to undertake this intervention.- * jIn regard to the admission of Armenia to the Leagueof Nations,  it was pointed out that admission had been refused to other nations, such as tho Baltic States,which were in many respects Letter qualified than Armenia
Hifor admission-.    The admission of other Tranc-GauoasianStates had &quot;been refused on- the ground that their boundarieswere as yet unsettled.   Yet the Armenian boundaries, pendinPresident Wilson&apos;s decision, were still undefined.    It was further pointed out that the admission of Armenia to theLeague would, under Article 10 of the Covenant, involve&quot; anundertaking to respect and preserve as against external aggression its territorial integrity and existing political independence.    Undertaking obligations that it would be incapable of fulfilling would weaken the League.While the Conference generally agreed with Mr Balfouiand Mr Fisher that it was undesirable for Armenia to be ad-mitted to the League, it was felt, equally strongly, thatfor the British Government to adopt an isolated attitude of opposition, when other nations were unanimously in favour oladmission, would create a very disagreeable position from apolitical point of view.After considerable discussion^ the Conference agreed(a) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should px*epare a telegram, to besent by the Prime Minister to the PresidentOf the Council of the League of Nations,observing that the President of the UnitedStates has expressed his willingness to mediate with a view to ending hostilities,and pointing out that we are not clear asto the extent to which the Armenians mayhave anticipated this action by negotiating with the Turks or theBolsheviks.    In anycase, His Majesty&apos;s Government ishnable toaccept any independent Mission, but will give every moral and diplomatic support to anyefforts made by President Wilson:(b) That the question of the admission of Armeniato the League of Nations should be raised that afternoon at the- Conference with the Frenchand Italian Governments.
halion toPrimeff.sier and&apos;chancellor the Ex-iluer.(2)    The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that-alittle tine ago a letter had been received from certainLancashire Authorities asking that &quot;the Ministry ofHealth and the Prime Minister should receive aDeputation regarding Old. Age Pensions.      Owing tc art-unfortunate mistake in the treasury? the request&apos; hadbeen refused without consultation with the PrimeMinister or himself.      This rejfcly had somewhatirritated those    responsible for aching that theDeputation might be received..      ^he Chancellor of theExchequer added, that he was prepared to receive theDeputation if pressed, but that he proposed if the cabinet agreed., to&apos; refuse their proposal, which wasthat Old Age Pensions should be paid to everyone on reaching the age of &apos;70.Tile Conference concurred in the reply theChancellor of the Exchequer proposed to make,
(5)With reference to Cabinet 63 (20),Conclusion. 1, the Conference had before them thefollowing documents dealing with the queotion of theGovernment&apos;s foreign policy in the Middle Easts -Memorandum by the Secretary of.Statefor War (Paper CcPo-2165).Memorandum by the Secretary cf Statefor Fcreign Affairs   Paper CaP^-2193).Telegram &quot;from Viceroy,. Foreign andPolitical Department,, dated November 23rd,1920,, (Paper C. P. .-2164). &apos;Telegram from Viceroy, dated November 2nd,1920; (Paper C.P.-2209).Memorandum by the Secretary of. State fpvIndia (Paper CP.-2210)-.It was- argued that it was impossible to maintainVur present position except, mi a basis of friendly relations with Turkey^     Owing, to the expense and&quot;ether difficulties.connected with both white and indian tresps&apos;, It could not be contemplated that theywould be maintained at their present strength for a prolonged period.      An opportunity has now arisen, owingto the results of the Greek elections, for us to lightenour burdens in the Middle East by arriving at under^standings with the Turks and making the conditions ofthe Treaty- of Sevres less heavy on them     As a resultof our policy in this part of the world, an unnaturalAlliance had sprung up between the Turks and theBolshevikso though there were now signs of its breaking,and the question arose now as to which side the BritishGovernment should lean..A considerable measure of agreement was expressed&quot;with the view that the possibility of handing backSmyrna to the uncontrolled rule of the Turks by theAllies could not be entertained, though there was somesympathy expressed with the suggestion that it mightbe turned into an autonomous area under the suzerainty ...of the Turks.
It was generally agreed that the question, would haveto he reviewed In the event ef the Greeks failing t* jtiaintsintheir position in thai area.     Thifc led to the point -as tothe desirability of making, s. revise^loa now af the Treaty ofSevred, or of halting&apos; until such time as certain clauses ofthe Treaty were not carried Into effect or for any reasonbroke down.     &apos;A&apos;he advantages of entering into direct negotia-tions with Mustapha     anal were discussed,  and the conference were informed of steps which were being taken at Constant!-&apos;nople, and which met with general approval.      On the otherheuad, strong emphasis was laid on.the fact that the treaty with Turkey had been signed by the Allies, Italy in facthaving ratified-it, and&apos; that the Turks were being pressed todo so.     Within the next two years the Treaty might breakdown at some point owing to the new situation in Greece, andIt&apos; would be &quot;preferable to await -events rather than&apos; to Initiata revision of the Treaty at the.present moment, &apos; Also, toundertake kow&apos;the task of revising the Treaty -would involvea re-opening of a number of difficult questions, which forthe present&apos; at .&amp;ny rate had been adjusted.The trend of the discussion showed general agreementwith the following conclusion .That His Majestyfs Government should con-tinue to press the Turlts to ratify the Treaty&apos;   of Sevres,  and should resist attempts to modify the Treaty directly and at oace&apos;..     In the eventof the subsequent non-fulfilment of certainterms of the Treaty, the opportunity should betaken to reconsider the situation which wouldthen arise, In a light, more favourable to turkey.
Note by the Secretary.-In connection with the above Minute on Greece and. middle eastern Policy., the Secretary of State for War has asked that the accompanying Memorandum,  (see Appendix)  In whichhe records his personal opinion as to the trend of the\ v-,:&apos;:.&apos;&apos;. &apos;f\-:i &apos; - &apos;. i:&apos;n      .^ -discussion on this subject, may be circulated.The Secretary of State for War has also asked that hisformal dissent from the Conclusion as stated in the revisedMinute above, may be recorded,(Into.,)    H/P.A.H.2, Whitehall -Gardens* S.W.I.11th December, 1920.
.    GREBCB AND MIDDLE EASTERN......POLICY.,Note by tho Secretary of State for War regardingConclusion (o) of the Conclusions of a Conferenceof Ministers held on Thursday. 2nd December, 1920.I consider that the account of the discussion on this subject does not fairly represent the opinions expressed?      I stated my own views and those of theGeneral Staff, but I thought that they were in themain in accordance with those of the Lord Privy Seal,the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the secretaries of State for India and the Colonies.     Those views were that to should make a definite change In our policy in the direction of procuring a real peace withthe Moslem world and so relieving ourselves of the disastrous reaction both military and financial towhich our anti-Turk policy has exposed us in the liddieEast and In India*     However, speaking only for myself,I repudiate the suggestion in the third paragraph that&quot;there was unanimous agreement with the view that thepossibility of handing back Smyrna to the Turks by thexAllies could not be entertained&quot;. On the contrary,I em convinced that the restoration of Turkish sovereigntyor suzerainty over the Smyrna Province is an indispensablestep.to the pacification of the Middle East.      It isquite true that like others I hold that effectiveadministrative protection must be secured to the christian population; and I am sure that there are several ways in which this could be afforded withoutdepriving the Turks of their Suzerainty.      The statement in the Report, that &quot;there was srome sympathy expressed with -the suggestion thati^might be turned into an autonomous area&quot; Is not to- my recollection borne outby the factsB      I do not remember anyone suggestingthis solution for Smyrna- though It was mentioned inregard to Thrace *
&quot;With, regard to the Treaty of Sevres-,  I certainlythought the general opinion was that this Instrumentwould have to be modified- but that it might be better to modify it by an amending instrument rather than byabandoning the Treaty.      The discussion on this point was unhappily very much curtailed,.The sentence &quot;It was felt that sooner or laterit might possibly be desirable to enter into directxnegotiations with Mustapha Kemal;: is.  in my opinion,a complete understatement of the general view.    &apos; ThePrime Minister himself said he was in favour of entering into negotiations with Mustapha Kemai,  and. the foreign secretary declared that efforts were now actually beingmade to open such negotiations-.     Certainly the general conclusion was that they were necessary and desirable,It would appear to be very -injurious that such anincomplete account should be circulated to Members ofthe Cabinet who- did not hear the discussion; and Irequest that this Memorandum may be sent to any ministers who have received its(Intd) W.S.C.10th December? 1920.x      , -        -The original draft has been amended in this respect,(Intd) BLP..A.H-.
