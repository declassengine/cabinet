? OF WAGES ? WORK IN ? OF ?EMPLOYMENT.

(1) With reference to Cabinet 54 (20), Conclusion 4, by which it was decided that the wages paid on relief work for the unemployed should, during a probationary period of four months, be only 75 per cent, of the standard district rate for work of the same kind, the Conference had under consideration an extract from the Minutes of a meeting of the Unemployment Committee (C.U. 7th Minutes, (8)), from which it appeared that great difficulty was anticipated in carrying out the decision of the Cabinet.

 The Conference also had before them a Memorandum by the Minister of Labour (C.U.49) and a Memorandum by Sir Henry Maybury (C.U.53) on the same subject.

 It was explained, on behalf of the Ministry of Transport, that in the course of the negotiations for the contributions by Local Authorities to the schemes of road construction which were being undertaken the Local Authorities had been willing to contribute much more liberally than had been anticipated, and in such circumstances the Ministry of Transport had been under the impression that the decision to limit wages to 75 per cent, of the district rate became of small importance, particularly in view of the serious objection that would be taken to such a proposal by Local Authorities in every part of the country. In consequence of this, no formal notification of the ages limit had been made to them.

 The Conference were informed that all the other conditions laid down by the Committee on Unemployment with regard to the selection for employment of unemployed men were being observed.

 Some discussion took place as to the effect of a decision to pay full standard rates on the proposals to employ unemployed ex-Service men on the Housing Schemes, but it was pointed out that it was possible to maintain a distinction in this case and pay men  
engaged on building work at lower rates during aperiod of apprenticeship, on the ground that at thoend of their time tney would be skilled craftsmenand qualified for the full wages of their craft.After hearing all the arguments, the conference were of opinion that it would be impossible to maintainthe Cabinet decision, particularly in view of the faotthat no Local Authority would agree to employ men atleas than the standard district rate, end that the men employed on road schemes would be working on the sameor similar jobs as men receiving the full rate ofviaji.es engaged on the ordinary work of the LocalAuthorities.The Conference accordingly agreed to recommend to the Cabinet  (a)&apos; That the ^eoision of the Cabinet (Cabinet54 (20), Conclusion 4) to pay only 75 percent, of the district rate on road work fortho unemployed during a probationary periodof four months should be reversal, and thatthe full standard district rate of wages should be paid on schemes being undertaken by the ^ministry of Transport for the con-struction of arterial roads:(b) That the above decision must not beregarded as a precedent in future cases,having, been tamoh in the special circum-stances of the particular work, end thstthe Cabinet must not be taken as committed to pay full Trade Union rstes on reliefwotk for the unemployed if at a laterdete schemes of relief on a largo soalobecame necessary.(2)    The attention of the Conference was called to the eas? of a young man, aged 18 years and 9 months,who had been sentenced to death by e. Court-martialfo-  taking part in an attack on military in Ireland.He was to be hanged on the following Monday, and anappeal for mercy had been received by Mr. Devlin ontho ground of youth.
It was pointed out to the Conference that three soldiers had been murdered in the raid in question, that the prisoner had been found with a revolver, which had been fired, in his hand, with one bullet in the barrel and two more in the magazine, and that it was precisely young and irresponsible men of this type who were the main cause of the present disturbances in Ireland.

 The Conference agreed:-

 That they could not recommend any commutation of the death penalty.

GERMAN NATIONALS&apos; PROPERTY. (3) The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that, after consultation with the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade, he had that day answered a Question in the House of Commons in regard to the announcement by the Government of their intention not to exercise their rights under Paragraph 18 of Annex II to Part VIII of the Treaty of Versailles to seize the property of German nationals in this county in the case of voluntary default by Germany in respect of her reparation obligations.

 The Conference concurred in the policy laid down by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his reply.
