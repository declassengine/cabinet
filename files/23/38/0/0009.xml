With reference to Cabinet 59  (20), Appendix IV (2), thequestion before the conference   was that of Second Chambers.for the Northern and Southern Irish Parliaments.    The Oon-feroncs were reminded of the following statements made byMr -/alter Long on May 18, 1920,  in the -House of Commons t-&quot;In the view of the Government, ; if you areto have a Second Chamber in the southern parliament, you must obviously have aSecond Chamber equally in the NorthernParliament.    If you are to accepti theprinciple that  there is to be protection for minorities by gno.e provision in thisBill4-&apos; and if that is to take the form ofa Second Chacber,  it must apply to theBill as a whole, and not be limited onlyto one part of it.    What the government propose to do now is definitely to acceptthe- principle of the Second Chamber forthe two Irish Parliaments, both in southern and in Northern Ireland&quot;.&apos;&quot;The Government undertake^ between now andReport, to place&apos;on the Paper a definite,schere for the constitution o f the second chamber in both Southern and NorthernIreland&quot;.It now transpired that Sir Edward Carson and the UlsterMembers were strongly opposed to a Second Chamber for theT7orthorn Parliament, and would use the whole weight of their opposition to endeavour to defeat the proposal.It was stated that the reasons  for a Second Chamber toprotect minorities were no less strong now than they hadbeen in the past.- - .At first there was? a general kind of agreement that itwas- undesirable to have a Second Chamber - for the southern parliament and not  for the Northern.The alternatives before the Conference were, therefore,as follows:-(i)  To disregard the opposition of Ulsterand -to set up a Second Chamber for the.Northern&apos;as well as for the southern parliament:(ii) To drop the proposal for Second Chambersaltogether.After considerable discussion and a short adjournment,the following proposal was made:-That- provision should be included inthe Bill that the Council of Ireland,
which was a - common meeting ground of re-preservatives both of the &quot;Northern and southern Parliaments, should havefiheduty of drawing up a scheme for theestablishment of Second Chambers in bothareas for the protection of ninori-ties/;.    This scheme .should then be remitted to the Northern find Southern Parliamentsand should be subject to their approval.If either did not approve the schemethere would be no Second Chambers.It was pointed out that this proposal had the merit thatit gave room, for a bargain between the two parties for thepurpose of providing, for the minorities in the North andSouth respectively.An alternative suggestion was that Second Chambers shouldbe set up for a period of five years and should be continuedthereafter unless the Imperial Parliament decided otherwise.There was then some discussion as to the Second schedule of Paper CP.- 050, containing proposals for a. Senate ofNorthern Ireland, which, were severely criticised on theground that there was not sufficient protection for the religious minority.The discussion.then reverted to the first alternative scheme outlined above.    It was suggested that this might be modified by permitting the South of Ireland to have its ownSecond Chamber irrespective of the decision taken by theNorth.    In this  connection it was pointed out that it was extremely unlikely that the South would decide for aSecond Chamber except as part of - a bargain providing for theprotection of the Catholic minority in the North.    It wasthe incentive: of the protecting of minorities/In the other part of Ireland which would actuate both North and South -toagrees,upon a scheme of Second Chambers.In the course of this discussion it transpired that theBill made no provision for the summoning of the Council ofIreland.After some  further discussion it was agreed  (a)  rrhat provision should be made in the Billfor the summoning, of i-he Council of ireland by the Lord Lieutenant:   1
(b) That tho Council shall have tho duty of preparing a scheme for the establishmentof Second Chambers suitable for thoNorthern and Southern Parliaments, which need not be identical.(c) That tho scheme should be subject to theapproval of the Northern and SouthernParliaments.(d) That, in the event of smou-jdmonts beingproposed by cither the northern orSouthern Parliaments, it should bepossible to bring tho question again before the Council of Ireland, whichshould be the bargaining body.V/hitehall gardens, 3.W.I.3rd November, 19 20.
