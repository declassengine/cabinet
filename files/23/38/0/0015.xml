? INFORMATION.

(1?) With reference to Cabinet 62 (20), Conclusion 2, the attention of the Conference was called to the fact that the substance of a Memorandum which had been prepared by Lord Curzon in the course of the negotiations with M. Leygues on the question arising out of the Greek elections, and which had been distributed only to the members of the Conference, had been published in the "Daily Telegraph". From internal evidence it was clear that the disclosures had been obtained from French sources.

 It was generally agreed that there was no particular objection in approaching the "Daily Telegraph" on the subject. If one newspaper refused to act on such revelations, another and less friendly or discreet newspaper would do so.

The Conference agreed:-

(a) That the question should be raised at the re-assembly of the Conference next Thursday;

(b) That Lord Curzon should use his discretion to speak to the French Ambassador on the subject.

? SFORZA&apos;S ARRIVAL.

(2) Lord Curzon stated that had med Count Sforza, the Italian Foreign Minister, at the railway station the previous day, count Sforza had expressed considerable satisfaction that the decisions and even the full discussion on the Greek question had been postponed pending his arrival.

?

(3) The Prime Minister stated that he had seen M. Leygues on the previous day with reference to Upper Silesia, and had asked him to send a message to General Le Rond reminding him of the absolute necessity that the Commission, of which he was President, about to take a plebiscite in Silesia, should act with the strictest impartiality. Leygues had consented to make such a representation.
