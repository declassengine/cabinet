irKATToNAL        With reference to Cabinet 76 (2G), Conclusion 1   and;,UR CRGAN-  . &apos;   *     . .. *jlON. to Conclusion 1 of a Conference of Ministers held at 11-30ft Conven- a.m. on May 26, 1921, the donferenoe had under considerationj on the , : 1 ...Ration,      a Memorandum by the Minister of labour (Paper C,P.-2970) onfours ofjur. the policy to be adopted by the Government in recpect of theDraft Convention, of the &quot;ashington International Labour Con-ference, on the regulation of hours of labour.It was explained that the following Motion had been putdown by Mr&apos;Barnes for consideration in the House of commons on the following day:-&quot;International Labour Conference (Ccnven-tions), - To call attention&apos;to the factthat the Government have not yet submit-ted to Parliament oertain conventions adopted by the International Labour Con-ference at Washington-;    and to-&quot;move,That, in the opinion of this House, the conventions adopted at the InternationalLabour Conference under the League of:-Nations should be submitted to Parlia-rcent:as the competent authority&quot;.The Attorney-General stated that since the meeting ofthe Cabinet in December, 1920, above referred to, he had further examined the position of the Government under Article405 of; the Treaty of Versailles., and had somewhat modified theopinion bo had previously expressed.    The Treaty required each member of the International Labour Organisation to bring any recommendation or convention adopted, before the authority within whose competence the matter lies, for the enactment of legislation or other action.    This seemedto contemplate that, although such step might, be taken, by the member of the:-&apos;   International--labour Organisation, the consent o^ the competent-authority&apos; would not. necessarily be forthcoming.    In his view,the &quot;member&quot; of the International Labour Organisation inrespect of Great Britain was the Crown, acting through theExecutive,&apos;and the action to be taken differed according as&apos; it Involved legislation or an International Convention.    If&apos; &apos;  legislation was required, the British Government were boundto bring the recommendation of the International labourConference, in some form or other, before Parliament.    They
need not press&apos; it,, but were bound to present it,. In the case of ah International Convention, if legislation were required,- that also must be submitted to Parliament. if legislation were hot required, then the Grown, i.e,, theExecutive, could decide to ratify or not, independently ofParliament*Attention was drawn to the fact that,in the present case,if the Government decided to reject the proposed limitation of hours of employment, no legislation would be necessary.    Ifthoy decided to ratify the recommendation they could only doso by legislation.    In those circumstances, were the Govern^ment bound to bring a Bill before Parliament, assuming thatthey did not intend to accept the recommendation?The Attorney-General said that the matter was open to doubt, but he thought the Article assumed that,wheneverlegislation would be required to give effect to a recomenda-tion., legislative proposals must he presented to the law-making authority.The Prime Minister pointed out that, whatever the technicalposition, it would be impossible to ratify a proposal of thiskind without the sanction of Parliament,    It would be a veryserious thing&apos;to accept a Compulsory 8-hours day which had notbeen agreed&apos; to either by workmen or employers,    It would interfere with the freedom to work overtime, and would cutathwart the arrangements the Government had made with the railwaymen,   Unlike some foreign nations,  the British Govern-ment would riot be prepared to undertake an obligation of this character in - an International Agreement and afterwards, -neglectto carry it;out.The Conference then considered in what way parliament should be informed that the Government did not propose to ratify the Eight Hours Convention,,The Attorney-General suggested that the Government should state that ratification of a Convention was an act of theCrown, that it was not proposed to ratify in this case,
and that it would therefore be nugatory to present a pro-poaal to Parliament which it was not proposed to carry out.Gn the other hand, it was pointed out that the represent-atives of the British Government at the Washington conference had made It quite clear that Parliament was to be the body which should determine whether or not the Convention shouldbe ratified.    It was explained, however, that while theoriginal draft of the Convention had used the word &apos;*Legisla-ture&quot;   the intention being that a recommendation of theWashington Conference 3hould become operative unless vetoedby th&amp; Legislature   owing to the refusal of the american representatives to accept the proposal a compromise had beenagreed on which appeared in the draft finally adopted by the drafting Committee, viz., &quot;that the Convention should bebrought before the authority or authorities within whosecompetence the matter lies, for the enactment of legislation or&apos;other action&quot;j and Mr Barnes, as Vice-president of the paris Commission, had been careful to use the words &quot;competent authority&quot; in the discussions before the main Peace Gonfer-ence.    There was no doubt, however, that in Mr Barnes1 view the &quot;competent authority&quot; meant   the Legislature.The Prime Minister took the view that it was impossibleto disregard the merits of the question.    Mr Barnes had gone to Washington at the invitation of   the President of theUnited States when it was found that the American Senatefailed to accept the Treaty and America accordingly was notbound&apos;by it.    At the sane time, the Gersan Government wereoutside the Convention, so that two of the three greatestindustrial countries were not parties to the arrangement.  -The idea had been to have^some agreement to give protection against any country taking an unfair advantage of therestriction of hours in oth-r countries, but, a3 these two great industrial countries were not parties to the arrange-ment, the circumstances had so altered that it was not right that Great Britain should be bound.
It was further -pointed out-that France and Belgiumhad not yet-Introduced legislation on the point.The Prime Minister continued that the Government should refuse to accept Mr. Barnes&apos; Motion on the merits of the case,pointing out at the same time, hut without pressing It, thatratification should be an act cf the Crown and not of Parliament.The Minister of Labour emphasised that the Government werein a position to say that they were already, in one form or another, carrying out the Conventions and recommendations ofthe Washington conference for example. In respect of unem-ployment, the care of women before and after childbirth, andthe night employment of women and young persons.     The limitationof hours of work was practical]y the only respect In which thepolicy of this country was not already in full accord with theresolutions of the Washington Conference.It m.a suggested that unless the Government were able tomeet Mr. Barnes1 Motion with a direct negative as to the com-competence of the House of Commons to ratify a Convention ofthis character, every time a resolution were passed by theInternational Labour Conference the Government would be boundto find Parliamentary time for its disbussIon,The Prime Minister pointed out j on the other hand,that it Would be a somewhat delicate matter to ask the House ofCommons for a direct vote on the question whether the Governmenthad a right to ratify an International Convention without thesanction of Parliament.It was also pointed out that, while the argument againstratifying the Convention was unassailable on its merits, theHouse of Commons was asked in Mr0 Barnes1 Motion to express the opinion that the Conventions of the International LabourConference should be submitted to Parliament as the competent authority, and might very well accept that view apart altogether from the merits of the Convention under discussion.   v    Mr.Barnes was, no doubt, of opinion that, under Article 405
a    a     *     %Whitehall Gardens, s,w.1,May 26, 1921.Of the Treaty, onoe a recommendation had &quot;been made, theGovernment had to perform a ministerial act by putting it-before Parliament, and would press that point of view/.Itwould be imprudent to ask the House of Commons deliberatelyto admit that it was not the competent authority to ratify.The Conference agreed  (a) That,the British Government should decline to ratify the Convention of the Internation-al Labour Conference relating to the limita-tion of the hours of labour:(b) That the Minister of. Labour should move-an amendment In the House of Commons to MrBarnes&apos; Motion, viz,, to omit the words in brackets:-&quot;To call attention to the fact that theGovernment have not yet submitted toParliament certain Conventions adoptedby the International Labour Conferenceat Washington;    and to move   That Jinthe opinion of this House,, the conventions adopted at the International Labour Confer-ence under the League of Nations should besubmitted to Parliament as the competent authority&apos;!and insert&quot;in the opinion of this House it is not ex-expedient in existing circumstances to pro-ceed with legislation to give effect to theWashington Convention on Houa?e of Labour&quot;:(c) That, should it be necessary, the Attorney-General should intervene,at a later stage inthe Debate,with a legal argument on the tech-nical position under the Treaty.
