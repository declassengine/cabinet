IOITY. (2) with reference to Cabinet 22 (21), Conclusion 1, inorder that the facts of the situation might be brought home to the miners prior to the important Delegate Conference tobe held n**xt week, the Conference generally agreed in princfpie in the advisability of an arresting statement being issued in the Sunday newspapers, which are widely read bythe mining community, stating the truth in regard to thefinancial condition of the mining industry.   In this con-nee t ion attention was called to a useful statement published in the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot; on the previous day.The main question for consideration was ine of prin-ciple, as to who should issue - such a statement.    The import-ance was felt of avoiding any action by the Government whichcould be distorted into a suggestion that they were takingsld.es in the dispute in support of the mine-owners.&apos; The Conference agreed -That Sir Philip Lloyd-Greame should arrangefor the publication of a statement in the sunday newspapers emphasising such facts asthe tremendous break xn prices, the lack of markets abroad,the extent of American corn-petition, the importance to our financialand industrial position of coal produced at prices which enable us to compote suo-cessfully with othrr nations in exportsboth of coal and manufactured goods, theeffect of this on wages coats p--r ton of coal at different periods, and the feetthat a temporary settlement would be of little or no value.

ANNEX   IIIReceived by telephone at 10 Downing Street, atUL.50 a.in. April 16th 1921.The Joint Conference of the National Union of Railwaymes,Transport workers, and Locomotive and liramehs&apos; Union, hasfound itself compelled to cancel the strike notices for thowithdrawal of the labour of. their respective members at andfrom 10 p.m. Friday, *..pril 15th 1921.In consequence of tho confusion which oonfrontod theConference o^ Friday morning no reasonable hope remained ofsecuring the spontaneous and united aotion of the threebodies which was so essential to give to tho Miners federation the assistance they sought.       A partial and hopelesslyincomplete sympathetic stoppage would have weakened the poweroi the throe organisations without contributing any material assistance to the miners.Up tc Thursday evening there v/as every hope of a tremendous display of working class solidarity, but circumstance-stances which have transpired since that time have destroyed the firm ground on which the oall for strike action was based.The Conference profoundly regrets the creation of theohangefi situation.     ITo other course was open to it than toarrive reluctantly at the oonolusion to call off the strike of its members.
