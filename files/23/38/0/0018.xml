begging that any draft Mandates upon which agreement hadbeen reached by the- Principal Allied powers should becommunicated at a sufficiently early date to enable theCouncil to give all the necessary information to theAssembly before the end of the present Meeting,It was generally agreed that in view of these tele-grams it was impossible to postpone a decision any longer.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS gave the  -Conference details of the various alterations which hadbeen made in the Mandate since the question had last beendiscussed, as summed up in his Memorandum CP.2197.     he drew particular attention to the Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for War, CP.2203,  setting forth the probability that the French would make more ready use than His Majesty7sGovernment ox the reciprocal freedom for the employment oftroops raised In their Mandatory area, and pointing outthat a French column was at the present moment on the move to Deir-es-Sor, and that the French Administration in Syriawas showing indications of interference on the&apos; Iforth-lastfrontier of Palestine.&apos;After a short discussion, the Conference agreedthat those considerations did not introduce any new factor which had not been before the Cabinet when it dis-cussed the question, and that the previous decision of theCabinet should be tip-held.      They felt that it would boinexpedient for the British Government to tie its hands asregards tho possible raising of troops in tho Mandatedareas for some great national emergency, -which might arise in the future, if the Mandated Governments should consent.Moreover, as the French had already put in their Mandate tothe league of Rations we should be. placed at a disadvantage-if our Mandate did not include the same privileges in thisrespect,
The Conference agreed -That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should authorise Mr.BsIfour tocommunicate the revised Manastos for mesopotamia and Palestine to the Leagueof Nations.8, Whitehall Gardens, 3J,,L
