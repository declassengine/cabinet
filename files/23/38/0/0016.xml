kflPPlEMFJiTAEY With reference-to the meeting of the Finance CommitteejiHiTY&quot; ESTIMATES^head^on&apos;&apos;Thursday, July 22nd, 1920, the Conference were informed   by the Secretary of State for War that in thecourse of the   next week he would find himself obliged tointroduce in the   House of Commons a supplementary estimate (allowing a margin of safety of .^4,000,000 or 5,000,000)  of  33,000,000 or  34,000,000.      The actualestimated deficiency was  45,000,000, but by using,savings which had materialised on several sub-heads ofthe Vote he was able to bring the gross figure down toIthe amount named0      The Supplementary Estimate, the anountof which   was greater than anything within his experience,was in the main due to expenditure in Mesopotamia.   this additional expenditure had largely been incurred on behalfof the Indian Government, but other Departments, such asthe Foreign Office, were also affected.     The War office had been obliged to borrow troops from India, which india was most, reluctant to lend and for which she charged veryhighly.     lie    wished to emphasise the difficulties which inevitably arose when Departments like the War office had to bear1 on their Votes the coot of policies over whichthey had no control.      In his own case, the War Office was called, upon to provide funds for the development of .Palestine and Mesopotamia, and, to a lesser degree, Egypt.While the War Office was prepared to find troops if andwhen necessary, he wished to urge that the cost of theseventures in the Hear East should be debited to the Vote of the Department the Minister in charge of which was respon-sible for the policy and. could effectively control theexpenditure.Proceeding further Into detail, the Secretary ofState for War mentioned the following Mesopotamian itemsincluded in the Supplementary Estimate:-Persia ........&apos;..***.....*  11,000,000.Stores ...................  2,000,000.R e.-* c conditions t i oni ng ofrailway Stock.............  1,600,000.
Items of till a kind, particularly the -last-named item, should,in his view, have &quot;been charged, to the -Mo sop ot ami an Budget andnot debited against&apos; Army Funds,     In reply to his request forproposals for reducing tho Me3opotarnian garrison, GeneralHaldane had supplied his views On the situation very fully  .in telegram 18/J/S3, circulated to the Cabinet on December1st,  1920.The Conference Were reminded that the origin of thearrangements in Mesopotamia which had resulted in throwingthe cost cf the admliiistration on. to War Office funds, wasthat, pending the conferring on Great Britain of the mandate for Mesopotamia;, the only justification for our being in thecountry was that of Military occupation..It was represehted that the, system which enabled one department to incur expenditure which the Minister In chargeof another Department had tc bear on his Vote, was from financial and Parliamentary points of view, vicious and difficult to justify,      On the other hand it was pointed,out that as soon as a situation had been, taken over by them 1 itary:--Authoi:art.i^s,. the latter claimed to. decide questionsof the&apos;-highest--imp rtance -on pur^&quot;g military grounds wit] outreference tc the Civil Authority or to the Department thatwas responsible for policy.For instance, reference was made to the permission whichhad been given for women and children to proceed to mesopotamia and for&apos; the establishment by the General Officer Commandingon his own responsibility and at great expense, of a HillStation at Karind, in. Persia.The Secretary of State for War then passed on to a detailed comparison of the new Estimate with the Estimateoriginally submitted by him to his colleagues 12 monthspreviously, and the Estimate as subsequently cut clown after discussion in the Finance Committee of the Cabinet, whichlatter was ultimately submitted to Parliaments     the comparative figures are contained In. the statement attacl 3d .to these Minutes (See Appendix I).    It should be observedthat the net amount of the Supplementary Estimate was
 29,000,000, to which, however, it-would be wise to add 4,000,000 or  5,000,000 for emergencies, making the totalSupplementary  55,000,000 or  34,000,000,     In connectionwith the figures, the Secretary of State pointed out thathe had laid   his plans on the basis of having a large force for police purposes, rather than a large army containingmany serai-trained units.     It was necessary to proceed withrecruiting because of the heavy wastage which would take placenext year.     Compared with Mesppotamia, Ireland was a smallaffair, and only accounted for an additional  1,000,000.Broadly speaking, we had only lost in Ireland one-tenth ofthe men, and Ireland, had. only cost one-tenth of the moneyexpended in Mesopotamiac     With-regard to Constantinople, theactual cost was    estimated at  3,-300,000 against  2,800,000taken in the Estimate.     As regards Egypt, the estimatedfigure seemed likely to be realised, but there would be no substantial excess.      In regard to Palestine the cost wouldbe  5,730,000 as against the revised estimate of  4,350,000,Comment was made.on the heavy expenditure in Palestine,and it was represented^tl&apos;ie.t^hi-s--was am clear case-where theheavy costs were due &quot;To&quot;&quot;Military -requirements and were net&apos;imposed on the military by the civilian authorities.It was pointed out that a substantial portion of the supplementary Estimate of  33,000,000 or  34,000,000 was required to satisfy payments for services rendered by otherDepartments       for example, a sum of over  3,000,000 wouldbe payable to the Ministry of Shipping Vote for re-condition-Ing vessels vised as military transports -- end. it was suggestedthat items of this character, which did not involve actua-1cash payments, should not be included In the Supplementary.It was pointed out, however, that if the expenditure was not shown on the War Office Vote it would be necessary for theother Department, e,g., the Ministry of Shipping, to take a supplementary Estimate.After some further discussion, the Chancellor of the&apos;Exchequer agreed to make enquiries into certain payments
which had been specifically referred to, naively, a payment to the4&apos; German Government in respect of the wages of german prisoners in England, and the cost of re-conditioningrailway material in Mesopotamia.      If necessary,Sir Warren Fisher would himself Investigate the matter withthe War Office officials, with a view to seeing whetheritems of this character could not be dealt with in some other way so as to relieve the War Office Vote from Undue chargesupon it.The-&quot;diV^amasion then passed to the political aspectsof the quo^Hicsas-..at.-ivS^appeal.^.. and the. view was generally accepted that the   House of, Commons would only &quot;grant the supplementary Estimate on receiving an assurance that this represented the end of the heavy military expenditure,particularly in the Wear East.      Criticism of the Governmentsexpenditure was becoming every day more insistent, particularly from the Government&apos;s own supporters, and it was clear thatthe   country would demand that the permanent military expenditure of the future should be vigorously reduced.This was especially the case as regards Mesopotamia and persia., and it was represented that the country would favour a policy under which the Army would be withdrawn from persia and Mesopotamia, the government of Mesopotamia in futurebeing entrusted to the Arab Administration, helped by nativelevies   and a    small British force,     As regards Persia, theConferei.ce were reminded of the decision already taken towithdraw the British forces still in that country in the spring, as soon as the passes were open (Cabinet 59 (20),Conclusion 4),The Conference agreed That the Secretary of State for War shouldbane his Estimates on the assumption.thatall British forces would be withdrawn from persia as soon as the passes were open nextyear, &quot;As regards Mesopotamia, the suggestion was again made that in futiu-e it would suffico to limit the area which was occupied and administered by Great Britain.      In th fes
connection tha Conference were informed that Jagaar Pasha,the. new Minister of Defence, in the Arab Administraion, estimatedthat Mesopotamia would require a smaller permanent garrisonthan-In Turkish times..     He proposed to raise a defendeforce for this purpose by means of a quota from each vilayet,probably by compulsory service ,The Conferexide were also informed that Sir Percy Cox &quot;was pressing on rapidly with the development of an ArabAdministration, and had already replaced half the British:Political Officers by Arabs,  ,; .It was represented that Mesopotamia could only be administered economically if the hostility of the Kemalistswas disarmed, and that if the   policy of the British Governmentwas to continue to quarrel with Mestapha Kemal It would benecessary Either to clear out of Mesopotamia altogether orto hold it in force,     A combination of the Bolsheviks andthe Kemalists would be most dangerous, whereas by negotiating with Kemal, who was stated to be anxious for a settlement,it   would be possible to extricate the troops without difficulty and to run the country in future on the lines whichhad been suggested.The Conference were asked, not to sanction any statement about a,reduction of the Mesopotamian garrison withoutSir Percy Cox being first consulted,    . They were reminded that the recent outbreak, in Mesopotamia had-only been possible  -.. owing., to the widespread belief among the natives that.we. wereabandoning the country,,     It must, therefore, be. made clear   -that our intention was to replace the British and Indian :troops by native levies.. The Conference were also Informed that,the evidenceshowed that the Turks were behind the recent ourbreak, whichhad been largely-engineered, from; without.    - In view, of -possible    threats to Mesopotamia next year from Bolshevist
and Kemalist force (a), It was urged that the date on which theactual withdrawal could be effected depended on the natureof the progress made with any negotiations opened with mustapha Kernel;.The Conference agreedThat a telegram should be sent to sir percy Cox (See Appendix II) to the effectthat the growing&quot; ciemmnd at&quot; home forretrenchment made It necessary to reconsider the Mesopotamian policy, and asking him foran estimate ,of the smallest number of trccps,British and Indian, which it would be necessaryto retain in Mesopotamia during the financialyear 1921**22, and what further, reductions couldbe made in the following years: further, would- It be possible to concentrate for the presentand re-establish our- position In outlyingdistricts as the Arab Army developed.(As the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the Secretary of State for india had to leave the, Conference, it was decidedto adjourn further consideration of thequestions raised to a meeting to be held at12.-15 p.m. on the following day, December 2nd,1920),cooocooa OOO * * * 4 * * *2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W8December 1st, 1920.

A P P &amp; R .D. IX     II.Telegram from Secretary of state to Civil commissioner in Mesopotamia; dated 1st December, 1920.Clear the line3Private.    I am very reluctant to trouble you with financial difficulties in midst of your other urgent pre-occupatiors.      But situation hero is really serious in viewof universal and often unreasoning demand for economy in alldirections and I foresee great difficulty in securingcontinued support for our Mesopotamian polioy either, from parliament or from my colleagues in the. Cabinet unless can hold out to them some assured prospect of progressiveretrenchment.      It would greatly assist me if you couldestimate roughly what is smallest number of troops Britishand Indian with which you think it would be possible to carryon during next financial year provided general conditionsdo not appreciably deteriorate, and what further reductionscan be made each succeeding year0     You need not be afraid that you will bo held irrevocably to your estimate howevercircumstances may alter.      I shall at all times do my beatto see that your requirements are properly supplied.    Butit Is essential that I should be able to state at present justice what is absolute minimum of military force requiredfor Mesopotamia supposing all goes well and you are in com-plete civil and military control, i.e. minimum without whiohit would be useless for us to stay in the country or perseverewith policy of nursing Arab State through its non-age.     would it bo possible to concentrate for the present and re-establishour position in outlying districts as the native army developsMesopotamia
Mesopotamia is now costing us over  30,000,000 a year.Could you make a forecast as to smallest sum requiredne&amp;t year?     An urgent reply is required.I do not telegraph officially for thisonly expresses a desire for a. rough idea of your viewsfor the immediate assistance of Cabinet.
