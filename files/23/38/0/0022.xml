APPENDIX.LETTER from tp.fi Minister of Labour to theBUILDING TRAD &apos;3 OPERATIVES.I have received your request of December 17th.  that theproposals of the Government should be; communicated in writing&quot;rather than at a Conference, as I proposed to you on Decemberloth.    I therefore send you the proposals of the Government.1. The arrears in suitable housing accommodation, due inpart to the reduction in building before the War, and gravelyaggravated by the total cessation of building during the War,constitute a serious hardship, particularly upon the workingclasses themselves.    The situation is accentuated by the factthat the number of skilled tren in the Building Trades is very considerably less than before the War, so that not on.lv isthe number less than would be needed to meet the normalbuilding requirements of the country, but it is wholly inade-quate to overtake the very large volume of arrears with whichthe country is confronted.    Side by side with these undoubtedfacts there are tens of thousands of young, aotive ax-Servicemen,to whom the country rests, under the most profound obliga-tion, ready and willing to engage-upon productive work, askingwork and not charity,  and finding themselves without theopportunity of earning, that decent.subsistence to which theirsr-r^ipr$ to the country in the hoxrr o^ its necessity soabandon1.1 y entitle t hem.2. The Government is of opinion, therefore, that the absorp-tion into the Industry of a large body of ex-Service men asadult apprentices or trainees&apos;, with a view to becoming skilled,craftsmen should be commenced-forthwith.    The numbers to be absorbed should be on the basis of one in five calculated onthe number of skilled men.&apos;In the whole industry, but the&apos;proportion must vary in different trades.    The highest per-eentages should be applied to the three.branches of theIndustry where the need is greatest, namely, Bricklayers?,Slaters a^d Tilers, and Plasterers, and the minimum numbjerof men thus admitted to the skilled crafts for housing  fur-poses shall ho not leas than 50,000.    The proportions to, beadmitted in the various crafts above specified will be &apos;?arranged with the Minister of Labour, j3. In return for an undertaking to admit and train theseex-Service men, the Government is&quot; prepared to make a TrainingGrant, of  5 per head to the Unions for each man admitted tothe Trade Unions concerned and trained in any of the trades iithe Building Industry.    This grant will be paid as follows:-- 2 on admission to training. 3 at the corr-pl&apos;-tion of the training.Men actually appointed as instructors of the new entrantswill be rated and paid as leading hands, ?&apos;4,&quot;The Government accept the principle of a guaranteedrate of pay on housing operations for time lost owing to wetand inclement weather, sub;)&apos; ct to the Trade Unions accepting the augmentation set out in paragraph 2;..   and are prepared t\provide for the application on Housing Schemes of this,principle on the following basis, viz,.:-
&quot;In the case of a man employed, or standing by to work on a job when called upon, for&quot;afull week, the payment for time lost throughstress of weather shall be 50 per cent. In&quot;respect of time lost up to 22 hours per week. -In the case of time lost in excess of 22hours, the hours lost over and above 22 hoursshall be paid for at the rate of 7.5 per cent. &apos;of the tire rate&quot;.5, .Th?? Government&apos; appreciate the anxiety with whichBuilding.Trade Operatives view the prospect of considerableadditions to the membership of their craft.    In &quot;the years immediately before the War, and mainly in consequence of thereduction in the number of houses built, as described in thefirst&apos; paragraph of this letter, the Building Trades were subject to frequent and grave periods of unemployment, with- allthe hardships entailed to the families of the workers n    Havingregard, however^ to the great arrears of Building !&apos;ork .through--,out the country -- arrears which roust be made good at theearliest possible opportunity -  and to the admitted shortage in the number of skilled men in tho Building Trades as corn-pared with the pre-war days, the Government are of opinionthat no risk of unemployment is involved in their proposals.If,,however, their confidence is not shared by the Unions,-it is within the power of the industry.as a whole to provide against this contingency.    An -ami ended Unemployment Insurance -Act has been placed upon the Statute Book this year.    ThatAct provides a Benefit of 15/- a week which, if the TradeUnion cares to become the agency for administration, becomes  ...at least 20/- a week by an additional contribution of at &apos;least 5/- a week from Trade Union Funds.The Training Grants mentioned in Paragraph 3 above wouldpro&quot;id^ a substantial foundation for any addition which theUnions may desire to make to the provision under the Insur-ance Act.    -6. I shall be glad .if you will, place this communicationbefore your Executive;    and, in view.of the pressing urgency of the matter, the Government desires me.to ask for a replyby the end of the year.-S3-
