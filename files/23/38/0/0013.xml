TRADE RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA.

(1) With reference to Cabinet 62 (20), Conclusion 4, the attention of the Conference was called to the growing importances, from a political point of view, of pushing on as rapidly as possible with the Russian Trade Agreement.

 Evidence was accumulating that a bad period of trade must be anticipated this winter: a Deputation from the London County Council had waited the previous day on the Prime Minister and had pressed for drastic legislation to obtain land for the unemployed; information had been published in the Press of gigantic orders obtained by Mr Vanderlip, an American citizen. Whatever might be the truth as to these alleged orders said to have been obtained by Mr Vanderlip for American goods, or as to the prospective orders to be placed here, it was estimated that from a political point of view it was desirable to remove all Governmental obstacles to trade.

 The Conference agreed -

 That the Cabinet should meet on the following morning, in the House of Commons, at 12 noon, or immediately after the Service in Westminster Abbey, to consider the Reports of the Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs, War, and India, on the Draft Russian Trade Agreement (Paper C.P.-2138).

  
SET    (2)   The secretary.3-.ary of Stats for Aar raised, as a matterof urgency, the terrible and destitute condition of the hordeof refugees from the Crimea, now concentrated in the Constan-tinonl^ area   consequent on General WrangoVs collapse.    Allreports agreed that these people were in a rost desperatesituation, crowded, without food, in hastily improvisedcamps, or still on board ship, exposed to great risks of an outbreak of pestilence^    The French were rendering assistance and had dealt with about 40,000,    The Americans were also stated to be helping tin to the limits of their capacity on-    the spot.   Mr Churchill stated that on the previous Monday hehad sent a telegram to the General Officer Commanding, inwhich, after repeating the decision of the Cabinet to avoid any re-equipment of Central Wrangel, he had informed him thathe was not debarred from giving - such assistance as he couldon the grounds of humanity.    Mr Churchill now asked that theGeneral Officer Commanding, Constantinople, might be allowedtc spend up to  20,000 on the work of relief.The Conference agreed --(a) To approve th   action already taken bythe Secretary of State for ftar, as sum-ma rised above:(b) To anprove in principle- the further pro-posai&quot; o** the Secretary of State for war that the General Officer Commanding* Oon-stantinople, should be authorised to spenduo to  20,000 in relieving destitute civilianrefugees, particularly women and children,and the sick and wound&apos;:d,  on the clear.   - understanding that there should be nosemblance of&quot;participation in any steps for the r:-equipment or re-formation ofGeneral &apos;Arangel* e forces&apos;.(c) T&apos;bat  the Pria e Minister, in the course ofthe&apos; negotiations with the Russian Trade^le^ation, should raise the question ofthes;: and oth-r Russian refugees, witha&quot; v^ ew to th&quot;&apos;ir repatriation to Russia.
x o 5SITUATION       (3) Arising out of the foregoing -discussion   tlv- Chan-AUSTRIA. &apos;^       cellor of the Exchequer called attention to the fact thatthe British Government were almost alone in rendering assist-ance to various bodies of refugees in different parts of theworld.    In. addition to the maintenance of refugees in Egypt,Mesopotamia and Lemnos, we had spent large suras in settlingrefugees in Serbia, where we had had to guarantee the SerbianGovernment against loss.    He was about to circulate a Memoran-dura to the Cabin.;.t dealing with the position of Austria, whichthe Reparation Commission reported to be hopeless.    The Corn-mission itself had no resources out of which to sustain Aus-tria, and the matter was th?rerore. being referred by them tothe various Governments.    In the opinion of the Chancellorof the Exchequer the time had come when His Majesty&apos;s Govern-meht must,.in the interests of the people at home, resist .these constant appeals to assume external financial burdensthe greater proportion of which our Allies endeavoured to throw upon this country.The Conference tooh note of,  and generallyendorsed these views, -
THE TWUSSTS (4)FThe ^-HxfOTertaBe had -9 fericl&apos;&quot; discussion on the preoara-PINANOES. &apos;&quot;tion of Estimates by the differrant ^eparti&amp;errts-,...and theChancellor of the Exchequer stated chat he was circulatingto the Cabinet Committee on Finance a Mots dealing with theBudget Estimates for the current year as now revised, withestimates for the following year, arid with suggestions for economy.It was agreed  (a) That the Finance Committee should assembleat an early date to r view the wholefinancial situation of the country, withspecial reference to the menace of gravetrade depression:(b) That the President of the Board of Tradeand the First Commd.seloner of Works shouldbe added to tho Committee. 1&quot;
.p.NT OP      (5)  Tho Conference had before tfc*n Conclusion 3 of theIDREN IS RELATION 78V- Meeting of tbm Committed of Home Affairs, dealingSHIFT SYSTEM, with the employ:, ent of women and children in factories byshifts.    The subject had ber^n fully examined by a DepartmentalCommittee appointed by the Home Secretary (Cmd.1037), andthe Committee had approved the continuance o^ the two-shift system for an experimental period of five years.    The HomeAffairs Committee r comraended to the Cabinet that steps should it.be taken to secure the passage of amendments in the report stage of the women, Young Persons and Children1s employment bill, for the purpose of carrying out the recommendationsof the Departmental Committee.The Conference concurred in the roeom-mendation of. the Home Affairs Committee.
RAIL-FAY COW-      (6)      The Conference had before them the followingCP&quot;. SI OH 3 TO&apos;TROOPS IN THE    documents on the subject of Railway Concessions to united KINGDOM.Troops in the United Kingdomj-*Memoranda by the Secretary of State forWar and Air dated 50th June and 19thNovember, 1920 (CP.1622 and 2121).y, Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer, dated November 24th,  1920,(CP.2156).It was explained that the concessions which had existed before the war had been considerably extendedduring the war, but that:it was now proposed to reducethem below the pre-war scale... The chief argument infa  :ur of reduction was that the pay of Officers andme.-;: had been very considerably increased, - and it didnot seem reasonable that they should continue in addi-tion to burden the public purse with the cost of theirrailway privileges.After hearing the views of the Secretary of Statefor Far, the Chancellor of the Exchequer consented toagree to some further concessions and it was finally agreed(1) that the following concessions should remain or be restored in cases wherethey had    lapsed(a) The arrangement whereby parties oftroops of 10 and upwards attendingmemorial services and military funer-als were allowed, return tickets on payment of single fare and a half  ;(b) The arrangement whereby .competitorsteams, working parties, horses, guns,etc.; proceeding to the Royal Tourna-ment were conveyed at single farefor double journey ;(c) The arrangements affecting RifleClubs, whereby soldiers in uniformproceeding for shooting practice were allowed return tickets on paymentof single fare and a third.(d)

That the conoossion by which Officersproceeding on -leave aro allowed a returnticket on payment of single fare from cortainmilitary otations to London, should be limitedto Offioero on 7 days1 loavo.--7-

(7) With reference to H.A.C. Conclusion 78, Minute 1, the Conference had under consideration the question whether the unexpended balances of the proceeds of taxes on motor vehicles should be surrendered unto the Exchequer at the end of each year, or should be allowed to accumulate in the hands of the Ministry of Transport from year to year. It was maintained that this procedure would establish the principle of a private purse owned by Government Departments which would not be liable to be called on to meet the general ? of the nation. The Conference were, however, informed that the question of principle had been settled in 1909 and that, in the opinion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, it was not possible to administer the Road Fund efficiently unless the proceeds of the motor vehicle taxes were allowed to accumulate in the hands of the Ministry of Transport who would then be able to elaborate schemes which would operate for several years at a time.

 Attention was drawn to the length of the Bill. It was urged that, as the Bill would have to be passed into law before the end of the present year, it should be drastically reduced in size in order to allay Parliamentary criticism as far as possible.

 The Committee agreed:-

(1) To approve the principles that the unexpended balances of the proceeds of taxes on motor vehicles should not be surrendered into the Exchequer, but should accumulate to the credit of the Road Fund.

(2) That the Minister of Transport should scurtinise the Bill very carefully with a view to reducing it to the smallest possible proportions and eliminating all provisions which were not immediately essential.

(3) That the Minister of Transport should have authority to introduce the Bill after all possible reductions had been made in it, into Parliament -      
? AND WHEAT ? (8). With reference to Cabinet 63 (20), conclusion 8, the Conference had before them the interim recommendations of the Sugar and Wheat Committee (C.P.2155) which were that, as from Monday, November 29th, 1920, the price of sugar should be reduced from 1/- to 10d a pound retail and the price of flour by 4/ a sack.

 The Conference were informed that the Government were pledged by answers to questions in the House of Commons to adjust sugar prices from time to time to the "ruling world prices".

 The Sugar and Wheat Committee, therefore, thought that the reduction of the price of sugar by 2d. next Monday was unavoidable but that it might be possible  to resist any further reduction. In regard to wheat the position was complicated by an agreement between the Government and the Millers, guaranteeing the Millers their pre-war profits. The agreement could not be terminated without six months&apos; notice and the Millers had power to refer the question of termination to an independent tribunal.

 Some doubt was expressed as to whether the present prices for sugar could be regarded as "world prices" and the Conference were informed that the Sugar and Wheat Committee would consider very carefully whether it was not possible to avoid any further reduction of retail prices on the ground that present prices were artificial.

 As regards wheat, it was suggested that every possible effort should be made to replace the present agreement with the Millers by a new agreement which would enable decontrol to take place earlier than under the old agreement.

 The Conference agreed:-

(1) To sanction the recommendation of the Sugar and Wheat Committee that, as from Monday, November 29th, 1920, the price of sugar should be reduced from 1/- to 10d. a pound retail:

(2) To sanction the recommendation of the Sugar and Wheat Committee that, as from Monday, 29th November, the price of floor should be reduced by 4/- a sack.
