FRANK HODGES&quot;,A ehert discussion followed as to the desirability,even at this late hour, of trying to arrange a farther andnominally unconditional meeting between the two par: Las,but, on a full review of the circumstances, it was agreedthat no useful purpose would be served by such further attempt.It was agreed -That the Prime Minister should send thefollowing reply to the Miners&apos; Federation:-&quot;10, Downing Street, S.W.1,April 8th, 1921.Dear Mr Hodges,I have received your.letter, and I notewith the greatest regret the decision atwhich your Committee has arrived.In view of the grave consequences involvedit is difficult to understand how any discus-sion designed to promote a settlement could usefully proceed unless we were all agreedthat the first task should be to seuure thepreservation and safety of the mines without which there must be widespread and continuedunemployment and distress, not only for those whose occupation is in the mines, but for thewhole industrial population.-1-
blNG CUT (2) The Conference were informed that under the ReserveRESERVES ,- Forces Act, 1882, Article 12 (1), as an essential preliminaryliamentaryicedure.     to the issue of the Proclamation calling up the Army Reserveit was necessary for tbe occasion to be communicated toParliament under Sign Manual from the King.At the present moment (4 p.m.) His Majesty was atWindsor Castle.   Under the Standing Orders the House ofCommons must, on a Friday, rise by 5*-30 p.m.   In view of the\^-.*&quot; immediate and urgent need to issue the Prbelamation, theproblem facing the Conference was how to overcome the physical difficulties af procuring the message with theKing&apos;s signature attached before tfis House rose.The expedient of asking the House to meet on Saturday&quot;was deemed inadvisable, if it could be avoided, as it would &apos;iswolve a debate, which, In the present obscure position,acould not help the situation, and had better be postponed until Monday.After telephonic communication with Lord Stamfordham,at Windsor Castle, and communication by the Leader of theHouse of Commons (Mr Chamberlain) with the Speaker, thefollowing procedure was concerted:-(a) His Majesty the King graciously consented to proceed immediately to Buckingham Palace&apos;?(b) The Secretary of State for War undertook tohave the message ready and to make all ax- -       /rangements for its signature on the King&quot;arrival at Buckingham Palace, and for for-warding it to the House of Commons?(c) ^&quot;he Speaker agreed, if there was not tire-   left for the Prime Minister t- if!.&apos;&apos;-; ..Jstatement and for the House V;&apos;, lz?King&apos;s message, to express -he vio-*  hatSo far from placing any obstacle whateverin the way of negotiation, the action of theGovernment has been dictated solely by a desireto remove the main obstacle that stood in theway of fruitful negotiation.   The mines arevital to the life of the community;    theirdestruction is as fatal to the nation as would have been defeat in war, and to secure their preservation ijJust be the paramountduty of Government,,Yours faithfully,(Sd.)

APPENDIX.CONFIDENT IAL.   .C. P. 2812INDUSTRIAL SITUATION,Statement made by the Prime Minister in Parliament onFriday, April 8th, 1921.Before the House rose last night I intimated that I proposed to ash the Coal-owners &apos;and the Miners&apos; Federation toa joint conference at which the first subject for discussion should be the pumping and preservation of the mines, it being understood that, until that question was disposed of, noother matter should be taken up.     This morning I acted inaccordance with that intention, and addressed to the&apos;Miners&apos;Federation the following letter10&quot;Downing Street,Whitehall., S.W.1.8th April, 1921.Dear Mr. Williams,&apos;   In the course of the Discussion in the House ofCommons last night certain suggestions were made byLeaders.of the Labour Party which have led me to make toyou a further proposal for a meeting with the miners federation * in order to make a start towards a solution ofthe present dispute. &apos;-A suggestion was made to the effect that aConference might be summoned by the Government which should deal in the first instance with the question of the pumpingand preservation of the mines and that that matter shouldbe disposed of before any ether question was entered up or?.The .Government has considered this suggestion and I havenow to invite your Association to send representatives at.12. o&apos;clock no&amp;n today to a conference to be held at theBoard- of Trade upon these terms.Yours faithfully,Evan Williams Esq. ,(Signed) D, LLOYD GEORGE.

The answer of the Miners&apos; PederRtlon^obvixraslx did no-tmeet the point which I had put, viz., that the questionof freeing the mines from water should first be discussed and dlseosed of, and 1 accordingly-addressed to Mr. Hodgesthe following letter10.,- Downing StreetApril 8thjl921yDear Mr. UodgesI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of thismornings     You state that you desire to be free to discuss&apos;&apos;fully every aspect of the present situation with a view to ar-riving at a speedy a,nd honourable conclusion.     This is alsothe wish of the Governments    He have never suggested that any limitation should be Imposed upon discussion, but as regardsthe order in which matters are to be discussed the national interest in the preservation of the mines is paramount and itmust take first plac0e    v.*hile tfhe mines are hourly being floodsed and ruined and ohe of the most valuable of national assetsbeing destroyed it is impossible to expect other questibks tobe debated..    Accordingly the question of the safety of; the minesmust first be discussed and disposed of before other matters are taken up.I therefore invite you to a Conference in this sense andwill be glad if representatives of your Federation will attend atthe Board of Trade this afternoon at 3 o!clock for this purpose.Ycjtirs faithfully.,(Signed)   .d.. LLOYD GEORGE.I have now received the following reply the MINERS1 FEDERATION..April 8th, 1921.Dear prime Minister,I have to inform you that your further letter has been con-sidered by my Committee.     v&apos;e note your clearly stated condition that the question of the &quot;safety of the mines must first bediscussed and disposed of before other matters are taken up.&quot;^e think the condition stands in the way of a resumption of ne-negotiations*As previously stated we are willing to meet the owners andthe Government in conference at once if we are allowed to meetunconditionally*     We trust that the government will raise no obstacle to ensure this end.Yours truly,sd.. Frank Hodges.  .
From those co?rrnuni cations.&apos; and .from the statementsdeliberately made at the meeting with me yesterday it isplain that the Executive &quot;Committee of the &quot;linersFederation are resolved to let the mines go to destruc-tion In the belief that they will this intimidate theGovernment into a surrender to their  remands *The desperate character of this policy is visible inthe disastrous effects which it will have on the livell-hood of the miners themselves. &apos;   hole villages whichderive their entire support from the mining industry will&apos;.become -derelict, and thousands of families will be deprived of the means of existences   And from the pointof view of the nation as a whole the results are not lesscalamitous.   Coal is the foundation of Industry., and towreck coal-mines or allow them to be ruined by floodingis to strike at the life of the whole body of olid sens0It is accordingly the duty of the Government, as the trustee of the nation, to prevent this catastrophe, moreespecially.as it is becoming increasingly clear that insome places at any rate largo organised bodies of minersare, by threats of violence, preventing this necessarywork being done by the mine officials and others willingto helpcProtection and ade -uato protection must be given tothose who are engaged in preserving those vital assets of the - community.    No other course is open to us.   Thenation is, for&quot; the first time in its history, confrontedby an attempt to coerce it into capitulation by the dec-truetion of its resources, and this menace is apparentlynow to be supplemented by a concerted plan to suspend the transp rt services, which snv essential to the life ofthe country i;-.&apos;
If the threatened railway and transport workers strike takes place the supply of food and of other immediate necessaries of life will be  denied to all classes of the population unless volunteers come forward to carry on the minimum of transport work required to maintain the most essential national and municipal services. The government proposes to call for volunteers to help carry on these services, and announcements will he made telling volunteers at what centres they should apply to be registered and instructed as to the help which they can be stafford?.

These too will need adequate protection in the discharge their patriotic duties while it is no less essential that, in the face of such a widespread disturbance of the ordinary machinery of the life of the community, law and order should be effectively maintained. The police force,, even when strengthened by the enrolment of special constables, for which an appeal will be issued, will obviously be insufficient for this task in view of the very large, number of points that require protection and of the organised character of the interference with the voluntary workers. They are entitled to look to the Government for protection and help from the armed forces of the Crown in their difficult task. This protection the government has decided to afford them in whatever measure may be necessary, and therefore proposes to make a special appeal to patriotic citizens to enlist in an emergency force, recruited not for the purpose of interfering in any wage dispute, but solely to support the Police in the fulfilment of their duties to the community.

Enlistment for this force, which we propose to call the Defence Force, will be for 90 days at the ordinary rates of pay and allowances. The Territorial Force will not be embodied or asked to serve, but members of the Territorial Force and ex-Service men generally will be specially invited to enlist. Enlistment will commence tomorrow at the Territorial Drill Halls and Headquarters.

The Government have also come to the conclusion that it is


necessary, the same objects in view, to strengthen the armed forces of the Crown now serving, and I have therefore advised the King that a situation has arisen in which, he is justified in a sanctioning the issue of a Proclamation calling up the Reserves of the Army, Navy and Air Force.

The cause of the present dispute is being represented in some quarters as a deliberate attack upon the wages of the worker. There is no justification of any kind for this suggestion. The Government have never pronounced any opinion, nor have we formed any, upon the rates of wages which have been offered to the miners by the coal-owners: they have not even been discussed between the parties. When our services were offered in attempting, to bring the parties together upon that matter the reply of the miners was that it was of no use unless the Government were prepared to subsidise the coal Industry. It was clearly acknowledged by the miners that at the present tine the proceeds of the coal industry are not sufficient to yield the wages which the miners demand and the only ? presented to the Government by the miners is one for an immediate subsidy from the Exchequer. To this proposition the Government have been unable to agree, for reasons which have already been fully stated and are easily understood.
