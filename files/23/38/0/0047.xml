He himself, however,felt strongly that the British nations would be moreassured of obtaining their share in reparations if thecollection were made in Great Britain on tho lines ofthe 50$ sanction, than if it were made in Germany.There appeared to be two alternativesI  (a) To continue to collect the 50$ of german exports or some lesser percentage, sincethe German Reparation.Pecoverfy Act put50$ ae a maximum;   or(b) Td broposa a -eniform 85$.The total to be raised was 82$ on the totalreparation furnished by Germany^ that is to say, 22$on  100,000*000 per annum, plus 22$ on the 85$ raised on German exports.The objeot of the meeting, the Prime minister  explained was to oonsider whether it was administrativelypracticable to collect the iaoney here,  instead of inGermany.  *yThe suggestion was made that the Germans mighttry to force up prices against us.     It was pointedout, however, that the Germans would have to- pay the85$ in any case.     It was immaterial to  tiiem whetherthe sum tff&amp; collected in Germany or. abroad.It was/** 1 w

Germany by sendinggoods through Holland.. or . other -neutral, -countries, noton through Bills of Lading, but by consigning to neutralmerchants and manufacturers.The general trend of the discussion went to showthat the collection of the tax on German imports in theUnited Kingdom, instead of as an export tax in Germany,was administratively practicable.The Prime Minister invited the experts ,to give careful considerationto the question, after which the Presidentof the Board of Trade and all the expertsexcept Sir Basil Blackett withdrew.IMPOSITION   2,       The Conference &quot;briefly discussed the application ofOP BLOCKADE.-a blockade of German ports.     It was pointed out that whilethe blockade was practicable, its application v*ould arousepublic opinion on behalf of the women and children^ whowould suffer under it.It was generally agreedThat the Blockade should be held inreserveand should not be resorted to until some experience of the Ruhr occupation (ifundertaken) had been obtained:Further, while the attitude of the minorneutral countries might not be of greatImportance, it was essential to be assuredin advance of tho attitude of the UnitedStates and of our legal position before putting the blockade into force&amp;r , Whitehall Gardens, ..3rd May, 1921,
