?ITUDE OF POSTAL AND TELEGRAPH EMPLOYES.

(l) The Conference were informed by the Secretary to the Post Office that the post and telegraph employ√©s had asked to see him in order to express their determination not to carry out "blackleg" duties in connection with the impending strike of the Railwaymen and Transport Workers. He had informed them that they would be expected to carry on the ordinary postal and telegraph services of the country.

The case which raised the most acute, difficulty, Sir Evelyn Murray reported, was that of a guard in uniform accompanying the mail in a van, or perhaps a lorry, which would have to be driven by voluntary labour. In disturbed districts such persons would be liable to assault.

The general view was that the post-and-telegraph officials must carry on their ordinary duties, but should not be asked to handle extra-ordinary traffic in connection with the Strike, and that the Post Office should issue instructions to the effect that the local Postmasters must use their discretion, in cases of real danger, to allow postal vans driven by volunteer labour to proceed without a postman guard. In this connection the Conference were reminded of the precedent of certain railway  stationmasters who had refused during the Railway Strike to carry out their ordinary duties in the case of trains driven by volunteer labour, and had been dismissed.

The Conference agreed --

That the Secretary to the Post Office should draft instructions to Postmasters in the above sense, and that, in the absence of the Postmaster-General, he should, before issue, submit the draft for the approval of the Chairman of the Supply and Transport Committee (The Minister of Transport).


uitude of    (2)      The Prime hinister gave-the -Conference an&apos; iwaymen.account of the present position, which ia summarised&quot;below.On the previous evening at about 8 p.ia. thePrime, Minister had received a message from Mr.Thomasasking him to receive a deputation from the Hsilwavnenand Transport Workers who wished to announce their intention to commence a sympathetic strike in favourof the miners.The Prime Minister had received them at 10 a.in.when they had announced their intention to strike on tuesday, unless in the Interval negotiations were resumed between the miners end mine-owners or government.The discussion had concentrated at once on thedifficulty of re-opening negotiations while no arrange-ments were being made to prevant the destruction ox the mines, end the Prime Minister had emphasised&quot; that theposition of the Government had been they could not undertake what must be a prolonged discussion on the-details ol wages while the mines wera rapidly being left to destruction.     He hod told the miners that onthis very morning he had summoned a meeting to considerthe measures to be taken&apos; for the protection ox the mines.Kow, he hfcd asked, we a it.pocaible for the Governmentto negotiate at length with the miners while they werepre-occupied with so grave a consideration?       The Government were not concerned either with the interests of theminers or of the mine-owners, but those ol tho nationTawhich imperatively demanded the 8afety of the mines.He lied made it clear, however, that once the safety oftho mines was.secured the Government wore prepared to
t ake the&quot; initiative--on,jrewjpening-ja^^trLarti ons .     3 olong, however, rs the miners ware molesting^par&amp;ona.employed by the Government in the protection oi -thomainas-^whether volunteers or the staff of the mines, which wasone of the reasons for creating the new special defence force, the Government could not take this action.Mr.Thomas and Mr.Bevsn had pricked up their earsat this and Mr.Thomas had asked definitely whether, inthe event of the Miners&quot; Federation being willing toarrange for the preservation of the mines, whether &quot;byordering the pump men hack or in the alternative hyundertaking to cease molestation of those engaged in the mines, the Government would initiate a resumption of negotiations.     To this the Prime Minister had replied   \in the affirmative.liter an adjournment the Deputation had informed the Prime Minister that on the understanding that theycould come hack more than once if necessary to 10, downing street they would like to adjourn to put this propositionto the miners.     The Prime Minister had, of course,consented to this and had then pointed out that so longas the Railwayman and Transport Workers remained aa itwere neutral they were in a very good position for acting as intermediaries, hut that the moment they went on strike they &quot;became, as it were, parties to-the dispute.Mr.Thomas had then emphasised that, at any rate, untilTuesday they were in a position to act as intermediaries.It -had &quot;been agreed that there should be nocommunication to the Press until after the return of theDeputation to 10,.Downing Street.
(5)   The Conference were Informed that the-CabinetCommittee on Internal Protection Arrangemnts were of opinion^that the number of troops available was entirely inadequate to meet the situation in Scotland;, where there were only three weak Battalions.     The Admiralty had been able to placesome 400 to 500 Marines at the disposal of the Committee, andthese were now on their way to Scotland.     The Committeewere of opinion that, apart from the calling -up of the reserves, which would double the emitting Battalions, itwas essential to have additional Forces available, andthey had therefore sanctioned the movement of 4 battalions of troops in all from Ireland.The Conference heard a general statement by the solicitor-General for Scotland regarding the situationin that country, which was to the following effect;- onWednesday, April 6th, enquiries showed that in the whole of .Pife pumping had been closed down.     In Midlothian there hadbeen progressive stoppage of pumping activities, and pumpingwas ceasing at the rate of two or three mines a day.     Thesame was true of Ayreshire.     Lanarkshire had shown the bestresistance, but pumping was also closing down there.     the disturbances had been caused largely by a peripatetic bodyof extremists, including Bolsheviks and Sinn Feiners.     Thedanger was that this body might move its activities into other districts which were not affected at the moment.In consequence of the telegram from the Prime&apos;Minister, which had been despatched on Wednesday, the solicitor-General for Scotlalid had conferred with AdmiralHeath, at Rosyth^ and the General Officer Commanding,Edinburgh, regarding troops and naval ratings availablefor protection.     The situation disclosed was a s follows:-(i) A Battalion of Gordons to protect Glasgow:(ii) A Battalion of Highland Light Infantry., atEdinburgh, which possessed a       aking^foroeof 100 men; who could be detached for service elsewhere:
\iii4-A-.Bal^talJj5n^ ..____________^Tftia Battalion formed, in fact, the onlyreserve for the whole of Scotland, aince*-^  the other Battalions were allocated to Glasgow and Edinburgh.The General Officer 0 qtmnanding was of opinion that it wouldhe very dangerous, to. draw on the Battalion of Seaforths, andthe conclusion had been reached that it was impossible tocomply with requests for the protection of pits on WednesdayApril 6th.    On Thursday, April 7th, the Solicitor-General^     ct j ,   ,       -     separatelyfor Scotland had conferred^ With the General Officern ^       ^,.arJd Admiral Heath.Commanding, Edmnhixgh^/arid had made the following arrangementsIrrespective of the adequacy of the force available, theMilitary and Naval Authorities must respond to any appeal ofthe Civil Authorities --(a) For assistance in effecting arrests and thereby keeping the ordinary criminal procedure in operation:.(b) For assistance to Sheriffs, with a viewto maintaining order and protecting pro-perty.lAmiral Heath would have at his disposal a bfrdy of, 150Marines who were already at Rosyth, and a further 400 to 500Marines who were on their way.    In addition, there was athough not trained for land work,certain number of Naval ratings who/could be used for pro-in the last resort,tection. purpnses^   Arrangements had been made, i.i necessary,for a sloop to anchor in Methil Harbour, and it was thoughtthat the moral effect of this would be good.   As regardsOo-wderib^ath the situation was very difficult;    the youngerelement therR was v^ry extreme, and bo^h Admiral Heath andthe General Officer Commanding, Edinburgh, had stated their inability to afford        continuous protection to the mines,but had undertaken temporary protection.On Friday, April 8th,  the Solicitor-General forScotland had consulted again with Admiral Heath and theGeneral Officer Commanding, Edinburgh,   At this conference it appeared that the Sheriffs in Lanarkshire and the chief constables were averse from the introduction of troops, since
.... 2 52a disturbance.they feared Arrests were being made with&apos; fairsuccess.   The situation was different in Fife, and he had given instructions that the Police must abandon theirpossibly too friendly attitude towards th? strikers andmust immediately effect arrests.    These instructions hadbeen given yesterday, and he hoped to hear today of arrestshaving been made.   Arrangements had also been made in theIiothisns for certain suspected persons to be arrested.The mine-owners had been Interviewed in regard tothe elaboration of a schere of protectionTjhey had put forward a scheme and had unanimously selectedGowdenbeath as the danger point which required protection.When offered the alternative, they said that they would prefer that th* Military Authorities should support theCivil Authorities in making arrests, than that a military force should be detailed to protect certain pits while otherpits were left unprotected. -As regards transport, certain difficulties had arisen in providing transport at Retford, Rosyth and other places,but he had arranged that the necessary material should beobtained.    The difficulty was the lack of drivers, and itwould be necessary for authority to be given to him to recruit motor transport drivers voluntarily.Some discussion ensued as to the danger arising fromthe activities of the peripatetic bedy of extremists, and itwas unanimously agreed that this body could not be allewed todefy.the Civil Authorities, and that protection&apos;in the worstareas should be immediately, afforded.As regards Edinburgh and Glasgow, the opinion was expressed that &quot;those Cities should be able to protoot them-selves, and so free the troops at present stationed therefor operations in the disturbed districts.    Th- danger wasthat if disaffeot-d elements in Lanarkshire saw that theFifeshire riots were not suppressed, they would follow suitand th   trouble would spread.   Attention was, however, drawn
to the fact that as regards Glasgow a well-organlcsed and armed body of Sinn-Feiners existed there, and it was suggestedthat the lord Provost should be given discretion as to whethertroops should be moved away from Glasgow,After considerable discussion, the conference agreed as follows(a) * That every effort should be made to breakup the organised gang of rioters in Fifeshireand to arrest the ringleaders%(b) That the General Officer Commanding, Edinburgh,should be Instructed to release the maximum number of men possible from Glasgow, for usein the disturbed areas s(c) That the 4th Worceater^hire^BattalJLon, which.&apos;was arriving that day from Silesia, should 4be sent immediately to Scotlands(d) That the body of 500 Marines whi.ch._had been organised by the Admiralty should be despatchedimmediately to Scotland:(e) That the local Military Authorities In scotland should be Impressed by the War Office withthe necessaity of placing all availableforces in the Field and not retaining themIn barracks.- 7 -
The Conference were informed that the situationvin^^outh^Walep was dangerous and the population ofTonypandy was restive.     The pumps at Mid Rhcndda had ceased at 6 p.m. the previous night and this would Involvethe flooding of many pits.     The G.O.C., Western command had despatched 3 Companies Sf the Yorkshire &amp; LancashireRegiment to Cardiff.     These troops were not sufficientto enable guards to be placed at the pit heads, but theywould be retained in Cardiff and would stand by there.The opinion was expressed that unless the disturbed areasin South Wales were taken In hand, serious trouble would arise and that action should be taken immediately.   Witha view to dealing with the situation the conference agreed as follows(1)   That the Admiralty should imediatelyform a battalion for service on land from such naval ratings as wereavailable, this battalion to be underthe Army Command In Wales; and theWar Office to notify the Admiraltyof the particular points at whichit should be Igaa&amp;ed.(2)   That in view of the expected arrival of troops from Silesia one battalionshould be moved immediately by railway from London to Wales for the purposeof freeing the 3 companies at Cardifffor use in the disturbed areas.
