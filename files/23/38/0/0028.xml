(1) With reference to Cabinet 72(20), Appendix III, the Prime? Minister informed the Conference that he had undertaken? to meet an influential Agricultural Reputation that afternoon on the question of the prices to be paid for home-grown wheat, and he thought it very desirable that the question should be considered by the Conference.

He took the opportunity of welcoming Sir A. Griffith Boscawen as Minister of Agriculture, and referred to the Minister&apos;s eminent services in connection with the passage through the House of Commons of the Agriculture Bill.

The Minister of Agriculture said that he wished to give the Conference the farmers&apos; point of view of the difficulties which had arisen. Last March, in consequence of a Cabinet decision, the maximum price for home-grown wheat had been raised from 76/- to 95/- per quarter of 504 lbs. On March 12th the Prime Minister had given the following pledge in the House of Commons:-

"So long as wheat is still controlled and thereby deprived of a free market, the controlled price of home-grown wheat of sound milling quality harvested in 1920 shall be the monthly average (c.?.f.) price of imported wheat of similar or comparable quality, provided that the price so paid to the home grower shall not exceed 95/- per quarter of 504 lbs".

In pursuance of these arrangements the millers had been instructed to raise the maximum price payable for home-grown wheat to 95/--, and up to November 6, 1920, the farmer had actually received 95/-. About that date, world prices showed signs of falling and millers ceased to accumulate wheat, while the farmer began to force his wheat on the market. In the result, many farmers had in point of fact sold wheat below 95/-- between November 6th and January 26, 1921, the date on which the decontrol of wheat was announced.

The farmers contended that they had a guaranteed price, but the true position was that the 95/-- was only guaranteed so long as two conditions were satisfied:- 
(i) That wheat was&apos; itill controlled and thereby deprived of a free market:.(ii)  That the world price was in excess of95/-.:In point, of fact, the. pledge given by the Prime minister had not been carried cut between November 6 and January 26,for the reason that; no; adequate machinery existed to secure its fulfilment,.   -  ...The farmers claimed to be paid the difference in price between the amounts actually realised in sales betweenNovember 6 and January 26 and 95/-.    The aggregate amount Ofthis difference was estimated at between   120,000 and  150, OOCbut it must be remembered that payment, of this sum would notthe whole of the farmers1get rid of/ grievance,.inasmuch as manyfarmers had tried - to-make sales during the period but had failed.In addition to the above-named claim, the farmershad a further claim based on an answer given by himself (SirA. Griffith Boscaw en)---en April 19, 192.0, which had beenprepared in consultation&apos; with the Mio;. t -Gorr-ildsi^u-/&apos;and&apos; whichwas intended to amplify and explain the Prime Minister&apos;s        /pledge on March 12th.    This reply read as follows:--      &quot;The price to be paid for-British wheatof souvd milling &quot;quality will be announcedeach month an.dVwill-.be the average of the.c. I.f. cos t of al 1&apos;- &quot;milling&apos;- wheat importedduring the two&apos;&apos; preceding months&quot;- and of the- actual.-ahd anticipated&apos;arrivals&apos; ih: the&apos;. Unit ed&apos;: Kingdom during the-current rr-months,      &apos;-subject&apos; to an adjustment -In&quot; -hespect ofthe lower percentage- Cf-&apos;--flour of&apos; equalwater content obtainable from;h*me-grown&apos;wheat as compared with imported &quot;wheat,-;.and subject also to a maximum of 9 5/- a&apos;&apos;. &apos;quarter* .Home-grown wheat of sound milling  -quality will be defined as wheat  of fair&apos;%      average quality for the season fit formilling into flour for human consumption,in reply to- the specific enquiries in thequestion, the term &apos;similar or comparablequality&apos; refers to the&apos;percentage of flour--&apos; &apos;   obtainable, and the prices will be adjustedaccordingly^    Consequently, in view of thefact that British wheat yields on the&quot; averagea somewhat Tower&apos;percentage of flour of equalwater content than, imported wheat, the maximum price of 95/- will be payable for british wheat so long as the &quot;average price of imported wheat- Is&quot; in excess of that figure&quot;.
&quot;The- -^axrrra^ that wheat was still controlled so longas- the. mills Were controlled, so long as there was a fixedprice for flour,., and so long as the Government prescribedthe extraction, percentage,, and that, this being so, they (the farmers) were entitled to the benefit of the bi-monthly average cost of imported milling wheat price arrangementsindicated in the last-named pledge.   ;Cri the assumption thatSjOOo^OCO quarters of wheat of the 1920 harvest remained inthe hands of the farmers,, the maximum Cost to the Exchequer ofnot be likely toagreeing to this second claim wculd/amount to        more, than 1.500*000, and might be substantially less.The Prime Minister stated that the impression left ohhis mind of the previous discussions was that the government did intend to guarantee the farmer 95/-- for this 1920 hardest,.the idea being tc give him every inducement to maintain and extend the cultivation of wheat.    There was no doubt that farmers generally had. read the Government pledges as guaran-teeing them. 05/- for this harvest.    The farmer was a verysuspicious individual, and if ho got the idea that he wasbeing deceived c.r trickedj the consequences might be veryserious, and the great hopes of increased agricultural pros-perity5 based on the Govenmient! s agricultural policy,, mightbe doomed to die appointment,    While he was disposed to agreethat the words used lid- not in fact amount to en absoluteguarantee, he was inclined to.think that the beat policy would be to admit the&apos; justice of the claims *    It was perfectly&apos;&apos;,&apos;-&apos;.&apos;..&apos; -.&apos;&apos;-- - ..&apos; .rot-\;-g;v.It?clear that- the conditions, of his- pledge of March 12th hrcybeensatisfied in&apos; the case of. the period November 6 to -Oai uary 26 vand the G-o&apos;v-t-o-:h^il would in any case have to pay the diIteranceon any sales whbhih that /period up to. 95/-.Objection - as. taken to a policy of&quot; complete Surrender,on the ground tb-at there had&apos; been considerable misreprosenta-tiOn about the farmersr case.    For example, the farmers hadalleged that the mills were so over-stocked with wheat thatthe millers had been unable to buy,, and that so far from, the.        &apos;      &quot;       - -3-&quot;
farmers having heId-up.wheat for higher prices, they had beenplacing large quantities on the market;     These statements were incorrect,,,     Since October last, the stocks of imported-whoatat the mills had been steadily going down, and on February lstp 1921.were lower than they had been fer three years     The ho^s grown wheat crop;.of ,1920 was an unusually small $ns? but the percentageof this vCrpp sold to date was actually higher- than in 1919,So far from the Wheat Commission having squeezed the farmers,,the reverse was the case-, and the farmers had been allowed toaverage sales of wheat tc the millerss with the result that insome cases more than 95/- a quarter had been paid.It was then suggested that possibly seine compromise mightbe reached with the farmers on the larger claim, and it waspointed out that under no reading of the pledges could it bacontended that the farmer should receive 95/- if the c.I.f,cost of imported whsat fell below that figure.On the other hand, It was generally agreed that theGovernment would have to abide by the Prime Minister1s pledgeas extended and interpreted by Sir A. Griffith Boscawenfsanswer in..the Hcuss cf Commons on April 19th, 1920, and that Itwould be inequitable to repudiate the latter arrangements,Which had been designed to help the Government on a risingmarket, when in point of fact the conditions were reversedand the arrangement had turn 3d schatcht unfavourably to the State.-..Under the schsme: the price payable for this month*s wheats-based on the average of December and January and March would bo95/-, while the price for next April and following months &apos;would probably be below 9s/-The Conference were then reminded of the great practicaldifficulties which would arise if in effect the Government gasgpa guaranteed 95/- to; every farmer who,sold his wheat before January26, and refused the, same figure&apos;io farmers who- by design oraccident, had not effected sales until after that daT.e.    Inany case,, there might be a rush of&apos;selling with no pxirchasers, .--a and/
and this might necessitate the setting up of some central machinery for the purpose of the. State acquisition of the--crop*The Chancellor of the Exchequer Informed the conference that he would have the greatest possible difficulty infinancing such an operation.     he thought it most deplorablethat it should be necessary to contemplate the continuedcontrol of the floUr mills until September next in order to market the1920 home-grown wheat;. and he was assured that every effort was being made to brihg this control to an end,but that the millers, who had the benefit of the agreementwith the Government, had hitherto refused any substantial modification of the terms of that agreement, and it seemed probable that nothing could be done to accelerate itsexpiration before June 30thnext.The Conference agreed-.(a) That the Prime Minister, who was to be accompaniedby Sir A. Griffith Boscawen, LCrd Crawford, and a  -hepresentative of the Ministry of Food, should,endeavour to negotiate the best possible settlement with the farmers; representatives^ generally on thelines indicated in the foregoing discussion:(b) That, in particulark the farmers should be assured of the intention of the Government to carry outthe pledges given, in a generous spirit; and thatthey, should be requested to co-operate with theGovernment concerned.in deylsing the best kindof machinery by which the pledges could be implemented.

(2) The Conference were informed by Mr. Balfour that, at the request of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, he had had a lengthly interview with Prince Sapisha and the Polish Charge d&apos;Affaires, in the course of which the discussion turned on the question of Dansig. It should be remembered that, under the Treaty of Versailles, Dansig had been separated from Germany and from Poland, and had been placed under the League of Nations, which had appointed a High Commissioner to under take the general administration of the place. Under the Versailles Treaty, Danzig had to make a special Treaty with Poland. That Treaty had in fact been drawn up and signed, but as yet had not been ratified by the Poles. At the recent meeting of the Council at Genova, the question was raised of giving Poland a mandate to defend Danzig. This proposal, which was supported by the French, was, of course, misconceived in its origin, since there had never been any intention of applying the mandates system to any European territories. In support of the proposal there was produced to the Council, the Report of a Technical Commission which had recommended that Poland should have the right to erect an aerodrome within three miles of Danzig, and also to fortify the town against possible attacks. Mr. Balfour said that he had strongly opposed this suggestion in the Council, feeling sure that in a doing he was voicing the views of the Foreign Office and the British Government. He had pointed out that the suggested mandate for Danzig was quite irregular, and that the proper course was for the two communities to endeavour to live peaceably side by side, his opposition had somewhat astonished his colleagues in the Council, who had thought that the proposal would go through without any criticism. In the end it was agreed that the High Commissioner for Danzig should be asked to report on the proposal. The Report had been received, and was understood to be very unfavourable to the Polish contentions. This being the position, Prince

  
Sapieha had told him that the Poles would never have signed the Treaty with Danzig if they had not been informed by the French that they would be given this mandate as  a matter of course, and that no objection on the part of Great Britain was to be apprehended. He (Mr Balfour) had pointed out to Prince Sapieha that the adoption of the proposal would involve Poland in most serious difficulties with Germany, and that the Polish proposal seemed to him most unwise, whether considered from a military or a political point of view. It then became clear that the Polish Government was not anxious to defend Danzig in the event of an attack, but to coerce Danzig and its inhabitants. Prince Sapieha had stated that last summer, when Poland was in the midst of a serious crisis, the strike at Danzig had only been overcome by the help of British sailors. Similar difficulties might happen again, and Poland would have no security that the only open port at her disposal might not at any moment be shut by one of her enemies. Mr Balfour said that he had assured Prince Sapieha that he would be quite ready to examine any safeguards which Poland might wish to propose, or, if necessary, to strengthen any existing safeguards. Subsequently he had taken Prince Sapieha over to the Foreign Office, and the whole question had been further discussed with Sir Fyre Crowe and Sir Cecil Hurst. Prince Sapieha had again stated that Poland had only signed the Treaty on the distinct understanding that she should have thee mandate, and he had added, though without intending to be miniatory, that he felt confident he would have the utmost difficulty in persuading the Polish Diet to ratify the Treaty unless he could give satisfactory assurance respecting the ?.

(At this point the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Sir Eyre Crowe entered.)

Sir Fyre Crowe said that there was no Justification for the suggestion that the British Government favoured the conferring or a mandate of the kind suggested on Poland.


At a Meeting of the Council of Ambassadors in Paris a Resolution;;hftd. been passed to the effect that the League of Nafetons mightcants ider conferring a &quot;mandate&quot; upon Poland in the event of?:&amp;n attack being made on Danzigo     He explained that somemisapprehension had arisen owing to the use of the word&quot;mandate&quot;, the sense in which the French word &quot;Mandate&quot;had been employed in the Recommendation of the Conferenceof Ambassadors did not correspond at all to the English &quot;mandate&quot;in the Articles of the Covenant.     It simply meant &quot;authority&quot;.The French view certainly was that Poland, should be informed now that, in the event of an attack on Danzig, she would beregarded as the natural defender of the town and ought to makeher military preparations accordingly.was pointed out that from a military point of view this might be an absurd suggestion, Inasmuch as itpresupposed that the best way of defending Danzig would be by putting Polish troops into the town.      Itw as quite clear that$he Polish Government really wanted to send troops into Danzignot for purposes of defence, but in order to prevent strikes and to coerce the inhabitants.The Conference agreedThat, in discussing   the question of Danzigwith -Prihce Sapieha. the Prime minister should generally support the views on thisquestion which had been given by Mrc Balfourto the Conference.2., Whitehall Gardens, S.W\,1.21st February,, 1921.
