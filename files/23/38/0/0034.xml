(1)   With, reference to Conclusion 1-of&quot;the&apos;Conference ofMinisters held on April 7, 1921, the Prime Minister reported the latest developments of the Coal Dispute.   A3 a resultof the attitude of Labour Members in the Debate in the Houseof Commons dh the previous evoking, the Prime Minister,after discussion with such of kis colleagues as were avail-able at a late hour, had this morning written both to theMining Association and to the Miners&apos; Federation sendingthem a fresh invitation to attend a meeting at the Board ofTrade at Nobn today, it being understood that the questionof tbe safety of the pits 3hould be disposed of befi re anyother business was discussed.During- the meeting of the Conference, an acceptancewas received from the Mining Association, and this was fol-lowed later by a letter from the Miners&apos; Federation express-ing their Willingness to attend a meeting without preliminaryconditions as to what was to be discussed, and stating thatthey were prepared to discuss every aspect of the situation with a view to arriving at a speedy and honourable settlements.(Fbr the exact terms( of the above corres-pondence, which is bf seme importance,See Apperdix.)(O.P.^2809.)After considerable discussion as to whether a Confer-ehep could usefully be held even without the -preliminarycondition that the question of the safety of the mines shouldbC disousied first^ the Conference agreed  That .the Prime Minister should reply in.the terms.of letter&apos; No.4 to be foundin the Appendix.&apos; -(This letter was despatched towardsthe close of the Meeting.)(2) The Conference had before them a recommendation fromthe Committee on Internal Protection Arrangements, in favour o:(a) Calling cut the Reserves:(b) Raising the proposed Defence Force:(c) A confidential warning to GeneralOfficers Commandingthat the Territorial Force would
. not be called out, but that it was in-tended to raise a special Defence Force,The Conference wore informed that.the Scottish mine-owners &quot;had appealed for support^ but that- the Welsh mine-owners were inclined to deprecate.the use of military force,or even extensive use of volunteers for pumping,&apos; as calculated.to stimulate hostility, - - -The view waa advanced, and met with considerable sup-port, that if force were employed at all in the mines it mustbe-adequate, and it was pointed out that, owing to the small numbers of the regular forces available, this at once raised the question of the provision of increased forces,A new factor bearing on the decision to be taken,which was introduced during the meeting, was the receipt of.an announcement by Mr J.H, Thomas that the -Railwaymeh andTransport Workers, at a joint meeting&apos;,: had decided to strike,-subject&apos; to confirmation at a meeting, of the Triple Alliance tobe held the&apos; same afternoon.It was pointed out that the creation&apos;of the new forces would not contribute towards the immediate saving of the minesexcept insofar as the existence of growing reserve forces wouldenable the troops now available to be utilised-more/freely.&quot;Apart from the withdrawal of troops from Ireland,which was not deemed advisable beyond the three Battalions&apos;.already brought in,, it was recoghised, that the raising ofadditional troops was the only method by which a materialincrease in the forces available could be effected.It was further pointed out that a. favourable response to an appeal would provide a great moral demonstration as tothe sentiments of the nation,The Conference agreed (a) That if the Miners&apos; Federation should refuse the invitation to a further meeting, thefollowing recommendations of the CabinetCommittee on Internal Protection Arrange-ments should be adopted:-
(i) The immediate issue of the Proclamationscalling out the Navy, Army and Air PoresReserves:,(ii) That the Secretary of State for War should at the same time &quot;be authorised to proceedwith the raising of the proposed defence force,and took note that the Secretary of State for War had warned, in the strictest confidence, theGeneral Officers Commanding-in-Chief thatit was not the intention Cf His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to embody the Territorial Forces&quot;,but that should the necessity arise it was intended to raise a special Defence Force,for which authority would be seht by tele-gram.(b) That the following Cabinet Drafting Committee should meet at. 2-30 p.m. to consider the statements to bemade in Parliament on this subject the Prime Minister,, . .   -s. Lord, Curzon,Mr Chamberlain, /Sir Robert Home-,Sir Laming Worthington Evans,Dr. Macnamara,Mr. McCurdy,(c) That the Home Secretary should be authorised toissue an appeal for Special Constables, which itwas thought would not adversely affect the re-.. cruiting of the new special Defence Force.(d) That Mr H.A.L. Fisher and Sir Philip Lloyd-Greameshould draft a statement making a special appeal... to every miner, for consideration by the drafting committee.(e) That the Secretary of State for War should prepare for the Drafting Committee the statement to be madein Parliament dealing with the Reserves and DefenceForoe. . ..(f) That care, should be taken by the Civil Commissioners.to prevent confusion in the enrolment of special constables and Volunteers, and that the clearestpossible instructions should be issued as to the places where Reservists and recruits for the defence force should report themselves.S OPBAL TOAl AU-WTIBS,.  (3) The Conference took note that the Prime Minister&apos;8appeal to the Local Authorities, which had been forwarded to the various districts for publication in the event of the
present emergency- arising^ was dated April 6th.   It was felt,however, that this would not be very material, as by April6th. the position was sufficiently serious to necessitate the Government taking precautionary measures....itehall Gardens, S.W.1,April 8, 1921.-4-

You state that you d esiro to bo froe to discussfully overy aspect of the present situation with a view to ar-riving at a speedy and honourable conclusion.     This is alsothe. wish of the government     Wo have never suggested that any limitation.should be imposed upon discussion, but as regardsthe order In which matters are to be discussed the national interest in the preservation of the mines is paramount and Itmust take first placo,     YJhile the mines are hourly being flood-ed and ruined and one of the most valuable of national assetsbeing destroyed it is impossible to expect other questions tobe debated.     Accordingly the question of the safety of the minesmust first be discussed and disposed of before other matters are taken up,I therefore invite you to a Conference in this./Sense andwill be glad if representatives of your Federation &quot;will.attend atthe Board of Trade this afternoon at 3 o!clock for this purpose,,Yours faithfully,(Signed)    D.
