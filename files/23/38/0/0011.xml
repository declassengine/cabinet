OUT-OF-WORK DONATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.

(1) With reference to Cabinet 38, Minute 6, the Conference considered a Memorandum by the Minister of Labour on Out-of-Work Donation and Unemployment Insurance (Paper C.P.-2026). The Memorandum pointed out that the extension of Out-of-Work Donation at 20/- a week for ex-Service men comes to an end this week, and the Unemployment Insurance Act comes into force. The Act made no provision for the large number of ex-service men belonging to trades not previously insured who may still be unemployed. To meet this situation the Memorandum indicated two possible courses: either to extend the present Donation for a further period, or to pass a short Act amending the Unemployment Insurance Act and increase the benefit under that Act forthwith to 20/- and fix a higher rate of contributions from employers and workmen, to be paid as soon as the necessary administrative arrangements could be made. The Amending Act should also provide a special benefit to ex-Service men enabling them to receive 20/- a week for a maximum of 15 weeks between the date when it is passed and the beginning of July next.

 On behalf of the second course it was urged by the Ministry of Labour that it had the advantage of absorbing the special class of ex-Service men into the insured population of the country, and that the cost of the increased benefits in the interim period might fairly fall on the accumulated balance of the Unemployment Fund, in as much as that Fund had grown largely owing to good employment during the War and to the operation of the Out-of-Work Donation since the War. There were, however, in the opinion of the Conference important Parliamentary objections to the proposal to amend an Act which had not yet come into force, and to amend it in a direction which had been advocated in a Committee of the House of Commons and strenuously resisted by the Cabinet only a few months ago.

 
;       HiThe -Conference agreed  i;j (a) To a further extension of Out-of-YJbrk&apos;I&apos;.-..&apos;. .

When the matter !was considered&quot;by -the &apos;H6me- Affairs Committee &apos;the extension &apos;was generally supported, and it was believed that the contracting Departments of the Governmont would offer no opposition. &apos; ; &apos;The Conference agreed&apos;&quot;&apos;--(a) To recommend t-at the Cabinet should issue, , . instructions , that.
