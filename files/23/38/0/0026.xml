UNEMPLOYMENT GRANTS COMMITTEE.

(1) With reference to Cabinet 74 (20) Conclusion (20) Conclusion 2 a, Lord St Davids called attention to a letter which he had addressed to the Prime Minister dealing with the slow progress which was being made by his Committee in making grants to Local Authorities.

Up to the present it had only been possible to allocate some £73,000 out of the £3,000,000. He therefore asked that the condition laid down restricting the grant to 30% of the wages bill of additional men taken on for local schemes should be altered to 60%.

The concession recently made which enabled the Committee to deal with roads other than main and arterial had not proved of much value owing to the condition attached by the Treasury that the Committee were not to assist except in cases where the scheme involved an expenditure of not less than 50% of the cost on labour. Experience showed that schemes suitable for assistance had a labour cost varying from 15; to 30%. Lord St Davids asked that the limit of 50% should therefore be removed.

The Conference adjourned the discussion until the following day so as to enable the Chancellor of the Exchequer to be consulted.

PROPOSED EXTENSION OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ACT.

3) The Minister of Labour stated that the unemployment question was becoming increasingly serious. By April 1st 300,000 ex-soldiers will exhaust their out-of-work donation and will have nothing to fall back on; 500,000 now being helped under the Unemployment Insurance Act will have exhausted their 8 weeks benefit by April 1st: of 400,000 who are on short time about one half will have run out of benefit by April 1st. In his view the most helpful method of relieving the problem was by means of a temporary extension or amendment of the Unemployment Insurance Act whereby the allowance to civilians should be raised from 15/- to 20/- and the soldiers now in receipt of out-of-work donation brought under the Act at their present rate, wiz., 20/- This was in effect the original proposal put forward by the President of the Board of Trade when Minister of Labour but rejected by the Cabinet partly because of the increased contribution required from the State, and partly because when ordinary wages had fallen nearer to pre-war levels 20/ might encourage widespread malingering. Owing to the many millions involved and to the fact that cards were already in circulation it would be administratively impossible to revise the respective rates of contribution before July 3rd. The deficit would therefore have to be met either by a direct grant from the Treasury or by means of the Insurance Fund which stood at about £24,000,000 or from both sources. The sum required was variously estimated at from £11 to £15 millions. The Government Actuary was investigating the problem and his report would be circulated shortly. After July 3rd it would be possible - subject to legislation - to revise the contributions so as, it was suggested, to make the contribution of the State the same as that of the employer and the employed person respectively. This would mean an additional permanent charge on the State.
