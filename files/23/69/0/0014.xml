1.   The Prime Minister consulted his colleagues on a suggestion made privately to him by the archbishop of Canterbury that the Government shouldassociate itself in some way with the observance of January 3rd, the first Sunday in the New Year,as a Special Day of Prayer for the welfare of thenation.   He recalled that in October, before theGeneral Election, the two Archbishops and theFederal Council of the Free Churches had publishedan appeal for continuous prayer to culminate on thefirst Sunday of the New Year.   He informed theCabinet that since then he had been urged from various quarters, but not including the Archbishops,that the Government should ask the King to call aSpecial Day of Prayer.    He had resisted this stiggestionmade almost immediately after the General Election,on the ground that the essential conditions of sucha day were a unanimity of response and solemnity.If a day were called so soon after the Election itwas inevitable that it would be misrepresented amonga not inconsiderable section of the community as aday of partisan thanksgiving.   There could, therefore,be no certainty of securing the two essential condi-tions mentioned above.   These objections were accepted at the time by those who had approached the Prime Minister.    The Archbishop of Canterburynow proposed to issue something reminding the peopleof the October appeal, and suggested that Jaraary 3rdbe treated as a Special Day;   he had ascertained that the King might be ready to associate himself with this to the extent of authorising His Grace tostate in his &quot;reminder&quot; that &quot;The proposed observance of the day meets with the entire approbation andendorsement of His Majesty the King&quot;,   The Archbishophad now invited the Prime Minister, on behalf of theGovernment, to support the appeal also in one of-1-
the two following ways:    either to join with him and the Free Church Leader in signing jointly aletter for publication asking for the prayers of all for the welfare of the country on the first Sundayof the New Year*    or, alternatively, to send aletter for publication saying that he and hiscolleagues were mindful that the first Sunday in theNew Year was set aside as a Special Pay by theArchbishops and the heads of the Free Churches asthe culmination of the continuous prayer for which&quot;they had appealed in the autumn;    that he earnestlyhoped that all sections of the community would participate in that Day, and that his colleagues and himself would draw real encouragement therefrom.The Prime Minister pointed out that the Kingrsendorsement to the observance of the Day would notnecessarily involve Government participation, as in1915,  1916 and 1917 His Majesty authorised by directarrangement with the Archbishop the publication ofan intimation similar to that referred to above ina letter in which the Archbishop called the nation to prayer in connection with the War,   There was no suggestion that His Majesty should be asked to call the nation to prayer by Proclamation, as was donein 1918.The Cabinet agreed that on the present occasionit would be better that the Government should not participate officially in any appeal which the archbishop might make that January 3rd be treatedas a Special Day of Prayer.
LAND VALUATIONLAND. VALUETAX.f previous reference:Cabinet 50(31), Con-elusion 7.)F.R.2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer (C .P .-307 (31)) onthe scheme included in the Finance Act, 19 31, forthe valuation of land and the imposition of a LandValue Tax.   After a detailed examination of the new factors in the situation resulting from recentfinancial, economic and political events, theChancellor of the Exchequer reached the conclusionthat it was now impracticable to defend the contin-uation of the expense of the valuation, and he proposed that the Valuation Clauses of the finance act should be suspended.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that hehad felt obliged to summon a Special Meeting toconsider this question, as the Chancellor of theExchequer bad to make an announcement on the subject in the House of Commons on the following afternoon.The question was discussed throughout in a spiritof earnest desire to meet the political difficultiesof those who had supported the measure in the lateParliament.The proposal of the Chancellor of the exchequer was criticised partly on matters of detail, butalso   on the ground that it was contrary to theusual practice for a Government to reverse thelegislation of its predecessors.    It was argued that suspension was tantamount to repeal.While it was frankly recognised that the principle involved was one which the political Partiesrepresented in the Cabinet approached from differentpoints of view, it was generally felt that as amatter of practical politics it would hardly be
possible to persuade the present House of commons to continue this expenditure at a time of drasticeconomy and burdensome taxation.    In this connectionattention was drawn to the opportunities that would present themselves to opponents of the measure for raising the question in Parliament as one of economy,as it involves expenditure from the Votes not only of the Department of Inland Revenue but also of theOffice of Works for rent of premises, and of theMinistry of Agriculture and Fisheries for maps.The Cabinet was reminded that in the course ofthe Parliamentary Debates on these proposals therehad been indications that the principle of anIncrement Value Duty might now be acceptable even to those who were opposed to the Land Value Tax,particularly if the Duty was imposed in connectionwith the development of town planning.    It wassuggested that the political situation might be eased if the announcement of the suspension of theLand Clauses for reasons of economy were to be accompanied by a statement that the national government was exploring the question of whetherthe practical difficulties of administering anIncrement Duty (in cases where the improved valueof land is not due to the owner&apos;s efforts) couldnot be overcome, with a view to the resumption of valuation when the financial situation should permit.The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed hiscolleagues that he had already given his Departmentinstructions to examine this proposal.    The general view of the Cabinet, however, was that it would notbe advisable, at the present stage, to make anannouncement on these lines, and that it would be-4-t
preferable for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to announce that the scheme was to be suspended for reasons of economy.The Cabinet agreedThat the Chancellor of the Exchequer,taking into account the discussionsummarised above, should announce that for reasons of financial stringency it had been decidedto suspend the Land ValuationClauses of the Finance Act, 1931,but that this decision &quot;was taken without reference to the merits of the scheme and did not involveits annulment.
Ic-OVEBNMEM&apos;:IBUSINESS.S (previous ousI Reference:1 Cabinet 75I (31), Oon-I elusion 12.)I      FR3.    The Prime Minister said that he had to make an announcement in the House of Commons almost immediately as to the date of the re-assembly ofthe House of Commons.   This date was determinedby the fact that Easter, 1932, fell on March 27th.The last date on which Parliament could rise forthe Easter Adjournment, therefore, was Thursday,March 24th.   Working to this date, he had made acalctilation, of which he gave particulars to theCabinet, showing that Parliament would have tomeet not later than Tuesday, February 2nd.    even this date only allowed       days for government legislation before Easter, after allowing for private MembersT time&quot;^   Ailowing^H days for the easter Adjournment,  11 days for the WhitsuntideAd j our nment /, and assuming that the House would riseon July 29th, there would be       whole sittings forGovernments buoinorxr. *The Cabinet agreed  (a) That Parliament should be asked tore-assemble on February 2nd:(b) That Private Members&apos; time shouldnot be taken before Easter:(c) That the Resolution for the Adjourn-ment should be in the same form ason the last occasion, that is to say,enabling the Speaker to summon theHouse at short notice, if required:(d) That the following Bills should be ready for second Reading,   if necessary,in the Houseof Commons in the week beginning -February 2nd:-THE MERCHANT SHIPPING (safety and LOAD LINE CONVENTIONS)  BILL.1   THE TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING BILL.THE CHILDREN BILL.Bant Shippinggrey and Load^Conventions)ifsious Reference:Hnet 79 (31),llius ion 7 .)B?own and Country-arming Bill.devious Reference:cabinet 55 (31),   ^Bolus ion 14.)Hbhildren Bill.Envious Reference:Cabinet 53&quot; (30),^blus ion 1.)
It was suggested, that the Town Planning bill and the Children Bill might be put down fordiscussion on the same day, if necessary.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,December 7, 1931.
