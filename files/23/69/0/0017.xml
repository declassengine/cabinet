HE NEW CUNARDLINER.guspens action of  Work.(previous reference:Cabinet 62(30), Con-conclusion 12 ,)1.   The Prime Minister drew the attention ofhis colleagues to the announcement made by theBoard of the Cunard Steamship Company in that morning&apos;s Press of their decision to suspend workon the great new vessel under construction atClydebank,The Cabinet were reminded that the Cunard(Insurance Agreement) Act had been passed inorder to provide facilities for insurance essential for the construction of the vessel.The President of the Board of Trade was on theGovernment Bench in the House of Commons when thesubject was raised.    A copy of an answer which he proposed to give in the House of Commons to aSpecial Notice Question was obtained .and read tothe Cabinet.   Afterwards the President of theBoard of Trade was present for a short time whilethe subject was discussed, before returning tothe House to give his Answer.The Cabinet deeply regretted that no means couldbe found for completing the new liner, which was intended to secure once more for this country the blue Riband of the Atlantic.    They appreciatedalso that this would involve heavy unemployment, bothdirect and indirect.    It was felt that cessation of construction would have an unfortunate effecton the estimation in which we were held, andpossibly on our credit.    In existing circumstances,however, the Cabinet saw no alternative toacquiescing in the policy announced a few minuteslater by the President of the Board of Trade inthe House of Commons  (Appendix).
STERLINGVALUES.(previous reference:Cabinet 87(31), Con-elusion 7.)ex2.     The Cabinet agreed  That the Cabinet Committee appointed on the previous day to considercertain currency matters should include in its survey the questionof the Control of Exchange, whichhad latterly been the subject ofsome public criticism.
(The Cabinet postponed discussionof the Prime minister&apos;s Memorandum(CP.-311 (31)) during the absenceof the President of the Board ofTrade.   The interval was occupiedby a statement by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs as to theprogress of the negotiations withthe French Government on the subjectof the French Surtax.)FRENCH TARIFFS .iNew Surtax.(previous reference:Cabinet 87 -(31), Con-clusion 8.)3,   The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that the British Ambassador -in Paris had heard privately that the FrenchGovernment had decided to give satisfaction onthe question of Coal, subject to some concessions to French public opinion.   They could not repeal the Surtax, but they would find some means of meeting our wishes so.far as Goal was concerned.He gathered that a French Official would probablybe sent to London to assist the French ambassador on the subject, with a view to a settlement.   Hehad just heard that Lord Tyrrell was to see M. Lavaland M, Briand the same day at 3 p.m.   The ambassador had emphasised that it was most important that nothing be said in the Press.The Cabinet were informed, that a telegram from paris, published in one of the London morningpapers, had stated that a strong Note had beenreceived in Paris from His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs addedthat the French Ambassador had told him on theprevious evening that he expected to have a communi-cation to make almost immediately.(A.t this point the President of theBoard of Trade returned to the Cabinet.)

The Cabinet resumed consideration of thePrime Minister&apos;s Memorandum (CP.-311 (31)),beginning with paragraph 4(c), entitled &quot;FiscalPolicy11.After consideration of paragraph 4(c) and the remarks thereon in paragraph 6 of the PrimeMinister&apos;s Memorandum, the Cabinet agreed  (a) As regards, the Balance of Trade,that the following arrangements should be made for obtaining thefacts with the least possible delay:-(i) The information contained inthe First Report of theCommittee on Economic Inform-ation of the Economic AdvisoryCouncil (CP .-242 (31)) shoxildbe brought xip to date:(ii) The Board of Trade should prepare a Memorandumembodying the very latest figures and opinions as to how we stand in the matterand as to the direction of movements.   The treasury should communicate to theBoard of Trade any informationthey may have or may be ableto obtain which bears on thissubject;    for example, as tomovements of capital affectingthe balance of payments.(b) That the above information should be circulated as soon as possible to aCabinet Committee, composed as follows -The Chancellor of the Exchequer,(In the Chair),The Home Secretary,The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,.The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The Secretary of State for the Colonies,The Minister of Health,The President of the Board of Trade,The Lord Privy Seal,The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries-who should report to the Cabinet onthe subjects arising out of the memoranda, making such comments asthey might think fit for the guidance
of the Cabinet. In the event ofan adverse balance of trade beingdisclosed, the Cabinet Committeewere asked to advise what remedieswere available and what would bethe consequences in each case oftheir adoption.
5. The Cabinet had a short discussion of a preliminary character on their Economy Policy.They were reminded that a more permanent policy would require to be devised, and the effect ofsome of the action taken in circumstances ofgreat pressure ought to be carefully examined.In this connection the Cabinet were reminded thatan early decision would be required as to Unemploy-ment Grants.The Cabinet were informed that soon after theend of the present month no money would beavailable for new grants.    For the moment thiswas not very material, as there was ample work inhand.   A policy would have to be decided, however,early in the New Year.    In this connection it wassuggested that Unemployment Grants might in future be confined to work of a definitely remunerativecharacter.   Reference was made to the possibleimprovement of Inland Water Transport.6.    Reference was also made to the question ofSmall Holdings and Allotments, and to the valuablework done by the Society of Friends and the WinterDistress Society in assisting with the provisionof tools and seeds.    On the suggestion of theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries the cabinet agreed  That these matters should be looked into- by the Cabinet Committee on agricultural Policy appointed onthe previous day (Cabinet 87 (31),Conclusion 6).

APPENDIX.SUSPENSION    OF WORK ON THE NEW CUNARDER.STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADEIN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, ON FRIDAY,   &apos;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;DECEMBER 11th, 1931.MR. RUNG I MAN-;The Board of Trade were informed confidentiallysome days ago that the Cunard Company considered itnecessary to suspend for the present the building ofthe new express steamer.The reasons for this decision are given in thestatement which the Cunard Company have issued totheir shareholders and which has been quoted in thePress.     The salient points are that the Company hasthis year for the first time for many years been unable to earn depreciation on it? old ships.     Itis the practice to finance the construction of a shiplike the new express steamer by making use of billmarket finance and repaying these liabilities out ofthe earnings set aside annually to coyer the normaldepreciation of the fleet, and partly out of the earnings o$ the ship herself during the first few yearsof her operation.     The Company&apos;s statement points outthat the international crisis has changed the wholefinancial background and made continued use of this type of finance less easy than formerly.
c$ 9C* tfc kjThe consequences of the suspension of buildingwere realised, but the enquiries made showed clearly that no stone had been left unturned by those concernedin the effort to avoid suspending the work on thissteamer.The question of direct Government assistance was not raised, and if it had been raised, it would nothave been possible to give financial assistance.The Gunard Company is building this ship out ofits own resources, and the only assistance asked for from the Government was in respect of insurance, andthis was given, with the approval of Parliament? &quot;by the cunard Insurance Agreement Act, 1930.As the schedule to that Act shows, the company were unwilling to order the building of the vesseluntil satisfied that they would be able to obtain and maintain sufficient insurances against constructionrisks and ordinary marine risks on reasonable terms.They therefore asked the Board of Trade to agree toprovide Insurance for such part of the value of the vessel as the Company might from time to time be unableto insure in the open market on reasonable terms.     Theconstruction risk on the vessel was placed some time ago,  2,720,000 being taken up by the market and 1,780,000 by the Board of Trade.The suspension of work on this vessel is very muchregretted, but I am afraid that any idea of direct government financial assistance is out of the question,and we can only hope that circumstance will permit thebuilding to be resumed before long.I would add that all Bills of Exchange current onthe ship will be paid off as they mature out of theCompany&apos;s liquid cash resources, which are ample for thepurpose.
