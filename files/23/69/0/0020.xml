TEE DISARMAMENTCONFERENCE.(previous reference:Cabinet 90(31), Con-clusion 4.)&apos;a.2. In resuming consideration of the question ofthe Disarmament Conference, the Cabinet had ontheir Agenda Paper the following documents:-An Interim Report by the CabinetCommittee (CP.-322 (31)):An Aspect of International relations in 1931 - a Memorandum by Sir robert vansittart, and The Foreign Policyof His Majestyfs Government in theUnited Kingdom (C.P.-317 (31)):Changing Conditions in british foreign Policy,   A Memorandum bythe Foreign Office (CP.-301 (31)):The Three-Party Resolutions (C,P.-277(31))1The French Memorandum on Disarmament(CP.-236 (3D):A Memorandum by the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee on the French Memorandumon Disarmament (CP,-213 (31)).The discussion was continued on the suggestion made by the Prime Minister the same morning, thatthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should prepare a Memorandum of the British position inrelation to European policy, as a draft for cons id-era tion by the Cabinet.A. discussion of a preliminary and general character took place, in order to provide some indication to the Secretary of State of the mind of the Cabinet on the questions raised in theCabinet Committee&apos;s Interim Report (CP.-322 (31)).Subsequently some discussion took place as to theprocedure of the Disarmament Conference, whichrevealed a strong desire that every effort shouldbe made beforehand,  if possible   to avert the raising,in the early stages of the Conference,  in sharpantithesis ,of the respective attitudes of the Frenchand German Governments.
The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the United Kingdom delegation at the Disarmament Conference musthave clear instructions before theyproceed to Geneva as to what linethey are to adopt if and when themain controversy between the Germanand French positions comes to a head:(b) That, as a first step towards decidingthis question, the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, in consultationwith members of the Cabinet Committeeto such extent as he may find convenientshould prepare for the consideration ofthe Cabinet a Memorandum, on the british position in relation to European policy.For the purpose of his draft he mightassume that the trend of Cabinetopinion on the questions raised in para ,7 of CP.-522 (31) is as follows&quot;:-(i) As regards question (2), theCabinet are. not prepared toenter into some form of guaranteeover and above Locarno underwhich, in conceivable circum-rstances, British forces mightbe engaged in a war on theContinent of Europe, even inrespect of the Eastern frontier of Germany (See Note below) ..(li) As regards question (4), theidea of the creation of someinternational force does not commend itself to the Cabinet.(iii) As regards  question (3), a&quot;Mediterranean Locarno&quot;, thegeneral idea is worth exploring,but opinion was reserved onthe question of accepting any commitment.    In any event,however, the commitment wouldhave to be safeguarded by pro-vision for arbitration as anessential stage before it could take effect.(iv) As regards question (l), namely,the attitude to be adopted inthe main controversy which is bound to arise between theGerman and the French positions,it should be borne in mind, onthe one hand, that Germany has.a strong moral backing for herclaim to the principle of equalitybut,  on the other hand, that itis necessary to avoid a decisionon that claim of such a character as would outrage French publicopinion.   The solution must lie
between these two positionsReparations and war Debts.(c)(previous reference:Cabinet 87(31), Con-    WV-elusion 9.)(NOTE: The Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, while willingto accept the above assumptions,from, which he did not dissent,as the basis for his Memo-randum, so far as they went,warned the Cabinet that sooner&apos;or latex- he might be compelledto consult them again as tothe answer to question (2),namely, as to whether anyfurther form of guarantee toFrance was possible.    He also indicated that he might find it necessary to consult thePrime Minis ter.)That the Chancellor of the exchequer should follow up indications he hadreceived of French willingness to gorather far in rendering us financialassistance if they could get a aottlOr-m^^^r^&amp;^^s^&amp;^^Sf^  in order that theCabinet might be cognizant of this aspect of the international situationwhen they have before them the Memo-randtim by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs;That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should, through the appropriatechannel,  indicate to foreign governments that His MarjestyTs Government in theUnited Kingdom were assuming that theConference would meet, as arranged, onFebruary 2    1932, and favoured adherence to this date.    He should then sound them as to the procedure to be adopted inthe opening phases of the Conference,which was a matter of importance sinceseveral Cabinet Ministers proposed toattend.   He should indicate the viewof His Majesty&apos;s Government to be thatthe Disarmament Conference should be opened with a series of speeches designedto give an uplift to the cause of disarmament, without raising, contentiousor provocative issues, and thus tocreate a favourable atmosphere throughoutthe world, in which the Conference could continue its work of detail.    This first. stage should, in the opinion of his majesty&apos;s .jesty&apos;s Government   be followedimmediately by Committees .    If the replies are favourable to this procedureit was suggested that the good offices of the Secretary-General of the Leagueof Nations might be invoked:.    That(e) ^immediately after the Christmas Recessthe Cabinet should meet again to continue their discussions on the basis of(1) the Secretary of State&apos;s Memorandum12) any information that the Chancellor&apos;.   of the Exchequer could give them
as to the French attitude, and(3) the reaction of foreign government to the above proposas to procedure.? ^ *Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,December 15, 19 31.
