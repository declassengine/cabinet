1. The Cabinet resumed the discussion ofGovernment Policy at the Indian Round Table Confer-ence.In this connection they had before them a most secret Memorandum by the Secretary of State forIndia (C.P.-285 (31)) on the subject of the North-West Frontier Province Constitution.The Cabinet were informed that the work of theIndian Round-Table Conference had taken longer thananticipated and that the Conference would not, as previously expected, terminate during the week beginning November 22nd, but during the following week beginning November 29th.    In these circum-stances the Prime Minister did not submit to theCabinet at this Meeting the statement he intendedto deliver at the close of the Conference.The Cabinet then discussed once more, In thelight of the various ctirrents of opinion in theIndian Round-Table Conference and of the Parliament-ary situation in this country, the question of which of the following courses was better:-(i) While adhering to an All-IndiaFederation as the aim of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, to intro-duce &quot;during the present Sessionof Parliament a provincial autonomy Bill:(ii) To postpone/provincial autonomyuntil the full scheme of anAll-India Federation and provincial autonomy could becompleted   involving a delay of eighteen months or two years:(ait) To invite the Indian Round-table conference to express an opinon as to whether (i) or (ii) was. preferred.After the above question had been discussed and decisions taken (see, below) the Prime Minista?gave the Cabinet an account of an interview which he
and the Lord President of the Council had had, late on the previous  evening, with a deputation fromthe Conservative Party&apos;s India Committee.After a comprehensive discussion of the wholequestion the Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve generally the policy whichhad been adopted at the Cabinet Meet-ing referred to in the margin:(b) That, in his statement at the termin-ation of the Indian Round-table conference, the Prime Minister should,inter alia, repeat the substance ofthe declaration he had made at the endof the First Session of the Round-table conference on January 19, 1931, as tothe intentions of the Government(Cmd.3772, pp.80-83).   He should also make clear that.as an earnest of their good faith, His Majesty&apos;s government intend to introduce legislationproviding for provincial automonyduring the present Session of Parlia-ment, and that the work necessary tocomplete an All-India Federal Consti-tution will be i*w^^**^e4 at. once bythe despatch of appropriate committees to India.   He should refer to thennrmTvmaJ.. qjigja&amp;jon on the lines of&quot;Conclusion ( c) below)    - He should include a statement as to theConstitution of the Worth-west frontier Province as a Governor&apos;sProvince (See Conclusion (d) below) .He should &quot;also inform the conference that both Houses of Parliament willbe asked immediately to endorse his statement.(c) The Prime Minister should make clearthat. His Majesty * s Government in theUnited Kingdom could not allow theProvincial Autonomy Bill to be upsetby the absence of a Communal settlement in India.    If the various sections inIndia had not been able to reach agree-ment among themselves by a date early.in&apos; the New Year to be specified,the Governmentwould themselves have to take certaindecisions     as the basis of their Bill,and in doing so they would adhere as closely as possible to the status quo.The position, however, would be left in such form that if agreement were reached subsequently in India areadjustment could be made.
