-nflE ABNORMALTfffORTAT IONS(CUSTOMSDUTIES)  BILL,(previous reference:Cabinet 77(31), Oon-clusion 3.)ft.13.The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (CP .-283 (31))circulating for the information of his colleagues acopy of the Abnormal Importations (Customs Duties)Bill in the form in which it will be introduced inthe House of Commons .The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to clause.se 2(2), as follows:-&quot;No articles which are Empire productswithin the meaning of that expressionas used in sub-section (l) of sectioneight of the Finance Act, 1919, shallbe chargeable with duty under this Act %,which, it was pointed out, differed from the followingConclusion of the Cabinet:-&quot;That, as regards the Dominions, power will be taken in the Bill for the Boardof trade to exempt goods from the wholeor part of the duty, provided they aremanufactured within the Empire&quot; (Cabinet76 (31). Conclusion 1 (e)),The Cabinet were informed that the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade,to whom the Cabinet had, at the Meeting referred toin the margin, left the approval of the Bill, had had several drafts of this Clause before them.   As theMinisters had been satisfied that no case of abnormalimportations from the Dominions had arisen or was likely to arise in the class of imports with which theBill deals, and more particularly as the canadian government had recently varied their anti-dumpinglegislation to meet our requirements, it had been thought advisable: to vary the Cabinet decision, whichhad the additional advantage of simplifying the Bill.The Cabinet also took note of the abovealteration in their previous decision.
DGES&apos;Variesf previous reference:Cabinet 75(31), Con-elusion 7.)14. The Prime Minister drew attention to a letter which had appeared in the &quot;Times&quot; newspaper of theprevious day on the. subject of Judges&apos; Salaries.The Secretary of State for War agreed with thePrime Minister that at the present moment more harm than good might be done by carrying out the decisionof the Cabinet referred to in the margin, accordingto which the Prime Minister was to send a letterinviting the Judges themselves to consider whetherthey would be willing to propose a reduction in theiremoluments.   He added that the preparation of theletter, which had been remitted to the Lord chancellor and himself, had been delayed owing to the continuouspreoccupation of the Lord Chancellor with the indian round-mabIe Conference and other official duties.The Cabinet felt that, in the light of freshinformation before them, their previous decisionrequired re-consideration, and left the matter to thePrime Minister in consultation with the Lord chancellor and the Secretary of State for War.
15*    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum(Paper C.P. 280 (j)&quot;!)) prepared by the Ministerof Transport in response to their request (at themeeting referred to in the margin) for &quot;any existing papers containing an explanation of theBill and the reasons for its urgency, togetherwith a Memorandum setting forth the effect of amendments which it was now proposed to make tothe Bill&quot;.It was argued in the Memorandum that,speaking generally, informed opinion was agreedthat a measure of co-ordination of London passenger transport was urgently required and that some formof fusion of the various existing systems was theonly solution.     Among the consequences of a failure to face the position would be the continuanceof excessive profits in the case of a limited number of independent omnibus proprietors(or alternatively an acute demand for thereduction of fares all round)j    the abandonment of suburban electrification in the north and east of London (or alternatively an Exchequer contribu-tion towards its cost)-    and the stagnation oftube development (or alternatively further subsidies for new construction).     The mere substitution of another scheme for that contained in the Bill might give rise to difficulties not l^ss than.those withwhich the Government were now fac^d.The opposition of the London County Counciland Metropolitan Railway should not be allowed toobscure the fact that complete agreement had beenreached with the great majority of the interests
concerned, namely, the Underground Group, all of thefifteen tramway-owning local authorities concerned(except the London County Council),  the four main railwaycompanies concerned, provincial omnibus companies,trade unions, manufacturers, and gas, water and electricity undertakings.The Memorandum gave reasons to show that theclaim of the Metropolitan Railway to be treated as amain line company was untenable (pages 6 and j and appendix A).The concluding part of the Memorandum (tqgetherwith Appendix B) dealt with amendments to the Bill putdown with a view to securing alterations in theconstitution of the proposed Transport Board.     Inparticular,^objection was tak^n fe^r e^^Ma i&amp;4e*e&amp;4s tothe appointment of the Board by the Minister andthe memorandum developed a modus vivendi which, itwas thought, might go some way to meet thoseobjections.      The Minister proposed to continue discussions with the interests affected, and suggested that notice of motion to revive the Billshould be deferred for the present.Appendix C showed the principal amendmentsmade by the Joint Select Committee to meet criticismsmade on Second Reading.
After discussing the matter with the Ministercf Transport the Cabinet agreed -(a) That the Minister of Transport shouldbe authorised to proceed -on&quot; the lines of theexisting London Passenger transport bill, subject to such amendments as might be required as the result ofhis discussions with&apos; the interests affected:(b) That the Transport Board should not include representatives of sectionalinterests:(c) That, subject to the principle setforth in (b), the Minister of transport should have authority to conduct his conversations on the basis of his proposal (ii) on page 9 of his Memo-randum (C.P.-280 (31)), viz:-(ii) That the duty of appointing theBoard and filling vacancies shouldbe vested   not in the Minister ofTransport after consultation withthe Treasury, &apos;   &apos;       as proposed,but in a small selection boardconsisting of persons holdingoffice ex. offfcip.    Such a board might, for example, consist of theMinister of Transport as Chairman,the Chairman for the time being of the London Traffic AdvisoryCommittee (a body consistingpredominantly of representativesof local authorities in the Londontraffic area) and one or possibly three outside and independentoccupants of positions ofresponsibility of a permanentcharacter.    It would be undesirable to enlarge the body of selectionin such a way as to make it appearto be or function as a collectionof representatives of interestsand weaken the!: sense of responsi-bility .(d) That the Minister should have full discre-tion, if he found it advisable in orderto secure the passage of the Bill, to drop the proposal that the Minister ofTransport should be represented on theBoard.(e) To take note that the Minister of Transportintended to re-examine the question of whether it was possible to surmount thedifficulties arising in connection withthe Metropolitan Railway Company bytreating that Company as though it were a Main Line Railway .s But see Conclusion(d) below.
THE ottawa conference,(previous reference:Cabinet 75(31)    contribute-elusion 4.)16,     The Cabinet agreed -That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the Secretary of State forthe Colonies should be added as membersof the Cabinet Committee on the proposedImperial Economic Conference at Ottawa.The membership of the Committee would therefore be as follows:-The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The Secretary of State for the Colonies,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries
(previous reference:Cabinet 41(27), Con-clusxon 5.)17.   The Secretary of State for the colonies informed the Cabinet that, in his view, any decisions as to the future Constitution of Cyprus must be deferred until the agitation had died down both inthe island and in Greece.   He had. sent to theGovernor a telegram to this effect, which had been repeated to the British Minister at Athens .    TheSecretary of State also informed his colleagues ofa conversation he had had with the Archbishop of canterbury on the subject of the recent troublesin Cyprus.   The Archbishop, who had been approached by the Greek Bishops, intended to reply by lettermaking clear that he could not interfere in any way with the action taken by the Government to deal withcriminal proceedings by the Bishops.
