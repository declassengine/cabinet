cabinetproceedings.Secrecy of.(previous reference:Cabinet 75(31),  Con-clusion 3,)a.1. Referring to his remarks at the meeting mentioned in the margin on the subject of the secrecy of Cabinet proceedings, the Prime Minister drew attention to an announcement in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;of the same morning that the Cabinet had definitelydecided on the previous evening to introduce a bill dealing with &quot;dumping&quot;.   Although inaccurate in some important matters of detail, there were passages inthe paragraph which corresponded rather closely to  1what had occurred at the Cabinet.
pR INDIAN mfD-TABLEHFERENCE.overnrnentolicy at.previous reference:Cabinet 76(31), Oon-clusion 2.)41) \2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion ofGovernment Policy at the Indian Round-0able Confer-ence, on the basis of the Note by the Secretary ofState for India covering a Memorandum explaining the present situation at the Round-Table Conference(CP .-272 (51)), and the Recommendations of the   ,Cabinet Committee on India (CP.-273 (31)), a summaryof which is attached in the Appendix.The Cabinet did not dissent from the recommenda-tion contained in the Report of the Cabinet Committeethat the Indian Round-Table Conference should bebrought to an  end at an early date (Conclusion (a).Appendix).   nor from the suggested promise tointroduce a Bill to provide provincial autonomy(conclusion (p), Appendix) with some clear indication,perhaps in the preamble to the Bill and certainly inthe Prime Minister&apos;s closing statement to the Confer-ence, to the effect that the aim of the Governmentwas an All-India Federation.    The plan, -however, of inviting both Houses of Parliament early in the NewYear to register their formal acceptance of thepolio;/ by means of Resolutions (Conclusions (b) and(d) ^ Appendix) t did not commend itself to the Cabinet .It was felt that it would be dangerous to promise to introduce such Resolutions unless and until theCabinet had approved them, at least in a rough form.Otherwise there was a risk that the Government mightbe committing themselves to a pledge which they mightnot be able to implement.    It was pointed out thatthe Resolutions wrould necessarily have to be drawn3-n very general terms.   Their tenor might easily be altered by amendments carried, if not in the Houseof Commons, at any rate in the&apos;House of Lords.,
If they emerged from Parliament in a different formfrom what had heen promised at the Round-table conference, the effect in India might be deplorable.It was further pointed out that uncertainty wouldexist as to whether the Resolutions could be imple-mented until some of the outstanding difficultiesin the way of All-India Federation had been cleared up, such as those relating to the Princes andc ommuna1 agr eerne nt.In the course of the discussion summarised above, the Prime Minister, in response to an urgentmessage, left the Cabinet for a few minutes.   after his return he read the following statement on thesubject of communal agreement, which had been signed by Mr Gandhi:-&quot;I recognise the difficulties inthe way of a definitive settlement ofthe communal question at this stage.I am therefore prepared to accepta temporary and provisional arrange-ment of the communal question.    Ibelieve the most practicable coursewill be, as a temporary measure, toleave this question more or less onthe basis on which it has been dealtwith in the existing Constitutionuntil some agreed settlement has beenreached.If the Prime Minister will announceas the Government policy that the coinmunalquestion be thus left on the existingConstitutional basis as a temporary measurepending an agreed settlement I shall welcome such an announcement and give it my siipport.
There was general agreement that Mr. Gandhi&apos;acceptance of a provisional arrangement of the communal question had altered the situation consider-ably, and that it might now be necessary to have further meetings of the Federal Structure Committee,which, as the Lord Chancellor in a detailed statement had already informed the Cabinet, hadbeen held up by the failure to reach communalagreement.      In these circumstances the Round-table conference was not likely to end on Wednesday next,and the Prime Minister&apos;s statement could probablybe delayed for at least a week.In the light of these changed circumstances theReport of the Cabinet Committee was resumed.      TheCabinet were reminded that up to the present timeneither the Government itself nor the ConservativeDelegates at the Indian Round Table Conference had committed themselves to produce a scheme of Federationat the centre.-     They had, last January,  favouredFederation as the most hopeful solution, and had promised to do their best to bring it about, subjectto the practicability of evolving a workable system with adequate safeguards.      Since January, however,not much progress had been made towards the evolution of an all-India Federal constitution.      Some of theessential elements were still lacking, such as thepoints referred to earlier in this Minute, namely,agreement among the Princes and communal agreement.      Inthese circumstances it was urged that it would be a mistake for the Government to go as far as to pledgeitself to produce an all-India Federal Bill.      TheSecretary of State for India suggested that the needs ofthe situation would be met if we could make clear,beyond possibility of doubt, our good-will, our
intention, to overcome the difficulties in the wayof an all-India Federation, and our belief that,although the task had not been rendered easier bythe events of the present year,  the obstacles werenot insurmountable,      The Gabinet generally accepted this latter view.While the proposal to move Resolutions in both Houses of Parliament was discarded, it was feltthat some striking official action was essentialto signalise the genuine intention of the Governmentto proceed, if possible, with their policy of anall-India Federation, and to bring home to the delegates at the Round-Table Conference and to public opinion in India a conviction of the Govern-ment&apos;s bona fides in the matter.     This intentionmight be thrown into proper relief in the PrimeMinister&apos;s statement at the close of the Round-table conference, and the Secretary of State for Indiasuggested that this statement should then be printedand circulated as a White Paper to Parliament, whowould be asked to debate it and to endorse it atthe earliest possible moment after (and, if possible,on the day following)  the close of the Conference.This proposal at once commended itself to the Cabinet.It was further suggested that the Prime Minister&apos;;:statement, while intimating that the Governmentpledged themselves to work for Federation, should leave no doubt that it was a special kind of Federa-tion, and that if Indians themselves rendered itimpossible of accomplishment the responsibility wouldbe theirs and the Government of the United kingdom would consider that it had fulfilled its obligations.
The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the following variations shouldbe made in the policy proposed by theCabinet Committee in CP.-273 (31):-(i) That no undertaking should begiven to introduce an All-IndiaFederation Bill, but that theGovernment should make clearthat an All-India Federation isthe aim of their policy and thatthey will do their utmost to overcome the difficulties    ejwtU^u,vw4 ^(ii) That no undertaking should be given at the Indian Round-^atle conference to introduce Resolutions early inthe New Year for formal acceptance by both Houses of Parliament.Instead, the Government&apos;s policy should be announced by the PrimeMinister in a statement to be madeat the conclusion of the Conference.This statement should be printedand circulated as a White paper to Parliament, who would be askedto debate it and to endorse it atthe earliest possible moment after(and,  if possible, on the dayfollowing) the close of the Confer-ence.(b) That the Prime Minister should prepare a, draft of his statement, based generally on the Report of the Cabinet Committee(CP.-273 (31)), modified as the resultof this Cabinet Meeting,  for considera-tion by the Cabinet at ra Special meeting to be held in the Prime Minister&apos;s room at the House of Commons on Friday next,November 9D, 19 31, at 11 a.m,(c) That the Meeting of the Committee ofImperial Defence arranged for that day should be postponed.

The attention of the Cabinet was called as amatter of urgency to the strong feeling that hadmanifested itself during the Debate on the Addressamong Members for agricultural constituencies infavour of some Government support, to agriculture,and to the strong probability, as indicated by thepress that morning, that, when the introduction ofthe-Abnormal Importation (Custone Duties) Bill was announced., there would be a demand for the inclusiontherein of some forms of agricultural produce, and,at any rate, of canned fruits,  -vegetables and milk.Such demand, it was pointed out, would be strengthened by the fact that, within the first ten days of the.present month, the value of importations of cannedor bottled fruit amounted to  10,730compared with  14,252 for the whole of October. Theseimportations competed with, and, on this scale,would be a menace to a new and promising Britishindustry.      In addition, imports of canned milkcompeted seriously with the British milk industry.It was suggested that the inclusion in the Bill ofagricultural products such as those mentioned abowewould assist the passage of the Bill through parliament, but that it was unlikely that it wouldbe necessary to exercise the powers since foreign nations would at once become aware that excessiveimportations on their part would be liable to bemet by a tariff and would probably refrain fromrunning the   risk of provoking this.The Cabinet were reminded, however, that the abnormal Importations (CustomsDuties; Bill was in essence a &quot;forestalling&quot; measure.      In the many
perishable articles of agricultural produce forestallingwas impossible, and the Bill was inapplicable to suchwascases.      The Bill/ essentially an emergency measure todeal with a temporary situation, t..nd was to belimited in its application to goods falling withinClass 3 (i.e., manufactured and mainly manufactured articles) which were being imported in abnormalquantities.     The inclusion within the scope ofthe Bill of canned fruits, vegetables and milk would to some extent prejudice the fiscal issue, and would expose it to the criticism, so potent in the past,that it would raise the cost of the food of thepeople..     The proposal, it was suggested, raisedlarge and controversial questions of policy whichthe Cabinet had not yet considered.In these circumstances it was suggested that,   v;the immediate situation could be met by anannouncement that importations of agricultural produce would be carefully watched,, and, if necessaryfurther powers would be asked for.     An announcement . .of this nature, it was felt, would be more readily -   .accepted if the Abnormal Importations (CustomsDuties) Bill was limited to six months, instead of twelve.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That, unless the President of theBoard of Trade (who was unable toattend this meeting of the Cabinet)felt strong objection, the abnormal Importations (CustomsDuties) Bill should be limited to six months instead of twelve ;(b) That the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries should see the Presidentof the Board of Trade and discuss withhim the explanation to be given to theHouse of Commons as to why agricultural produce was not included in the Bill,.-.rb-itehall Gardens,^ November, 1 951.
