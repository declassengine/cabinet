ST FRLINGVALUES ,(previous reference:Cabinet 87(31), Con-clusion 7.)2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer appealed tohis colleagues to exercise great care in avoiding any public statement which could be interpreted as a hint that we contemplated the stabilisation of the   Sterling at any particular value, as therewas great nervousness on the subject, particularlyabroad.-2-
.1*       the ABNORMAL 3.    The President of the Board of Trade, inTfvfpORTATIONSft (CUSTOMS DUTIES) reply to a question,  informed the Cabinet that a&quot;act.further Order was to be issued on the following dayOrders underunder the Abnormal Importations (Customs Duties)(Previous Act.   This Order was required to fill up certain reference:Cabinet 79 gaps .   He was prepared to circulate copies to the(31), Con-elusion 13.)       Cabinet that evening, if desired.A brief discussion took place in which thedesirability was questioned of circulating such orders so widely.   They were compared to theChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s Budget Statement,which was only made to the Cabinet at the lastpossible moment in order to avoid all risk ofdisclosure of taxation proposals.    There was generalagreement, however, that in the present international situation it was desirable that the Foreign office should be consulted on such Orders.The Cabinet agreed -That Orders under the AbnormalImportations  (Customs Duties) Actshould not be circulated in advance to the Cabinet, provided that theTreasury,       Board of Customs and excise&apos; and Foreign&apos; Office were consulted.
if.    The Cabinet had before them the Report (CP.  522(31))of the Cabinet Committee appointed at the Meeting referredto in the margin to undertake the supervision of theremaining work of preparation for the Disarmament Conference.and prepare instructions for the United Kingdom Delegationfor the approval of the Cabinet.    After setting forth an appreciation of the elements in the political problem in-volved, together with a forecast of the case that will be stated by France and Germany respectively at the Disarma-ment Conference and of the attitude of other European Powers.the Committee asked that the Cabinet as a whole should consider the following questions:-(1 ) In the main controversy which is bound to arise between the German and French positions, whatis to be the British attitude?(2) What is the British answer to the French claim for security?   Are we prepared to pay the price whichmay be the only means of bringing about a reductionin French armaments;    e,g., some form of guaranteeever and above Locarno?(3) Is the idea worth pursuing of a &quot;MediterraneanLocarno&quot;?(A) A further alternative prQposal, of a somewhatshadowy kind, namely,  the creation of aninternational force?Discussion was confined mainly to the first of theabove questions.The Cabinet were asked to remember that, as the result of earlier disarmament conferences the Navy has been diminished,to a point beyond which further reduction would be dangerous.There was general agreement that the mere recital ofthe contribution.we had already made to Disarmament wouldnot be of assistance in dealing with this question:    alsothat reductions of all armaments must be made on aninternational relational basis.One suggestion was that before the Disarmament Confer-ence we should place ourselves in communication, first with the French Government and afterwards with theGerman Government, with a view to averting as faras possible the raising,  in its sharpest form,
of the issue between the French and German thesesas set forth In the Report of the Cabinet CommitteeAnother suggestion was that as the DisarmamentConference, according to some good judges, was likely to last a very long time, it would be inadvisable at the outset for us to take any activeInitiative, and that this should be borne in mindin any conversations with the French and german governments.    Further, that in   such conversationsit was most important for us to avoid committing ourselves on one side or the other.The Prime Minister suggested, for the consider-ation of his colleagues, that it might be advisable for the Government, before entering a series of conferences for the purpose of establishingEuropean relationships on a new basis, to prepare a Memorandum of the British position in relation to european policy, in which would be Indicated thepoints on which we lay emphasis:    for example, itmight contain an indication of what we meant by&quot;security&quot;.    At present that term was usually takenin Europe to connote the French idea of security.At the Three-Party Committee Mr Lloyd George, he recalled, had pressed the idea that security meant that Germany had as good a right as France to be safe against invasion.    If that plan commendeditself, the first need would be the preparation ofa trial Memorandum for consideration by the cabinet when approved, the Memorandum might be sent to theLeague of Nations, and communicated in addition tothe nations principally concerned,   This was theplan adopted in the case of the French Memorandumof July 15th, which was published in the newspapersof July 18th (CP.-236 (31)). But he would like toconsider the procedure further.-5-
At this point the Cabinet adjourned, as several members had undertaken to attend the Service at st.. PaulTs Cathedral in connection with the forthcomingDisarmament Conference.    It was arranged to meet again the same afternoon at 2-SO p.m., at No .10,Downing Street.*  r  t2, Whitehall Gardens. S.W.1December 15, 1931.
