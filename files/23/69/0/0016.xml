1 ^A kiREPARATIONS,2. The Cabinet had a brief discussion on theThe forthcoming subject of the forthcoming Conference on Repara-Conference.tions, and agreed  (previous reference:Cabinet 80(31), Con-elusion 2.)(a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should be askedto take up steadily and continu-ously the question of the arrange-ments for the forthcoming Conferenceon Reparations which is to follow the meeting of the Young committee at&apos;Basle.   As to the place of theConference, the Cabinet inclined to the selection of mhe Hague,which, as experience at earlierConferences had shown, was notonly centrally situated for thePowers concerned in Reparationsbut had also provided a favourableatmosphere.    The Hagtie was suggested for the reason that London was understood not to meet the viewsof the French Government, but theForeign Secretary was asked tobear in mind that a meeting ofthe Conference here would be welcomed by Ris MajestyTs Govern-merit if, as the result of hissoundings of the other Governmentsconcerned, this should be foundacceptable.    In connection withthe selection of the place of theConference the Secretary of state was asked to bear in mind the greatimportance of an impartial Chairmanfor the Conference-That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should accept asuggestion of the French Government,which he had received on the previous evening through the French Ambassador(and which the Chancellor of theExchequer had received less formallyin a message from M. Pl-andin) that sir Frederick Leith-Ross should visit Paris to discuss generallyquestions such as reparations, thegeneral monetary situation,French balances in London.Cabinet fe?lt that at the presenttime it would be advisable for them not to lay down any instructions for sir Frederick Leith-Ross, but toleave the course of the conversationsto his discretion, on the understandingthat he would ask for instructions if .any difficult point arose:(c) That it was generally desirable toestablish close contact with the FrenchGovernment in view of the forthcomingConferences on Reparations and disarmament and

The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs mentioned that he had been in communication with lord Cecil, who foreshadowed the probability ofan agreement being reached the same day by theCouncil of the League on the Manchurian dispute.The main point of difficulty had been the neutral zone.    It had   , proved impossible to fix the zone in Paris at so great a distance from the scene of operations.    It was hoped, however, if no untowardincident occurred on the spot, that the Leaguewould pass a Resolution, the lines of which he explained to the Cabinet.   The Resolution would be accompanied by a covering Statement to be made byM. Briand as President of the Council of the League.He hoped that M. Briand would be willing to expressdisappointment at the result of the League&apos;s efforts in the matter, as it would be a mistake to maketinjustified claims of success..   In any event noindividual declaration would be made on behalf ofthis country.   His main apprehension at the presenttime was lest the Japanese, who had obviously beenpursuing a plan, should make a dash for Chinchow.Recent events at Tientsin had been suggestive.

The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs informed the Cabinet that he and the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries had met a Deputation fromthe National Federation of Corn Trade Associations,on which the Milling trade was represented, and discussed with them the Home and Dominion Wheat Quotas.In spite of announcements that had appeared in thePress,  the Deputation did not adopt a hostile attitude and had decided to co-operate by appointing aCommittee.The Deputation had explained that therehad not been time to withdraw the statement of hostility to the Wheat Quota advertised in the Press of thatdate by the National Association of British and IrishMillers./In reply to the President of the Board of Trade,the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said that representatives of the Liverpool &quot;Hedging&quot; market would, he understood, be included in the Committee tobe&apos; appointed by the National Federation./ NOTE:    Subsequently the National Association declined to withdraw from their previous attitude.

*1 i &apos;&quot;HCABINET POLICY 7. The Cabinet had before them a Most secret and WORK. , ,    viMemorandum by the Prime Minister (CP.-311 (31))(Previous entitled &quot;Cabinet Policy and Work&quot;.    In this reference:Cabinet 86 the Prime Minister pointed out that during the next(31),  Con-clusion 2.)       two months the Cabinet must try and devise a widef7- ft- and co-ordinated policy on the issues upon whichthe Election was fought, and must see that thevarious Departments concerned are working withknowledge and in harmony.   He dealt with the main problems to be faced under the following heads:-(a) Currency Policy.(b) British Policy regarding inter-national Financial Operations .to) Fiscal Policy.(d) Economy and Taxation.He then raised the question as to how the examina-tion of these questions was to be conducted, and made suggestions under each head.    As most of thesematters were very urgent he asked that cabinet ministers who were able to leave London should leave a note of their whereabouts and, if possible,their telephone numbers,   He pointed out that thelegislative programme of the session was another matter requiring attention.The Cabinet discussed the Memorandumparagraph by paragraph,Composition of the Bank of England Directorate.The Cabinet were reminded of the widespreadcriticisms of the composition of the Bank of EnglandDirectorate.     It was felt that this was a matter which the Government could not ignore.   These
9 i o - -criticisms, as it appeared from the discussion,took two forms;    (1)  the desire of industrialiststo be represented on the Court of the Bank ofEngland, and (2) the belief that the Governmentwas not in sufficiently close touch with the Bank.In this latter connection the Cabinet were assured by the present Chancellor of the Exchequer andhis predecessors that the liaison between theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Governor of the 1Bank could hardly be made closer or more intimate.Among suggestions made in the course of thediscussion were the following:    that there should be some more visible sjnubol of the close connection between the Treasury and the Bank of England;    thata Committee might be established by the Chancellorof the Exchequer to advise him on currency questions,which might include, among others, representativesof industry and a representative of the foreign and India Office:Office/    that a Committee, including representativesof industry, might be established by the Bank ofEngland to enable the Court of the Bank to keep incloser touch with industry;    that a conventionmight be established that the Chancellor of theExchequer should be consulted before appointmentswere made to the Court of the Bank of England;    thatthe remuneration of Directors of the Bank ofEngland was inadequate as compared with that of directors of the Joint Stock Banks.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That representation of such bodiesas the Federation of British Industries,the National Confederation of Employers&apos;Organisations, and Chambers of Commerce,on the Court of the Bank of Englandwas undesirable,and that government control of the policy of the Bank ofEngland w^s also undesirable.
(b) That, subject to the above general view of the Cabinet,  the Chancellorof the Exchequer should discuss withthe Governor of the Bank of england the desirability of some development to meet criticisms directed againstthe composition of the Court;(c)That the Chancellor of the Exchequer,keeping in touch with the Presidentof the Board of Trade,  should advise the Gabinet of the results of had discussions with the Governor of theBank.Sterling Values.The Cabinet had a preliminary discussion onthe subject of the policy to be pursued by theGovernment as to the stabilisation of sterling;what should be the relation of sterling to gold:what principles govern the time when stabilisationshould take place&apos;, the possibility ofestablishing a block of nations whose financialsystem depended on sterling!    in a word, what wasthe answer to the question constantly put - &quot;Whatis the Government doing about the  ?&quot;.The Cabinet agreed  That the Chancellor of the exchequer should prepare a Memorandum on theabove subjects, which shouldbe referred for consideration bya Cabinet Committee composed asfollows:-The Chancellor of the Exchequer,(in the Chair),The Lord President of the Council,The Lord Privy Seal,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Health.(At this point, discussion of the Prime Minister&apos;sMemorandum was interrupted while the Cabinetdealt with a question of urgency),
8.    The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,as a matter of urgency, brought to the attentionof the Cabinet a message which had reached him from his principal Private Secretary, during themeeting.      It appeared that M.  de Flruriau, theFrench Ambassador, had called at the ForeignOffice that morning, and had expressed the belief that he might induce his Government to withdraw the-15 per cent, surtax (referred to at the meeting mentioned in the margin), so far as British coal was concerned, as coal was in a different categoryfrom the other articles to which the surtax applied.Before making this recommendation to his Government,however, His Excellency wished to know whether,if his proposal were adopted, the BritishGovernment would refrain from passing the legisla-tion contemplated by the Cabinet.      In making this communication, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs explained that, on the previous evening, he had handed to the French Ambassadora Note carrying out the Cabinet decision referredto in the margin.The Cabinet agreed:-That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should be authorisedto reply to the French Ambassador thathis Note applied to every item in theFrench schedule;    that it wasimpossible for him to say whether theabove proposal,  if presented officiallyby the French Government, would besufficient to deter ills Majesty&apos;sGovernment from the action they had contemplated.    Goal however, provided a very prominent example of the effectof the French surtax.      If the FrenchGovernment decided to remit the surtaxin the case of coal,  it would naturallyprove a mitigating factor.

After the preceding question had been dealt-with as a matter or urgency, the Cabinet returnedto the Prime minister&apos;s Memorandum (CP.-311 (31))Paragraph 4 (b) and Paragraph 6 (commenting on paragraph 4 (b)).After a discussion of a preliminary characterthe Cabinet agreed  (a) To take note that the Chancellorof the Exchequer was about to circulate to them a Memorandumbearing on the question ofexchanging views with the UnitedStates of America on the subjectof International FinancialOperations (Reparations, War Debts,etc.):(b) That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows t-The Chancellor of the Exchequer(In the Chair),The Secretary of State forForeign Affairs,The President of the Board of Trade,The Lord Privy Seal -should consider and report to the Cabinet on british policy regarding international financial Operations.
