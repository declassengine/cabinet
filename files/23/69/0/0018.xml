S. The. Cabinet had before them a Memorandum&quot;bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP.-318(31)) on the subject of informal conversations which had taken place between representatives ofthe Dutch and British Colonial Offices and dutch and British rubber producers on the question of rubber.    At these conferences it had been unani-mously agreed that the only   plan   which would be practicable and acceptable would be a quota scheme under which a basic tonnage would be fixed foreach producing country, and a production and exportquota allotted to each country.    Particulars of theproposed scheme were attached to the Memorandum.The Secretary of State asked the Cabinet toagree in principle to the adoption of a restrictionscheme which satisfied the conditions laid down inthe Memorandum, that is to say, that it is inter-national, comprehensive in the area covered,administratively practicable, and generally accept-able to the industry.   With that authority he proposed at once to endeavour to obtain theconcurrence of the Netherlands East Indies, throughthe Dutch Government, and of the Governments of malaya and Ceylon, to the scheme.    As soon as he knew that the . plan   was regarded as acceptableand practicable by these three Governments, he proposed, through the proper channels, to approach the Governments of other countries in the Par east which are responsible for a comparatively smallproduction but whom it is desirable to bring into any comprehens ive&apos; s oh erne ,While there was no criticism in principle of thedesirability of the adoption of an internationalscheme free from the objections which wrecked the
Stevenson scheme, there was some apprehension as.tothe effect of the above proposals in the UnitedStates of America, especially at the present moment when certain interested parties might be glad of anopportunity to criticise European countries inconnection with the question of Allied Debts.It was suggested to the Cabinet that, in orderto remove criticism in the United States of America,American users of rubber might be associated insome way with the international control:    forexample, if the control was carried out by Govern-ments, there might be an Advisory Committee onwhich the principal users, including Americans,might be represented. / J       JThe Cabinet were informed that, owing to the short notice at which the question had been placedon the Agenda Paper of the Cabinet, the Presidentof the Board of ^rade was not in a position to criticise the scheme in detail.The Cabinet agreed  That the discussion should be postponed until WEDNESDAY,DECEMBER 16th, in order to give time to the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and thePresident of the Board of Trade .to prepare a considered opinon as to how their Departments were affected by the proposal.

The Cabinet resumed consideration of thePrime Minister&apos;s Most Secret Memorandum entitled&quot;Cabinet Policy and Work&quot; (CP.-311 (31)), beginningat paragraph 4(d) - &quot;Economy and Taxation&quot;,The Cabinet agreed -That the Minister of Health andthe Minister of Labour, duringthe next few weeks, should keep a careful watch on the workingof the economies in WsB*r*efsrl Ukv&amp;t^ Li^-u^d&quot;S^*%fe Insurance, including &apos;the activities of the PublicAssistance Committees, and thaton the re-assembly of the cabinet after the Christmas Recess theyshould report on the positionand as to whether undue&apos; or avoidable hard-ship was involved in the application ofthe economies.C The Cabinet had a brief discussion on the .subject of the Government&apos;s building programme and whether its curtailment achieved real economy.They were reminded, for example, that the presenthousing of the Air Ministry, partly in Kingswayand partly in buildings scattered about London, wasuneconomical,   The Secretary of State for Air saidthat he had prepared a Memorandum on this question.The Cabinet were also reminded that the disposi-tion of the Government Offices on the WhitehallGardens site was also uneconomical.   Similarremarks were applied to the Government buildings in Edinburgh,       It was suggested also that the sites of some of the War Office barracks, e.g. atKnightsbridge, might be utilised more economically.The Cabinet were reminded that Army Barracks in,many parts of the country were long overdue for rebuilding,In connection with the above subject theChancellor of the Exchequer reminded the Cabinet
FXHe had had at his disposal a certain amount ofspecially devised Governmental machinery, e.g., aCommittee of Civil Servants, under the chairmanship of the Right Hon. Sir John /aiderson (Permanent Under-Secret ary, Home Office), and Sir- Horace Wilson(Chief Industrial Adviser to His Majesty&apos;s Government)The Ministers who had held the post of Lord privy seal had succeeded, by informal efforts,  in obtaining .some large orders for this country, and had stimu-lated activities of various kinds which were stillthat there was no money available for buildingschemes at the present time.The Cabinet agreed  That the First Commissioner ofWorks should prepare a Memorandumon the Government&apos;&apos; s building programme, and send it in thefirst instance to the Treasury,with a view to its subsequentcirculation to the Cabinet.Ipire 6. in connection with the discussions onIgratidh.Economy, and more particularly its UnemploymentpreviousReference: aspects, reference was made to Migration.Rabinet 86131), Con- The Cabinet were informed that at the presentlusion 9 .)time immigration into this country from thefit.qfiSjlf Dominions was actually exceeding emigration.   Itwas suggested that the subject was one which oughtto be considered seriously at the Ottawa. Conference.No decisions were taken, but the trend of opinion was that the prospects of emigration for some years were not hopeful, and that the Unemployment problemought to be considered on this assumption.o-ordination 7. The Cabinet were reminded that in the time Employment.of the Labour Government the Lord Privy Seal hadPrevi previous reference: undertaken to co-ordinate all employment policy.
providing a large amount of employment.   The cabinet were informed that unless further decisions were taken these activities would gradually diminishuntil they ceased altogether.   The suggestion wasmade that the Secretary to the Department of OverseasTrade was eminently suitable, both owing to his own position and to his personal experience, for stimu-lating orders to British industry.The Cabinet agreed  That a Committee    composed ofrepresentatives (e .g ., Parlia-mentary Under-^Secretaries orothers) nominated by thefollowing Ministers - The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for Scotland,The Minister of Health,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Labour,The Minister of Transport  should consider the machinery and organisation now used, e,g.,Unemployment Grants Committee, etc.,which are in process of termination,for providing work for the unemployed,and report what amendments in itshould be made or alternatives setup,    They should bear in mind thatthe number of persons for whom itis impossible to find permanent employment will probably remain ata very large figure, which is not likely to be reduced materially forsome years to come.    They should consider the work done by the lord privy Seal as employed by the lateLabour Cabinet for stimulating andco-ordinating efforts to create work.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thathe himself would be devoting attention to the sameproblem.
Education andEmployment.8.    Some discussion took place as to how farour educational system conduced to the productionof young men and women fitted to utilise suchopportunities as exist for employment.   A suggestion was made that the system tended to produce too manyapplicants for &quot;clean-collar&quot; posts and too fewto fill vacancies in industrial and manual employ-men t .The President of the Board of Education informed the Cabinet that he had received an interestingReport by a Committee on this subject, to which he proposed to allude in public in the near future.This problem was reserved for considerationafter the question referred to in the precedingConclusion had been dealt with by the Cabinet.Silver.(previous reference:Cabinet 16(31), Con-conclusion 16.)9. In connection with this discussion theCabinet were reminded of the importance of dealingwith the problem of Silver;   for example, with aview to improvement of the trade with China.It was suggested that the Rome Secretary should prepare a Memorandum on this subject.Proposed trade delegation toIndia.fx.10.
