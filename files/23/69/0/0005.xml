THE FINANCIALAND ECONOMICSITUATION.ExcessiveImportationsand &quot;Dumping&quot; ,(previous reference:Cabinet 74(51), Oon-clusion 3.)1, The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memo-randum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and thePresident of the Board of Trade (C.P.-S74 (.31))on the subject of importations with the object of forestalling ppssible Duties.   Examination of thefigures of imports into London and Harwich showed that the month of October revealed no very markeddifference as compared with October, 1930.   The.opening days of November, however, though theperiod is too short for final conclusions, appearto show a marked increase in the value of thegoods entering this country.   Particulars weregiven showing that the increase was rather generalThe conclusion drawn from these, figures by theauthors of the Memorandum was that the increaseof imports is sufficiently striking to meritserious attention, and might easily grow to muchmore alarming dimensions if not checked.    Sincethe House of Commons would be rising in the courseof a few weeks&apos; time they thought it desirablethat the Government should ask Parliament at theearliest possible moment to arm it with thenecessary powers to deal with abnormal importationas and when it occurs.    Suggestions were made asto the form that the powers should take.    It was further suggested that as the powers were requiredto deal with a temporary situation, the Act and orders made under it should expire at the end of twelve months from the passage of the Act./   Summarised in the Conclusions .-1-
The following points were mentioned in thecourse of the discussion:-Pigiires received since the circulation of theMemorandum (CP.-874 (31)) indicate that imports are increasing rapidly, particularly in certain types of machinery imported mainly from northern europe,   A considerable proportion of such import-ations is believed to be on consignment.British Shipping Interests report exceptionalactivity in imports during October, which still continues.   Importations, if continued at thepresent rate, will affect the balance of trade.and increase the strain on the exchanges .As any announcement of legislation might increase forestalling, it should be followed by legislation with the least possible delay.As stated in the Memorandum (CPT-S74 (31))the legislation will empower the Board of Trade,with the consent of the Treasury^ to impose theDuty if satisfied that goods of the kinds specified&quot;are, being, imported in abnormal quantities&quot;.In order to check excessive importations avery high Duty may be preferable.A period of twelve months for duration ofthe Bill is likely to prove less upsetting totraders than a shorter term.   The longer periodalso lessens the risk of the country being floodedwith further excessive imports of the same kind onthe expiration of the Bill.The Ministers mainly concerned are advised bytheir respective Departments that the method pro-posed for checking excessive imports can be appliedwithout infringing our Commercial Treaties .
5KOnce the Act is passed, no serious delayneed arise in making the Order.The case of the Dominions requires special consideration.    See. Conclusion (e) belowThe Bill will require a Money Resolution,but will not be a long one.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the proposal of theChancellor of the Exchequer and president of the Board of trade as set forth in their Memorandum(CP .-274 (31)) that &quot;the Govern-ment should ask Parliament at theearliest possible moment to arm it with the necessary powers to dealwith abnormal importation as andwhen it occurs&quot;.(b) That the Board of Trade should beempowered, with the consent of theTreasury^ to impose by Order a Dutynot exceeding 100 per cent, ad valoremon any kind of goods falling withinClass 3 (i.e., manufactured andmainly manufactured articles) ofthe Import List,  if satisfied thatgoods, of that kind are being importedin abnormal quantities.-(c) That the Order, though taking effect at once, will be subject to confirma-tion by Resolution cf the House ofCommons within four weeks if theHouse is sitting at the time thatthe Order is made, or within four weeks of its re-assembly if it isnot.    The Bill will contain a provi-sion enabling Orders to be varied or revoked, and it may be necessary toinclude machinery provisions dealingwith such matters as the basis of valuation.(d) That/these powers are being taken todeal with a temporary situation, theAct, and all Orders made under it,will expire at the end of twelvemonths from the passage of the Act.(e) That, as regards the Dominions, power will be taken in the Bill for the Boardof Trade to exempt goods from thewhole or part of the Duty, provided they are manufactured within theEmpir e.(f) That the President of the Board ofTrade should give instructions forthe immediate drafting of the Bill,as

The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to Government Policy at theIndian Round-Table Conference:-A Note by the Secretary of State forIndia (CP.-272 (31)) covering aMemorandum explaining the presentsituation at the Round-Table Con-rference;   showing the possible courses of action open to HisMajesty&apos;s Government;    and settingotit the heads of a suggestedGovernment Statement of Policy:A Note by the Secretary of State forIndia summarising the recommendationsof the Cabinet Committee on India(CP.-273 (31)) .The Cabinet agreed unanimously that itwould not be right to take a decision in the absenceof the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whohas exceptional experience and interest in thequestion of constitutional developments in India,and who had been obliged to leave the meeting to keepan important official engagement..As the Report of the Cabinet. Committee,(CP. 27J) (51)), had only been circulated a short time before the assembly of the Cabinet,  the PrimeMinister made a comprehensive statement on thepresent position, in the course of which he explained in detail the policy proposed in the Report..     TheSecretary of State for India supplemented thePrime Ministers statement.The Cabinet then adjourned until thefollowing day, when it was arranged to meet in thePRIME MINISTER&apos;S ROOM, HOUSE OF COMMONS, immediatelyafter the division on the Opposition Party&apos;amendment (i.e,, between 2*30 and 3*0 p.m.),Whitehall Gardens, 8.113th November, 1931.2) Whitehall  aa-nri^-nc    CW.1- 2f-
