LEAKAGE OPINFORMAT ION(previous reference:Cabinet 7$](51),  Con-elusion 1.)1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that within a few minutes of the termination of theprevious Meeting accounts were circulating in thelobbies of the House of Commons as to what had happened at the Cabinet on the subject of LandValuation and Land Value Tax,   Within an hour ofthe Meeting the Lord Privy Seal had endeavoured toget in touch with him &quot;by telephone in order to tell him of communications he had had from Pressmen onthe subject.The Cabinet were reminded that it was known inParliament that a statement was to be made on thesubject on the following day, so that there mighthave been a certain amount of &quot;intelligent antici-pation&quot;,In the course of the discussion the PrimeMinister read an extract from a letter from theCentral News Agency commenting on the success ofthe methods that had been adopted by the lateNational Cabinet for the issue of information tothe Press and expressing regret that it was notcontinuing on the same scale.   In this letterallusion was made to information derived from sidechannels as to what the Government was intendingon such subjects as anti-dumping and agriculture, .and it was suggested that it was as important asever to keep the public informed as to the facts of the situation.   The Prime Minister had informed the representative of another Agency who had spoken to him on the subject that if they wished forinformation they must see him or one of hisSecretaries, and that,if the Government had
information they desired to communicate to thePress they would do so through the official channel(Mr G.P.Steward) .   The Prime Minister concluded byasking his  colleagues to do their best to avoidand prevent premature disclosures or leakages suchas had recently occurred.
CABINET POLICY 2. Consideration of the Prime ministers and WORK.Memorandum on Cabinet Policy and Work fCP.-311w.e/N (31)) was postponed until the following day.
FRENCH 3.    The President of the Board of Trade)     TARIFFS.reminded the Cabinet]-.that, as he had alreadyjjew Surtaxreported, France had imposed a 15 per cent, surtax,(Previous the effect of which was to discriminate againstReference:Cabinet 81 certain British imports, and more particularly(31), Con-clusion 10.) coal, which was affected to the extent of 3/- af\. ton.   The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs had mentioned the matter to M. Laval, and on theoccasion of M. Flandin&apos;s recent visit the subject had been raised.   K. Flandin had said thatpersonally he regarded the surtax as a mistake.In addition, as the Cabinet were informed duringthe discussion, an   Official Note had been communicated to the French Government by theBritish Ambassador in Paris.   These representationshad so far produced no result.   The principal,though not the sole, effect of the French surtaxwas to put British coal importers at a disadvantageas compared with certain countries, notably poland and Germany, whose coal was purchased by France ona Sterling basis .   The French Government had beenreminded that when the Franc had depreciated,notwithstanding that the Government of the day had possessed the powers to discriminate against them, this had not been done, although in the caseof the Franc the depreciation had been much heavierthan in the case of the   sterling.   Before thesurtax had been imposed, the importation of british coal into France had already been reduced by a quota system, so that the fall in Sterling did not increase the quantity of British coal imported.
The Cabinet were informed that a good deal ofFrench capital was invested in the Polish miningindustry.The President of the Board of Trade mentioned that he had made some guarded remarks on thesubject in the House of Commons at the end of theprevious week, which had had an immediate effect in Paris,   He thanked the Chancellor of theExchequer for some observations he also had madein a public speech.    The difficulty of the presentposition was that not much could be done to meetthe French action under the Abnormal Importations(Customs Duties) Act.    He suggested, therefore,that the Adjournment of Parliament should be postponed two days in order to obtain Powers toimpose Duties against those countries whichdiscriminate against the United Kingdom.At this point the President of the Board ofTrade handed round a draft of a Customs Duties(Foreign Discrimination) Bill.In the course of the discussion the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs informed the Cabinetthat he had been in communication with the british ambassador in Paris on this subject (TelegramNot328 to Paris, dated December 8th).   He then read a reply, just received, in which the british ambassador pointed out that the effect of legisla-tion would be to let loose a tariff war.   Thiswould strengthen the reactionary and Nationalistmovement in France, and make co-operation with france more difficult than ever at the forthcomingA copy of this Bill is attached to the standardcopy of Cabinet Minutes.
Conferences on Reparations and Disarmament.   the ambassador therefore -urged postponement of theapplication of counter measures until it was assured that agreement was not possible.    In making thisrecommendation he recalled that theFrench Government was approaching a General election in which they would be opposed by strong forcesworking for a purely National policy.   The Secretaryof State described at some length the political aspects of the proposal.The Cabinet were reminded that the   Sterlingwas now depreciated to the extent of 30 per cent,and not 15 per cent,, as compared with the Franc;consequently, even after the imposition of thesurtax the British importer had an advantage of15 per cent;   but it was pointed out that this didnot affect the main point to which the Presidentof the Board of Trade had drawn attention, namely,the discrimination against British as comparedwith Polish and German importers.   The cabinet were also reminded that the Abnormal Importations(Customs Duties) Act included silk, which was animportant French export to this country.It was made clear in the discussion that theaction contemplated was in respect of discriminationby France against the United Kingdom vis-a-visother countries selling at Sterling prices, andnot of discrimination against the United Kingdomvis-a-vis    countries which remain on the GoldStandard;    that is to say, it was not a questionof the 15 per cent, surtax imposed by France owing-6-
That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should follow up his earlier representation, towhich no reply had been received,with a strong Note asking for thewithdrawal of the discrimination against British goods, making clear that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentexpected an early answer and thatif this was not satisfactory theywould introduce legislation, whichhad already been drafted.    Insomuchas Parliament might be summoned even before February 2nd, it was thoughtbetter not to insert in the Noteany date at which legislation wouldbe introduced.to our departure from the Gold Standard, but theapplication of the surtax to our detriment ascompared with other countries which sell coal to france  at Sterling prices .The Cabinet were agreed that appropriate action must be taken to deal with this situation,    they felt, however, that to legislate on the subjectbefore the Adjournment of Parliament might not be effective.    Tt would arouse so much public coritro-versy on both sides of the Channel that the FrenchGovernment, faced with a General Election in the spring, would not be in a position to make any concession.    In the circumstances the cabinet agreed -t
pglfl 4. The Cabinet had under consideration aRESTRICTIONS.Memorandum by the Minister of Health (Paper CP.(previous reference-        305 (31)) relative to the policy to be pursuedCabinet 7 5(31), Con-        regard to the Rent Restrictions Acts.     Attached toclusion 9.)the Memorandum was the Report of the interdepartmental committee under the Chairmanship ;-?f Lord Marley,which had been appointed by the Labour Government in1950.      This Committee reported in July last, andwere unanimous, with the exception of Mr. DuncanGraham, M.P, who submitted a Minority Report.After summarising the present position withregard to the housing shortage, and particularly thequestion of decontrol, the Memorandum suggested that what was needed was firstly that the decontrol ofthe better class of houses should be hastened, and secondly that decontrol of the class of the smallestand cheapest houses should be stopped until the acute shortage therein is over.     If this policy were adopted it would, however, be necessary thatthe whole effort of public enterprise in the formof subsidy and rate aid should, be concentrated onthe provision of these smaller houses;   by so doing -the date of decontrol for the smaller houses wouldbe expedited.The Memorandum further pointed out that any legislation on this subject must be contentious,but that controversy would not be avoided byinaction, and that the Government would be qn strongground in basing their legislation on the practicallyunanimous Report of the Interdepartmental Committee.
In this connection the Minister of Health drew attention to the proposal in the Report that houseswithin the existing rental limits of the Act should hedealt with in three categories and treated in the lightof demand and supply.      While thinking that the lowerlimit of the first of these categories might with advantage he put at a smaller figure, both in London andin the Provinces,  the Minister of Health advised, inview of the great political advantage in keeping as closely as possible to the recommendations of theCommittee, that the Committee^ figures should heof Commonsaccepted, but that the feeling of the House/should be tested on the point during the passage of the Bill,which could be amended if it was found that anextension of the category of houses to be decontrolledwas acceptable to the House.In conclusion, the Minister of Health asked for authority for the preparation of a Bill to give effectto the recommendations of the interdepartmental committee, pointing out that if legislation is to beintroduced soon after the Recess, the drafting of theBill must be put in hand forthwith.In the course of the discussion the question was raised as to whether the effect of concentrating thesubsidy on the smaller type of house would not be toincrease the total expenditure on the subsidy.   Theproportion of the subsidy to the total cost of each house would,  it was pointed out, be larger, and. theLocal Authorities would be encouraged to build morehouses .    On the other hand the Cabinet were reminded that the Local Authorities, for reasons of ecnomoy,-9-
had curtailed building schemes to a considerable extent.The Minister of Health was asked to giveconsideration to this aspect of the question,Reference was made to the comparative failureof efforts made in the past to ensure that theadvantage of the subsidy did not go to the producers of the houses.    The Minister of Health indicated that the failure to deal with this question success-fully in the past should not prevent further effortsbeing made in the same direction.The Cabinet agreed(a) That the Minister of Health shouldhave authority for the preparationof a Bill to give effect to therecommendations of the DepartmentalCommittee, as stiggested in CfP.-305(31), para.15..(b) That there would be no objectionto some general reference beingmade to the subject in the courseof Parliamentary Debate.
TOWN AND 5.  The Cabinet had before them a MemorandumCOUNTRY .PLANNING.&apos;     (paper CP. 308 (31)) by the Minister of Health*(Previous      entitled Town and Country Planning.     It was pointedReference:Cabinet 85 out in the Memorandum that the Town and Country(31), Oon-clusion 3.)planning Bill, introduced by the Labour Government in -the last Session, had met with very general support,but that its further progress had been prevented by the dissolution of Parliament.After setting out the various reasons whichrender the passage of early legislation on this subjectnecessary and desirable, the Minister of Health askedfor authority to introduce a Bill as soon as possible after the Recess, and stated that it was his intentionto subject the Bill of last Session, as it emerged from Committee, to a careful examination, with a viewto seeing what changes or amendments are desirable,and to consult any Organisations whose views it mightbe worth while ascertaining, in order to secure as large a measure of agreement as possible.The Cabinet authorised theMinister of Health tointroduce the Town and country Planning Bill assoon as possible after the recess.
Lf 0 &apos;ivINT1 ERNA? TONAL-IB&quot; SITUATION0D DISARMAMENT.(previous reference:Cabinet 80(31), Con-elusion 4.)6. The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Air (CP.-296 (31)) in which attention was invited to certain disquieting factors in the international air situation.   The early dateof the Disarmament Conference made it necessary toexamine the Issues to which the figures pointed.Some of these issues could be settled by theCommittee set up at the Meeting referred to in the margin, and further material would be furnished   -to that Committee;    others would need considerationby the Cabinet&quot;.Among the questions referred to by the Secretaryof State were the geographical conditions which had caused a great part of our Air Force units to be stationed in distant parts of the Empire1;   the size and dangerous situation of the Capital;    and thefacts that our first line Air Force ranked fifth    &apos;among tho: 3 of the world and was out-numbered bythe French Air Force by nearly three to one inEurope,, and by two to one in the world as a whole.Pending his further enquiries into the problem the Secretary of State informed the Cabinet thathis interim view might be summarised as follows:-&quot;(l) We are bound to claim at Geneva fulltheoretical parity with the world&apos;sstrongest Air Power - leaving it,of course, as an issue of domestic policy to what extent we translatethat claim into concrete reality:(2) The moderation - perhaps the excessivemoderation - of British air policy for years past has placed us in a positionof such serious disparity that the only hope.&apos;of effective air disarmament lies in persuading the French to reducedrastically their present overwhelmingair forces.The Secretary of State for Air informed theCabinet that he was expecting to receive a visit-12-

7. The Cabinet took note of a Report (CP. 279 (31)on Agricultural Policy, prepared in July, 1930*- &apos; &apos;    - -by a Committee of the Economic Advisory Council,and now circulated to the Cabinet by directionof the Prime Minister.The Chairman of the Committee had been Mr.E.D. Simon.      The Committee had examined with great  -care the pre-war and post-war periods in british agriculture, paying special attention to comparativevolumes of output, acreage under cultivation,employment afforded, etc.      They had analysed the causes of the present depression, had compared the..... ... . . .. ...position of agriculture with that of other unshelteredindustries, and had examined the case for reform in marketing and farming practice and the special position of cereal farming.Among their more important recommendations were the following -(a) That permanent Government assistance Inthe form of guaranteed prices oracreage subsidies, which would make it easier to continue obsolete methods,should not be given.     Any assistanceaccorded should be directed tofurthering the adoption of improvedmethods of production and distribution.(b) That agriculture should not be given state assistance such as is denied to otherdepressed basic industries.      Specialrelief,  if any, should not take the formof an unconditional grant to the farmer   /&apos;but should be given in such a way as toencourage reorganisation and the adaptation of farming methods to thenew relation between wages and prices.(c) That if exceptional measures, whetherpermanent or t...iporary, involving a departure from traditional economic policy, should be contemplated for theassistance of other industries, agriculturehad at least as strong a claim as anyother.The Prime Minister asked those of his colleaguesconcerned in Agriculture to give close attention tothis Report . -14-

The following is circulated by direction ofthe Prime Minister:-&quot;Men are very porous, weighty secrets oozingout of them, like quicksilver through clay jars&quot;.(Carlyle.    Frederick the Great).&quot;But let princes beware that the unsecretingof their affairs comes not from themselves.    Andas for cabinet counsels, it may be their motto&quot;Plenus rimarum sum&quot;  (l am full of leaks):      onefutile person, that maketh it his glory to tell,will do more hurt than many, that know it their duty to conceal&quot;,(Bacon&apos;s Essay.
