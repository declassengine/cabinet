1.   The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs invited his colleagues to give close study to aMemorandum on British Foreign Policy (C.P.-301 (31))prepared in the Foreign Office and which he had just circulated.   The considerations in the Memo-randum, as he had pointed out in his Note, deservedthe most careful attention, hut he had not yetformulated his own conclusions on them.The Prime Minister said that his idea was tohold a series of Cabinet Meetings after parliament had adjourned. These Meetings might, if convenient,begin on Wednesday, December 9th, and be continueddaily -as required, omitting Friday, Saturday andSunday, until the morning of Thursday, December17th, by which time he hoped that the cabinet business would be disposed of.
jl6 0THE OTTAWA 2. With reference to the Conclusion mentionedCONFERENCE *in the margin, the Cabinet had under consideration the Report of the Cabinet Committee on the ottawa conference (Paper C.P, S88 (31)),     For theConclusions and Recommendations of the Committee(previous as summarised on pages 11 and 12 of the Report,reference cabinet 82(31)  see Appendix.Conclusion 1),The various items in the Summary of conclusions and Recommendations (attached in the Appendix) were discussed..The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to afootnote on page 3 of the Cabinet Committee&apos;s Report(C.P..-288 (31)) stating that the President of theBoard of Trade reserved his opinion on the questionof a Dominion Wheat Quota until he had had anopportunity of considering the documents which hadbeen circulated to the Committee on the subject.The President of the Board of Trade said he had now studied the documents and considered a DominionWheat Quota to be probably more easily workablethan a Home Wheat Quota (which had already beenadopted by the Cabinet).The Prime Minister impressed on his colleagues the importance, in considering this question, ofbearing in mind the connection between economic arrangements and international politics.Some discussion took place as to whether theWheat Quota was intended to apply to the Dominionsonly or to the whole Empire, including India, andthe latter alternative was preferred.In order to give some assistance to the canadian government in resisting the strong pressure by theUnited States for greater facilities for Americanmanufactured goods in the Canadian market, it was urged that an announcement in regard to an EmpireWhea* Quota &quot;should be in Parliament h^ore the,.Adjournment.
The Cabinet agreed -f.H. EMPIRE WHEAT QUOTA.(a) To approve the principle of an EmpireWheat Quota, to be offered as a basisof negotiations at the Ottawa Confer-ense for an agreement in which thiscountry must receive an adequatequid pro quo:(b) That the Empire Wheat Quota shouldbe without any guarantee of price:(c) That the Cabinet Committee, in working out the details of the quota scheme, should bear in mind the various points mentioned inthe course of the Cabinet discus-sion,  e.g., no manipulation of theworld prices of wheat;    thedesirability of the Quota beingvariable on a sliding scale from year to year;    avoidance of friction with the Dominions;pooling arrangements between theportions of the Empire concerned as to their respective shares inthe Quota;    the desirability ofexploring the possibility ofmaking some provision for theArgentine to supplement.  the Empire C0uota, but with due regard to the effect of such anarrangement on other nations:(d) That the Cabinet Committee should arrange for representatives of theSecretarj&apos;&apos; of State for DominionAffairs, the President of theBoard of Trade, and the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries, toascertain the views of the trades concerned on the workability ofan Empire Wheat Quota,    Care shouldbe taken to ensure that the official representatives of the trades areconsulted:(e) That the President of the. Board ofTrade should circulate to theCabinet as early as possibleparticulars of the sources fromwhich our supplies of wheat, and flour have been obtained duringthe last ten years.   The figures should include, in addition, thetotal wheat production of thevarious countries from which supplies are drawn:PREFERENTIAL TARIFFS IN TEEUNITED&apos; KINGDOM.(f) To reserve for further discussion CommitteeConclusion (b) (i) on the principleof preferential tariffs on articlesof food (with or without specifiedexemptions, e,g.,wheat and meat)until the Committee&apos;s recommendationspromised in (b)(ii) are available:
(g) On the understanding that all questions relating to preferentialtariffs are reserved, to approvegenerally the remaining conclusions and Recommendations of the Committee,viz,:-TARIFF DISCUSSIONS WITH THE -DOMINIONS,TARIFF CONCESSIONS FROM THEDOMINIONS.(NOTE:  It was requested that,in the further Reportreferred to in theCommitteeTs Conclusion(d), as much informationas possible should begiven to show the valueof the Customs tariff preferences the Dominions-might be in a positionto give,)IMPORT HOARDS AND BULK PURCHASE.INDUST RIAL CO-OPERA&quot;&apos;ION.COLONIES AND PROTECTORATESTARIFF PREFERENCES .(For details under these various headingssee Appendix.)
G0VS5N!viSNTESTABLISHMENTSDismissal ofa CivilianEmployee ofthe Air ministry on the grounds of subversivepoliticalactivities.(previous reference:Cabinet 35(27) , Con-clusion 1).3.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Air (paper cp. 303 (31)) relative to the case of G,B. Jones,a temporary clerk employed at the Home AircraftDepot of the Royal Air Force at Henlow who,in the circumstances set put in the Memorandum,has received a written notice of dismissal which,in the events which have happened and in theabsence of further action, will take effect onThursday, December 3rd, 1931,As explained in this Memorandum, Joneshad for a long time past been suspected ,oftCommunisticT tendencies.     In the course of therecent General Election,. Jones was reported tohave said in the course of a speech in support ofthe local Labour candidate &quot;I do not urge thepeople to violence, but I sympathise with theunemployed who do use violence&quot;.     On receivingthis report, his Commanding Officer reviewed allthe circumstances and decided that JonesTretention at Henlow, where he had every opportunityof disaffecting large numbers of young Royal AirForce personnel, was undesirable, and he was accordingly given oral notice and subsequentlywritten notice of dismissalr the latter to take effect from the evening af November 26th.On the case being brought to the notice ofthe Air Council, following urgent representations by Sir William Jenkins, M.P. and Mr? Tr Griffith,M.P^, it was decided, in view pf the obvious
political implications, to suspend the notice for one week to allow of further investigation.     There is no definite evidence that Jones is a Communist, and he isstated by Sir W. Jenkins to bear an excellent character.After pointing out that there is no regulationwhich explicitly debars Civil Servants from speaking atpolitical meetings and that Jones might plead completeignorance of the traditional understanding governing the conduct of Civil Servants in regard to political activities, the Secretary of State stated in his memorandum that he entertained no doubt that it is notin the public interest that a man pf this stamp shouldcontinue to be employed at a Service Depot containingmany young airmen^ and for this and other reasons setout in paragraph 9 of the Memorandum, he recommendedthat the dismissal should take place as soon as theperiod of suspension expired, namely on the 3rdDecember next.    Having regard to the political consequences which would follow the acceptance of thisrecommendation, the Secretary of State for Air drew theattention of the Cabinet to the existing directions fordealing with Cominunists, laid down by the Cabinet onthe 1st June, 1937 (Cabinet 35 (27) Conclusion 1), asfollows : r,r,(a) Persons who can be shown by reasonableevidence to be actively engaged in the dissemination of ant ^constitutional and revolutionary propaganda, eitheroral or written, should be dischargedforthwith and without pension or $thersuperannuation benefit:
(b) Persons who merely label themselves asCommunists without taking any active part in the furtherance of Communismshould he eliminated as and whenopportunity offers, i.e. by dischargeon reduction,&quot;In this connection, the Secretary of Statefor Air pointed out that Jones could not be accusedon the available information, even of &quot;labellinghimself a Communist&quot;, and that he would like a rulingwhether speaking at a public political meeting of whatever complexion, is or is not to be regarded aslegitimate in the case of lower grade Civil Servants,whether established or not established.In conclusion? the Secretary of StatefsMemorandum invited answers to the following questions.(1) Is Jones&apos; dismissal to stand?(2) Do the directions quoted in paragraph 11of his Memorandum as regards Communistsstill hold?(3) Is the delivery of speeches at publicpolitical meetings permissible to lower grade Civil Servants, whether establishedor unestablished?The Secretary of State for Air informed theCabinet that, since the Memorandum was circulated, hehad had an opportunity to go further into the detailsof Jones&apos; speech, which emphasised the impressions of asubversive tendency;    for example, Jones had said -&quot;The Navy showed their stuff at Invergordon&quot;,The Cabinet, while fully recognising theimportance of maintaining discipline, felt that the needsof the case might perhaps be met by something short ofdismissal;    for example, a reprimand.      It was suggested
also that the Secretary of State for Air might arrangefor Jones&apos;  transfer elsewhere.The Cabinet agreed(a) That the Secretary of State for Air shouldnot dismiss Jones, but should arrangefor an appropriate reprimand.      In thecourse of this reprimand it should be pointed out that persons whose presenceIs subversive to discipline cannot be tolerated in Royal J\iv Force establish-ments;    that in so much as someelement of doubt existed as to Jones&apos;intentions in making the speech, thematter would be overlooked on thepresent occasion;    but if there was anyfurther instance of action on Jones&apos;part subversive to. discipline, his recent action would not be forgotten.The man in qhestion should be made tounderstand clearly that any repetition of his action would render him an undesirable employe and liable todismissalj(b) That the directions quoted inparagraph &quot;11 of C.P. andreproduced above should stand;(c) That as to the delivery of speechesat public political meetings bylower grade Civil Servants, theSecretary of State for Air should consult the Postmaster-General and as certain what are the rules issuedby his Department,
COTTON 4.    The Cabinet had before them a MemorandumTRADEDISPUTES.     by the Minister of Labour (Paper CP. 304 ( 31))stating that the following two important developments(previous     had taken place in the Cotton industry within the reference:Cabinet 30 .,     .   .(31), Con- last few ^ays *-(1) The Central Committee of the CottonManufacturers* Association has recommended the Local Associations to authorise themto give to the Operatives&apos; Trade Unionsone month1s notice of the Employers&apos;intention to determine all wages agreements,(S) The Master Cotton Spinners&apos; Federation has given a month&apos;s notice to the Trade Unionsof their intention to terminate 911December 31st the Hours Agreement of 1919.Neither       these courses makes any immediatechange in conditions.    The two developments have occurred independently of one another, but togetherthey indicate that the industry is about to bring toan issue, questions affecting labour costs which have,,for a long time, been the subject of controversy.Employers on both sides of the industry have long feltthat labour costs must be reduced in order that theindustry may he placed in a position to compete withother countries.After explaining the circumstances which have led up to the developments in question, the Minister ofLabour expressed the view in his Memorandum that there
was no immediate reason to apprehend stoppages of work,and that the action taken by the employers was certain to lead to negotiations.     While he proposed to keepin close touch with all developments, he stronglydeprecated any action which would suggest earlyintervention by the Government in either of the disputes.     The various organisations concerned mustbe made to realise that the responsibility for finding a solution of their problems rests mainly upon them,and they would only be too ready to seize on a proposal of Government intervention as a means of divestingthemselves of their responsibilities..The Minister of Labour informed thqCabinet that he would keep them in touch with&apos;any important developments in this dispute.The Cabinet took note of the^Minister of Labour*s statement.
EDUCATION AND 5.    The Cabinet had. before them a Note bygUPDLY OPBIOLOGISTS. the Secretary (CP. 291 (31)) covering the Report,dated May, 1931, of a Committee of the economic advisory Council on the Education and Supply ofBiologists. The Chairman of the Committee hadbeen Lord Chelmsford.The Committee had reported that there wasa substantial and growing demand for biologists for service at home and in the colonies tout aninsufficient supply of candidates.    A biologicalcareer made a comparatively small appeal, andbiology as a subject was not firmly established inschool curricula.     It was recommended that theGovernment should become a party to negotiationswith the universities and schools with the objectof securing greater facilities for the study ofbiology.     It was suggested that the President ofthe Board of Education should be invited to initiatethe negotiations.The Cabinet were informed that it had notbeen possible for the Economic Advisory Council toconsider this Report but that the Council were willing, in so far as they were concerned, toassent to its publication.The Cabinet had also under consideration a Memorandum (CP. 295 (31)) by the President ofthe Board of Education.     The President recommended the publication of the Chelmsford Report and was willing, in consultation with those of his colleaguesimmediately concerned, to consider whether therewas any direction in which action on the
recommendations of the Committee could usefully heinitiated.     It was by no means clear, however,in view of the present crisis, that any action could he taken at the moment.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the President of the Boardof Education should arrange forthe publication of the Reportattached to CP. 291  (51);(b) That the President of the Boardof Education, in consultation withthose of his colleagues immediately concerned (including the Secretaryof State for India) should considerwhether there is any direction inwhich action on the recommendationsof the Committee can usefully be initiated at the present tim^;(c) That the President of the Board ofEducation should get in touch withthe Universities of Oxford and cambridge, on the subject,
&quot;pjCULTURAL 6.     The Cabinet had before them a NotepOLlCiT:    THEHOIvlK WHEAT (C,P. 302 (31)) by the Minister of Agriculture,QUOTA.together with a Memorandum outlining a plan forthe application to millers and flour importers(previousPererence: of the principle of a q\iota for home grown wheat.Cabinet 81 (31)Conclusion 4).   The plan had already been approved in principlef.R. at the meeting of the Cabinet referred to in the margin.The Minister stated that he was about todiscuss his proposals with representatives of theprincipal organisations concerned and that it might become necessary, as a result of those discussions,to make some modifications of detail in the plan.It was explained in the Memorandum thatthe present proposals did not differ in essentialsfrom a plan prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture(in consultation with the Board of Trade and theBoard of Customs and Excise) in the early summer of1930.     The Memorandum went on to describe the natureof the quota, of the proposed quota certificatesand of the national Board to &quot;be set up.     The quotawould be prescribed by the Minister, might he variedfrom time to time, and would he maintained only solong as the price of British wheat of millingquality did not exceed a statutory maximum to benamed in the Act.     Among the duties of the board would be the issue of quota certificates and the regulation of sales (through approved corn merchants)in such a manner as to secure for the producers aprice approximating as closely as possible to thestatutory maximum.     Existing marketing machinery
would be used as much as possible.It was contemplated that quota certificateswould circulate and that dealings in them might become somewhat complicated;    but in every trans-action the underlying fact would remain that the certificate had been created in connection with an initial sale of wheat of milling quality.There were appended to the Memorandum anote of the draft heads of a Bill (Appendix I) andexplanatory notes on the plan (Appendix II).The Cabinet took note of theabove Memorandum and the headsof the draft Bill.mm
THE FRUITS, J,     The Cabinet had before them aVEGSTABIES and horticultural Note (CP, S99 (31)) under cover of whichPRODUCTS (EMERGENCYCUSTOMS DUTIES) the Secretary, by direction of the PrimeBILL.Minister, circulated Q draft of the Fruits,Vegetables and Horticultural Products(previous reference: (Emergency Customs Duties) Bill.     It wasCabinet 81 (31)Conclusion 5). explained that the Money Resolution uponwhich the Bill had been based had beenconsidered on Monday, November 30th, 1931,and that it had not been possible for theHome Affairs Committee, or the Cabinet, togive previous consideration to the Bill.In the exceptional circumstances the Prime Minister had authorised the intro-duction of the Bill in the House of Commonswithout further reference to the Cabinet, but had stated that the case must not be regardedas a precedent, and that in future theprocedure laid down in C,P. 205 (31), underwhich Bills are only to be introduced on reccomendatons of the Home Affairs committee approved by the Cabinet, should be strictlyfollowed.The Minister of Agriculture and fisheries reported that the Bill had been brought into line with the Financial Resolution, so as toprovide that the duties could be charged by reference to value, weight, measurement orquantity, as may be provided in the Order,
The attention of the Cabinet was called tothe fact that bulbs were mentioned in the preamble to the Bill,  contrary to what the Cabinet had beeninformed at the meeting referred to in the margin.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesexplained that bulbs had now become a matter ofsome importance, owing to the fact that Dutchbulbs, being excluded from Germany, were likely toflood the British market.      The Cabinet were informed, however, that the Cornish flowerindustry did not itself raise bulbs, but dependedto an important extent on imported bulbs for thevariety of its produce.The Cabinet approved the bill and took note that, before issuingany Order applying the Act tobulbs, the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries would bring thematter before the Gabinet.

APPENDIX.COMMITTEE ON THE PROPOSED IMPERIAL ECONOMIC CONFERENCEAT OTTAWA.SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.24. The Conclusions and Recommendations of the committee may &quot;be summarised as follows:-Dominion Wheat Quota (paragraph ,7)*(a) (i) Subject to the decision to be reached by theCabinet on the proposals of the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries (see paragraph 5of this Report)  the United Kingdom Governmentare now prepared to offer a Dominion wheat quota. s(ii) In the event of the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs being authorised to offer a Dominion Wheat Quotas that quota shouldbe without any guarantee of price.Preferential Tariffs in the United Kingdom,(paragraphs 8 &amp;(b) (i) The Governments mandate does not rule outpreferential tariffss and accordingly theSecretary of State for Dominion affairs should proceed on the assumption thatpreferential tariffs on articles of food(with or without specified exemptionss e.g.,wheat)  are now permissible in principle asa basis for discussion with the Dominions,.(ii) The Committee&apos;s recommendations as to thearticles which appear to be most.suitablefor possible tariff concessions...to theDominions will be embodied in a later Reportto the Cabinet,Tariff Discussions with the Dominions (paragraph 15).(c) (i) Discussions must be conducted in the firstinstance with each Dominion on the following basis.(l) That concessions by the United kingdom should be balanced by an adequatepreference to the United Kingdom onthe part of the Dominion concerned.* See? however? foot-note at bottom of page 3 of Report, which reads as follows:-&quot;The President of the Board of Trade reserves his opinionon the question of a Dominion Wheat Quota until he hashad an opportunity of considering the documents which havebeen circulated to the Committee on the subject.&quot;
(2) That It should be explained to each dominion in turn that it was proposedto offer the concession made by theUnited Kingdom with regard to any article   to other Dominions (ifinterested in the article) but onlyin exchange for a correspondingadequate preference.(3) That in the event of failure to secure a corresponding adequate preferencefrom a Dominion desiring to receivethe United Kingdom concession,abandonment of the concession in respectof that Dominion would be the firstresult, but in that case the wholecircumstances would have to be reviewed again, and conceivably the originalarrangement might have to be abandonedor modified.(c) (ii) The results of all the discussions in accordancewith the above procedure should be reviewed bythe Ottawa Conference, and if it were found thatthe reciprocal mutual concessions were generally satisfactory, those concessions should beconsolidated into a single multilateralrecommendation by the Conference.Tariff Concessions from the Dominions (paragraphs 16-18)*(d) It is hoped to obtain further tariff concessions from the Dominions.      The Committee&apos;s recornmenda-tions regarding commodities on which new or increased customs tariff preferences in each ofthe Dominions would he of assistance to theexport trade of the United Kingdom, will becomprised in a further report to be submittedby the Committee to the Cabinet in due course.Import Boards and Bulk Purchase (paragraph 19).(e) Any idea of Import Boards and Bulk Purchaseshould be ruled out from consider a t i on.Industrial Co-operation (paragraph 20).(f) Approval should be given for the furtherance ofa scheme of Inter-Imperial industrial co-operation on the lines suggested in the Report (paper,C. (30)  28)  of the Inter-Departmental Committee.Colonies and Protectorates Tariff Preferences(paragraph 23)&quot;.     *&apos; &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;(g) (i) The Secretary of State for the Colonies should beat liberty to make suggestions to the Chancellorof the Exchequer with regard to preferences oncommodities imported into the United Kingdom fromthe Colonies, whether those commodities are nowsubject to customs duties or not.(ii) The acceptance of any suggestion under (i) above should not necessarily be made dependent upon thegrant of reciprocal concessions by the Coloniesconcerned.
