THE DEBATE ON 1.   The Prime Minister expressed regret that,THE ADDRESS. ,owing to the great pressure,of business, it had , been impossible to arrange a Meeting of the Cabineton the previous day.   The present Meeting, he explained, had been summoned mainly to considerarrangements to be made by the Cabinet in connec-tion with the Debate on the Address, which would begin the same afternoon.   He mentioned that he had instructed the Parliamentary Secretary to theTreasury to sound the Parliamentary Opposition asto whether they would be willing for the House ofCommons not to meet on Friday next, November loth,on the understanding that the Debate on the Addresswould be concluded on Monday next, November 16th.,As the result of a short discussion the follow-ing general arrangements were made:-(a) That, in order to release the PrimeMinister for other urgent government business, the Lord President of theCouncil, after the Prime minister had made his speech on the first day,should take charge generally of theGovernment Front Bench arrangements in the Debate on the Address:(b) That it was desirable that theGovernment Front Bench should notbe denuded of Ministers during the debate on the Address, as this was liable to make a bad impression onthe House of Commons and particularly on the large numbers of new Members.The Parliamentary Secretary to theTreasury should accordingly beresponsible to the Lord Presidentof the Council for arranging thatone or two members of the cabinet should be available:(c). That the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the President of the Board ofTrade should be prepared to inter-vene in the Debate if and when required.
o9PARLIAMENTARYARRANG EMENT S .Business ofSess ion.The King*sSpeech.(previous reference:Cabinet 75(31), Con-clusion 2.)2. The Cabinet discussed in a preliminaryway the business to be considered during thepresent Session.The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that the principal Bills of which he had knowledgewere the following:-THE STATUTE OP WESTMINSTER,    this being theonly Billmentioned in theKingrs Speech,THE EXPIRING- LAWS CONTINUANCE BILL,THE EDUCATIONAL ENDOWMENTS(SCOTLAND) BILL,THE INDIAN PAY (TEMPORARY ABATEMENTS) BILL.In addition, the question of the london passenger TRANSPORT BILL had still to be decided.The Prime Minister added that all the abovesubjects had been included on the Agenda paper for the Meeting of the Cabinet arranged for thefollowing day.As the Parliamentary Session would be a shortone, the Prime Minister asked his colleagues tobear in mind that if any special powers would berequired by the Government during the Recessthey ought to be obtained before Parliament rises.
THE FINA.NO TALAND ECONOMICSITUATION.(previous reference:Cabinet 73(31), Con-cliis ion 1.)2. A short discussion of a preliminary character took place on questions relating to thefinancial and economic situation which were liableto be raised during the Debate on the Address in both Houses of Parliament.   Among the specificsubjects referred to were the followingU)  FUTURE OF THE   STERLING.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he wouldbe satisfied if the question could be dealt withon the general lines adopted by the Prime minister in his speech at the Guildhall on the previous evening.   He entered a caveat T however, against any attempt to state when the   sterling could be stabilised or when an International Conference onthe Monetary Situation could be arranged.    Speakerswould be on safe ground if they confined themselvesto the immediate need of balancing the Budget and maintaining the internal value of the   sterling.(3) BALANCE OF TRADE.The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave some preliminary figures on this subject that had been worked out Departmentally some weeks before,forecasting an adverse balance of trade of about 86 millions for the year .    Information as to subsequent months did not appear to improve theprospect.The Cabinet felt that before a statement wasmade in Parliament the facts should be obtained and that the subject required further consideration(See Conclusions below) .
(S)  EXCESSIVE IMPORTATIONS AND &quot;DUMPING&quot;.The Cabinet were informed that questions were likely to arise and to be pressed at an early stage in the Debate on the Address on these subjects.Recent statistics did confirm the reports published in the Press as to considerable increases inimportations during the last few weeks, whether inapprehension of the imposition of a tariff orotherwise.    It was felt desirable that the-factsshould be obtained as soon as possible, in orderthat an appropriate statement might be made duringthe Debate on the Address (See Conclusionsibelow).The Cabinet were reminded of the confusionthat was apt to arise between a mere excess ofimports and &quot;dumping&quot;, a term which connoted thesale in this country of goods manufactured abroadat a price lower than the cost of production.During the discussion the Prime minister referred to Memoranda that had been prepared forthe use of previous Governments over which he hadpresided and which he thought ought to be availableto the present Government.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the President of the Board ofTrade should, as soon as possible,enquire into, and present theCabinet with a Report on, the fact as to any abnormal excess of importsor &quot;dumping&quot; from foreign countriesduring recent weeks, with a view toenabling a decision to be taken asto what was to be said, on the subjectduring the Debate on the Address:(b) That the above question   should beplaced on the Agenda Paper of theCabinet at an early date:(c) That the President of the Board ofTrade should consider the desirabilityof circulating to his colleagues forinformation, as proposed by the
Prime Minister, Memoranda dealingwith Commercial Treaties and anti-Dumping Legislation (PapersT.S.C.  (31)  5 and T.S.O.  (31)  8respectively) which had originally been prepared by his predecessorin the Labour Government and had subsequently been circulated to aCommittee of the last Government.I also circulated onSeptember 25th tothe Cabinet as c.p. 24.2 (51) .(d)(e)That the Prime Minister should circulate to the Cabinet a Reporton the Balance of InternationalPayments, prepared by a Sub-Committeeof the Economic Advisory Councilknown as the Committee on Economicunder theInformation, which metChairmanship of Sir(Paper E.A.C.(S.C.)Jos iah1): JeStamp,G .B.E,That if Ministers desired to circulateany further Memoranda on the subjects of excessive imports,  &quot;dumping&quot; andthe balance of trade, they should communicate them in the first instance to the Prime Minister:(f) That further consideration by theCabinet of the question of theBalance of Trade should be reservedfor the moment.(g)(h)andThat the subject of Cabinet machinerydealing with the interconnectedgroup of financial and economic questions, whether by cabinet committees, Government Departments,for or otherwis ethe Agenda, should be placed on paper at an early Meetingof the Cabinet, when the PrimeMinister would hope to make proposals:That in the case of the Debate inthe house of Lords, where questions relating to excessive imports,&quot;dumping&quot;, balance of trade, etc.,were liable to be raised immediately,the representatives of the Government-should base themselves on thefollowing passage in the King&apos;s Speech:-&quot;The important problems involved are already under detailed examina-tion by My Government.   decisions will be taken and applied with theleast possible delay, and in due course any legislation that may berequired will be submitted toParliament&quot;.
