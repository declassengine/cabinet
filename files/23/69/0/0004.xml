(previous reference:Cabinet 62(51), Con-clusion 4.)1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that the Council of the Leagueof Nations was to resume consideration of theChino-Japanese dispute in Manchuria at Paris onMonday next, November 16th.In the course of a full statement he described the nature of the Japanese interests and rights in manchuria.   They had declared that they had no territorial designs, but the South Manchuria railwaywas Japanese property, with extended rights of a character similar to those exercised in Canada bythe Canadian Pacific Railway. &quot;One of the causes ofthe dispute was the construction by the Chinese of competing railways, which created economic diffi-culties with Japan.He then described the origin of the disputeand the subsequent course of events.    On September21st Dr. Sze, the Chinese representative, had invokedthe Council of the League of Nations as a &quot;friendlyright&quot; under Article XI of the Covenant.   TheSecretary of State then referred to the appealmade by the League to both sides to adopt a reason-able attitude, to withdraw troops, etc.   TheJapanese, he added, had made clear that they couldnot withdraw their troops until the safety of japanese lives and property was assured and theirTreaty position regularised.The Japanese representative at Geneva had not put his country?s case very well, and had spoken ofcertain fundamental principles that had to be cleared up with China before evacuation could takeplace, without specifying what they were.    On the26th October, however, the Japanese Government hadJapaneseAction in manchuria
made a communication of what these fundamental principles were.   The fifth principle referred to respect for the Treaty rights of Japan in Manchuria.They considered that these principles should properly form the subject of negotiations betweenthe parties directly involved.   The Council of theLeague had eventually given the Japanese Governmentnotice to withdraw their troops from points outsidethe railway zone by Monday next, November 16th,This was a serious step, because the League had nomeans to make the notice effective.   The attitudeof the League in this matter had been criticised by the American Secretary of State, who had thought the Japanese Government could not possibly meet this demand.   The United States Government had supported the attitude of the League, but it wouldbe wrong to assume that they would, participate inputting pressure on Japan.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs emphasised that a difficult situation would arise if the Chinese delegate were to shift his appeal tothe League from Article 11 (&quot;friendly right&quot;) to article 16 (Sanctions).   Article 16 provided that&quot;Should any Member of the League resort to war in disregard of its covenantsunder Articles XII, XIII, or XV, itshall ipso facto be deemed to have committed an act of war against allother Members of the League, whichhereby undertake immediately tosubject it to the severance of alltrade or financial relations  .....as well as other sanctions of a similar character.China (as was pointed out by the Prime Minister) had only to prove the violation of Articles XII, XIIIand XV of the Covenant to commit Members of theLeague automatically to these sanctions,
As had been shown at the time of the Oorf-uincident, however, it was not a practicable policyin a case of this kind to impose the sanctionsprovided for in Article XVI, which would involvethe imposition of very drastic restrictions on trade, including censorship of various kinds .The withdrawal of Ambassadors, which had also beensuggested, would be equally unwise.   The only wayto exercise any influence on the Japanese Govern-ment was to keep a representative of high standingat Tokyo.   A third suggestion, that an international force, drawn from Legation Guards, and so forth,should be sent to Manchuria, appeared inapplicable,since the Japanese were entitled to police theSouth Manchuria Railway.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that he had received some information of a more reassuring character, indieat-ing a partial withdrawal of Japanese troops in some places.The Cabinet generally approved the suggestions of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs as tothe line which he should take at the forthcomingmeetinn of the Council of the League of Nations inParis.   These views may be summed up as follows:-The League of Nations should beupheld.     The Cabinet recognised,however,  inter seT that the sanctionsprovided for in Article XVI of theCovenant were not suitable and couldnot in practice be applied in thepresent case.    In the interests ofthe League itself, therefore, everyeffort must be made&apos; to avoid theChinese appeal being shifted fromArticle XI to Article XVI.     Ifnecessary, it must be impressed onthe Chinese delegate that he mustassist the League and not throw theresponsibility on to the other membersof the Council.   The Japanese delegatemight be reminded that Japan was regarded as one of the principalcreators of the League.    It was
unlikely, however, that theJapanese Government eould be induced to withdraw their troops from places outside the railwayzone in Manchuria before negotia-tions had taken place;   but itmight be possible to arrange for discussions on the Treaty situationside by side with the question of withdrawl of troops, in order to save the face of both parties .In a word, the policy of theUnited Kingdom representative should be one of conciliation,with an avoidance of impliedthreats ,It was suggested to the Secre-tary of State, with the general approval of the Cabinet, that itmight assist in carrying out thispolicy if he were to propose themaintenance of the status quo fora few days, during which negotiations could take place:    that is to say,troops would not be withdrawn, butthey would not be reinforced, andwould remain where they were whilenegotiations were started.The Secretary of State was also asked to bear in mind the importanceof not giving the Japanese hostilePress any excuse to place the odiumfor the initiative on this country,as had already been done for commercialreasons.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed his colleagues that as Viscount Cecil ofChelwood had taken the Marquess of Reading&apos;s placein the concluding stages of the previous sessionof the Council on this question, and as the meetingon November 16th was a continuation of that session,he would be accompanied by Lord Cecil.    It was his intention, however, personally to act as spokesmanof the United Kingdom Government.The Cabinet invited the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs to conduct the negotiations in the light of thediscussion briefly summarised above,and took note of his intention toreport fully to them on the subject.

The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary (CP.-205 (31)) covering the following documents :-(i) Existing instructions to the Secretaryto the Cabinet.(ii) Existing instructions as regards cabinet committees and Conferences.(iii) Submission of Business to the Cabinet;Circular Letters from the Treasurydated 25th February, 1931, and 28th  .April,  1924.(iv) Economic Advisory Council:    Copy of treasury Minute of Appointmentdated January 27, 1931..A separate Note on the Economic AdvisoryCouncil was attached in Appendix V.The Cabinet were informed that the late Gove.ru..ment had taken note of the above documents onSeptember 7, 1931.The Prime Minister invited his colleagues tomake themselves familiar with the above documents,and, if they required any further information,   toapply to the Secretary to the Cabinet.The Prime Minister added that he felt itincumbent on him to say a word about the secrecy ofCabinet Minutes.      He appealed to his colleagues totake the utmost personal precautions to ensure thataccess to Gabinet Minutes was limited to responsiblepersons of proved confidence, and that they should always be kept under lock and key.The Cabinet took note of the documentsattached to CP.  205 (^1), and of thePrime Minister&apos;s statement summarised above.HOME AFFAIRSCOMMITTEE.(previous reference:Cabinet if(31), Con-elusion 2) .The Gabinet took note that the Home AffairsCommittee, as re-appointed by the late Government,was composed as follows
The Lord Chancellor (Chairman),The Chancellor of the Exchequer orRepresentative,The Secretary of State for HomeAffairs,The Secretary of State for Scotland,The Minister of Health,The President of the Board of Trade,The President of the Board of Education,The Minister of Labour,The Attorney-General,The Solicitor-General.
4 8rpHE ottawa conference,(previous reference:Cabinet 73(31),  Con-c Ins ion 3.)if.      The Cabinet were informed that at the last meeting of the late Government it had been agreed in principle  &quot;That as soon as the Government hasbeen re-r-constituted, a CabinetCommittee should be set up whichwould include the following Ministers :-The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Agriculture and   -Fisheries -to examine all matters relating to the ottawa Conference and to make recommend-ations to the Cabinet as to the policyof His Majesty1s Government in theUnited Kingdom at the Conference:    theCommittee to have authority to invitethe attendance of other Ministersad hoc as required.&quot;The Cabinet confirmed the above termsof reference, and composition of the Gommittee,with the addition of the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.The Prime Minister left the formal decision as to the Chairmanship to the Committee itself,but intimated that in the ordinary course ofCabinet procedure the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should convene the Committee and take the Chair.
5, The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Minister of Health (CP .-269 (31)) statingthat it was necessary to obtain at a very early, dated decision whether an Act should be passed to extend the Health Insurance and Contributory Pensions rightsof persons who, by reason of continuous and prolonged unemployment over a period of at least two and a half years, would otherwise cease to be insured onthe 31st December next.   At present the extensionreferred to was provided by the Prolongation of insurance Act, 19 30, which preserves until the 31stDecember, 1931, the insurance rights (both health and Contributory Pensions) of those insured persons,estimated to be between 60,000 and 100,000 in number,who would otherwise have had those rights broughtsummarily to an end on the 31st December, 1930.The numbers affected now were estimated at about60,000 to 70,000 in all, and the cost to the exchequer of paying the necessary contributions to support the health Insurance of these persons and to provide the related State Grant towards the cost of benefits(as was done in the 1930 Act) would be about  110,000for the twelve months.    It would not be necessary topay any contributions to the Pensions Account inrespect of these persons, but this account wouldhave to bear the liability for Pensions.   The MayCommittee had recommended that no further provision should be made for prolongation after this year,thus saving the cost involved to the Exchequer.At the end of August the late Government had taken the view that it would be advisable to renew theAct for a further year, but no announcement hadbeen made.    The Minister of Health reported in his memorandum that he himself had formed the opinion,
on grounds of financial and Insurance principles(which he explained in detail), that prolongationshould cease both for Health Benefits and Pensions.The Cabinet were informed that, during therecent General Election, the Prime Minister andsome of his colleagues had made public statementsbased on the decision of the late Government,(Cabinet 50 Conclusion 1),  to the effect &quot;thatthe Prolongation of Insurance Act would be renewedby a separate Bill&quot;.      In these circumstances,apart from political and other considerations, whichwere discussed at some length,  it was felt thatit would be difficult to avoid renewing the Actfor a further year.In the course of the discussion a suggestion was made that an Inter-Departmental committee might be appointed to examine the whole matter.The Cabinet were reminded, however,  that the second report of the Royal Commission on UnemploymentInsurance should be available at the beginning ofJanuary, if indeed it could not be expedited.It was suggested that the Health Insurance andContributory Pensions rights of persons now coveredby the Prolongation of Insurance Act could best be examined in the light of and at the sairo time asthe Second Report of the Royal Commission.
For this purpose it was suggested that a specialenquiry $light be necessary.The Cabinet agreed  To confirm the decision of thelate Cabinet &quot;that the prolongation of Insurance Act should be renewedby a separate Bill&quot;, on theunderstanding that this should bea temporary measure, pendingreconsideration of the wholequestion in the light of theSecond Report of the royal Commissionon Unemployment Insurance.

Perhaps inthe circumstances of urgency in -which the Governmenthad been compelled to act,  the announcement hadnot been made in an appropriate form.      He proposed,therefore, that the Judges should be notifiedthat the Gabinet had considered once more thequestion of economies, and that they would liketo invite the Judges themselves to consider whetherthey would be willing to propose a reduction intheir emoluments, as contemplated in the white paper.The Gabinet approved the above vproposal, and arranged that theLord chancellor,  in consultationwith the Secretary of State forWar, should assist the PrimeMinister to put the communicationin a form acceptable to the Judges.The communication would be signed by the Prime Minister.-Mi--
