5* The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs(C.P.-268 (31)) circulating a telegram he hadreceived from the Canadian Government proposing that the adjourned Economic Conference should be convened at Ottawa at the earliest possible date.The Secretary of State suggested that a CabinetCommittee should be set up at once to.consider thesituation and to supervise the arrangements,The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs informed his colleagues that the late Governmenthad set up a Cabinet Committee and an Inter-Depart-mental Committee to make preparations for the ottawa conference and that a large amount of materialhad already been collected.   He proposed that theInter-Departmental Committee should continue its work.The Cabinet agreed in principle -(a) That as soon as the Government hasbeen re-constituted, a CabinetCommittee should be set up whichwould include the following Ministers:-The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Agriculture andFisheries -to examine all matters relating to the ottawa Conference and to make recommend-ations to the Cabinet as to the policyof His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom at the Conference:    theCommittee to have authority to invitethe attendance of other Ministersad hoc as required.
3 LONDONSENGERmpORTjposed Issue; 500,000)ck by tnej,don General[ibus Company,jeyiousferenee;binet 65i) , Con-us ion 6).jFRif.    The Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum(CP.  266 in which the Minister of Transportreported that the Underground Group desired to be in aposition to issue before the end of the year anadditional  500,000 (nominal)  5 per cent, Cumulative IncomeDebenture Stock of the London General Omnibus Company.The Minister explained in his Memorandum that new capital was required because the Company had oVer-spent their capital account in carrying out replacementprogrammes, etc.This was not a matter with which theCabinet would have been troubled if unforeseen delayshad not taken place in the passage of the London passenger transport Bill,      It had been contemplated in the earlier stages that the Transport Board would have taken overthe various undertakings in the London area on the 1stJanuary next and a scheme of temporary finance up tothat date had been agreed by his predecessor, to covernecessary expenditure of this kind up to that date.The Company was of course not in a position to issue suchStock save at a substantial discount.      On the otherhand,  if the Company proved able to raise capitalon terms not less favourable than would have beenpossible for the Board, the latter might benefit by being ^relieved from a nremature anneal to the marketsThe adfei.tl.on of  500,000 to tne Company&apos;sDebenture Stock would increase by a correspondingnominal figure the amount of 5 per cent. &quot;B&quot; TransportStock to be issued by the Board (after the Bill had come into operation) in consideration for thetransfer.   This &quot;B&quot; Stock would enjoy Trustee status.The proceeds of the issue would meet the LondonGeneral Omnibus company capital requirementstip to January, 1932.   If, however, further Parlia-mentary delays made it necessary to postpone the-5-
establishment of the new Board, additional demandsmight be expected, both for this Company and forother undertakings affected by the Bill.The position had been examined by Sir WilliamMoLintook, who was satisfied with the terms of theproposed issue and of the subsequent exchange of stock.The Minister accordingly sought Cabinet authorityto inform Lord Ashfield that the Government would doits best to carry an amendment to the london passenger Transport Bill, if it were proceeded with,providing for the issue of Transport WB&quot; Stock upto the nominal amount of  500,000 in exchange forthe additional Omnibus debenture stock to be issued under his proposal, on the understanding that theterms upon which the Stock was to be issued were approved by the Minister after consultation with theTreasury and Sir William MeLintock.On the main question of the passage of theBill, the Minister emphasised the desirability of expediting its enactment, and asked, therefore, for authority to put down at an early date a Motion toenable consideration of the Bill to be resumed.After dismissing the matter with the Ministerof Transport the Cabinet agreed  (a) That on political grounds it was undesirable that the Minister ofTransport should give Lord Ashfieldthe undertaking for which he asks:(b) That the following Ministers -The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The President of the Board of Trade -should assist the Minister of transport in negotiations with Lord Ashfield,with the object of avoiding theproposed issue of Transport (B) Stock:-6-
(o) That the question of expediting the enactment of the london passenger Transport Bill mustbe reserved until after there-constitution of the Govern-ment, when it should be placedon the Agenda of the Cabinet.-7-
5.    The President of the Board of trade informed the Cabinet that wheat prices had risenrather more than he had led them to anticipateat the last meeting.      Manitoba wheat had risen to 34-/-, and the price was still tending toharden.     Russia was hardly in the market as aseller of wheat at present,  although he had not had information to confirm the rumours that theRussians were actually buying back wheat.r     Inthese circumstances flour must rise to a point atwhich the price of the loaf would be increased.He informed his colleagues of the action he proposed to deal with this situation,  including,in certain contingencies,  the appointment of aGommittee of the Pood Council, with compulsory powers of investigation.The Cabinet were reminded that the low priceof prime commodities was one of the principalcauses of the present economic difficulties ofthe world./   The President of the Board of Trade has sinceheard that this has happened on a small scale.
NEXT MEETING 6.    The date of the next Meeting of theOP CABINET.Cabinet was left to the Prime Minister.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,November 5, 1931.
The Kiag&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.November 10th, 1931.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons.MY relations with foreign Powers continue to be friendly.My Government intend to pursue the policy of promoting peace and good-will and to continue their active interest in the work of the League of Nations.Particular]y, they are giving close attention to the preparations for the approaching Disarmament Conference, the successful result of which would, I am convinced, produce great and universal benefit.The serious financial and economic situation of the world deeply concerns my government. They will do their utmost in co-operation with other Governments,and in the spirit of mutual helpfulness, to find ways for restoring the volume ofinternational trade.The Indian Round Table Conference continues its work, and a conference with Representatives of Burma will very shortly assemble. It is My earnestprayer that the deliberations of both these Conferences may be crowned with success.In conformity with the undertaking given to the Representatives of MyDominions in 1930, a Measure will be laid before you to give statutory effect tocertain of the Declarations and Resolutions of the Imperial Conferences of 1926and 1930. This Measure is designed to make clear the powers of DominionParliaments and to promote the spirit of free co-operation amongst Members ofthe British Commonwealth of Nations.My Government have received from the Government of My Dominion ofCanada a proposal that the Economic Conference, which was adjourned in 1930,should be convened at Ottawa as soon as possible. This invitation has been welcomed by My Ministers and will be considered in the most sympathetic spirit and with an earnest desire to come to some mutually advantageous arrangement with the Governments of My Dominions.Members of the House of Commons,The Estimates for the public services will be laid before you in due course.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,The Nation, at the General Election, endorsed those measures for securingeconomy and balancing the National Budget which constituted the first essentialsteps in the solution of the financial and economic problems with which thecountry has been confronted.The Nation was also invited by My Ministers to empower them to pursue apolicy designed fully to re-establish confidence in our financial stability and togive them authority to frame plans for ensuring a favourable balance of trade.They further sought from the Nation unfettered discretion to consider everyproposal likely to be of assistance in these matters.My Ministers have now received a clear and emphatic mandate to that effect.The important problems involved are already under detailed examination by my Government. Decisions will be taken and applied with the least possible delay, and in due course any legislation that may be required will be submittedto Parliament.And I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon yourdeliberations.[6&apos;55]
