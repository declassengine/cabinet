1.   The Prime Minister said that he had summonedthe present Meeting in accordance with the usualcustom that the Cabinet should meet immediatelyafter a General Election.   He added that he proposedto reconstruct the Government.   For this purposehe asked that the offices of all Ministers mightbe put at his disposal,  in order to give him a freehand in the reconstruction, in which he would invitethe oo-operation of the Leaders of the other political Parties concerned,   He proposed to enlarge the Cabinet to the normal size.   This wasnecessitated by the fact that a number of compli-cated and technical questions would immediatelyarise which would have to be referred to cabinet committees.   Some of these subjects would requirethe assistance of technical assessors, but of course the Ministers alone would be responsible for theReports, Conclusions and Recommendations to theCabinet.

The Prime Minister informed the Cabinetthat he hafi written to Captain The Right Hon.E.A.FitzRoy asking if he was willing to be re-nominatedas Speaker of the House of Commons.A short discussion took place as to the programme to be submitted to the House of Commons before christmas .   The general view of the Cabinet wasthat at the present stage, pending the- detailedenquiries referred to in the preceding Minute, theGovernment would not be in a position to ask for much assistance from Parliament in its major policy.In order to free Ministers as far as possible forthe study of these larger questions it was desirableto limit the opening part of the Session to theKingTs Speech and certain indispensable legislation,including the Statute of Westminster, the expiring laws Continuance Bill, a Bill desired by the Secre-tary of State for India to permit temporary reduc-tions in the pay of Crown Servants in India, and anyother minor Bills that might fall within this category.The Cabinet were reminded that a decision would shortly be required as to the Bill to renew the prolongation of the Insurance Act.
mHE EINGf SSPEECH.(previous reference:Cabinet 71(51), Con-elus ion 1 *)THE indian round table conference.(previous reference:Cabinet 56(31), Con-clusion 1.)a.3. The Cabinet had a short discussion as tothe general lines of the King&apos;s Speech on theOpening of Parliament.   This, it was proposed,apart from the traditional formal passages, shouldbe limited as nearly as possible to a singleparagraph of substa,nce, reciting the mandate whichthe new Government had received from the electors(vide the Prime Minister&apos;s Manifesto of October 8,,1931) and indicating that close study of a numberof complicated questions would be required beforethe Government were in a position to submit legisla-tion to Parliament.   The Speech must, however,contain a specific reference to the Statute of westminster (See, Conclusion 4) and to the work ofIndianthe^Round Table Conference.   The Cabinet inclined to the view that it would be unnecessary to include any reference to Bills that were not of the first importance, some of which would probably be dealtwith after the Recess.The Cabinet agreed  That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows -The Lord Chancellor,The Home Secretary,The Minister of Health -should meet(a) to prepare a first draft of theKing&apos;s Speech on the above lines,for consideration by the Cabinet:(b) to make suggestions as to the mover and Seconder of the Addressboth in the House of Lords andin the House of Commons.It was arranged that the above committee should meet on FridayOctober 30th, at 3 p.m., in the&apos;Cabinet Room at 10 Downing Street.

The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs informed the Cabinet that the outstanding difficul-ties with the Commonwealth of Australia had been cleared up, and by the time the Statute of Westmin-ster was introduced he hoped to be able to inform parliament that the introdustion of the Bill, whichwas already in draft, had been asked for by allthe Dominions.There was general agreement that, in order togive satisfaction to the Dominions, it was essentialto mention the Statute of Westminster in the King&apos;sSpeech.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairsadded that he did not contemplate any interferencewith the Right of Appeal from the Irish Free state to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.The Articles of Agreement for a Treaty betweenGreat Britain and Ireland still stood and could notbe altered except by mutual agreement between thetwo Governments concerned.4-
INT ERNATIONAL 5. The Prime Minister reminded the CabinetACTION. that their general policy would require inter-national action.
6..A short discussion of a preliminary charactertook place on the subject of food prices, in thecourse of which the President of the Board ofTrade informed his colleagues that a small risehad taken place in the price of wheat, and a furthersmall rise must be expected in the near future,which would involve some increase in the price of flour.
