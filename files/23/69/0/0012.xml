DIAK 1&quot;    Tne Cabinet had before them a Note by theTABLEgjjcBo Secretary of State for India, covering a draft of thestatement to be made by the Prime Minister at thecent &apos;at, close of the Indian Round Table Conference.  (CP. 300 (31)Appendix I).      This draft was based upon an earlierimesler&apos;s draft by the Prime Minister, and had been re-submittedsiaent.to him for revision on the 27th November.      It wasIfous circulated to the Cabinet as a provisional draft, inpence;let 82 accordance with the Cabinet Conclusion referred to inCon-loii 2). the margin.The Prime Minister explained that the drafthad not reached him at Chequers in time for him towork on it until late on Saturday, November 28th,      Inconsequence he had not completed his work of revision,as he had hoped, on the 29th, and had been at work on it up to the time of the Gabinet Meeting,     ThePrime Minister&apos;s corrections had necessitated re-typing,and the copy on which he was working was not identical with the copies circulated to the Cabinet.The Cabinet then proceeded to discuss thestatement attached to C.P. 300 (31) paragraph by paragraph.     The principal alterations introducedwere as follows:-Page A.Line 8;- For &quot;under existing conditions&quot;put &quot;in existing conditions&quot; (subsequentlyaltered to &quot;circumstances&quot;.)Lines 10 to 12;- For &quot;the transfer of financial responsibility must necessarily besubject to such conditions as&quot;,put,&quot;, in regard to finance, suchconditions must apply as&quot;,

I proposef therefore,with your consent to nominate indue course a small representativeCommittee - a working Gommittee -of this Conference, which willremain in being in India, withwhich, through the Viceroy, we can keep in effective touch.      I cannothere and now specify precisely how this Gommittee can best be employed.This is a matter which must be worked out and must, to some extent,depend on the reports of the committees which -we propose to set up.

APPENDIX    I.MOST SECRET.CP.   500 (31).CABINET.INDIAN ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE.PR I ME ,TMIN I ST ER&apos;S STATEMENT&apos; AT.Note by the Secretary of State for India0The accompanying draft, based upon an earlierdraft by the Prime Ministers has been rer?submitted to himto-day for revision.      It is now circulated simultaneously to the Cabinet as a provisional draft in accordance with cabinet 82 (31), Conclusion 2 (b),(Intd.)    S.H,ndia Office, S.W.I.,27th November, 1931.
MOST SECRET.Draft Statement to close the RoundTable Conference.We have now had two Sessions of the Round table conference, and the time has come to survey theimportant work which has been done, fipst of all,in setting out the problems which in the task of constitution building we have to surmount, and then in finding the way to surmount them.     The reports presented to us now, bring our consultations to the end of anotherstage, and we must now pause and study what has been done and set going ways and means of bringing our work to a successful end as rapidly as possible.       I regard our discussions and our personal contacts here as of thehighest value, and 1 make bold to say that they have raised the problem of&apos; Indian, constitutional reformfar above the mere technicalities of constitution-making j     for. we have won that confidence in, andrespept for, each other which has made the task one ofco-operation, and that, % am confident, will continueto the end and we shall celebpate our final victorytogether.At the beginning of the year 1.made a declarationof the policy of the then Government, and % amauthorised by the present one to give you and india a specific assurance that it remains their policy.I shall repeat the salient sentences of that declaration:rrl-
&quot;The view of His Majesty&apos;s Government isthat responsibility for the government of india should be placed upon Legislatures, Central and provincial, with such provisions as may be necess-,ary to guarantee, duping a period of transitionthe observance of certain obligations and tomeet other special circumstances? and also w1thsuch guarantees as are required by minorities toprotect their political liberties and rights.In such statutory safeguards as- may bemade for meeting the needs of the transitional,period, it will be a primary eoncern of HisMajesty&apos;&apos;? Government to see that the reserved powers are so framed and exercised as not to prejudice the advance of India through thenew constitution to full responsibility for her own government,&quot;2.     With regard to the Central government i made it plain that subject to carefully definedconditions.,     His Majesty&apos;s Government were preparedto recognise the principle of the responsibility ofthe Executive to the Legislature, if the Legislaturewere constituted on a federal basis.      You will agreethat this implied due representation of both States,and British in Legislature and Executive alike.   Theprinciple of responsibility was to be subject to the qualification that, under existing conditions, the subjects of Defence and External Affairs must be reserved to the Governor-General,  and that the transferof financial responsibility must necessarily be subjectto such conditions as would ensure the fulfilment of
the obligations incurred under the authority of theSecretary of State, and the maintenance unimpairedof the financial stability and credit of India.Finally, it, was our view that the Governor*-Generalmust be granted the necessary powers to enable him to fulfil his responsibility for securing the observance of the constitutional rights of Minorities, and forultimately maintaining the tranquility of the States.I need hardly add that it was our view that therights of the Services were to be securely protected.These were, in broad outline, the features of thenew constitution for India as contemplated by hisMajesty&apos;s Government at the end of the last Conference.As I say, my colleagues in His Majesty&apos;s present government fully accept that statement of January lastas representing their own policy.     In particular they desire to reaffirm their belief in an all-IndiaFederation.as offering the only hopeful solution ofIndia&apos;s constitutional problem.     They intend to pursue this plan unswervingly and to do their utmost to sur-mount the difficulties which now stand in the way of itsrealisation.     In order to place this declaration on a footing which will pjrpve to every one concerned that itis genuinely and sincerely made, this statement which1 am now making to you &quot;fill be circulated at once as a white Paper to both Houses of Parliament and theGovernment will ask Parliament to approve it onWednesday.     Tims it will have the greatest authority which any government pan give to it.The discussions which have been prpceeding duringthe past two months have been of value in shov/ing usmore precisely the problems we have to solve, and have
advanced us towards the solution of some of them.    Butthey have also made it plain that the creation-of a federal constitution for all India will inevitablydemand time for Its accomplishment,      There are s till,many essentials which require further examination, and:negotiation, and we must all take them away at thisstage and ponder over them for later decision.     There&quot;is still difference of opinion, for instance,.- as to the composition and powers of the Federal Legislature,and I regret that owing to the. absence of a settlementof the key question of how to safeguard, the Minoritiesunder a responsible Central, Government,- the Conference-has been unable to discuss, effectively the, nature .of the Federal Executive and its relationship with theLegislature,     Again,, it has not; yet been possiblefor the States to settle amongst themselves their place in the Federation and their mutual relationshipswithin It.     The cause will not be advanced byignoring these facts or by assuming that the difficultiesthey present will somehov/ fgolve themselves-..     further thought, discussion and reconciliation of differentinterests and points of view are s till required before,we can translate broad general aims into the detailedmachinery of a workable constitution.       I am notsaying this to indicate any pause in our work.      .only wish to remind you that we are putting our-hands to a task which demands alike from His Majesty&apos;-sGovernment r-and from the leaders of India opinion care,courage and time, lest when the work is done it maybring confusion and disappointment, and instead of opening the way to progress may effectively bar it.     We
must build like good craftsmen, well and truly;    our duty to India demands that of all of us,What then is the general position in which we find ourselves as regards a practical programme for the advancement of our common aims?     The great idea of all-India Federation still holds the field..      The- principleof a responsible Federal Government, subject to certain,reservations and safeguards, stands unchanged.     And weare all agreed that the Governors* provinces of thefuture are to be responsibly.governed unite, enjoyingthe greatest possible measure of freedom from outsideinterference and dictation in carrying out their ownpolicies in their own sphere.I should explain at once in conneetion with that last point that we contemplate as one feature of thenew order that the North West Frontier Province shouldhe constituted a Governor&apos;s province, of the samestatus as other Governor&apos;s provinces, of the same status-as other Governor&apos;s provinces, but with due regard tothe necessary requirements of the Frontier.      It willalso be essential to secure that, in the. North west frontier Province, as indeed in all other Governor&apos;sprovinces, the powers entrusted to the Governor tosafeguard the safety and tranquility of the provinceshall be real and effective.His Majesty&apos;s Government also accept in principle the proposition which was endorsed at the last conference that- Sind should be constituted a separate province,if satisfactory means of financing it can be found.We therefore intend to ask the Government of India toarrange for a Conference with representatives of Sindfor the purpose of trying to overcome the difficultiesdisclosed by the Report of the expert financialinvestigation which has just been completed.. -5-
But I have digressed from the question of a programme in the light of the accepted factors -Federation as the aim and self-governing provinces and states as its basis.      As I have said, our discussions have made it clear to all of us that Federation cannotbe achieved forthwith.      There is a mass of difficultconstructive work still to be done and there are manyagreements to be sought by which our constructionmust,be shaped and cemented.      It is equally plain that, by contrast with the difficulties and delaysInevitably incidental to Federation, the introductionof responsible government in the provinces would be asimpler task which could be accomplished in a comparatively short space of time.      The adjustments and modifications,of the powers now ejcerelsed by the Central Governmentwhich would obviously have to be made in order to givereal self-government %o the provinces should raise noinsuperable difficulties.     His Majesty&apos;? Government are convinced that the surest and speediest route to Federationwould be fio get these measures in train forthwith, and notto delay the assumption of full responsibility by theprovinces a day longer than is necessary.     But the events of the past few days have made it clear that that viewdoes not commend itself to you0      You have indicatedwith no uncertain voice your desire that no. change shouldbe made in the Constitution which is not effected by oneall-embracing Statute covering the whole field, and HisMajesty&apos;? Government have no intention of forcing uponyou a responsibility which, for whatever reasons,, youconsider at the moment premature.      It may he that opinion and circumstances will change, and it is not necessary here and
now to take any irrevocable de-cision.      But. T&quot; wish, &quot;to makeit plain that His Majesty&apos;s Government would in no circumstances take any concrete action towards the intro-duction of responsible government in the provinces in ad-vance of Federation without full consultation with indian opinion as expressed in the Legislatures, and through the agency of this Conference working in the way I shallpresently describe.     It would clearly be indefensible,however, to allow this conclusion to stand in the way of constitutional advance in the North West Frontier Province.We intend therefore to take the necessary steps as soon asmay &quot;be to apply the provisions of the present Act relating to governor&apos;s provinces to the North West Frontier Province.12.      The air has been thick with rumours of late thatour policy was in real intention confined to the Provinces.There was never any ground for this misrepresentation.     we intend, and have always intended, to press on with allpossible despatch with the federal plan013.      We must all, however, realise that there stands in the way of progress, whether for the provinces or theCentre, that formidable obstacle - the communal deadlock.I have never concealed from you my conviction that this isabove all others a problem for you to settle by agreementamongst yourselves.      The first of the privileges and the burdens of responsible government is to agree amongstyourselves as to how these are to be shareds    this Con-ference has twice essayed this task,    twice it has failed.I cannot believe that you will demand that we shall accept these failures as final and conclusive.
But time presses.     We intend to pursue our task and the time cannot he long delayed when we shall find that our endeavours to proceed with our plans are held upif you cannot present us with a settlement acceptable toall parties as the foundations upon which to build.      Inthat event His Majestyrs Government would he forced totake the matter into their own hands, for, they are determined that even this disability shall not be permitted to be a bar to progress.      This would mean that His Majesty&apos;s Government would have to determinefor you not only your electoral problems and yourproblems of representation, but alsp to decide as wiselyand justly as possible what checks and balances theConstitution is to contain to protect minorities fromthe free play of the democratic principle.      such provisions could work satisfactorily only on onecondition - that though they may be printed in the sections of an Act they never in practice have to becalled into play: and that condition could be fulfilledonly if they were based upon the common consent of all theinterests involved,      I beg   you to bring that about.So we intend to go ahead.      But the termination ofthis session of the Conference does not mean thetermination of the Conference method - of proceeding by consultation with the object of obtaining thegreatest measure of agreement.      But ^iany and difficultas are the problems which the Conference has leftunsolved or has not yet even discussed, and great a shave been the advantages of this Conference for poolingand sorting out general ideas, I think few of you willdisagree with me when I say that we have reached a
stage when real progress can he achieved only by asmall body dealing with concrete and defined issues.I proposed therefore with your consent to nominatein due course a small representative Committee -a working Committee - pf this Conference whichwill remain in being in India, with which, throughthe Viceroy, we can keep in effective touch.I cannot here and now specify precisely how thisCommittee can best be employed - this is a matter which   .must be worked out, but one obvious task which would fall upon it would be to assist us in examining theproposals of the Committees which will provide us muchof the material for our future progress,It is our intention to set up at once theCpmmittees whose appointment the Conference has recommended:    (a) to investigate and advise on the revision of the Franchise and constituencies,    (b)to put to the test of detailed budgetary facts and figures the recommendations of the Federal Financesub-Committee and (c) to explore more fully the specific financial problems arising in connection withcertain individual States.      We intend that these committees shall be at work in India under theChairmanship of distinguished public men from thiscountry as early in the New Year as possible.      The views expressed by you here on the other outstanding Federalproblems will be taken into consideration at. once andthe necessary steps taken to get better understanding and agreement upon them.In addition to these specific activities, HisMajesty&apos;s Government have taken note of the suggestion made in paragraph 26 of the Federal StructureCommittee&apos;s last Report with the ohject of facilitating
an early decision on the States quota in theLegislature and its distribution between the Statesinter se.      It follows from what I have already saidthat they share the general desire that an early settlement of these questions by the States to their mutual satisfaction is of the highest importancesand His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to afford the princes       all possible assistance by way of advice in this matter, and if they find agreement amongstthemselves impossible within the time suggestedby the Committee, the Government will take such steps as seem appropriate to obtain a working-settlement.

INDIAN ROUND TABLE CONFERENCE,7th September-1st December 1931.Statement made by the Prime Minister tothe Conference at the close of its second session, 1st December 1931.1. We have now bad two sessions of the Round table conference, and the time has come to survey the importantwork which has been done, first of all, in setting out theproblems which in the task of Indian constitution-building wehave to surmount, and then in trying to find how.to surmountthem. The reports presented to us now bring our co-operation to the end of another stage, and we must pause and study what has been done and the obstacles which we have encountered,and the best ways and means of bringing our work to a successful end. as rapidly as possible. I. regard our discussions and our personal contacts here as of the highest value, and make bold to say that they have raised the problem of Indianconstitutional reform far above the mere technicalities of con-stitution-making ; for we have won that confidence in, andrespect for, each other which has made the task one of helpfulpolitical co-operation. That, 1 am confident, will continue tothe end.   By co-operation alone can we succeed.2. At the beginning of the year I made a declaration of thepolicy of the then Government, and 1 am authorised by thepresent one to give you and India a specific assurance that it remains their policy. I shall repeat the salient sentences ofthat declaration :-&quot; The view of His Majesty&apos;s Government is that responsi-bility for the government of India should be placed uponLegislatures, Central and Provincial, with such provisionsas may be necessary to guarantee, during a period of transition, the observance of certain obligations and tomeet other special circumstances, and also with suchguarantees as are required by minorities to protect their political liberties and rights.&quot; In such statutory safeguards as may be made for meeting the needs of the transitional period, it will be a primary concern of His Majesty&apos;s Government to see thatthe reserved powers are so framed and exercised as not to prejudice the advance of India through the new constitution to full responsibility for her own government.&quot;3. With regard to the Central Government, I made it plain that, subject to defined conditions, His Majesty&apos;s late Governmentwere prepared to recognise the principle of the responsibility
of the Executive to the Legislature, if both were constitutedon an all-India federal basis. The principle of responsibilitywas to be subject to the qualification that, in existing circum-stances, Defence and External Affairs must be reserved to theGovernor-General, and that, in regard to finance such conditions must appby as would ensure the fulfilment of the obligationsincurred under the authority of the Secretaiy of State, and themaintenance unimpaired of the financial stability and credit ofIndia.4. Finally, it was our view that the Governor-General mustbe granted the necessary powers to enable him to fulfil his responsibility for securing the observance of the constitutionalrights of Minorities, and for ultimately maintaining the tran-quillity of the State.5. These were, in broad outline, the features of the newconstitution for India as contemplated by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment at the end of the last Conference.6. As I say, my colleagues in His Majesty&apos;s present Governmentfully accept that statement of January last as representing theirown policy. In particular, they desire to reaffirm their belief in an all-India Federation as offering the only hopeful solutionof India&apos;s constitutional problem. They intend to pursue this plan unswervingly and to do their utmost to surmount thedifficulties which now stand in the way of its realisation. Inorder to give this declaration the fullest authority, the statementwliich I am now making to you will be circulated to-day as a white Paper to both Houses of Parliament, and the Governmentwill ask Parliament to approve it this week.     .7. The discussions which have been proceeding during thepast two months have been of value in showing us more precisely the problems we. have to solve, and have advancedus towards the solution of some of them. But they have also made it plain that others still require further examination andco-operative consideration. There is still difference of opinion,for instance, as to the composition and powers of the federal legislature, and I regret that owing to the absence of a settle-ment of the key question of how to safeguard the Minoritiesunder a responsible Central Government, the Conference hasbeen unable to discuss effectively the nature of the FederalExecutive and its relationship with the Legislature. Again,it has not yet been possible for the States to settle amongstthemselves their place in the Federation and their mutualrelationships within it. Our common purpose will not be advanced by ignoring these facts, nor by assuming that thedifficulties they present will somehow solve themselves. further thought, discussion and reconciliation of different interests and
points of view are still required before we can translate broadgeneral aims into the detailed machinery of a workable .con-stitution. I am not saying this to indicate impossibility, nor,toforeshadow any pause in our work. I only wish to remind you that we have put our hands to a task which demands alikefrom His Majesty&apos;s Government and from the leaders of indian opinion care, courage and time, lest when the work is done itmay bring confusion and disappointment, and instead of opening the way to political progress may effectively bar it. We mustbuild like good craftsmen, well and truly; our duty to Indiademands that from all of us. ......8. What then is the general position in which .we find ourselves as regards a practical programme for the advance-ment of our common aims ? I want no more general declarationswhich carry us no further in our work. The declarationsalready made and repeated to-day are enough to give confidence in the purpose of the Government and to provide work for theCommittees to which I shall refer. . I want to keep to business,The great idea of All-India Federation still holds the field.The principle of a responsible Federal Government, subject tocertain reservations and safeguards through a transition period,remains unchanged. And we are all agreed that the Governors&apos;Provinces of the future are to be responsibly governed units,enjoying the greatest possible measure of freedom from outsideinterference and dictation in carrying out their own policies intheir own sphere.9. I should explain at once in connection with that last point that we contemplate as one feature of the new orderthat the North-West Frontier Province should be constituted a Governors Province, of the same status as other Governors&apos;Provinces, but with due regard to the necessary requirementsof the Frontier, and that, as in all other Governors&apos; Provinces,the powers entrusted to the Governor to safeguard the safety and tranquillity of the Province shall be real and effective.10. His Majesty&apos;s Government also accept in principle the proposition which was endorsed at the last Conference that Sindshould be constituted a separate Province, if satisfactory meansof financing it can he found. We therefore intend to ask theGovernment of India to arrange for a Conference with represen-tatives of Sind for the purpose of trying to overcome thedifficulties disclosed by the report of the expert financialinvestigation which has just been completed.11. But I have digressed from the question of a programme in the light of the accepted factors Federation as the aim and self-governing Provinces and the Indian States as its basis. AsI have said, our discussions have made it clear to all of us that
sFederation cannot be achieved in a month or two. There is amass of difficult constructive work still to be done, and there are important agreements to be sought by which the structure mustbe shaped and cemented. It is eqtially plain that the framing of a scheme of responsible government for the Provinces wouldbe a-simpler task which could, be more speedily accomplished.The adjustments and modifications of the powers now exercised by the Central Government which Would obviously have&apos; tobe made in order to give real self-government to the Provincesshould raise no insuperable difficulties. It has, therefore,been pressed upon the Government that the surest and speediestroute to Federation would be to get these measures in trainforthwith, and not to delay the assumption of full responsi-bility by the Provinces a day longer than is necessary. Butit is clear that a partial advance does not commend itself, toyou. You have indicated your desire that no change shouldbe made in the Constitution which is not effected hy one&apos; all-embracing Statute covering the whole field, and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have no intention of urging a responsibility which,for whatever reasons, is considered at the moment prematureor ill-advised. It may be that opinion and circumstances willchange, and it is not necessary here and. now to take anyirrevocable decision. We intend, and have always intended,to press on with all possible despatch with the federal plan.It would clearly be indefensible, however, to allow the presentdecision to stand in the way of the earliest possible consfitu-tional advance in the North-West Frontier Province. we intend, therefore, to take the necessary steps as soon as maybe to apply to the North-West Frontier Province, until thenew constitutions are established, the provisions of the present act relating to Governors&apos; Provinces.12. We must all, however, realise that there stands in theway of progress, whether for the Provinces or the; Centre, thatformidable obstacle, the communal deadlock. I have neverconcealed from you my conviction that this is above, all othersa problem for you to settle by agreement amongst yourselves.The first of the privileges and the burdens of a self-governingpeople is to agree how the democratic principle of represen-tation is to be applied or, in other words, who are to berepresented and how it is to be done. This Conference hastwice essayed this task : twice it has failed. I cannot believethat you will demand that we shall accept these failures asfinal and conclusive.18. But time presses. We shall, soon find that our endeavours to proceed with our plans are held up (indeed they havebeen held up already) if you cannot present us with a settle-menfc acceptable to all parties as the foundations upon which to build.   In that event His Majesty&apos;s Government would be
compelled to apply a provisional scheme, for they are deter-,mined that even this disability shall not be permitted to be abar to progress. This would mean that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-nient would have to settle for you, not only your problemsof representation, but also to decide as wisely and justly .as possible what checks and balances the Constitution isto contain to protect minorities from an unrestricted andtyrannical use of the democratic principle expressing itselfsolely through majority power. I. desire to warn you thatif the Government have to supply even temporarily thispart of your Constitution which you are unable to supply for yourselves, and though it will be our care to providethe most ample safeguards for minorities so that none ofthem need feel that they have been neglected, it will not ibe a satisfactory way of dealing with this problem. let me also warn you that if you cannot come, to an agreement on this amongst yourselves, it will add considerably to thedifficulties, of any Government here which shares our viewsof an Indian Constitution, and it will detract from the placewhich that Constitution will occupy amongst those of other nations. I therefore beg of you once more to . take furtheropportunities to meet together and present us with an 1agreement..14. We intend to go ahead.   We have now brought our  I-business down to specific problems which require close andintimate consideration, first of all by bodies which are reallycommittees and  not  unwieldy conferences,  and   we  must  I now set up machinery to do this kind of work.   As thatis being done and conclusions presented, we must be able Jto continue consultations with you.   I propose, therefore, with  Iyour consent, to nominate in due course a small representative committee I-a working Committee of this Conference which i will remain in being in India, with which, through the Viceroy,we can keep in effective touch.   I cannot here and now specify 1precisely how this Committee can best he employed.  This is a jmatter which must be worked out and must to some extent Idepend on the reports of the Committees we propose to set hp.But in the end, we shall have to meet again for a final reviewof the whole scheme.15. It is our intention to set up at once the Committees whoseappointment the Conference has recommended : (a) to investigate Band advise on the revision of the Franchise and constituencies: &apos;(b) to put to the test of detailed budgetary facts and figures the I -recommendations of the Federal Finance Sub-Committee ; and I(e) to explore more fully the specific financial problems arising Iin   connection   with   certain individual States.   We intendthat these Committees shall be at work in India under thechairmanship of distinguished public men from this country as
early in the New Year as possible. The views expressed hy yonhere on the other outstanding Federal problems will he takeninto consideration at once, and the necessary steps taken to getbetter understanding and agreement upon them.16. His Majesty&apos;s Government have also- taken note of thesnggestioii made in para. 26 of the Federal Structure Com-&apos;mittee&apos;s Third Report, with the object of facilitating an early decision on the distribution among the States of whatever quotamay be agreed upon for their representation in the Legislature.It follows from what I have already said that they share thegeneral desire for an early agreement on this question amongthe States, and His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to afford the princes all possible assistance by way of advice in this matter.If it appears to the Government that there is likely to be undue delay in their reaching agreement amongst themselves, theGovernment will take such steps as seem helpful to obtain a working settlement.17.1 have already alluded to another matter to which you havegiven ample evidence that you attach great importance, and towhich you will expect me to refer.   A decision of the communalproblem which provides only for representation of the com-munitiesin the Legislatures is not enough to secure what I may call &quot; natural rights.&quot;   When such provisions have been made,minorities will still remain minorities, and the Constitution must therefore contain provisions which will give all creeds and classesa due sense of security that the principle of majority governmentis not to he employed to their moral or material disadvantage in the body politic.   The Government cannot undertake here and now to specify in detail what those provisions should be.Their form and scope will need the most anxious and carefulconsideration with a view to ensuring on the one hand that theyare reasonably adequate for their purpose, and on the other thatthey do not encroach, to an extent which amounts to stultifi-cation,   xipon   the  principles  of   representative  responsible government.   In this matter the Committee of Consultationshould play an important part, for, here also, just as in regardto the method and proportions of electoral representation, itis vital to the success of the new Constitution that it should be framed on a basis of mutual agreement.18. Now, once again we must bid each other good-lrye. Greatstrides have been made, greater, I am sure you will find, thanthe most optimistic think. I was glad to hear in the course ofthese debates speaker after speaker taking that view. It isthe true view. We have met with obstacles, hut one of thoseoptimists to whom humanity owes most of its progress saidthat &quot; obstacles were made to be overcome.&quot; In that buoyancyof spirit and the goodwill which comes, from it,, let us go on
with our task. My fairly wide experience of. Conferences like this is that the rojad to agreements is very broken and litteredwith obstructions to begin with, and the first stages often fillone with despair. But quite suddenly, and generally unexpired-pectedly, the way smoothes itself out and the end is happilyi-reached. I not only pray that such may be&apos;our experience,but 1 assure you that the,Government will strive unceasinglyto secure such a successful termination to our mutual labours.(496)  Pa, 32426  Wfc. 18931-1035      J000   J2.31   [T.O.P.]
