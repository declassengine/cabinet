THE ottawa conference,(previous reference:Cabinet 81.(SI), Con-conclusion ion 7 .)f.R.1, The Cabinet had been summoned mainly forconsideration of Government Policy at the indian round-Table Conference, and time did not permit ofdiscussion of the Report of the Cabinet Committeeon the Ottawa Conference (CP.-288 (31)).   TheSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs, however,was given an opportunity at the outset of theMeeting for some brief introductory remarks, inconsequence of which the Cabinet agreed ?-t-That the question of the ottawa conference should be placed firston the Agenda Paper (after &quot;ForeignAffairs&quot;) at the Meeting of theCabinet to be held on Wednesday,December 2, 1931.-1-
-THE indian round-table conference.government policy at.(previous references:Cabinet 81(51), Oon-clusion 2,and cabinet 80(31), Con-clusion 1.)2. The Secretary of State for India recalled that at the Meeting held on November 20th (Cabinet80 (31), Conclusion 1) the Cabinet had reaffirmedtheir previous decision (Cabinet 77 (31), conclusion) to introduce legislation providing for provincial autonomy during the.present Session of Parliamentwhile proceeding with all the work necessary tocomplete an All-India Federation Constitution.    Since,that decision was taken, fresh developments had occurred.   At that time several sections of theIndian Round-Table Conference, more especially the minorities, had intimated that they were preparedto s&apos;upport a policy of proceeding at once withprovincial autonomy and to announce this at theRoundr-Table Conference.   At that time, also, theGovernment of India had been in favour of theCabinet&apos;s policy.    Subsequently, as a consequenceof an active propaganda, both in the Press and inthe Round-Table Conference, the promised support to the plan of proceeding first with provincial autonomy had been withdrawn.   After two days debate the Aga Khan, the Leader of the Mohammedan Delega-ition (who two days before had informed the Secretaryof State, in the presence of the Lord Chancellor,      ..that he supported the Cabinet&apos;s policy) had on theprevious day declared that the Mohammedans preferredan advance by one stage instead of two.   The viceroy of India would have preferred the introductionwithin the next few months of a comprehensive Billto include All-India Federation, but at the momentthis was.quite impracticable:    the material for sucha Bill was.not available.   When asked to choose between the postponement of all legislation until
such time as a comprehensive scheme could beproduced,and proceeding with provincial autonomyas an instalment, he had preferred the formeralternative.   All the Indian groups at the Rpund-Table Conference, though warned that a delay possiblyof years might be involved, preferred tp await a comprehensive scheme.    In addition, the Secretaryof State gave reasons of practical politics, arisingout of the situation in India as well as in Parlia-ment, which rendered it difficult now to carry outthe Cabinet&apos;s policy.   To attempt to do so,he pointed out, would be repre-sented as a breach of the Government&apos;s undertaking to proceed as far as possible in accord with indian opinion.While recognising, for the above reasons, thatit was no longer possible to proceed on the linesof the previous decision, the Secretary of Stateemphasised the importance of not closing the door,in any announcement that was to be made, to the plan of beginning with provincial autonomy.   The working out of a scheme of All-India Federation was bound tobe beset with great difficulties, the surmounting ofwhich might require more time than was at presentrealised.    It was possible that the best Indian opinion might revert to the scheme that was now rejected,more particularly as provincial opinion was notstrongly represented in the Round-rTable Conference.The Secretary of State then recalled the cabinet decision that if the various sections in India hadnot been able to reach a Communal settlement among themselves by a date early in the New Year to be specified, the Government would themselves have totake certain decisions as the basis of the Bill
(Cabinet 80 (31), Conclusion 1(c)).    In the new circumstances, he pointed out, it would be undesir-able in the Prime Minis ter\s statement to tie theGovernment down to do this at any early date.   Thematter could not be delayed indefinitely, but he was advised that it would be best to allow some months to elapse before taking any decision.Notwithstanding the change in policy now contemplated, the Secretary of State asked thatthe Prime Minister would include in his declarationthe following formula, approved by the Cabinet forthe North-West Frontier Province (Cabinet 80 (31),Conclusion l(d)):-&quot;The North-West Frontier Provinceshould be constituted a Governor&apos;?Province, of the same status as other Governors&apos; Provinces, due regard being had to the necessaryrequirements of the Frontier,   Itis intended, of course, that in theNorth-West Frontier Province, as- indeed in all other Governors&apos;Provinces, the powers entrusted tothe Governor to safeguard the safety and tranquility&apos; of the Provinceshall be real and effective.&quot;His policy in this matter was to proceed as far aspossible in the direction of provincial autonomyfor the Nerth-rWest Frontier Province by means of devolution, without involving legislation.Finally, the Secretary of State emphasised once more that in his view the Cabinet &apos;s   plan&apos; of proeeed-ing by provincial autonomy first was the right course and the quickest: means of reaching the goal ofAll-India Federation,    In rejecting it the Indianshad, he thought, made a mistake.    The goal ofAll-India Federation might now be more difficultof attainment,    In view of the many difficulties that still remained to be surmounted.,, he urged the
-utmost caution in any public statement as to how soon or by what method Federation at the Centrecould be achieved.The Lord Chancellor, who had spent the whole weekpresiding at the Federal Structure Committee of the round-Table Conference, impressed on the Cabinet thedifficulty of inducing Indians to believe in our good faith .   Their attitude was that we would make vaguepromises and go no further.   He agreed with theSecretary of State that it was impossible to go on with the policy of provincial autonomy first, withAll-India Federation to follow, tmless the Indianscould be convinced that the Government would allowreal autonomy in the Provinces and really intended tofollow this up with Federation,   He illustrated thisby accounts of conversations with prominent IndianDelegates .   He reported also that on the previous evening Lord Irwin had recounted to him a conversation he had just had with Mr Gandhi.    The latter had saidthat he would still favour procedure by givingprovincial autonomy first if he were assured that theProvinces would have control of Land Revenue, LiquorTaxes and Salt.    Lord Irwin had pointed out that theCentral Government would require some revenue, andthat for this purpose Salt was essential.   Mr Gandhihad conceded this point and had aaid that he wouldbe satisfied if the Provinces were to have land revenue and.Liquor Control.The Cabinet were informed that every scheme for provincial autonomy provided for this.   They were reminded that Mr Gandhi had more than once changedhis opinions at short notice.In the course of the discussion which followed,the Cabinet were warned against the danger of any statement that could later on be exploited by
politicians in India as a moral undertaking tointroduce and carry a scheme of Federation when theIndian Round-Table Conference had failed so far toproduce the essential elements of a scheme.Great regret was expressed that the Cabinetfspolicy was not acceptable to Indian opinion, since it was suggested that until Indians had had responsi-bility for law and order, such as would fall upon them under any scheme of provincial autonomy, theywould never realise the gravity of the practical problems of government that would confront them.The difficulties of devising a Federal Constitutionbefore the constituent elements frpm which it wasto be formed had been brought into existence wereemphasised.The question was. raised whether it would not be feasible, if not to produce a complete Constitution,at any rate to present the general scheme of anAll-India Federation within twelve months.    TheCabinet were reminded, however, that essentialfactors in the scheme lay outside the control of theGovernment:    for example, the attitude of the IndianPrinces.    Emphasis was placed on the importance of proceeding without delay with the setting up inIndia of the various enquiries necessary to complete the comprehensive scheme now contemplated, and of adding as much prestige as possible to these enquiriesby the appointment to them of persons of high standing and authority.    The Cabinet were informed that theCommittees engaged on these enquiries would bedealing with subjects selected by the Round-table conference itself,
The Prime Minister thought that the cabinet would find that the various points raised in thediscussion were dealt with in the draft of his statement to be made at the close of the Conference.In the new circumstances the difficulty was to steerbetween a definiteness which it might be impossibleto fulfil, and a vagueness as to the time requiredfor drawing up a scheme, which would cast doubtson our sincerity.   He proposed, therefore, in substance to reproduce a good deal of the statement the had made at the close of the previous Sessionof the Indian Round-Table Conference on January 19,19 31.   He agreed with the Secretary of State as tothe importance of postponing for the present anyattempt by the British Government to settle provi-provisionally the Communal difficulty.   He also agreed with his proposals as to the North-West frontier province, but he asked the Secretary of State tomake further enquiries as to whether he could makea sufficient advance in this direction without legislation.   He thought it advisable in his state-ment to make some mention of Sind , in which theSecretary of State for India agreed.   He also proposed to give pledges on the subject of the setting up of the Committees of Enquiry.The Cabinet agreed . (a) That^ in view of the new conditionsreported to them by the Secretary ofState for India and the Lord Chancellor,it was impossible to proceed at once with a Provincial Autonomy Bill inaccordance with their previous decision.They agreed, however, that care shouldbe taken not finally to close the doorto a policy of proceeding first withprovincial autonomy in case at some later date it should be deemeddesirable:(b) ^at the Secretary of State for india should at once (and without awaiting the Prime Ministers comments)
circulate to the Cabinet the draftof the declaration he had in courseof preparation as a basis of thePrime Minister&apos;s statement at theconclusion of the Indian Round-TableC conference:(c) That the Secretary should circulateat once to the Cabinet the text ofthe Prime Minister&apos;s statement atthe Round-Table Conference onJanuary 19, 1931 (Cmd.3772, p.80):(d) That a Special Meeting of the cabinet for consideration of the Prime Minister&apos;declaration should be held in the PrimeMinister&apos;s Room at the -House of commons on MONDAY, NOVEMBER 30 th,  at 9p.m.(subsequently altered to Q-15 p.m.)Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,November 27, 1931,
