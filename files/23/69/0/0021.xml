267&apos; &apos;flogpABATlOITSD WARBTS.(previous reference:Cabinet 91(31),,  Oon-clusaon 3(c) .)FX.1. The Cabinet had before them a Most secret draft reply (CP .-338 (31)) to the French Memorandumon Reparations (See CP.-310 (51))Tas approved bythe Cabinet Committee on Reparations and War Debtsat their meeting on December 15th.   This draft had only been circulated late on the previous evening.The draft reply was discussed in considerable detail from paragraph 6 onwards ,Consideration was given to the question of whetherparagraph 10 should not be amended in order to bring out even more strongly the incorrectness of theassumption, so widely held in France   that Britishcredits to Germany were granted at a high rate ofinterest out of money borrowed at a low rate.. To thisend it was suggested that extracts from the recentletter from the British Bankers&apos; Association andthe Accepting Houses Committees of the Governor ofthe Bank of England (C.P.-306 (31)) dated November30th, 1931, might appear either in the paragraphitself or in an Appendix,    Qn the whole^ however,the Cabinet felt that it wouldbe better to keepthis material for use at a later stage-, perhapsduring the forthcoming Conference.The Cabinet approved the Memorandum, subject toa number of detailed alterations in paragraphs 6to 10, which, without changing the substance, were for the most part designed to soften some of thephras ing,A copy of the Memorandum, as approvedby the Cabinet,  is attached as an Appendix,
t?jd TAN IS Am IONOP TFF; INDIANfCAppointmentof IndianCadets toSapper andMiner Com-panies .(previous reference:Cabinet 40(31), Con-clusion 6.)2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for India (CP.-313 (31).)on the subject of the eligibility of Indian Cadetsfor appointment to Sapper and Miner companies.    Inthe Memorandum, it was stated that it had been provisionally agreed, in consultation with the WarOffice and the Government of India, that an IndianCadet at Woolwich may suitably be regarded aseligible for appointment to the Indian      . Sappersand Miners, provided that he has obtained 70 percent. of the aggregate marks obtainable throughoutthe Royal Military Academy course in both Mathematicsand Science, and that he is specially recommendedby the Commandant as likely both to benefit fromthe postgraduate course at the School of MilitaryEngineering and to take the required- Science Degree .The Secretary of State did not ask the Cabinetto stereotype this agreement, but to lay down as ageneral principle that special conditions should be prescribed by the Secretary of State for India, inconsultation with the War Office and the Governmentof India, in regard to the eligibility of IndianCadets at Woolwich for appointment to Sapper andMiner companies.The Cabinet approved the latterproposal.
aterritoriality   the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(CP.-320 (31)) covering a Memorandum by the Foreign(previous reference: Office on the Extraterritoriality negotiations with cabinet 87(31), Con-        China;    a copy of the draft Extraterritorialityelusion 4.)- . Treaty and related documents;    as well as a draft telegram to Nanking.    ,In this draft telegram itwas proposed to adopt the attitude that the questionwhether His Majesty&apos;s Government are or are notprepared to sign the draft Treaty, or any similarquestion, cannot arise until negotiations have beenactually resumed, which cannot take place for some considerable time.    &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government have carried their negotiations to the furthest possiblepoint, and the whole question must therefore remainin abeyance until negotiations with other powers have made similar progress and until there seemssome probability that China will be able to implementany Treaty that may result from such negotiations&quot;.That was to be the line if the Chinese Ministerfor Foreign Affairs approached Sir Miles Lampsonagain, but the latter was to avoid taking any initiative.   The draft telegram also made clearthat His Majesty&apos;s Government would prefer entirely to ignore the Mandate issued by the Chinese onMay 4th decreeing the unilateral abolition ofextraterritoriality on January 1, 1932, and did not therefore demand its rescission.   But they wouldtake a most serious view of any attempt by theChinese Government or by any misguided local official-to enforce the Mandate on January 1st, or, indeed,at any time before the negotiations on the subjectof extraterritoriality had been brought to a satis-factory conclusion and an agreement had come intoforce.   Any such attempt would be firmly resisted.-3-
The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs warned the Cabinet that the postponement of extra-territoriality negotiations might conceivably befollowed later on by developments in China calling for serious decisions,,   If China should make, orrevealed, a definite intention to make, a unilateralproclamation of neutrality, his idea was to enterInto communication with other Powers interested,such as the United States of America and Japan..On the understanding that the Cabinet were inno way committed to the draft Extraterritoriality-Treaty, the Cabinet agreed tt(a) To approve the draft telegramattached to the Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (CP.-320 (31)):- (b) To take note that the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs would consider the desirability of makinga communication on the subject ofthe telegram to the Governments ofthe United States of America and japan *&apos;
THE model treaty TO(^strengthen the MEANS OPPREVENTINGWAR.,(previous reference:Cabinet 40(31),  Con-clusion SO-,)f.R.4.The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the Model Treaty to strengthen the Means of Preventing War:-An Extract from the draft Minutesof the 254th Meeting of the Committeeof Imperial Defence, held on December7th, 1931 (CUP,-312 (31)) covering a Memorandum by the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee (C.I.D.-1067-B) con-taining a. recommendation that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should not commit themselves to the model treaty, &quot;which might result in theimposition of unacceptable andharmful conditions and might inter-fere with and impede the executionof legitimate action for the purposeof maintaining peace and safeguardingBritish interests&quot;:A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (CP.-319(31)), covering a Note by theForeign Office and observations bySir William Malkin on the Report of   .the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.In his covering Note the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs deprecateda Cabinet decision at this time againstsigning this Convention,   If France -andGermany signed, and we did not, the role of Britain at the DisarmamentConference would, he pointed out^become more difficult than ever.If the decision was for signature,he suggested that we should onlyratify along with other Powers andshould make the reservation that ourassent depends on the coming intoforce of a general Disarmament Con-vent ion .The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read to the Cabinet telegrams indicating that germany was likely to sign the Model Treaty within the nextfew days, and that France intended to sign it beforethe meeting of the Disarmament Conference.As the Memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs (CP.-319 (31)) had only been circu-lated late on the previous evening and there had notbeen any opportunity for the Chiefs of Staff toadvise their respective Ministers on the observations,dated December 8th, by Sir William Malkin, the cabinet agreed -
To postpone consideration of thequestion until the first meeting in the New Year.(NOTE;    The Secretary of State forForeign Affairs asked thatany observations by theDefence Departments or theChiefs of Staff committee might be communicated to theForeign Office in advance ofthe Meeting-)
Report of the Gabinet Gommittee on the ProposedImperial Economic Conference at Ottawa (C.P. 324 (31))the recommendations of which were summed up in thelast paragraph as follows5-(a) To approve the list of commodities inthe table in paragraph 2 in theReport as commodities on which tariff concessions might be granted by theUnited Kingdom to the Dominions inreturn for an adequate quid pro quoon the part of the Dominions concerned.(b) To approve the general principle thattariff concessions to Dominions may incertain circumstances take the formnot of free entry for a commodity intothe United Kingdom, but of a rate of duty on that commodity more favourable than the rate -charged to any foreign country.     In other words, it may incertain events be appropriate to contemplate a tariff with three ratesof duty., namely,  the general rate, amost-favoured-nation rate, and an empire preferential rate.On the clear understanding that no minister was committed in principle or in detail to a tax on foodstuffs of any kind, and. that any decisionon this subject was reserved until information was before the Cabinet as to what advantages toBritish trade the Dominions were prepared to offer,the Cabinet agreed -(a) To take note of the Report of the .Cabinet Committee (C,P.-S24 (31)):(b) To invite the Committee to discussthe position with&apos;the representativeswhom the Dominions had been invitedto nominate, and to report to theCabinet their impressions as tothe prospects of an arrangement with the Dominions ,-
6,   The Secretary of State for the Coloniesrecalled that at the Meeting of the Cabinet referredto in the margin, he had indicated that the controlof the proposed restriction scheme would be carriedout by Governments, but that in addition therewould be an Advisory Committee.   British and Dutchinterests had been consulted and were favourable to the Cabinet^s idea of having an American manu-facturer on the Advisory Committee-The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs asked that, so far as possible, the discussions sta..with the Dutch representatives should be keptconfidential, and that no announcement should bemade until the discussions on War Debts, as affectingthe United States of America, had been concluded.The Secretary of State for the Colonies undertook to do his best to secure these conditions..Subject to the above, the cabinet approved the proposals for inter-national rubber restriction setforth in CP .-318 (31).
the chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs,  (CP. 2J1  (31)), drawing attention to the. difficult financial position of new foundland.     Details were given to show that,failing assistance, the Newfoundland Government woulddefault on its public debt on the 1st January nextand again on the 1st July, 1932.     While it was admitted that failure of   &apos;-   Dominion Governmentto meet its obligations, particularly in respect of trustee Securities, would have a serious effect onEmpire credit generally, it was pointed out thatto assume obligations towards Newfoundland in the face of similar contingencies threatening fromother directions might   constitute a truly formidableprecedent.      It was therefore proposed in theit must be left to memorandum thai/the Government of Newfoundland tqseek assistance if they can elsewhere, e*g,, fromthe Bank of Montreal and the Canadian Government,and an indication was given in the last paragraphof a possible basis on which agreement might bereached with the Canadian Banks,      The Governor of new foundland had already been advised of the general attitude of His MadestyTs Goveamment in the UnitedKingdom, and there appeared to be no further action which the latter Government could usefullytake at this stage.The Cabinet approved the line ofaction it was proposed to.take,as set forth in CP.-321 (31) and summarised above, and invited theSecretary of State for DominionAffairs to send a full and formaldespatch to the Government of new foundland, setting out themain considerations in his Memo-randum.
PROPOSEDTRADE DELE-GAT ION TOINDIA.(previous reference:Cabinet 89(31), Con-conclusion ion 10.)8,   The Secretary of State for India informed the Cabinet that the Lancashire industries and representatives of Lancashire constituencies inParliament were most anxious that a Trade Delega-tion   should be sent to India.   He stated, that thePresident of the Board of Trade supported theproposal.   The obvious criticism would be that itwas useless to send a Delegation when a boycottwas about to start.   He had no certainty, however,as to whether a boycott would be started or not.He therefore asked approval to the principle of sending a Trade Delegation, which would cost 6,000 to  7,000.   The next stage would be tocommunicate with the Government of India, whowould, no doubt, in their reply make clear theposition as to a boycott.    This would influence the final decision as to sending a Delegation.The Cabinet were informed that the Department of overseas Trade had a sum of  10,000 to surrender to the Treasury.    It was proposed that part of this sum should be used for the purposes of the proposedTrade Delegation, instead of asking for a Supple-mentary Vote.The Cabinet agreed -Subject to the approval of theChancellor of the Exchequer(who had not yet been consulted),to approve the principle of a trade. Delegation to India.
9. The Cabinet had before them a Note by theHome Secretary (C.P.-314 (31)) covering a Memorandumby Mr Oliver Stanley on the subject of the SundayPerformances Bill..  In this Memorandum four possible courses of action were diseussed:-(i) To extend the existing Act for ashort period if it is felt therewould be no Parliamentary opportunity--nity for discussion this yearr-(ii) To allow the present Act to, expirewithout introducing any further legislation:(iii) To deal comprehensively with theproblem of Sunday Entertainment:(iv) To introduce a Bill on the linesof Mr Clynes&apos; Bill of 1931.If the latter course were adopted, it was urgedthat priority should be given to the Bill, in orderto. avoid the risk of failure to pass the committee stage before the close of the Session.The Cabinet agreed --. (a) That the Home Secretary should prepare a Bill on the lines ofMr Clynes&apos; Bill of 1931, asamended in the Committee.Stage:(b) That the Bill should be intro-duced as a Government measure,but should not be supportedby the Government whip.-llr,
HOME-PRODUCED        10. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byMEAT AND BREADFOR THE FORCES, the Secretary of State for War (CP.-323 (31))recalling-that the Election Programme of the(previous reference:     Conservative Government in 1929 included proposalsCabinet 11(30), Con-     that home-fed beef should be supplied to the elusion 12.)Fighting Forces at home for six months in the yearand that flour supplied to Army -and Air Forcebakeries for the six months after harvest should contain a percentage of English wheat;    that theproposal had been rejected by the Labour Governmentin 1929 and 1930 on economic and financial grounds-,but that the matter was likely to be raised again.in, the near future.   He therefore enclosed a Memo-.randum by the War Office dealing With the proposals from the standpoint of cost and practicability.The Secretary..of State added a warning that he was unable to find money for this change from ArmyE&amp;timates.    Any additional charge in a matter whichwas of no military advantage to the Army was beyondhis capacity -to meet.The Cabinet invited the Secretaryof State for War to send theMemorandum to the Cabinet Committeeon Agricultural Policy-.
NEXT MEETING 11.    The Cabinet agreed  OP CABINET.To meet the same afternoon at-30 p.m. to complete the Agenda2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1December 16, 1931,
APPEND I X.HOST SECRET328(31)Draft Reply to French Memorandum on Reparations  (see cp.  3107,31))&apos; as . amended &apos; and approved by the.&quot; cabinet at their Meeting on December 16th,  1931.       11. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have studied with the greatest care the Memorandum stating thepoint of view of the French Government in regard to reparations.       H.M, Government are deeply impressed,as no doubt are the French Government also, with the vital necessity for reaching a satisfactory settlement of theproblem of reparation and war debts without delay andthey therefore welcome the full and authoritative statementof the views of the French Government and desire in replyto state their own views with equal frankness.2. The point of view of H.M, Government is as follows.In July last the London Conference recommended thatthe commercial creditors of Germany should agree to maintainthe volume of their existing credits to Germany and that aCommittee should be appointed to enquire into the further-credit needs of Germany. In making this recommendation theGovernments at the same time gave the assurance that &quot;in orderto ensure, the maintenance of the financial stability ofGermany, they (the Governments) were ready to co-operate,so far as lies within their power, to restore confidence.&quot;The Conference also expressed the view that if the measuresthey recommended were carried through, they would form&quot;a basis of more permanent action to follow&quot;.    The measures proposed by the London Conference were duly carried out;    thePWiggin Committee&quot; was e-ppointed by the Rank for International
Settlements and the &quot;bunking credits were, on the faith ofthe declarations made by the London Conference, maintained attheir existing volume till February 29th, 1932, by means   ofthe Standstill agreements,,3a In their Report, the Wiggin Committee emphasised the need for the Governments to act without delay,,    &quot;We feelcertain&quot;, they said &quot;that the Government?s representatives at the London Conference, in taking the responsibility: of recommending to the Bankers of the world that they shouldtake concertod measures to maintain the volume of the credits they had already extended to Germany, fully realised that their proposal was not a solution of the problem buta means of gaining time9 during which steps for re-establish-Xng the credit of Germany might be taken&apos;&apos;0&quot;But time is short0      The body of the wo rid&apos;scommerce - whose vitality-is already low - has suffered a severe shock in one of its ohief members,-   This has resultedin a partial paralysis which can only he cured by restoring the free circulation of money and of goods.    We believe thatthis can be accomplishedj hut only if the Governments ofthe world will realise the responsibility-that rests upon them and. will-t-ake ,prompt measures to re-establish confidence..Their action alone e-an restore it0-   We think it essentialthat he fore the period of prolongation of credits^recommended by the London Conference comes, to an. end,, theyshould give to the world the assurance that: internationalpolitical relations are established on a basis, of mutalconfidence, which is the sine qua non of economic recovery,,and that the International payments to &quot;be made by germany will not he such as to Imperil the maintenance of herfinane i a! -stapi.lltyMD

Committee to determine the procedure which itshould follow in its inquiry^    But His. Majesty&apos;s Governmentare in full accord with the French Government in desiring the.Committee to undertaKe a thorough examination of all the aspectsof the German financial situation without any limitation, andto recommend, with the authority that their internationalreputation as experts in monetary and economic affairs mustcommand., the measures required :to restore the stability of theGerman currency and budget and to permit the revival of normaleconomic and financial life both In Germany and in the rest ofthe world., and finally to state what steps are required, inthe light of Germany&apos;s capacity of /
payment, to enable this result to be achieved.,      It will thenbe for the Governments concerned, bearing in mind the under-takings entered into at the London Conference, to take such decisions in regard to reparations as may make it possiblefor the credit of Germany to be restored,6. Germany, of course, remains bound by the HagueAgreement unless aixl until that agreement is modified byconsent,      But as the French Government recognise,  theeconomic crisis which has since developed has made the f ulf il*-ment of the Young Plan, as it stands, impossible and thequestion is what adaptations are necessary to meet thepresent situation.    That question will have tp be consideredby the Governments in the light of the recommendationsformulated by the Special Advisory Committee, and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment do not consider that, it is right or- wise to formulate limitations beforehand..     It is. always open to acreditor to revise a settlement which has proved unworkableand a wise creditor will do so betimes rather than forcehis debtor into liquidation.,.     What, is a sound business prin-ciple In regard to private claims is equally a. necessity inregard to international claims as the economic and financial interests of all countries are inextricably connected andthe financial and economic collapse of any one. nation, must inevitably produce the gravest effects throughout the restof the world,7. Accordingly, until the Report of the AdvisoryCommittee has been received.,, it would be premature for t heGovernment to formulate their views., in detail. . But thereare certain broad principles which must,. In the opinion of. his majesty&apos;s Government? be regarded as fundamental,     A settle^meut is required which will restore the credit of Germany,4    iTT
and this can only be attained by an arrangement Tfhichwill ensure that the governmental obligations of germany will not endanger the economic life of the country and pre-elude its citizens from duly honouring obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business.8. The foregoing considerations are in accordancewith many of the principles enunciated in the FrenchGovernment&apos;s memorandum-.      But -some -of the specificstipulations put forward by the French Government donot seem to be in harmony with &quot;these principles.,     the satisfactory reparation settlement, whi chit is essentialto achieve without delay,  cannot be secured by eachCreditor   Power bringing to the discussion a settledseries of demands., before Germany&apos;s capacity to pay-has been determined/in--the-course&apos;   of an impartial enquiry into the facts, by the Advisory Committee,90 There is another aspect off this   question towhich His Majesty&apos;s Government desire&apos; to refer. TheFrench Government state that it is the firm determina-tion of France at the forthcoming Conference to insist on retaining her &quot;sQlde&quot; or surplus of -reparation receiptsover war debt payments.        Is such a proposal calculated to appeal to the Governments to which &apos;^ar Debts are due as a ground for reducing such Debts ?       Is it notapparent that by the proposed arrangement france would be merely passing on to Germany any concessionmade to her by others,, without sacrificing   any- ofher own surplus receipts ?
ills majesty&apos;^ ^ovemaeiit would &quot;add that, while the &quot;Young&quot;Plairallotted to certain Powers a surplus over their net war debtannuities, there is nothing in the Plan which gives such surplusesany priority or preference as regards the distribution of  the annuities.    In so far therefore as any reparations payments areavailable, the grant of a priority of any kind for the French^solde&quot; would represent an innovation in favour of France, itwould operate to the detriment of this Country and would not bepossible for any British Government to contemplate.10, There is one other point which His Majesty&apos;s government must emphasize.    During the past few years, the United kingdom has contributed in far larger measure than France to the main-tenance of German economic life.    It has done so partly by puttingat the disposal of Germany commercial and banking credits, amount-ing altogether to close on  80 millions.    These credits were notspeculative investments attracted by the prospects of a high return,,They represent in the main the normal and ordinary means by whichinternational trade is carried on, and in fact are commercialcredits of a self-liquidating character constituting the soundesttype of banking security.    But this country also helped German trade,by offering a free market to her goods such as none, of the  othercreditor Governments have given.    Largely as a result of thispolicy, Germany has during the past three years, had a net favour-able balance of trade amounting to about  100 millions,, if onlythe British exports to Germany are taken into account, and of over.350 millions, if re-exports from the United Kingdom as well as british exports, are included.
