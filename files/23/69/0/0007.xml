err or ism inoposeddinance.previous reference :Cabinet 27131), Con-elusion 14.)79 (a.) i.1.    The Secretary of State for India reportedthat the situation in Bengal was extremely serious.A terrorist campaign was being directed against all government officials.    It was no longer confined toofficers who were concerned in the capture, trial andsentence of terrorists, but was directed againstofficials as Europeans.    The danger applied, forexample, to persons like revenue officers in executionof their ordinary duties.   The Governor of Bengalhad advised that Sir Charles Tegart,    the Head ofthe Police in Bengal, roust not be allowed to return from his leave, as he would be murdered.    One youngofficer had recently been sent home because thealternative open to him was to remain in his houseunder continuous police guard,   ^he Viceroy had sent a special Officer to consult with the Bengal Govern-ment, and the advice of the Commander-in-Chief hadbeen called for,   A series of proposals for therestoration of order and the suppression of terrorismhad now been prepared, and the Government of Bengal,supported by the Government of India, proposed toput in force a Special Emergency measure by Ordinance.One part of the Ordinance consisted of measures withwhich the Secretary of State did not consider itnecessary to trouble the Cabinet.   The other part ofthe Ordinance, however, which was to apply to thewhole of Bengal, was designed in order to set upspecial tribunals to enable the course of justice tobe pursued without obstruction by terrorists or bymisuse of the ordinary provisions of the criminal procedure Code.   The portion on which he considered it necessary to consult the Cabinet was a provision which extends the death penalty to persons guilty of attempted murder.   This would not be applied byan ordinary magistrate, but only by tribunals consisting
of three persons, a President, who is to be a judge of the High Court, and two members, who must be qualified to be High Court Judges, and who would only convict in cases in which the Provincial Govern-ment had made representations that the attemptedmurder was part of the terrorist campaign.    TheSecretary of State admitted that this was a verydrastic provision.    It had never been imposed exceptin the case of attempts by fanatics on the Worth-West  -Frontier, and in that of attempts by life convicts.The Secretary of State supported the proposal of theGovernment of Bengal and the Government of india on the ground that unless our Public Servants wereprotected the whole Administration might collapse.There were indications that the European populationof Calcutta might at any moment take the law into their own hands and undertake reprisals .   The european community in Calcutta did not consider that theGovernment of Bengal had hitherto taken sufficiently strong measures to deal with the situation.After a number of questions had been directed tothe Secretary of State for India, the Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State for india should be authorised to inform theGovernment of India that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdomsupport them in theSpecial Emergency measure that they proposed to put in operation, but that before the powers were effectivelyexercised they would be glad to haveanswers to the -following questions(l) Whether all the Members of theGovernor-General&apos;s Councilapprove the proposal to take these powers?(2) Whether Indians would be qualified to sit on the tribunals?(S) Whether the proposal would upset the right of convicted persons to
petition the King for leave to appeal to the Privy Council?(4) Whether sentence could he passedby a majority of the Court?(5) Whether the definition of &quot;attemptedmurder&quot; was the same in India as inthe United Kingdom?(6) Whether the Secretary of State would retain the right to exercise effective powers for revision of sentences, whichthe Cabinet, considered advisable?(7) As to the duration of the SpecialEmergency Ordinance.    (NOTE:    TheSecretary of State for Indiay whohad left the Cabinet to answer questions in the Chamber of theHouse of Commons when this point was raised, has since informed the Secretary that the duration ofall such Emergency Ordinances issix months, subject, of course., tothe possibility of renewal..)
EXCESSIVEIMPORTATIONAND &quot; &quot;DUMP-The AbnormalImportations(Customs Duty)Bill.[previous reference:Cabinet 77(31), Con-conclusion 3.)7^&quot;2.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer raised as a matter o.f urgency the question of the time-table of the Abnormal Importations (Customs Duty) Bill.He pointed out that some speeding up of the normal procedure was necessary if the Bill was to be passedduring the present week;    otherwise its passage through Parliament might last a fortnight.The Cabinet were reminded that any serious delay in the passing of the Bill would not only militateagainst its effectiveness but would have a badParliamentary effect.The Prime Minister said that he had already given instructions to the Parliamentary Secretaryto the Treasury to arrange, for the passage of theBill in time for it to pass the House of Lords and receive the Royal Assent before the end of the week.The President of the Board of Trade said thathe agreed to the proposal of the Cabinet at theMeeting referred to in the margin to limit the Billto six months instead of twelve.At the request of the Chancellor of theExchequer the Cabinet agreed  That,  in view of the urgency of expediting, the passage of the abnormal importations (customs duty) Bill   the normal procedure of submitting it to the Committeeof Home Affairs should be dispensed with and that approval of the Billshould be left to the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the President ofthe Board of Trade, in consultationwith Parliamentary Counsel.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,November 16, 1931.
