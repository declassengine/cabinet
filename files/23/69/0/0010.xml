112CHINA.Japanese&quot;Action in manchuria,(previous reference:Cabinet 79(31), Con-elusion 2.)ft.l.The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C.P.-294(31)) describing the position reached in the deliberations of the Council of the League of nations on the difficulties between China and Japan concerningManchuria.   The precise position reached was that aresolution had been proposed for the establishmentby the League of a Commission of Enquiry,     a resolu-tion which had been communicated to the two partiesto the dispute for their observations.   It waspointed out in the Memorandum that in the event of acceptance of this resolution the Commission ofEnquiry could not report for eight or nine months,Meanwhile there was no assurance that the japanese would evacuate the territory which they had occupiedand which they had been asked to evacuate.   TheCouncil, therefore, would have failed in its immediateobject of putting an end to the Japanese occupationof Chinese territory, and would have to look onwhile its own summons was ignored.    It would have torealise that it had failed to enforce the fundamentalprinciple that a State may not, without priorrecourse to the recognised means of peaceful settle-ment? take the lav? into its own hands .The Secretary of State, in his Memorandum,suggested that even if the resolution were adopted the Council should reaffirm the above principle.Any declaration to this effect would come best fromthe President himself.    If, however, the president was not prepared to make a sufficiently strongdeclaration, the question was raised as to whetherthe British Delegate should take the lead in doing so, bearing in mind that this would offend theJapanese Government.   The position was put by theSecretary of State as follows:-?
&quot;Here we have got to weigh the disadvantages against each other.On the one hand the immediatedisadvantage to ourselves inlosing favour with Japan;    andon the other hand the generalrisk,  in which we share,  isthat the League, in refusing to reaffirm its true function, willlose so &quot;much respect as may yet&quot;be accorded to it in the face of its failure to enforce itsdemands upon the parties&quot;.If the resoltition was not adopted, the Secretary ofState thought that the Council could, do no more thanit did on October 24th, namely, to reaffirm itsresolution of September 30th (i.e,, taking note ofthe Japanese representative^ statement that hisGovernment would continue as rapidly as possible with the withdrawal of its troops, etc.) and placeagain on formal record Its views as to the obliga-tions of both parties .   This, however, would be aconfession of complete failure, not veiled in bythe despatch of a. Commission of Enquiry to the far East.The Secretary of State entered a warning thatthe Chinese Delegate might put into effect the threat which he had often uttered and appeal tothe Council under Article XV of the Covenant,  in which case the Council would have to make an investigation and could decide independently of the parties tosend out a Commission of Enquiry,The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsamplified his Memorandum by a verbal statement tohis colleagues.In the course of a short discussion the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs asked that the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs should not ovelook the need for constiltation with the Dominions if theproceedings of the Council of the League shouldtake such a turn as to render this desirable.
The Cabinet, while favouring astatement by the President(M. Briand) on behalf of theCouncil, indicating the prin-ciples of the League, and regret-ting that in the present Manchuriano-controversy those principles had notbeen more completely complied with,was. opposed to the British represent-ative1 taking up a special and separateattitude, and preferred that he should do his utmost, in association withother members of the Council, to pressprivately for a statement to this effect, on behalf of the wholeCouncil, from the President.
2.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that neither the Lord Chancellor nor the Secretary ofState for India was able to be present that morning,as they had to attend a meeting of the FederalStructure Committee on Financial Safeguards .   he regretted to have to inform the Cabinet that enquiryhad shown that the policy decided on at the meeting referred to in the margin was not acceptable to any section of the Round-Table Conference,   ^he Non- ;Congress Bindus had published a statement on the;subject in the Press of the same morning.   TheMohammedans and the Depressed Classes, as matters now stood, vieve also unfavourable.   If the policy were pursued it seemed probable that Congress woulddeclare a boycott.   The Minorities had made clearthat they could not make themselves responsible forthe carrying on of government without the support of   Ithe Non-Congress Hindus.   Conversations were proceed- Iing, and the whole matter was to be discussed bythe Cabinet Committee, after which the Prime Ministerhoped to be in a position to make a recommendation to the Cabinet.    It was for this reason that he hadsummoned a Cabinet Meeting for Friday, November 27th,at 10 afin.
usVHE STATUTEOP WESTMINSTER,(previous reference:Cabinet 80(31), Con-elusion 6.)3.   The Cabinet were informed that the Houseof Commons had passed the Statute of Westminster onthe previous evening and that it would be consideredby the House of Lords on the following day.
agricultural policy.m        Aproposal fora british wheat Quota.(previous reference:Cabinet 75(31), Con-elusion 12.)F.R.4. The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to a British Wheat Quota:-A. Memorandum by the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries  (C.P.-287(31))  on the subject of a british wheat Quota, asking for the authorityof the Cabinet to announce in theHouse of Commons that the Governmenthad approved of a wheat quota as ameasure of immediate assistance toarable farming and would putproposals before Parliament witha view to the scheme being inoperation in time for the harvestof 1932,   Reference was made to the relatively greater importance of barley to arable farmers inScotland, and the Minister askedto be authorised in any announcement to say that it is the intention ofthe Government to deal with barleyas well as wheat, if not concurrentlythen as soon as a practicable scheme can be devised, and if not by a quotathen in some other way:Some Notes by the Secretary of Statefor Scotland (CP.-292 (31)) on theabove Memorandum, firstly emphasising the small value of a wheat quota to scottish agriculture;    secondly,summarising the main heads of thearguments against the policy of aWheat Quota;    and, thirdly, outliningproposals for giving equivalentadvantages to Scottish agriculture in the event of a Wheat Quota being adopted for the benefit of Englishagriculture.While the policy of a British Wheat Quota was felt by some members of the Cabinet to be open to criticism from a political point of view, on a review of the difficulties of the international and national position, as well as of the Parlia-rnentary situation, they did not press their objections to the point of rejection...While realising that the policy of a wheat quota was of value only to a certain percentage of english farming, and was of comparatively smallassistance to farmers in Scotland and in many parts of England, the Cabinet felt the need forcaution, particularly in view of the experience of
past Governments, in committing themselves to proposed items of policy that had not yet been worked out in detail.The Cabinet took note that the scheme of a wheat quota did not involve the imposition of a customs duty on either wheat or flour, or any contribution from the Exchequer by way of subsidy.After considerable discussion the Cabinet agreed(a) ^hat the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries should have authority to announce that the Government had decided to apply the principle ofa quota to home-produced millable wheat, and intended to introduce legislation in time to enable thedecision to become effective for next year&apos;s crop:(b) That, in making the first announce-ment, the Minister should avoid giving details either as to theamount of the proposed maximum price of British wheat or of thepercentage of the British quota;(c) While authorised to state that theWheat Quota was only an instalment of the Government&apos;s generalAgricultural Policy, and that other aspects of that policy were under close investigation, theMinister of Agriculture and Fisherieswas asked to be careful to avoid committing the Government to anyitem of policy on which a decisionhad not yet been taken.    For example,if he deemed it essential to mentionbarley (owing to the great interestof Scotland in barley as comparedwith wheat) he should only refer toit as one of the items in the generalagricultural problem which is underconsideration.   He was also asked, to mention that the quota scheme was not intended to encourage the cultivation of wheat on land unsuitable for thatpurpos e:(d) That the Prime Minister should askCommander Boothby to postpone untilthe morrow his Question on Agricul-tural Policy and to address it tothe Minister of Agriculture andFisheries, who would base his reply on the above decisions:(See also the following Minute.)(e) That the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries should, as soon as possible,circulate to the Cabinet details ofthe Wheat Quota Scheme.-?-
5. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries(CP ,-293 (31)) asking the consent of the Cabinetto the introduction of a Bill directed to therestriction, through the operation of tariffs, ofthe importation into this country of non-essential foodstuffs which can be produced in adequatequantities at home.   The Bill would be limited inoperation to twelve months, and its object wouldbe to protect the production of seasonal cropsin this country from, imports from countries further south, which, owing to earlier maturity, can beplaced on our market some weeks before home-producedcrops are available, and which thus take &quot;the creamof   the market&quot;.In the course of a discussion on this proposal the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries informed the Cabinet that produce of the Channel islands would not be affected by the Bill.The attention of the Minister was drawn to a difficulty that would be encountered in imposingDuties on some of the commodities he proposed toinclude in the Bill ad valorem. In the case offlowers, however,  it was pointed out that theimposition of Duties according to weight was equally impracticable.The Minister was also asked to bear in mind the importance of limiting his Bill as closely aspossible to early produce and of avoiding putting up the price of agricultural produce during theordinary season.Attention was drawn to the following passageat the end of the Memorandum, to the effect that
the proposals &quot;will be welcomed by the agriculturalcommunity because they rill show that the Governmentare not afraid of applying tariffs to foodstuffs....but the Minister explained that the inclusion of thiswas due to&apos; the Memorandum having been drawn ups omewhat ha s t ily .The Cabinet were reminded of the effects thatthe introduction of the Bill would have on Franceand other foreign countries affected, from whichprotests must be expected.The Minister mentioned that neither bulbs norfruit pulp would be included in the Bill.Subject to the above observationsthe Cabinet approved the proposal of the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries as set forth in C.P.-295(51), and authorised him to make anannouncement on the subject as partof the statement on agricultural policy referred to in the previousMinute.
jlNSTRecord, ofDissent fromCabinet;Conclusions.(previous reference;Cabinet Jf2(22), Gon-clusion If) .6.    The Cabinet discussed briefly the questionof whether a Minister who was not in entire agreement with a decision taken by the cabinet should be allowed to record his dissent orreservation in the Minutes,The Cabinet accepted the view of the PrimeMinister that the recording of notes of dissentor reservation was contrary to the general principle of Cabinet unity, and agreed -That notes of dissent orreservation should not be recorded in the cabinet minutes.
THE OTTAWA 7f    -As ^G Prime Minister had to leave theCONFERENCE.Meeting of the Cabinet to keep an official(previous engagement,  the Cabinet agreed -Reference:Gabinet 79 That the Report of the Cabinet(31), Con- Committee on the Ottawa&apos;elusion 16) . Conference, (CP, 288 (31)),should be reserved for theirf.R. next meeting,(The Prime Minister left the meeting atthis point, and the Lord President ofthe Council took the Chair).
8.    The Gabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Health and the Minister of Labour(G.P. 289 (31)) on the subject of the means testfor transitional payments.     It was stated that pressure was being exerted in Parliament and elsewhereon the two Ministers to issue instructions to PublicAssistance Authorities that certain types of resources at the disposal of applicants for transitional pay-ments should be uniformly disregarded in determining the question whether they are in need of transitional payments.      In particular, the request was made withreference to the pensions of disabled ex-Service men.After a detailed examination of the question it waspointed out that both Ministers are of opinion thatthe Government should stand by the decision theydeliberately took in October and should resist the pressure now being put upon them.      If they were togive way even as regards disability pensions it would,they pointed out, be necessary to have legislation,and once the legislative door was open it would notbe possible to restrict the proposals to this one point.      The Government would quickly be faced withthe necessity of trying to improvise at short noticea new Public Assistance Code for the relief of allable-bodied unemployed persons.In the course of a short discussion, theMinisters were asked to consider the possibilityof putting pressure by means of questions inParliament,  through local Members of Parliament,etc., on Local Authorities who were acting in a manner contrary to the advice given in the
circulars issued on behalf of the Government.The Cabinet approved theproposals of the Minister ofHealth and the Minister ofLabour, as set forth inG.P. 289 (31)j and summarised above.
IERNATIONAL3^-EFT ION INTO THEPLOYMENT OP.DMEN AT NIGHT9.

The Lord President of the Council said he had been asked by the Prime Minister to mention that a National Service was to be heldat St. PaulTs Cathedral on Tuesday, December 15th,at noon, in preparation for the DisarmamentConference.      The Service was intended to givea lead to m^ny other services all over thecountry, and had designedly been fixed just before Christmas.     invitations were being sent out in collaboration with the League ofNations Union.      Canon Alexander, of St. Paul&apos; cathedral, was anxious to know whether the cabinet would be represented, and if so, how manyMinisters could undertake to be present.     TheLord President of the Council asked all ministers who proposed to attend the Service to inform mr. C,p0 Duff, the Prime Ministers Secretary,at 10, Downing Street.
CADET CORPS. 12.    The Secretary of State for War reminded theCabinet that his predecessor had withdrawnrecognition from Cadet Gjrps, with the result thatthese Corps had been deprived of all government assistance, financial and otherwise.      Subsequentlyan English National Cadet Association, under the presidency of His Highness the Prince of Wales,had been formed, to keep the movement alive.He himself had received representatives of this association who had approached him.      He had informed them that the War Office oould not give them any money, as none was available, but hehad promised to give them recognition, which would assist them in various ways which he indicated tothe Cabinet.     The Association was quite satisfied with this promise.     He proposed to authorise therepresentative of the War Office in the House ofCommons to announce that recognition would begiven to the English National Cadet Association.The Cabinet approved the above proposal.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.-W.1.25th November, 1931.
