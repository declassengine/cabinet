The Prime Minister reminded tho Cabinetthat, through a technical oversight when theGovernment was formed,- seven Under-Secretaries hadbeen appointed in the House of Commons, whereas theexisting law permitted only six, and a Bill ofIndemnity would be necessary.    He had been consider-ing whether the difficulty should be met by appoint-ing an extra Under-Secretary in the House of Lords,or, alternatively, by getting legal sanction to sevenParliamentary Under-Secretaries in the House ofCommons.   His investigations led to the view thatthe. latter course was preferable, and he intendedto see Lord Salisbury on the subject at once.-1-

LONDON TRAFFIC. 6. ^e Cabinet had before them the Report of theCabinet Committee on London Traffic (Paper CP.-305(Previous .. , .Reference: (29)), the Conclusions of which are summarised in cabinet 35(29), Con-        Paragraph 46 of the Report as follows:,-conclusion 2.)(l) There is an urgent need for a wide measure of co-ordination of the under-takings engaged in passenger transport in the London Traffic Area.   Under any-such scheme the railway, omnibus, andtramway undertakings of local authori-ties in the area, and other omnibusundertakings operating therein, mustbe brought under a co-ordinatedmanagement based upon a pooling of resources.    In existing circumstances there would be great difficulty in bringing the Amalgamated RailwayCompanies, in respect of their suburbanlines, into any scheme involving acommon fund and a common management,and still greater difficulty in trans-ferring their interest in those lines to a new and separate ownership.    these companies should, however, be enabled to enter into working and other arrange-ments with the co-ordinated undertaking in respect of their London suburbanlines, and it would also be necessaryto consider what additional machinerymight be desirable to prevent wastefulor unfair competition between therailwa,ys of the amalgamated companies and the new undertakings.(2) We see certain fundamental objectionsto the adoption of proposals on thelines of those set out in the BlueReport.(3) We are also unable, for the reasons give in this Report, to recommend ascheme of leases&quot; to a public body orthe acquisition by such a body of con-trolling interests, short of completeownership.(4) We are of opinion that the needs of thesituation can best be met, in confoitaitywith the policy of the Government,through the purchase of the &quot;Combine&quot;undertakings, the Metropolitan railway and the other omnibus undertakings, bya public body to be created by legis-olation.(5) If a ^scheme on the lines set out inthe - Appendix to this Report is approved in principle, we recommend that one ortwo. eminent Accountants (selected bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Transport) should be askedto advise the Government in the followingcircumstances.    On the assumptions
K 9(a) that the Company-owned under-takings are to he purchased by apublic or quasi-public body, andlb) that no Exchequer guarantee should be&apos; envisaged except so faras necessary to safeguard theposition of existing &quot;capitalalready oovered by such a guar-antee, but that, subject to any steps rendered necessary by theexistence of such guarantee, thenew authority should be financiallyself-supporting:-(i) On what basis should the pricebe negotiated, 1.e. , on a basisof net revenue or on market prices so far as asoertainable,or on a combination of both or.otherwise?(ii) Would the most favourable methodof financing such a transactionbe by issue of substituted stockor by terminable annuities, orotherwise, regard being had tothe probable financial resourcesof the purchasing body?(iii) Generally in the matter.(6) The tramways of the local authoritiesshould be transferred to the publicbody mentioned in paragraph (4) onthe basis that it would assume res-ponsibility for all outstanding debtcharges and other liabilities of theund e rt akin gs.(7) The body to be charged with theacquisition and subsequent management of the co-ordinated undertakingsshould be a small business board,consisting of not more than sevenmembers to be appointed by theMinister of Transport.After hearing a statement from the Minister ofTransport the Cabinet congratulated him on theresult of his Inquiry and agreed -(a) To approve the Conclusions of theCabinet Committee as set forth above:(b) That the Minister of Transport, inconsultation with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, should proceed at once with the proposals in Conclusion (5)in regard to the selection of eminentaccountants:(o) That the Minister of Transport shouldhave authority to negotiate with the
propor authorities and to communicateconfidentially to them the Government&apos;policy, availing himself of the good offices of the Prime Minister and theLord Privy Seal in this matter.-8-
7. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Postiaaster-Gonerfcl (Paper 0. P*-3il (29))    onthe subjeot of Wireless Telephony, suggesting theappointment of a small Committee of Ministers toexamine the question of whether the wirelesstelephony services, which, in accordance with therecommendations of the Imperial Wireless Conferenceof 1928, were retained in the hands of the Govern-ment, should be operated through the medium of thePost Office Wireless Station at Rugby or through theBeam telegraph stations which were leased to the communications Company.The Cabinet agreed  That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows  The Secretary of State for Air(in the Chair),The Postmaster-General,The Financial Secretary to theTreasury,The Secretary to the Departmentof Overseas Trade -should be appointed to examine thewhole problem and report to theCabinet on the question of policy.
BAST AFRICA,policy in.(previous reference:Cabinet 31(29), Con-conclusion 7.)8.  The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of Closer Union in EastAfrica:-A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies (Paper CP.-308 (29)),the recommendations of which are summarised in the last paragraph asfollows(i) That the Government should makea comprehensive declaration of native Policy to be published as a White Paper in continua-tion of those of 1923 and 1927.(ii) That new Instruments be preparedproviding for a High Commissionerfor East Africa, with a Legisla-tive Council for certain economicservices, and for a new LegislativeCouncil for Kenya, on the lines indicated in this Memorandum.(iii) That the heads of these Instru-ments, with full explanations indetail, together with the declara-tion on Native Policy, be laidbefore Parliament, with a resolu-tion appointing a Joint Committeeof both Houses&quot;to consider andreport upon the proposed con-stitutional changes.A Memorandum by the Secretaryv of Statefor India (Paper CP.-319 (29))criticising and objecting, from an indian point of view, to some ofthe proposals in Paper CP.-308 (29).After a short discussion the. question was postponed until the next Meeting of theCabinet.
