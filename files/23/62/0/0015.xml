that this prevents the export of1 munitions of war1 even though thisexport has the full approval of theGovernment Departments concerned.To prevent a manufacturer of aircraft, for instance, in thiscountry from communioating a sketchof aircraft, which he hoped tosell, mast seriously impede him inhis business&apos;.iThis position is being met todayby the refusal of my fiat which isnecessary to any prosecution.I cannot, however, allow this position to go on indefinitely, as my right to grant or withhold afiat must not he treated as though were a licensing authority.I desire to be relieved of a very real difficulty&quot;.The Cabinet agreed   4(a) That the Committee of Home affairs should further examine the draftOffioial Secrets Act (Amendment)Bill, and, in doing- so, should give special attention to the point asto whether any means could be found,without legislation or parliamentary debate, for carrying out what wasthe original intention of the official secrets Act, namely, to safeguardoffioial secrets of this country,while avoiding the unfortunatereactions to which the Attorney-General had called attention:(b) That, in view of the political con-siderations involved in the aboveexamination, the discussion shouldbe held without the presence of officials.

as soon as possible on the following proposals that a Joint Committee of both houses should be set up, as previously con-templated, but that, instead of sub-mitting to it the heads of the instruments providing for a HighCommissioner for East Africa, with a legislative Council, etc, as suggestedin CP.-308 (29) Conclusion (2), HisMajesty&apos;s Government should presentthe latest Reports on this subject(viz., by Commander Hilton-Youngand Sir Samuel Wilson), accompaniedby a reasoned commentary of an informa-tive character explaining the diffi-culties of the various proposals, aswell as by a Declaration on native policy.    The Joint Committee wouldthen be invited to base its&quot; recommenda-tions on the statement of Native Policyand on consideration of the otherReports in the light of the commentary,and the Government would reserve thedecisions,which they intended to submit for the approval of Parliament, until after the Report of the Select Committeehad been received.    It would be under-stood that when the matter came beforethe Joint Committee the Seoretary ofState for India and the Government ofIndia would have liberty to present their oase, but it was deemed undesirable that any other Governments should beallowed to complicate the question bypresenting their views-
