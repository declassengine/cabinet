I i at?PEKDIX I.GERMAN PROPBRTY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.STATEMENT TO BE MADE IN THE HOUSE OP COMMONS BYTHE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER.I will take these two questions together and as there has &quot;been a good deal of misunderstanding of the faotsreferred to, I propose, with the leave of the House, tomake a general statement of the position of His Maj&apos;estyrsGovernment in the matter.I have consulted the British Experts on theYoung Committee and I am informed that the disposal ofthe surplus proceeds of liquidation of German propertieswas fully considered by the Experts&apos; Committee in paris and that it was the intention of the British Experts, asit was the intention of the Experts of all the otherCreditor Governments, that the proceeds of liquidation ofthese properties should be retained, in accordance with theTreaty, by the Creditor Powers concerned and that no part of such proceeds should be repaid to S3rmany; and itwas only on this understanding that they agreed to recommend the reduction of the German obligations as proposed in thePlan.The text of the Report, indeed, makes theposition quite clear.     Section 8 provides that the annuitiesproposed in the Report should cover the obligations ofGermany, as defined in the Dawes Plan:   while Section 9
provides that the accounts of the Reparation Commissionrelating to the original capital debt should be closed.The Report proceeds&quot;The Creditor Governments under this plan will be reducing the whole body of their claims arising out of the war or under the Treaty ofVersailles to a considerable extent.   The experts of the Creditor countries are aware that past trans-actions have given or may give rise to claims byGermany, some of which are still unsettled, and while they are not able to go into the merits ofthese claims, they consider that the Creditor Govern-ments are fully entitled to expect that germany should waive them in consideration of the consolida-tion of the Creditors1 claims   at a reduced figure.Any other course would be inconsistent with their intention that, just as the new Annuities- coverall the claims defined in Part XI of the DawesPlan, so they should be paid free of deduction inrespect of any past transactions.    The Committeerecognises however that this is entirely a matter for the Governments to deal with&quot;.I may explain that the German propertiessequestrated during the war were transferred to the creditor Governments as at the date of the entry into forceof the Treaty viz. 10th January, 1920.    The German Govern-ment at the same time retained the proceeds of liquidation of property of Allied nationals in Germany and undertook to compensate ite own nationals in respect of theirproperties liquidated abroad.   The Treaty provided that the proceeds of liquidation realised by the Creditor Govern-ments might be applied to meet private claims of their nationals on account of debts, property losses and compensation awards due fcy Germany and that, thereafter, any surplus might be retained by the Creditor governments on account of their reparation claims.   After theGerman schedule of payments was fixed in 1921, theReparation Commission decided, and duly informed the GermanGovernment, that any surplus proceeds so retained would be
[I credited to Germany on account of the capital reparation debt andInet on account of the current annuities.     The liquidation of theseproperties was taken into account by the Second Experts&apos; Committeeappointed in 1924 and the German annuities fixed both in the Dawesplan and in the Young Plan were based on the capacity of Germany to3 pay, on the assumption that these properties were definitely lostI to Germany,On two occasions the German Government raised claimsbefore the Interpretation Tribunal set up under the Dawes Plan forcredits in respect of the proceeds of liquidation of German propertyagainst the German annuities as defined by Section II of Part I ofthe Dawes Plan, but on each occasion the Tribunal has rejected these claims, and under the terms of Section 8 of the Young plan, these decisions will apply also to the annuities payable under the Young.Plan.    It appears to bo quite clear that while the Young Committeerecommendec that the Crecitor Governments should discontinue their right to liquidate in the future, they did not contemplate thatGermany should be repaid any part of the proceeds of past liquidations.The only action therefore required at the Hague conference was the drafting of the exact formula required for putting theabove recommendations into effect, which has been entrusted to theCommittee set up by that Conference &quot;to apply the recommendationsof the Chapter IX of the Report of the Experts relating to the liquidation of the past&quot;.     The report of that Committee has notyet been completed but I am informed that the representatives ofall the creditor Governments are agreed that the German Govern-nent must waive all claims on these balances, as a condition ofthe ooming into force of the Young Plan.      In this connection, Ishould point out that it is quite untrue to say that the BritishGovernment are pursuing a policy different from that of theother creditor Governments in Europe in this matter.       neither
France nor Italy nor Belgium, so far as I am aware, have any intention of returning tc the German Government any part ofthe proceeds of past liquidations.    All they have done orundertaken to do is to suspend liquidations and to releaseproperties not yet liquid, liquidated or finally disposed of.His l&amp;jesty^ Government have offered to enter into asimilar arrangement, as regards the cessation Of futureliquidations, and they suspended liquidations as from the31st August last.As regards the past, the proceeds of liquidation ofGerman properties in this country have in accordance with thearrangements in the treaty referred to above been used in thefirst instance for meeting the private claims of british nationals.    This accounts for the great bulk of the money.The surplus, which is estimated at about  14 millions, is paid, to the Exchequer as it is realised.    This surplus,being a general balance, cannot of course be earmarked oridentified as the proceeds of any particular property andthere is no better case for returning it to the GermanGovernment than for returning the merchant ships or otherTreaty deliveries on reparation account made&quot; by Germany in1920.His Majesty&apos;s Government consi&amp;er that the retentionof this surplus forms an integral part of the Experts&apos; Plan,and they will in no circumstances agree to any such modification of the Plan, at the expense of this country, as would be involved by the return of any part of this sum to theGerman Government.In saying this, I must not be understood as over-looking1 the hardships sustained by the German nationalsconcerned who have not yet received the compensation providedfor in the Treaty but this is a matter within the competence of the German Legislature.IV *
His Majesty&quot; s Government have indeed, contributedvery substantially to alleviate the hardships of individuals, with whom I have always had. much sympathy,by the discretionary releases, on humanitarian grounds,granted by the Board of Trade especially on the.recommendation of the Blanesburgh Committee.    Tho; totalof propex^ties already released under this; procedureexceeds  5 millions.    In addition, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have offered, in accordance, with therecommendation of the Yc.un  Coumi.tt.ee,, to waive claims toproperties not yet liquidated (including dollar securitieswhich are the subject of litigation) estimated to be wortha further  5 millions.    Thus His       esty1s Government will,when the Youn^ Plan is definitely adopted, have releasedaltogether German properties or claims valued at over 10 millions - a much larger amount than any sums whichI believe have been released or are likely to be released by any other of the European creditor Governments.It seems to me that the renunciation of these claimsrepresents the fullest measure of generosity which can bejustiflod and in my opinion it gives of feet, as fully as can be done, to the desire which I have expressed when in aposition of less responsibility to see these provisionsof the Treaty ultimately abandoned.
APPENDIX II.B3ETRACT FROM PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,&quot; HOUSE OF COMMONS.&apos;Monday. November 18th. 1929.UNEMPLOYMENT .Political Parties (Co-operation).48.   MR. PHILIP OLIVER asked the Prime Minister whether hewould be prepared, in consultation with the leaders of thetwo Opposition parties, to appoint a Committee comprisedof Members of all parties to advise as to what furtherschemes are practicable for dealing with the problem ofunemployment?81.     MR. MANDER asked the Lord Privy Seal whether he isprepared to consider the appointment of a Committee drawn from Members of all parties in the House to assist him inthe solution of the unemployment problem?THE PRIME MINISTER:    In the speech that he made immediately after we took office, my right hon. friend the Lord Privy Seal, while safeguarding Governmentresponsibility for policy, announced his intention of seeing how far he could mobilise the good will which webelieved existed in all parties and in the country generally to devise a programme for dealing with the problem ofunemployment.     As regards an all party Committee , I shouldremind the House, that when we were in opposition we made such a proposal to our predecessors, who regarded it asimpracticable, but if I could see anything which would
justify the belief that the parties opposite wereprepared to co-operate and that useful results wouldbe obtained, always safeguarding the responsibilityof the Government, I should be willing to considerrepresentations.
