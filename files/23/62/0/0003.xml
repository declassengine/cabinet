1. The Cabinet had before them the following documents in regard to the present position ofthe British Coal Industry:-The Interim. Report (Paper CP..-268 (29)) of the Cabinet Committeeon the British Coal Industry,covering a Memorandum by the MinesDepartment on District and Inter-District Schemes for the regula-tion of Coal Output and Prices,which had been before the cabinet at the previous Meeting:A Memorandum (Paper CP.-274(29)) on Mining-Royalties,prepared in the Treasury and circulated by direction of theChancellor of the Exchequer andthe President of the Board ofTrade.The Lord Privy Seal made a statement regardingthe present position of the coal negotiations and added that the members of the CabinetCommittee were to see representatives of the mine-owners and, later on, of the miners thesame afternoon.    It was therefore necessary thatthey should receive instructions from the Cabineton certain points which he outlined.The Cabinet reviewed the position in thelight of the various pledges which had beengiven on the subject of hours and wages, moreparticularly a letter from the Labour PartyExecutive to Mr A. J. Cook, published in &quot;TheMiner&quot; of May 18, 1929, and the appropriatepassage in the Labour Party Programme for theGeneral Election, 1929.    Copies of both these documents are attached as Appendices I and II.After considerable discussion^ the cabinet agreed on the following policy:-
(a) That the legislation to be Intro-duced In the present Session ofParliament should make provisionfor a 7-g hours working day for miners as from April 1, 1930,which will give time for somemonths experience to be gainedas to the effect on the industry of the selling agencies already established and about to beestablished:(b) That the Ministers engaged in thenegotiations with the&quot; representa-tives of the nine-owners and ofthe miners- should have authorityto announce the above date at suchstage as they might deem advisable:(c) That as records the eventual reduc-tion of miners&apos; hours to a 7 hoursday, the Ministers concerned in thenegotiations with the representa-tives of the miners should have authority to announce that immedi-ately after the passing of the^-hours day Bill the government intended to take up the widerprogramme of re-organisation ofthe mining industry, including the pressing forward of schemes of amalgamation,  stimulation of rationalisation (-emphasising by. comparison the permissive characterof previous legislation), and so forth, with a view to strengthening-the industry and so preparing1 theway for a reduction of hours to a7-hours day as soon as possible without the risk of reducing wages:(d) That the Bill making provision forthe 7-^-hours day should not itselfinclude a reference to the ultimate7-hours day, but that in introducing the Bill the Minister in charge should make clear the policy ofthe Government as set forth in Cc)above:(e) That the Government should avoidbecoming involved in any wagesdispute, but that, subject to this consideration, they should do their utmost to bring about the meetings between the mine-owners and minerswhich are desired by the representa-tives of the latter and to stimulate the simplification by the industry itself of the present complicatedsystem governing&quot; the wages of theminers:Cf) To adopt the policy of acquisi^tion by the State of mining-royalties on the general lines
advocated by the Mines Department,under which the mineral rights would be taken over by the Stategradually and only as practicaladvantage demands:(g) That the President of the Board ofTrade should instruct the MinesDepartment to prepare, for early consideration by the Cabinet, thedraft of a Bill for the acquisitionof mining royalties by the Statoon the above lines, subject to thefollowing: -(i) As regards unproved mineralsno compensation could beprovided:(ii) As regards ascertained butundeveloped minerals, theperiod for ascertaining thecommercial value to be&quot;twoyears (which could be extended,if necessary, under Parliamentarypressure).
ACQUISITION)F LAND FORPUBLICPURPOSES.(previous reference:Cabinet 36(29), Con-clusion 2 and appendix (;?).2,      On the initiative of the Acting PrimeMinister the Cabinet agreed  (a) That a Cabinet Committee,  composed as follows  The Lord President of the Council(In the Chair),and representatives of thefollowing Departments:Treasury,Ministry of Health,Ministry of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries,Ministry of Transport,with authority to set up a departmental Committee to workout details  should examine the question of theAcquisition of Land for public purposes, whether by GovernmentDepartments or by Local Authorities,including the question of givingpower to Local Authorities toacquire land for prospectivedevelopment:(b) That the Secretary of State forScotland should be empowered toset up a corresponding Committee,mutatis mutandis, for Scotland.
THE HOURS OP 3. Tne Cabinet had before them the FirstEMPIjOYMENT Report (Paper CP.-273 (29)) of a Cabinet Com-mittee on the House of Employment Bill, in which(previous reference: decisions of policy by the Cabinet were asked for cabinet 30(29), Con- on the following questions:-s conclusion 9.)RAILWAYS:    on which the CabinetII   Su- C&quot;6mmlt&quot;te&quot;e proposed either (i) thatWt        . the Bill should apply to railways^9(^)3 but that it should expressly leaveH railwaymen to be dealt with solelyunder the provisions of the railways act, 1921; or (ii) that the railway-men should not be specificallyexempted, but that power should begiven to the Minister of Labour to approve, as being within the pro-are not less favourable t&quot;;:-an  theprovisions of the Act.COAL MINING-: to be covered by aseparat e Bill in course of prepara-tion.FIVE-DAY VvEEK, etc    The committee proposed the e nactment of a dailylimit of 8 hours with a generalsanction for 9 hours in certaincircumstances, and, further, the granting to the Minister of Labourpower to sanction (subject always to the normal weekly maximum of 48)arrangements permitting a longernormal working day where two completedays rest or more are given duringthe week*AVERAGING OVER A PERIOD:    TheTTomniiT^tee proposea a wTder powerthan that contemplated by theWashington Convention should begiven to the Minister of Labour.Instead of averaging being onlypermissible in certain limitedclasses of employment, and only thenif covered by an agreement, they proposed that the Minister shouldbe given power applicable to any trade not only to sanction agree-ments but to make regulations inthe last resort in default of agree-ment and also in cases where employers or workers are not organised.OVERTIME:    The Committee proposedtnat&quot;, apart from the special pro-visions lor preparatory or comple-mentary work or for emergencies,there should be a wide permission to work overtime in cases of pressure of work, subject to the payment ofthe overtime rate of wages of atleast 25 pei cent.
The Committee pointed out that a Bill on theabove lines, though suited to the conditions ofBritish industry, maintaining its standards of conditions of work and permitting some practicesmore favourable to the workpeople than a strictinterpretation of the terms of the WashingtonConvention, would not allow of immediate ratifi-cation of the Convention.    They asked for per-mission to proceed, on the above lines.The Minister of Labour reported that in regardto railways the question had now been examined further and it was proposed to adopt the second of the alternatives mentioned above.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Cabinet Conmittee should proceed on the lines set forth intheir First Report (Paper CP.-273(29)), subject to the Minister ofLabour&apos;s observation recorded above:(b) That the Minister of Labour should place herself in communication withthe Home Secretary with a view tothe co-ordination of the arrange-ments for overtime in the Hoursof Employment Bill and the Factories-Bill.
4. Owing to the temporary indispositionof the Home Secretary the Cabinet did not discuss the Factories Bill.
5. -The Cabinet had bef ore-theni a Memorandum(Paper C.P.-269 (29)) by the Minister of health on the subject of Birth Control, in which he proposed to follow the policy adopted by hispredecessors., namely:-(i) The Maternity and Child WelfareCentre should deal only with the expectant and nursing motherand infant) and not with the married or unmarried womancontemplating the applicationof contraceptive methods.(ii) It is not the function of anAnte-Natal Centre or maternity and Child Welfare Centre to give advice in regard to birth control,and exceptional cases in whichthe avoidance of pregnancy seems desirable on medical groundsshould be referred by the medical officer of the Centre for particu-lar advice to a private practitioneror hospital.The Minister of Health further proposed inhis Memorandum that if any proposal were made inParliament that the Medical Officers of the centres should be allowed to give advice and information as to contraceptive methods to marriedwomen who attended the Centres, in those cases in which the Medical Officers consider that ^heavoidance of further pregnancies is desirableon medical grounds, the question should be left toa free vote of the House.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Minister of Health, and agreed that, if the Minister were pressed on the subject in the Houseof Commons, he should have authorityto announce that in cases where therewere medical grounds for giving advice to married women on contraceptivemethods, it should be given, butthat such advice would be limitedto cases where pregnancy would be detrimental to health.

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum(Paper Co P. - 271 (29)) by the Minister ofTransport on the subject of the proposal ofthe Central Electricity Board to er:vct overheadtransmission lines between Brighton andEastbourne, passing over the South Downs.    Inthis Memorandum the Minister reported that after careful consideration of the Report of the inquiry which was held on his behalf inSeptember, and after personally inspecting thepart of the route to &quot;hich objection had been mainly taken, he had decided to give his consent,subject to further consideration being given tothe position of the line and its supports tothe immediate south-west and south-east of OffhamVillage, and subject also to the reservation ofa power to review the situation at any time afterthe expiration of a period of five years.The Cabinet took&apos; note of and approved the decision of theMinister of Transport.
ti 0TEE GENERALSTOPPAGE OP1926.^Previous-Reference:tiCabinet 351(29), Con-clusion 8. )7. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum :(Paper C.P.-264 (29)) by the First Commissioner ofWorks on the Position of Employees of his majesty&apos;s Office of works who took part in theGeneral Stoppage of 1926.    The Minister statedthat he had received representations from theTrade Union Side of the Departmental JointIndust rial Council and from the General Secretaryof the Transport and General Workers1 Union, onthe subject of certain disabilities under which some of the direct employees of His Majesty&apos;office  of Works labour in consequence of instruc-tions which were issued at the conclusion of the stoppage, to the effect that men who had remained at work or who had returned to work before theend of the stoppage should be given seniority overall those who had participated in the dispute.Since 1926 there had been few discharges owing toreduction of work, and such discharges as had beenmade had been for reasons of age or disability,and the Department had not been called upon to implement the instructions of the Government ofthat day.    The time would undoubtedly arrive,however, when reductions would have to be made onthe basis of juniority, and the Minister proposedto restore the men who took part in the stoppageto their positions on the seniority lists wrhichthey occupied prior to May, 1926.The Cabinet agreed  That there would be no objectionto the FilPst Commissioner of Worksadopting the practice of theAdmiralty in regard to employeesat Deptford who&apos;took part in theGeneral Strike, viz.- &quot;That it isnot part of the policy of thisDepartment to take the Strike intoconsideration in selecting men foradvancement or discharge&quot;.

APPENDIX_I.PLEDGES TO THE COAL INDUSTRY.Lebour Pert7,House of Commons.Dear Mr. Cook,You will remember when the officials of yourFederation met a Committee of the Executive of theParliamentary Labour Party on ?.Tarch 26th, it was decidedthat a letter should be sent to you confirming the resultof the conference.  .....It was made plain that one ofthe first things to be done in the first session of theLabour Government will be the Introduction of a Bill todeal with the -working hours of the miner......A suggestion was made that it should provide for 7-jg- hours bank to bank.To this the Committee saw no objection ..... But it wasagreed that the appropriate paragraph in the Party1selection manifesto should be confined to registering thenecessity for undoing the Tory Government^ (8 Hours) Act......Before the Bill is introduced Its precise terms will be amatter for consultation with the Miners&apos; Federation...You will find that it (the manifesto)  .... refers, tothe scientific utilisation of coal and its valuable by-products in connection with the nationalisation and re-organisation of the industry.......Yours sincerely,H.s. LINDSAY,Secretary.In response to a request from the Federation for a clearer definition of one point, Mr. Lindsay replied for theParliamentary Executive -
&quot;Undoubtedly it was agreed that in the first session of the Labour Government a Bill would beIntroduced to reduce the working hours of the miner.All that is outstanding is the decision as to the formthat Bill should take - whether, for instance, itshould be a simple repeal of the Tory Government^Act, or whether it should provide for seven hoursbank to bank.&quot;
APPENDIX_II.Extract  rom the.Labour Party Programme, GeneralElection. 1929. &quot;The state of the Coal Mining Industry is so tragicthat measures would be immediately undertaken to alleviate the distress In the coal fields, reorganise the industry from top to bottom both on its productive and marketingsides, and shorter hours of labour.     A labour majority would Nationalise the Mines and Minerals as the onlycondition for satisfactory working.     It would develop the scientific utilisation of coal and the valuable by-products, now largely wasted.
