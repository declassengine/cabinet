GRANTS TO&amp;B0ESSITOUSAREAS.(previous reference :Cabinet 53(29), Con-elusion 10.)The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of Grants to NecessitousAreas:-A Memorandum by the Minister ofHealth (Paper CP.-303 (29)), towhich was attached a Memorandumforwarded to him by the StandingJoint Committee of IndustrialWomen&apos;s Organisations.    In   his memorandum the Minister of Healthstated that he was by no meanssatisfied that the efforts whichare being made in the mining areas by the Coalfields Distress Fund,combined with the operations ofthe Boards of Guardians and LocalAuthorities in relief of distress,were adequate to the needs of thesituation.   The action he proposedto take forthwith was to issue a circular to Boards of Guardiansimpressing on them the need forhumane administration during thepresent difficult period.   He was of opinion that further aid fromExchequer funds should be provided this winter, and that it should beextended to areas outside the mining areas, but without prejudice to amaximum expenditure o&quot;England and Wa1es. 500,000forA Memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (Paper C.P.-367 (29))in which he pointed out that theMinister o^ Health had produced ascheme, which could not be confined to mining areas in which the Coal-fields Distress Fund operated but must be applied in all necessitousareas.    The Minister of Healthseemed to think it would still bepossible to keep to a maximum of 500,000.   The Chancellor of theExchequer held the view that theMinister of Health would next dis-cover that this sum was quite inadequate and. that the limit mustbe raised to several millions.Having given these grants for twowinters wre should have to repeatthem next year on an even higherscale.   He trusted, therefore, thatthe Cabinet would support him in hisemphatic opinion that the scheme should be rejected.
The Minister of Health and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer recapitulated to the Cabinet thearguments set forth in the foregoing Papers, and ageneral discussion followed.The Cabinet were reminded of the conclusion reached at a recent Meeting, when the operations of the Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund were under review (Cabinet51 (29), Conclusion 6\ of the large fresh expendi-ture by the Treasury for the relief of Unemployment,the Increase of Widows&apos; Pensions, and allowances for school children.    It was stated that there was growing evidence that actual and anticipated legis-lation of this character was having a depressing effect on business enterprise.   Emphasis was alsolaid upon the fact that the position should be materially improved from April next by the reorganised-isation of Public Assistance, and that temporaryrelief for the next two or three months would noteffectively deal with the fundamental problems ofthe Necessitous Areas,, which required to be handledin a more constructive fashion.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Minister of Health should notissue the proposed circular to the boards of Guardians or promise further financial aid:(b) That the Minister of Health shouldcontinue to study .       closely theposition in the Necessitous areas and should su^on into consultationthe ablest administrators, official and voluntary, in the local government service, with a view to framingconstructive proposals for theimprovement       those areas.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,December 20,  1^29 .
