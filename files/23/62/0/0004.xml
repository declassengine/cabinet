1. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum(Paper CP.-279 (29)) by the President of theBoard of Trade, raising the inter-related questionsof food policy, - the protection of the consumerin regard to the necessities of life, and theaction to be taken to deal with trusts and combines.The proposals contained in this Memorandum are summarised in paragraph 10 as follows:-(i) I suggest for consideration that Ishould be empowered to announce inthe House of Commons at an earlydate that in place of the presentPood Council It is proposed, assoon as the legislative programmepermits, to submit proposals forthe establishment of a Consumers&apos;Council for the purpose of safe-guarding the interests of theconsumer by obtaining the mostcomprehensive information in regardto the supply and prices not only of the foodstuffs at presentreviewed by the Food Council butalso of coal and clothing.    Ishould propose to add that the enquiries of the Council would extend to all stages of the pricestructure Including production andthe Oouncil would be given powerto obtain compulsorily all neces-sary information.    If, as may wellbe the case, we should be criticised for taking no action directly a-ffeot-ing the prices of the necessaries of life, I think the reply should bethat our remedy is public controland ownership, which we have nomandate to establish in the present parliament.(ii) As regards trusts and combines, we might announce our intention of introducing into Parliament in due course a Bill enabling the Boardof Trade to obtain the&apos; fullestInformation as to the operations of trusts and combines, and thatmeantime we are setting up aCommittee to re-view., the law retarding&quot;restraint of trade&quot;&apos;,&apos;--on the lineswhioh I have indicated above inparagraph 8.The discussion revealed that the Cabinet werein general agreement with the President of theBoa;rd of Traded proposals, so far as they went,tor obtaining the most comprehensive information
in regard to the supply and prioes not only ofthe foodstuffs at present reviewed by the PoodCouncil &quot;but also of coal and clothing.    On points of detail the Cabinet were reminded that so far asregards the stage of production in estimatingprice structure the Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries and the Scottish Office could alreadysupply most of the information that would berequired so far as foodstuffs were concerned.The general view of the Cabinet was that,while powers might well be obtained for dealingwith coal and clothing, it would be wise inpractice to concentrate, in the first instance,on food.The main criticism of the Cabinet, however,was that the President of the Board of Tradedproposals did not go far enough, and that it wouldbe desirable for him to take powers in some form to enable the Government in the last resort todeal &apos; ith any of the interests concerned whichmight disregard the recommendations of the consumers&apos; CouncilWhile approving the proposals of the Presidentof the Board of Trade in Paper CP.-278 (29),subject to the detailed observations referred toabove, the Cabinet agreed  (a) To invite the President of theBoard of Trade to submit proposalsfor obtaining compulsory powers fordealing with&quot;interests which mightpersist in charging excessive prices in defiance of the recommendationsof the Consumers&apos; Council.(b) To approve the appointment of aCommittee to review the law regarding^restraint of trade&quot;, as well as the&quot;announcement to be made in parliament in regard to Trusts and Combines, as summarised in paragraph (ii) above.   ,

But that theGovernment representatives antici-pate that a proviso win be includedto make it clear that the power of  :tdisallowance still remains&apos;intactin respect of Dominion legislation which might affect adversely theposition of holders of Dominion .stocks which have been admitted tothe Trustee List in this country.
(b) That, in agreeing to the su.rrend.erof the legislative power in regardto the Colonial Laws Validity Act,the Government representatives should do their utmost to secure acoept-ance of the following legislative restric-tions by the&quot;Dominions(i) Legislation with regard tothe Crown.(ii) Certain aspects of Defencelegislation so as to securethat the armed forces of each member of the British Common-wealth, wherever they may be,shall be subject, so far asinternal discipline is concerned,exclusively to the municipallaw of that member.(iii) The law of Prize.(c) As regards Merchant Shipping, totake note that&apos; the government representatives propose to layspecial stress on the following proposals(l) That the definition of &quot;british ship&quot;, whatever form that defini-tion may take, should in principlebe included as one of those matters whioh can only be altered. by the consent of all parts ofthe Commonwealth.(2) That each part of the Common-wealth should agree that it willnot legislate extra-territoriallywith regard to ships registered in another part without theconsent of that part.(3) That the law of the country of registration should prevail asregards the internal discipline and economy of the ship.(4) That within each jurisdictionall British ships should betreated alike and should begiven national and most-favoured-nation treatment.(d) That if the question of the proposedImperial Court were raised, theGovernment representatives should,discuss the question in a friendly and preliminary way and not commit themselves on the question further -than to recommend that it should be-examined at the next meeting of theImperial Conference.
(e) That the Government representatives should endeavour to secure theinclusion in the Report of someparagraph to the following effect:-Having regard to the equality of status already agreed uponat the Imperial Conference,1926, it seems to us, as atpresent advised, that therecommendations we have signed are not unreasonable,but it will be for the ImperialConference and the various governments concerned to cometo a final decision on themethod of carrying out those recommendations, having due regard to the interests ofthe Empire as a whole.(NOTE;   Discretion is left to theGovernment representativesas to the precise wording of the above formula, whichthe C cabinet re c o gnis ed would .require close consideration.)(f) That, subject to the inclusion of a paragraph based on the above formula,the Government representatives should assume reasonable latitude in dealingwith the various matters that might come before the Conference.-(g) That Ministers at the head of Depart-rments should be free to make sugges-tions to the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs and the attorney general on any points of detailarising in connection with anyquestion at the Conference.

The attention of the Cabinet was called toa passage in the Minutes of the Cabinet referredto in the margin on the subject of the Hours ofEmployment Bill, reoording that a Committee had pointed out that, on a strict interpretation ofthe terms of the Washington Convention, theproposed Bill would not allow of immediate ratifica-tion.The Cabinet were informed that there was reasonto believe that the International Labour office would admit that the terms of the Bill were not inconsistent with ratification, and it was suggestedthat the Minister of Labour should take steps to confirm this.    It was further suggested that she should place herself in communication with various.. organisations specially interested inthis question before the Bill is introduced.The Minister of Labour pointed out that theintention of her Memorandum had been to enable her to consult with the interests concerned,including the International Labour Office, but she had desired first to obtain certain decisionsfrom the Cabinet.The Cabinet agreed  That any negotiations in connectionwith the Hours of Employment Billshould be conducted on the assumptionthat the Bill is not inconsistent,with ratification of the WashingtonHours Convention.
