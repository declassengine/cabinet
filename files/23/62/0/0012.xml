The Cabinet bad before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State fur Dominion Affairs (paper c.P.-316 (29)) in regard to the progress of theConference on the Operation of Dominion Legislation^asking for decisions from the Cabinet In regard tothe following points:-(i) The sanction to be given to theagreement reached at the Conferenceon the subject of legislation withregard to the crown,&quot;and certain aspects of Defence legislation:(ii) As to the line he and the Attorney-General should take in regard tothe provisions necessary to safe-guard the position of DominionConstitutions.The Attorney-General explained to the Cabinetin considerable detail the precise issues Which had arisen.   The first point was as to the method bywhich the position of the Crown was to be safeguarded.The Governments Delegates wished to know whetherthey were justified in resting content with anagreement with the Dominions that no member of theBritish Commonwealth of Nations would try and alter the position of the Crown without the consent of allother parts, including, of oourse, the United Kingdom,or, alternatively, were they to insist on themaintenance of the existing British Statute which theDominions regarded as inconsistent with equality ofstatus.In this connection attention was drawn to the precise terms of the formula regarding equality ofstatus agreed to at the Imperial Conference, 1926,as well as to the formula which the Cabinet at a ;;previous Meeting (Cabinet 39 (29), Conclusion 2(e))had suggested that the Delegates should adopt inorder to preserve freedom of the Government at the
Imperial Conference.The second point on which the Attorney-Generalasked for instructions was as to how to deal withthe difficulty that had arisen in regard to theamendment of the Constitutions of the Dominions.Three of the Dominions wished the-iy/Constitutionst-o-be.....-prooorved, while South Africa and tho IrishFree State pe-^voted-the--4d^a-of thoir Oon-g-bltutionsbe-ing rondo rod-^unalt^ab-l-o-.After a discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That, having regard to the difficultConstitutional and political issues involved, the questions relating tothe maintenance of the position &quot;ofthe Crown should be considered, inthe first instance, by the CabinetCommittee already appointed onOctober 7th (Cabinet 37 (29), Con-clusion l(c).), namely:-The Lord Chancellor,The Lord Privy Seal,The Lord President of the Council,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs, andThe Attorney-General,who should do their best to devise a formula and procedure whereby the various governments represented at the conference should avoid being committed in principleor on procedure before the next Sessionof the Imperial Conference, more especially on the questions relating to the Crown.(NOTE.    The Secretary of State forDominion Affairs entered acaveat that, in his opinion,it would not be possible to omit from the Report of theConference some reference tothe facts of the situation,the difficulties that presentedthemselves, and the possiblesolutLans.)Cb) That in dealing with the question ofthe amendment of the Constitutions of dominions the Delegates should bearin mind the desire of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to be committed as little as possible.
5.

On this point the President of the Board ofEducation wished to say that various questions inconnection with the subject are still under con-sideration, that the provision of maintenancegrants Is an integral part of the policy of theGovernment, and that in view of the new charge onthe Local Authorities entailed in giving the allowances the House might rely upon the Exchequernot making a mean contribution.The President of the Board of Education furtherasked the permission of the Cabinet to announce that he would introduce the Bill shortly.Subject to a caveat entered by the PrimeMinister, to the effeot that it was unlikely,having regard to the Parliamentary time-table,that the Bill could be passed during the present session of Parliament, the Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the proposals of thePresident of the Board of Education:(b) That the Bill should be referred tothe Committee of Home Affairs.
