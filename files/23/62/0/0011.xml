THE GOAL The Meeting was held solely for the purposeIIOUSTRY.of considering the situation in the Coal Industry.(Previous The position at the time the Cabinet met, as reference:Cabinet 45 disclosed by the President of the Board of Trade(29) ? Con-conclusion 4.) and the Lord Privy Seal, was as follows:-The proposals of the Government had been communicated to the Miners&apos; Federation as wellas to the Mining Association on October 30th.   OnNovember 1st. a further letter had been sent to both bodies, proposing a joint Conference withrepresentatives of the Mining Association and ofthe Miners&apos; Federation to discuss the proposals.The Mining Association had declined to attend a^oint meeting.    The Miners&apos; Federation had aoceptedand had in fact attended on the previous day atthe time (2-30 p,m. ) specified in the letter ofNovember 1st.    Their general attitude towards theGovernments proposals had been not unfavourable.The Mining Association, though they had not attended the Joint Conference, had also met the Cabinet coal committee on the previous evening.   In spite ofall efforts by the Cabinet Coal Committee to induce them to attend a Joint Conference, they had declined, alleging that they had no authority toenter Into any Joint Conference.    It was known thattheir real reason was that they were apprehensive of being drawn into discussions in regard to wages,whioh they were only prepared to discuss in the districts.    The Owners&apos; representatives were alsoopposed to the Government&apos;s proposals for areduction of hours, which they regarded as disastrous-trous to the mining industry.    Their refusal wasin no way dictated by considerations of Barty politics,
* 4. and they had adopted the same attitude when theprevious Government were in office.The Miners&apos; Federation had been frolding ameeting during the greater part of the dayr, but,in spite of several enquiries by telephone, noinfomaation had been obtained, when the Cabinet met,as to their decision-    During the Meeting, however,at about 7-15 p.m., the following messages were received by telephone.-From Mr A. J.Cook, to the private secretary&apos; t&apos;o^Kr^B^n. Turner[ theSecretary for jZines;-&apos;&quot;The Miners Conference recommendacceptance of the Government planbut are asking districts to directMiner M.P.&apos;s and Federation Execu-tive to endeavour to secure better terms from the Government.    the yorkshire miners, led by Mr HerbertSmith, are opposing the terms.(Signed g.a.Isaacs)B.81 have confirmed the message.    Itis a telephone message from A.J.Cookto Forsyth, the Private Secretaryto the Secretary for Mines.   Mr Cooksaid to Forsyth that the delegate conference had accepted the Govem-departments proposals, with the proviso that the Executive of the Miners&apos;Federation, in conjunction withthe Miners1 M. P. &apos; s, were entrusted with the task of, if possible,Strengthening1 the Government&apos;splan.   They would recommend Districtsaccordingly.    But Herbert Smith andthe South Yorkshire delegates disagreed.(Initialled H.G.V.)*.Before a final decision could be reachedthe Cabinet felt it was necessary to know a littlemore of the exact situation, more particularly as affecting the South Yorkshire miners.
Ji.       JAfter a conversation on the telephone withMr A. JVCook, the President of the Board ofTrade informed the Cabinet that the outlook was less unfavourable than appeared at first sight.The Lancashire and Durham miners had favouredgoing back to the districts without any recommen-dation from the Federation.   The Conference,however, had not accepted that view.   The Govern-ment plan was favoured by the representatives ofall districts except South Yorkshire, subject tosome requests for Improvements which would not,it was anticipated, be very formidable.   ExceptSouthfor the/Yorkshire miners, therefore, the Federa-tion wished the Bill to proceed.   Mr HerbertSouthSmith, the leader of the/Yorkshire miners, was opposed to a recommendation to this effect, andat a certain point had left the Chair, accompaniedby his own delegates, and was returning toYorkshire with the intention of opposing thescheme.    There was, however, no breakaway fromthe Miners&apos; Federation.After a general discussion, in the light ofpledges given to the miners, of their polioy as already decided, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Cabinet Coal Committee,with the addition of the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, should meet Mr A. J. Cook the same evening:(b) That unless the Coal Committee,as the result of the above oon-versatlon, reported adversely,the Coal Bill should be proceeded with.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,November 7, 1929.
