The Cabinet had a short discussion in regardto the attitude which the President of the Boardof Trade should adopt in the House of Commons inregard to the policy approved by the Cabinet thesame morning for transmission to the mining association and the Miners&apos; Federation.    In thisconnection the Cabinet were reminded that thePresident of the Board of Trade had announced inParliament that he would probably be in a positionto make a statement on Thursday, October 31st.\7hile recognising that their confidentialproposals, which must have reached large numbersof persons connected with the mining industry,would probably leak out, the Cabinet neverthelessfelt that it would be a mistake to announce themofficially while the negotiations were still proceeding, and accordingly agreed - That the President of the Board of&apos;Trade should inform the House ofCommons that negotiations with both parties were still proceeding.
SALE OP ARMSAid AMMDNI-TION.(previous reference&apos;.Cabinet 42(29), Con-elusion 7.)2.    The Cabinet had a short discussion in regardto the decision they had taken the same morning in reference to the sale of arms and ammunition, and,while reaffirming that decision, emphasised thatin the disposal of war stores the War Office should avoid any dealings with foreign Governments.    This,however, was not intended to preclude sales to private contractors unless it was known that the stores so purchased were intended for foreign government.
3. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Financial Secretary to the War Office (paper cp.-276 (29)) covering a Memorandum by the ArmyCouncil on the subject of the Arms Traffic Conven-r-tion.    In this Memorandum the Army Council pointedout that the effect of the Convention, whenoperative, would be that Imports of war materialby non-producing States would be given wide publicity and that non-producing States wouldInvariably prefer to avoid publicity by placingtheir orders with those producing States which remain outside the Convention, rather thandisclose information of vital importance to themselves by placing such orders with producingStates which have bound themselves to givepublicity to suoh transactions.In these circumstances, not only to safeguard the interests of our trade and our workpeople,but also to render the Convention itself effective in operation, the Army Council urged that thiscountry should not ratify the Convention untilsimultaneous ratification by all the principalarms-producing States has been assuredoThe Lord President of the Council assured theCabinet that Lord Cecil&apos;s announcement in regardto the intention   of the Government to ratify the Arms Traffic Convention was not inconsistent with the policy urged by the Army Council, andthe Cabinet, while supporting that policy, agreed -That no action was necessary.
EDUCATION.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum the Voluntary-School Problem.by the President of the Board of Education(Paper Op P.-290 (29)) on the subject of the(reference cabinet 20Voluntary School Problem.    In this memorandum the President of the Board of Education reachedthe following conclusion:-I, therefore, propose to adhere to our present position and to replyto all pressure that the labour government are unable to undertaketo alter the settlement of 1902until the main parties interestedhave come to some sort of agreement,and that it is impossible to suggest a partial alteration of the existing system unless the whole policy is agreed upon;   that the experienceof the last 25 years has freededucational progress from thebitterness of the religious contro-versy which marked the precedingdecade;    that the dual system hashowever caused great difficulties and complications for educationaladministrators, while it has failedto satisfy the ardent denomlnation-Nationalists or those who want completepublic control;   that the situationis perhaps one where the good senseand absence of religious bitternessof the present moment might lead tothe evolving of some agreed solution;and that if the Government wereapproached by representatives ofany of the main parties concernedthey would do their best to see whether an authoritative nationalconference could be brought together in the hopes of finding a solution.On the understanding that the 1902 settlement would not be reopened except on the receipt of a-definite g^e-posals f-rem the interested parties, -The Cabinet approved the general lines suggested by the Presidentof the Board of Education.
POLITICALSITUATION ININDIA.(previous reference.Cabinet 37(29), Con-oluslon 4.)5.   The Cabinet gave consideration to a letterfrom Mr Baldwin to the Acting Prime Ministerindicating that he was now opposed to thestatement of policy (which he had previouslyapproved) to be made by the Viceroy on the morrow,and asking that it should be postponed at anyrate until after the Prime Minister&apos;s return.The new factor which had moved Mr Baldwin, afterconsultation with his colleagues, to reverse his previous attitude and to make this request wasthe opposition of Sir John Simon and his Commis-sion which had developed subsequent to Mr Baldwinsagreement to the proposed statement.In the course of full explanations on thesubject the Secretary of State for India and the acting Prime Minister read the correspondence with Mr Baldwin and Sir John Simon, as well asthe telegrams exchanged with the Viceroy.The Secretary of State for India undertook to circulate for information a full account of the somewhat complicated circumstances, includingthe text of the various documents, which accord-in gly are not reproduced in these Minutes.The Cabinet felt that it would be impossible in the time available to make the Prime Ministerfully conversant by cypher radiogram with allthe circumstances of the case, and that theymust themselves take the responsibility of adecision.Having regard to the strong view of theViceroy against any alteration in the statement. and against any delay in its publicationwhich would dislocate a political situation inIndia which had been carefully prepared,
the Cabinet agreed  (a) That there should be no alteration in the programme already approved and that the Secretary of State forIndia should immediately notify theViceroy accordingly:(b) That the Acting Prime minister should make such communication ashe deemed advisable to Mr Baldwinand Sir John Simon to intimate thatthe Cabinet could not agree to therequest for delay, which in ordinarycircumstances would have been a mostreasonable proposal:(o) To leave it to the Acting PrimeMinister and the Secretary of Statefor India to deal with a request fromMr Baldwin (which was received just as the Cabinet was about to disperse)to have a copy for the use of hiscolleagues and himself of the telegram whichwas sent by the Acting Prime Ministerand the Secretary of State for Indiato the Viceroy.
Ed policy.previous reference:1(29), Con-conclusion 1(a).)6.   The Cabinet bad before them a Memorandum bythe President of the Board of Trade (Paper C. P.-289 (29)) in response to the request of theCabinet at the meeting mentioned in the marginthat he should submit proposals for obtainingcompulsory powers for dealing with interests which might persist in charging excessive prices in defiance of recommendations of the proposedConsumers&apos; Council.    Assuming that there will beno opportunity to introduoe the necessary legisla-tion to give effect to the Cabinet7s decision toestablish a Consumers&apos; Council until next year,the President of the Board of Trade suggestedthat it would be sufficient if, in addition to theannouncement which had already been approved bythe Cabinet, he were authorised to inform parliament that the Government have, under consideration theadoption of measures for dealing with trade inter-ests which refuse to accept the views of theGovernment based on recommendations of the consume-ers&apos; Council in regard to the retail prices for the commodities reviewed by the Council.    This wouldgive the further time required for considerationof the details of the machinery to be establised for carrying out the policy of price fixing.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the President of the Board ofTrade.

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum(Paper C.P.-298 (29)) of the decisions of theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofLabour on points referred to them by the Cabinet.After summing up the steps already taken toimprove the finance of the Unemployment fund in order to ensure continued payment of benefit,and their financial effect;    after stating thatthe Chancellor had agreed that the charge on theExchequer in respect of transitional benefit should be dated back to April 1, 1929,and that hewas prepared to agree to improve the scales ofbenefit to young persons, both of which had added to the cost to the Exchequer;   and afterpointing out that by the end of the winter the debt on the Fund might well approach near to thestatutory limit ( 40,000,000) though  it is notto&apos;reach it,likely actuall^the Report stated that the Chancellorof the Exchequer had come to the conclusion thathe could not agree to any increase in theExchequer charge over and above the large sums involved, and that it was accordingly notpossible to provide for the reduction of the waiting period to three days   a view whichthe Minister of Labour reluctantly accepted*The Report further stated that the proposedclause for giving general authority to providetraining and removal expenses would add greatly to the difficulties in the House of Commons andwould therefore have to be postponed until alater occasion.
The Minister of Labour intimated that it might be necessary for her to ask for a Special Meetingof the Cabinet on Monday next for considerationof the Unemployment Insurance Bill, but she was asked to make an effort to circulate the Bill intime for consideration at the Meeting already arranged for Friday afternoon.The Cabinet were warned that the failure ofthe Government to provide for the reduction ofthe waiting period to three days would be veryunwelcome to their own supporters in parliament and that their hand might be forced, as it hadbeen in 1924, by the Liberal Opposition.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, after explaining to the Cabinet the extent of theadditional financial burden, more particularly inconnection with Unemployment Insurance, which theGovernment had already assumed, was unable to alter his decision.Whitehall.
