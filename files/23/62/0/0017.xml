CHINA.MilitaryForces in,(previous reference:Cabinet 50(29), Con-clusion 11.)1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs drew the attention of the Cabinet, as a matter of urgency, to the serious situation in China and tothe statement which he had made in the House ofCommons on the subject on Monday, December 9th(Parliamentary Debates, Vol. 233, No.52, p.15), inthe course of which, in referring to the plans madelocally for the protection of the lives of Britishsubjects, he had mentioned that arrangements arein hand for the transfer of one Battalion from hong-Kong to Shanghai should the situation demandit.    Through an oversight this statement had beenmade \without consultation with the Secretary ofState for &apos;&apos;ar.   Arising out of this incident he had discussed the position in China with the three service Ministers.The Secretary of State for War informed theCabinet that he was not satisfied that the policyof the Government in regard to trouble in china was sufficiently clear,  and he quoted a telegram sent a year or two before indicating that troopsnight have to be sent all over the place in China.In reply to the Prime Minister he stated that the battalion, which the Cabinet had decided could be withdrawn, had not yet moved.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the Ministers at the head ofthe three Service Departments shouldcontinue their review of the situationin China in regard to -(i) the immediate situation:(ii) the general policy as regardsthe distribution of troops .(b) That the Committee of Chiefs of staff should advise the above Ministers on both aspects of the question.
RENEWAL OPARBITRATIONTREATIES .(previous reference:Cabinet 7(29), Con-elusion 1.)2.The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Paper C.P.-359 (29)) on the subject of the renewal of Arbitra-tion Treaties.   It was proposed that it was unneces-aary to renew the Arbitration Treaties with Franceand Italy which have recently expired and which provide for arbitration on justiciable disputesonly, since all three Governments are committed bytheir signature of the Optional Clause to refer to arbitration by the Permanent Court of InternationalJustice the classes of dispute enumerated in the treaties .    It was further pointed out that Denmark,Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, from whichproposals have been received, have also signed the optional Clause and therefore the field ofjusticiable disputes between this country and eachof them will be covered;    and that as regards non-justiciable disputes the field would similarly be covered when we and the countries concerned have become parties to the General Act.   It was pointedout that the policy as regards the General Act isat present under consideration by a Foreign OfficeCommittee, under the Chairmanship of Lord Cecil,and it was suggested to instruct the Committee toconsider simultaneously the possibility of  (Includingbilateral treaties on the lines of the modelBilateral Convention for the Pacific Settlementof all International Disputes with some or all ofthe countries concerned, without waiting for a finaldecision as to the General Act.   The proposal ofthe Foreign Secretary was to proceed on the above lines and to return replies to the five countriesin question explaining the position and indicating the action which His Majesty*s Government are taking.-2-
The Cabinet agreed  -(a) To approve the proposals of theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs as summarised above, bothin regard to France and Italy andto the other five countries:(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should concert with the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs the necessarycommunications to be made to theDominions in connection with carry-ing out his proposals:(c) To take note that the proposals ofthe Foreign Office Committee inregard to the General Act (whichwere being prepared with a viewto action at the next meeting ofthe Assembly of the League of Nations)would be laid before the Cabinet indue course and before action was taken.
ESTIMATESOP THEFIGHTINGSERVICES .Royal AirPoroe Schemefor HomeDefence.(previous reference:Cabinet 2(29), Con-clusion 11-)3 .The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Air (Paper CP.-355 (29))asking the consent of the Cabinet to a retardationof the expansion scheme at present governing thestrength of the Royal Air Force, involving a post-ponement of the completion of that scheme until 1938.The proposal was accompanied by a warning that so farthere has been no indication of any foreign countryfollowing our example    in the provision of airarmaments.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, while accepting the proposals of the Secretary of State for Air,entered a caveat that the postponement of the com-pletion of the Royal Air Force scheme until 1938must not be taken as signifying that any further postponement was debarred notwithstanding what changesmight take place in the general situation, or thatreconsideration of that date was -impossible.The Secretary of State for Air drew attentionto the warnings contained in paragraph 7 of C.P.-355(29) as to the need for setting some limits to ourmoderation in view of the failure of other Powersto follow our example in limiting our air forces.He impressed upon the Cabinet the importance of doing everything possible, when the proper opportunity-nity arose, to induce limitation by other Powers.Subject to the above, and having regard to theeffect of this postponement in strengthening the moral position of our delegates at the Disarmamentdiscussions at the League of Nations at Geneva,  The Cabinet approved the proposal of the Secretary of State for Airfor a retardation of the expansionscheme at present governing thestrength of the Royal Air Force,involving a postponement of thecompletion of that scheme until1938. s-4-
THE POLITICALSITUATION ININDIA.The MeerutConspiracyCase.(previous reference:Cabinet 23(29), Con-elusion 2.)4. The Secretary of Sta-te for India informed the Cabinet that some time ago the Communist party had asked for permission to send out British Counselto India to conduct the defence in the Meerutconspiracy case.   This had been granted.   They had then applied for authority to send a Communistadviser to assist Counsel.   This request had alsobeen granted   in both cases after consultationwith the Government of India.    The Communist party had then nominated Mr Campbell as the Communistadviser, and again, after consultation with the acting Viceroy, permission had been given.   the acting Viceroy had not objected, as, under theprovisions of the Safety Ordinance then in force,Mr Campbell could have been deported if he departedfrom his undertakings..   Two new factors had thenentered into the ease.    First, the Communist party had decided not to send Counsel to India but to employ Indian Counsel.    Second, the Indian situa-tion had so far improved that the Viceroy now hoped to dispense with the Safety Ordinance.    consequently the Government of India would have no power to deportMr Campbell, and, although the latter had given anundertaking not to indulge in propaganda or to behaveimproperly,  it was not felt that his word was entirelytrustworthy.    As the safeguards were being dispensed with the Secretary of State had decided to withdrawpermission for Mr Campbell to proceed to India.The Cabinet endorsed the decision ofthe Secretary of State, and advised that,  if questioned, he should state the whole position quite frankly inthe House of Commons.

The conclusions of the Commit-tee were reported as follows(1) That the subject covering as it doesa large range of miscellaneous occupa-tions of very different kinds, is not susceptible of being dealt with in asingle instrument whether in the shape of a draft Convention or recommenda-tion,(2) That as regards all the occupationsin question, even that of Shop Assist-ants about whose conditions of workmore is known than about those ofthe other classes, the information asto hours, overtime and other conditionsof employment which would be necessaryfor drawing up a workable convention or recommendation is not in the posses-sion of the Government Departments con-cerned.(3) That as regards most of the occupa-tions    e.g., journalists, commercialtravellers, outdoor and indoor amusementemployees,  officials of organisations,etc., the information would be practi-cally impossible to get.The recommendations of the Committee may be summed up as follows:-(a) That the International Labour office should be informed, in reply to the questionnaire, that the government do not think it practicable at thepresent time to go further than a recommendation to the effect thatthe States Members should undertakean inquiry into the conditions of.   employment in the distributive trades:(b) That the Government should.xiot con-template any further undertaking inregard to the regulation of hours ofemployment in the United Kingdom untilthe Hours Bill has been passed andsome experience of its working andeffects in industry has been obtained.
The Cabinet approved the conclusions and Recommendations of the Hours ofEmployment Bill Committee as set forth in C.P.-357 (29) and summarised above.
