THE hague conference,German property in the UnitedKingdom.(PreviousReferenoetCabinet 49(29), Con-elusion 3,)1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that on the previous day hehad had an interview with Dr. Sthamer, the german ambassador, on the subjeot of the liquidation ofGerman property in the United Kingdom and the reservation made by the German Government in annex II of The Hague Protocol concerning theapplication of the Reparation Recovery Actspari passu with Deliveries in Kind after the expiry of the ten-years programme laid down in the Experts1Report.    The Ambassador had handed him aides-memoirson these subjects, which he had forwarded to theChanoellor of the Exchequer, while promising anearly repLy.    The German Ambassador had alsobrought forward the question of the disclosure tothe Press of the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;sletter to the German Ambassador, for which HisExcellency had disclaimed German responsibility.The Cabinet were informed that in regard to the liquidation of German property the gist of theGerman reply was that under duress they wereprepared to cede their olaim to the surplus of 14,000,000 but hoped that the British Governmentwould be generous on some other matters.   As regardsthe Reparation Recovery Acts they were ready toenter into negotiations, and a German representativewas ooming to London to discuss the matter *with the Treasury.In takinr note of the above the Cabinet decidedto record the hope that the question of german propaganda in this country and the disclosure ofthe Chancellor of the Exchequers letter would be cleared up without creating serious friction.
RUSSIA.reviouseferenoe:cabinet 48(29), Con-elusion 5.)The Dominionsand soviet propaganda.2, The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that the Russian SovietGovernment had refused our request that their under-taking to desist from propaganda in the UnitedKingdom on the resumption of diplomatic relations should apply also to the Dominions.    They had pointed out that Canada had broken off relationswithout subsequent resumption, and that betweenother Dominions and the Soviet Government therehad not been, nor were there, any relations.When normal relations had been established betweenthe Soviet Government and the Dominions the formerGovernment wao willing to effect a similar exchangeof Notes with each of them.In this connection the Cabinet were informed thata Question was being asked in Parliament onThursday December 5th.The Secretary of St?to for Dominion Affairs-informed the Cabinet that a meeting between officials and Representatives of the Dominions nowin London had been arranged for the same morning to discuss what action should be taken, and in all probability this Conference would result in atelegram being- sent to the Dominions passing onthe proposal of the Soviet Government.The Cabinet agreed  That the reply to the Question shouldbe to the effeot that the subject was still being negotiated, in consultationwith the Dominians, with the SovietGovernment.It was understood that the special point raised as to Soviet propaganda in theDominions did not affect the undertaking given so far as India was concerned.
cabinet procedure.circulation of Papers.(previous reference:Cabinet 28(29), Con-elusion 1. )3. The Prime Minister called the attention ofthe Cabinet to the practice, that had grown up inentire disregard of the rules laid down by theCabinet itself, of circulating documents forconsideration by the Cabinet on the eve of aMeeting;.    He pointed out that a document circu-lated on the evening before the Meeting stoodvery little chance of being properly examined bymembers of the Cabinet and that Memoranda circu-lated on the moraine- of the Meeting could not,as a rule, receive any consideration whatsoever.He appealed to his colleagues to instruct their departments to comply with the rules of theCabinet and to submit their Memoranda in timefor circulation in accordance with the rules ofprooedure-
retirement pensions.(previous reference:Cabinet 34(29). Con-oluslon 5(a).)4. The Cabinet had before them the following documents in regard to Retirement Pensions:-A Note by the Lord Privy Seal (paper cp.-341 (29)) covering a Report on retirement Pensions prepared by aSub-Committee of the Inter-DepartmentalCommittee on Unemployment.    ThisReport was divided into three sections:-(i) A description of the various schemes which had been exam-ined, which was signed by allthe members of the Comxittee:(ii) An addendum by the Chairman,the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, and the Parlia-mentary Under-Secretary ofState for Scotland:(iii) An addendum by the official members of the Sub-Committee:lA Memorandum by the Government Actuaryon the effect on the Retirement Pen-sions estimates of the provisions ofthe neiir Unemployment Insuranoe Billis attached as an annexure.In his covering note the Lord privy seal suggested that a small Committeeof Ministers should be appointed sothat the Ministers responsible forthe proposals should have an oppor-tunity of stating their case.A Memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (Paper CP.-344 (29))covering a Note, also initialled bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer, onthe Growth of Expenditure.    In thecovering noto it was pointed out thatthe proposals in regard to retirement pensions would put 390,000 peoplepermanently out of work, and providework for only 280,000 substitutes:the 390,000 would be pa.id at a rather higher rate than the 280,000 had been paid, and out of a rather differentfund, viz., a pensions fund insteadof the Unemployment Fund;    the main- financial, difference being that thewhole oost would fall upon theExchequer:A Note by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster (Paper CP.-346 (29))circulated by direction of the lord privy Seal in connection with anannexure to the Report on retirement pensions (Paper CP.-341 (29)).
In the course of the discussion the cabinet were reminded that a Committee had already been set up to consider the question of Social Insurance,and it was suggested that the results of that Inquirymight be sufficiently comprehensive to include thequestion of Retirement Pensions.    On the whole,however, it was felt that it would be better not to add to the labours of this Committee by referringthe latter question.The Cabinet agreed  That the question of retirement pensions, as raised in the Papersbefore the Cabinet, should bereferred to a Committee composed as followst-  The First Lord of the Admiralty(In the Chair),r A Representative of the Treasury,A Representative of the Board ofTrade,and that the&quot; Ministers responsiblefor the proposals should be affordedan opportunity to state their case before the Committee.
5.  In addition to the Report of the CabinetCommittee on the Factories Bill (Paper CP--31-5 (29))which had been before them at their previous Meeting,the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (Paper CP.-317 (29)).This latter Memorandum covered a letter to thePresident of the Board of Trade from the First Lordof the Admiralty, who had presided at a meeting ofthe Sub-Committee of the Committee of Civil research on the Cotton Industry to consider the effect onthat industry of the removal of the t^o-shift system.In this letter the view of the Sub-Committee was expressed that so far as the Cotton Industry isconcerned the time is not ripe for legislativechanges in regard to the two-shift system, and thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government should take no steps, by legislation or otherwise, which xTOuld seriouslyincrease the difficulty of developments on the linesnow contemplated in the industry.The Cabinet also had under consideration a supplementary Memorandum by the Home Secretary(Paper CP.-333 (29)) In regard to the Two-shift system, summarising the points in favour of thesystem as follows:-(i) It gives more employment.(ii) It reduces the hours of work from48 or more to 41 or 42 in almost all cases.(iii) It enables pressure of work andother emergencies to be met without&quot; overtime.(iv) It is a means of bringing downoverhead charges and decreasingcost of production.(v) It makes it possible to employ women on work which is suitable for them in. oases where otherwise men would haveto be employed at a greater cost, e. g. ,in a department where two shifts arenecessary in order to preserve thebalance with preceding or succeedingprocesses In other departments.-6-
In a further Memorandum by the Home Secretary(Paper CP.-333 (29)) it was pointed out that theprovisions of the Hours of Employment Eill in regardto overtime were not likely to be decided for some weeks at the very earliest, and that some early decision was required to avoid the Factories bill being held up.    As a provisional solution of the overtime difficulty, therefore, the Home secretary proposed In the Bill, as Introduced, to limit theright to work overtime to industries or processesin which overtime was recognised by a collective agreement between organisations representative ofemployers and workers in the industry or processconcerned, or by an award as to wages or conditionsof work in the industry or process or in whichovertime is sanctioned by an Order of the Secretaryof State for the industry or process so that the overtime would no longer depend upon the unrestriet-ed discretion of the employer.    The limit to beplaced on the amount of overtime to be workedwould be as already?/- proposed, viz., an average,,taken over a year, of 2 hours a week, and theworking of overtime would be subject to the same conditions as in the existing Act, namely, thatthe employers would have to report to the Inspectorand enter in a register at the factories particulars of the overtime on each occasion before workingthe overtime, and also to keep a notice of the overtime posted up in the factory.    This procedure,it was pointed out, would enable the Pome Secretaryto proceed with the introduction of the Bill and atthe same time would leave the question of overtimeopen to further consideration at a later stage Ifthe Cabinet should come to the decision on the PoursBill&apos;that wider provisions in regard to overtime
were required in view of the exigencies of industry.The Cabinet agreed -(a) AS REGARDS THE TWO-SHIFT SYSTEM;That no proposal should be includedin the Factories Bill either tosupport or to continue that system,and that steps should be taken indue course to terminate the existingtwo-shift provisions, e. g., in the expiring Laws Continuance Bill of19501AS REGARDS OVERTIME:    That the pro-vlsions In the Factories Bill mustbe consistent with the WashingtonConvention, and that, subject tothis over-riding factor, the HomeSecretary1s proposals should be approved.(b)
1 LORDif0F:&apos;Sevlousiferenoe.&apos;.flbinet 4919). Con-fusion 4.)6. The Cabinet had before them a Report, prepared in the Treasury and circulated by direction ef theChancellor of the Exchequer (Paper C. P.-326 . (29)),on the subject of the Coalfields Distress Fund, theconclusions of ^hich are summed up in paragraph XTTTas followst-(l) The organisation of the Lord Mayor&apos;sFund has on the whole successfullymet the special circumstances of itscreation, but it overlaps with theorganisation of the Boards of guardians and is not a highlyefficient piece of machinery.(2) Although only  600,000 is likely tobe spent In the mining areas in thecoming winter compared with  900,000in the first six months of this year,the sum available will go very much further with improved administrationthan it would have done last winter,and the sum expended last winterincluded provision to meet distressaccumulated over a number of years.(3) If assistance is to be normallyrestricted to families of unemployed and not extended to families of menat work, the sum required is not likely to be enormous, since in manyoases the margin between the two classes is not very wide.(4) The needs of Durham, Northumberlandand Sjuth Wales as estimated by the divisional Committees of the Fund inthose, areas are likely to be met infull.(5) There has been a marked improvementin employment in those areas, whereas the situation in the other mining areas is generally unchanged, and inthe country as a whole it shows adecline.(6) The restriction of the Lord Mayor&apos;sFund, by the terms of its appeal, tothe mining areas has created manyserious anomalies and potential hard-ships,      . which would be aggravatedif further large sums were made avail-able on th- same terms.(7) There is already a marked tendency inthese areas to look upon the existenceOf the Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund or someEquivalent as a permanent arrangementprovidinp- as of right assistance to persons who in other parts of thecountry are left to meet their responsibilities unaided.(8) The Central Committee is unlikely toadvise the Lord Mayor to reopen theFund and commence a fresh appeal.-9-
a e% oZZ4In addition, the Cabinet, had under -consideration a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Sootland(Paper CP.-342 (29)) in which it was stated thatthe whole of the money available in Scotland, withthe exception of a balance of  10,000, which includes a sum of  5,000 retained by the central committee to meet any undisclosed liabilities, was distributed to the Local Committees by about theend of August and payments to beneficiaries ceasedon the 13th September last.   As far as distress inthe Scottish coalfields is concerned, the Secretaryof State expressed the opinion that it is likely tobe similar to what it was last winter, and thatif it is to be met a sum of at least  100,000would be necessar:/ to tide the mining community overthe next five months.    He did not anticipate that another appeal to the Soottish public for furthersubscriptions to assist distress in the mining areas would meet with any degree of success.The Cabinet ^ere informed that some of theLocal Authorities concerned were unable to satisfytheir obligations under existing legislation or totake advantage of Government offers, owing to their financial indebtedness, whether or not this was due in some cases to their own action.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the conclusions reached inthe Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s-   Memorandum (Paper CP.-326 (29)) asquoted above:(b) That no special provision could bemade in the case of Scotland. j

APPENDIX.LAND DRAINAGE - RATING. PROVISIONS.SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS OF COMMITTEE.1.     The Committee see no difference between regarding mainriver drainage as a service and any other service for whichrates have to be levied, and they -recommend, therefore, thatthe proposed Catchment Area Authorities should precept for part of their revenue on the County and County borough councils, who will raise the sums required in the same way as they raise their other rates.     Agricultural land would thus escape paying altogether, and factories would only payone quarter rates.2.     The Committee recommend that, &quot;In addition, the CatchmentArea Authorities should levy, by precept on the InternalDrainage Authorities, a benefit rate on the lowland portionof their district.     Where any portion of this area is not under an Internal Authority, the Catchment Area authority should have po&quot;er to set one up.      The Internal authority would collect these rates together with their   own internalrates, and r?ould continue to levy their rates on acreage orannual value at their own discretion, as at present.3.     The Committee contemplate that it will be necessary forsome limit to be fixed to the amount that can be raised bymeans of Rate (1) and Rate (2) above.f::]&quot;ft   ftft: -ft&apos; .   -\ - a (II &apos;$   - i &apos;: . -4.     The Committee recommerrt that, if Rate (2) is levied onthe basis of annual value, agricultural land should be taken at its full value, railways at the value of the land on either side, and other hereditaments at one third their value, this being the practice now adopted.     If, on the other hand,Rate (2) Is levied on the basis of acreage, the Internal(i)
Authority should be empowered to levy its rates onhereditaments other than agricultural land at some suitable proportion of the acreage charge In the poimd.5.     The Committee recommend that where an-InternalAuthority has to levy rates, either for its own purposesor as the result of a precept by the Catchment   area authority, on an urban area, it should be permissible foran arrangement to be made under which the Urban authority would pay to the Internal Drainage Authority a sumequivalent to that which the latter would raise by ratingthe urban area/     Although this would mean that agricultur-al land and factories within such urban area would obtainthe relief afforded by the Local Government Act, 1929,the amount at stake would be small, compared with thesimplification which would be effected.6i     The Committee observe that the general Rate (1) above will constitute a new fate within the meaning: of Section135 of the Local Government Act, 1929, and local authorities will no doubt raise the cfuestion of some contribution beingmade by the Exchequer towards the new burden, which is not likely to be large.
