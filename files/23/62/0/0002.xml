OPERATION OFI DOMINIONLEGISLATIONAND MERCHANT? SHIPPINGLEGISLATION.(previous reference:Cabinet 35(29), Con-* elusion 5.)1.    This subject had been placed on the Agendaat the request of the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs, but no documents were circulated.The Attorney-General made a long statement tothe Cabinet regarding some of the subjectsthat arelikely to be raised at the Conference to begin onthe following day on the Operation of dominion legislation and Merchant Shipping Legislation.Among tho points he mentioned were the follow ing:-(i) THE SUCCESSION TO THE THRONE. The Attorney-General understood that the Irish Free State repre-sentatives might be expected to point out thatHis Majesty was not. only King of England &quot;but also of Ireland, and that consequently, in accordancewith the doctrine of equality of status laid downby the Lmperial Conference, 1926, the Free StateParliament was entitled to legislate on the matter.This would raise all sorts of difficulties, includingthe question of the Protestant Succession.(ii) THE POWER OF&apos; DOMINIONS TO ALTS]- THEIR OWNCONSTITUTIONS, on which the Attorney-Generalexplained tho point of view of Australia, Canada,South Africa and the Irish Free State.(iii) THE STATUS OF THE JUDICIAL COMMITTEE OFTHE PRIVY COUNCIL.    This topic was not-directlywithin the terms of reference to the Conferencebut would arise immediately out of the question ofthe power of disallowance which legally His Majestypossesses in regard to Dominion legist ation.    the attorney-General pointed out the connection between this question and the recent exemption at Genevafrom the oprtation of the Optional Clause of inter-Imperial disputes, which at once gave rise to thepossibility of setting up some kind of ImperialCourt of Appeal.
After a prolonged discussion the cabinet agreed  (a) To draw the special attention ofthe Delegates at the Conference onThe Operation of Dominion Legisla-tion and Merchant Shipping Legisla-tion to their previous decision onthe subject, namely:- \&quot;That the Secretary of Stave forDominion Affairs should treat the Conference as advisory tothe Imperial Conference^ and though he should consult Govern-ment Departments in regard to anyproblems that might arise, heshould be careful not to commit the Government at the present stage&quot;.Cb) That the Delegates should from timeto time, when&quot;they deemed necessary,seek further guidance from their colleagues on &quot;the suggestions thatmight arise at the Conference.(c) That, in order to ensure that the^Delegates should be able to obtain some guidance at short notice inoases where there was no time to consult the Cabinet, the following ministers should act as a Committeeto confer with them:-The Lord Chancellor,The Lord President of the Council,The Lord Privy Seal.(d) That in regard to the question ofthe Succession to the Throne, theDele putes should do their utmost toensure the maintenance of the existing law and should not agree to any alter-ation therein.(e) That the Lord President of the council should arrange with the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs for some form of representation at the Confer-ence of the Privy Council, whetherby watching-brief or otherwise,whenever matters affecting theCouncil or the Judicial Committee  ,were liable to arise.(f) That in his Opening Address the attorney-General should be careful to avoid committing himself to any constitutional innovation, such asthe transfer to an Imperial Courtof Appeal of any part of thefunctions of the Privy Council.
