[EPARATIONS ANDUTER-ALLIEDEBTS .or th cominginternationalonference.previous reference:Cabinet 38(31), Gon-clusion 8.)1.   The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs gave the Cabinet an account of his proceedings during his recent visit to Paris.    The original object ofthis visit was in connection with the ColonialExhibition, but on the very first day events inGermany and their reaction in London had compelledhim to undertake important negotiations.   He announced his intention of circulating a Memorandum on thesubject, and it is consequently unnecessary to summar-ise his report in the Cabinet Minutes .   He read atelegram he had received that morning from theBritish Ambassador in Paris (No.187) containing theresults of the final conversation between German andFrench Ministers, which were inconclusive.    He addedthat the German Ministers had expressed great dis-appointment at the postponement of the visit of thePrime Minister and himself to Berlin, and hoped thatit would nevertheless take place as soon as possible.The Prime Minister gave the Cabinet, in confidence,an account of a satisfactory conversation he had justhad with Mr&apos;i Stimson, the United States Secretary ofState.After discussing the statements referred to above,the Cabinet agreed  (a) To leave the conduct of the negotia-tions at the International conference to the Prime Minister, the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, on theunderstanding that if any new question -of principle should arise the PrimeMinister would consult the Cabinet:&quot;(b) That, in reply to a Private notice question, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should state that onthe subject of Reparations and Inter-Allied Debts he had   nothing
to add to his previous statements, andthat, as the House was aware, a Confer-once was meeting the same afternoon toconsider the financial situation inGermany.(NOTE:    It was also arranged that the PrimeMinister and the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs should meet the train by which the various Delegationswere due to arrive.)
UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCE.(previous reference:Cabinet 35(31), Con-clusion 4.)3.The Cabinet had before them the Conclusionsof the 11th Meeting of the Unemployment InsuranceCommittee (CP.-180 (31)) containing the following recommendations for carrying out undertakings bythe Minister of Labour and the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs in the Debate in the House ofCommons on tine Committee Stage of the UnemploymentInsurance (No.3) Bill on July 15, 1931:-(l) That an official amendment to omitsection 1 (2)  (a) of the Bill shouldbe prepared in readiness to be handed in on the evening of July 20th forconsideration on the Report Stage ofthe Bill on July 21st.(2) That the Minister of Labour should circulate to the members of theCommittee the draft of a statement to be made by her on the Report stage of the Bill, explaining on the lines agreed at the meeting, the Government&apos;sreasons for the deletion of Section 1(2)(a) .(3) That the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs and the Minister of Labour should confer on the matter with members of theLiberal Opposition and certain supporters of the Government,  including Messrs Dukesand Grenfell.The Cabinet also had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Labour (CP.-181 (31)) explaining thatthe Chancellor of the Exchequer had intimated hisdissent from the conclusions reached by the Committeeand had -asked that an alternative clause should besubmitted for consideration.    In accordance with this request a draft clause was attached to the memorandum as Appendix I.   The effect of this draft would be thatthe power to reduce benefit on account of earnings would be limited to cases where the earnings bothin the preceding calendar week and on the averagein the preceding four weeks exceeded one and a halftimes (or twice) the claimant&apos;s rate of benefit-3-
(including dependants&apos; benefit) for a full week.Further, the deduction from benefit is not to exceedhalf the excess of the average earnings for the four weeks over one and a half times (or twice) the claimants rate of benefit for a full week.    (One anda half times&quot; and &quot;twice&quot; were alternatives submitted for consideration.)After indicating the differences between thedraft clause and the clause as printed in the Bill,the Memorandum explained that the draft would of courselimit very considerably the potential restrictions onbenefit as compared with the existing clause.    Howfar it would limit the restrictions which would inpractice be found possible must be a matter of uncertainty.   Moreover, it was scarcely possible togive any estimate of its financial effect.In the course of the discussion the Minister ofLabour pointed out an omission in the re-draft of clause 1(2) (a) in Appendix I to CP.-181 (31).   TheClause should read as follows (the new words are\mderlined) :-&quot;(a) Persons who during the period of fourconsecutive calendar weeks ending inthe benefit period have been, umemployed for one or more.days in each such weekand .have received per week on the average,,and in the calendar week so ending have actually received earnings or similarpayments to an amount equal to one anda half times (twice) the full benefit&quot;.There was no disagreement that it was the inten-tion of the Cabinet to render liable, after investi-gation, to exclusion from Unemployment Benefitcertain classes of persons who are habituallyemployed for only a small part of the week and who receive substantial wages and have no intention ofworking on other days .   It was stated that special provision was made in the regulations of some
Trades Unions for excluding persons in this categoryfrom benefits payable by the Union.   The Cabinet were informed, however, that up to the present it had notbeen found possible to draft a clause to give effectto the intention of the G-overnment without openingto investigation the case of large numbers of workersv/ho, owing to the exigencies of their trade, were compelled to work short time.The Cabinet were informed that the subject wasto be discussed the same afternoon with representa-tives of the Liberal Party.The Prime Minister invited the Minister of Labour,in consultation with other Ministers concerned, tocontinue her efforts to find a satisfactory formula,bearing in mind that the Act would be put in operation by Regulation.   He expressed the hope that on no account would these particular cases of anomaliesbe allowed to continue owing to the admitted diffi-culty of finding a correct phraseology.
(JTORAL 3 . The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary (CP.-178 (31)) reporting, after,resenta-n of the further enquiries, as to the position of the Repre-pie Bill.sentation of the People (No.2) Bill under theevious Parliament Act .ference:binet 38 Three administrative amendments are required to1), Con-conclusion 3.) postpone temporarily the coming into operation ofthree clauses, and a fourth amendment in order to insert in the Bill a schedule setting out the constituencies exceeding in area 400 square miles inwhich the limitation on the number of motor-cars thatmay be used at an election will not apply.   One ofthe amendments, namely, that postponing until thenext General Election the reduction in the scale of candidates&apos; expenses,was to be proposed by theGovernment in the House of Lords on Third Reading.Whether this amendment was accepted or not by the lords did not affect the position under the Parlia-ment Act.The other administrative amendments related toclauses which had been deleted by the Lords, and parliamentary Counsel advised that the position with regard to them is as follows:-&quot;On the assumption that agreementbetween the two Houses is not out ofthe question and that the Bill willpass this Session, the procedure willbe that the Commons will disagree tothe deletion by the Lords of the clauses in question, and, on so doing,will propose (as consequential on therestoration of these clauses to theBill) the administrative amendments which it is desired to make in the clauses.   The Commons make no alter-ation to the Bill itself, but sendback to the Lords a statement oftheir &apos;Reasons for disagreeing to the lords Amendments&apos; and of amendments which the Commons propose in conse-quence of the restoration of the-6-
clauses to the Bill.    If the Lordsaccept the restoration of the clauses,they will presumably accept the amend-ments proposed by the Commons to the clauses, as these amendments involve no question of principle.If no agreement is reached betweenthe two Houses, steps will have to betaken to pass the Bill by means of the parliament Act.    In that case, it willbe impossible to get the amendmentsmade this Session.   This being so,the Bill must next Session be sent up to the House of Lords in exactly the same form as that in which itwas sent up this Session, except for including any amendments made by the lords this Session which the Commonsaccept, and the Commons will then beable under the proviso to sub-section(4) of Section 2 of the Parliament Act %to suggest the amendments which they desire without inserting them in theBill;    if these amendments are agreed by the Lords, they can then be inserted in the Bill when it is sent up to the lords in the third Session&quot;.The Home Secretary asked the Cabinet to decide whether they wished to press the issue between thetwo Houses of Parliament to a conclusion before theHouse adjourns for the Slimmer Recess.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That considerations of parliamentary time made it extremely difficult, ifnot impossible, to deal with thequestion of the Lords&apos; Amendments tothe Representation of the People bill before the House adjourned for the summer Recess;    and that, unless theresult of the discussion on the subject with representatives of the liberal party on the following day rendered itnecessary, to re-consider the matter,the amendments shoiild be dealt with assoon as possible after the re-assemblyof Parliament:(b) That the amendment postponing untilthe next General Election the reductionin the scale of candidates&apos; expensesshould not be proposed by the Governmentin the House of Lords on Third Reading.
XT MEETING 4.     Owing to the International Conference on cabinet.the financial situation in Germany, the weekly meetingof the Cabinet on Wednesday, July 22nd, was postponed.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,July 20, 1931.
