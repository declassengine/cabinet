With reference to the conclusion referredto in the margin, the Cabinet received from theChancellor of the Exchequer an accountof the meeting which had taken place on theprevious evening between the Cabinet Committee onthe Report of the Committee on National expenditure and a Committee of the General Council of theTrades Union Congress.      The meeting had beena friendly one, and Mr. Citrine, who acted asspokesman for the Committee, pointed out that inthe view of the General Council,  the Governmenthad been mistaken in their method of approaching the problem.     All through his statement,and inthe subsequent discussion, it appeared that themembers of the General Council had no realappreciation of the seriousness of the situation;the statements made appeared to be based on a pre- -crisis mentality, and the objections raised to the proposals were those which members of theCabinet themselves would have taken had thecircumstances been quite normal.     With regard tothe suggested economies, Mr. Citrine had stated thatthe General Council were opposed to any interferencewith the existing terms and conditions of theUnemployment Insurance Scheme, including thelimitation of benefit to 26 weeks.     Any measuresof retrenchment in respect of Unemployment Insurancewould be strongly opposed, and the same applied tothe suggested&apos;economies on Teachers&apos; salaries andthe pay of men in the Fighting Services, as these
reductions would, in the view of the Council,encourage employers to make a serious attackon wages.     In the course of the discussion,Mr. Bevin had taken a more moderate line withregard to Teachers&apos; salaries, and had urgedthat any reduction should be effected as a resultof negotiations between the Parties.The General Gouncil were wholly opposedto any suggestions for reducing expenditure on road and other works in relief of unemployment,and on the contrary pressed for the largest possible extension of a public works policy,provided the works themselves were ofan economic character.     The only proposal towhich the General Council were not completelyopposed was the suggestion that the salaries ofMinisters and Judges should be subjected to a cut.The General Gouncil were of opinion that all therevenue required could be obtained by additionaldirect taxation plus a suspension of the SinkingFund.     With regard to a revenue tariff, theCouncil had the matter under consideration, and proposed to submit a Resolution to the Trades UnionCongress on the subject.The Chancellor of the Exchequer added thathe had replied to the points raised at some length,but that it must be realised that the TradesUnion General Council were not prepared toaccept the scheme of economies which had beenprepared by the Government.
The Prime Minister informed the Cabinetthat in view of the attitude adopted by theGeneral Council, he had thought it necessary tosee the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England.The Deputy Governor had expressed the opinionthat arrangements for balancing the Budget withoutrecourse to very substantial economies would havea most detrimental effect on the situation.If half the estimated deficit could be met byeconomies, this might have the desired effect,but he was sure that to meet only one-third ofthe deficit by economies    would fail to attainthe object, in view.      It was in the Deputy Governor&apos;view essential, particularly from the point of viewof the foreign interests concerned, that very substantial economies should be effected onUnemployment Insurance.      In no other way couldforeign confidence be restored.      The deputy governor had also impressed upon the Prime minister the great dangers of further delay, and had reported the views of a distinguished and veryfriendly foreign financier on the vital need ofour securing budgetary equilibrium by bringing ourandexpenditure within our revenue,/by abstaining fromfromborrowing and/Using capital as income.After revising the ways in which thefinancial and political situation might develop in the immediate future,  the Prime Ministerexpressed the opinion that it was essential thatthe machinery of Government should be fullymaintained pending the reassembling of Parliament,
so as to insure that swift and decisive action could be taken at any moment, should the need arise,and that accordingly it was imperative that theGovernment should remain in office.      The best solution, if possible, would be to decide, inagreement with all concerned, upon some programme which, if carried in effect, would satisfy theneeds of the situation.     The danger was that any premature leakage of proposals which had not beenaccepted in advance as adequate by those in aposition to judge might precipitate the verycrisis which they were desirous of averting.     Inthese circumstances the Prime Minister consideredthat the best course would be for the Governmentto proceed with their programme, and include in it sufficient economies to restore public confidence and so enable the position to bere-established.      In any case it would be necessaryto inform the General Council of the Trades UnionCongress that the Government regretted that therewas no alternative but to proceed with theirprpgramme.After considerable discussion, the cabinet agreed  (i) To take note of and adopt thepolicy outlined by the PrimeMinister and summarised above;(ii) To review the proposals as awhole with a view to bringing them into conformity with the conditions laid down by the Prime Ministerinter alia that they must satisfy the needs of the situation.

He remarked that his view of thematter had apparently been shared by the Deputy Secretary, asevidenced by the entry in the Cabinet Conclusions.Notwithstanding the opposition of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, the Cabinet decided that the premium shouldflot be added to the Unemployment Insurance economies in

CP. 203 (31) Revise.Strictly speaking, this modification ofCabinet 43 (31) should have formed the subject matter ofa separate conclusion in Cabinet 44 (31)$ but at the time it seemed more convenient to effect the alteration bymeans of a corrigendum notice, which was accordingly issued on the 22nd August.Deputy Secretary.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.26th August, 1931.
JKDITURE.;vious Reference;pet 41 (31)elusion 2(2).employmentjorance..R.2.(A)In accordance with the precedingConclusion the Cabinet reviewed the proposals setout in Paper CP. 205 (51) with regard to which decisions had &quot;been reached at the meeting referredto in the margin.    In regard to Economies     some discussion took place on a suggestion that as atemporary emergency measure, a reduction of 5 or10 per cent, should he made in all unemploymentinsurance benefits, other than children&apos;s benefit.As an alternative to the 5 or 10 per cent, reductionit was suggested that the reduction might be Id. inthe l/-.    The Cabinet were informed that on a live register of 5,000,000 a reduction of 5 percent, would produce a saving on ordinary benefits of  4,500,000and on Transitional Benefit of  2,000,000, making 6,500,000 in all.     Prom this there would fall yobe deducted a sum of about  575,000 if the children&apos;benefit was not subject to any reduction.    A reductionof 10 per cent, would double these figures andwould, therefore,  give a net saving of about 12,250,000.Bor the effect of these reductions on individual benefits, see Appendix.The Cabinet were also informed that theaverage cost of living in 1929 was 164 points, asagainst 145 on the 1st August   last.     this represented a fall of 19.points, or ll-g-%.    An allround cut in benefit of ll-g$ would give a totalsaving of about  15,000,000.
jasitionalBefit.3 1 9*J wThe Cabinet were not, however, prepared to takethe fall in the cost of living mentioned above as the basisor to reduce benefit by ll-g- percent.    It appeared, however,that while there was little support for a reduction of5 per cent, in benefit (owing to its comparatively smallfinancial effect) the Cabinet were almost equally dividedon the question whether there should be a reduction of10 per cent, or no reduction of benefit at all.In these circumstances the Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that his only reason for proceeding withthe remainder of a review of the proposals before theCabinet was in order that he might he in a position tosubmit the scheme as a whole to the Leaders of theOppesition Parties and Representatives of the Bank ofEngland later in the day.With reference to Cabinet 41 (31) Conclusion 2, theCabinet agreed -To adopt Conclusions 3 and 4 of the Report of thespecial Cabinet Committee (paper CP. 204 (31))as follows:-That a needs test he applied by the Ministryof Labour through such local machinery asmay be devised to persons not entitled to ordinary benefit.    Estimated saving  5m.per annum.That insured persons in work should he required to pay an additional contribution of 2d, (making a total of 1/-) towards thecost of the scheme mentioned in the procedingparagraph.    Estimated additional revenue 4m. per annum.ation.       (B.)After some discussion the Cabinet agreed -(a) To   modify       their previous decision(Cabinet 41 (31) Conclusion 2 (b)) by substituting as the economy to he effectedon the Education Vote for England and wales figure of  9,400,000 for the figure of 11,400,000 named in that Conclusion.(h) That a corresponding reduction should bemade in the case of the Vote for theScottish Education Department,which reduction should accordingly be 1,300,000 instead of  1,500,000 as statedin the Cabinet Conclusion referred to above.(c) That the President of the Board of education and the Secretary of State for Scotland should
endeavour to secure the reduction of teachers&apos; salaries by negotiation.Ministry (C) The Cabinet maintained their previous Conclusionsof transport and other      as set out in Cabinet 41 (31) Conclusion 2 under theDepartments.FightingServices.Ministryof Health.Derating,etc.economies.headings, Roads, Police, Forestry, Unemployment GrantsxCommittee, Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries   (Englandand Wales), Agriculture (Scotland), Empire MarketingBoard, Colonial Development, and Miscellaneous Votes and services.(D) With regard to the cuts on the Votes of theFighting Services, the Cabinet agreed that the grossaggregate figure should remain at  9,000,000 and were informed by the Secretary of State for War and the FirstLord of the Admiralty that while they would endeavour tosecure their share of this figure for 1952, theycould hold out no hope of repeating it in subsequent years.(E) The Minister of Health informed the Cabinet thatit might be possible to secure a reduction of  1,000,000out of the  1,7 00,000 on the Vote of the Ministry ofHealth without touching housing.   To insist on a further 700,000 cut would mean the cessation of buildingsubsidies with consequential increase of unemploymentin the building industry.The suggestion was made that very considerablesavings could be effected if an appeal was made in thepresent emergency to local authorities to forego someof the benefits accruing to them under the Derating Act.The Minister of Health undertook to meet the Local-Authorities and to endeavour &quot;to realise the maximum possibleamount of savings by recourse to this and other expedients.The Cabinet took note of this undertaking and, in affirmingx   The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries requested theCabinet to take note that the figure submitted by his department to the Treasury was not  600,000 but  534,000.
their previous decision with regard to a reduction of 1,700,000 on this Vote expressed the hope that this figure would he substantially increased by deratingand other adjustments.Note.    At this point the Cabinet adjournedand resumed at 2.15 p.m.On the resumption of the meeting of the Cabinet,there was handed round a document (paper CP. 203 (31)Revise) containing the various alterations which had resulted from the Conclusions of the Cabinet reachedsince this Paper was first circulated.    At the conclusionof the meeting all the copies of this revised documentwere handed to the Deputy Secretary.linking (F)       The Cabinet discussed at some length a suggestionhind.relative to the Sinking Fund.    In view of the Govern-menfs contractual obligations it was recognised thatit would be impracticable to suspend the Sinking Fundaltogether, and it was suggested by those in favour ofthe proposal    that the amount involved might beobtained by borrowing and that the amount so borrowedshould be added to the debt.    This, of course, wouldinvolve an annual charge for interest.After the Chancellor of the Exchequer had warned the Cabinet of the serious consequences of the proposal,and of its utter impracticability if economies of theorder contemplated by the Cabinet were adopted, theCabinet agreed -That for the purpose of their presentcalculations the possibility of deducting 47^ million in respect of the SinkingFund from the gross deficiency should betaken into account. V;
9 0  6 3dRevenue (G-)       In the course of discussion it was representedTariff.that since the last discussion of this question toythe cabinet  the situation had completely altered toyreason of the rejection toy the Litoeral Party of anysuch expedient and toy the acceptance in principle of the suspension of the Sinking Fund which it was claimedrendered recourse to a Revenpe Tariff unnecessary.    Therewas considerable support for the view that the RevenueTariff should toe excluded from the proposals if, and only if, no further economies were made in regard to Unemploy-ment Insurance.      In reply to the Chancellor of theExchequer, who expressed the strongest possitole otojectionto the Government toeing committed in any way to theprinciple of a Revenue Tariff, the Prime Minister statedthat it would toe clearly understood that no decision ofany kind had been reached on the subject of a RevenueTariff.(H)       The Prime Minister stated that he would at oncesubmit to the Leaders of the Opposition Parties and theRepresentatives of the Bank of England the proposals as setout in CP. 203 (31) Revise, with the addition of 4=5$ the suggested Sinking Fund proposal, and (to) the *promittmJprnpngal  macteg  t&amp;e faea44ag nnpmplnympnt, Triffnranne,.    Therewould not, however, toe included in the proposals any reference to a reduction of Unemployment Insurance benefit or to a Revenue Tariff in view of the failure to reach agreement,  in regard to the acceptance of those two proposals.The cabinet  agreed -(a)   To approve the procedure suggested toythe Prime Minister as summarised above.(to)   That a general statement should toe issued to the effect that a scheme toy which the
the Budget vrould &quot;be balanced -would bebrought before Parliament as soon as possible.(c)To request the Prime Minister, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer and with parliamentary Counsel,  to make all necessary arrangements with regard to the reassemblingof Parliament.(d) That consideration should be given to the praticability of including the whole ofthe proposals in a single Bill with a viewto expediting the passage of the measuresinto law.(e) That a written reply shouldbe sent to a letterreceived that day by the Prime Minister fromthe Trades Union Congress General Council.(f) That the Prime&apos;Minister should undertake toinform Ministers, other than Cabinet Ministers,of the proposed cuts in Ministerial emoluments.(g) That for the present Ministers should arrange to be available in case a further meeting ofthe Cabinet had to be summoned to deal withany special emergency.*   Later in the day it was decided that no statementof any kind should be published that evening.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.22nd August,  1931.

CABINET    42  QjJ..The Prime Minister, who had no opportunityof reading these draft Conclusions,  instructedme to send them out with the usual notice tothe effect that they had not been seen by him.I felt some little doubt as to including inConclusion 1  the account of the conversations which had taken place between Ministers and theLeaders of the Opposition Parties, and I took theopportunity of mentioning the matter to the Chancellorof the Exchequer, and of telling him that I could,of course, keep a secret record of these conversations in the Cabinet Offices and make a statement to that effect in the Cabinet Conclusion itself.      On theother hand,  in view of the fact that Lord Passfieldwas not present at the meeting of the Cabinet onThursday evening, August 20th, and also of thefact that it might be convenient to Ministers tohave before them a note of these conversations,there was much to be said for including them in theCabinet Conclusion itself.The Chancellor of the Exchequer had no doubtwhatever that the second course should be adopted, andhe instructed me to incorporate the conversations inthe Cabinet Conclusion, and informed me that he wouldtake full responsibility for this decision.21st August,  19 51 .
