ff&amp; f&quot; f*&quot;S &apos;31.    In pursuance of the Conclusion referred ecuto in the margin,  the Cabinet met to receive areport from the Prime Minister in regard to the reply of the Bankers.     After reminding the Cabinetthat the Chancellor of the Exchequer and himself had seen the representatives of the Bank of Englandon the previous afternoon, and had ascertained from them that after getting in touch with Mr. Harrisonthey would communicate with him again, the PrimeMinister informed the Cabinet that he had received at 10.0 p.m. on the previous evening a telephone message from Sir E. Harvey, to the effect that Mr.Harrison had expressed his own personal opinion that,if a further  20 millions gross was added to the list of economies, made up as to  12^ millions bya 10^ reduction in Unemployment Insurance benefit and as to  7f millions in other ways, the proposals as a whole would be satisfactory from the point ofview of the proposed loan, but that he must firstconfer with the financial interests responsible for raising the money in New York.     Meetings for thispurpose had been held that day (August 2^rd* in new york and London, and although no answer had yet beenreceived from New York it was confidently expected thata reply would come in a little later in the evening.The Prime Minister added that he had not again seen the Leaders of the Opposition Parties, but he reminded the Cabinet that those Leaders had undertaken tosupport the proposals if the latter were satisfactory to the financial interests.The Prime Minister then informed the Cabinetthat he had seen His Majesty and had advised him to
acquaint himself with the views of the Leaders of theConservative and Liberal Parties on the situation.The question before the Gabinet was whether,  in theevent of the reply from New York being satisfactory,they were now prepared to add the -\Q% reduction in umemployment Insurance benefit, and the other additionaleconomies,     &apos; making in ail  20 millions gross,to the programme which had already been approved.Some discussion took place as to the preciseposition regarding the Parliamentary situation, andon this point Hie Prime Minister reminded the Cabinetthat when he and the Chancellor of the Exchequer net the  Leaders of the Opposition Parties he had been assured in effect that they would be ready, by meansof a Parliamentary agreement,  to accept and supportthe proposals, provided that the financial interests were satisfied as to their sufficiency to meet theemergency,        He,  the Prime Minister, had made it clear that he interpreted the expression &quot;Parlia-mentary agreement&quot;  to mean that both Oppositionswould facilitate the passage of the GovernmentTsproposals, but that, if, for example,  the Oppositionscarried a motion to increase the reduction in&apos; . - &apos;Unemployment Insurance benefit from 10% to 20%, theGovernment would then be at liberty to regard the vote as one of &quot;no confidence&quot;.     He did not, however,consider that the Parliamentary situation presented;, S : \--.&quot;.:-V :V:&quot;.:.&apos;any real difficulty.At 7*45 P.m* the Cabinet adjourned to await the message from New York, and resumed at  .10 p.m., when the Prime Minister
read to the Cabinet a message -which had been addressed personally to him by Mr. Harrison.    Fora copy of this message see APPENDIX.    The Prime minister informed the Cabinet that he had ascertained fromthe Deputy Governor of the Bank of England that theyhad sounded in strict confidence certain important and influential financial interests in the city of London, all of which were parepared to support thescheme.    The Bank of England was also satisfiedas to the technical aspects of the financial proposals for the short term credit mentioned inthe message and thought that the amount suggested would suffice, provided that Parliament passed thelegislation necessary to secure budgetary equilibriumwithin a strictly limited time.With regard to the concluding paragraph ofthe message, the Prime Minister pointed out that,as the Opposition Parties had undertaken to supportthe Government&apos;s proposals, the conditions laiddown in that paragraph might be regarded asfulfilled.He most sincerely hoped that the cabinet would now accept the proposals as a whole.     If, however,the Cabinet were unable to accept them,  then it was clear that the loan which was essential to avert the crisis, would not be forthcoming and it was unthinkablethat the Government could remain in Office and preventsome other Administration being given the opportunitytheof deciding that/money should be found.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer expressed himself as generally satisfied from the technical pointof view with the proposals of the American financial interests as set out in Mr. Harrison&apos;s message, and thePrime Minister again stressed   his hope that, providedthat there was no Treasury objection to the &apos;Harrisonterms&apos;, the Cabinet would accept the full proposals,including the 10 per cent, cut in Unemployment insurance benefit.    It was not anticipated that there would be any difficulty in securing the co-operation of Frenchfinancial interests in the financial proposals.The Prime Minister informed, the Cabinet thata situation had now to be faced of a peculiarlydifficult character because, if the Labour Party wasnot prepared to join with the Conservative and LiberalParties in accepting the proposals as a whole, thecondition mentioned in Mr. Harrison&apos;s message, regarding a national agreement, would not be fulfilled.So far as he was concerned, he was strongly infavour of such acceptance while at the same time -making clear that the scheme       represented the extreme limit to which he was prepared to go.The country was suffering from lack of confidenceabroad.     There was, as yet, no panic at home, but thePrime Minister warned the Cabinet of the calamitousnature of the consequences which would immediately and inevitably follow from a financial panic and a flightfrom the pound.    No one could be blind to the verygreat political difficulties in which the giving effect to the proposals as a whole would involve theGovernment.     But, when the immediate crisis was over
and before Parliament met, it would be possible togive the Labour Party that full explanation of thecircumstances which had rendered it necessary for theGovernment to formulate such a drastic scheme,whichcould not be given at the moment.     The only alternative was a reduction not of 10 per ceht., but of at least 20 per cent., and he could not believethat the Labour party would reject the proposals when they knew the true facts of the position,    he was confident,indeed, that a majority of that Party would accept them.A scheme which inflicted reductions and burdens in almost every other direction, but made no appreciable cut in umemployment Insurance benefit, would alienate muchsupport and lose the Party their moral prestige which wasone of their greatest assets.    In conclusion, the PrimeMinister said that it must be admitted that the proposals as a whole, represented the negation of everything that the Labour Party stood for, and yet he was absolutely satisfied that it was necessary in the &quot;national interests, to implement them if the country was to besecured.     He then pointed out that, if on this question there were any important resignations, the government as a whole must resign.  ..&quot;Each member of the Cabinet then expressed his views on the question of the inclusion, or otherwise, inthe proposals, of the 10 per cent, reduction in umemployment Insurance benefit.
In the course of these expressions of view, indicationswere given that, while a majority of the cabinet favoured the inclusion in the economy proposals ofthe 10 per cent, reduction in unemployment insurance benefit,  the adoption of this as part and parcel ofthe scheme would involve the resignation ofcertain Ministers from the Government.In these circumstances the Prime minister informed the Cabinet that he proposed to acquaintHis Majesty at once  with  the situation which had arisen, and to advise him to hold a conference withMr. Baldwin, Sir H. Samuel and himself on thefollowing morning.      The Cabinet agreed to thisproposal, and also authorised the prime Ministerto inform His Majesty that all Cabinet ministers had placed their resignations in the Prime Minister&apos;shands.     The Prime Minister left the meeting ofthe Cabinet at 10.10 p.m.The Prime Minister returned from buckingham palace at about 10.IfO p.m.  and stated to the Cabinetthat he had informed His Majesty of the situation,namely that, while the Government had agreed thatthe Budget should be balanced,  they had been unableto reach agreement on proposals to deal effectively with the existing financial emergency, and accordinglythat it was impossible for them to continue in office as a united Cabinet..     He had then advisedHis Majesty that he should accord, an Audience toMr. Baldwin, Sir Herbert Samuel and himself on thefollowing morning, and His Majesty had been pleased to fix 10 a.m. as the time for this Audience.
t3 UThe Cabinet agreed  (i) That no announcement should beissued to the Press;(ii) That the Prime Minister should inform the Leaders of the opposition parties forthwith of the natureof the message which he hadreceived from Mr. Harrison;(iii) Toleave the question of the summoning of Parliament in thehands of the Prime Minister;(iv) That a further meeting of  theCabinet should be held- on Monday-next, August 24th, 1931, at no. 10, Downing Street, at 12 noon,but that no formal notice of thismeeting should be issued.
FUTUREARRANGEMENTSREGARDINGMINISTERIAL(RESPONSIBILITY.2.In the course of the discussion referredto in the previous conclusion the Prime Ministerreminded the Cabinet that it was the constitutional practice that, after resignation, each Ministercontinued to perform the purely formalfunctions of his office until the appointmentof his successor, but abstained from questionsof policy.      Ministers concerned would receivenotice as to the arrangements for the surrender ofthe Seals of Office.The Cabinet took note ofthe Prime Minister&apos;sstatement.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.22fth August, 1931.
A P P E K D I X.MESSAGE PRCL; MR. HARRISON.We are considering very carefully the tentative suggestion made by the Deputy Governor of the Bank: as to the barepossibility of the British Government desiring to arrangesome form of a joint French and American credit, but itis quite impossible to give any assurance to-day.      Pleasetell your friends in the event that they should desirefinancial co-operation we shall as always do our utmost tomeet their wishes.      If the suggestion were to take the shape of a public loan offering we are confident that untilParliament convenes an act and until we have had an opportunityto feel out our/community^could render no favourable opinionwhatsoever.      If the suggestion, however, were to take the formof a short-term Treasury operation that would be lessdifficult and if the British Government should desire us tocanvass amongst ourselves and our immediate friends such asuggestion, we would take up the matter vigorously tomorrow morning and be able to give you an answer by our closingtomorrow afternoon.Kindly let us know subsequent to the result ofthe Cabinet Meeting which you say will be held this eveningY/hether the Government wishes us to explore promptly this possibility.      The furthest we have gone to-day has been to discuss merely amongst ourselves the possibility of ashort credit in this market of $ ,100,000,000 to $150,000,000and we have as before indicated assumed that as a condition theFrench market will do an equivalent amount.      When we state ashort-term we have roughly in mind 90 days Treasury Billssubject to renewal for an inclusive period of one year.In the foregoing we have as always given you the precise trend of our thoughts.     Let us know promptly as
above indicated what the Government&apos;s desires are and within24 hours we shall be able to give you our final judgment.Are we right in assuming that the programme underconsideration will have the sincere approval and supportof the Bank of England and the City generally and thus goa long way towards restoring internal confidence inGreat Britain.Of course our ability to do anything depends onthe response of public opinion particularly in GreatBritain to the Government&apos;s announcement of the programme.
