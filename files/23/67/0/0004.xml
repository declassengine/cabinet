eduction andimitation oplaments .e, &quot;Disarmamenterenee .ePres idency^previous reference:cabinet 2231)    Oon-conclusion 5.)1.    The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet a message he had received from the Secretary of State^or Foreign Affairs, stating (as mentioned in thepublic Press) that he had. been asked to accept the presidency of the League of Nations Conference on disarmament, which was to open at Geneva onFebruary 2,  1932.    The Foreign Secretary had statedthat personally he was willing to accept,  subjectto the approval of the Cabinet.   The Prime Ministeronce madementioned that the appointment/was personal toMr Henderson and independent of his position as secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.While greatly appreciating and welcoming thehigh compliment paid, to the Secretary of State bythis offer, the Cabinet were unable to conceal fromthemselves that from the point of view of government business certain disadvantages were involved.   TheDisarmament Conference was expected to occupy many months, possibly more than a year.   The president would probably have to spend much time at Genevaboth at the Sessions of the Conference and in negotiations:    perhaps also during the preparatoryperiod.   A great deal of his time would be required,.The Secretary of State could ill be spared., either from his own Department or from the work of theCabinet.    It might also be necessary to appoint asecond Minister to lead the United Kingdom Delega-tion at the Conference, since the President wouldbe much occupied with his  own duties of a neutraland impartial character.    It was generally agreedt-hat the Conference was of such importance that the delegation could. not be led by anyone except amember of the Cabinet.   The frequent absence of a
second Minister would throw further strain on theother members of the Cabinet .The Cabinet agreed  That the Prime Minister should inform the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs that theCabinet, in spite of certain difficulties, was willing toleave the final decision to himself.
URALHOUSINGpreviousReference:Cabinet 16(31),  Con-clusiona.3..The Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theMinister of Health (CP.-1C4 (31)  and CP.-127 (31))reporting the results of negotiations between theLord Privy Seal and Sir Tudor Walters, on behalfof the liberal Party, on the subject of Rural Housing.As a result of these negotiations  Sir Tudor 7/altershad abandoned his original rather elaborate proposals but was anxious that some plan should be adoptedwhich, while leavinp Local Authorities responsiblefor the provision of houses, would enable additional assistance to be given to those Authorities who areunable, by reason of their financial position, tomeet the housing needs of the area.   While the minister was strenuously opposed to any departure from thepolicy&quot;laid down in the Housing Act of 1930, he didnot object to further provision being made fornecessitous areas, and submitted the outline of a plan (appended to CP,-127 (31)) which, while leaving the principles of the Housing Act of 19 30 intact,would secure the agreement of the Liberal Party.It was essential that if the scheme was adoptedno form of announcement of it should be made until after the receipt and examination of certain returnsasked for from the County Councils on the housing conditions in their rural areas and the financialassistance they are prepared to give to Rural district councils in addition to the statutory County contri-but ion of  1 per house for 40 years in respect ofhouses occupied by agricultural workers.   The Ministerof Health warned his colleagues that the applicationof the scheme to urban areas  (which politically couldnot be avoided if applied to rural areas) was verydifficult and might be prejudicial to housing generally.
The detailed scheme provided for the setting, up ofQ Ja Committee, which might he compared to theUnemployment Grants Committee, to decide on thecases in which grants should be given.    It was estimated that the aggregate capital value of the grants required to carry out the scheme   tiould notexceed  2,000,000 for Great Britain.   The annualcharge falling on the Exchequer would be approximately 112,000 for 40 years, in addition to the charge inrespect of the ordinary housing grant payable underthe Acts of 1934 and 1930.    In the first year theadditional Exchequer charge would be less than halfof the full liability.   Adaptations would be requiredin the scheme to make it applicable to Scotland.The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attentionto the fact that the proposal in the Memorandum hadnot been discussed with the Treasury, as laid downin Cabinet Regulations, before being submitted tothe Cabinet.After considerable discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the preparation of ascheme on the lines proposed bythe Minister of Health, on theunderstanding that expenditure was to be concentrated on rural housing:(b) That the Minister of Health should prepare a detailed scheme in theform of a Memorandum setting forth the heads of the proposed Bill.
jig TARIFFrUCB.3gotiationsPrevi ousReferences:Cabinet 1931), Con-conclusion 1,and Cabineti0 (SO), Con-elusion 2.)3.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe President of the Board of Trade &apos; CP.-124 (31))giving particulars of proposals recently made to seven European countries with a view to securing a general lowering of Customs tariffs, as well as of their replies (which for the most part wereunsatisfactory and almost entirely lacking inprecision) and counter proposals .-   The proposal ofthe President of the Board of Trade was that theBelgian, Polish^, German and French governments should be informed that their counter proposals had received preliminary consideration, and thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government would find it difficult toenter into any undertaking to maintain at theirpresent level any existing duties in force in theUnited Kingdom, and still more difficult to reducethem.    Should the principal countries approached,however,, be ready to reduce substantially the dutiesnow levied on goods of interest to the UnitedKingdom,  of which lists had been furnished, HisMajesty&apos;s Government would, for their part, beprepared to contemplate the possibility of giving a pledge that for a period to be determined no freshprotective duties should be imposed on goods atpresent free of Customs duty, and, further, that existing temporary Safeguarding Duties would notbe renewed on expiration of the period for whichthey had been imposed,   mhe four Governments wouldbe asked, having regard to the above declaration,to explain as fully as possible the extent to whichthey would be prepared to meet the desiderata ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government, and, in particular, tostate on whioh articles in the lists submitted tothem,  in rettirn for the above assurances, they would
be willing to reduce existing duties by 25 per cent.The proposals contained slight modifications inrespect of certain of the Governments to be approached, adjusted to their several replies.mhe above proposals were discussed from various points of view, including the effect of theirannouncement on the Ottawa Conference.After considerable discussion the Cabinet agreed -(a) That in the Despatches to thevarious Governments the Presidentof the Board of Trade should explain that the object of theoriginal proposal of HisMajestyTs Government had been to reduce tariff walls, whichare generally admitted to be an obstacle to trade recovery inEurope.   The counter proposalsof the Government to whom eachletter was addressed should thenbe summarised, and they should beasked whether they considered thattheir respective proposals made anyserious contribution towards thisobject.    Each country should beasked whether,  in view of the above and with the knowledge of what theBritish policy towards tariffs is,it could re-consider its proposals:(b) That the President of the Board ofTrade should have authority toproceed with his proposals on theabove lines ,
I ?AS SPORESI THE AMERICAN&quot;ISA PFE.[The TravellAssoc iatlon.l( previous references :Cabinet 22I (21), Con-1 elusion 14.1 and Cabinet10 (?0), Con.elusion Q .)5o fei40 The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum, bythe Lord Privy Seal (CP.-129 (31)) on the questionof the American visa fee,  arising out of his announce-ment in the Debate on the Vote of Censure on April16th. that the Government were considering thepossibility of o&quot;ore active steps to attract visitorsfrom overseas to this country.   He stated that lord derby and the Travel Association of Great britain are of opinion that the most important single stepwithin the sphere of possible Government action inthe immediate future would be the abolition or reduction of the fee of 10 dollars charged toAmericans for a visa to visit this country.Particulars were given 0&quot;^ the statistics of Americanvisitors  to various countries and o^ the results which had followed the reduction of a visa fee.It. was stated, that Great Britain is the only country of any importance in Europe which maintains thepresent high charge.    From the point of view, ofunemployment it was stated that the hotel, restaurantand club services alone already employ some 350,000persons;    that is to say, more than are employeddirectly by the iron and steel industry.    The Memo-randum also stated that arrangements had been madefor the substitution of the words &quot;Foreign Visitor&quot;for the offensive term &quot;Alien&quot; in posters andleaflets in use by immigration staffs, etc., andthat the general practice was not to submit visitors to medical examination.    The Lord Privy Sealproposed to discuss with the Home Secretary the advisability of making these facts more widely known overseas.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled thatthe question of the American visa fee had been beforethe Cabinet as recently as February 12, 1930 (cabinet if (30), Conclusion 9), -when it had been decidedthat no action should be taken to abolish the visaor to reduce the fee, and that, as recorded in theConclusion, this decision had been taken solely for financial reasons.    Since that date the financial situation had in no way improved.   He was thereforeopposed to any alteration in the previous decision.He reminded the Cabinet that foreign Governmentsimposed other taxes on tourists that in the aggregatewere no less onerous than the British visa fee:for example, the French tax on landing from america and re-embarkation:    tourist taxes;   hotelbill taxes : and local taxes of various kinds .The Cabinet agreed  That the,subject should be brought up again.
5. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies  (CP,-128( 31)) reporting the position now developing as tothe Government&apos;s conclusions on Closer Union in east Africa in the Joint Committee to which theywere submitted (Cmd,3574) .    It had become evidentthat the Joint Committee would not report in favourof these conclusions and might possibly confineitself to reco-mending no change at present..Various new factors which had arisen since thepublication of the conclusions were mentioned, theroost Important of which is the severe economicslump into which all three territories,  andespecially Kenya, have suddenly fallen, and as theresult of which proposals to appoint a HighCommissioner with a staff and expenses costing about 50,000 a ye^r was now objected to by practicallyevery witness from East Africa.    This objection was strengthened by the unanimity of the nativewitnesses against closer union.   Yet anotherdifficulty was the probable objections of theGerman Government to the inclusion of the mandated territory of Tanganyika in any form of closer union.In the circumstances the Secretary of State advised that it would be useless to press the Joint Committeeto  endorse the conclusions.    If the Joint committee reported against- them he considered it would not be politically practicable for the Government toenforce them on the territories concerned.   He&quot; suggested that for some time to come the government must be content with such reforms as could be intro-duced gradually and quietly without Constitutionalinnovation.   A change of Governors might enable the governors Conference to secure all necessary common
action,  especially if the Conference met alternatelyin- each o^ the three territories, under the Presi-dency of the Governor of the territory to be visited.This should serve to secure any necessary uniformity in laws and even in Customs Duties.   With regard toNative affairs the new Governor of Kenya might be trusted to do all that was possible to give effectto the White Paper.    It was hoped that Indians would now participate in the elections now in progress and resume their seats on the Legislative Council.For railways and roads he contemplated the specialengagement of a transport expert to advise on railwayextension, co-ordination of roads and lake steamers,and a general system o^ railway rates, reporting tothe Secretary of State after consultation with the governors and two general railway managers, as wellas others concerned.   Any actual amalgamation ofthe two railway systems could await their- physicalconnection, which cannot long be delayed. A commonRailway Board might become essential in the future,b-ut this could wait until the amalgamation takespl-ac e .The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Cabinet that he had felt it necessary to warnthem as to the position, since it devolved upon himto defend the Govei^nmentrs policy at the JointCommittee, and he was now convinced that the latterbody would not accept it.The Secretary of State for India reminded theCabinet that the co-operation of the Indians in theelections was a result of the policy announced inthe White Paper on the Indian Question (Cmd.3574(F)).He hoped there was no question of modifying that policy.
In taking note of the report of the Secretaryof State for the Colonies the Cabinet took no decision to alter their policy.11-

The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet that,as decided at the meeting referred to in the margin,he had seen the Members of Parliament who had putdown an amendment to the Representation of thePeople Bill in favour of re-instatement of theclause abolishing University representation,  andhad explained to then the difficult situation thattheir amendment would create for the Government.He had now received an intimation that the amendmentv/ould not be moved.In reply to a question the Home Secretaryexplained that a member of a University would onlybe allowed to exercise one vote.In taking note of the above,  theCabinet left any further steps inthe matter to the Home Secretary.-1 5-

Itwas suggested that the precedents were notfavourable to this course, and that it might benecessary for him to publish the official Reportin the form of an answer to an unstarred question,to which allusion could be made in tho shorteranswer.The matter was left to the discretion of the First Lord of the admiralty to arrango, after enquiry.

The Prime Minister informed the Cabinetthat he had been asked,  on behalf of the Cabinet,to approve the instructions to the UnitedKingdom Delegates at the forthcoming meeting ofthe International Labour Organisation.      Theusual weekly meeting of the Cabinet would not take place during the   Y/whitsun recess,  and thiswas why he had been asked to approve the matter on behalf of the Cabinet,      lie felt some doubt,however, as ti whether the Ministers concerned had seen the draft Instructions,  some of whichwere of a somewhat hesitating and non-committalcharacter.The Cabinet were informed that the usualprocedure was for officials of the Departmentsconcerned to hold a preliminary meeting todiscuss the questions to come before the Intern-national Labour Organisation, and a second meeting after each official had been able to consult his own Minister.      There appeared tobe some doubt, however, as to whether all theMinisters had seen the instructions.The Cabinet agreed  That the Ministers concerned should examine the instructions and inform the Prime Ministerwhethei  they met with theirrespective approval, and thata corresponding procedure shouldbe adopted in all similar cases ,
16.    The Cabinet had a short discussion onthe question as to whether the Guillotine      -Resolution,  to be moved on Thursday,  June -^th,should be handed in before or after Whitsuntide.The objection to the former course wasthat it might form an inconvenient precedentto circulate it so far in advance.      It was further pointed out that the Opposition would have no ground for serious grievance if the resolution was handed in on Tuesday, June fp&amp;a..      The applica-tion of the Guillotine was fully justified bythe number of amendments (6o)  that had been handed in to the first few clauses of the Finance Bill..On the whole, however,  the cabinet felt that as a somewhat un/sual precedure wasbeing adopted in applying the Guillotine to aFinance Bill,  the fairer course would be togive as full notice as possible.It was agreedThat the Prime Minister should informthe House of Commons that theGuillotine Resolution would be handed in before Whitsuntide.
