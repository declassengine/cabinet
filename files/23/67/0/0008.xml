THE finance bill.Land TaxrovisionsClause 20.(previous reference:Cabinet 32(31), Con-clusion 1.)%(3.) 3.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that onthe previous evening he had found, it necessary to summon at the shortest notice all members of theCabinet -who were within reach.   About eighteenmembers of the Cabinet had been present at that meeting of Ministers, as the result of which hehad summoned an Emergency Meeting of the cabinet this morning to take decisions on the latest version of the Liberal amendment to Clause 20 of the LandTaxes part of the Finance Bill (Appendix).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that,following the meeting on the previous evening anda letter he had received that morning from thePrime Minister, he felt he could, no longer persist-in his refusal to fall in with the views of hiscolleagues in regard to the Liberal amendment.The wording of the amendment, however, would haveto be considered, before the Bill was finally passed.In coming to this conclusion he had been impressed by the fact that in moving this amendment the Liberalhad. departed from the principle of their oppositionto double taxation.    A tax would be levied on allland assessed, apart from the announced exemptions ..The yield of the tax,  it was true, would be much less than originally contemplated, but at thepresent stage he did not attach great importanceto this, provided his main principle was established.In the course of the discussion it was pointedout that the general conception of the liberalamendment was based on a proposal by the Government,although the figures had been somewhat reduced.The Cabinet were informed that there was consid-erable doubt as to whether the Liberal motion would,be admissible, according to the Rules of Procedure,
as an amendment to Clarise 20, and the procedure was discussed from two points of view according as the amendment was or was not allowed.In the course of the discussion the Chancellorof the Exchequer mentioned that he was consideringwithdrawing Clause 19 with a view to introducingits content as a new Clause at the end of theCommittee Stage.    In this event Clause 20 would come up for discussion immediately on the resumptionof the Committee Stage of the Bill that afternoon..The Cabinet agreed  -(a) That if the Liberal Amendment was allowed to stand the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer should be authorisedto accept it in substance, but should make it clear that thephraseology would have to beconsidered before the finalpassage of the Bill:(b) Tliat if the Amendment was not inorder the Chancellor of the exchequer should intimate that the Governmentwould introduce a new Clause basedon it.2., &apos;*hitehell Gardens , S ,T. 1,June 16, 19 31.
