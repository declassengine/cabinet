1.   The Cabinet eent the following messageHis Majesty the Zing on the occasion of hisbirthday:-&quot;The King1^ Servants meeting in Cabinet this morning desirewith their humble dirty &quot;to offerYour Majesty their loyal con-gratulations on the occasion of Your Majesty&apos;s birthday&quot;.
2. The Cabinet bad before them a Note circulatedshortly before the Meeting by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs on the subject of the proposedAustro-German Customs Union (CP.-140 (31)).   TheSecretary of State had been deeply impressed by theimportance which all the Governments of Centralquest ion,Europe attach to the matter. This / as they had made plain, was by far the most important political issue which had arisen in Europe since the &apos;&quot;&quot;7ar.   Afterexplaininp the extreme gravity of this question the Secretary of State in his Memorandum reportedthat in the discussions of the European Committeethe Austro-German Union had become merged with thatof the economic crisis, and that there had been general agreement that the solution for both must befound during the next few months .    Otherwise therewas general realisation in Central Europe that thedanger of social disturbance and even civil war inGermany and other countries might become acute.The European Corn-frit tee had advised the setting upof three Technical Committees, - Agricultural,Financial and Economic.    The Economic Committee wasto consist of &quot;highly qualified economists ofgeneral competence&quot;, and it was desired that it shouldbe composed of independent persons who, while in contact with their Governments, should be free torecommend whatever measures they deem appropriate to deal with the present distress.   After consultationwith the Treasury and the President of the Board ofTrade, the Secretary of State proposed that he shouldbe authorised to invite Sir Walter Layton to sit onthis Committee as the nominee of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment .
The Cabinet authorised theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs to invite Sir WalterLayton to sit on the proposedEconomic Committee as the nomineeof Fis Majesty&apos;s Government.
CHINA. 3.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byExtraterritori- the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-138ality in.(31)) reporting the position of the negotiations(previous with the Chinese Government for the abolition ofReference:Cabinet 27 extraterritoriality, which had now reached a crucial(31), Con-elusion 1.) point.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said3i(y))- that the decision which now had to be taken was oneof the first importance.    It involved the immediaterendition of the British Concessions at Hankow andCanton, and the surrender of important extraterrito -rial rights of British subjects at Shanghai afterten years, and at Tientsin after five years.   Therewould certainly be an important Parliamentary debate on the subject.    In view of the urgency of thequestion he could not agree to postpone a decisionfor as long as a week, as this might lead to a breakdown in the negotiations, but he doubted whetherthe Cabinet ought to take a decision in the absenceof the Prime Minister.The Chancellor o^ the Exchequer reminded theCabinet that the Prime Minister had been most anxious to confine the business at the Meeting ofthe Cabinet arranged for the following day exclusive-ly to Agricultural Policy and the kindred questions on the Agenda Paper.In view, however, of the great urgency and importance of the question of the Treaty with China,the Cabinet agreed  That the Prime Minister should beasked to allow the question of the china Treaty to be placed first onthe Agenda Paper of the Cabinet-Meeting on the following day.
PASSPORTS.The AmericanVisa Pee.The TravelAssoc iation.(previous reference:Cabinet 29(31), Con-clusion 4.)-5-4. The Cabinet again had before them theMemorandum by the Lord Privy Seal (CP.129 (31))on the question of the American Visa Pee, whichwas summarised in the Minute referred to in the margin.The Secretary explained that this question had been placed on the Agenda Paper through a misunderstanding, and as no member of the Cabinetdesired to raise it at the moment the subject wasnot discussed.
itsTHE coal situation.(previous reference:Cabinet 29(31),  Con-clusion 6.)Ft.1^)9.5. Tbe President of the Board of Trade said thathe would have nothing to report on the Coal negotia-tions until after the meetings arranged for Fridaynext, June 5th.The subject was continued on theAgenda Paper .
the IRON AND*steel TRADE.Re-organisa-tion of.(previous reference:Cabinet 29(31),  Oon-clusion 7 .)6. The President of the Board of Trade saidthat the question of the re-organisation of theIron and Steel Industry was awaiting the conversa-tions whioh the Prime Minister was to have with theGovernor of the Bank of .England, and in the meanwhilethere was nothing to report.The subject was continued onthe Agenda Paper .
rnTTE COTTONINDUSTRY.jjl previous reference:Cabinet 15(31), Con-elusion 7.)7 .The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumby the Home Secretary and the President of theBoard of Trade (C.P.-136 (31)) informing the cabinet as to the latest developments towards the re-organiss.-tion of the Cotton Industry.   The Joint Committeeof the Cotton Trade Organisations had passed a seriesof Resolutions.   Resolution No. 1 brought out thata root cause of the industry&apos;s difficulties is theexistence o&quot;^ a surplus of productive capacity forthe use of which there is no prospective demand.Resolution 2 proposed the appointment of an invest!--gator with statutory powers of enquiry and with thedut-y of aecurinp info&quot; mat ion for the use of theExecutive Committee in preparing a scheme for maintaining a closer relation between capacity and demand..    Resolution No .4, added subsequently,proposed, in the first instance, to collect this information voluntarily.    Resolution No.3 dealtwith various measures which should accompany the adjustment of productive capacity, and calls forno comment at the present stage.   Attached to theMemorandum was a draft letter to the Chairman ofthe Joint Committee noting with satisfaction the steps being taken to find a solution to the diffi-culties now confronting the Cotton Industry, andagreeing with the proposal that the informationnecess?ry to the formulation of a scheme for maintaining capacity in closer relation to demandshould,  if possible, be collected on a voluntary basis without resort to the statutory powerscontemplated in Resolution No.2.
In amplification of the Memorandum the Presidentof the Board of Trade reported that the representa-tives of the industry were not delaying matterswhile the information was being obtained, but were already working out a plan for the closing ofredundant units.The Minister of Labour warned the Cabinet ofthe immediate effect  that the closing down of millswould have on unemployment in Lancashire.While recognising that, in view of the serious position in Lancashire,  it was urgent to press on with the re-organisation of the Cotton Industry as rapidly as possible, the Cabinet accepted the views&apos;   .    :      &apos; :     . .......... ,     ....    ... .   . . ;     .......   ...   ... ..........,of the Home Secretary and the President of the Boardof Trade as set forth in C.P.-136 (31)),and summarise&apos;1above, and approved the draft of a letter to theChairman of the Joint Committee attached in Annex IIto that Memorandum.
8 . The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Transport  &apos;C.P.-131 (31)) reporting the result of the enquiry by an Advisory Committeeappointed by the London County Council to prepare an agreed scheme for a new road bridge and approa-cheat Charing Cross .    The Committee had not reachedcomplete agreement.   Nine of its sixteen members^however, had agreed to recommend Scheme No ..6 outof nine schemes to which detailed consideration hadbeen given.   This scheme embodies all the essentialprinciples of the scheme rejected by the SelectCommittee of the House of Commons, though differingfrom that scheme in certain respects, the mostimportant of which relates&quot; to the approach on theLambeth side..On the merits of the case the Minister ofTransport considered that the Government should adhere to the opinion previously expressed, thatthe provision of an additional bridge over the thames at Charing Cross is a matter of urgency,and that none of the schemes submitted which involved the retention of Charing Cro.ss Station onits present site presents a satisfactory solution to the problem.    It was also clear that if thescheme recommended by the- majority of the Committeewas to proceed, it would be necessary to give anundertaking that a contribution of 75 per cent. ofthe cost of its promotion and execution would bemade from the Road Fund.    For the moment he proposed to reply to a letter from the LondonCounty Council on the subject to the effect that before arriving at any decision as to renewingtheir offer of a 75 per cent, grant towards a schemesuch as that recommended by the Committee, theGovernment would desire to be informed whether,
-upon examination by the Committee, the Councilapproved it and would, in the event of a grantbeing available, be prepared to proceed with it.Ee suggested to add that the Government adheresto the view that no scheme would be satisfactorywhich did not provide for the removal of theexisting railway bridge.The Cabinet were reminded that the general financial position had deteriorated very materiallysince the o-&quot;fer of a 75 per cent, grant from theRoad Fund had been made towards the Charing CrossBridge.    In particular,  the Road Fund was nowthreatened with a serious deficit during the next five years .    Such grants were normally only givenin cases where unemployment would be relieved,  andany decision to renew the grant now could not produce any material effect on the unemploymentposition for two or three years.   The new scheme,it was pointed out, had. only been adopted by an arrow majority, and a good deal of doubt existed &apos;as to whether it would be approved ;tr^Par 1 lament.In the circumstances the Cabinet agreed * That the Minister of Transport-should intimate to the LondonCounty Council that the Govern-ment would not express any viewson the subject until the council had itself reached a conclusionand adopted a scheme.
THF ROAD 9 . The Cabinet had before them a MemorandumTRAFFICACT, 1930. by the Minister of Transport  (CP.-132 (31)) onthe subject of Sub-section 3 of Section 61 of theThe conveyance of Passengers     Road Traffic Act, the provisions of -which bring in Lorries.within the definition of &quot;contract carriage&quot;    any(Previous vehicle -which is used for carrying eight or moreReference:Cabinet 26 passengers (except workpeople conveyed in the(31), Con-elusion 10.)     course of or to or from their employment) evenfo though no change is made for their conveyance.3q- $(&apos;()^, This rules out the use of lorries for such purposes has the conveyance of cricket and football teams,school treats, workpeople&apos;s outings, etc., as it isimpossible for vehicles of the lorry type to complywith the constructional conditions (imposed by regulation) which are necessary for them to obtainlicences as public service vehicles .   After setting forth in detail the representations which had beenmade to him as to the hardships of these provisions and the objections to any alteration in the law,the Minister asked his colleagues to decide whether(i) to leave the position as it isunder the provisions of the Act:or(ii) to give facilities for legislationamending or repealing sub-section 3of Section 61 of the Road traffic act.On merits he regarded the law as it stands as right.The question was really one of political expediency.The Cabinet decided in principlethat the use without charge oflorries for purposes of work-people&apos;^ outings, etc., as. indicated above,  ought not tobe illegal, and. left it to the    -Minister of Transport to decide as to the method by which effect could best be given to thisdecision.
CO-ordination and public ownership CPTRANSPORT .fPr previous reference:Cabinet 60(SO),  Con-cliision 2.)F.R.10 .The Cabinet took note of a record of the present-oeeedings of a Deputation from the Joint Committeeof the three Railway Trade Unions received by thePrime Minister at the House of Commons on Tuesday,May 19, 19 31, on the subject of the Co-ordination and Public Ownership of Transport (CP.-137 (31)).
sg^fTNG, GAMING0D LOTTERIES .evi ousef erence cabinet 72(50), Con-elusion 10.)ft.11. The Home Secretary invited the attentionof the Cabinet to the present position in regard toSweepstakes.    The Home Office were doing their utmost to carry out the law, but were encounteringgreat difficulties.   Many Courts were treatingbreaches of the law as a trivial offence, and insome cases the observations of the Magistratesamounted to a condonation.   There was reason tobelieve that in the autumn lotteries would be promoted in Dublin on an even larger scale thanthose recently organised.   The whole subject was becoming one of increasing public and political interest and importance, and he thought that  in a preliminary way the Cabinet might like to ventilatethe question.    He recalled that the Government had offered -an Inquiry if there was any general demand.Up to now this had not been the case.A short discussion of a preliminary and tentativecharacter took place.    It was suggested that thepresent, infringements of the law could not be allowedto continue much longer.    Sooner or later theGovernment would be forced to undertake an Inquiry .varying opinions were expressed as to whether an inquiry should be initiated at once, whether itmight not be better to wait until pressure becamestronger, or whether even some drastic action should not be considered in order to enforce the law.The Home Secretary undertook, in due course, to circulate a Memorandum in order that the question might be discussed on the basis of full information and in the presence of the Prime Minister,itehali Gardens,  S.W.1, .  .  .June 3, 1931.
