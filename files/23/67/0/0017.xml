jgNDITURE,Iport of the&apos;j CommitteeRationalpenditure.lliticalInferences,previous reference-:Cabinet 4-i(51), Con-elusion 1.7.)..F.R.jConference withleaders of the[OppositioniParties.1.    In pursuance of the Conclusion referredto in the margin,  the Cabinet met to hear the&quot;.,,,reports on the meetings which had taken placeearlier in the day, including the meeting between certain Cabinet Ministers and the Leadersof the Opposition Parties.     At the outset a communication from the General Council of theTrade Union Congress was read intimating that theCouncil had appointed a Committee to place theviews of the Council before the Cabinet.It was agreed  That the Cabinet Committee on theReport of the Committee on national expenditure should meet the Committeeof the General Council that same evening at 9.JO P.m., and should report the views of the Council tothe Cabinet at the meeting at 10.0 a.m.on Friday, August 21st, 1931.The Cabinet were informed by the Chancellorof the Exchequer that the Prime Minister and himself had that morning met Mr. neville chamberlain, Sir S. Hoare, Sir H. Samuel and SirDonald Maclean and had outlined the economyproposals.     The meeting had been cordial, but theConservative Leaders had expressed doubts as to the feasibility of securing the contemplated cutsin the estimates of the Fighting Services andhad intimated quite definitely that in their view the proposed savings on unemployment insurancewould fail to satisfy expectations, and that,unless substantial^ larger economies on this service were realised, the whole scheme wouldbe rendered ineffective.      No reference hadbeen made by the Conservative Leaders to thequestion of a Revenue Tariff.     As regards the
revenue proposals all the Opposition Leadershad made it clear that they could not possibly contemplate the imposition of newtaxation of the order of  100 million, andhad urged the need for securing a much largeraggregate economy figure, if public confidencewas to be restored.The Prime Minister added that he had seen Mr. Neville Chamberlain again later inthe day.     Mr. Chamberlain had expressed theopinion that, in view of the size of the prospective deficit, the object in view would not be attained unless economies of theorder of approximately  100 million in theaggregate were secured and in this connection he (lir. Chamberlain) had strongly advocatedmore drastic action as regards the unemploymentinsurance proposals.The President of the Board of Tradestated that subsequently he had seenSir EL, Samuel who was in a position toindicate the views of Mr. Lloyd George.     the liberals also favoured more drastic actionIn regard to. unemployment insurance, and, iniparticular, urged reduction of benefits andother changes designed to secure substantial savings on that service.     They suggested thetemporary suspension of the Sinking Fund andwere most strongly opposed to a Revenue Tariffanyin/shape or form.      In their view the gapshould be bridged by raising indirect taxationto the highest possible point.
conference withtjie Consulta-tive Committee.Conference withthe Joint Meetingof the Trade UnionCongress general council and theNational executive of the Labour Party.The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs reported that at the meeting with the consultative Committee that Committee had adopted a very reasonable attitude and had,in effect, adjourned until the eve of thereassembling of Parliament.At the conference with the general council of the Trade Union Congress and theNational Executive statements had been madeby the Prime Minister and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer.      The National Executive had  .agreed to leave the whole question with theGovernment,     The views of the General council would be submitted to the Cabinet committee at 9*3?0 p.mf that evening.The Cabinet took note ofthese reports.
PAYMENTsitionaljfit.S. The Cabinet had before them the Report t-(Paper CP. 204 (51)) of the Committee appointed attheir previous meeting to devise a scheme which inits financial results would relieve the Treasury ofevious Ref-aCe:    Cabinet(gl) Conclusion   the  20 millions for Transitional Benefit.L(2Xiii)).The Cabinet Committee, after giving theirreasons for thinking that the proposal for a&apos;premium&apos;  to be paid by unemployed workers was impracticable, had considered that the above mentioned figure of  20 millions must be increased toa figure of  28^ millions and had reported asfollows:-&quot;(2) That the 26 weeks rule should be supplement-ed by requiring a qualifying period ofemployment after a claimant has received26 weeks ordinary benefit and before he is entitled to further ordinary benefit.(3) That a needs test&quot;be applied by theMinistry of Labour through such localmachinery as may be devised to persons not entitled to ordinary benefit.    The Ministerof Health estimated that this would produce not more than  5m. per year.(4) If the Cabinet were to approve the paymentof an additional contribution of 2d. by .insured persons in work (making a total of1/-) towards the cost of this scheme, thiswill yield  4m.(5) If all the foregoing steps are adopted,there will still remain to be found, outof the sum of  28m. mentioned above, a sumof upwards of  19-1- millions.&quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded the Cabinet that the Committee had been appointed to save  20,000,000 for the Exchequer on transitional benefit but had only been able to *fed a further 4m. by raising the workers&apos; contributions by anadditional 2d.In the result the present position asregards Unemployment Insurance was that additionalincome had been found (by increasing contributions)to the extent of /
9?1ei Aj L 14 millions and economies had been proposed tothe extent of  8 millions, of which  3 millions was in the recent Act.    Tris amounted in all to 22 millions.      On an estimated expenditure in1932 of  143 millions on this Service, the recentefforts of the Government to secure savings had only resulted in reducing this great item of ex-penditure by about 5 per cent, or by about 5 percent, if the  3 millions of the recent A.ctwas disregarded.The situation to-day was that UnemploymentInsurance economies were put at  22 millions andother economies at  30 millions, or  52 millions in all, leaving a gap to be filled by taxation of 118 millions.    This figure would of course, haveto be increased if, as seemed certain, it was found impossible to realise the  50 millions fromeconomies other than Unemployment Insurance.    Inthis connection the Cabinet were reminded that thevalue of Unemployment benefit to-day was over 30per cent, higher than the 1924 value, and that thatvalue had been accepted as adequate by the thenLabour Government at a time when the Budgets were showing handsome surpluses.    The present position,with its prospective enormous deficit and vastincrease of taxation, was contrasted with theposition in 1924 and emphasis was laid on thefact that while the wage earner was receiving the same value as in 1924,
0 9 9t? ki 4ithe real value of -unemployment &quot;benefit had risen by over 30 per cent.    In conclusion theChancellor of the Exchequer stressed the vitalimportance of effecting a real   and not merely a paper equilibrium.After a brief discussion, in the courseof which it was urged that some economy might besecured either by adoption of the Tpremium&apos; proposalor by insisting on a percentage cut (of say 5 percent) on the estimated benefit expenditure in 1932,the burden to be borne by all recipients of benefit,the Cabinet agreed -To defer until the following day their decision on the question whether any,and if so what, further unemploymentinsurance economies should be effected.
