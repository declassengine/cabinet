IRISH FREE 1. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bySTATE.  the Secretary of State for Dominion AffairsAppeals to thejudicial Com-   (CP.-ISO (51)) calling attention to a difficulttnittee of the privy Council, situation which has arisen in connection with thequestion of Appeals from the Irish Free State to(previous references:     the Judicial Committee.Cabinet 8(26), Con- After summarising the earlier history of theclus ion 16):Cabinet 51       question the Memorandum recalled the difficulties(SO)., Con-clusion 1.)     that had arisen at the Imperial Conference, 1930,p ^ QC(^jlf-- where the United Kingdom representatives had refusedto admit that the Irish Free State had any constitu-tional right to abolish the right of granting specialleave to appeal without the concurrence of HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and ofthe United Kingdom Parliament, which they had indicated was not likely to be given.   They had offered to refer the point to the new CommonwealthTribunal or to any other acceptable form of arbi-tration.   The Irish Free State representatives had rejected arbitration and had indicated the probability of their taking unilateral action.Subsequent informal discussions, had revealed thatthe Irish Free State Government proposed to introduce into their Parliament a Bill to secure discontinuance of appeals, and that in their opinion such legisla-tion was not likely to be opposed by the representa-tives of the South of Ireland Unionists.    It was felt that if this view proved to be correct, thesituation would be changed and a way might be open for an agreed settlement.    Conversations and communi-cations had followed, in the course of which theLegal Adviser to the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs, upon the basis that an agreement on the
subject of the Judicial Committee might be possiblehad put forward tentatively a clause on the following-lines:-&quot;It is hereby agreed that articles2 and 3 of the Articles of agreement for a Treaty between Great Britainand Ireland, dated the 6th day ofDecember, 1921, are to be construedso that, in the references thereinto the position of the Irish FreeState in relation to the positionof the Dominion of Canada,  theposition of the Dominion of Canadameans the position of that Dominionexisting from time to time.&quot;The Irish Free State had refused this proposal.After further communications with the Irish Free: :       &quot;r .y::;:yV&apos;;: -v5&apos;&apos; :minister::      y fvy&apos;y.: yj&apos;1.;&apos; y;K&apos;   &apos;y? &apos;y*v:yT^       -ys-yy   y&apos;-     &apos; y/! sy&apos;y&apos;State the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs reported that there was now no prospect of asatisfactory agreement on the subject.   The Ministerfor External Affairs in the Irish Free State Govern-ment had indicated their intention to proceed at once...... . .with unilateral action for the abolition of Appeals.In the circumstances the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs suggested to send a communication to the Irish Free State Government, the text ofwhich is given in full in paragraph 24 of G.P.-120(31), and the last paragraph of which is as follows:-&quot;Therefore, apart from any questionwhether legislation of the kind involved would be valid, or what would be itslegal effect, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom could not regardseparate action by His MajestyTs Govern-roent in the Irish Free State designedto bring about the abolition of the appeal, if taken without their assent,as compatible with the obligationsassumed by the Irish signatories tothe 1 Articles of Agreement for a Treaty&apos;of 1921.&quot;The discussion disclosed that the Cabinet did not stand for the maintenance of static relations betweenthe Irish Free State and the United Kingdom, but thatthe real difficulty was that the Irish Free State
insisted on doing on their own responsibility an action which ought   not to bo done except- by agreement.The Cabinet were reminded, however, that the IrishFree State Government had argued that they had the .right to abolish the appeal.After the Attorney-General had explained thelegal position, the Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the general policy setforth in the Memorandum by theSecretary of State for DominionAffairs  (CP.-120 (31)) and summarised above:(b) To leave discretion to the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs,  inconsultation with the Prime Minister,as to the steps to be taken to giveeffect to that policy:(c) That the Prime Minister and theSecretary of. State for DominionAffairs should, at the earliestpossible opportunity, inform theleaders of the two opposition parties in the House of commons of the present position.
cabinet procedure.arrangements in the Absenceof certain ministers .(previous reference:Cabinet 27(31),, Con-elusion 12.)S. The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that during the absence of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs at Geneva he had taken over responsibility for the direction of the ForeignOffice.    Owing to the indisposition of the Chancellorof the Exchequer, which had just been reported tohim, he might also find it necessary to act in somematters for him also.
3. The Prime Minister made a report to theCabinet on the present state of parliamentary business .This had. to be regulated by three dates, whichwere fixed by extraneous circumstances independent of the action of Parliament.First, Friday, July 3rd, by which date theFinance Bill must leave the House of Commons inorder to allow a month for its consideration bythe House of Lords, thus giving time for itscertification if it should be rejected.Second, July 6th, by which date the Coal legisla-tion must have passed the House of Commons, sinceon July 8th the existing coal legislation would cease to be effective and the coal industry would automatically revert to a 7-hours day.    Consequentlyany new legislation on the subject must receivethe Royal Assent by July 7th.Third, July 10th, by which time the UnemploymentInsurance Fund would again be bankrupt.    Consequentlynot later than July 9th the Royal Assent must begiven to  an Unemployment Bill.The Prime Minister described in some detail thedifficulties with which he was confronted in adjustingthe programme to the above dates, more particularlyin respect of the Finance Bill and the Land TaxationClauses thereof, which were very controversial..The Prime Minister mentioned that he was working for an adjournment, towards the end of July, with theidea of Parliament meeting towards the end ofSeptember or the beginning of October for threeweeks to wind up the present Session,    After thatthe House would rise for a week or two prior to a
fresh Session to &quot;be begun some time in November.The Cabinet agreed that (in the absence of theChancellor of the Exchequer) the President of theBoard of Trade, accompanied by the Financial Secre-tary to the Treasury, should at once see Mr neville chamberlain and Sir Austen Chamberlain in order todiscuss the time-table of the Finance Bill;    andthe Prime Minister undertook to work out the programmefurther.
FUTURE 4.    The Cabinet had before them the followingAIRSHIPPOLICY. documents on Future Airship Policy:-devious A Memorandum by the Secretary ofReference: State for Air &apos;C.P.-93 (31)cabinet 24 covering extracts from the Report(31), Con- of the R.101 Inquiry (Cmd.3825)  onelusion 15.) the Loss of the R.101:A Memorandum bjp. the Secretary ofState for Air (C.P.-94 (31)) onthe question of Future AirshipPolicy.    In this Memorandum theSecretary of State for Airadvocated a policy of a &quot;watchingbrief&quot; under which no new commit-ments would be incurred for thepresent, but there should be closeobservation of the progress inthose countries which were stillpursuing airship development.Two alternatives were submitted for carrying out this policy:either (a) to re-fit and re-commission the R.100 at a cost of 120,000 in 1931,   130,000 in1932,  140,000 in 1933 and there-after:    or (b) to scrap R.100,in which ease the expenditure would be  50,000 in 1931 and notmore than  20,000 in 19 32 and thereafter:A Memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C .P .-118 (31))covering a letter from the Chairmanof the Committee on National Expendi-ture.    In this letter it was recommendation-mended that the proposal of the AirMinistry for the expenditure of 120,000 rising to  140,000 a year on the policy of the &quot;watching brief&quot;should be rejected;    that expenditurein the current year should be restricted to the amount provided in Air Estimates,1931 ( 50,000);    and that expenditurein future years should be kept atleast within the limit of  20,000a year mentioned in C.P.-94, para.12 (b)(ii), subject to examinationof the details by the Treasury.    TheCommittee suggested, however, thatCardinaton should be retained forthe present, the question of disposalbein?? reviewed after three years .In his covering Note the Chancellor  .of the Exchequer supported the abovepolicy .At the outset of the discussion it was suggestedthat the communication to the Cabinet of reports by the Committee on National Expenditure on currentquestions of policy was not a convenient procedure.
and that it would be preferable if in future the opinions of the Committee oould be reserved until they oould be considered as a whole.The discussion disclosed a strong opinion inthe Cabinet against the cheaper policy, moreespecially on the ground that it would involve the closing down of all full-scale experiments .    Inthis connection a letter was read from Sir RichardGTazebrook,  Chairman of the Aeronautical ResearchC ommittee .The dispersal of the staff and of the trained men available for navigating airships was also criticisedand in this connection it was recalled that the closing down of all work on airships after the war had resulted in heavy expenditure in 1924 when ithad been decided to resume their construction.   TheCabinet were reminded, however, that according toone school of thought the futatre of long-distanceair travel lies rather with the heavier-than-airmachine &apos;such as the Dornier-Waal) than with theairship.The Cabinet, in adopting the policy of the&quot;watching brief&quot; set forth in CP.-94 (31), agreed  (a) To approve the larger of the two alternative proposals submitted by(b) That the above policy should be /communicated to the House ofCommons in the form of a reooro-mendation rather than of a decision,    .and that if the House should rejectit the Government should accept their decision:the subject of the announcement.

JjrITIUSIbricanebyeviousllferenoe:-Ijbinet 38JO), Con-conclusion 10 .)m(X5. The Cabinet had. before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP.-119(31)) submitting proposals, which he had agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,  for givingfinancial assistance to the Government of the Colonyof Mauritius owing to the damage occasioned by therecent severe hurricane..    These proposals included the following:-(l) An immediate free gift of  5,000in aid of the relief of actualdistress to be made by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.(2) His Majesty&apos;s Government to guarantee the interest and sinking-fund payments of a loan to be raised by the Govern-ment of Mauritius to cover the costof -(a) repair and replacement ofGovernment property damaged in the hurricane;(b) loans to private persons and companies up to the amount ofthe losses due to the hurricaneby way of damage to property,stock,  etc., and loss of growingcrops;(c) public works which cannot be financed in any other way.The conditions were -(i) The Colonial Government to consent to an investigation of its financialposition by a Financial Commissionto be appointed by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment with a view to devisingmeasures to produce a balancedbudget at the earliest possible date;(ii) As regards (2)(b) above, the loans to be for a period of years to befixed in the circumstances of eachcase subject to a maximum;   to be constituted by law first liens onthe properties involved;    and to be assessed with reference to the amountof hurricane damage and the borrower&apos;sown ability to bear the loss.The cost of the Loan was estimated not to exceed 750,000It was proposed to ask Parliament toauthorise the Treasury to guarantee a loan of
not more than this amount to be raised by theGovernment of Mauritius, subject to the usualconditions on the lines of the Palestine and EastAfrica Loans Act, 1926.   Provision was to be madein the Bill, however, for Exchequer assistance, if required, for the first few years to enable theColony to provide for the service of the Loan.As  it was desirable that the Loan should be raisedbefore August it was proposed to take the necessaryMoney Resolution immediately after Whitsun.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Secretary of State for theColonies as set forth in C.P.-^119(31) and summarised, above.
inURS OF 6 . The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by?L0YMENT the Minister of Labour (CP,-121 (31))  on theL.subject of the Flours of Industrial Employment BillLpevious In this Memorandum, the Minister recalled the reference:Babi.net 66 statement made on behalf of the Government to the1(50), Con-elusion 14-A) .     International Labour Conference that the government R proposed to take the necessary steps to ensure atjjB7^/ the earliest possible moment the ratification ofthe Washington Hours Convention, a statement whichwas repeated in the House of Commons on the 4th July,1929 .   The subsequent negotiations with the variousTrades Unions and Employers&apos;  Organisations were thenfsummarised.   The statement made by authority of thePrime Minister to a recent Deputation of the Leagueof Nations Union was quoted, in which it was explained^that the delay in passing the necessary Bill into lawwas due to lack of Parliamentary time, owing to the congestion of Government business and the prior claims of other measures.    No hope was held out of time being available for the Bill this Session,.   These delays,it was explained in the Memorandum, had created doubt in Geneva as to the real intention of the Governmentto implement the announcement made in 1929.   Thiswas likely to react on the Coal Mine Hours Convention,and our delay was likely to be used by its opponentsas an excuse against action in respect of coal.    Itwas suggested that the most helpful course would be definitely to fix a day on which a Second Readingwould take place, but that almost equivalent to thiswould be an announcement that the Bill would, havefirst place in the Autumn SesBion.,   Alternatively, itwas suggested that the statement made to the Leagueof Nations Union was the least that could be said.
mhe Minister of Labour informed, the Cabinet thatthe same morning she had received a copy of theReport of the Director of the International LabourOffice, in the course of which he had mentioned by name the British and German Governments andhad commented on their failure to carry out theWashington Hours Convention.The Cabinet agreed  That any statement on this subjectmade by the British representative at the meeting of the InternationalLabour Conference,   or in Parliament,should be to the effect that HisMajesty&apos;s Government were in theposition of being obliged to carryout a certain Parliamentary pro-gramme which they could not avoid;that for this reason it was notpossible to pass the Hours ofIndustrial Employment Bill in thepresent Session, but that it wouldbe ijitroduoed as soon as possible.-IS-
7. The President of the Board of Trade informed the Cabinet that he and the Chancellor of theExchequer had had a conversation with the governor of the Bank of England on the subject of there-organisation of the Iron and Steel trade, butthat it would, be necessary to hold another meetingat which the Prime Minister could be present.   he proposed,  therefore, to postpone any statement tothe Cabinet until after this second meeting.
-,-v. LONDONpassengerTransportBILL..If previous Reference:I Cabinet 24(31), Con-elusion 14.)F.R8. The Minister of Transport informed the Cabinetthat he had held a meeting with representative ofthe Main Line Railways and of the Underground group of Railways in connection with the London passenger transport Bill.As regards the Main Lines an agreement in principle was reached on Friday last, which provides definitelyfor a pooling of the passenger receipts of the Boardand the passenger receipts arising -&quot;rom the suburbantraffic of the main lines in the area.   amendments to Clause 22 and also to Clauses 20 and 21 would besubmitted to give effect to these arrangements.The Underground Group had accepted these proposals and their Counsel would be in a position to make astatement to that effect.   The Main Lines would,withdraw their opposition to the Bill.   Variousclause points remained to be dealt with, so thatfor the time being their petitions would not be withdrawn..Co far a-o ooncorncd the Metropolitan Railways,the question was being considered as to whey .   &apos;further discussions could usefully be hv^ld.Tillings were at present makingdifficulties .No negotiations had yet been ouy^ned with independentproprietors.   Negotiations irere actively in progress with Motor Coach interests outside Iondon with aview to seeing; whetb/er agreement could be reached on the basis of/^ome arrangement which would permit of &quot;fringe&quot;y^services on both sides ,    Informal meetingswere taking place with the London County Council with^v^eTw to seeing whether a settlement of terms could.ro reached.
As regards Staff petitions, terms of transfer,superannuation, eto,, the Ministry of Transport wasin totich with the organisations conoerned.On the important question raised by the railway unions of instituting machinery for facilitatingagreements as to terms and conditions of employment,the possibility of devising a machinery which would meet the point of the petitions by the railway unions was under discussion, and there was little doubt that agreement would be reached.The Minister of Transport also raised the questionwhether the London Passenger Transport Board shouldhave power to manufacture .   This power was stronglyobjected to by the manufacturers of commercial vehicles, who maintained that the trade of thecountry, and more particularly the export Jbrade,would suffer if the London Passenger Transport Board,not itself an exporting concern, were to manufactureordersits own vehicles instead of placing with theindustry.    On the other hand, the power of manufacturewas required for checking prices, and for other reasons, some of which commended themselves strongly to members of the Cabinet.    The Minister of Transportasked the guidance of the Cabinet on this subject.The Cabinet agreed  -(a) That the question of power for theLondon Passenger Transport Board to manufacture was rather a large oneto be decided without full informa-tion on the pro&apos;s and conTs of theis sue:(b) That if the Minister of Transportwished to raise it he should circulate Papers:(c) That, pending a decision by theCabinet, a non-committal attitudeshould be adopted.
I electoral reform.Repres enta-tion of thePeople Bill,The UniversityVote .(previous reference:Cabinet 22(31), Con-clusion 9.)f.R.9.   The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet thata group of the Government&apos;s supporters had put downan amendment to the Report Stage of the Representa-tion of the People Bill with a view to reinstatingthe Clause abolishing University representation.As the Government had already announced their intention to accept the decision of the House ofCommons to reject this  Clause, the re-opening of thequestion was inconvenient.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Home Secretary should seethe Members of Parliament who had put down the amendment and should explain to them the inconvenienceof their action.    In addition,  thePrime Minister undertook, if possible,to see some of the Members:(b) That the Home Secretary should reporton the subject at the next Meetingof the Cabinetf2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,May 13, 1931..
