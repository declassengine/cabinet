national expenditure.Report of theMay Committeeon national expenditure.(previous reference:Cabinet 40(51Conclusion 10The Cabinet met in circumstances of exceptional gravity and urgency to considerthe recent serious developments in thefinancial situation of the country.      In thisconnection there were circulated to the membersof the Cabinet at the meeting a most secret memorandum (Paper CP. 203 (51))  containingsuggestions for balancing the Budget, preparedby the Cabinet Committee under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister, which had been appointedat the meeting referred to in the margin,to examine the Report of the Committee on national Expenditure, and to report thereon tothe Cabinet as soon as possible.The meeting of the Cabinet which beganat 11.0 a.m. continued until 10.30 p.m. withshort adjournments at mid-day and at 7.0 p.m.- At the outset of the proceedings specialemphasis was laid on the vital importance in thenational interests, of safeguarding the secrecy of the facts and figures disclosed to theCabinet, and it was agreed, that the copies ofthe most secret memorandum mentioned above,should be returned to the Deputy Secretary afterthe conclusion of the meeting.The Prime Minister, the Chancellor of theExchequer and other members of the CabinetCommittee, explained the grave character of thefinancial position, the reasons for immediate1.
action and the- various measures, designed to securebudgetary equilibrium, which in the view of the committee must be taken forthwith if public confidence at home andabroad is to be re-established and a financial crisis ofthe first magnitude averted.The Cabinet reviewed the problem as a whole in all its bearings and in the course of a very full discussion inwhich all members of the Cabinet participated, consideration was given, inter alia, to the political and economicreactions of the suggestions in CP. 203 (31) and also toother matters, such as proposals for Debt Conversion and aRevenue Tariff, connected therewith.In the course of the discussion it became clearthat while the Cabinet were prepared, though with reluctance,to accept as a temporary measure to meet the present emergency, certain of the economies set out in CP. 203 (31)(subject in certain cases to further consultation betweenthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the departmental ministers concerned), the Cabinet were not prepared to entertain the main recommendations of the May Committee inregard to Unemployment Insurance, including the proposal(rejected by the Cabinet Committee) for a reduction of benefits, and also a suggestion that persons who have fallenout of insurance should be handed over to the PublicAssistance Authorities.     It was also argued amongst other things that in the case of Transitional Benefit, thearrangements in contemplation would involve financialburdens on the local authorities which the great majorityof those authorities would be unable to bear.
The Conclusions reached by the Cabinet may besummarised as follows:-1.
