1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs invited his colleagues to give careful attention tothe telegrams circulated from Egypt.   The opposition had. been making attacks on the Government and tosome extent on the British High Commissioner, butthere were signs of a movement towards reconciliationand interesting developments might take place.
2.The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C.P.-138(31)) reporting the position of the negotiationswith the Chinese Government for the abolition ofextraterritoriality, which had now reached a crucialpoint.   The whole Treaty had now been negotiated,with the exception of two points, namely,(a)  duration(b) reserved areas .   As the British Minister at peking had reported that it is futile to expect that the Chinese will ever sign a Treaty if it isto be perpetual, agreement was now being sought for a Treaty of ten years&apos;  duration, after whichthe Chinese, if they so desire, would be at liberty to terminate it.    The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs advised that it would be wise to accept thetime -limits of ten years for the duration of theTreaty as a whole, with five years for the special arrangements relating to Special  Courts and LegalCounsellors, together with perpetuity for themost-favoured-nation treatment described in Article18 of the Treaty, whereby British subjects wouldenjoy in perpetuity &quot;all exemptions from Chinese&quot;jurisdiction which may be enjoyed by the nationals*of any other country and shall be subjected to no&quot;discriminatory treatment in respect of taxation,&quot;judicial or any other matters for which this Treaty&quot;provides, as compared with the nationals of any&quot;other country&quot;.     The point still in dispute withregard to the reserved areas was whether Britishsubjects in these areas are to pass automaticallyunder Chinese jurisdiction after a fixed period, orwhether the transfer of jurisdiction should takeplace only in accordance with special arrangementsagreed to after due negotiations.    Sir Miles Lampson
1  t) &amp;had secured an offer of the exclusion of GreaterShanghai for ten years, after which British subjectswould automatically pass under Chinese jurisdiction.Arguments against accepting a fixed time limit for.the exclusion of Shanghai from the operation of theTreaty had been fully expounded in a telegram toSir Miles. Lampson.   The leaders of the Shanghaicommunity, the Consul-General at  Shanghai andSir Miles Lamps on were agreed that the Chinese offer should be accepted as it stands.    Judge Feetham, onthe other hand, held the view that was put toSir Miles Lampson in detail by the Foreign office telegram, namely, that a fixed time limit ties arope round the neck of the Settlement .    In the viewof the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,exclusion for a period of ten years, in spite of the obvious objections to a fixed time limit, was themost favourable settlement that we could hope tosecure.   As the Chinese Minister for Foreign affairs had made it plain that he was not in a positionactually to sign the Treaty at this moment but was ready to agree on the text as between himself andSir Miles Lampson for the consideration of the twoGovernments, the suggestion of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs was that Sir Miles Lampsonshould be authorised to exchange letters withdraw. Wang agreeing as between themselves on the text of the Treaty as negotiated, and reserving it for confirmation by the Chinese Government and HisMajesty&apos;s Government.The Memorandum summarised above had been beforethe Cabinet at the Meeting on the previous day,referred to in the margin, and had been reservedfor consideration when the Prime Minister was present.
In the course of the discussion the Secretaryof State for India said he wished to draw attentionto one matter of detail.   He understood that underthe new arrangements British citizens would be triedin a Chinese Court, but according to English law.In Sinkiang, however, Indians (of whom there were considerable numbers) were dealt with according to indian law.   He hoped that arrangements might be madefor them to be dealt with in the future also accordingto Indian and not English law,The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs invited the Secretary of State for India to communi-cate with him on the subject.The Cabinet agreed  That Sir Miles Lampson should beauthorised to exchange letters withdraw.. Wang agreeing as between them-selves on the text of the Treaty asnegotiated and reserving it for confirmation by the Chinese Govern--ment and His Majesty&apos;s Government.
3. The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the Home &quot;Wheat Quota Scheme:-An Interim Report of the Agricul-tural Development Committee(CP .-52 (31)):A Memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP .-89 (31)):A Memorandum by the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries on agricultural Depression in South-East Yorkshire (CP .-85 (31)):A Note by the Secretary coveringtwo Memoranda to the Prime minister by Government supporters represent-ing agricultural constituencies(CP.-112 (31)):A Despatch from His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Berlin (CP,-133 (31)).All the above had been before the Cabinet at theprevious Meeting,  except the last-named, which hadbeen circulated by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs at the request of the Lord President of theCouncil.The Prime Minister made a verbal report to theCabinet on the results of enquiries he had made asto the agricultural position in Scotland, where hehad seen a number of representative farmers.    all had agreed that tariffs would not provide a cureand that they would tend to drive a wedge betweenthe agricultural interests and the national interests as represented, by towns .   All had agreed thatagriculture in Scotland was in a parlous position.Instances had been given of farmers who werelosing money heavily and whose position had becomeprecarious.     Labour was being discharged on a large scale and many labourers were houseless.      Thosewhom he had consulted had agreed that the situation was urgent and that it centred round cereal farming.His information was that a wheat quota did not meet the needs of Scotland, but that they wouldlike to have a barley quota in addition, notnecessarily involving a fixed price.
The Secretary of State for Scotland said his information was that the Scottish farmers desireda quota both for wheat and barley .The Prime Minister then explained the political position in relation to a quota,    ^he Leader of theConservative Party had announced a policy of a quotaon wheat with a fixed price, the difference betweenthe fixed price and the world price being made up bythe Treasury so as to obviate any increase in thecost of living.    The plan before the Cabinet, underwhich the difference in price would be passed on tothe consumer, would be an awkward one to defendagainst the above alternative.    In any event, however,it was very doubtful if the Government could rely onsufficient support,  either from its own Party or fromthe Liberals, to ensure carrying the policy of the quota without the votes of their opponents.The trend of the discussion which followed maybe summed up as follows: r-(l) There is not a sufficient measure ofagreement at the present time on thepolicy of a wheat quota,  either inthe Cabinet itself or among those members of Parliament on whosesupport the Government normally rely,to justify its adoption as the mainfeature of the Government&apos;s cerealpolicy:(2) Up to the present time, apart fromthe Quota Scheme no practicable stephas been laid before the Cabinet for putting cereal-growing in this country on an economic foundation,  and somewider basis than cereal-growing mustbe sought for overcoming the present unsatisfactory state of agriculture:(3) One of the most hopeful dirootiofjfe f-e?-advance appears to lie in the directionof.developing and stimulating by suit-able organisation the home cultivation of various forms of agricultiiral produce.which at present are mainly imported from overseas, such as meat, poultry,eggs, butter, cheese, vegetables, fruit,etc.    Such a policy,  it was felt,would be a logical and consistentdevelopment of the Agricultural Policyof the Government as announced by the
Chancellor of the Exchequer in the.House of Commons on August 1,  1950,the first stages of which areincorporated in the agricultural marketing Bill and the agricultural land (Utilisation) Bill:(if)    Means should be studied for effecting a transition,  to such extent as may be found feasible, fromcereal growing to more profitableforms of agriculture.      It was recognised that the transitionmust necessarily occupy some considerable time.(5) Any special assistance to theagricultural industry should be associated with added security for the standards of life of theagricultural worker,.The Cabinet agreed --(a) That the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries and the Secretaryof State for Scotland, with theassistance of Officials of theirrespective Departments and in communication with the treasury as far as necessary, should prepare plans to encourage and stimulate the transfer, as rapidly as maybe feasible from an economic pointof view,  of agricultural effortfrom the cultivation of cerealsto other forms of produce in allcases where this was likely to beprofitable,    as well as for helpingcereal areas in the meantime in anyway that may be politically acceptable:(b) That the Chancellor of the Exchequer^the First Lord of the Admiralty,  thePresident of the Board of Trade andthe Lord Privy Seal should be : v,available, either individuallyor collectively,  to confer with orassist the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries and/or the Secretaryof State for Scotland in connectionwith the preparation of &quot;the aboveplans.
AG R IC&apos;UliTTJRALPOLICY.The DominionWheat QuotaScheme.(previous previous reference:Cabinet 27(31), Con-elusion 9.)73&amp;()34. The Cabinet had. before them the following documents relating to the Dominion Wheat QuotaScheme:-The Second. Report of the ottawa conference Committee (CP.-107 (31)):A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs (CP.-139(31)).The subject was not raised, at the cabinet meeting as the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs had stated at the Cabinet Meeting on theprevious day that the Ottawa Conference had been postponed.
UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCEFUND .(previous reference:Cabinet 29(31), Con-clusion 14.)a.to.5.    The Prime Minister recalled that before the recess a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows -The Secretary of State for Y-ar,The Minister of Labour,The Minister of Health,The Financial Secretary to the Treasury -all of whom would be in or near London, had beenappointed at the Meeting referred to in the marginto make a preliminary survey of the Interim Reportof the Royal Commission on Unemployment insurance and to advise the Cabinet as to the procedure theyshould adopt,   &quot;hen that Committee was appointedit had been on the assumption that the Report wouldprobabl3^ be published during the Recess and that itwould deal mainly with the question of abuses.    It nasnow known that the Interim Report (which would be circulated to the Cabinet either the same eveningor early on the following morning) was of a much moreformidable character,  covering a large part of thequestion of Unemployment Insurance.    In the circum-stances he thought it would be wise to add othermembers to the Cabinet Committee,The Cabinet agreed  That the following should be addedto the Cabinet Committee:-The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs.The Lord Privy Seal.2, Whitehall Gardens,&apos; S.W.1,June 4, 19 31.
