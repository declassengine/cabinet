AUSTRIA.(previous reference:Cabinet 32(31), Con-clusion 6.)X1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet at the outset of the meeting that the Austrian Government had found it necessaryto resign in consequence of the financial crisis.Later in the Meeting he received and read to theCabinet telegrams Nos . 55 and 56 from Sir E.Phipps(Vienna) containing particulars of an officialdeclaration which the French Government had demanded,that the Austrian Government should give before8 o&apos;clock on the evening of the previous day as theprice of French subscription to the scheme for150,000,000 Treasury Bonds for Austria.   Theseconditions were of a very drastic character,including an immediate request to be made byAustria to the League of Nations for an inquiry into the economic and financial situation ofAustria&apos; an undertaking in advance to adoptand put into practice any measure which the council may propose or recommend to it as the result ofthis Inquiry;    and a statement to the FrenchGovernment  (which France should have the right to publish) that the request for enquiry by theCouncil of the League implied a formal renunciationby Austria of any economic or political combination of such a nature as to modify the international status of Austria.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, said.th?4-  a meeting to consider this situation hadalready been arranged to take place the same afternoon between the Permanent Under-Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross and. the Governor of the Bank of England.r-lr-
The Cabinet agreed  To leave the matter toThe Prime Minister,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State forForeign Affairs,in consultation to such extent asthey should desire with theauthorities mentioned above.
2. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs stated that Sir Miles Lamps on had reported that hehas concluded, his negotiations with Dr. Wang andhas exchanged texts of the proposed Treaty in regardto extraterritoriality ad, referendum to therespective Governments.    The texts are in accordancewith the authority given to Sir Miles Lamps onexcept in one particular, namely, the condition for perpetuity of most-favoured-nation treatment.In the Secretary of State&apos;s Memorandum approved bythe Cabinet on June 3rd it had been stated that we proposed in any case that one Article ClJo.18), &apos;securing most-favoured-nation treatment, should bemade perpetual.    Sir Miles Laropson had abandonedthis condition without further reference to theSecretary of State, telling Dr. Wang that he did soon his own responsibility and explaining to theSecretary of State that he had taken this action for the reason that he felt that developments atCanton made it essential to terminate the negotia-tions, and that in any case the whole arrangement,come to between him and Dr. Wang was ad referendumto the two Governments.   The Secretary of Statethought it regrettable that Sir Files Lamps on hadnot found it possible to secure the agreement of dr . Wang to perpetual mos t-f avoured-nat ion treatment.As it is, if the Treaty came into force such treatment-was only secured for a period of ten years.Nevertheless he saw no reason on this account why he should not congratulate Sir Miles Lampson on theresults achieved.   He proposed to do this, with an indication&apos; to him at the same time that the Govern-ment are disappointed that he had not succeeded inobtaining Dr. Wang&apos;s assent on this point.
The Cabinet approved, the above proposal, but suggested, that theSecretary of State should, phrasehis expression of disappointmentin such a way as not to reflecton Sir Miles Lampson&apos;? handling of the question.-4-
3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed theCabinet that the technical arrangements for imple-menting the understanding with the Liberal Party-were still rather involved.   The Liberals had putdown their Amendment in the form of a new Clause,but he was advised by Parliamentary Counsel thatthis was likely to be out of order.    It nowtranspired that, apart from the ruling of theChairman of Committees on the previoiis  day, the revised Liberal Amendment wrould probably have beenout of order in any event, for the reason that itwas contrary to decisions already taken during theCommittee Stage on As^fe-ie-ibe-s ^ and 14 of the FinanceEill.   The same reason was likely to operate against the new Clause.    It appeared, therefore,that an opportunity to implement the Liberalproposal was not likely to arise except on theReport Stage.    It might be necessary to alterClauses ^ and 14 of the Eill.    He was watching thesituation very carefully,  in order to discover thebest method of handling the question.In a short discussion that followed, it was generally recognised that there was hardly a doubtthat the Government would its elf have to move thenecessary additions and/or alterations to the Bill,and the Chancellor of the Exchequer was invited toexplain the situation to the Liberals.    There was general agreement also that an Amendment should notbe put down until it was assured that it would becalled, for discussion.
$0PLCYMEW?&apos; URANCF..previous reference:Cabinet 32&apos;31), Con-elusion 10.)a.4. The Cabinet had before them the second report of the Cabinet Committee (CP.-153 (31))covering -(i) Draft of Unemployment Insurance^No.4) Bill (borrowing andtransitional benefit):(ii) Draft Clauses of UnemploymentInsurance fNo.3) Bill (methodof dealing with anomalias.^.The recommendations of the Committee in respectof the two draft Bills, which were appended to theirReport, were as follows:-(l) That the Minister of Labour shouldbe authorised to introduce theUnemployment Insurance (No.4) Billin the House of Commons in the formof the draft set out in Appendix Ito CP.-153 (31), subject to any drafting or other minor alterations that may be found necessary or desirable:(2) That approval shoiild be given to theUnemployment Insurance (No.3) Billin the form of the draft annexed as appendix II to CP.-153 (31), subjectto any drafting or other minor alter-ations that may be found necessary or desirable:(3) That the Minister of Labour should beauthorised, to introduce the (No.3) Billin the House of Commons, if possible before the Debate on the financial resolution on the UnemploymentInsurance (No*4) Bill, and to explain the Government&apos;s intentions on thelines of paragraph 8 of CP.-153. (31).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,as Chairman, explained that the Cabinet Committeehad had to hold a number of meetings and had workedunder great pressure.   He paid, a tribute to theco-operation of Parliamentary Draftsmen and theCabinet Secretariate   He emphasised the difficultiesof incorporating in an Act of Parliament steps fordealing with anomalies without creating opportunities for equally glaring abuses that would impose hard-ships on ,persons who were seeking, work.   The con-clusion of the Committee, therefore, was that the
only way to deal with the question was to &apos;givediscretion to the Minister of Labour, within limitsprescribed by Statute, and to provide for an AdvisoryCommittee to assist the Minister.   This course was undoubtedly open to some objections, and would be criticised in Parliament, but in all the circumstance;was deemed less objectionable than any other course.The points on which discussion mainly concentratedwere the following:-(I). As to whether the Regulations should comeinto operation automatically after being laid fora prescribed number of d-^ys before the House ofCommons, unless an adverse decision was taken bythe House;    or, alternatively, whether they 3houldrequire a positive Resolution of the House to bring them into operation.   Precedents for- both courseswere quoted.It was recognised that there would be strong pressure from certain quarters in the &apos;-&quot;ouse ofprocedureCommons in favour of/by affirmative Resolution, butthat administratively this would be very disadvan-tageous and must be resisted,(II).. The question of Married Women,  dealt with/in Clause 1 (2)  (d)  of the Bill.    The discussionrevealed the great difficulty in removing admittedabuses in the receipt of unemployment benefit bymarried women without inflicting real hardship, andthe Minister of Labour informed the Cabinet that(d)v --as at present drafted, was unsatisfactory.,&quot;&quot;he partieularisation of &quot;married women&quot; as a classby theirs elves was criticised.It was explained that the classes of person   to -whom the section dealing with anomalies applied in clause 1 (2) were the same as those dealt&quot;with inthe Report of the Royal Commission, which had
discussed &quot;married women&quot; at great length.    It wassuggested, however, that there would be advantages,if it were possible, in avoiding express reference in the Bill to &quot;married women&quot; and in drafting theClause so as to avoid that terra.    One suggestion made in this respect was that (d) should refer to&quot;Persons whose title to be considered as personsnormally employed in insurable employment is in doubt&quot;, and the Minister- of labour was invited toconsider this proposal.fill). A Table (Appendix) which was circulated bythe Minister of Labour during the Meeting to illus-trate a scheme which had been discussed with repre-sentatives of the mrades Union Congress general council for determining benefit in certain casesof casual and part-time workers receiving- substantialwages.    The illustrations compared three plans,according as deduction from total benefit due shouldbe half excess over (i)  30/--- a week earnings^(ii) 25/*- a week earnings,  (iii) 20/- a week earnings&apos;&apos;.It was explained that this Table was not requiredfor inclusion in the Bill, but only as the basis of regulations..      Nevertheless, an early decision bythe Cabinet was necessary as to which basis wasto be  taken, as the Minister would undoubtedly be pressed to furnish explanations of the Govern-menfs intention during the Debates on the Bill.It was pointed out that under these proposalsa casual or part-time worker earning as little as30/- a weeK would receive more than a fully employedman in some other industries,  even if a basis of 25/-were taken.      This, however, was recognisei. to be
one of the fundamental objections to the presentsystem of Unemployment Insurance which the RoyalCommission was investigating.(IV). The question of whether there should be two Bills or one Bill, which was considered fromthe point of view of Parliamentary time.It was explained that the Unemployment Insurance(No .4) Bill must be passed before July 8th. If theprovisions of the Unemployment Insurance (.No..3) bill were incorporated into the (No .4) Bill it could notbe certified as a Money Bill and consequently wouldbe liable to amendment by the House of Lords, butthis risk was not regarded very seriously.It was realised that if there were only a singleBill the whole Bill would have to remain on the floor of the House of Commons in Committee Stage,and the discussion of anomalies would require a gooddeal of Parliamentary time.    The Cabinet were reminds!in this connection that there was- much obstructionand delay at the present time on Bills in StandingCommittee..    If the Liberal Party were willing toagree that the Unemployment Insurance fNo.3) Bill,dealing with anomalies, should be considered in committee upstairs,  it was thought probably worth,while to have two Bills,    Otherwise it &quot;appeared, thattime would be saved by a single Bill.The Lord Privy Seal, by arrangement with theMinister of Labour, was invited to confer on thesubject at once with representatives of theLiberal Party,  and to report to the Prime Minister.The Cabinet agreed  -(a)  To approve the substance of the Unom-ployment Insurance (No.. 4.)  and (No.  3)Bills in the form of the drafts con-tained in CP.-153 (3&quot;0? Appendices Iand II, subject to any drafting or other minor alterations that might be foundnecessary or desirable, and subject tothe following relating to UnemploymentInsurance (No, 3) Bill:-
(i) That as regards Regulationsany attempt to insist on a positive Resolution byParliament in order to bringthe Regulations into operation should be resisted:fii) That the Minister of labour should consider carefully the wording of Clause 1 (S)(d) ofthe Bill, dealing with marriedwomen, including the proposal that the term &quot;married women&quot;should, if possible, be eliminated:(iii) That the Regulations for det-er-mining benefit in certain casesof casual and part-time workersreceiving substantial wages should be on the basis ofdeducting from the total benefitdue half the excess over 35/-earnings, unless the CabinetCommittee should make a contraryrecommendation before the next meeting of the Cabinet:(b) ^hat the Lord Privy Seal, by arrange-ment with the Minister of Labour,should at once consult representativesof the Liberal Party as to what theirattitude would be in Parliament towardsthe two Unemployment Insurance Bills,and should report the position to thePrime Minister, who would then decide as to whether, there should be one bill or two Bills:sfc) &quot;Taat the Minister of Labour shouldlay the Financial Resolution and white Paper in connection with unemployment Insurance fNo.4) bill the same day.NOTE:    It was arranged that the Minister of Health,the Lord Privy Seal and the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury should holdthemselves ready to confer with the PrimeMinister at the same time as the Ministerof Labour on this question as affectingthe Parliamentary time-table.
C    The Cabinet had before them the Report(CP. 1 Rlf (3&quot;1))  of the Cabinet Committee whichhad been appointed at the Meeting referred to inthe margin to consider the Memorandum by the Secretaryfor Mines (CP,  1 if  (3&quot;0)  dealing with the MinesDepartment Emergency Organisation.      Appended tothe Report was a Note by the Home Secretary,  covering the Report of an Inter-Departmental Conference.After hearing a short report by the PrimeMinister on prospects in the Coal Industry,  theCabinet agreed  To adjourn the consideration ofthe above Report until the following week.The Prime Minister once more drew attention to the importance ofreticence on the subject of thisReport,

rural housing.(previous reference:Cabinet 38(31)    Con-conclusion 13.)a.3s ii)^8.  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Health (CP.-152 (31)) reporting the results of a conference he had undertaken , inaccordance with the decision of the Cabinet referredto in the margin, with the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries, the Secretary of State for Scotland,the Lord Privy Seal and a representative of theChancellor of the Exchequer.Subject to the approval of the Chancellor of theExchequer (whose representative was unable to agree)the Ministers present had agreed to recommend theadoption of the scheme submitted in Appendix ffA&quot;to CP.-143 (31), subject to the following altera-tion:-Paragraph 3 (l) - A limit offive pence per head of poptila-tion to be substituted for fourpence per head of population inthe first condition to besatisfied by Rural district councils who are eligible tomake applications for special assistance.Th^ desire of the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries that additional assistance under thescheme should be available to necessitous rural district Councils in respect of houses foragricultural workers not only in agriculturalbut also in non-agricultural parishes had notbeen met as the Chancellor of the Exchequer was understood not to be prepared to agree.The Chancellor of the Exchequer warned the Cabinet that the Committee on national economy was likely, according to reports he hadreceived,  to make some very strong criticism of the expendi fcure on housing.      The Cabinet
were reminded., however,  that the present proposals had been made in order to implement an understanding with the Leaders of the Liberal Party, and possessedimportance from the point of view of relief ofunemployment.      It was recognised that if it was to achieve this object it was essential that it shouldbe introduced during the present Session.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To authorise the Minister ofHealth to prepare a Bill on the.    -^asis of CP.  1R2 (31), and tosubmit it to the Cabinet throughthe usual  channel;(b) That the Minister of Health shouldalso be authorised to inform theLibex^al Party that the Bill wasbeing drafted.
9.   The Cabinet had under consideration a 1O0Memorandum by the Minister of Transport (H.A.-22(31)) covering the draft Road Traffic (Amendment)Bill, the principle of which had been approved bythe Cabinet at the Meeting referred to in the margin.Its effect was to repeal Sub-Section 3 of Section 61of the Road Traffic Act, 1930, which had ruled outthe use of vehicles of the lorry type for the freeconveyance of eight or more passengers, e.g.,cricketand football teams, school treats, workpeople&apos;soutings,  etc.The Committee of Home Affairs had agreed torecommend to the Cabinet:-To authorise the introduction inthe House of Lords of the road traffic (Amendment) Bill in theform of the draft annexed with*A.-S2 (31), subject to any drafting or other minor altera-tions that may be found necessary or desirable, on the understandingthat its further progress must-depend on its being treated asunc ontrovers ial.
