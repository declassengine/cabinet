THE FINANCIAL &quot;With reference to the ConclusionSITUATION ANDTHE INTER- mentioned in the margin, the Cabinet met toPARTYDISCUSSIONS. receive a report from the Prime Minister on(Previous Ref-     the meeting with the Leaders of the Oppositioner enc e:Cabinet 44 (31)   Parties which had taken place earlier in theConclusion3 (1)). day.F.R. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinetthat he had told the Party Leaders the exactposition and those present all realised the serious-ness of the situation which had developed.    taking advantage of the authority given by the Cabinetto himself and the Chancellor of the Exchequerhe had then sounded the Party Leaders as towhether they would regard as satisfactory an addition of a further  SO millions gross to the list of economies to be made up as to  12^ millionsby a 10 per cent, reduction in Unemployment.Insurance Benefit, and as to  7-^ millions inother ways:-   it being distinctly understood thatin making this inquiry they were merely seekinginformation, and that the Government were in no way committed to the proposal.The Party Leaders were unable to give any definite reply beyond indicating that thequestion was one which in their opinion, shouldbe put to the financial authorities responsiblefor raising the contemplated loan in New York and paris.      Both he and the Chancellor of theExchequer had derived the impression that if thehanking interests were ready to regard the proposition as adequate and satisfactory theParty Leaders would accept it, but Mr. neville chamberlain had made a reservation to the effect
that acceptance of the proposition &quot;by the conservatives must not be taken as precluding theConservative Party from pressing for further reductions on Unemployment Insurance when thelegislation was before the House of Commons.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinetthat he had invited the Deputy Governor of the Bankof England to come to Downing Street at 3.0 p.m. that afternoon, and he invited the views of the Cabineton the question whether the Chancellor of theExchequer and himself should now be authorised to address the same inquiry to the Deputy Governor whichthey had addressed to the Party Leaders and on precise-ly the same basis, namely that the question was put to elicit information and that the Government were inno respect committed to the proposition.It was probable that the Deputy Governor would reply to the effect that he was unable to give any definite answer without first submitting the question in great confidence to Mr. Harrison of the federal reserve Bank,    Mr. Harrison would himself have tomake confidential enquiries in New York and there might be some little delay in getting a reply.Mr. Harrison had, however, intimated that providedconfidence could be re-established there would be nolack of American money forthcoming.After some discussion, in the course of whichit was suggested that before the Prime Minister and theChancellor of the Exchequer saw the bankers, the cabinet should reach a conclusion on whether or not they wouldbe prepared to implement the proposition, provided itwas satisfactorjr to the banking interests, it waspointed out that the Government would be in a very embarrassing position if, after an affirmative reply
had been received to the hypothetical question, theCabinet were to decide that they could not implement the proposition.The Cabinet agreed -(l) To authorise the Prime Minister andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer toascertain from the Representatives ofthe Bank of England whether they would regard as satisfactory the additionof a further  20 millions gross to the list of economies to be made up as to 12^ millions by a 10 per cent,reduction in Unemployment insurance benefit and as to  7f millions in otherways; it being distinctly understoodthat in making this inquiry they were merely seeking information, and thatthe Government were in no way committed to the proposal.(2) That the Representatives of the Bank ofEngland might be given permission todiscuss the question confidentiallywith the Federal Reserve Bank authorities.Note.    The Prime Minister and theChancellor of the Exchequer thenwithdrew and conferred with Sir e.Harvey and Mr. Peacock.At the close of this conference the Prime&apos;Minister informed the Cabinet that the Representativesof the Bank of England had not rejected the suggestionbut had undertaken to get in touch at once with Mr.Harrison, and on hearing from New York would communicate with the Prime Minister.      If the answer was favourablethe Prime Minister proposed to see the Leaders of theOpposition Parties again and to discuss further withthem the parliamentary situation.     If the answer from new York was unfavourable, it was not proposed tohave any further meeting with the Party Leaders.The Cabinet agreed -(l) To approve the procedure suggested bythe Prime Minister.
