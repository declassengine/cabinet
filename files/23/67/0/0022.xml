THE FINANCIALPOSITION.Resignation ofthe Government,(previous reference:Cabinet46 (31)conclusion (IV).).1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinetthat, as a result of the failure to reach agreement on the previous day, the financial position had greatlydeteriorated, and the situation was now one of the gravest possible character.As had then been arranged, His Majesty hadreceived Mr. Baldwin, Sir Herbert Samuel and himself in audience that morning, and it was quite clear thatno useful purpose would be served by consideration ofany question other than that of saving the country from financial collapse.    The proposal was that HisMajesty would invite certain individuals, as individuals,  to take upon their shoulders the burdenof carrying on the Government, and Mr. Baldwin andSir Herbert Samuel had stated that they were preparedto act accordingly._^The Prime Minister then stated that he proposed to tender to His Majesty the resignation ofthe Government.     He had not failed to present thecase against his participation in the proposedAdministration, but in view of the gravity of thesituation he had felt that there was no other course open to him than to assist in the formation.of a National Government on a comprehensive basis for the purpose of meeting the present emergency.aThe new Cabinet would be/very small one ofabout 12 Ministers, and the Administration wouldnot exist for a period longer than was necessaryto dispose of the emergency, and when that purpose
Q C Qwas achieved the political Parties would resume their respective positions.    The administration would not he a Coalition Government in the usualsense of the term, hut a Government of co-operation for this one purpose.It had been agreed that at the GeneralElection which would follow the end of the emergencyperiod, there would be no &quot;coupons&quot;, pacts or other party arrangements.     During the emergency periodefforts would be made to prevent contests at by-elections, but if such contests took place it wouldbe open to the Leaders of the Conservative and liberal Parties to send letters to their candidates.While the Administration held Office, itwas not proposed that there should be any PartyLegislation, but efforts would be made to arrangefor the passage into law of measures in regard to whichthe three Parties were in substantial agreement.The Prime Minister gave       an example of such legislation - The London Traffic Bill - and intimated that he thought that arrangements could be made tosecure the passage of that Bill into law*The Prime Minister added that he had obtained assurances to the effect that the generalscheme of economies to be placed before parliament by the new Administration would be on the lines of theproposals which had been submitted to the Bankers,including the ten per cent cut in UnemploymentInsurance.    In effect, therefore, there would be no serious departure from the scheme which at their meeting on August 22nd (Cabinet 45 (31))2.
e.) Q Go 0 jthe Cabinet had authorised the Chancellor and himself to submit tentatively to the Leaders of theOpposition Parties and to the bankers.In reply to an enquiry about the approximatedate of the General Election, the Prime ministers aid that nothing whatever had, as yet, been decidedabout this matter.The Cahinet agreed -(1) That the Prime Minister should place the resignation of the Government inthe hands of His Majesty the King that afternoon.(2) That it was hoped that arrangements could be made so that Ministers mightsurrender their Seals possibly on tuesday, August 25th, and in any case with the least possible delay.(3) To adhere to the procedure of their predecessors in regard to cabinet documents:    that is to say, ministers should retain such Cabinet documents&quot;as they desired, on the understandingthat as ex-Ministers they should have access to Cabinet Minutes and other documents issued during their periodof Office, .xx Note.    Owing to the fact that no formalmeeting of the Cabinet was held after theGeneral Election of 1929, the Cabinet records of that year contain no conclusion regardingthe custody of Cabinet documents.    There is,however, no reason to doubt that had theConservative Government held a final meetingof the Cabinet toeforB resigning Office, theResolution would have been in terms identical with that given above, which is copied from theConclusions of the last meeting of the cabinet of the Labour Government in November,
the Report of the Cabinet Committee on the Report ofthe Committee on National Expenditure) had been returned by all Members of the Cabinet to the deputy Secretary, and that without those documentsit would be difficult, if not impossible, for individual Members of the Cabinet hereafter toknow precisely how far they were committed withregard to the various proposals set out in the documents in question.The Cabinet agreed  That there should be returned to each Cabinet Minister his copyof the most secret papers(CP.203(31) and CP.203(31)(Revise)).EE-CIRCULATION     2. Several Members of the Cabinet drewOP CERTAINCABINET attention to the fact that the copies of mostDOCUMENTS.secret papers (CP.203(31) and CP. 203( 31) (Revise) -

On the motion of the Lord ChancellorPRIME MINISTER.the Cabinet placed on record their warm appreciation of the great kindness, consideration and courtesyinvariably shown by the Prime Minister whenpresiding over their meetings and conductingthe business of the Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.24th August,  1931.
