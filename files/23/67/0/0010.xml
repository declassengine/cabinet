Preparationsintfr-PTUilED DEBTSresidentippverT sIppoposal.(previous reference:Cabinet 37(29), Con-clusion 5.)F.R.1 - The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C.P.-158 (31)) on thesubject of President Hoover&apos;s proposal for a suspension of debt payments.His Majesty&apos;s Government having announced their acceptance of the American proposal in principle andtheir readiness to co-operate in carrying it intopractical effect without delay, the. following action was recommended:-(-1)Reparations.    It is most urgent,  ifpossible, to secure the agreement ofthe principal creditor governments to the suspension of the German payments as from 15th July, when the next instal-ment is due.    It was suggested that the simplest method was for the creditorGovernments to notify the Bank for international Settlements of suchsuspension.    In the event of Pranceraising difficulties the United states were deemed to have better means of bringing them round than we have.For. .the moment,  therefore, no action wascons ideredFrance.advisable in regard to(S) Other International Debts .    It wassuggested to announce forthwith thatas soon as President Hoover&apos;s proposal has been generally accepted Hie Majesty&apos;sGovernment ivin be ready to suspend forone year all international debts due tothem by European countries and that inthe meanttoe they would refrain fromclaiming instalments that may fall due^It was further suggested that the treasury should convene immediately a meeting ofthe Relief Credits Committee with a view7to informing the other Governments holdingRelief Bonds of our action and invitingthem to take similar action..(3) Dominions and India.   The obligations ofthe Dominions and India to the UnitedKingdom are a domestic matter for theBritish Commonwealth and cannot be madethe subject of, undertakings to foreign powers. . Taking into account the economicand financial difficulties with whichmost of the Dominions are at grips., itwas suggested to inform the Dominionsand India of the American proposal,,,invite their assent to the suspension of the German payments, and say that weare prepared to Five them the option of postponing the full amount of their war debt payments to, the United. kingdom for a period of a year if they desire toavail themselves of this facility..
(4) Financial effect to the British. Budget.The loss to the British Budget in theabove proposals was estimated at 11,000,000,  or over  12,000,000 ifwe add the Australian Sinking Fundpayments of  1,600,000 which we hadalready agreed to suspend.(5) It was suggested that if His Majesty&apos;sGovernment agree to the applicationof the proposal on the above lines,an early opportunity should be takento make a full statement on the subject in the House of Commons so that ourposition may be properly appreciated.Nothing was more likely to influenceFrance in the direction that we desirethan the discovery that this countryalso loses a very substantial amountfrom the American proposal.Annexed to the Chancellor of the Exchequer^Memorandum was a detailed Memorandum by the treasury on President Hoover&apos;s proposal.At the outset of the Meeting the Chancellor of theExchequer handed round a draft of a Statement to bemade in Parliament the same afternoon, which he read to the Cabinet (Appendix) .   He added that the PrimeMinister on the previous evening had agreed that, aStatement on these lines, in the form approved by theCabinet, should be made in the House of Commons thesame afternoon.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat his first inclination had been to refrain fromany further announcement for the moment, lest thesusceptibilities of the United States Governmentshould be affected.    After reading the Statement,however, he was prepared to accept it.Two verbal amendments were made to the Statement,namely, the substitution of the term &quot;United States&quot;for &quot;America&quot;, and the addition of the words&quot;and India&quot; after &quot;Dominions&quot;, which at one point hadinadvertently been omitted.
The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs statedthat he had prepared a telegram informing the dominions of the proposed announcement, and as soon as theCabinet decision was taken he left the room for a few minutes in order to despatch it.In the course of the discussion the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer explained that the reasons for makingthe Government&apos;s policy quite clear at the present stage were, first, the importance of anticipatingany possible announcement by a foreign Governmentwhich might jeopardize the scheme;    second, the criticalfinancial conditions in Germany, who would in any event be likely to default in the payments due on July 15th;&apos;third, the stress laid by the American Secretary ofState on the importance of acceptance of the scheme as a whole;    and fourth, the desirability of announcing the concessions we were willing to make as an act ofspontaneous generosity rather than to have them draggedout of us by a series of appeals .   The Chancellor ofthe Exchequer made quite clear that the action proposedto be taken by the United Kingdom Government, includingthe offer to the Dominions and India of the same conces-sion as that proposed for foreign countries, was conditional on the general acceptance of president hoover&apos;s proposal.The Cabinet agreed  To approve the general policy set-forth in CP.-158 (31), as well asthe Statement to be made in Parlia-ment in the form attached to these conclusions.xNOTE..    Subsequently to the Meeting theChancellor of the Exchequer addeda few words to the Statement inorder to make this point unmistake-ably clear.

( C .?.-154 (51))  of the Cabinet Committee which hadVines Depart-Dent Organise.-      been appointed at the Meeting referred to in the.margin to consider the Memorandum by the Secretary(previous reference: for v&quot;ines  (CP.-145 (51)) dealing with the MinesCabinet 54(51), Con- Department Emergency Organisation.   Appended toelusion 5.)f.R. the Report was a Note by the Home Secretary coveringSUPPLY AND the Report of an Inter-Departmental ConferenceTRANSPORT   -COMMITTEE. - presided over by Sir John Anderson. ^he r ecommendatins(Previous of the Cabinet Committee were as follows:-Reference:Cabinet 56 (a) To accept the following recommend-(27), Con- ations contained in the Departmentalelusion 2.) Committee&apos;s Report:-(i) That the Secretary for mines should be authorised at once to take preliminary and confidential steps for obtaining from the coal ownersnominees to serve on DistrictCoal Emergency Committees.(ii)  That the Cabinet should appoint a standing Supply and Transport-Committee to supervise theemergency organisation andshould authorise the re-estab-lishment of the DepartmentalSub-Committee .(iii) That a Minister should beappointed now to act as ChiefCivil Commissioner.(iv) That the Secretary of State forScotland should be authorisedt o appoint forthwith the fiveDistrict Commissioners requiredfor the Scottish emergency organisation,(v) That Ministers concerned shouldbe authorised to take such steps as may be necessary and possible&quot;por overhauling the departmental organisation without involvingany risk of publicity.(b) To determine whether the Miners Pedera-tion, or any other Trade Unions concerned should be consulted at the present stageas to the nature of the emergency organ-Is at ion arrangements.
After the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,as Chairman of the Cabinet Committee on the coal situation, had made a statement on the course of theintricate negotiations which the Committee wasconducting, the Cabinet discussed the question of theemergency organisation.The Cabinet, though warned as to the dangers ofdelaying too long, were reluctant to act prematurely,and apprehensions were expressed as to the possible effect on the negotiations of taking steps to complete the emergency organisation.   One view was that theeffect on the mine-owners, at any rate, was likely tobe beneficial in stimulating a settlement.    There was general agreement that if action had to be taken,  therepresentatives both of the Mining Association andof the K&apos;iners&apos;  Federal ion should at once be informed-The Cabinet agreed  That the responsibility for decidingthat the moment had oo. .e to take the steps proposed in C.P.-154 (SI) witha view to putting in operation the mines Department Emergency organisation should rest,  in the first  instance, withthe Cabinet Committee on the coal situation, who should advise the PrimeMinister as to any action which.theydeemed necessary and desirable.   ThePrime Minister would then be in aposition to give the necessary authority.,

APPENDIX. 212As My Right hon Friend the Prime &apos; Minister informed the House on the 22nd instant, &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom subscribe wholeheartedly to the principleof President Hoover&apos;s proposal and are prepared to co-operate in the elaboration of details with a view to giving itpractical effect without delay&quot;: and with the permission ofthe House I should like to take this opportunity to explain the steps which we have decided to take for this purpose.The more consideration we give to the Presidentsdeclaration? the more it seems to us that having regardparticularly to the history of the matter, that declarationconstitutes a very great gesture on the part of the UnitedStates, and it will be a thousand pities if Europe does notrespond to it in the same spirit.    The beneficial effect of theproposal may be lost unless steps are taken by all thecountries concerned to give it prompt and practical effect.* This is particularly the case as regards Germany which,after all, is the essential difficulty. 7e agree with theview expressed by the United States Government that there isno time for a Conference. A more prompt method must be found for putting into operation the proposal of the United StatesGovernment for a complete and immediate suspension of Germanpayments to the Creditor Governments.The procedure which we would favour is that the principalCreditor Governments should forthwith notify the Bank for international Settlements that they agree to the proposal forthe suspension for one year of all the German payments due tothem.    The decision, of course, does not rest with us alone andwe are awaiting the views of the other Creditor Governments;but we hope that it may be possible to secure agreement onthese lines as soon as possible.(i)This paragraph Was amended after the Cabinet at the suggestion ofthe Foreign Office.
President HooTer&apos;s proposal applies, however, to&quot;all inter-governmental debts,  reparations and relief debts&quot;.His Majesty&apos;s Government for their part accept this proposal in the spirit as well as the letter.       They will accordingly be ready to suspend for one year all such inter-governmentalDebts due to them as soon as President Hoover&apos;s proposal has been generallyi accepted,  and in the meantime, as fromthe 1st proximo they will refrain from claiming instalmentsthat may fall due.      As regards the Relief debts, HisMajesty&apos;s Government are at once taking steps to inform theother European Governments which hold Relief Bonds of their action and to invite them to co-operate.Finally, although His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom do not regard President Hoover&apos;s proposal as directly affecting the War obligations of the Dominionsand of India to the United Kingdom, which are a matter fordiscussion and settlement between those of His Majesty&apos;governments concerned, we felt that we should be interpretingthe wishes of the country in deciding freely to offer to theDominions and India the same concession as is proposed forforeign countries under the same conditions.*Accordingly, when inviting the assent of theDominion Governments and the Government of India to the suspension of the German payments so far as regards the share to which they are entitled, we intimated that,  on thesame principle, we would readily give them the option of postponing the whole amount of their War Debt payments to theUnited Kingdom for the period of twelve months from the 1stJuly, 1931, if they so. desire.(ii)*   Words added after the Cabinet Meeting.
These proposals will involve a loss to the currentBudget which may reach approximately  11 millions-     Thisis a serious sacrifice for the taxpayers of this countryupon whom such heavy calls have already been made, but we hope that the step which we are faking in co-operation withthe United States will be more than justified by the helpit will give in &quot;reviving confidence and prosperity.(iii)
