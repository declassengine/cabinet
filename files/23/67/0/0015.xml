The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that he would be available at any time to returnto London from Scotland in case of urgent necessityduring the Recess.   He warned the Cabinet thatthere might be emergencies to be dealt with.The Cabinet agreed  That every member should notify his address to the Secretary to theCabinet and keep the Cabinet Officeinformed of any change of address.(NOTE:    Later in the Cabinet Meeting theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs mentioned that the onlydate on which he could.be present at the Cabinet after he left for the meetings of the Counciland Assembly at Geneva would beOctober 1st.

gglA. 2. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that a difficult situation might arise in connection with the Russian debtjviousTerence: negotiations.   Great difficulties had been encounteredjbinet 44SO), Con&quot; in makmg any progress with the Soviet Delegation,lysion 3.)He himself had seen the Russian Soviet Ambassador onthe subject.   The Ambassador now said that he was ina position to make an offer but -was apprehensive thatthe Government of the United Kingdom would reject it,not on account of the offer itself, but of the condi-tions accompanying the offer.   He had first suggestedthat these conditions would include a loan, or long-term credits from the United Kingdom, but on theForeign Secretary rejecting the idea of a loan asout of the question he had fallen back on long-termcredits.   The Ambassador insisted that before commu-nicating his offer he must have an undertaking thatit would not be rejected owing to its being accompaniedby a request for long-term credits.   The Secretary ofState had pressed the Ambassador to state what theoffer was, and had told him that he himself would then have to consider whether he could recommend LordGoschen to continue the negotiations on that basis.He had said that he would not himself reject the accompanying conditionsoffer^without consulting the Cabinet.   He had evenmentioned the possibility of putting the responsibiliiyof rejection on the House of Commons.   Nevertheless,the Ambassador had refused to communicate tlie offerwithout the undertaking mentioned above.The Cabinet agreed -That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should make quite clear that hecould not negotiate in the dark, andmust know from the Soviet Ambassadorexactly what he was dealing with.
3. The Cabinet had before them the text of thePress Communique issued after the final meeting ofthe London Conference, July 1931 (CP.-187 (31)).The Prime Minister said that further actiondepended on two Reports, one from the Experts nowin Berlin, to be addressed to the German Chancellor;and the other from the Committee of the Bank for international Settlements, which would be communi-cated to the Governments represented at the Confer-ence.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointedout the importance of keeping in mind the situation that would arise at the end of the year&apos;s suspension of debt payments provided for by the Hoover proposal.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To leave the question to be dealtwith by the Prime Minister, theChancellor of the Exchequer andthe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs according as the situation might develop:(b) That any member of the Cabinet whoso desired should be sent a copy ofthe Minutes of the Meetings of theLondon Conference, July 1931.(MOTE BY ^HE SECRETARY; The following membersof the Cabinet have intimated their desire to receive copies:-The Lord President of the Council,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The Secretary of State for the Colonies,The Secretary of State for War,The First Lord of the A^dmiralty,The Minister of Health,The Secretary of State for Scotland.The copies will be sent as soon asprints are available, but a shortdelay may be unavoidable as eorrec-tions from some of the foreignDelegates are still outstanding.)

LrshANv-nmiAm SERVICEIefween b^srah0 7ARAGKI.Tareatened/interruptionhi.[(previous reference:cabinet 35(28), Con-elusion 2.)5. Tlie Cabinet had before them Memoranda by theSecretary of State for Air (CP.-183 (31)) and theand CP.-196(51))Secretary of State for India (CP.-192 (31)/ on thesubject of the difficult situation which had arisenvis-a-vis Persia in connection with the commercialair service to India.   This service is at presentoperated along the northern (or eastern) shore ofthe Persian Gulf and halts en route at three points in Persian territory, viz.,Bushire, Lingah and Jask.The grant of facilities for the further operation ofthis route runs out in eight months&apos; time, i.e.,atthe1 end of March, 1932, and the Persian Governmenthas refused to renew permission to operate this route.The alternative route through Central Persia, proposedby the Persian Government, has been reported by Imperial 1Airways as impracticable for technical reasons.   Theonly other route lies along the Arabian coast of theGulf and is for the most part barren, inhospitableand uncivilised, with a climate hotter in summer thanon the Persian side, and with a lack of facilities and amenities for civilian passengers .   The proposals ofthe Secretary of State for Air were that imperial airways should approach the Persian Government forth-with as a matter of ordinary commercial negotiation,for which purpose Sir John Cadman had offered the good offices of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company;    also that allpreliminary action should be taken for the organisationof the Arabian coast route   a course advocated by our Minister at Teheran and the Foreign Office since junly 1930   despite its admitted drawbacks .The Secretary of State for India emphasised the strong political objections of the Indian Governmentto the organisation of a commercial air route on the-5-
Arabian side of the Gulf.   While recognising that inthe last resort, if no progress could be made with Persia, we might be forced to adopt that route, hewas not satisfied that we hs $ yet reached that point.He recommended that Imperial Airways should be askedto consider the possibility of flying via Baghdad-Kermanshah-Ispahan and thence south-east to Gwattar,or, alternatively, Baghdad-Kermanshah-Teheran-Ispahan-Gwattar&quot;    that the Persians should be told that thepractical difficulties of the route they had proposed are insuperable, and should be asked to allow analternative route and to give facilities for the investigation of the route Ispahan-Gwattar by a repre-sentative of Imperial Airways, accompanied, if desired,by a representative of the Persian Air Ministry;    thatif the Persian Government refused to consider any alternative route, across Central Persia, or if these routes proved impracticable after reconnaissance,they should again be pressed officially to renew ourpermission to fly along the Gulf route;    and that inthe meantime discussion should be initiated betweenthe Air Ministry, the India Office and other interested departments as to the organisation of the Arab route,such discussions to be without prejudice to the generalque s t ion involving e d .In his second Memorandum (CP.-196 (31)) theSecretary of State for India circulated a copy of atelegram received from the Government of India.    In ,this telegram the Government of India emphasised theclimatic and political objections to the developmentof the southern route and expressed the view thatpersuasive methods in the short interval duringwhich the Airways concession in Persia remainedoperative were foredoomed to failure;    and that if-6-
the attempt were pressed with undue insistenceHis Majesty&apos;s Government world find themselves com-pelled to have recourse to force both for the inceptionand maintenance of the route .   They wished it to be clearly understood that in that event they could not undertake the protection of the Airways establishment at Ras-a1-Khaimah or elsewhere on the Trucial Coastwith Indian forces.   They made the suggestion thatthe Trucial island of Abu Musa, which is the propertyof the Sheikh of Shargah, might be considered in preference to Ras-al-Ehaimah on the mainland.   TheSecretary of State considered this latter suggestionworth exploring, although he warned the Cabinet thatthere was in existence an unjustified Persian claimto sovereignty over Abu Musa, - a claim which we had never recognised.The Cabinet were reminded that, owing to theunresponsive attitude of the Persian Government inthe negotiations for a settlement of outstanding questions, the Duzdab Railway (connecting India withthe border of Persia) had been closed and the PersianGovernment were anxious that it should be reopened.It was suggested that the reopening of this railwaymight be used as a lever to obtain a concession fromthe Persian Government for continuance of the air route along the northern (or eastern) side of thePersian Gulf.The Secretary of State for Air, while concurringin this proposal, was anxious, during the progress ofthe negotiations, to continue (without incurringexpenditure) to take up the possibilities of theorganisation of the southern route.The Secretary of State for India entered a caveatas to the serious political considerations involved.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggestedthat this was essentially a matter for inter-Depart-mental consultation.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should reopennegotiations with the PersianGovernment with a view to anextension of the route along thenorthern (or eastern) side of theGulf, using as a lever the possiblereopening of the Duzdab Railway.
Unisation%hb indianreference:*5binet 64(27), Con-fusion ^. ;6.The Cabinet had before them a Report by theDefence of India Sub-Committee of the Committee ofImperial Defence (C.P.-179 (31)) on the Indianisationof the Indian Army, covering a Note by the Secretaryof State for India on the Government of India&apos;s pro-posals of A-pril 6, 1931, which were also circulated.The proposals, which represent the considered opinion of the Government of India, based on therecommendation of the Commander-in-Chief, are to theeffect that the field of Indianisation should beextended to embrace the components of a completeIndianised War Division, with its full complement of artillery (two brigades of field artillery and onebrigade of mountain artillery), engineers (sappersand miners), pioneers and signals, as well as a cavalrybrigade with a battery of horse artillery, togetherwith the necessary complement of staff and ancillary services .    In addition, it was proposed to includetwo armoured car companies in the scheme.The Army Council did not feel in a position todisagree with the general principles of the schemedrawn up by the authorities on the spot, who, with thefull weight of responsibility, are endeavouring tocarry out what is understood to be the consideredpolicy of His Majesty!s Government.   The Sub-Committeeendorsed this view, but considered it their duty todraw the attention of the Committee to the followingfour questions, and especially to the important impli-cation involved by the temporary reduction in theefficiency of our Forces in India:-1. The arming of units.2. Possible difficulties of mixed personnel in units.3. The effect on War Office commitments and requirements of any temporary lossof efficiency due to the change.4. The establishment of&apos; an Indian Sandhurst.-9-
997j iIn view of the fact that the Government of Indiaand the Commander-in-Chief personally are prepared totake such measures of risk as may be entailed by theseproposals, the Sub-Committee recommended that, subjectto endorsement by His Majesty&apos;s Government of thematters of political principle involved, general approval should be given to the Government of India&apos;scheme, and, in particular,  (a) to the proposal thatthe field of Indianisation during the next stage of expansion should consist of the components of acomplete Indianised War Division, with its full eom-complement of artillery, engineers, pioneers and signals,as well as a cavalry brigade with a battery of horseartillery, together with provision for staff, depart-mental and ancillary appointments, and also for twoarmoured car companies;    (b) to the proposal thatthe annual intake into the new Indian Military Collegeshould, be fixed at 60 .After a statement by the Secretary of State forWar and discussion on the four important points mentioned in paragraph 4 of C.P.-179 (31), theCabinet agreed  (a) To approve in principle that the field of Indianisation should be extended toembrace the components of a completeIndianised War Division, as set forth in paragraph 2 of CP.-179 (31), *subject to -(b) Consultation between the Secretary ofState for War and the Secretary of Statefor India on the four questions referredto in Paragraph 4 of CP.-179 (31):(c) That the Secretary of State for india should take steps to ensure that thegeneral lines of the above decisionare communicated to the Commander-in-Chief in India.
ft CONSTITU-M&amp;Jj POSITION&quot;&quot;&quot;  - SOUTHIMS.previous reference:rabinet 21(31)   Con-conclusion 16.)7 . The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum, bythe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (CP.-177(31)) giving full particulars of a difficult position which had arisen in Newr South Wales owing to a constitutional dispute between the Governor (Sir Pn.il i;;Game) and his Premier (Mr Lang) .   In a telegram dated july 4th the Premier of the State had proposed thatthe Secretary of State should &quot;request the Governor&quot;of New South Wales to act on the advice of his&quot;Ministers and in particular to act on the repeated&quot;advice of Ministers to appoint a sufficient number&quot;of new members to the Legislative Council to ensure&quot;the prompt passage through that body of Government&quot;measures&quot;.   As the result of a careful examinationof the question, including all precedents and eonsult-ation with the Law Officers, the Secretary of state had arrived at the conclusion that the Governor ofthe State had undoubtedly a discretion in the exerciseof the Constitutional powers vested in him as therepresentative of His Majesty.    In the circumstancesof the present case, which arose in relation to theinternal affairs of New South Wales, he was notprepared to advise His Majesty to issue any instruc-tions to the Governor as to the manner in which thatdiscretion should be exercised.The Secretary of State attached to his Memoranduma draft of a letter to the Agent-General of New SouthWales, in which the Attorney-General and Solicitor-General had concurred, setting out his attitude as summarised above.   As discussions were still proceed-ing between the Governor and Mr Lang with a view toa settlement of the difficulty - the. Secretary ofState did not propose to send the letter unless anduntil satisfied that no further progress could bemade locally without it.-11-
The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs stated that the situation was changing from day today and he did not know at the moment whether itwould be necessary for him to send the letter in annex V. to CP.-177 (31) or not.   His intention was to hold it up as long as &quot;possible.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs as set forth in cp.-177 (31) and summarised above.-IS-

IkADS position[^AFFECTED BY[/previous Reference:Cabinet 39Con-clusion 1; .11 .      The President of the Board of Trade reportedthat apprehensions had been expressed lest owing tothe serious economic situation in Germany thatcountry and other countries affected, all of whichwere very short of cash and credits, might attemptto unload goods on this country and in Scandinavia and lels ewhere/ at non-competitive prices.     He had done bis best toascertain the position by telegram but his informa-tion was rather vague.     He thought that there wasgreatno/danger so far as coal was concerned, as coal exports were regulated by the German Coal Syndicate.There were, however, accumulations of certain othermanufactured goods and raw materials which mightbe unloaded.      He was unable to recommend any action by this country, as this was impossible without legislation.      It was impossible  to discriminateowing to the existence of Commercial Treaties.      any action was dangerous and likely to provokeretaliation.The Prime Minister said that during his visit to Berlin he had met a certain number of Germanbusiness men and had warned them against this line which would not pay them in the end.      nevertheless he heard that there were complaints in Scotland of barley and oats and other cereals being dumped.The Cabinet were reminded of certainmemoranda that had been prepared on this question for the Trade Survey Committee.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary should circulate for the information of the Cabinetcopies of the Memoranda prepared bythe President of the Board of trade for the Trade Survey Committee, ondumping and commercial treaties.

In generalthe decision of the Committee was extremely favourable to the Bill.   He hoped to report verbally to theCabinet whether the Committee would finish its laboursbefore the Recess.The Minister of Transport reported thatthe Joint Committee was likely to finish its work the same day, or in any event before the recess.      If necessary the Chairman would obtain a resolution from the House of Commons to complete the inquiry during the Recess.     He hoped to haveeverything ready for legislation on there-assembly of Parliament.The Cabinet took note of the above.

The letter concluded by asking formallyfor an undertaking from the Government on this point.The Minister sought the formal approval of tile Cabinetto despatch a letter to the London County Council onthe following lines:-(a) Remind the Council that at the time when their previous Charing Cross Bridge bill was rejected by the Select Committee ofthe House they were informed that theGovernment would be prepared to support them if they decided to move the re-committal of the Bill.(b) When the Council decided on the alterna-tive coitrse of appointing an AdvisoryCommittee to recommend &quot;an agreed scheme&quot;for a new road bridge at Charing Crossthey were informed that in view of thelarge traffic and financial considerations involved, the Minister must be free toconsider any scheme recommended by theAdvisory Committee on its merits and toexamine it from the financial aspect,taking into account the position of theRoad Fund at that time.(c) The scheme now recommended by the Advisory-  Committee is not an &quot;agreed scheme&quot;, andis still, in fact, the subject of acutecontroversy.(d) Future events, such as a rapid development in the electrification of main line rail-ways, may profoundly affect the considera-tions which would determine the lay-outon the south side of the river.
(e) The Council are aware that the resourcesof the Road Fund are insufficient to meetthe heavy commitments undertaken in con-nection with schemes for the improvement and construction of roads and bridges inall parts of the country, and that powers have accordingly been taken in this year&apos;sFinance Bill for advances to be made tothe Fund from the Exchequer up to a sumnot exceeding  9,000,000 to meet theexpenditure falling due during the current financial year.(f) The Government have carefully reviewed theposition, and in view of all the circumstances-stances, including the present serious economic situation, they regret that theyare unable at the present time to renew the offer of a 75 per cent, grant from theRoad Fund towards the cost of a new roadbridge at Charing Cross .The Minister of Transport reminded theCabinet that the London County Council would now demolish Waterloo Bridge.     Any grant madefor the new bridgeby the Government/would be limited to thenormal scale.The Cabinet approved the general lines of the letter which theMinister of Transport proposed tosend to the London County council as set forth in CP. 189 (;51).
-TRIPICATIONRAILWAYS .evi ousference:binet 381), Con-conclusion b) .14.     The Prime Minister said that it was important as far as possible to avoid giving any impression that the Government were seriously considering the electrification ofthe railways, as this would have a bad effecton the national financial position whichhad now become the supreme question before theGovernment.      In these circumstances it wouldbe better for the Government not to publish the letter on the subject from the RailwayCompanies.The Minister of Transport warned theCabinet that the letter might leak out fromother sources.The Cabinet agreed  That the Minister of transport should not publish the letterfrom the Railway Companies onthe subject of the Electrificationof Railways.

Particulars were given of a very fewapplications and enquiries to the Railway Companies.In order to bring the position again before tradersand to emphasise the nature of the grants available and the expenditure which would rank for grant,  theMinister reported that he had recently had prepared and circulated to the Railway Companies and theprincipal Industrial Associations concerned an explanatory statement, a copy of which was attachedto his Memorandum.The Cabinet took note of the above memorandum (CP. 193 0*1)).
16.    The President of the Board of Trade saidthat,  owing to the preoccupations of the governor of the Bank of England it had not been possibleto pursue with him the question of there-organisation of the Iron and Steel Trade.He hoped, however, to take the matter up duringthe Recess.      a move was being made in one ortwo of the districts affected.The Prime Minister said that during his visit to Berlin he had repeatedly been informedthat Germany was suffering from over-rationalisation.The subject was continued on theAgenda Paper.
the EDUCATIONAL 1/. The Cabinet- had before them a Memorandum byENDOWMENT S(SCOTLAND) the Secretary of State for Scotland (H.A.-S9 (31))COMMISSION.reporting that, in accordance with the terms of(Previous Section 40 of the Educational Endowments (Scotland)Reference:Cabinet 63 Act, 1928, the powers of the Commissioners appointed(SO), Con-clusion 7.) under that Act shall not, unless continued by  ^. Parliament, be exercised by them after December 31,5^(^11. 1931.    The task of the Commissioners would not becompleted by that date, and he was satisfied that anextension of their powers until December 31, 1934,was necessary.    This extension could not be obtained by means of the Expiring Laws Continuance Act, as asmall additional charge would fall upon the exchequer by reason of the extension.   He therefore attached adraft Bill to extend the duration of the powers ofthe Commissioners, and recommended that the Bill,which would not be controversial, should be intro-duced at the earliest possible opportunity and passed into law before the end of the year.   The treasury had concurred in the terms of the Bill, and theScottish Universities Committee of the Privy council had also agreed.The Cabinet authorised theSecretary of State for scotland to proceed   with his Bill, onthe understanding that no guarantee of Parliamentary time could begiven.

Appendix.O.P. 195 (31).THE DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE.The Three Party Resolutions.THE Conclusions of the final meeting of the Sub-Committee on theDisarmament Conference (Three Party Committee), together with the resolutions which have been unanimously adopted by this Sub-Committee, are circulated for the information of the Cabinet by direction of the Prime Minister.(Signed) M. P. A. HANKEY,Secretary to the Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. I,July 27, 1931.ENCLOSURE.&quot; Conclusions.It was agreed (a) To adjourn the Three-Party Sub-Committee on the understandingthat if and when further matters of principle arose on which itmight be desirable to take the opinions of the Committee it shouldbe re-assembled.(b) That arising out of the discussions of the Committee there were anumber of matters which would have to be examined in detailfrom a practical point of view; the responsibility for the conductof such examinations was a matter for the Government.(c) That the Prime Minister should reserve for later determination thequestion of the composition of the delegation.(d) That the resolutions* to which the Committee had agreed, and the papers which had been circulated should be regarded as entirelyconfidential.&apos;&apos;[D.C. (P.) 50.]Resolutions adopted at the Tenth Meeting held on Wednesday, Jidy 15, 1931.IT is. suggested that the aim of the United Kingdom Delegation at theConference on Disarmament should be to carry out the principles set forth below.The occasion and method of their presentation, whether before or during theConference, whether at Plenary Meetings or in Committee, whether afterpreparatory conversations and soundings, or otherwise, are matters to be decided[5783]* Attached hereto.
by the Government and the Delegates with due regard to all the circumstances ofthe moment.1. The Delegates should base their policy on the recognition by all states members of the League of Nations, emphasised in the case of those that areparties to the Treaty of Versailles and the Final Protocol of the LocarnoConference, that the maintenance of peace requires the reduction of nationalarmaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety and the enforce-ment by common action of international obligations.* They should, at the stagethey deem appropriate, declare our readiness to fulfil our Treaty commitments and insist that they constitute an obligation of honour for all the signatories ofthese Treaties.2. The Delegates should make a full statement of the reductions alreadyeffected by the United Kingdom, and state that any further reductions by us mustbe part of an international agreement. The Delegates will bear in mind, also,that the possibility of keeping our armaments at their present low level may haveto be reconsidered unless there are comparable reductions by other Powers.3. In considering the armaments of particular nations, the aim should be areduction of armaments to such a point as will ensure for all nations a reasonablesecurity. To reach this objective, successive Conferences should be held at intervals, at each of which a further stage in the reduction of armaments wouldbe reached. The military forces of nations, whether personnel or material,available on the outbreak of war, should be limited in such a way as to make it unlikely for an aggressor to succeed with a knock-out blow. By this means anopportunity would be given for the various methods of conciliation andpacification to be brought into play.4. In determining the limit to be fixed for any country, account must betaken of its circumstances political, geographical and international. In thefirst stage of what is intended to be a progressive policy of international disarma-ment it is necessary to take into account considerations of security and the bearingthereon of recent history. Allowance, for example, should be made for thecircumstances of a nation like France, which has been twice invaded and oncedevastated within living memory, and is naturally suffering apprehensions forits security which cannot be allayed in a short time. It is no less important thatGermany should be given security against invasion by her neighbours, who,collectively, are at present in a position to overwhelm her.5. The principle of combining security with limitation of offensive powerraises two aspects of disarmament, namely, (a) its total amount, e.g., total sea,land and air forces; (b) the specific character of the armaments, including range and destructive capacity.6. The most successful methods of disarmament that have as yet been evolved are those adopted in the Disarmament Clauses of the Peace Treaties,which require to be supplemented by some form of budgetary limitation. the delegates should aim at the application mutatis mutandis of similar principles to the general reduction and limitation of armaments, and should support theprinciple that the same methods of Disarmament should be applied to all nationsalike. This should not involve the increase of the fighting strength of thedisarmed Powers, but rather the reduction of the armaments of others. the elimination or limitation, as the case may be, of weapons as provided in the peace treaties is important and should be pressed by our Delegates as generallyapplicable. The system of supervision accepted in the Disarmament Treaty,which should be on some such lines as those proposed in the Draft Convention,should replace the methods of supervision in the Peace Treaties.7. The Delegates should reaffirm our desire to see conscription abolished.If, as is probable, its abolition should prove impossible, other methods must befound for the limitation of effective strengths of land and air personnel, andconsequently of their reserves.8.   Full information as to reserves of men and material should be published.* Particulars of the Various Declarations are attached in the Annex.
Annex.T. Article 8 of the Covenant.&apos;&apos; The Members of the League recognise that the maintenance of peacerequires a reduction of national armaments to the lowest point consistent with national safety and the enforcement by common action of international obligations.The Council, taking account of the geographical situation and the circumstances-stances of each State, shall formulate plans of such reduction for consideration and action by the several Governments.&quot;2. The Treaty of Versailles, Part V.&apos;&apos; In order to render possible the initiation of a general limitation ofarmaments of all nations, Germany undertakes strictly to observe the Military,Naval and Air Clauses which follow.&quot;3. The Section of the Reply of the Allied and Associated Powers to the Observa-tions of the German Delegation on the Conditions of Peace, dated june 16, 1919.&apos;&apos; The Allied and Associated Powers wish to make it clear that their require-ments in regard to German armaments were not made solely with the object ofrendering it impossible for Germany to resume her policy of military aggression.They are also the first steps towards that general reduction and limitation ofarmaments which they seek to bring about as one of the most fruitfulpreventives of war, and which it would be one of the first duties of the Leagueof Nations to promote.&quot;4. The Final Protocol of the Locarno Conference, October 16, 1925.&quot; The representatives of the Governments represented here declare their firmconviction that the entry into force of these Treaties and Conventions will contribute greatly to bring about a moral relaxation of the tensions between nations, that it will help powerfully towards the solution of many political or economic problems in accordance with the interests and sentiments of peoples,and that, in strengthening peace and security in Europe, it will hasten oneffectively the disarmament provided for in Article 8 of the Covenant of theLeague of Nations.They undertake to give their sincere co-operation to the work relating to disarmament already undertaken by the League of Nations and to seek the realisation thereof in a general agreement.&quot;9.   The Delegates should keep in view throughout the idea of gradually1 leading nations to rely for their security on the obligations undertaken by all theI nations of the Conference to renounce war as an instrument of policy and to seek1 the settlement of disputes by none but peaceful means.   Until these engagementsare accepted at their face value disarmament can never be complete.2, Whitehall Gardens, S. W. 1,July 16, 1931.
