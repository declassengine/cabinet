The Prime Minister made a statement to theCabinet  on the Parliamentary Programme, on thefollowing assumptions:-   Adjournment, July 31st;Re-assembly, October 20th;    Prorogation, November6th? Opening o^ new Session, November 24th.A copy of the draft Programme on which he made his statement is attached in the Appendix.   He pointedout that if the Adjournment took place on July 31stthere would be left over the following Bills:-TOW AND COUNTRY PLANNING,REPRESENTATION OP THE PEOPLE^LONDON PASSENGER TRANSPORT,35(31)8. F.ft.ii-(^f0 DESTRUCTIVE FOREIGN ANIMALS,for which provision would be made between Ootober2-0th and November 6th.THE AGRICULTURAL LAND (UTILISATION) BILL,  itwas suggested, might be dealt with before the adjournment at an all-night sitting.No provision had been made for the following bills :-HOURS CF INDUSTRIAL EMPLOYMENT,MERCHANT SHIPPING  (SAFETY CONVENTION),TOISON AND PHARMACY,PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT (SUNDAY PERFORMANCES),CONSUMERS&apos;  COUNCIL,32(31)1528(31)6 .27(31)10.65(30)21 .18(31)2.27 I 31)16 .71(30)11.   f.R.BRITISH MUSEUM AND NATIONAL GALLERY(OVERSEAS LOAN).The President of the Board of Trade insistedHE MERCHANTSHIPPING  ( SAFETYONVENTION) BILL,   that the Merchant Shipping (Safety Convention) bill previous reference:Cabinet 87(Si), Con-olusfon 10.)could not be dropped.    Its object was to ratify anInternational Agreement on Safety of Life at Sea,Load-lines, and such matters.   The Bill had passed the House of Lords and was not likely to be highly controversial.
asURS opINDUSTRIALgkPI^YMENTBILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 28(31) , 0 on-clusion 6.)THE STATUTE OPWESTMINSTER.(previous reference:Cabinet 60(30), Con-clusion 6.)It was pointed out that the ^rm^rnment werepledged over the Hours of Industrial employment bill.The Prime Minister said it was proposed that itshould be taken as the first important measure inthe new Session of Parliament.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs reported that it was essential to pass the statute of Westminster Bill before December.Discussion was concentrated mainly on the dateof re-assembly after the Adjournment and on thequestion of whether it would not be wiser in thepresent year to revert to the old plan of prolonging the Session until the Christmas Vacation, insteadof opening a new Session before Christmas ,    Infavour of the former course it was suggested thatpolitically it would be better to complete thework of the present Session and to open the new parliament with a fresh instalment of the G-overn-menfs programme rather than to re-introduce the bills which it had not been found possible to passin the present Session.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To proceed on the assumption that parliament would adjourn on July31st:(b) To postpone the following questionsuntil their next Meeting:-(i) The date of re-assemblyof Parliament:(ii) The question of prolonging the present Session untilthe Christmas Vacation:($) That the Merchant Shipping (SafetyConvention) Bill must be passed beforeProrogation.(The. Prime.Minister, who was -slightly indisposed,j^ft&quot;at this point.)
So   The Pir3t Lord of the Admiralty, as theMinister in charge of the Consumers&apos;  Council Billin Committee, reported the circumstances in whichClause 3 of the Bill, which deals with the powersof the Council to obtain information, had beendeleted on the previous day..After a short discussion the Cabinet agreed  That Clause 3 should be re-insertedon the Report Stage of the Bill,
3.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP.-169 (31))on the subject of the Franco-American agreement about the Hoover Plan.As the Memorandum had only been circulated late on the previous evening, the Chancellor of theExchequer gave the Cabinet a detailed commentaryon the Agreement, in the course of which he emphasised the difficulties to this country arisingout of the points left over for settlement.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that on the previous day hehad suggested that a point had now been reachedwhen a Conference should immediately be assembledin London in accordance with the invitation issuedas the result of the Cabinet Conclusion referredto in the margin.   He had suggested that, in thefirst instance, an Expert Conference shouldassemble on Monday, July 13th, to be followed bya meeting of Ministers a week later, so as not tointerfere with the Paris and Berlin visits.   Heread, a reply which he had just received from theFrench Government (telegram   No .155 from the british ambassador, Paris) accepting the British suggestion in principle, but proposing that the Experts should meet on July 17th, and that the date of themeeting of the Conference of Ministers should depend on the progress made by the Experts *The Chancellor of the Exchequer emphasised thatif the Conference of Experts was to be postponed until July 17th we ought to insist that the FrenchGovernment should follow our. own example andintimate that they would not claim their share
of the payments due by Germany on July 15thwhich were to be postponed under the terms of theHoover proposal.    He agreed that the date of thePolitical Conference should depend upon the pro-gress made by the Experts..   He also agreed with aproposal by the French Government that the Confer-ence of Experts should be restricted to British,Belgian, French,  Italian, Japanese, German, and,if possible, American representatives.The Cabinet agreed  To approve that the meeting of experts should be arranged for july 17th, and that all matters relating to that meeting and any subsequent Conference of ministers should be left to the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs,  inconsultation with the Prime Minister,and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

THE IRON ANDSTEEL TRADE.(previous reference:Cabinet 36(31), Con-clusion 6.)F.R.5.    The question of the re-organisation of theIron and Steel Trade was continued on the agenda paper of the Cabinet.
6. Owing to a decision yesterday by the LondonCounty Council to reconstitute the Charing CrossAdvisory Committee for the purpose of examiningfurther the proposals upon which Scheme No.4 was based, and the absence of the Prime Minister, theCabinet postponed consideration of the Memorandumby the Minister of Transport (C.P.-165 (31)) onthe subject of the Charing Cross Bridge Scheme.
