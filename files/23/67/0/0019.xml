national expenditure,(PreviousReferenceCabinet43 (31)conclusion H).F.R.With reference to the conclusion referred to in the margin, the Prime Ministerreported to the Cabinet that the financial situation had undergone further deteriorationandon the previous day. The Chancellor of the Exchequer/himself had met the Representatives of the Bankof England and the Leaders of the opposition parties on the previous afternoon, and had foundthat it was absolutely impossible to reach any agreement on the proposals which the Cabinet had authorised him to lay before those persons.With regard to the Representatives of theBank of England, the position was that it was essential that assistance of a substantialcharacter must be obtained both from New York and paris.      In connection with the former, theFederal Reserve Bank had, on their own initiative,issued a very reassuring statement as to theGovernments intentions, while the Bank of france had also been responsible for a very favourablenotice in the Paris Press.     He assured theCabinet in the most emphatic terms that there wasno ground whatever for the suggestion that thepresent crisis was in any respect due to aconspiracy on the part of the Banks, all of whichwere most anxious to render assistance to theGovernment.
2.With regard to the proposals as determined on the previous day by the Cabinet, the Represent-atives of the Bank of England had made it quite clear that, if the economies suggested represented the Government1s final word, the scheme would be ofno value.     They pointed out that an analysis of thefigures showed that against the total deficit, realsavings in expenditure only amounted to about 48 millions.     The other so-called economies were merely additional burdens which, while they wouldease the Exchequer position, really involved furthertaxation of the employer and the workman.     Itcould not be too clearly recognised that foreignlenders regarded the heavy financial burdens on industry of the Unemployment Insurance scheme asimpairing the security for their loans.     In the considered opinion of the Bankers, the proposals would not only not produce the required effect, but would probably worsen the position by furtherdiminishing confidence.At the subsequent meeting with the Represent-atives of the Leaders of the two Parties, all those Leaders had made it quite clear that the pro-posals were wholly unsatisfactory, and that none ofthem would give them any support.     They had suggested that in the circumstances parliament should be summoned with the least possible delay,and had made it clear that directly the House ofCommons met, the two Parties would combine to defeat the Government.     In the meantime the
crisis would have happened, as the present financial resources would he exhausted within the next fewdays.     The Party Leaders had made it clear that ifthe crisis occurred, the sole responsibility must rest with the Government, and in the most correctpossible fashion they had suggested that HisMajesty should be consulted.     Later in the evening the Prime Minister had again seen theParty Leaders,who    in the meantime had consultedwith prominent members of their own Parties, all of whom had completely associated themselves withthe views expressed by the Party Leaders earlier in the day.      In particular, at a separate meeting with the Liberals, the Prime Minister had been assured that it was impossible for the liberal party to support the Government in this matter.All the Party Leaders looked for economies which in the aggregate would be substantially greater than the figure of  56 millions proposed.They urged, however, that the real weakness ofthe proposals was the failure to secure adequateeconomies on Unemployment Insurance.In conclusion the Prime Minister statedthat he had informed the Party Leaders that afurther meeting of the Cabinet was to he called,and that they would receive the final decision ofthe Government at midday to-day.In reply to a question relative to the sinking Fund proposal,  the CHANCELLOR OF THEEXCHEQUER informed the Cabinet that the Leaders
of the Conservative Party, and also the Represent-atives of the Bankers, had stated that any attemptof this kind to camouflage the true position wouldhe at once detected, and that it was of paramount importance that the Budget should he balanced in anhonest fashion, and not by recourse to borrowing.The Cabinet took note of theReport summarised above of the meetings held on the previous afternoon.
xtIS POLITICALSITUATION.2. Arising out of the Report   made tothe Cabinet summarised in the previousConclusion, the Cabinet discussed at considerable length the procedure to beadopted in the immediate future in theevent of certain contingencies arising.THE financial situation ANDTHE INTER-PARTYDISCUSSIONS.It   &apos; A v -       /^^-^/J (&amp;//3. In the course of discussion theChancellor of the Exchequer reminded theCabinet of the very difficult position inwhich the Members of the Government wouldbe placed in the House of Commons if a new government took Office and introduced economylegislation based on the existing proposals with the addition of further substantialcuts in Unemployment Insurance.At the opening discussions withthe Leaders of the political parties, economies of the order of nearly  84 millions had beenenvisaged but these economies had now been greatly reduced by decisions with whichhe personally was not in agreement.    Inhis, the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s,view the first question for decision was whether the Cabinet would now review theirfindings of the previous day and add afurther  25 - 30 millions of economies tothe present figure of  56 millions gross.It was a delusion to imagine that any large economy could be secured from &quot;derating&quot;and, in any event, this was merely a transfer
from taxes to rates and did not touch the rootof the problem, which from the international financial point of view could only be rectifiedby drastic treatment of the Unemployment Insurancefigures.There could be no possible question that,of the reasons for the present crisis, much themost serious was the huge and rapidly growingexpenditure on Unemployment Insurance which must inevitably be dealt with by either the present or some future Government.     &quot;When it was announced that after taking account of economies of the order suggested by the Leaders of theOpposition Parties there would still be a deficit ofsome  90 millions to be covered by new taxation,the shock to public confidence would be veryacute.The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet of the nature of the consequences whichwould follow from^i departure from the goldstandard.     So far as he was concerned^ he had nodoubt whatever, if he was compelled to choose between retaining the Labour Movement in itspresent form and reducing the standard of living of the workmen by 50$, which would be the effectof departing from the gold standard, where his duty woifflld lie;    and he felt confident that his views would be shared by every responsibleLeader of the Party.   After explaining the present currency position the Chancellor
outlined the appalling consequences to trade andindustry and to all engaged therein of a collapse of sterling.   The position could only he rectifiedby resolute facing of this Unemployment Insurancequestion.    After some further discussion the PrimeMinister invited the Cabinet to say whether theywere prepared to authorise him to inform the Leadersof the Opposition Parties that the Government wereprepared to add a further  20 millions gross totheir list of economies, to be made up as to - 12i millions by a 10 per cent, reduction in umemployment Insurance benefit, and as to 7f millions in other ways.   The Cabinet werenot prepared to authorise the Prime Minister tomake this offer.The Chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs asked thattheir dissentfromthis conclusion should be recorded.After further discussion, in the course ofwhich the Prime Minister referred to the great difficulties which would arise if the Cabinetdeclined to make any advance at all on the economiesas determined on the previous day, the cabinet agreed -To authorise the Prime Minister andthe Chancellor of&quot; the Exchequer toascertain from the Leaders of theOpposition Parties whether they would regard as satisfactory the addition ofa further  20 millions&quot; gross to the listof economies, to be made up as to  13^millions by a 10 per cent, reduction in umemployment Insurance benefit,    and asto  17% millions in other ways:    it being distinctly understood, however,that, in making this inquiry, they were merely seeking information, and that theGovernment were in no way committed tothe proposal.
After some further discussion of possible courses of procedure which might he followed in thenext few days, the Cabinet agreed -(l)    To adjourn so as to enable the Prime Ministerand the Chancellor of the Exchequer to confer with the Leaders of the Opposition parties and to re-assemble on the same day at 2.30 p.m.to receive a report of this conference.(2)    To take note that it was expected thatHis Majesty would be returning to Londonimmediately.(3)    That members of the Cabinet should arrange to be available for the weekend in the eventof emergency meetings of the Cabinet being called.(4)    That,pending the publication of an authorisedstatement regarding the proposals,? ministers should carefully abstain from making anyreferences to the subject.The Cabinet adjourned at 12.10 p.in.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.22nd August, 1931.
