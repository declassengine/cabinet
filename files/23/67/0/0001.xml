The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumby the Secretary of State for War (acting in thismatter also for the Minister of Pensions) and theSecretary of State for India (C.P.-101 (31))submitting for Cabinet approval a draft settlement,drawn up by their predecessors in 1927, of warcharges between the United Kingdom and India.The late Cabinet had decided on the 16th March, 1927,that this draft settlement should &quot;for the present&quot;remain unsettled.    For reasons given in the joint memorandum, the Chancellor of the Exchequer had nowwithdrawn an embargo which his predecessor had placed on the war settlement.   Attached to theJoint Memorandum was a resolution which, if theCabinet approved the settlement, would be submittedto the House of Commons, consenting that the extra-ordinary charges of  13,600,000 provisionally met by the Government of India in 1918-19 shall b-eborne by Indian revenues .The Secretary of State for India intimat-ed thatthere was no special urgency in submitting theproposed resolution to the House of Commons^   Ifthe Cabinet approved the settlement he would choosean appropriate time.The Cabinet approved the abovesettlement...

The question had then been referred to the *var Emergency Legislation Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence.-.This Sub-Committee had agreed that the contingencyenvisaged is remote at present, and, if it should arise, could be guarded against by regulations .They had pointed out, however, the extent to which foreign controlling interests, if evilly intentioned.could affect adversely the national resources for defence.    The Sub-Committee had recommended thatthe Department or Departments concerned should becharged with the duty of reporting from time to time as to the extent to which foreign financial interests have control of important British industries .The Cabinet, while taking note that there was noquestion of any interference with foreign financial control of British industries, agreed  That the Departments concerned should be charged with the dutyof watching the situation and reporting from time to time asto the extent to which foreignfinancial interests have controlof important British industries.

The Prime Minister again drew attention tothe fact that the pages of Memoranda circulated tothe Cabinet are often not numbered.   He invited hiscolleagues to draw the attention of their Depart-ments to the matter and to ensure that in future,for convenience of reference, all Notes or Memorandacirculated to the Cabinet should be paged.
&quot;NTFRNATIONAL 5. The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandum&quot;LABOUR - DRAFTCONVENTION by the Home Secretary and the Minister of LabourCONCERNING m!TK^MARKING OF (C.P.-1G3 (31))  inviting attention to a draftInn HE WEIGH&quot;1 ONHEAVY PACKAGES   Convention concerning the marking of the weight onTRANSPORTEDBY VESSELS. heavy packages transported by vessels, which wasadopted at the Twelfth Session of the International(previous reference: Labour Conference held at Geneva in 1929.   TheCabinet 21(31),  Con-        object of the proposal, it was explained, was toelusion 11.)protect the dock worker against the dangers to whichhe is exposed through the collapse of cranes usedto lift heavy packages of unknown weight, whichexceed the capacity of the crane.    Communicationshad been entered into with the German Government,and it was now proposed to ascertain the intentions of the Governments of the chief exporting countries of the world as to the ratification of the DraftConvention, and, in doing so, to inform them, thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to intro-duce the legislation necessary to enable them to ratify the Draft Convention if it be found that thecountries whose adhesion is necessary to make itpractically effective are also prepared to ratify.The Cabinet agreed -.-(a) To approve the above procedure:(b) That in the communication to foreigncountries some reference should bemade to the necessity for securinginternational co-operation in theadministration of the Convention:(c) That the Home Secretary, the Presidentof the Board of Trade and the Ministerof Labour should consult together asto how decision (b) should be dealtwith. .
6, The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thathe and his colleagues designated at the meeting referred to in the margin had met the Members foragricultural constituencies who support the Govern-ment in the House of Commons and had had a friendlydiscussion with them on the subject of agricultural policy.    The Ministers had explained to the Membersof Parliament the difficulties involved in various proposals that had been mentioned.   The meeting had then been adjourned to enable the Members of Parlia-ment to consider the matter further, and on theunderstanding that they would inform the PrimeMinister when they were prepared for a fresh meeting.The Cabinet took note of the Prime Minister^statement, and agreed  That the subject should be continued on the Agenda Paper .
IRON AND steel trade.Re-organisa-tion of*(previous reference:Cabinet 24(31),  Con-elusion 3.)7.   The President of the Board of Trade saidthat he had met Mr Lloyd George and various membersof the Liberal Party on the previous evening andhad explained to them the position of the Iron andSteel industry.   Their attitude had been friendly,and they had every desire to help.   They had,however, asked for further information, and thePresident of the Board of Trade sought authorityto let them see Mr Bruce Gardner&apos;s Report and theReport of the Iron and Steel Committee of theEconomic Advisory Council &apos; CP.-189 (30)).(NOTE: The remainder of the discussion on this subject was concernedwith the above request.   As it-raises a question affectingCabinet procedure it is dealtwith In the following Minuteunder a separate heading.)
)ommuniea-sion of, toPersonsjutside the]cabinet.- r     11r. tv8. In the course of the discussion referred toin the preceding Minute, the question -was raised as to whether certain Cabinet documents could properly be shown to members of the Liberal Partyconsidering the question of co-operation with theGovernment on a certain range of questions.While it was recognised that it was difficult for the persons concerned to decide on the extentof their co-operation without fuller informationthan is at the present stage available to them as members of the House of Commons, it was alsorealised that an important question of principle would be raised if confidential matter were commu-communicated to certain members of one Party in theHouse of Commons  (which is not the Party on whichthe Government mainly relies for support) and notto other Parties or Members, including those who doregularly support the Government.    It was felt,however, that a distinction might perhaps be made between the Leader of a Party, as well, perhaps, asPrivy Councillors, and other Members of Parliament.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That, as a matter of principle, itwould not be right to treat aCommittee of Members of Parliamentwho belong to another Party on thesame footing as members of theCabinet, who, as Privy Councillors,have taken an Oath of Secrecy;the members of that Party must beregarded generally as being in thesame position as other Members ofParliament:(l) That the Prime Minister should discuss the matter with Mr LloydGeorge with a view to arrangingsome appropriate procedure;   possibly,for example, by allowing the leader of the Party concerned to see the papers, and to make a statement basedthereon to the Members of Parliamentco-operating with him. in the matter.
TAT TONALIEALTFCNSURANOE.Maternityaid Special-Is t Services,Pr previous reference :Cabinet 24151),  C on-cltis ion il e)9 . The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Health (CP.-63 (31)) recalling that,as a result of the Conclusions of the cabinet referred to in the margin, he had announced thepolicy of the Government at Llandudno.   This policy was that it was the intention of the Government toproceed with the alternative and less costly schemefor dealing with maternity mortality (CP.-300 (30))but that there should be consultation with theauthorities concerned as to the larger scheme.It was further laid down that no cost should be caused to the Exchequer under the latter schemebefore April 1. 19 32, and that the Minister would do his utmost to secure economies on the Ministryof Health Vote to count.er-balance the cost.   Hehad been proposing to begin negotiations with the approved Societies&apos; Consultative Council when he received a letter from the Chancellor of theExchequer expressing the view that the scheme mustbe postponed owing to the increasing seriousness ofthe financial position, which rendered it impossibleto embark on large new expenditure until prosperityreturned.   The Minister of Health, while appreciatingthe view of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, feltthat before he could accept it he must have a decisionof the Cabinet, since it was the Cabinet who decidedthat he should proceed on the lines referred toabove and should make a public announcement of thepolicy .The Minister of Health informed the Cabinetthat he was under constant pressure from Women&apos;sSocieties and other interested persons on thismatter.   He would be in a difficult position if he- Q-
had to admit that no consultations were proceeding as to the larger scheme.    In the course of thediscussion he informed the Cabinet that negotiations were likely to take a year, after which the bill would have to be introduced.    In the circumstances he could see no prospect of the Government beinginvolved in any expenditure for two years cOn the understanding that no provision would haveto be made for expenditure even in the- next Budget,the Cabinet agreed  To authorise the Minister of health to proceed with consultations withthe authorities concerned as to thelarger scheme for dealing withMaternal Mortality.

The Cabinet had. before them the following bills, introduced by Private Members, which aredown for consideration by the House of Commons onFriday, May 1st:-THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES (PUBLICITY) BILL,down for Report Stage:THE LEASEHOLD ENFRANCHISEMENT BILL,down for Second Reading:THE ROAD TRAFFIC ACT,  19 30 (AMENDMENT) BILL,down for Second Reading.While no special comment was made on the twoformer Bills, the Road Traffic Act, 19 30 (Amendment)Bill was felt to be open to objection, and it wassuggested that the most convenient eventualitywould be that that item on the Order Paper shouldnot be taken.The Home Secretary and the Minister of Healthwere asked to see the Parliamentary Secretary tothe Treasury with a view to a full d.is cuss iontaking place on the two former Bills.
THE ARCHITECTS(REGISTRATION)BUI.(Previous; Reference:I Cabinet 23(31),  Con-clusion 7.)11. The Lord President of the Council informed the Cabinet that,  in accordance with what he understood to be the views of his colleagues, he proposed to support the Architects (Registration)Bill when it came before the ^ouse of Lords.    Therewere one or two amendments which he was informedwere desirable from the point of. vie1-  of privy council practice, and which he hoped to be able toarrange with those in change of the Fill.&quot;&quot;he Cabinet approved the aboveprocedure.
THE coal situation.(previous reference:Cabinet 24(31).  Con-elusion 5.)fx12,The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary for Mines (CP,-102 (31)), circulatedby direction of the Prime Minister, which had alreadybeen circulated to the Cabinet Committee on the coal situation, relative to the proposals for a Bill toamend the Coal Mines (Minimum Wage) Act, 1912, putforward by the Miners&apos; Federation and the Miners&apos;Group in the House of Commons.As the whole question was at present underconsideration by a Cabinet Committee, the cabinet decided not to discuss the coal situation.11-7
13,The Cabinet bad before them Memoranda by theChief of the Imperial General Staff and by theChief of the Naval Staff,  circulated respectivelyby the Secretary of State for War &apos;0.P.-96 (31))and the First Lord of the Admiralty (CP.-100 (31)),containing appreciations of the Military situationin Europe and the general Naval situation in 1931.Both these Memoranda had been prepared in connectionwith the Sub-Committee of the Committee of ImperialDefence on Disarmament, and the opinions expressedin the appreciations were those of the respectiveChiefs of Staff.The Cabinet took note of the above.
14.. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by   lwthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-109(31)) describing the present position of the negotia-tions with the Chinese Government for the abolitionof extraterritoriality, and the course of actionwhich, with the cabinet&apos;s approval, the Secretary ofState proposed to follow.    It was explained thatHis MajestyTs Minister at Peking had succeeded in securing the assent of the Chinese Government to mostof the safeguards desired for the protection ofBritish trade and interests.    In the course of thenegotiations, after consultation with the variousBritish interests primarily concerned, it had beenfound possible to agree to the surrender of criminal jurisdiction, but only on condition that agreement for the present was reached on the question of reserving/the settle-^.ments of Shanghai, Tientsin, Canton and Hankow from.the operation of the Treaty.    In the last resort,however, the British Minister had been authorised togive way on Canton and Hankow.   The Memorandumcontained a number of strong arguments in favour of refusing to consent to any immediate surrender ofthe four ports, or at least of Shanghai and Tientsin,not only in the interests  of British nationals butalso from the point of view of the position of othercountries and of a permanent settlement.   TheSecretary of State therefore considered that the bestpolicy was to endeavour to bring home to the ChineseGovernment that the course proposed was the best intheir own interests,, and that they would be well advised to sign the Treaty excluding the fourreserved areas for the time being.    It was furtherintimated.-that it could be suggested to the ChineseGovernment, as a way out of the present difficulty,
&apos; -    20that  an International Commission should be set up,after the entry of the Treaty into force, to study the question of reserved areas, settlements and concessions.Copies of a Supplementary Note by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs (C.P.-109A (31)) were handed round at the Meeting of the Cabinet, circu-lating a telegram he had received from Sir MilesLamps on in regard to the Chinese offer for theinclusion of Shanghai Settlement only for threeyears,  and submitting for the approval of theCabinet a draft telegram in reply rejecting theoffer .After the two latter telegrams had been read tothe Cabinet and discussed, the Cabinet agreed  To approve the draft telegram to theBritish Minister in China, attachedto C.P.-109A (?1), and reproduced in the Appendix.
PORmEDITSreviouseference:cabinet 2431), Con-lus ion 4.)15.    The Lord Privy Seal informed The^OaTriineU    21that the proposed joint meeting with representatives-____..of the Cabinet,  of the Federation of BritishIndustries, the mrades Union Congress general council., and the Russian Trade Delegation, wouldnot, as at present arranged, take place,    mheFederation of British Industries had reported thatthe firms concerned were unwilling to take part ina joint conference, and the Russian Soviet repre-sentative had indicated difficulties.   Eoth the firms concerned and the Russian Trade Delegation,,however., were prepared to meet representatives ofthe Government separately,.The President o-p the Board of Trade added tothe information given by the Lord Privy Seal thathe had arranged provisionally for any separatemeetings with the firms concerned and the russian soviet representative to be preceded by a talkbetween the Cabinet Ministers concerned and theChairman of the Export Credits Committee..   In replyto a question he said that the Manager of the export credits Guarantee&apos;Department (wr F.H,Nixon) wouldbe glad to allow any member of the Cabinet who so desired to see what had been done by the Export-Credits Guarantee Department up to the. present timein connection with Russian tr?de,  and with whatresults .mhe Cabinet were informed that a meeting between representatives       the Government, the TradesUnion Congress General Council, and the representa-tive of the Russian Soviet would be inadvisable.The lattex- -as likely to use it as an opportunityfor propaganda.,  and in the absence of the firms concerned it would be difficult to check hisstatements.
After considerable discussion, the cabinet agreed  That the Cabinet Committee shouldendea\rour to ascertain whatbusiness was offered by the RussianSoAT-iet representative, and, i.-&quot; so,on what precise terms.,  includingthe length and amount of the credit and the extent of the guaranteerequired, whether by banks or theGovernment .

APPENDIX TO CABINET 26  (51).FOREIGN OFFICEApriltDespatchedM.Your telegram No. 137 (of April27th;    extraterritoriality negotiations).10    For the reasons stated in my telegram No.  77, Dr. Wang&apos;s offer is not acceptable and cannot even he made a basisof discussion.      In particular His Majesty&apos;sGovernment cannot consent to a fixed time limit for the surrender of jurisdiction inthe International Settlement at Shanghai asthe effect of this would be to tie a roperound the necks of the Municipal Council andrender impossible the negotiation on a satis--factory basis of the adjustments that wouldhave to be made in the administration of theSettlement..or desirable to carry the negotiations re-garding reserved areas any further untilChinese negotiations with the other powers have reached such a stage as to permit of their being brought into the discussion.     this position could probably best be achieved by adopting the proposal of a joint commissionsuggested in my telegram No.  77.2.It does not seem either possible
3.    My immediately succeeding telegramcontains the gist of a confidential despatch no.  700 just received from His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Washington.      You should as dis-creetly as possible use this and other informa-tion of a like character already in yourpossession to prove to Dr. Wang that the UnitedStates would be as greatly alarmed as ^apan and france at any undue haste in dealing with thequestion of the reserved areas.4.    Dr. Wang is doubtless influenced bya desire to meet the Convention of May 5th witha spectacular success to his credit, without which he may feel that his own position may be in danger.      It is important therefore that heshould clearly understand that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment cannot possibly give way and that any impression to the contrary that he may havederived from the Chinese Minister in London hasno foundation in fact.      We cannot give Dr. Wangthe spectacular success he desires because itwould ruin all that has been achieved by the&quot;negotiations of the last few months.      If Dr. V/angpersists in his present attitude there is grave danger that the consultations, which we contemplatedholding with the other Powers with a view to bringing them more into line with pur own policy
towards China, may he turned into consultations with a view to discovering some means of offeringjoint resistance to the unreasonable demands putforward by China,      I trust that Dr. Wang will put the interests of his country above all other considerations and seek a way out of the present difficulties on the lines suggested in my telegramNo.  77.
