M-8*- x vJCHARING ORCSSBRIDGE SCHEME.(previous reference:Cabinet  37(51),  Con-Glusion 6.)f.R.2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Transport (C.P.-165 (31)) reporting that the Improvements Committee of the London CountyCounoil had examined the Report of the AdvisoryCommittee, and stating that there can be little doubt that the Council will adopt the recommenda-tion of the Improvements Committee that a Bill be promoted in the next Session of Parliament to giveeffect to Scheme No.6^ which was recommended by themajority of the Advisory Committee provided that thegrant from the Road Fund of 75 per cent, is guaran-teed by the Government .    The near approach of the summer vacation rendered an early decision necessary if the London County Council are to be in a positionto introduce the Bill in the next parliamentary session.    The financial aspects of the project were examined, and it was estimated that the Government&apos;s share of 75 per cent, from the Road Fund wouldinvolve an expenditure of  9,575,000 spread overa period of seven years.   Any decision must take account of the following considerations:-(a) The ability of the Treasury at thepresent time to enter into so large a commitment:(b) The danger, on the other hand, ofmissing the opportunity presented bythe fact that the London CountyCouncil are prepared to proceedwith this great improvement:(c) The odium that may attach to theGovernment if Waterloo Bridge ispulled down as a result of the refusal of the Government to supportthe scheme..The Minister of Transport reported that theAdvisory Committee had met and was likely again torecommend Scheme No.6.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed theCabinet that the economic situation was so serious that there could be no question at present ofincurring any Government expenditure on CharingCross Bridge.The Cabinet accepted the view ofthe Chancellor of the Exchequer.
3LECT9RALREFORM.Repre3 enta-tion off thepeople Bill.(Pr evi previous reference:Cabinet 37(31),  Oon-clusion 1.)a.3..   The Home Secretary reported that the Houseof Lords had made most drastic alterations in the representation of the People Bill.   He explainedthat,  owing to the time that had elapsed since theintroduction of the Bill,  a few small technicalamendments had become necessary.The Cabinet were reminded that in a statement on the Business of the House of Commons made bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer on behalf of thePrime Minister on the previous Thursday, the representation of the People Bill had been mentionedamong the measures to be passed before the Recess.They were given to understand, however,  that thiswas not a binding pledge,  and that the Governmentwould be free to deal with the matter after the recess .After discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That if the Representation of thePeople Bill returned to the Houseof Commons from the House of lords in the mutilated form that appeared likely, the Government should invitethe House of Commons to return theBill in the original form to theHouse of Lords with a view topassing it under the parliament act:(b) That no risk must be run of exempt-ing the Bill from the operation ofthe Parliament Act by amendment,and that such amendments as mightbe deemed necessary should be sentto the House of Lords in the form ofa Schedule of Suggestions by theHouse of Commons:(c) That the Minister in charge of theBill in the House of Lords shouldbe authorised to state that the bill had been so badly mutilated that theGovernment would advise the House ofCommons not to accept it in the formpassed by the House of Lords.

(j Kj *J2B LOCAL 5. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by3YERNMENTCLERKS) the Minister of Health (CP.-172 (31)) urging thatILL.the Local Government (Clerks) Bill, which has passed through the House of Lords, has received anunopposed Second Reading in the House of commons and now stands referred to Standing Committee A,should be taken over by the Government .   Thiscourse would enable him to secure the passage into law of a useful measure without taking up any time on the floor of the House.   No grant fromthe Exchequer was involved.    If the Bill waastarred it would be referred to Standing Committee Das soon as the Town a&apos;nd Country Planning Bill isthrough Committee, which was expected, by July 14th.The primary object of the Bill was the separation of the office of Clerk of the County Council fromthat of Clerk of the Peace.On the understanding that no timecould be given on the Floor of theHouse of Commons, the cabinet approved the proposal of theMinister of Health that the LocalGovernment (Clerks) Bill shouldbe starred.
Igor rificat ionI RAILWAYS .fpreviousXeferenoe:cabinet 22(SI), Con-le ins ion 13.)6.The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Transport (CP.-170 (31)) on thesubject of the electrification of main line railways,covering and commenting on the observations of theRailway Companies upon the Report of Lord Weir&apos;sCommittee (CP.-82 (31)).   The Railway Companiesreoognised that electrification would be of material assistance in bringing about the general electricaldevelopment of the country and might enable substan-tial savings in railway working expenses to berealised, but criticised the financial estimates ofLord Weir&apos;s Committee and made clear that they couldnot finance the expenditure out of their own resources.   The Minister, in his Memorandum,  discuss-ed the various methods by which, in the above circum-stances,  electrification might be secured.   Beforeformulating definite recommendations, however, he desired an opportunity of discussing the matter with his colleagues in relation to the Government&apos;industrial and commercial policy as a whole and fromthe point of view of the financial position and thegeneral legislative programme and parliamentary time-table of the Government.After discussion of a preliminary characterthe Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Memorandum by the Ministerof Transport (CP.-170 (31)) shouldbe referred to a Cabinet Committee,composed as follows:-The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Transport,The Lord Privy seal i(b) To reserve for further considers-tion the question of publication^ PU-(NOTE: The Prime Minister returned shortly before the above decisions were taken. )

The Minister indicated thatif it were desired to deal with the problem in thepresent Parliament it would be possible to formulatelegislation for introduction in the course of thenext Session.

fepARATlONS ANDMER-ALLIED:eonomie Crisisn G ermany.roposedoliticalonference .previous reference:;Cabinet 37(31), Con-conclusion 3.)P.R.$(3k)(The Secretary of State for Air left the Cabinet during the discussionreferred to below,)we J8. The Prime Minister made a statement to theCabinet on the critical economic situation whichhad arisen in Germany and which threatened to cause serious reactions in this country and in the worldgenerally.    The latest news indicated the probability of an economic collapse in Germany.    He read to theCabinet a &quot;Most Immediate&apos;&apos; telegram from the british ambassador in Washington (No.424,  of July 14th)stating the view of the United States Governmentthat a Conference of Heads of Governments at theearliest possible moment wan now most desirable,with the limited object of dealing with the immediateerisis, although wider issues might have to be raisedeventually.    They left it to His Majesty&apos;s Governmentta decide what Governments should be invited, and allother details.   The American Secretary of State, whowas due in Paris the same afternoon, would representthe United States ef America.The view of the Chancellor of the Exchequer met with general acceptance that, the meeting of theConference of Experts arranged in London for Friday,July 17th,  ought to be postponed.    It was felt thatthe situation had passed beyond the stage when anygood result could be expected from a discussion on technical matters arising out of the Franco-Americanconversations rn the Hoover Proposal.The Cabinet recognised that the good psycholog-ical effect of President HooverTs proposal had been destroyed owing tc the time spent in Paris inhaggling over details.    One of the main objects ofa Political Conference, as proposed from Washington,would be to restore in some degree the atmospherecreated by the Hoover Proposal.    The participation of the United States of America, in the person of
its Secretary of State, in a Political Conference inEurope was recognised as likely to contribute 256powerfully to this result.    Nevertheless it was realised that the decision whether to send invita-tions to a Conference or not must depend to a consid-erable extent on the attitude of Prance, who was mainly responsible for losing the good effect of president Hoover&apos;s proposal and was mainly in a positionto relieve the economic situation in Germany.During the discussion the Prime Minister left the Cabinet in order to speak on the telephone tothe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, wrho wason a visit to Paris .    On returning,  the Prime minister informed the Cabinet that he had impressed on theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs the desire ofthe Cabinet to know the general attitude of the Frenchand whether it was their intention to allow an economiccollapse to take place in Germany without any attempttoprevent  it.   He had also arranged that the Secretaryof State should see the United States Secretary ofState (Mr Stimson), who was due in Paris the same afternoon.    The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairshoped to telephone the result of his conversations with members of the French Government and Mr Stimson at p.m.    The Prime Minister added that it might possibly be necessary for him to sianmon a Meeting ofthe Cabinet after the receipt of that information.The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave the Cabinetsome particulars of what had taken place at the meetingof the Bank for International Settlements at Basle.Dr. Luther, the President of the Reichsbank,who h.adalready ascertained during visits to London and Paristhat no further guarantees or credits could be givenby the central banks in those Capitals, had attended
the Basle meeting.   The result had been that dr. Luther had been told that the matter had passed beyond the power of the Banks to deal withand had become a political question.    The Chancellorexplained that the present crisis had not arisenout of the German Budget situation, which was not unsatisfactory, but was a collapse of confidence.He explained the reactions of the situation on theCity of London, where the banks had accepted largenumbers of German Bills which, in the normal courseof events, were maturing every day.   He indicated the possibility of the Government having to take action to deal with the situation.   The german economic crisis had already had grave reactions in Austria and Hungary.   He feared that any delay in summoning a Conference might prove disastrous.The Cabinet agreed . To leave to the Prime Minister andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, on receipt of further information fromthe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs in Paris, the decision onall matters arising out of theeconomic crisis, including the summoning or not of an international conference, the postponement or not of the Conference of Experts, as wellas of the visit of the Prime Ministerand the Foreign Secretary to Berlin.

The Prime Minister consulted his colleagues asto whether the time had yet come to appoint aCabinet Committee to deal with the Report of thejvtacmillan Committee on Finance and Industry.The Cabinet were reminded that the Chancellorof the Exchequer had promised a further commentaryto be prepared in the Treasury.The subject was postponed untilthe Treasury report was available.1
O u JMEMBERS OF 10.      The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that parliament,a strong feeling had grown up in all parts of thepayment of. House of Commons that when a Member of parliament was suspended his salary should be withdrawn.      A(previous reference: Question was to be addressed to him on the subjectCabinet 2f9(21), App.IIl).    within the next day or two.After discussion,  the Cabinet agreed  That the Prime Minister,  whenquestioned on the subject, should state that the Government are willing that the House of Commons shouldsettle the question.      They would prefer that the resolution to be-  discussed by the House of commons should not be drawn up by theGovernment alone, and should proposediscussion through the usual channels.      He should promise togive time for the discussion of thequestion after the Recess.
PARLIAMENTARY 11..    The Cabinet agreed  BUSINESS.That the House of Commons should re-assemble on October 20th,   (unless(previous the Prime Minister should on a reference: review of Parliamentary businessCabinet yj find some other date more convenient)(51), Con- and should complete the Government&apos;selusion 1 ). programme of business beforeProrogation.      The next sessions should begin at the end of Januaryor the beginning of February.
J* DISARMAMENTIference.foe Three-jar tyjoramitt ee.Previousleterence:Eabinet 29iji), Con-conclusion   1 ) ,FX12.    The Prime Minister informed, the Cabinetthat the Three-Party Sub-Committee of the Committeeof Imperial Defence was on the verge of agreeinga series of Resolutions on the aims of andsubjects to be dealt with by the international conference on Disarmament.      The Government would soon have to decide on the personnel of the delegation at the Conference.      He recalled thatwhen the Opposition Leaders had been invited to nominate representatives for the Three-PartySub-Committee,  the hope had been expressed thatthe delegation of the United Kingdom at Genevamight be representative of the various political parties.      He gathered, however,   that theConservative Party were now averse to taking part in the delegation.      The general view of theCabinet was that unless all three Parties could berepresented in the&apos; United Kingdom delegation, itwould be desirable that that delegation should be composed ronly of nominees of the Government.The Secretary of State for Dominion&quot;affairs recalled that the Governments of the Dominions hadnominated representatives in London for purposesof consultation on matters relating to the Disarma-ment Conference.      He thought it desirable that heand the First Lord of the Admiralty should confer with these representatives as a preliminary to consultation with the Governments as to the fillingin of the information required by the League ofNations in September.
The Prime Minister invited, the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs to confer withhim on the subject with a view to an appropriateprocedure being arranged.The Prime Minister also intimated thathe hoped to be in a position to settle the composition of the United Kingdom delegation at an early date.

Paper No.l056-B):(iii) A Note by the Secretary summarising the decisions taken on various occasions since the end of the War(C.I.D. Paper No.l055-B) .The Cabinet took note of   the follow-ing recommendations of the Committee of ImperialDefence:-(a) That it should still be assumed, forthe purpose of framing the estimates of the Fighting Services, that at any given date there will be no major war for ten years:(b) That the situation should again bethoroughly examined in the light of developments in 19 32,  on which thecontinuance or otherwise of thepresent policy must necessarily depend.
jHB LONDONdXSSKNOBRTransportBILL.(previous reference :Cabinet 37(30, Con-clusion 1 ).13.    The Minister of Transport informed theCabinet that he was hoping that the discussionof the London Passenger Transport Bill in committee might be completed before adjournment of Parliament.
