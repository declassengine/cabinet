China.ti*aterritc-ality in.adlock ingotiationsreviouseference:cabinet 2631), Con-rusion 14.)1. The Secretary of State for For-eign affairs informed the Cabinet that the negotiations with china as to extraterritoriality and for a Treatysettlement had now reached a deadlock.   He then &apos;read the draft of a statement which he proposed tomake in the House of Commons in reply to Questions,the same afternoon.The statement was discussed, and the last sentence was amended by the inclusion of the wordsunderlined in Appendix I.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should be author-is ed to make to the House ofCommons the statement attached in Appendix I.-1-
2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (cp.-115(31)) dealing with the serious political situation that has arisen out of the agreement reached byGermany and Austria to conclude a Customs Union(Appendix II).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,amplifying and slightly correcting his memorandum in the light of the latest information, stated thatthe Germans were anxious to bring up the subject ata meeting of the European Committee of Inquiry to beheld at Geneva on May 15th, but that the FrenchGovernment were understood to wish to avoid a discussion of the question in its economic aspectsuntil the juridical issues had been considered.He was now inclined, therefore, to try and securethat both aspects should be considered simultaneously.He would propose that the question should be referred,in its economic aspects, to a League Committee, withsome rather wide terms of reference such as &quot;Toconsider the whole question of the proposed customs union in the light of the economic position in Europe&apos;&apos;At the same time, after discussion of the question at the Council in its legal aspects, the question might be referred to the Hague Court for an EmergencyOpinion, since otherwise a long delay would be involved.    Before the next Meeting of the Councilin August or September, Reports on both aspeets ofthe question should be available.    The Secretaryof State oalled particular attention to a passageat the end of his Memorandum in which he expressedthe hope that, as the President of the Board of Trade
would &quot;be unable to go to Geneva to take part in theimportant discussions which are impending, he himselfmight be given a sufficiently free hand to enable his Majesty&apos;s Government to contribute to the commonwork of removing the political danger which had been created by the proposal to set up an Austro-GermanCustoms Union.In the course of the discussion attention was drawn to the various alternative proposals to the austro-German Customs Union.    A caveat was enteredas to the proposal of the French and Czecho-SlovakGovernments, and more particularly the suggestion(Appendix IT, page 7, Para.(b)) that Great britain should be asked, in view of the special circumstances,to forgo rights of most-favoured-nation treatment.It was pointed out also that under this proposal weshould be placed in an inferior position to Austria,notwithstanding our policy of Free Trade.    In short,we should be prejudiced by the effect of the proposalsboth in the matter of most-favoured-nation treatment and on our trade in foreign markets.    The extensionof a system of international cartels (Appendix II,page 7, para.(c)),  it was suggested, would also be detrimental to our trade.   Criticism was also directed,more particularly from the point of view of theDominions, against the &quot;unofficial&quot; British suggestionon page 8 that the United Kingdom should undertakefor a fixed period, say three years, not to alter her present tariff system.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs explained that he had desired to acquaint the Cabinetvery fully with the various proposals that might be mentioned.   He did not anticipate, however, that

He did not anticipate, however, that-3-
in the course of a dlscussioru-at-the -League -exrtendingover only two days, there would be any attempt toreach decisions on these matters.   Later on, if aCommittee were set up on the economic aspects ofthe question, he would have to concert closely withthe President of the Board of Trade and to consult the Cabinet..The Cabinet agreed  That in the forthcoming discussions at Geneva the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should use his discretion on matters of detail,but that if any questions ofprinciple should arise, such asthose raised by the various proposals s-ummarised in his Memo-randum, he should adopt a non-r-eommittal attitude and might ask that they should be formulated indetail and in writing.

The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that he had now received theItalian comment on the British reply to the FrenchMemorandum on the Franco-Italian Naval question,which had been approved by the Cabinet at the meeting referred to in the margin.   The Italian Governmentwas in complete agreement with the British attitude.He was inclined to think that no reply- would bereceived from the French Government until after the presidential Flection in France on May 13th.    Inview of the deadlock which had been reached, he contemplated political conversations on the subjectduring the forthcoming Meetings of the League ofNations at,Geneva.

The Memorandum dealt with apprehen-si ons which had been expressed by the Admiraltylest action which the League may recommend in orderto satisfy themselves that their requests for thewithdrawal of forces have been implemented underthe provisions of Articles 2 and 3 of the model treaty should be interpreted as giving liberty of inspection of naval ports,  dockyards or establish-ments .    Such a provision might,  in the Admiraltyfsopinion, be detrimental to national security.   Thematter had first been raised at the Committee ofImperial Defence and subsequently discussed at aconference arranged by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, as the result of which Lord Cecil,in consultation with the Admiralty and the legal adviser of the Foreign Office, had drawn up thefollowing proviso to Article 3, Proposal B, of the model Treaty:-&quot;The preceding paragraph shall not,however, require any High contracting party to permit any inspection more extensive than is actually necessaryto enable the Council^ repreaenta--( tives to satisfy themselves byinvestigation on the spot that anywithdrawal recommended by the council under Article 2 (l) has been effected,or that any recommendation made by theCouncil under Article 2 (2) and acceptedby the High Contracting Party concerned is being complied with.   Moreover itshall not in any case require any HighContracting Party to permit inspection of or at any military, naval or airbase&quot; .As the above draft involved an amendment to theinstructions previously approved by the Cabinet, thePrime Minister asked the Cabinet to give its approvalThe Cabinet approved, the draftproviso quoted above.

6. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thaton the previous day he had seen Mr Lloyd George andSir Herbert Samuel and had explained to them thedifficulty discussed at the last Meeting of theCabinet as to the communication of Memoranda ofthe Cabinet and such bodies as the Economic AdvisoryCouncil to persons outside the Cabinet.   Mr LloydGeorge and Sir Herbert Samuel had appreciated thedifficulties and it had been arranged that when itwas necessary to communicate such documents theyshould be sent to Sir Herbert Samuel, who, as a PrivyCouncillor, would be careful to treat them with full regard to the obligations of his Oath as a PrivyCouncillor.(For the application of this to theIron and Steel Trade Report see thefollowing Minute.)
ION ANDU TRADE.organisationevioussference:cabinet 2651), Con-tusion 7.)7.    The Prime Minister informed the Cabinetthat, in accordance with the prihciple recorded inthe previous Conclusion, he had Undertaken that acopy of the Report of the Economic Advisory Councilon the Iron- and Steel Trade should be communicatedto Sir Herbert Samuel.The President of the Board of Trade stated thathe had asked the Governor of the Bank of Englandand Mr Bruce Gardner whether they would givepermission for the Bruce Gardner Report to becommunicated to the Liberal Leaders .    Owing to the confidential nature of some of the statements    .&apos;//contained in the Report, however^-Ohuy were, miwarllirg%t)j%iv-^t-hic pormiaoion^    In this conversation ithad also transpired that these gentlemen were strongly opposed to the idea of a Public UtilityCompany for the Iron and Steel trade.The Chancellor of the Exchequer reported tfyatthe Governor of the Bank of England was considerablyperturbed at the idea that the Government might becontemplating the formation of a Public UtilityCompany.   He. had indicated that in those circum-stances the efforts towards the re-organisation ofthe industry being made by the Securities ManagementTrust could not be continued.In this connection the Prime Minister mentioned that he had received information as to certainamalgamations that had already been effected inthe Iron and Steel industry.The Cabinet felt that there was a certain amountof ambiguity as to the attitude of the Governor ofthe Bank.   When the question had been discussed onApril 22nd (Cabinet 24 (31), Conclusion 2), theCabinet had been given to understand that there was
no likelihood of money being obtained for there-organisation of the Iron and Steel industry fromthe investing, public (particularly in view of thefailure of a recent issue in connection with there-organisation of the Cotton trade) unless coupled with some form of protection to the industry from foreign competition^.   Now, however, it appeared thatthe Securities Management Trust was still&apos; continuingits efforts and that the Governor of the Bank ofEngland only proposed to desist from these effortsowing to his apprehensions of Government intervention.It was felt that this situation would have to be cleared up before a decision could be taken as tothe President of the Board of Trade&apos;s proposals forthe rationalisation of the industry.As the result of the discussion the cabinet agreed  (a) That the Prime Minister, theChancellor of the Exchequerand the President of the Boardof Trade should discuss thequestion with the Governor ofthe Bank of England, with aview to clearing up the positionas to the attitude of the SecuritiesManagement Trust towards the re-organisation of the industry:(b) That, in execution of the decisionof the Cabinet on April 22, 19 31(Cabinet 24 (31), Conclusion 2(b)),the President of the Board ofTrade should give to Sir HerbertSamuel a copy of the Report ofthe Iron and Steel        -Committeeof the Economic Advisory Council,but should ask him to treat theinformation as strictly personal and confidential for the moment and not to show it to members ofthe Liberal Industrial Committee.The President of the Board ofTrade should intimate that assoon as he could give him greaterlatitude in the matter he wouldmake a further communication.   Heshould also, if this was necessary,inform Sir Herbert Samuel that hewas not in a position to coromunincate the Bruce Gardner Report:
(c) That all members of the cabinet should observe reticence on thedetails of the President of theBoard of Traders proposals forthe re-organisation of the Ironand Steel industry.-11-

Conse-quently the British representatives had taken noactive part in the debates and had abstained from voting.    It was further explained that this attitude had been justified by the event, as the Conventionadopted by the Conference was even wider in scopethan was at first expected, and permitted so manyexceptions that it could not lead to the adoption of anything in the nature of an international standardof hours regulation.    In these circumstances theMinister of Labour had no hesitation in proposing that the Cabinet should decide not to ratify theConvention.The recommendations were also open to objection on the ground that the preamble of each made it clearthat acceptance implied accepting the provisions ofthe draft Convention.The Minister of Labour proposed that the Governmentof the United Kingdom should once more re-state their general attitude to the subject and add that conse-quently they were unable to ratify the Convention

The first of these, signed by two Members of Parliament, wasin opposition to the proposal fora Wheat Quota;    and the second,  infavour of the proposal, was signed by seven Members of Parliament.2.    The Dominion Wheat Quota Scheme.A Report by the Committee on theproposed Imperial Economic Con-ference at Ottawa (CP.-107 (31))containing the following recommend-ations by a majority:-(i) That the United Kingdom Dele-gates to the Ottawa Conferencebe empowered to put forward the proposal of a quota forDominion milled wheat in theUnited Kingdom as part of anygeneral scheme of inter-Imperialeconomic co-operation which mayemerge from the Conference.(ii) That, pending a decision onabove, consultation with the millers on the method of operating the scheme shouldbe deferred.(i)The Prime Minister said that the Memorandain CP.  112 (51) had been circulated, as the resultof the discussions he had been asked to undertakeat the meeting on April 1 -;;th,  (Cabinet 2j5 (^1;,Conclusion 1  (a,).      The report on the Dominion
Y/heat Quota Scheme (C.?.  10/ (3&quot;0)*  ilad- been called for at the same meeting.      In company with the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries he met representativesof the millers,  in order to ascertain their viewson the question of the home wheat quota, as desired by the Cabinet at the same meeting.      The millersadmitted that the position of the farmers was bad, andthat the position of cereal growing in this countryought to be considered.      They did not like the plan of a quota, but if it became the policy of theGovernment they could and would work it.      They had,suggested a plan of their own for the encouragement ofoereal growing , which involved,  inter alia, a prohibition on the importation of foreign flour.The First Lord of the Admiralty read to theCabinet extracts  from a speech by Sir Malcolm A.Robertson, Chairman of Messrs. Spillers Ltd..,  in whichhe stated that not only the Board of this Company butalso the National Association of British and IrishMillers would be strongly opposed to a quota for homegrown wheat which they considered unwise, uneconomicand unnecessary.        Sir Malcolm Robertson had indicated,however,  that his Company at   any rate would endeavourloyally to work, any major policy which was definitelyput before them.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,with reference to Cabinet 23 (31) Conclusion 1   (d),reported that he was not in a position to recommend to the Cabinet any alternative, within the limits ofthe government&apos;s policy,  to the home wheat quota for maintaining cereal farming in this country.      He made
clear that without some assistance of the kind cerealfarming was doomed, and that something approaching the depopulation of considerable parts of Englandwas likely to occur.In this latter connection it was suggestedthat the real fact that had to be faced was thatwheat farming could not be carried out in thiscountry without the expenditure of great sums ofmoney in some form of assistance.After considerable discussion, the cabinet agreed  (a) That a special.Meeting of the cabinet should be held on THURSDAY, JUNE 4-th,at 10..30 a.nu, for the purpose of taking a decision on the two questionsof a quota for Home Grown Wheat and dominion Wheat, and that, if possible,no other, questions should be placedon the Agenda Paper;(b) That Members of the Cabinet shouldbe asked to bear in mind that itmight be necessary to resume theabove discussion In the afternoonor evening of June 4 th.-16-

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe President of the Board of Trade (H.A.-12 (31))covering a draft Merchant Shipping (Safety and LoadLine Conventions) Bill, together with the recommenda-tion of the Committee of Home Affairs thereon (H.A.C.9th Conclusions (31), para.l).    It was recalled thatthe original Bill approved by the Cabinet on October29th,  1930 (Cabinet 65 (30), Conclusion 18) had met with opposition during the Second Reading in the Houseof Lords, on the ground that while carrying out theprovisions of the International Convention for the safety of Life at Sea, 1929, it did not deal with theInternational Convention respecting Load Lines, 19 30.Lord Stanhope had introduced an alternative bill dealing with both Conventions, but drafted in a mannerunsatisfactory to the Board of Trade.    In these circum-stances the Cabinet, at the Meeting referred to in the margin, had decided on the 26th November, 19 30, thata Government Bill covering both Conventions should beprepared, and that the assistance of the shipowners&apos;Parliamentary Committee should be invited.   The present draft was the result of that decision.There was one point of importance on which agree-ment had not been reached.   Where the Board of Trade&apos;sexisting requirements in the case of British ships were higher than the international standard contem-plated under the Convention, the Shipowners&apos; Parlia-mentary Committee would, it was understood, oppose the continuance by the Bill of the Board&apos;s existing powers .The recommendation of the Committee of Home affairs was as follows:-To authorise the withdrawal of the formerMerchant Shipping (Safety Convention) Bill,and the introduction at an early date

APPENDIX I.CHINA.    EX.T RAT ERRIT OR IAL IT Y.(Statement approved by the Cabinet on 6th May, 1931,(Cabinet 27(31),  Conclusion 1), to be made by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the Houseof Commons.)The position with regard to the extraterritorialitynegotiations is that agreement has now been reached on alarge number of the details of a Treaty providing on theone hand for the transfer of jurisdiction over Britishsubjects in China from British to Chinese Courts and onthe other hand for safeguards relating to the administra-tion of justice, calculated to give a feeling of confidence and security to the British nationals and British interestsunder a new regime.       A serious obstacle to the speedyand successful conclusions of the negotiations hashowever arisen in connexion with certain importanttreaty ports,&apos; which in the view of His Majesty&apos;s government must be excluded from the operation of the treaty until such time as necessary changes have been effected in the municipal administrations at those ports to meet thenew situation created by the abolition of extraterritorialrights.This attitude on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwas influenced not only by consideration of the chaos whichmust ensue from any sudden change in jurisdiction at the ports in question, but also by the fact that they could notalone decide the question, having regard to the fact that other Powers were also concerned.As a way out of the difficulty, His Majesty&apos;s&quot;Governmentrecently suggested to the Chinese Government that they
would, be prepared.,, immediately on&apos; the conclusion of thetreaty, to agree to the appointment of a special commission which would proceed forthwith to a study ofthe whole problem of the reserved areas with a viewto finding a satisfactory solution.Unfortunately the Chinese Government have not seen their way to agree either to the point of viewof His Majesty?s Government on the question of the reserved areas or to the appointment of the suggestedcommission.His Majesty&apos;s Government, however, have notabandoned hope that, if time is allowed for further discussion, a satisfactory solution of &quot;this one out-standing difficulty will be found, and i need notemphasise our sincere desire to reach a friendlysettlement.With regard to  other Powers according to thestatement of the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairssatisfactory results have been reached in certain cases, but (in the words of the Chinese Minister forForeign Affairs)  others including United States havenot yielded the desired solution.
nAPPENDIX/TO CABINET 27(jl).CABINET.AGREEMENT BET WE.&apos;EEN THE GERMAN AND AUSTRIANGOVERNMENTS TO CONCLUDE A CUSTOMS UNION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs-A serious political situation has been caused by theagreement arrived at between the German and AustrianGovernments to negotiate a customs union.     As a purelyeconomic proposition we would have no objection to and might indeed welcome such a customs union provided that it was complete and effective.       But in the present case the political issues involved are so seriously far-reaching that the question must be considered primarily from the political point of view.A political union between Germany and Austria isforbidden except with the consent of the Council of theLeague of Nations (which in the present circumstances wouldand another country must be subject to the conditions laid downin the Protocol concluded in 1922 between Great Britain,France, Italy and Czechoslovakia on the one hand and Austriaon the other when under the aegis of the League of NationsProtocol Austria undertakes not to conclude any &quot;specialregime or exclusive advantages calculated to threatenAustria1s economic independence&quot;.Although there would seem to be no question of thepresent Austro-Gennan agreement infringing the Treaty ofVersailles,  it is open to grave doubt whether this agreementcertainly not be given).Any economic union between Austriaa reconstruction loan was granted to Austria.By this
does not run counter to. the- obligations assumed by Austria under the Protocol of 1922.Ostensibly the reason why the German and AustrianGovernments desire a customs union is in order to rescueAustria from imminent economic collapse.       The GermanGovernment in particular, however, have been suspectedin many quarters in Europe of having been inspired by thefollowing ulterior political motives:-(a) By establishing an economic union with Austriathey hope to take.the first step towards a politicaluni on.(b) They hope by putting forward this highlycontentious scheme to awaken the European Governments tothe necessity of really confronting the problem of theeconomic reform and reorganisation of Europe which hasbeen the subject of desultory and ineffective discussions at Geneva during the last three years.(c) If no alternative is offered and at the sametime the ex-allied Governments prevent by legal means the austro-German customs union from materialising, the GermanGovernment hope to use this fact as an argument to showIthat whenever they attempt to improve Germany&apos;s national economic position and extend her markets, they are at oncethwarted, and that therefore the whole question of repara-tions must be reopened,(d) The Brunning Government hoped to strengthen their position with Germany by a forward foreign policy.Prance and Czechoslovakia are the two countries whoare chiefly concerned to prevent at all costs the conclusionof the proposed customs union.       Both of them fear it because
(l) they see in it a first step towards a politicalunion:(2) the agrarian countries in Eastern Europe might be forced to accede to it and thereby prepare the way for germany&apos;s political domination in Central and South-EasternEuropej and(3) both for geographical and economic reasonsCzechoslovakia would probably be starved into acceding tothe union and thereby endangering her national independence&quot;I think it is clear from the above analysis of thepolitical situation created by the Austro-German, proposal that if it is allowed to materialise in its present formit is capable, owing to the fears and suspicions it has aroused, of endangering the whole policy of European co-operation and disarmament which it is the object of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to promote.   For this reason meansmust, in   my opinion, be found for removing- the proposal from the domain of international politics.    But thisought to be effected, not by the imposition of a directveto, but by some gentler method which will save the facesof those directly concerned and not perpetuate the bitter-ness already generated.As soon as I heard of the Austro-German agreement, I proposed, in order to gain time and to get the question under proper control, that the subject should be placed onthe agenda of the forthcoming meeting of the League council who could then, if necessary, consult the Hague Court as
to whether the contemplated union would constitute a violation of the Protocol of 1922.    I realise, however that a merely legal decision, even though given by thoHague Court, is not by Itself going to solve theproblem which has been created.    An inconclusive decision will settle nothing.    A decision in favour of the union would lead France and Czechoslovakia to adopt the mostviolent and dangerous counter-measures for the defenceof their political interests to the detriment of thewhole policy of European co-operation and disarmament.Lastly, a decision condemning the union without anysubstitute being offered would leave Germany and Austriawith a bitter grievance which, as pointed out above, germany would exploit on every possible occasion for politicalends.    It might also lead to the fall of the GermanGovernment and a revival of HitlerisnuIt would of course be possible to allow matters to run their course in the hope that when it came to thepoint there would be so many practical difficulties inthe way that Austria and Germany would never be able toagree on a roal union.    (it is known that there is already considerable objection in certain political and indus-trial circles in Austria to the idea of a union.)Also the German and Austrian Governments have said that other Governments would be free to join the Austro-German customs union.      The Germane and Austrians mightbe taken at their word and we might demand that the
question of the entry of other States into the union should he examined before any further progress ismade with the direct negotiations between Germanyand Austria.      If this course were adopted, thewhole scheme of an extended customs union mightbreak down under its own weight and after monthsof futile discussion this failure would give both germany and Austria the opportunity of savingtheir faces and abandoning the whole idea of a customs union without being accused by their publicopinion of yielding to British or French pressure.But at the best this is a risky and ungratefulpolicy.      Ve may eventually have to come to it but to begin with at any rate I should much prefer to adopt a more constructive course by co-operating with the whole body of European Governments inelaborating some economic solution which bothFrance and Germany would be able to accept as anadequate alternative to the customs union, andwhich would at the same time represent some definiteprogress in the direction of that economic co-operation and &quot;disarmament&quot; between the variousEuropean States towards which we have been strivingin vain for so long.   My intention, therefore, isto start off at any rate by offering my services ashonest broker between France and Germany without
committing myself to either, and thereby to use the present opportunity to advance the cause ofeconomic co-operation between nations.    With thisobject in view I shall try at Geneva to arrange forthe question of the customs union to be dealt withprimarily as an economic rather than as a juridicalor even political problem, and shall advocate thecreation of one or more special technical committees which shall be authorised to examine alternative schemes to take the place of the proposed union.Germany has already placed the question on theagenda of the Commission of Enquiry for european union which meets two days before the League Council,but I do not yet know what line the German representsfive will be instructed to take-       I have told theGerman Ambassador that I shall be glad to beenlightened on this point.
Meanwhile the French and Czechoslovak governments are going to put forward a proposal on the following lines:-(a) In order to prevent the agrarian countries of eastern Europe from being drawn into the Austro-German orbit,the chief grain-importing countries of Europe (exc3.u&amp;ingGreat Britain) should (without, it is hoped, their asking for any quid pro quo), grant a tariff reduction on importsup to a stipulated quota to the agrarian countries (excludingRussia) such as would enable them to dispose of their presentgrain surplus,,     In order that this preference should notencourage over production in the agrarian States, consortiashould be created both in the importing and exporting states in order to regulate the production of and trade in cereals.The grain-producing countries outside Europe should be askednot to claim a similar preference in virtue of their most-favoured-nation treatment.Austria(b) In order to assist/in her economic distress,&quot;whichpres^&quot;tmabl3^^ had driven her into the arms of Germany, theEuropean States generally should grant a preference to specificAustrian goo&amp;s in the form both of a quota and tariff redxiction.The countries enjoying most-favoured-nation treatment, includingGreat Britain, would be asked, in view of the specialcircumstances, to forego their rights,(c) As regards tariff reductions the French schemecontemplates the extension, of the system of international cartelsas being a more promising line of approach than, the proposalshitherto made for a flat reduction covering all goods,(d) The French scheme provides for the creation of aninternational agricultural credit organisation under the Leagueof Nations, in which French banks would co-operate.,Meanwhile other tentative schemes have already been
suggested and i.t will be the work of the technical committees which I have in mind to scrutinise one and all of them, witha view to elaborating a generally acceptable scheme which will serve as an alternative to the proposed customs unionsThe other schemes which have been suggested up todate are:-(1)    An unofficial British suggestio.noIn order to satisfy German and Austrian demands for larger foreign markets, there should be an agreement amongthe protectionist countries to reduce their tariffs by 25%,Great Britain would join in this agreement by undertaking for a fixed period, say three years, not to alter her present tariffsystem0     The protectionist countries which declined to enter the agreement, i0ee, declined to reduce their tariffs, would notbe entitled to enjoy the benefits of reduction by other countriesnotwithstanding their most-favoured-nation rights,(2)    A Belgian semi-official suggestion.The Government concerned should take as basis theprocedure laid down in the Final Act of the Economic Conference(November 1930) whereby Governments were encouraged to negotiatebilateral agreements for the mutual reduction of tariffse     HisMajesty&apos;s Government have already taken action in this sense and negotiations are proceeding between Great Britain and seven othercountrieso      A concerted effort should now be made to extend andhasten these bilateral negotiations so as to include as many countries as possible, and especially France, Germany end Italy,The resultant bilateral agreements sho\xld then be consolidatedinto a collective Convention.      It is hoped that world-wideeconomic pressure, combined with the shock caused by the proposedAustro-German union, would lead many countries to be more forth-coming than would otherwise be- the case0     If the results were successful, it would, like scheme ffo.  (1), secure to Tooth Germanyand Austria that extension of their foreign markets which they require.

Against all these schemes opposition can he raised&quot;both on general grounds and from the point of viev/ of Britishinterests and perhaps of British tariff policy.      The same, nodoubt,  is true of any possible combination of the above schemesor of any other alternative economic solution of the presentEuropean difficulty that may be put forward.      &quot;-/ithout going into a detailed analysis, the Cabinet will no doubt desire to lay it down that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom could not be a party to any international agreement in whichwe were under any obligation to discriminate in the matter of customs duties in favour of countries who are parties to sucha union and against parties who are outside it.      But starting from this basis it may be said that any such schemes as thoseoutlined above may in one way or another raise the following questions of policy.(A),      &quot;Where it is proposed to apply a preferential tariffto meet the present grave politico-economic emergency, we ought,for reasons of high policy, without abandoning our adherence tothe principle of most-favoured-nation treatment, to be willingto introduce a certain elasticity into our interpretation of it,thus:(i)      If in a multilateral agreement for tariff reduction56the continental signatories desire to adopt the new interpretation of most-favoured-nation treatment given     /*     This new interpretation would permit signatories of generalconventions for tariff reduction or removal of other obstacles to international trade to refuse the benefits of such conven-tions to non-signatory states provided the conventions are open to any states which will accept its terms..
two years ago by the Economic Committee, ought we not toagree to allow them to do so? provided the benefit oftheir tariff reductions is extended to Great Britain in virtue of our liberal regime?(ii)   It is conceivable that circumstances might arise in which we should be faced with the demand to give up for a specific purpose e.g. assistance to Austria and within certain limits our most-favoured-nation treatment.(B)   If continental governments are prepared tomake a multilateral agreement for tariff reduction basedon the new interpretation of most-favoured-nation treat-ment, should His Majestys Government in the United Kingdomsecure for Great Britain the advantages of the tariff reductions which that agreement might mean, although theDominions are not also willing to adhere?     (It is ofcourse understood that no such agreement could in any wayaffect the present tariff relations &quot;between Great Britainand the Dominions).(0).   If in the negotiation of an agreement of thekind above described for the general reduction of tariffsthe continental governments request Us, as our contribution-tion to that end, to agree not to put on protective dutiesfor a fixed period of time, shall His Majesty1^ Governmentin the &quot;United Kingdom agree to do so, provided theadvantage to be obtained from the reduction in tariffsis substantial?It must be recognised that if we cannot give an under-taking of this kind, we shall, rightly or wrongly, be held responsible for making a general system of tariff reductionimpossible.
If Great Britain is to &quot;use the present opportunity toco-operate in building up some measure of European economic union, she will be required to make certe.in sacrifices,otherwise she runs the risk of being held responsible for having brought -fco nought the joint efforts of Europe toreplace the dangerous Austro-German customs union by someprogressive scheme for the economic union of Europe.As the President of the Board of Trade will be unableto go to Geneva to take part in the important discussions which are Impending I hope therefore that on the questionsof policy enumerated above I may be given a sufficientlyfree hand to enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to contribute to the common work of removing the political danger whichhas been created by the proposal to set up an Austro-Germancustoms unions(Intlld.)
