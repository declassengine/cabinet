fid2.

However carefullyworded, such a statement would be liable tomisinterpretation, either by one side or the other.He thought it better to adhere closely to ourpublicly-declared policy of non-intervention inEgypt&apos;s internal squabbles.   He had sent a telegram to this effect to Sir Percy Loraine (No.169 of June9th) .
THE FRENCH 3.    The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsCOLONIALEXHIBITION, informed the Cabinet that the French Government were anxious to welcome some members of the United KingdomGovernment on a visit to the Paris InternationalColonial Exhibition.    In this connection he referredto a circular that had been issued from the cabinet office on May 26th.   A &quot;British Week&quot; was to be held between the l^th and 19th July, and it was hopedthat the Prince of Wales might pay a visit towardsthe end of that week.   The Secretary of State wouldbe very glad if any of his colleagues could possiblyfind it convenient to visit the Exhibition.   He himself would be visiting Geneva on July 13th,  and. he proposedto leave London two days earlier in order to enable him to pay a visit to the Exhibition.The Cabinet approved these arrangements.
european0ion.?he Inter-f.tionalnf,riculturalMortgageCredits(previous reference:Cabinet 27/SI). Con-clusion 2.)4.The Cabinet had. before them a Memorandumby -the Seeretary of State for Foreign Affairs(CP.-146 (31)) circulating a Memorandum on thesubject of the International Agricultural MortgageCredits Company which the Commission of Inquiry for european Union decided, at its recent session toset up in connection with its study of the problem,of granting agricultural credits.   At this meetingthe Secretary of State had expressed approval ofthe scheme but had foreseen certain difficultiesfrom the point o^ view of the United Kingdom andhad undertaken to lay the matter before His Majesty&apos;sGovernment for consideration.   He gave reasons forrecommending the acceptance of the Convention byHis Ma j e st y* s G overranent in t he United Kingdom,including a proposed contribution of - 120,000towards a special reserve fund of  1,^000,000 to becontributed by all the Governments parties to theConvention.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs mentioned that this proposal had only come to his knowledge after he had arrived at Geneva for ameeting of the Commission of Inquiry for european union.    He had at once taken steps to ensure thathis colleagues at. home were made fully aware of allthe circumstances.The Cabinet were reminded that when particulars of the proposal had first been received, some doubtshad been felt as to the political expediency of taking part in a scheme devised with the object of facilitating the transfer of agriculture in central and Eastern European countries from cereal to mixedfarming at a time when cereal farming was indistress in this country as well as in the Dominions.
There was general agreement, however,  that the case for participation was strong,  even though suchparticipation might be used to emphasise, by con-trast,  the need for stimulating agriculture in thiscountry.The Cabinet agreed --To approve the acceptance of theConvention,  including the proposedcontribution towards the reserve fund to be made by all the Govern-ments parties to the Convention.

It was statedin the Memorandum that the idea of our co-operating in the presentation of a joint Case either with theFrench or with any other o^ the interested Governmentswas excluded, as the United Kingdom case could not beregarded as identical with the French.    Strong argu-ments were given in the memorandum \im both for and against separate British participation in the proceed-ings before the Hague JXourt......After a full examination of the issues, theCabinet agreed  (a) That the policy should be as--fa&quot;r-aspossible to maintain a neutralposition in the controversy beforethe Hague- Court, in order that theGovernment might remain in the best position possible to exercise itsgood offices in finding a solution to the political issues involvedwhich v-otild arise Subsequent to the findings o.^ the Court, and that thispolicy could best be advanced byavoiding participation in the pro-ceedings before the Hague Court:fb) That the Secretary $f State forForeign Affairs should suggest tothe Court the adoption of a methodof inquiry customary in correspondingcases in this country, that is to say,that documents such, as the protocol of 1922 and the Treaty of Saint Germainshould be submitted to the Court withoutpleading, and that the Court should only ask for such further assistance as it requires .   That course, &quot;\t was felt, would provide a helpful e&amp;plana-tion to foreign countries as to thedecision not to take part in pleadings:,       - .. f .i(c) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should explain theposition to the Governments of Franceand Gzecho-Slovakia, making clear thereasons for our desire to retain a neutral and unbiassed position.

In favour of theformer course it was pointed out that a DepartmentalCommittee could be composed of persons who would consider the question purely on its merits and withoutpolitical bias., whereaa a Select Committee w-as likelyto divide on Party lines.    On the other hand it was urged that the question was already very importantpolitically and was likely to become more so in theimmediate future.    According to this view it had become too large a question for a DepartmentalCommittee and could only be dealt with by a Select-Committee.   A third view was that it would.be better-to leave matters alone and appoint no Inquiry..No decision was taken on the principle of an inquiry, but the Home Secretary was asked to considerthe question again in the light of the Cabinet disciis-sion and. to report as to what form of Inquiry hewould recommend if an Inquiry were to be decided upon.
