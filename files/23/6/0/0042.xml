The Weatern 1. IN contination of War Cabinet 419, Minute 1, the Chief ofFront, the Imperial General Staff stated that the Germans had continuedto advance. They were within 1-g miles of Soissons and 3 miles ofRheims. It appeared probable that Soissons would fall during theday. It was less certain whether the Germans would take Rheimsat present, although it was prohable that they would take it later on.So far only sixteen German divisions had been identified, hut itmight well be that more had been engaged, for during a rapidretirement it was difficult co obtain exact identification. Noinforma-tion had been received as to the number of guns lost nor as to prisoners captured, beyond the statement which had appeared in theGerman wireless to the effect that 15,000 prisoners had beentaken.It was pointed out that the Germans claim to have attacked with inferior numbers. Some uncertainty prevailed as to therelative numerical strength of the opposing forces, but it was clear in any case that the numerical superiority of the enemy was not sufficient to account for his rapid advance, which must thereforebe supposed to be due to the employment of German tanks against our front and to the use of mustard gas by the enemy all along theline.Questioned as to the depth of the enemy&apos;s advance, the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff said that the extreme depth was from16 to 17 miles, and that the average depth might be taken as half that amount. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff pointed outthe seriousness that would be occasioned by the fall of Rheims andSoissons, owing to the fact that the enemy would be enabled tomend and use the railway connecting those places, the Rheims-Soissons railway then forming a base line for further operations.The distance from Paris to these points was about 60 miles.At a later stage in the Meeting a further communique wasreceived, to the effect that the enemy was continuing to increase hisgains in the Champagne. At a late hour on the previous night hehad entered Soissons, but had been driven out by counter-attack.The junction between the IXth British Corps and the French was believed to be about Savigny-sur-Ardre. So far, 21 german divisions had been identified, but it was thought that at least 10more divisions had been engaged. Prisoners stated that the attack would be extended as far west as Noyon.Moral of the 2. Lord Milner, who had just returned from France, reportedrencl- that a serious strike had occurred at St. Etienne.   The Governmenthad managed to settle it, but the serious feature was that the strikeappeared to be entirely political, and of a pacifist nature. It was astrike to compel the Government to state their War Aims, indicating that the strikers were not in favour of continuing to fight forAlsace-Lorraine, and would be glad of peace on any moderate terms.While the strike had ended for the moment, it must not be inferredthat it would not break out again.British troops under french command.3. The Secretary of State for War said that General Petain had requested that no reference should be made in our communiques tothe British troops under his Command, as he wished to treat theoperation as one. The necessary precaution to be taken in regardto these communiques would be attended to by the british commander-in-Chief.
Submarines.4. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that H.M.S.&quot; Ouse &quot; had attacked a submarine in the vicinty of FiamboroughHead. The &quot;Ouse&quot; attempted to ram, and passed just, over theconning-tower of the submarine and dropped depth charges, withthe result that the explosions of the depth charges were followed by several other large under-water explosions.The S.S.Castle.&quot;Leasowe 5. Witll reference to War Cabinet 419, Minute 5, the First sea lord stated that, as far as had been ascertained up to the present,the losses from the steamship &quot; Leasowe Castle &quot; were : 13 military officers, 79 other ranks, 9 of the ship&apos;s company, including the captain, making a total of 101.The Euesian black sea Fleet.6. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that atelegram had been received from the naval attache at Petrogradstating that orders for the destruction of the Russian Black Sea fleethad been signed by the Soviet Government, and that the instructions were to have been despatched to Novorossisk on 27th May.It was mentioned that the Russians had refused to allow aBritish naval representative to accompany the orders for thedestruction, ou the ground that by doing so the orders might becompromised.Attention was called to telegram No. 204 from Mr. Lockhart,dated the 23rd May, 1918, in which he stated that the Germans had informed the Russians that, if the remainder of the Russian black sea Fleet would return to Sebastopol, the Germans would onlysequester the same and would return the ships to Russia afterthe war.In this connection the First Lord stated that, in regard to thevessels that had been captured by the Germans at Sebastopol, someof the light craft might by now have been sufficiently repaired toenable them to go to sea, but that the heavier craft would probablytake another month before they would be sufficiently efficient forthat purpose.With regard to the possibilities of units of the Black Sea Fleetcarrying out raids into the Mediterranean, the First Lord statedthat it was highly desirable that the question of the appointment ofthe Admiralissimo to command the whole of the Allied ships in theMediterranean and Adriatic should be definitely settled at the next meeting of the Supreme War Council (War Cabinet 415, Minute 9).Allied Intervention 7. With reference to War Cabinet 417, Minute 10, the Warin Siberia. Cabinet had before them a memorandum by Lord Robert Cecil,dated the 25th May, 1918 (Paper G.T.-4063), in regard to BaronGoto&apos;s telegram of &quot;the 19th May, 1918 (Paper G.T.-4617), asking whether our negotiations with the Soviet were likely to be successful,and, if so, whether success was desirable. As a particular case,were we to refrain from helping Semenoff for fear of quarrelling withthe Soviet ? Lord Robert Cecil had also circulated a note on allied intervention in Siberia (Paper G.T.-4083), in which he asked thatthe matter might be discussed immediately, as&quot; he feared that anyfurther delay would convey to Japan the impression of hesitationand uncertainty.The Prime Minister said that Lord Robert Cecihs note implied that the whole delay, involving the loss of four months, had been due to the action Of the British Government. He could not accept this criticism, nor admit that it was fair. He pointed out that thepolicy of the British. Government had been steadily in favour of intervention.   It had, however, been difficult to secure the necessary
support of the United States Government in the matter. At thesame time, the Japanese had said that, they would not act unlessthe Americans co-operated, and this the Americans had refused todo. On the 24th January, 1918, the Cabinet had decided on inter -vention, but the President of the United States had intimated thatwe had only acted in obedience to French pressure. On 25thFebruary (War Cabinet 353, Minute 12), the War Cabinet had requested the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to send atelegram to Lord Reading, informing him that His Majestv&apos;sGovernment viewed with favour the idea of Japanese intervention in siberia up to Cheliabinsk. On this point, however, the Japanese had replied that, while they were ready to intervene for the pro-tection of Eastern Siberia up to Irkutsk, their army of 250,000, with200,000 reserves, was not considered by their General Staff to besufficient to warrant attempting to advance as far as Cbeliabinskunless they were advancing through a friendly country with theassistance instead of the hostility of the population (telegram from lord Reading, No. 1951, dated 1st May, 1918). That might becalled the first proposal of the British Government, and it had beenthwarted by the United States Government. The second proposal was that 20,000 Czecho-Slovaks should be used as a nucleus for an expeditionary force (War Cabinet 4Li, Minute 12), but this proposal had been negatived by Al. Pichon. It did not appear clear, therefore,what more we could have done, or, what was more important, what we ought to do now.Lord Robert Cecil pointed out that though the decision to take action was on the 24th January, no effective step to induce theUnited States to move was taken till the 25th February; that atfirst the United States had not been unwilling to act, but that laterthey had gone back ; that somehow the impression had been produced in Japan that we were not determined and the Japanese hadcomplained of it ; and that the United States Government had allowedit to be known that they regarded us as not much interested in thematter, but as being driven forward by the French. At the sametime, he expressed his entire agreement with the Prime minister that the main thing now was our future action, and that criticism ofthe past was of less importance.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed with thePrime Minister that we had tried every possible means to induce thePresident of the United States to co-operate in the policy of inter-vention, but he had sheltered himself behind his military advisers.We had made our policy perfectly plain ; we had stated that we didnot propose to interfere in Russian internal affairs ; our object was directed entirely against the Germans. To this end we had alwaysworked with the de facto Government in Russia : we had workedfirst with the Czar while he was in power ; we had worked nextwith the Socialists under Kerensky ; then we had worked with theBolsheviks, and we would be prepared to work with whateversuccessors there might be to the Bolsheviks. We had backed xipSemenoff&apos; originally, and had only ordered him not to move furtherforward because our representative on the spot had warned usagainst him ; we should support Semenoff again if his advanceformed part of a big movement.Lord Milner said that the question now appeared to be whether we were to allow the attitude of the United States Government toparalyse us for ever in the case of Japanese intervention, as it had done during the past few months. It would, of course, be farpreferable that all the Allies should co-operate in intervening in siberia, but the hesitation of the United States ought not to beallowed to block the whole policy and leave the field clear for german influence to dominate over the whole of Northern Asia.He therefore suggested that the polic\r of Japanese interventionshould be pursued, even without the co-operation of the UnitedStates.
It was pointed out that the pursuance of such a policy on our part, if not very carefully handled, might lead to a snubbing fromthe Japanese and a quarrel with the Americans.On the other hand, it was argued that it was not proposed tosay to the United States : &quot;If you do not come in, we shall go ahead without you.&quot; What was proposed was, that we should urgeGeneral Foch, at the meeting of the Supreme War Council, to pointout, for the benefit of President Wilson, the supreme military necessity of intervention in Siberia, and the desirability that theUnited States should furnish a substantial force for that purpose ;if, unfortunately, the United States Government felt unable toco-operate in the work, it was still held desirable that the Japaneseshould intervene, and it was hoped that the United StatesGovernment would agree to such intervention being made.The Prime Minister said that this question was to be raised atthe forthcoming meeting of the Supreme War Council, and it was essential that he and his colleagues who were accompanying himshould go to the Council with a clearly formulated plan.The War Cabinet decided that The matter should be discussed again on the following day,Thursday, 30th May.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 29, 1918.
