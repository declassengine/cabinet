THE War Cabinet had before them, a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade with regard to the order forrationing household fuel and light (Paper G.T.-4889).Sir Albert Stanley stated that there was one correction to bemade in his memorandum. In paragraph 3, the first line after thescale, there should be added &quot;up&apos;to a maximum of 20 tons&quot; afterthe words &quot;larger houses.&quot; Sir Albert Stanley continued that thenew regulations, as proposed in his memorandum, were in reabty anextension of the Coal Rationing Order, which was applied to theLondon area last year. The new regulations would, however, applyto the whole country except Ireland, but the rationing would be on a reduced scale. The rationing of gas and electric light was also included in the order. In reply to a question as to how the new order would affect the larger houses, both in London and thecountry, Sir Albert Stanley said that this was met by taking intoconsideration the size of the rooms. A room of more than,000 cubic feet would count as two rooms, and a room of8,000 cubic feet would count as three rooms. There was also theopportunity to appeal for a special assessment.[1365-434]
Shortage of coal and MunitionsPosition.Sir Guy Calthrop said that the whole essence of rationing wasthe ability to deliver the goods. There was a shortage of20,000,000 tons of coal. It was proposed that the reduction in consumption of household coal should provide 8,000,000 tonstowards this shortage ; the reduced allowance to industries wouldprovide a large proportion, and he hoped that the remainderwould be met by increased Work on the part of the miners.There was no doubt that the proposed reduction would hit the householder very hard, but he felt confident that he would beable to supply the amount required. It might even be possibleto increase the ration towards the end of the year.The War Cabinet approved Sir Albert Stanley&apos;s proposals.2. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum byMr. Churchill (Paper G.T.-4892) regarding the munitions positionas affected by the prospective shortage of coal. Mr. Churchillrequested in liis memorandum that the matter should be referred tothe War Priorities Committee without delay,The War Cabinet approved Mr. churchill&apos;s suggestion.Increase in the 3. Sir Albert Stanle,y asked that he might be authorised to price of Coal. increase the price of coal for home consumption by 2s. (id- a ton,and the price of coal supplied to neutrals and Allies by 5s. a ton.This advance was necessitated by the increased cost of production.The opinion was expressed that perhaps the present was not anopportune moment to announce an increase in the price of coal, mview of the fact that the Coal Controller was about to meet theminersregarding anincrease in their wages.   It was thoughtthat the miners might take advantage of the increased price of coal to demand more,wages than they otherwise would have done. ,. Sir Albert Stanley said the- advance was required in order tomeet the present situation. It might be necessary later on to makea further advance, and he thought it was better to do this in two stages in preference to one big advance. He was under theimpression that the riiihers would not take advantage of. theincreased price of coal to demand higher wages, as they would not wish to increase the cost of coal to the cdnsumef.The War Cabinet approved the advance in the price of coalsuggested by Sir Albert Stanley. &apos;Financial H,ard-sKips of PublicUtilityUndertakings.4i. Tire War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandumby the President pi the Board of Trade (Paper G.T.-4S90), inwhich he stated, that, representations had. been made to him by various classes of public utility undertakings-gas, water, tramways,and electricity-that their financial circumstances had been soinjuriously affected by war conditions that it was necessary thatsome, relief should, be given to them by way of increasing their statutory powers of charge or otherwise. The ^memorandum con-tained the recommendations of a Select Committee of the House ofCommons on the subject., ....Sir Albert Stanley said that he proposed, with the approval ofthe War Cabinet,, to introduce a Bill to give effect to the recomnien-dations of the Select Committee.The War Cabinet approved ihe action the President ofBoard of Trade proposed to take, fis laid down inmem or an duin.thehis
^orse-feaoiiig. 5. With reference to AVar Cabinet 412, Minute 1, tbe WarCabinet bad under consideration a memorandum by Lord Curzon(Paper G.T.-4831) and a copy of a letter from Sir W. GrahamGreene to Sir Edward Troup (Paper G.T.-4881).Lord Curzon pointed out in his memorandum that a certainamount of criticism, mainly from the pro-racing public, had appeared in the public press, and a letter had been received fromthe Racing Emergency Committee with reference to the decisionon steeplechasing, which, on the authority of the War Cabinet, hadbeen communicated to &apos;the National Hunt Committee. A deqisiopof the War Cabinet was therefore required as to whether thereshould be any modification of the decision already announced on this subject. The memorandum also drew attention to the holding of unauthorised or &quot; flapping &quot; meetings which are being held in munition areas, and on this point Lord Curzon asked for adecision as to whether these meetings should be prohibited. lord curzon stated that he had been instructed by the War Cabinet todeal with the question of horse-racing, and that the two questions referred to in his Memorandum had now arisen. On the subject ofsteeplechasing, he was of opinion that the War Cabinet should notdepart from the decision at which it bad arrived, and pointed outthat a letter embodying this decision had already been written tothe Senior Steward of the National Hunt Committee by the Presidentof the Board of Trade, and a reply had been received accepting the stoppage of races under National Hunt Rules for the ensuing winterseason. AVith regard to the unauthorised or &quot; flapping &quot; meetings,Lord Curzon stated that it was urged very strongly that it appearedinconsistent with the AVar Cabinet decisions on the question of flatracing to limit legitimate racing and to allow unauthorised racingto go on unchecked. In this connection, Lord Curzon stated thatthe Chief Secretary for Ireland had recently spoken to him on thissubject, and that Mr. Shortt had pointed out to him that, withregard to Ireland, the question of these unauthorised meetings hadnot been raised, but that he was quite prepared to prohibit them ifit was so desired. Lord Curzon explained that the difficulty wasthat no Government department seemed willing to take upon itself the responsibility for prohibiting these meetings, but he understoodthat they Avere held under licences from the Ministry of Munitions.In reply to a question as to what constituted &quot;flapping&quot; meetings,Lord Curzon read a letter from the Earl of Jersey, the SeniorSteward of the Jockey Club, which explained that the courses onwhich these meetings were held were not licensed by the Stewardsa of the Jockey Club, and that the meetings were not under JockeyClub Rules.Mr. Barnes stated that he understood that meetings were onlyauthorised now at places where the railway facilities for essentialtraffic were not interfered with, but it was&apos;explained that the WarCabinet had authorised flat-racing to take place only at Newmarket,and that all other meetings, both under the Jocke3r Club and theNational Hunt Committee,, were prohibited.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Munitions statedthat the view of the Ministry was that, if these unauthorised meetingswere prohibited, the recreation of the workpeople would be inter-interfered with and that labour unrest might ensue.The Under-Secretary to the Home Office explained that theHome Office had no power under any Regulation or Order underthe Defence of the Realm Act to prohibit these meetings. Mr. Braceadded that the power of refusing licences for such meetings rested with the Ministry of Munitions.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) There should be no modification of the decisions already announced, either in respect of flat-racing or racingunder National Plunt Rules.
(b.) Unauthorised or &quot; flapping &quot; meetings should be prohibited,and that the Ministry of Munitions should refuse to issueany further permits for the holding of such meetingsunder D.R.R. 9b., or if in the opinion of the Law Officersof the Crown that power be insufficient, a new Defenceof the Realm Regulation should be made.Life of parliament and Preparation ofNew Register:Soldiers&apos; and sailors&apos; Votes.6. With reference to War Cabinet 424, Minute 4, the WarCabinet took note of a memorandum by the President of the LocalGovernment Board (Paper G.T.-4851) with regard to an Order inCouncil to be issued, proclaiming the areas where voting by proxyby naval and military voters was to be permitted.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.June 21, 1918.o
