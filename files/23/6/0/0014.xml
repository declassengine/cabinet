German Attack.The Western 1. The Director of  Military Intelligence reported  that the^r01^ L lu  t Germans had launched very severe attacks at 6 o&apos;clock the previous evening, on the front Wulvei&apos;ghem-Neuye-Eglise-Bailleul-Meteren,and had succeeded in capturing Bailleul and the Ravels berg Ridge.General Macdonogh stated that the enemy were now drawing close to the line of hills, and that, if further progress were made, we might probably have to retire from the northern portion of thefront. He stated that the 28th French Division was arriving in thevicinity ot Locre, and that the .133rd Division was at Fletre, in close support to our present front in that neighbourhood. There were also three French cavalry divisions in this portion of the battle area. Questioned as to whether any further reinforcements were coming, General Macdonogh replied that General Foch was ofopinion that the present attack was not a genuine one, and that thereal attack in the near future would take place to the south of Arras,between Miramont and the Ancre, where there was a concentration of trench mortars and the enemy were getting on with the railway communications and repairing more bridges over the rivers in that area.Disposition of 2. As regards the enemy offensive in the Lys area, the DirectorEnemy Divisions. 0f Military Intelligence stated that the Germans had employed 25divisions in their attack, whereas we had only been able to use 19in the same area. Among the German divisions, 3 new divisions had been identified, namely, the 117th, the Alpine Corps (whichhad come from Italy), and the 11th Bavarian Division. GeneralMacdonogh stated that the enemy had employed, in addition to the2G divisions previously mentioned, 98 divisions on the Somme front,and that there were at present 57 German divisions in thefront line in the Somme area, the length of the line beingapproximately 97 miles. They had 22 divisions in reserve on thewhole front, of which 13 or 14 were on the British front. The totalnumber of enemy divisions on the Western front was 204. Out ofthese 204 divisions, 124 had been engaged, of which 53 had twicebeen in action during the present offensive, and 10 thrice, making atotal of 187 divisions engaged at various times. General Macdonoghadded that we now had definite evidence that Austrian artillery wasbeing employed on the Western front.General Radcliffe stated that the positions on the hills were very strong, and that the enemy would probably endeavour to turn the same. The advance made by the Germans yesterday might besaid to have one advantage to us, inasmuch as it shortened our line by one mile.Russia. 3. The Director of Military Intelligence indicated on a map the advance that the Germans had made in Russia, and pointed out thatthey were drawing near the Donetz coal basin, and were 17 miles east of Ivharkof.   The Germans now had in Russia 37 divisions.The Cattegat. 4. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that a naval force, had carried out a reconnaissance into the Cattegat and were now returning. He added that, from reports in the German Press,lighting had taken place, but, except for the fact that a wirelesssignal had been received that we had taken 111 prisoners, probablyfrom enemy destroyers and trawlers, no further particulars were atpresent forthcoming.Ireland.5. The First Sea Lord reported that a German agent had landed from a submarine on the West Coast of Ireland and had been captured.   After interrogation by the naval authorities, he had been
WC 392banded over to the military to be dealt with. The man in question was a  non-commissioned  officer of the Connaught Rangers, andwas one of Casement&apos;s men.Withdrawal ofReleased Soldiersfrom Civil Life.3.4l6. With reference to War Cabinet mi, Minute 8, Lord Derbystated that (the First Lord being present) he thought this was amatter which could be arranged between the First Lord and himselfwithout troubling the War Cabinet on the subject.The GlycerinePosition.7. With reference to War Cabinet387, Minute 5, the WarCabinet had under consideration a note by Lord Curzon (paper g.T.-4204) on the glycerine position, and took note of the actionwhich Lord Curzon had taken in regard to the Ministry of Munitionsmaking representations to the Treasury, urging that the necessary facilities might be given for the erection of fat-splitting plants inCevlon and other suitable places.Anti-S ubmarineCoastal Patrols byAeroplanes.8. With reference to War Cabinet 361, -Minute 15, the WarCabinet had before them an Admiralty Memorandum (Paper.G.T.-4213) on Anti-Submarine Coastal Patrols by Aeroplanes, and took note of the same.Poison Gas:Reply to the geneva Red cross committee.Casualties.9. With reference to War Cabinet 363, Minute 7, the WarCabinet had under consideration Papers G.T.-4077 and G.T.-4220,relative to the reply to the Geneva Red Cross Committee withregard to the use of asphyxiating gases, more particularly thatportion which gave the proposed answer of the Allied Governments,as drawn up by the Military Representatives at Versailles, suchrepresentatives comprising French, Belgian, British, Italian,American, and Portuguese officials. Special reference was made tothe clause which pointed out that, in dealing with the german empire and its subordinates, no guarantee given by them would belikely to be kept, and that the possibility existed of the Germansbeing prepared to give a guarantee, with the result that we mightcease our efforts in gas production only to find that the guaranteewas broken and that we were again placed at a disadvantage in thisrespect. It was felt that, in asking for any guarantees in thismatter, it should be clearly stated that such must be of an effective and unquestionable character.Subject to this addition, the War Cabinet Approved the proposed answer as prepared by the military representatives at &quot;Versailles,and requested The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to inform the AlliedGovernments and the British Minister at Berne accordingly.10. With reference to War Cabinet 390, Minute 6, the Secretaryof State for War reported the following casualties from the 21st march to 12th April, 1918, excluding sick: Officers.        Other Ranks.Killed ... ...      1,210 12,596Wounded      ... ...      4,682 67,137Missing ... ...      2,817 68,7128,709148,445
Man-Power Bill. 11. With reference to War Cabinet 390, Minute 9, the HomeSecretary asked for the instructions of the War Cabinet as to thestatement which lie shoidd make on Clause 1 of the Man-PowerBill, in regard to any declaration, by Order in Council. He statedthat an amendment was to be proposed providing that a regulationor Order in Council should be laid on the Table, and that if within twenty-one days an address were presented to His Majesty by either house of Parliament against the enforcement of the Order it wouldthen be annulled from the date of such address.It was pointed out, on the one hand, that this procedure mightlay the Government open to an accusation of weakness, as well asto the accusation that it was not the intention of the Government tocarry the proposed legislation into effect. On the other hand, itwas generally agreed that the House of Commons resented in all quarters giving the Government power to create machinery for thepurpose of carrying into effect legislation over which the House hadno control, and that it would obviously be difficult to resist any demand made by the Bouse for such control.Questioned as to whether this procedure would make any difference with regard to the feelings of Irishmen in respect of theapplication of the Act to Ireland, the Chief Secretary expressed theopinion that the Irish population would not consider any substantialconcession had been made.It was generally agreed, however, that the parliamentary situation would be eased by this procedure.The War Cabinet agreed that The Home Secretary, when dealing with Section 1 of the Billon the Report stage in the House of Commons, should state that an Order in Council under this Bill should be laid on the Table, and that if within fourteen days an addresswere presented by either House against the Order it shouldthenceforth be annulled, but that this provision should not extend to regulations.&quot;112. With reference to War Cabinet 391, Minute II, a general discussion took place on the application of the Military Service Billto Ireland.The Chief Secretary for Ireland read to the War Cabinet variousreports which he had received on the position of affairs in Ireland.In a letter, the Head of the Royal Irish Constabulary&apos; stated that thesituation was very grave ; that the people of Ireland were unitedagainst conscription ; that it had been reported to him that thereAvere movements in force which implied that assistance could beexpected from German sources.   General Byrne had further statedthat, in his opinion, the number of troops in Ireland was whollyinadequate, and that any attempt to enforce conscription without anadequate force must inevitably lead to failure.   Another letter, fromthe Chief Commissioner of the Dublin Police, said that both theCommissioner and General Byrne took a far more serious view ofthe situation than that which was taken by the military authorities.The Chief Commissioner had stated that he understood there were only 15,000 troops in Ireland, which number was quite inadequate ;that all sections, and even some Unionists, were joined together in opposition  to conscription;   that, even given adequate military support, it would be almost impossible to enforce conscription, butthat with only 15,000 troops it was out of the question.   The letterfurther. stated that, in the opinion of the writer, the introduction ofno measure of Home Rule would assist.   Mr. Duke also producedGeneral ByrneVWeekly Report, giving particulars of meetings heldin all parts of Ireland ;  of the formation of hospitals ; of theenrolment of nurses ; and of the seizure of arms in various districts.Mr. Duke further referred to the police reports from a number of counties, which fully bore out General Byrne&apos;? Report.   Mr. Dukewas of opinion that the Nationalist Members of Parliament intendedApplication toIreland :MilitaryPrecautions.
5 WC392to abandon all Parliamentary action after the Third Reading of theBill, and to go back to Ireland and make common cause with the sinn Feiners. A meeting called by the Lord Mayor of Dublin had been  postponed until after the Third Reading of the Bill, and at thismeeting it was proposed to make preparations for the establish-ment of a revolutionary Provisional Government. There had alsobeen a meeting on Sunday last at Belfast, held at the Custom Housesteps, at which the audience was composed of all sections, includingUlstermen, when the strongest possible protests were made againstthe enforcement of the Bill on Ireland.The Prime Minister stated that the Government had come to adecision that it would stand or fall, by the Bill, not only by puttingit on the Statute Bock, but also by enforcing it, and that theGovernment was definitely pledged to introduce and to enact aHome Rule Bill for Ireland. He further pointed out that, withoutdoubt, the Military Service Bill would become an Act of parliament by Thursday.Questioned as to the views of the authorities in Ireland, Field-Marshal Lord French agreed that there were all too few troops inIreland at the present time. He was, however, emphatic in hisopinion that, if it were intended to carry conscription into effectwith the number of troops available, the action which should betaken must be of an extremely drastic character. The strength oftroops in Ireland at the present time consisted of 23 trainingbattalions and 1. mobile division of cyclists numbering 5,000 men,whilst a brigade of cyclists, to the strength of 1,o00, was being sent from Scotland. An additional force of several thousand cyclistswas also available in England for immediate despatch in case of necessity.It was pointed out that it was most undesirable that untrainedmen, who had just left civil employment, should be used to repressrebellions. The suggestion was made that some of the BritishVolunteers might be mobilised for the protection of railway bridgesand other vulnerable jwints In this connection General Smutssaid that, in the case of the South African rebellion, large numbersof armed men had been found necessary for similar services.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he was coii-vinced. that, if any rising were met promptly, it would be put down with much greater ease, and far less bloodshed, than if strongmeasures were not taken at the beginning. He was not in agreementwith the belief, which apparently existed in the South of Ireland,that help could be expected from German sources, pointing out thatthe same assistance was expected during the Easter rebellion of1910, and that it was incredible that such assistance could be givennow.The Prime Minister referred to the fact that President Lincolnhad to face an exactly similar situation, but Mr. Duke pointed outthat in the case of President Lincoln the population Avere supporting the President, while in this case the whole population of Ireland wasunited in opposition.It was generally agreed that preliminary dispositions should bemade at once in order to protect important strategical and tacticalpoints, and to guard railways and bridges.The War Cabinet recmested Field-Marshal Lord French (a.) To proceed to Ireland as soon as possible, to consult withthe Comniander-in-Chief and General Byrne as regardsall necessary military arrangements to meet anycontingency ;(b.) To lay before the War Cabinet at the earliest opportunity a plan of the military steps which he: proposed to take, ifit were necessary to employ the assistance of the mili-tary, in order to enforce the Military Service Act on[1365-392]C
Ireland. This plan should include a statement of hisrequirements (if any) for reinforcements, and suggestions as to whence these could best be obtained.Home Rule. 13. The War Cabinet proceeded  to  consider the statement which should be made in the House of Commons by the PrimeMinister on the subject of the proposed Home Rule Bill for Ireland.Attention was drawn to two telegrams, one from Lord reading and one from Mr. Montgomery, with reference to American opinionon the subject of Home Rule and the proposed application of theMilitary Service Act to Ireland, both addressed to Colonel Murray.The Prime Minister pointed out that to-day was the lastopportunity which would offer for making any declaration on thisquestion.The opinion was expressed that it might be advisable that any statement on this subject should not be made in conjunction withthe Military Service Bill, but should be postponed until thefollowing day ; but, while it was agreed that the two proposals could not be linked together, and that even the NationalistsMembers of Parliament understood that there was no question of abargain, it was considered advisable that a statement on this subject should be made on the Third Reading of the Bill. With referenceto the form that the statement should take, and the opinion of lord reading, stated in his telegram, namely, that it would be necessaryfor the Government to declare its intention not only to stake its existence on the passing of a Home Rule Bill, but also of its intention to put such an Act into operation at once, the PrimeMinister said that, not only was this the policy of the Government,but also that he had been in consultation with the representatives ofthe Labour Party, who were agreed that a declaration should bemade on such lines. Mr. Lloyd George had enquired of the labour representatives as to the attitude which they would take if all sections of the Irish were united in opposition to a Home Rule Bill,and he had been informed that it was their opinion that in that casethe Government would be absolved from further obligations. Itwas, however, the general Liberal and Labour opinion in thecountry that the Government had no right to enforce the MilitaryService Act on Ireland unless a measure of home Rule was not onlypresented- to the House of Commons, but also was supported inevery possible way by the full powers of the G-overnment.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the real difficulty which occurred to him was that there was no agreed home rule Pull, and that it could not be said that the Irish Conventionhad come to substantial agreement on certain most important points.In the general discussion which followed, the opinion was expressed that, as Sir Edward Carson had assented, when a memberof the War Cabinet, not only to the formation, but also to thecom position, of the Convention, and that as the Convention had made very valuable suggestions, there was a probability that the Ulstermenwould be prepared favourably to consider a Bill based on the reportof the Convention.With reference to the Committee presided over by Mr. Long,which was now drawing up. the draft of a Home Ride Bill, Mr. Longstated that his difficulty was that the Committee consisted of so many members, all holding important duties, that it was not possibleto meet as often as he would wish.The opinion was generally assented to that if Mr. Long would draw up the Bill himself and consult his Committee 011 certain points of difference only, a decision as to the draft Bill to be presented to the War Cabinet would be arrived at more expeditiously.The view was expressed that all the Ulster members would
dissent from any Bill framed on the Majority Report of the Conven-tion ; hnt, on the other hand, in view of the letters which had appeared in the press, and speeches made in the House of Commons,it was evident to the War Cabinet that a large number of UnionistMembers of Parliament were agreed that it was their duty to supportthe Government in passing a measure of Home Rule, provided thatsome substantial agreement could be found between the various sections of the Irish party.General agreement amongst the members present was expressed on the following points : (a.) That it should be left to the discretion of Mr. Long to use his own initiative as to the most expeditious method of drafting a Home Rule Bill for the consideration of theWar Cabinet.(b.) That the proposals in the Bill should be such as could be recommended to and would be considered fair by bothBritish and American opinion.(c.) That the Bill should, as far as ]JOssible, be based on theReport of the Irish Convention as a framework, butsubject to such modifications as should be deemed necessary in order to make it a fair and reasonableproposal as between all the parties concerned.2.
