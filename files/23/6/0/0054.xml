The Italian Front.of the Imperial General Staff explained the he stated that an Italian brigade of &quot;storm1. THE Chiefsituation on a map.troops &quot; had cut in on tbe River Piave, andthus making a breach in the Austrian lines,a very satisfactory piece of work.had reached Saletto,This appeared to beThe Western Front.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that there wasno news from the Western front, and no signs of a further attack bytbe Germans. In reply to a question as to his opinion regardingtbe delay in the German attack, the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff said that it was possible that the Germans hoped, by waiting,to make more fresh divisions available. In Prince RupprechPs armythere were 21 fresh divisions up to yesterday. General Wilson was alittle surprised at the delay, although it must be borne in mind that tomount a further attack against the French would take time. If, onthe other hand, the enemy&apos;s design was to attack the British, not somuch time would be needed. Every day that, passed was a day to thegood for us, as we should be nearer the date on which the american troops would make themselves felt. With regard to the possibilityof the Germans moving further divisions from Russia, the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff stated that they might moveanother 10, but these would be inferior divisions. He statedthat it was a hopeful sign that no German troops were taking part inthe Austrian offensive, as it would seem to indicate that the germans were afraid of straining their relations &amp;with Austria any further.There was little doubt that the Germans must be disgusted with thefailure of the Austrian offensive.The Transport&quot; Candy.&quot;3. The First Sea Lord reported that the transport &quot; Candy &quot;had been torpedoed off Bizerta, but that she was proceeding to port under her own steam. The submarine which attacked the&quot; Candy &quot; had been destroyed, and five survivors picked up.GermanyVEconomic PolicyPropaganda.4. Mr. Chamberlain called attention to an article which had appeared in the &quot; Times &quot; on the previous Saturday, with regard toGermany&apos;s economic policy. He expressed the opinion that thisarticle should be used for propaganda purposes and circulated onthe same lines as the Lichnowsky memorandum.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook to go intothe question and to ascertain whether it was possible forthe Foreign Office to take any action on Mr. chamberlain&apos;suggestion.Allied Interventionat Russian ArcticPorts: Questionof Command.5. The First Lord drew the attention of the War Cabinet to aletter from the Secretary of the Allied Naval Council, dated theloth June,  i 9IS (Paper G.T.-4857), written as aNote No. cResolution,i! 9IS (Paper G.T.-4857), written as a result of Joint., by the Military Representatives at Versailles, andso. 4 (ii), by the Supreme War Council, dated the 3rdiune, 1918. The recommendation of the Military Representativeswas that there should be a single Command with the duty ofdirecting both the defence by sea and the defence by land of theRussian ports in the Arctic Ocean. Sir Eric Geddes stated that hehad consulted Lord Milner with regard to this proposal, and he understood that the joint note did not mean that the militaryCommaiider-in-Chief should have command of naval operations inthose waters. As a result of his conversation with Lord Milner,Sir Eric Geddes expressed himself satisfied in this matter, and suggested that, as he understood it was not desired that thequestion should be again raised at the Supreme War Council, the
Strategic 6. The First Lord of the Admiralty drew the attention of the considerations. War Cabinet to the conclusion reached by the Allied Naval council at their fourth meeting, held in. London on the 11th and 12thinstant, relative to the situation at Murmansk and Archangel(Paper G.T.-4857). Sir Eric Geddes stated that, if we allowed the finns or the Germans to get a submarine base between the KolaInlet and the coast of Norway, such as Petchenza, or bafes in theWhite Sea between Kandalakasha and Onega, which latter could beused by both submarines and patrol vessels, it would be quite impossible to safeguard traffic to Murmansk and Archangel. he pointed out that we had received information that there was a forceof Finns congregating with a view to advancing on Petchenza,and that there was an unknown force in the South, with lightrailway appliances, preparing to advance on Kandalakasha.Further, that the enemy were building barracks for 12,000 men,and motor-boats were being assembled on Lake Ladoga. it therefore became a question as to what was the policy of theWar Cabinet with regard to the defence of Murmansk and Archangeland the adjoining provinces. Owing to climatic conditions, it was essential that, if these places were to be held effectively, the neces-sary troops must be available on the spot within about the next twomonths, and, if this was to be done, it would necessitate taking awaysome of the anti-submarine forces, and utilising them in the Arcticfor the protection of transports and supplies. It was therefore aquestion of whether the advantage of holding these ports, &amp;c, wasnot outweighed by the additional losses in merchant-ships that wouldresult from the withdrawal of the anti-submarine forces from theirpresent duties. Sir Eric Geddes further pointed out that, if weallowed the Germans to establish a base at Petchenza, it would bevery difficult to drive them out again.As regards the force required effectively to hold the district inquestion, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that ho was going into the matter, and his preliminary investigations were to theeffect that two and a half divisions of infantry alone would be required.As soon as he had completed his estimate he proposed to send it into the Admiralty for consideration as regards the naval questions involved. He was inclined to think that, unless the occupation ofMurmansk and Archangel was backed up by intervention throughSiberia, it might be desirable to abandon the Murman coast.The Prime Minister hoped that the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff wotdd, however, consider that, although it might be impossiblefor operations to take place through Siberia, it was possible that russia might be in existence in 1919, in which case Archangel and murmansk would be invaluable as inlets to Russia ; hence it was essential to maintain our position there if such could be achieved without the expenditure of large forces.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff continued to the effectthat he had just received a reply that the despatch of the Americanbrigade to Murmansk was still under consideration, and he under-stood the reason why the matter had not already been settled wasthat the American Government wanted to know General FoclFsviews on the subject.[1365---432J B 2Secretary of State for War should write him a letter explainingfully the orders given to General Poole. as far as they relate to hisnon-interference in naval control afloat.The War Cabinet approved this proposal.The First Lord undertook to bring the letter to the notice ofthe Allied Naval Council, and to use his best endeavours to induce the Council to accept this letter as a final solution of the question.
Lord Milner added that the Americans had already been toldwhat General Foch recommended.The War Cabinet decided that The War Office should put forward a statement of the whole problem to General Boole, and ask him for an estimate ofthe force which he considers necessary in order, to holdPetchenza, Murmansk, Archangel, and the Western shoresof the White Sea. In telegraphing the same, he shouldalso be invited to express his views on the subjectgenerally.Holland : Despatch 7. With reference to War Cabinet 427, Minute 9, the Secretarvof Convoy to Dutch   of state for F01.e]-gn Affairs informed the War Cabinet that, in spite-  Indles- of the fact that the Dutch Government had assented to all the views expressed by the British Government on the subject of the despatchof a convoy from Holland to the Dutch East Indies, the pledgeswhich had been given had not been carried out, in so far as the listof passengers sailing had not been shown, the convoy was carryinggoods of German origin in the form of aniline dyes, and there were other points of difference. The Dutch Government had consented to put off the sailing of the convoy for twenty-four hours, andMr. Balfour expressed the hope that these troubles would besmoothed over, and that the pledges given would be carried out.Mr. Balfour pointed out that it was essential for the BritishGovernment to maintain its right of search if the agreement of theDutch Government was not carried out, as on this right dependedthe whole continuation of any blockade against Germany. If we gave up this right in one case it would be difficult to see how itwould be possible to enforce it in the case of other neutral countries.Mr. Balfour said that a decision on this subject must be taken withinthe next few hours.The First Sea Lord said that the view of the Admiralty was&apos; that, if the Dutch convoy sailed without fulfilling the necessaryobligations, the procedure would be to take the necessary steps to stop the convoy and to bring the ships into harbour to be searched.Mr. Balfour called attention to a telegram from the ForeignOffice to Sir W. Townley (No. 1307), which gave a full statement ofthe conditions which were to be observed by the Dutch Governmentin regard to the sailing of the convoy, calling particular attention to paragraph (F), which stated that the convoy was not to sail until allthe stipulated particulars and undertakings had been furnished andhad been found satisfactory by the British authorities.In this connection Admiral Wemyss said that the admiralty were satisfied that the paragraph referred to had not been complied with. Admiral Wemyss referred to telegram No. 2221 from Sir W.Townley, in which it was stated that the manifests, which should now be in the possession of the Foreign Office, would show thatthere were considerable quantities of aniline dyes on board, pre-suinably of enemy origin, and that he was not aware that condition (F)had been fulfilled.Mr. Chamberlain referred to a further telegram from the ForeignOffice to Sir W. Townley, dated the 18th June, 1918 (No. 1410),which drew attention to the non-fulfilment of the various conditions,and expressed the hope that it should be clearly understood that the convoy should not sail until all these points had been fully met inaccordance with the understanding now arrived at.General Smuts expressed the opinion that the British Govern-ment would be made ridiculous if it went to war with Holland oversome of the points mentioned in the foregoing telegram, and instancedthe use of German cral by the ships of the convoy. It was, accordingto all military advice, of the highest interest that Holland should bekept out of the war. It must be assumed that as Holland had accepted our conditions she would abide by her undertaking, but ifwar had to come with Holland it must come only on a perfectly
clear issue.   Such, a clear issue would be raised if the convoy sailedbefore condition (F) was complied with.The Cabinet agreed with these views.The Director of Military Intelligence said that the question ofthe passengers carried was one of very great importance-- He pointedout that the Dutch Indies were a centre of considerable german propaganda, with tire object of spreading sedition in India, and,although the General Officer Commanding at Singapore had done agreat deal to stamp out German influence, it was still a centre ofsedition, and it was most important that, no fresh German agentsshould be allowed to go there.During the discussion which ensued, it was suggested that incase the convoy sailed without condition (F) having been fulfilled, itmight be desirable to seize the collier accompanying the convoy.But it was pointed out that this.wouk.1 not be sufficient, as the convoy might obtain sufficient coal in neutral ports to proceed asfar as Cape Town, and its detention there would be very undesirable.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should instruct sir William Townley to inform the Dutch Governmentthat it was essential that the convoy should not sail untilcondition (F) had been complied with, namely, that the convoy was not to sail until the stipulated particulars andundertakings had been furnished and had been foundsatisfactory by the British authorities. Sir AVilliamTownley should be informed that the Government didnot think it in the public interest to forbid the use ofGerman coal by the convoy, hut it was essential thatthey should be satisfied that there were no passengerson board to whom exception could be taken, and nogoods of enemy origin.(&amp;.) In the event of the Dutch convoy sailing before the BritishGovernment were so satisfied, the Admiralty should beauthorised to take action to intercept the convoy.Proposed Visit of 8. With reference to the information which had been receivedM. Troelstra to that M. Troelstra intended to come to England, the Director ofEngland. Military Intelligence was asked to   give  the AVar Cabinet   any information which was available about him.General Macdonogh said that, from information which he hadreceived from The Hague, M. Troelstra often frequented-the GermanLegation at The Hague, more particularly at the time of the politicaltension between Holland and Germany. For this he had beenpublicly reproached in the Dutch Parliament. It was certain, also,that M. Troelstra exercised considerable influence in the direction ofsecuring the acceptance of German demands. General Macdonoghsaid, that the French Minister at The Hague considered him a very dangerous man, and called attention to a telegram received fromFord Derby the previous day, which stated that the French Govern-ment would not allow M. Troelstra to come to France. GeneralMacdonogh pointed out that M. Troelstra was in Berlin before the stockholm Conference, and at the Conference he had opposed any discussion of the origin of the war, after consultation with hisGerman friends. According to the information available,M. Troelstra was all in favour of a German peace.Attention was called to telegram bio. 2144 from Sir AV. Townfey,which stated that M. Troelstra had invited Herr Scheidemann tomeet him at been warden, and that two Austrian Socialists were alsocoming from ATenna to be present at the meeting.It was pointed out that Air. Havelock Wilson had, on behalf ofthe SeameFs and Firemen&apos;s Union, refused to convey M. Troelstra
to England, but the opinion was expressed that if he could not get to the United Kingdom on a British ship he would probably find some other way, e.g., by obtaining permission to sail in a Dutchhospital ship.The opinion was expressed that it was most inadvisable that aman with known German connections should be allowed to come tothis country. The French Government had refused to allow him togo to France, and if we allowed him entry into England the criticism would be made that the Allies were pursuing differentpolicies.Mr. Barnes said that, on the other hand, there were twoarguments &apos; for allowing M. Troelstra to come to England. Thefirst was that M. Huysman was here now, and the second was thatMr. Arthur Henderson would have a great grievance if M. Troelstrawere refused entry.General Smuts pointed out that M. Troelstra had had an interview with Herr Scheidemann on the subject of terms of peace,and he would be coming here with the authority of the GermanSocialists and speaking for the enemy. If he were allowed to come here with a long list of terms from Germany, it was obvious that only trouble could ensue.The War Cabinet decided that A permit should not be issued to M. Troelstra to land in GreatBritain.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 19, 1918.o
