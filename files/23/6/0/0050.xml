The western front.1. THE Director of Military Intelligence stated that there wasno further news from France, except that there was considerableaerial activity and a certain amount of movement on the Hlrd french army front north of the Aisne. No definite report had yet beenreceived as to the result of the enemy attack yesterday south-west of Ste. Euphraise.German Reserves.2. The Director of Military Intelligence stated that PrinceRupprecht&apos;s reserves were still intact. One German division had,however, been moved from near Bruges to a point in rear of the  Mont Rouge-Sherpenberg front. There was also evidencethat a number of hospitals, &amp;c, had been moved to Lille, whichrather indicated that we might expect a small attack on the Lysfront. General Macdonogh said that a heavy attack on theMontdidier-Noyon front was in preparation.German Claims.3. The Director of Military Intelligence stated that, accordingto the German wireless, the Germans claimed the following amountof prisoners and booty : 55,000 prisoners.650 guns.2,000 machine-guns.2,000,000 heavy shell.They also estimated that the Allied casualties were between200,000 and 250,000. They stated that their own casualties hadbeen exceptionally small.According to captured German orders, the objective given tothe German divisions in the recent battle was the line of the Marneand. the destruction of the Entente armies and their communications.German Tanks.The Italian Front.Dutch hospital ship Sunk.4. With reference to War Cabinet 410, Minute 1, the Directorof Military Intelligence showred to the War Cabinet a picture of aGerman tank. He stated that it was not such an effective weaponas our own tank, owing to the fact that it could not. climb a4-foot bank or cross an 8-foot ditch. The Germans in theirwireless had stated that they had used captured British tanks onthe Aisne with good results.5. The Director of Military Intelligence stated that the expected attack on the Italian front on the 6th June had notmaterialised. There were signs, however, of preparations for anAustrian attack on the Piave.6. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that the Dutch hospital ship &quot; Koningin Regentes&quot; had been sunk at 1T5 yesterday-afternoon, 20 miles east of the Lemon Bank Lightship. Fourfiremen had been drowned, but the reinaiuder had been saved.Admiral Hope said that a report had appeared in the press that theBritish delegates going to Holland to negotiate an exchange ofprisoners were on board this boat. This was incorrect, as the delegates were on board the &quot; Sindoro.&quot;Submarines.
American Military 9. Attention was drawn  to  telegram No. 2535, dated  theAssistance : 5th June, 1918, which had been received from Lord Reading.Man-Power. The Prime Minister read an extract as follows : &quot; M. Jusserand being anxious to receive a formal assur-ance from the President as to the 100 divisions of Americanstrength put the point to him, Mr. Wilson replied that notonly did this figure not frighten him, but that if necessaryit would be exceeded. President added, however, in thisconnection that two points should be considered. First, inview of effort which the three Allied Governments weredemanding of United States it would be necessary that eachof them should examine its military potentialities, and informUnited States Government that number of combatants furnishedwas really the maximum possible. It might in certaincircumstances, President said, be useful to communicate sucha declaration to Congress, and even if need be to american public to meet possible criticism.&quot;It was suggested that the matter should be referred to theMinister of National Service, in order that he might frame a state-ment on the subject, to be considered by the War Cabinet; or, onthe other hand, we might afford the American Government thesame facilities for investigating the position of our man-power aswe were according the French Government (War Cabinet 426,Minute 6). ft was pointed out, however, that, if we informed theUnited States Government that the French were enquiring into thestate of our man-power, it might convey the impression that theFrench were suspucious that we were not making full use of our resources.Attention was drawn to the fact.that Sir Auckland geddes hadalready collected from the different Departments the material for afull statement as to the utilisation of British man-power, and thatthis might be of assistance when replying to Lord Reading&apos;telegram.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, after consulting theMinister of National Service, should supply to LordBeading a full statement of our man-power figures, and say that the French Government Avere already sending arepresentative to examine our figures, and, should the&apos; American GoA^ernment so desire, we would afford themsimilar facilities.Imperial War 10. With reference to War Cabinet 411, Minute .18, the WarCabinet: Cabinet had before them the Report (Paper G.T.-4742) of LordAgenda. Curzon&apos;s  Committee, Avhich  had   been  appointed  to  draw upProvisional Agenda for the forthcoming meetings of the imperial war Cabinet.It was agreed that it would probably be impossible to adhereAir Attack on 8. With reference to War Cabinet 427, Minute 3, AdmiralDunkirk. Hope reported that, during the air attack on Dunkirk on the night of the 5th-6th June, over 300 hornbs were dropped by about 25enemy aircraft. Several of our aerodromes were bombed, and aconsiderable number of our aeroplanes were damaged. This didnot, however, prevent our aeroplanes from Dunkirk undertaking a raid on Zeebrugge on the night of the 5th-6th instant, when 6^ tonsof bombs were dropped on Zeebrugge Lock Gate, the BrugeoiseWorks, Bruges Dock, Bruges Canal, Ghistelles Aerodrome, andMarialter Aerodrome.
absolutely to any cut-anrl-dried programme, but that the Com-mittee&apos;s recommendations might usefully be followed so far as might prove practicable.The War Cabinet decided that  (a.) The first meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet should beheld at 10, Downing Street, on Tuesday next, 11th June,1918, at 11-30 a.m.The Secretary was instructed to issue the necessaryinvitations.(??.) At the first meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet theprocedure adopted at the previous Session should befollowed, viz. : That the Prime Minister should make astatement surveying the past year&apos;s effort, and giving ageneral outline of bis views as to the future, and thathis review should be followed by general statements bythe Dominion Premiers and the Secretaries of State forthe Colonies and India.(c.) At the second meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet theSecretary of Slate for Foreign Affairs should make ageneral statement upon foreign policy.(d.) The Imperial War Cabinet should ordinarily meet on themornings of Tuesday and Thursday in each week,Friday afternoou being reserved for a third meeting ifthis should be found to be necessary or desirable.(e.) The first meeting should take place on the 11th instant,whether or not the whole of the Dominion PrimeMinisters had arrived in England.Passports for 11. &quot;With reference to War Cabinet 389, Minute 13, the WarIndian Home Eule Cabinet had under consideration a Minute from Lord Islington toDelegates. the Prime Minister (Paper G.T.-4190) on the subject of the cancellation-tion of passports granted by the Government of India to Mr. Tilakand other Home Pule delegates who were proceeding to the UnitedKingdom for the purpose of holding public meetings and conductinga political agitation in support of the Indian Home Pule movement.When the matter had been brought up before the War Cabineton the 11th April, 1918, they had decided that Mr. TilaFs party should not be permitted to proceed.The Secretary of State for India said that he had no intentionof asking the Cabinet to reverse this decision. There was, however,another question involved. The action of the Cabinet had stoppedthe progress of the libel action which Mr. Tilak had brought against Sir Valentine Chirol,, and the India Office had receivedletters from the solicitors of both parties, representing the incon-venience caused by further- postponement of the hearing of the case.Mr. Montagu said that he proposed to reply to Mr. Tilak&apos;s solicitorsin the following sense : &quot; With reference to the first paragraph of your letter, Iam to say that your client must be under some misapprehension.The enclosure of my letter of the 8th May will have made itclear to you that the decision which led to the cancellation ofthe passports of Mr. Tilak and other Home Pule delegates wasthe act of Plis Majesty&apos;s Government, and that no question ofpermitting Mr. Tilak to proceed to this country for the purposeof prosecuting his suit in the Courts is pending in this Office.AVith regard to the inconvenience and possible injury whichmay accrue to your client from further postponement of the hearing, I am to say that he has only himself to thank. had he strictly confined his journey to the one object of proceeding with the suit, and had he made clear his intention of abstain-ing from political agitation, his movements would not havebeen interfered with.&quot;
Commissions for 12. With reference to War Cabinet 400, Minute 13, the WarIndians. Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor India (Paper G.T.-4001), and a note by Lord Curzon (paper g.T.-4752).The War Cabinet decided  To postpone the discussion on this subject until the Secretaryof State for War and the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff could be present.Indian Reforms. IS. With reference to War Cabinet 417, Minute 2, the WarCabinet had under consideration a Report by the Secretary of Statefor India and the Viceroy, with a covering note by the Secretary ofState (Paper 112-D), and a note by Lord Curzon on the above JointReport (Paper 113-D), (Appendix).The Secretary of State for India said that he would preface his remarks by a brief reference to the degree of support which theproposals of the Viceroy and himself might expect to receive. Hehad circulated to the Cabinet a letter signed by his colleagues from england, Lord Donoughmore, Sir William Duke, and Mr. CharlesRoberts, M.P., and also by Mr. Bhupendranath Basu, which statedthat the signatories unitedly support the recommendations made inthe Report, and were prepared to recommend their adoption to public opinion both in England and India. He had also circu-lated a despatch from the Government of India which statedthat, although this most important document represented viewsfor which the signatories thereto were alone responsible, theIndian Government desired to record the fact that it was framedafter prolonged discussion with them. They added that they werenot unanimous in regard to all the detailed recommendations, butthey washed to convey their cordial support to the general policywhich the Report embodies. Mr. Montagu attached importanceto the fact that Sir Sankaran Nair, the Indian member ofLord Chelmsford&apos;s Council, was in general agreement with theproposals. Further, his own Council at the India Office (with theexception of Sir Arnold White, who was absent from illness, and whose views he had consequently not been able to obtain) unanimouslysupported the policy advocated in the Report, reserving considerationof details, in reply to a question by Lord Curzon as to whethersupport of the policy meant was support of the general principles onwhich it was founded or of the proposals for carrying them out, Mr.Montagu said that it applied to both.   As regards the Viceroy&apos;sAfter some discussion the War Cabinet decided that (a.) Mr. Tilak should be permitted to proceed to. the UnitedKingdom for the sole purpose of prosecuting his libelaction.(6.) No Indian Home Rule delegates should be permitted toproceed with him, and that he should be accompaniedby his solicitor only.(c.) Before being permitted to proceed, Mr. Tilak should give an undertaking, on behalf both of himself and hissolicitor, that during their stay in the United Kingdomneither of them would take part in propaganda work ofany kind whatsoever ;(d.) Mr. Tilak and his solicitor should undertake to return toIndia immediately after the conclusion of the legal proceedings.The Secretary of State for India was recpiested totake the necessary action.
Council, two members, Sir William Vincent and Sir S. Nair, haddissented in respect of two points hot of principle. The firstdoubted whether the Grand Committees in the Provinces were,numerically, rightly proportioned ; and the second questioned the wording of the formula the Government of the Provinces could usein carrying the budget for renewed subjects. Mr. Montagusaid that he therefore claimed that both the Government ofIndia and his own Council at the India Office were in favour ofcarrying out the policy suggested in the Report. Both the viceroy and himself fully realised the enormous responsibility resting uponthemselves, and the overwhelming difficulties which confronted themThey had both, however, been gratified by the unexpected authori-tative backing which that policy had received, and by the general desire shown to progress towards the goal, indicated in the pro-pronouncement in the House of Commons on the 20th August, 1917, onthe lines laid down by the Viceroy and himself. He had read the memoranda by Lord Curzon and Mr. Chamberlain, and he was ingeneral agreement with the latter, and would be quite satisfiedshould the Government endorse the lattePs recommendation, subjectto two provisos :  (a.) That positive principles should be put first.(6.) That the wording should be slightly altered.He suggested that the Report should be published with the followingannouncement: &quot; The Government publish the Report, in accordance withthe decision which the Secretary of State was authorisedto make, for criticism in England and India. In publishingit the Government state that they generally and provisionallyaccept the policy embodied in the Report, and will embodytheir own proposals in a Bill after they have had the advantageof considering the criticisms which they now invite.Mr. Montagu cited the case of the Morley-Minto proposals in 1909,which had been published as a Parliamentary Paper for criticism,before they had been discussed in Parliament. He agreed with lord Curzon that the Report should run the gauntlet of public criticism before any attempt at legislation was made. He welcomedsuch criticism, and agreed that the Cabinet should not settleanything definitely until the public had had   time and. opportunityto discuss and. criticise the proposals of the Viceroy and himself.He hoped, however, that, in sanctioning the publication, the cabinet would not impose any conditions to the effect that neither theViceroy nor himself should have any power to make statements orexplanations to meet such criticisms as might be offered, as theresponsibility of the Report rested upon himself and LordChelmsford, and not upon the Cabinet. In reply to a question as towhether he and the Viceroy wished from time to time to makedefensive and explanatory speeches, Mr. Montagu said they wishedto be empowered to use their&apos;discretion. The Report embodied thepolicy of the Viceroy and himself, and it would be difficult for theformer, in particular, to sit still under criticism and objectionswithout replying to them. As regards details, apart from generalpolicy, these were, of course, subject to modification, and theViceroy and he wotdd gladly modify them, as useful and instructivecriticism might show to be desirable. The Viceroy would constantlybe receiving deputations, and he could send to the India Office allsuggestions which he regarded as valuable. It would be easy forthe Government to make it clear, when publishing the Report, thatthey did not as yet commit themselves absolutely to the policytherein advocated. He suggested that, after publication, a debate on the Report in each Plouse of Parliament would be required.Further discussions could then be postponed until the Bill itself was introduced.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said, with reference to theformula which the Secretary of State for India had suggested should accompany the publication by the Government of the Report, thathe thought whatever formula was adopted it should be one whichwould least commit the Government to early legislation. he himself suggested the following alternative : &quot; The Government think it right to publish this Report,which is intended to carry out the policy announced on the20th August, 1917, before they have -themselves had time toexamine it, in order that, prior to coming to a final decision,they may have the advantage of considering the views andcriticisms which they now invite.&quot;The Secretary of State for the Colonies enquired when thepublication would take place. This particularly affected his department, as it was certain that Ceylon and other parts of theDominions would put forward demands for similar treatment. Hesuggested that, before publication, the Secretary of State for india should get certain people of prominence and leading, who would besure to array themselves against the proposals put forward in theReport, to come and see him personally, so that he could explainthose proposals and meet his critics in advance. There were many who had either a commercial or a sentimental interest in India whowould be sore to range themselves on the side of the critics. If theGovernment decided on the immediate publication of the Report,they could easily say that the Report had only been in their handsa week, and that India would hardly expect them to act on it atonce. He himself, however, deprecated an early and prematurepublication. In his view, the Government could hardly publish anddisavow responsibility. The Secretaiy of State for India was already committed to the policy advocated in the Report, and it would be anew departure for the Government to publish the Report and, later,to dissociate themselves from the views put forward in it. Heconfessed he was alarmed at the position in which the government might shortly find themselves. The Report recommended a startlingchange of policy &quot;which the Government had not yet had timeto examine. Were they, at the most critical moment in the Empire&apos;shistory, deliberately to add to their existing difficulties ? In sayingthis, he especially referred to coming trouble in Ireland.The Secretary of State tor Foreign Affairs suggested that thepublication of the Report might be accompanied by an announce-ment in Parliament on the following lines : &quot; The Government publish the Report in accordance withthe decision which the Secretary of State for India was authorised to make. In publishing it, the Government desireto state that, in their view, the Report is in conformity with the declaration of the 20th August, 1917; and, after it hasbeen fully examined by them and has received the advantageof public criticism in this country and in India, will serve asthe foundation of the legislation they propose to introduce.&quot;Lord Ourzon said that he knew the Cabinet fully appreciated the great difficulties with which the Secretaiy of State for India had had to contend, and the thoroughness and. ability with which hehad examined the welter of advice that had been offered him.They also recognised the -weight of authority which he had showni0 I^fekind scheme, but he thought that, before the Report waspwrf&amp;ielied, the Government should be satisfied that the policy itrecommended would command general approval. The Reportadvocated profound, vital, and revolutionary changes, and upon these the opinion of both the local Governments in India andof this country, and of both Houses of Parliament, none ofwhich had  been ascertained,  were   desirable.     He   deprecated
the idea, at this stage, of committing the Government to any-general support of the scheme. Later on they might think thatthe policy suggested was on the right lines, but a sustainedexamination and a more ample discussion were necessary before theGovernment could arrive at any decision, lie had good reason for believing that the scheme would be strongly opposed at home. Theattitude of both blouses was uncertain as it was, and in the House ofLords therewere m an y ex-Governors of Indian Provinces, who would beforemost among the critics. If he were asked in Parliament whetherthis publication involved any acceptance at this stage by the Govern-ment of the scheme, he must ask that he should be empowered tosay that it did not. A revolutionary policy of this magnituderequired the fullest deliberation by the Cabinet. As regards theformula which should accompany the publication of the Report, he attached much importance to the form which it would take. TheIndian mind was prone to dissect phrases and to examine very-minutely every word of a Government Proclamation. Before theSecretary of State for India made any such statement as had beensuggested by Mr. Chamberlain, if indeed any such were made at all,he thought that it should be submitted in its draft form to the Cabinet.He warned the Government against committing themselves to this new scheme, even, in principle, until they had heard the criticismswhich it would be sure to iayoke. He was quite unable to agreeto the formula propounded by the Foreign Secretary. Pie himselfdid not think it was necessary to make any restatement of principleat this stage. In his-view, there was no need for the Governmentto go beyond their pronouncement of the 20th August, last year.They had then made a broad statement of policy ; they had saidthat they were sending out the Secretary of State for India on a mission to that country to give them his advice ; and the pledgesthey had given on that occasion they were faithfully carrying out.He confessed himself to be frankly opposed to any fresh declara-tion of policy on the part of the Government until they knew whatthe views of the public were and had made up their own minds. Amidway declaration of policy would only revive old controversies,and it would be asked if the Government had receded from orprogressed beyond their pronouncement of last August. He hoped the Cabinet would guard against committing themselves to anyappearance of approving a policy which they had not examined.The Report, he understood, could be published before the end ofthe present month. During the next three months the publicmust he given the oxyportunity of examining the project. The time would then come for the Cabinet to make up their mind. In anycase, there was no chance of legislation being passed before theend of the year.Air. Chamberlain, speaking as a former Secretary of State forIndia, said that lie was in favour of some declaration on the part ofthe Government to accompany the publication of the Report. Hethought that such a declaration was necessary : first, in order to reassure moderate Indian opinion and to make it clear to all classesof opinion that there would be no receding from the pronouncementof the 20th August; and, secondly, to fix with at least equalclearness the limits beyond which His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldnot permit the present measure of reform to go. His views were before the Cabinet in the paper which he had circulated(Paper 114-D), (Appendix). While he was reluctant to do anything which would indicate general approval of the new scheme on thepart of the Government, he would go a little further than thedeclaration of the 20th August, 1917. The Cabinet might againstate that the eventual goal was responsible self-government; that immediate steps along that path were being carefully considered and would shortly be taken ; and that the British Government must remain the final judge of the time and the rate of progress. Hethought that the Government might state certain broad features of
14. With reference to War Cabinet 411, Minute 2, and WarCabinet 415, Minute 15, regarding supply and regulation for ship-yard labour and mobility of munitions labour, the War Cabinet took note of the decision arrived at by the War Priorities Committee, ascirculated in Paper G.T.-4733.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.,June 7, 1918.Shipyard Labour:Supply and regulation.the method by which they proposed to give effect to their pro-pronouncement of last year. They could give a rather clearer andampler indication of what reforms they thought it necessary tocarry out. They must remember that any declaration by theGovernment carried enormous weight in India. In stating that hethought that it was necessary clearly to fix the limits beyond whichthe Government would not j)erniit the present measure to go, hehad in his mind extreme partisans of Home Rule for India. In anycase it was desirable to let the out-and-out opponents of the Govern-ment&apos;s new policy know that the Cabinet had no intention of going back upon their pronouncement of last year. He thought that, onthe occasion of publishing the Report, the opportunity should be seized of reaffirming the principles then laid down. He suggestedthat the drafting of the expository statement in Parliament mightbe left to Mr. Montagu and himself. The Report was known to bein existence. If the Cabinet held up the Report and devoted them-selves to a thorough examination of it, they could produce a scheme.On the other hand, if they postponed the publication they would be confronted with violent expressions of dissatisfaction in India.The Secretary of State for India reminded the Cabinet that, intheir pronouncement the previous August, it had been statedthat &quot; Ample opportunity will be afforded for public, discussionof the proposals which will be submitted in due course toParliament.&quot;He suggested that he should arrange that a question should beasked in the House of Commons regarding the date of publication,and that he should draft a reply for the Cabinet&apos;s approval. he further requested that sanction of the Cabinet to the publication ofthe pertinent despatches simultaneously with the Report.The Minister of Education recalled that, in the case of thereport of the Public Services Commission, great public indignationhad been caused by the withholding of publication for two years.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) In view of a question being asked in the House ofCommons at an early date regarding the publication ofa joint report, the Secretary of State for India, inconsultation with Mr. Chamberlain, should prepare adraft reply, on the lines suggested by the Chancellorof the. Exchequer, which should be submitted to theWar Cabinet for their approval;(b.) All pertinent despatches should be published simultaneously with the Report.
APPENDIX (Minute 14).112-D. -Indian Reforms,I. Note by Mr. Montagu.I PRESENT to the Cabinet the results of my mission to India in the form of theaccompanying report* by the Viceroy and myself. Our joint signatures show that weworked in harmony, and are in agreement in our proposals.2. We have tried to make our report a self-contained document. It first reviewsthe growth of the existing system of government in India and the political and social conditions in which the task of reconstruction must be undertaken. AVe should nothave attempted to set these matters before the Cabinet at a time when the calls upon their energies are so heavy but for our strong feeling that they were really essentialto our purpose if the difficulties of revising the machinery of government in India wereto be understood. It was necessary to show (.1) that there was a definite problembefore us ; (2) that the problem was the outcome of past policy ; (3) that a new departure was needed ; (4) that while past history and present conditions alike madeadvance necessary, they also imposed some limitations to the extent and character ofthe advance ; (5) that the suggestions most popular in India could not be recommended.Chapters I, II, and III, IV and V, VI and VII deal roughly with these five points.3. The stages by which we arrived at our own conclusions may be summarised asfollows : AA7e received deputations representing every kind of political views, and gavehundreds of interviews to representative men ; there were discussions with individualHeads of Provinces, constant meetings between myself and my colleagues, and numerous conferences between us and the Covernment of India. AA^e had a week&apos;conference with the Heads of Provinces collectively ; and the Viceroy and I also had aconference with representative Indian Princes regarding the matters which affect them.Whenever there was a divergence of view between us and any members of the Govern-ment of India, we set up a joint committee to deal with it. On minor points our proposals took final shape in personal discussion between the Viceroy and myself.4. Being both convinced that the main defect in the existing system w^as the factthat it denied responsibility to Indians, and being equally convinced that the time wasnot ripe for complete self-government, we speedily realised that the problem was tofind some way of giving responsibility in certain matters while reserving it in others,and to provide some means of periodically and deliberately enlarging the sphere made over to responsible control. We rejected the Congress League Scheme which foundgeneral support, among Indian politicians because it would be unworkable and lead todeadlock (Sections .1 74 177). Nor could we adopt alternative schemes (presented tous in different forms, both in Calcutta and the United Provinces), because, though theywere based on. our own principles of a temporary division of the functions of govern-ment, they were unacceptable because they held out no prospect of satisfying indian opinion. They were in some respects retrograde, and in their more ambitious formthey involved drastic and unpopular geographical redistributions (Sections 242-243).Our own conclusion was that the provinces were the right areas in which to begin the progressive realisation of responsible government. Anything smaller was too small;the Government of India, on the other hand, was concerned with the supreme interestsof the country and was not the right sphere in which to initiate constitutional changes. &apos;5. I may now summarise very briefly our cardinal proposals : (1.) In the Provinces some responsibility should be given at once. Pending thedevelopment of an electorate, responsibility cannot be given in vitalmatters. Therefore we must amend the constitution so as to transfer to indians the control of some provincial matters while reserving others(Sections 212, 2.13, 238, 240).* War Cabinet Paper 112-D.
(2.) The Government of India must, for the time being, remain responsible toParliament only, and therefore capable of imposing its will in essentialmatters, but it should be simultaneously given a legislative assembly far. more representative of Indian opinion than the present Legislative Council.These two objects can only be achieved by instituting a bicameral systemsuch as may develop hereafter into a full parliamentary constitution(Sections 276, 277).(3.) Expedients such as we propose cannot be permanent, and must be recognised as transitional ; and machinery must be provided to ensure, as fitness isdemonstrated, the considered and orderly enlargement of the popularelement in the Government (Sections 260-264, 288).(4.) While Parliament&apos;s control should be relaxed in detail, means shouldsimultaneously be found to make it better informed and more real(Sections 291-295).(5.) The door should be opened to the closer ultimate relations of the NativeStates with British India (Sections 305-312).These are the fundamental proposals. But I attach great importance also to making local self-government a reality (Sections 192-197), increasing the number of indians in the public services (Sections 313-317) and granting military commissions(Section 330).6. Now as to the degree of support which our proposals may be expected toreceive. I attach in the first place a joint letter1 signed by my colleagues from england and Mr. Basu, which speaks for itself. I attach also a copy of a despatch2which is on its way from the Government of India. I shall be surprised if thedivergence of view on points of detail which is mentioned proves to relate to any ofour five fundamental points, or embraces more than a small minority of LordChelmsford&apos;s Council. On points of detail in a matter of such complexity it was notto be expected that men of very different views would all see alike.7. As regards Local Governments, I have already stated that we conferred bothindividually and collectively with Heads of Provinces. But time did not allow us toplace our final proposals before them. I am expressing, therefore, only my personal opinion when I say that I believe that our proposals will have the adherence of themajority of the eight Local Governments to whom they are intended to apply.8. As regards Indian opinion, I am hopeful of receiving considerable support from sober and moderate men. No scheme which the British Government could bring before Parliament could satisfy those who are radically opposed to British ride, whosehostility must therefore in any case be expected. But judging from candidconversations which I have had with responsible politicians, and in which I have freelyexpressed my ideas, I believe that, provided we take action promptly, we shall securewidespread support. Sober opinion is growing tired of the excesses and impracticableutterances of the more violent party, and will welcome genuine reforms srrch as weoiler them by constituting the Provincial Governments with a strong popular element,by providing machinery for further progress, and by Indianising the services.Mr. Basu tells me that in his own discussions with his friends among leadingpoliticians he found &apos; complete unanimity of approval of the general and essential features of the scheme.&quot; He adds : &apos; I am assured that .... your scheme will havethe cordial support of by far the largest and most influential section of the indian people.&quot; I attach importance also to the fact that Sir Sankaran Nair, the Indianmember of Lord Cbelmsford&apos;s Council, is in general agreement with the proposals.9. The general attitude of the European non-official community is well known.They are not much interested in politics ; they are not enthusiastic about theannouncement of the 20th August. But the clearer-sighted members of the communityfully recognise that advance is necessary. Their opinion will be critical but by nomeans uncompromisingly adverse; indeed, I believe that possibly a majority in bombay and a considerable minority in Calcutta will adhere to the scheme. the agitation conducted by Lord Sydenham certainly does not represent the views of thecommunity as a whole.10. Finally, I hope that the official services, wffiich recognise as clearly asanyone that the situation imperatively demands new treatment, though they mayhave valuable criticisms to offer on points of detail, will lend their undoubtedlyeffective voice in support of such a programme as we put forward.    In any case,Appendix I.2 Appendix II.
I feel sure that they will loyally support whatever the decision of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment is.11. I come now to the action which I hope the Cabinet will, agree to take. Itwould, of course, be an immense gain if our proposals could go forth to&apos;encounterthe criticism for which we are explicitly pledged to afford an opportunity, underthe definite endorsement of the Cabinet. But the subject is very complex, and atthis time of great pre-occrrpation, it seems to me impossible that the Cabinet should give it the necessary study without involving great delay in publication. But delay isin itself an evil. I know that the Viceroy thinks so, and my colleagues have expressedthe same opinion in the letter which I attach. There is great danger that if we delay to take action we shall afford another opportunity to those who wish to misrepresentus in India of saying that faith is again being broken. Therefore, of the three courses which were suggested at the Cabinet&apos;s preliminary consideration of thismatter, I incline to think that the alternative of assenting to publication for criticismboth in England and in India without detailed consideration or endorsement by theCabinet is the best practical course.12. I am reluctant to add to the war anxieties of the Cabinet, but even thequestion of political changes in India cannot be dissociated from the war. India&apos;capacity for war effort is definitely limited, and I do not pretend that anything we can do to satisfy her political aspirations will call forth such access of co-operation as willbe in any way decisive. But it is certainly important to avoid a state of things inIndia which would not only impair her war effort, but might also place new positiveburdens upon the military resources of the Empire. At the Conference which, in response to the Prime MinisteFs recent message, the Viceroy called at Delhi, it was apparent, in spite of the absence of the more bitter critics of Government, that itwould be impossible to secure the cessation of political activity during the war, andthat many of those present were awaiting the application to India in a manner suitable to its conditions of the principles for which the British Empire stands. If, therefore,there is any prolonged delay in making it plain to India that His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave under their consideration a genuine measure of advance towards responsible government, 1 apprehend that the comparative quietude of expectancy which hascharacterised the country since August last will come to an end, and that we shall be faced with a recurrence of agitation, and possibly disorder, with which it will taxour immediate resources to cope, and, what is more serious, which will leave a feeling of great bitterness that will make the eventual settlement much more difficult.E. S. M.May 29, 1918.Appendix I.H.M.S. &quot;Dufferin,&quot;Dear Montagu, May 3, 1918.You have communicated to us, who formed part of your mission to India, thescheme of constitutional reforms proposed in the system of government in british india which has been worked out and agreed upon between His Excellency the viceroy and yourself.The scheme is the outcome of discussions, in which you have given us the privilege of taking a continuous part, and it embodies the conclusions arrived at inthose discussions. We need only say, therefore, that we unitedly support yourrecommendations and are prepared to recommend their adoption to public opinion,both in England and in India. In our view, while safeguarding Imperial interests and providing for the proper maintenance of law and order, they carry out His Majesty&apos;sGovernment^ announcement of the 20th August last by providing at once for such aninstalment of self-government as is at present practicable and safe, together withstatutory machinery for its development at subsequent stages.We would further submit an urgent plea for the publication of these proposals assoon as can be arranged. It is impossible now to avoid discussions on constitutional reforms in India, whatever may be the objection to having such discussions inwar-time ; but we are convinced that there would be serious inconveniences and evenrisks unless the further discussion of these subjects is guided by regard, on the onehand, to the substantial measure of reform that is now practicable, and, on the other,to the limits within which reforms at this stage must be necessarily confined. Wewould, therefore, wish to represent to you our strong view of the desirabibty of
Appendix II.Despatch from the Government of India.1. We have the honour to inform you that we have been furnished with copies ofthe Report on Indian Constitutional Reforms drawn up by His Excellency the viceroy and yourself for submission to His Majesty&apos;s Government.2. Though this most important document represents views for which the signatories thereto are alone responsible, we desire to record the fact that it wasframed after prolonged discussion with us. There are, no doubt, detailed recommenda-tions on which some of us hold divergent views, but we wish to convey our cordialsupport to general policy which the Report embodies.113-D.II. Note by Lord Curzon.I was instructed at the Cabinet of the 24-th May to write a note on Mr. Montagvdareport of his recent mission to India.This report has been circulated to the Cabinet, and gives an account in general terms of the proposals put forward by his colleagues and himself, and of the degree of support which he expects them to meet with in India.I think that the Secretary of State has under-estimated the fundamental nature ofthe change which he proposes to introduce into the Government of India, proceeding as it does far beyond anything that has been previously contemplated or discussed inthis country (even if it falls short of the expectations that may have been arousedamong the small but vociferous band of extremists inTuclia), as well as the degree of opposition which it will excite in many powerful quarters.His proposals, if adopted, will create as time proceeds (probably with little delay)a complete revolution in the governing relations between India and this country  a revolution all the more incalculable in effect, because some of these plans areadmittedly only a transitory expedient, bridging the gap between the old order andan unexplored future, and are certain to give rise to an early agitation for concessionsmuch more extreme. This revolution may be inevitable. It may conceivably be wise.I do not pause to discuss that to-day. But let none of my colleagues conceal from himself that the change will be as profound and vital as between an Ireland under theImperial Parliament at Westminster and an Ireland under a home Rule parliament at Dublin.Further, when the proposals are known, I doubt very much whether the &quot; officialclasses,&quot; as the Secretary of State calls them, by which I understand him to mean theIndian Civil Service in particular, will give them even the tacit measure of support which he anticipates. On the contrary, I think that they will excite a very widespreadcriticism and alarm.It would be premature, however, to discuss these aspects of the case, or todetermine to-day whether we shall do well to accept the scheme or not.The Secretary of State&apos;s immediate plea is for early publication and an appeal to public opinion in this country and in India.   There I think that he is right.publishing the proposals for consideration, both in England and in India, without any-undue delay.We have only, in conclusion, to express to you our sense of the readiness withwhich you have throughout taken into consideration any suggestions which we havefrom time to time placed before you ; and to assure you that if at any later stage wecould give any assistance towards the passage of these reforms into law, we would gladly do whatever is in our power.Yours sincerely,(Signed) Donoughmore.F. W. Duke.Bhupendranath Basu.Charles Roberts.The Right Hon. the Secretar\- of State for India.
The reasons against such a course are not of negligible value. It may be saidthat publication will render it difficult for the Government to modify, and impossiblefor the Government to reject, the main outlines of the scheme hereafter. Nationalistopinion in India may agitate for more, but will not, it may be urged, be content with less. It will be represented with more or less plausibility and no doubt with muchexaggeration that a deplorable effect would be produced in India by which, be itremembered, is always meant only a minute section of the entire Indian population ifcurtailment of the plan were afterwards insisted upon. This argument is indeedalways employed by the advocates of any considerable change in India we have heard it more than once during the past few weeks and India is not deficient in either the talent or the experience to see that the prophecy, if made, shall be as far aspossible fulfilled.Further, it may be said that the experiment of launching upon the public a schemefor the future government of India which, though it emanates from the Viceroy andthe Secretary of State, has not been seen by the local Governments in India, has notbeen approved (so far as I know) by the India Council at home, and has not even been examined by the Cabinet in London, is wholly without precedent in the histoiy ofour relations with India. I believe this to be the case. No previous change and none has approached this in magnitude  has been inaugurated without having to run the gauntlet for many months, perhaps years, of all these tribunals, or without the finalimprimatur of Government approval.There is much force in these arguments, but I do not regard them as conclusivefor these reasons.In the first place, the proposed appeal to public opinion before a final decision isarrived at is in a sense an admission that that opinion - and it cannot be the opinion ofa selected class or section only of the interested parties is entitled to be heard beforejudgment is passed, and may even exercise a potent influence upon the verdict. this in itself may render change not more but less difficult.Secondly, the publication of the Report should be accompanied by the clearestexplanation that it has taken place before and in the main because the Governmenthave not yet found time to consider, much less endorse, the scheme, and has been sanctioned only with a view to help the Government in undertaking the task later on.I should not advocate publication were such an explanation which can be givenin reply to a Parliamentary question or otherwise-not to he forthcoming, nor should Iadvocate it if I thought that publication were to be accompanied by a full expositionof the scheme from the Secretary of State, since such an exposition could not fail to invest the announcement with a measure of Government authority which it does not atpresent possess, and would render it exceedingly difficult either for the Government tointroduce, or for the Secretary of State to accept, modifications later on. When a secretary of State speaks from the Front Bench, he speaks for the Government with full responsibility, and his utterance implies their united support. 1 But in this case he isthe author of a report to the Government analogous to the many reports that are constantly presented to the War Cabinet by Ministers and Secretaries of State, and which do not become a Government policy or claim the privilege of being so announced inParliament until the Government has discussed and accepted them in Cabinet. Ifthis report is published, in advance it is only because considerations of expediency and convenience appear to render it desirable.In these circumstances the appeal to public opinion if made should not, I submit,be attended by anything which will, however remotely, appear to prejudge the ultimatedecision. Indeed, if such a statement were made in the House of Commons there areplenty. of persons in the blouse of Lords who would at once challenge it andinsist on exploring the real position. Equally if the Secretary of State does not makea pronouncement here, ought the Viceroy not to make a pronouncement, as I am told that he desires to do, in India. If he were at liberty to do so, any substantial modificationof the scheme at a later date could only be followed either by a further rebuff to himor by his resignation. When public opinion in India and here has had time to pronounceupon the scheme the Cabinet will be in a position to undertake its examination with greater advantage. Till then I will ask leave to postpone any remarks that I may-have to make, oidy asking my colleagues once more to bear in mind that whetherthe proposed plans be regarded as moderate or extreme, and very likely both opinionswill be heard, they will, if accepted, involve a complete and irrevocable change inthe political and administrative relations of Great Britain and India. For they proposeto do two things, neither of which has hitherto been contemplated, and both ofwhich have been quite recently and solemnly disavowed by British Liberal Ministers,
viz., (1) to lay the foundations of a parliamentary system in India, which was almostpassionately repudiated by Lord Morley in 1909; and (2) to set up almost completeIndian provincial autonomy, which Lord Crowe, his successor as Secretary of State,from his scat in Parliament not less emphatically and authoritatively disavowed.Both of these Ministers may have been quite mistaken. But their mistakes, if theywere so, should make us more, not less, cautious.C. of K.June -I, J91S.114-D.[II. - Note by Mr. Chamberlain.Lord Gurzon&apos;s note on Mr. Montagu&apos;s Report raises three important questions :First, whether the Report is now to be published ; secondly, what action is to lie takenby the Cabinet upon it ; and, thirdly, if it be published, what attitude are the Secretaryof State and the Viceroy to adopt towards it?Lord Curzon rightly lays stress upon the immense change in the governingrelations between India and this country which is proposed in the Report, and theCabinet will be under no misapprehension upon this point, ft is, in my opinion, noexaggeration to say. as Lord Curzon does, that it amounts to &quot;a revolution/&apos; But it isnot, in my opinion, Mi&apos;. Montagu&apos;s Report which make this revolution, ft is thedeclaration which the Secretary of State was authorised to make on behalf of HisMajesty&apos;s Government on the 20thAugust, 19.17. It was then stated that &quot;the policyof His Majesty&apos;s Government is .... the gradual development of self-governing institutions with a view to the progressive realisation of responsible Government inIndia as an. integral part of the British Empire.&quot;It. is this declaration which is the fundamental point of departure from anything which up to that time had been avowed by any British Government. From themoment that it became necessary to make a declaration it was, in my opinion, as theCabinet are aware, impossible for the British Government to avow as the goal of theirpolicy any other object than the one here stated. But once that object was avowed,the break with the past was made, and the revolution of which Lord Curzon speaksbecame inevitable.This declaration, necessitated by the rapid development of Indian politics underthe stimulus of the war and the declared war aims of Great Britain and her Allies,naturally aroused great expectations in India where the interest in political reform wasstimulated and sustained at a high pitch by the visit of the Secretary of State and hiscolleagues. Whatever be the possible disadvantages of publishing the Report, I think they are outweighed by the certain disadvantages of attempting to withhold it. It willbe remembered that the Secretaiy of State informed Parliament that ample opportunitywould be afforded for public discussion and consideration of any changes which he might recommend. To attempt now to withhold the Report would, I think, produceon the one hand an impression that the British Government, was insincere, and did not intend to follow up the declaration of August last, and on the other hand, would leadto a violent agitation in India which would set at naught ail the limits and restrictionsfixed in that declaration and would sweep into the ranks of tire extremists all thedisappointed reformers of moderate views.I agree, therefore, with Lord Curzon,.that the Report must be published. I agree,further, that under the circumstances it must be published for information and discussion, in advance of anj- detailed consideration by His Majesty&apos;s Government andwithout their final decision u )on it. I think, however, that it would be a misfortune ifit went out without any indication of our views. It seems to me that we should accompany the publication with a statement repeating the declaration of the20th August; that we should reaffirm the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government infavour of &quot;the gradual development of self-governing institutions with a view to the progressive realisation of responsible government in India as an integral part of theBritish Empire,&quot; and their determination that &quot;substantial steps in this directionshould be taken as soon as possible,&quot; but that we should also reaffirm explicitly,because it has been challenged, the statement that &quot; the British Government and theGovernment of India must be the judges of the time and measure of each advance.&quot;I think it would be a great advantage if we could also say that, whilst reservingfor further consideration the methods of applying these principles, we accept certainbroad principles laid clown in the Report, such for instance as that the Government ofIndia must be capable of imposing its will in essential matters, and must therefore remain for the present responsible to Parliament only ; that in no case can complete
responsibility, even for provincial government, be transferred at present to an elected assembly or to an assembly in which elected members are in a majority, but that we accept the idea of a division of subjects and the immediate transfer of responsibility inregard to some of them to such bodies.    Again I should like to affirm the necessity for allowing great latitude in the application of the reforms to the different provinces, andthe expediency of a large measure of devolution of authority from the Government ofIndia to provincial Governments, with the consequential relaxation of control by thehome Government and Parliament.   The circumstances of the Indian provinces are sodiverse, that on no other conditions is progress safe or indeed possible.   It is true, as pointed out by Lord Curzon, that this runs counter to Lord Crewe&apos;s declaration in theHouse of Lords (though not to his Delhi despatch), but in my opinion no moreshortsighted declaration of policy in relation to India was ever made unless it beLord Morley&apos;s expressed belief that the reforms associated with his name offered apermanent resting place for the Government of India.   It may be that the Secretaryof State would be prepared to suggest other broad principles which might be similarlystated.   In particular, I think it likely that he will consider that some mentionmust be made of the relation of the Native States to  British $India.   But theseare matters which can be discussed in greater detail if the principle of such adeclaration is approved.   The reasons for which I think some declaration is importantare, first to reassure moderate Indian opinion and to make clear to all classes ofopinion that there will be no going back from the declaration of the 20th August,and secondly to fix with at least equal clearness the limits beyond which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will not permit the present measure of reform to go.   To leave any doubtupon the first point would imperil our chances of success by encouraging any portionof the Indian Civil Service or Anglo-Indian community which is opposed, to the policythen announced to believe that it is still possible for them to defeat that policy inprinciple instead of concentrating their attention on the safeguards which are necessaryin its execution.   To leave any doubt upon the second point would be to forgo theuse of the immense influence which an authoritative declaration by Government stillhas upon the Indian people and to make easy the attempt of extremists to rush indian opinion over the limits which His Majesty&apos;s Government deliberately fixed when they decided to enter upon the new path.Lastly, I come to the consideration of the attitude which the Secretary of State andViceroy must adopt to the Report when published. It is clear that under thecircumstances the position of the Secretary of State, though he is a member of theGovernment, cannot be exactly that of the Cabinet or of the Government as a whole.It has to be remembered that the Report is the Report of the Secretary of State andthe Viceroy and that it bears their signatures. They cannot disclaim a responsibilityfor its recommendations which the Cabinet have not yet assumed ; they cannot treat the propositions announced in it as open questions to the same extent that the Cabinetcan do. But I agree with Lord Curzon that it is very desirable that they shouldcommit themselves as little as possible to the particular methods which they havesketched, and not at all to details -in other words, I think they should confinethemsefves as much as possible to a broad exposition of the principles underlying the scheme, and to such explanations as may be necessary to make their proposalsintelligible and to prevent or remove misapprehensions. But I think it wouldbe quite impossible to exact from them an undertaking that they should launchtheir bark upon the ocean without a word of explanation and without the right to give some broad explanation and argumentative defence of the conclusions at which theyprovisionally arrived. &quot; They have very wisely abstained from attempting to solve indetail many of the problems with which they were confronted. They have, in myopinion rather unfortunately, entered into details on some points which were not essential for the purpose in hand. I hope that in anything they say they will make itclear that they still have an open mind as to the best methods of carrying out many ofthe objects which they wish to secure, and that they are ready to welcome and profitby both the public and private discussion to which their Report will give rise. But Ithink that the Cabinet must be content to trust to their discretion in the use of the liberty which, cannot be denied to them. The position of any Viceroy or Secretaay ofState who had signed such a Report and was yet precluded from giving any explanation of it or replying to any criticisms would, I think, be one that none of us would beprepared to accept for himself, and cannot impose upon a colleague..
