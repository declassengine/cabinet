The Western Front.]. THE Director of Military Intelligence reported that therehad been a good deal of lighting yesterday to the west of Chateau-Thierry, but the situation was much more stable. The german advance yesterday was insignificant, and the French had recapturedseveral villages. On the whole, the result of the fighting on Sundayand Monday had been satisfactory, because, according to GeneralAnthoine (Chief of Staff to General Petain), Sunday and Mondaywere critical days, as on those days no Allied reinforcements wouldbe arriving, and, in the result, the general position had been main-tained. The number of German divisions which had been indentified in the Aisne battle was 41, although perhaps as many as 47 had beenemployed. Up to the present, Prince EupprechPs reserves were pratically untouched, only one division having, it was thought, been drawn from his reserve, though not yet engaged on the Aisne-Marnefront, leaving him with 19 fresh divisions in reserve from thesea to the Somme. During the next eleven days, German divisions would be recovering at the rate of about one a clay.General Macdonogh stated that no more German divisions were coming over from the Eastern front at the moment, although perhaps10 might be brought over out of the 33 now remaining in Russia.Operations of theIXth Corps.2. With reference to War Cabinet 418, Minute 1, the Director ofMilitary Intelligence said that he had had a conversation on Sundaylast with General Hamilton-Gordon, the commander of the IXth Corps,from whom he had learned some particulars of the opening phasesof (the recent German attack. General Hamilton-Gordon had three divisions of the IXth. Corps in the front line on the 27th May:&apos; the50th division on the left, the 8th in the centre, and the 21st on theright, in the Berry-au-Bac area. The first news of an impendingattack came on the night of the 25th-2bth May from a deserter.The battle started with heavy gas shelling, especially of the backareas, followed by an intense bombardment for 2A hours. Thewire having been cut by trench mortars, the enemy attacked in theusual way, with, the assistance of tanks. The 50th division was left &quot;in the air&quot; by the retirement of the 22nd Frenchdivision on the left, without warning to the 50th division. TheGermans were already in the town where the commanding officer ofthe 50th division was quartered when he received the first intima-tion that the French had fallen back. The Germans came throughthe gap left by the 22nd French division, and got behind the50th division, which suffered severely. &apos; The German tanks were used mainly at the point of junction of the 50th and 8th divisions,and succeeded in working along a valley and getting behind the8th division. The 21st division made a very good fight, but, owingto what had happened to the 8th division, it had to withdraweventually behind the Aisne. The 25th division, which was in reserve, was put, by order of the French Army Commander, intothe second position, and was over run by troops coming back. Allfour divisions suffered heavily. The faulty French lateral com-munications, and especially the failure of the 22nd French division to warn the 50th British division, were important factors in causing the retreat.Employment of enemy Tanks.3. The Director of Military Intelligence stated that the enemy had made great use of tanks on the first day of the battle, but theydid not follow up on the second day, so that probably they were of a heavy type. A new pattern of heavy tank was being employedby the enemy, having a gun mounted in a turret in the centre ofthe tank, whereas the first pattern had a gun in the bows. TheGermans were using tanks on Saturday last, east of Rheims, and theFrench were said to have captured four of them.
Enemy Casualties.4. The Director of Military Intelligence, in reply to a question,said that he did not think the German casualties in the recent fighting had been severe, except in the neighbourhood of Soissonsand opposite the 21st division. In the advance from the Ailetteto frames they had probably been very light. On the other hand,since Saturday last, they had probably increased considerably.Gas Attack byBritish.5. With reference to War Cabinet 411, Minute 5, the Directorof Military Intelligence stated, in a reply to a question, that, so faras he knew, there was no evidence of the success or failure of our recent use of projector gas, but he would have enquiries made andreport later to the War Cabinet.The Italian Front.6. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that threeAustro-FIungarian cavalry divisions had appeared behind the Piavefront on the Portogruaro area. Some additional aerodromes had also been observed, and the evidence pointed to a probable attackon that front. The Italians had 8 divisions there, confronting13 Austrian divisions and 5 Austrian cavalry divisions. Conditionsin Austria were undoubtedly bad, but he would not like to say thatthey were so bad as to prevent an attack. General Delrne-Radcliffehad sent a telegram to Lord Nortkcliffe stating that no report ofthe recent Pome Conference had yet reached the Jugo-Slavs un austria, and its effect, therefore, would not be felt on the nextoffensive. Lie. understood that General Diaz was taking steps toimprove this faulty propaganda by dropping leaflets from long-distance aeroplanes.Macedonia.7. The Director of Military Intelligence stated that the attackmade by the Greeks on the 30th May appeared to have been very successful. The Greek troops, supported by French artillery, had attacked on the west of Doiran, on a front of some 7-j miles and adepth of 14 miles, and had captured their objective at one rush,taking 1,500 Bulgarian prisoners (including 33 officers) and a large quantity of material. The result was greatly to improve the positionof the Allied forces in that sector of the front.The War Cabinet requested The Secretary of State for War to draft a message congratulatingM. Venezelos on the success of the Greek troops.Russia:The Caucasus.8. The Director of Military Intelligence stated that two Germanbattalions were being sent across the Black Sea, probably to Batum,for use in the Caucasus in co-operation with the Turks. The turks had occupied Sukhum Kale. It was reported that the Germans were taking arms with them with a view to arming prisoners. News hadbeen received that the Germans were contemplating making Tiflis abase for a flank guard along the Central Asian area.Return of German 9. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that a numberPrisoners in Russia.   Gf German prisoners were returning to Germany from Russia andwould be a further source of man-power to the enemy.-Palestine.10. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that anotherTurkish division from the Caucasus had appeared in Palestine,making 13 in all.
11. The Director of Military Intelligence informed the WarCabinet that a certain number of Turks were being withdrawn fromthe Kirkuk area for operations against the Jelus.12. The First Sea Lord reported that the usual bombing ofBruges and Zeebrugge had taken place.13. The First Sea Lord reported that one of our armed trawlers,,while following astern of a convoy off the North Coast of Ireland,had been attacked by an enemy submarine and sunk by gunfire.- Fourteen men were killed, and the skipper and two men were taken on board the submarine, two of these being wounded, including theskipper. Four survivors, three of whom were wounded, had beenpicked up by a destroyer. All confidential books had been destroyed.14. The First Sea Lord stated that a telegram had just beenreceived from the Naval Attache at Rome reporting that an Austrianaeroplane had flown from Pola and. had surrendered apparentlywithout fighting.15. Mr. Chamberlain called the attention of the War Cabinetto a telegram to Bio de Janeiro (No. 262), according to whichthe 1 rench were offering coal to Brazil from Cardiff. This was an extraordinary offer, in view of the fact that we were unable tosupply coal to Brazil because of our efforts to supply coal to Franceand Italy.The War Cabinet referred the matter to Lord Robert CeciLsCommittee (see War Cabinet 424, Minute 5).10. The War Cabinet had before them a note by the ForeignOffice on a decision of the Netherlands Government to despatch a convoy to the Dutch East Indies (Paper G.T.-4710).Lord Robert Cecil stated that the Dutch proposed to send the convoy through our blockade and to bring it back again. The probableobject of the Dutch, acting \under enemy pressure, was to break our blockade. Lord Robert Cecil added that the situation had changed since the memorandum by the Foreign Office was written, and thathe proposed circulating, in the near future, another memorandum setting out the particulars up to date.The War Cabinet decided To refer the matter to the Northern Neutral Countries Com-mittee for consideration and report.17. Lord Curzon drew the attention of the War Cabinet to thepublication in the juess of the evidence taken in the PembertonBilling libel action, and stated that, in his opinion, such publicationwas doing more harm than anything that had appeared in thisconnection for many years Opportunity was being taken to attackevery section of society, and the social effect must inevitably be bad.Insinuations and accusations were being made against public menwithout a shred of foundation. Lord Curzon asked if nothing could be done, by means of censorship or otherwise, to prevent suchpublications being made by the press in the future.&apos; Sir George Cave pointed out that the publication of evidence which was scandalous but not obscene must be left to the honour of the press, and that even if such matter was submitted to the
Censor, the press could onlyfbe asked not to publish it, there being no penalty if the orders of the Censor were disobeyed, unless thematter contained information prejudicial to the conduct of the war.Sir George Cave added that he was informed that the Judge, in thepresent case, had asked the press not to publish some of theevidence. The Judge could riot direct such cases to he held incamerd ; and, even if this could have been done, the suspicion andtalk which would have arisen outside the Court, relative to what had been suppressed, would have been endless.Exchange ofPrisoners of War:Appointment of delegation.18. The First Sea Lord drew the attention of the War Cabinetto their decision in War Cabinet 419, Minute 10 (e), in which it was stated that the views of the Admiralty were to be considered as towhat delegates should represent the British Government in thediscussion relating to the exchange, &amp;c, of prisoners of war, and pointed out that, by War Cabinet 423, Minute 8, no Admiralty repre-sentative had apparently been appointed as one of the delegates.He drew the attention of the War Cabinet to Paper G.T.-4737,recommending that Captain Ivitson should be appointed as theAdmiralty delegate, and pointed out the great difference, in hisopinion, between the status of a delegate and of one who is onlycalled as an expert to express the Admiralty views.It was mentioned that, in deciding as to the delegates, it hadbeen overlooked that the views of the Admiralty had not yet beenreceived in regard to this matter.Sir George Cave pointed out that he considered it highly desirable, now that the composition of the delegation had been communicated to the Germans, that no additions should be madethereto. He added that he was quite willing to undertake that, inputting forward any agreement bearing on naval matters, he would consult the Admiralty expert accompanying the delegation, and wouldgive him every opportunity to refer to the Admiralty any points of conflict which might arise.It was also pointed out that, if a Xaval delegate was nowappointed, we should be emphasising to the Germans the extreme importance we attach to our retention of enemy submarine officersami men, and that, moreover, the Admiralty would have anopportunity of expressing to the War Cabinet direct any objectionsthat they might have to the agreement, inasmuch as no such agreement would be concluded without the War Cabinet first con-sidering the same.The War Cabinet decided that An Admiralty delegate should not be appointed, but thatAdmiralty representatives should accompany the delega-tion.Instructions toDelegation.19. Sir George Cave informed the War Cabinet that he had drawn up some general instructions, in wide terms, for the con-sideration of the War Cabinet, and the guidance of the delegation.He suggested that the Terms of Reference should be somewhat asfollows : (a.) The transfer to neutral countries of British officers captured in 1914, 1915, and 1916, in exchange for a similarnumber of German officers captured in those years.(6.) The repatriation of other British combatant prisoners captured in those years, in exchange for a similarnumber of German combatant prisoners of corresponding-rank.(c.) The repatriation or internment of British civilian prisonersupon such terns as may be arranged.[1365-425] C
(d.) The adjustment of any other question which may be raised in connection with , the exchange and treatment ofprisoners.With regard to limiting the time to the years 1914 to 1916, sir george Cave pointed out that the object of this was to avoid having a running agreement, similar to that of the French, without further negotiations on the subject taking place, but it was pointed outthat it would be difficult to defend any agreement that gave less favourable terms to our men than those that had been obtained bythe French. It was decided that the delegates should have a freehand on this point.It was pointed out that the Terms of Reference, as proposed bySir George Cave, did not lay sufficient stress with regard to animprovement in the treatment accorded to our prisoners in Germany,and that it was important that some modification should take placein this connection, in view of the strong feeling that prevailed inthe United Kingdom.Lord Newton asked that the delegates might be authorised to threaten retaliation of some kind if the treatment of our prisonersdid not improve, and it was admitted that, as we had acceptedretaliation in principle, it would be only right to give the delegationthe power to use the threat.As regards the civilian prisoners, of which we had a verylarge preponderance in this country, Sir George Cave pointed outthat the Germans would probably press for an &quot; all-for-all &quot;exchange, as had been done in the case of the French, whereneither side had any marked preponderance, but he was opposed tosuch a concession.It was pointed out, however, that these civilian prisoners mightbe used as a means of obtaining compensation with &quot;regard tocombatant prisoners and also as regards merchant officers and men,whom we do not treat as combatants.With regard to the civilians interned in the dominions, theview was held that no means of transport would be forthcoming,and Mr. Long mentioned that no proposal of the Germans to useships flying the German flag for this purpose would be tolerated bythe dominions. It was mentioned, however, that the Germans mightpropose the use of neutral ships flying neutral flags in thisconnection.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The British delegates should be authorised to negotiate forthe repatriation or internment in neutral countries ofBritish combatant prisoners who had been for upwards of eighteen months in captivity in exchange for a similarnumber of German prisoners and for the repatriation orinternment of British civilian prisoners in Germanyupon such terms as can be arranged.(b ) An agreement should not be made for the exchange ofGerman submarine prisoners or for the transport ofGerman prisoners from overseas without consultationwith the Admiralty representative, and that, if necessary,the questions should be referred home for further instructions.(c.) Civilian prisoners should not be exchanged without regardto numbers except upon the terms of some equivalentcompensation being given.(d.) The delegates should put forward in the strongest possible way the breaches by the Germans of their agreements asto the treatment of British prisoners and the grave ill-treatment of some of such prisoners, and should endeavour to obtain guarantees against the recurrencethese practices ; and the delegates should be^thorised, if necessary, to threaten reprisals :
Enemy DebtsCommittee.thefollowing20. The War Cabinet had under considerationpapers relative to Enemy Debts : Report of the Enemy Debts Committee (Paper P.-23) ;Memorandum   on  Return   of  Debts  and  Properties (PaperP.-23A);Extract from a letter from the Chairman of the Enemy DebtsCommittee to the Treasury (Paper 25/T/87).In the latter it was stated that if the Recommendations of theCommittee appear to His Majesty&apos;s Government acceptable inprinciple, it will, no doubt, be thought necessary to consult theGovernments of the Dominions of India and of the other parts of theEmpire, and that the matter would appear to be suitable fordiscussion with the Dominion representatives when they are in thiscountry for the Meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet. The extractfurther pointed out that simultaneous consultation would be facilitated if the Report were published.The War Cabinet decided that The matter should be brought before the Imperial war conference, and that at present the Report of the EnemyDebts Committee should not be published.Meeting ofMunitions TradeUnion AdvisoryCommittee :Statement byMr. Barnes.21. Mr. Barnes informed  the War   Cabinet that he was onWediie6day addressing a meeting of the Munitions Trade UnionAdvisory Committee and representatives of the Munitions Industry,and that the Director of Military Operations had drawn up amemorandum containing statements as to the position and numbersof the Allied forces on the Western front, which he was willing that Mr. Barnes should put before the meeting if the War cabinet approved. Mr. Barnes pointed out that this statement containedinformation giving the relative numbers of the opposing forces,which he considered it was undesirable to give.The War Cabinet agreed wdth Mr. Barnes, and suggested thatin his speech to the meeting he should give a general statement as to the serious position on the Western front,without giving any figures.(Initialled)      A. B. L.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 4, 1918.o(e.) The delegates should have full power to settle any minormatter connected with the treatment or exchange ofprisoners which they might consider it desirable toraise, or which might be raised by the german delegates;(/.) The agreement should be subject to ratification by HisMajesty&apos;s Government.
