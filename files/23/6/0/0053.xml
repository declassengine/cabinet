The Italian Front. 1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff explained, withthe aid of a map, the Austrian attack on the Italian front. On thewhole, the result, so far, was favourable to the Allies, inasmuch as very little progress had been gained by the enemy in proportion tothe size of his effort. The Austrians appeared to have succeeded inmaking two lodgments on our side of the Lower Piave ; they hadbeen driven back a little, and were now reported to be clinging onto the river bank. It might therefore be hoped that they mightsoon be pushed back into the river. On the Asiago Plateau, wherethe British troops were engaged, after giving way slightly, we hadre-established ourselves, and the French troops appeared to havedone the same. Twenty Austrian divisions had been identified inthe battle, of which two had come down from the centre of Austria,but it was probable that more than this number had been engaged,although not actually identified. On the total front, from Switzer-land to the coast, the enemy had fifty-five divisions, and the allies had fifty-four. During the offensive the Austrians claimed to have captured 10,000 prisoners, while the Italians claimed about 3,000.The Western 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that there-^ront- was no news from the Western front beyond the ordinary raids and bombing. It was probable that the enemy were getting ready fortheir next attack, which might be expected to take place any day.General Wilson indicated the direction in which General Fochthought the next German attempt would be made. Asked as towhether he thought it likely that the enemy would attack in twoplaces simultaneously, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff saidthat he thought that this was unlikely, inasmuch as the army of theCrown Prince could not now contain many fresh divisions, while itwould not pay to divide Prince Rupprecht&apos;s army into two halves.With regard to the fact that the Germans had ceased to press atCompiegne and Villers-Cotterets, the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff said it must be remembered, in the first place, that the countryin that neighbourhood was extremely difficult, and also there wasthe normal difficulty in any advance for the advancing side to get their guns up. The retiring side, on the other hand, were able to fall back along their roads and railways.Stores at Dunkirk. 3. With reference to War Cabinet 427, Minute 3, the First sea lord said that, as the result of enquiries which he had made inregard to the recent removal of naval and military stores from dunkirk, he had been informed that the only stores which had been removed were some bridge work, light locomotives, and a smallquantity of other stores ; the bulk of the stores was still there.It was generally agreed that Dunkirk should continue to beused for current work, but that it would not be wise to pile upsupplies there.Admiralissimo in 4. With reference to War Cabinet 420, Minutes 5 &apos;i) and 6 (ii),the Mediterranean, the War Cabinet had under consideration an Admiralty memo-randum (Paper G.T.-4788), dated the 8th June, 1918, relative tothe co-ordination of the naval efforts of the Allies in the Mediter-ranean.The First Lord of the Admiralty stated that since this paper was written there had been a meeting of the Allied Naval Council,and that the general attitude of the Italian representatives had notbeen satisfactory with regard to their making an increased effort inthe Mediterranean. The submarine warfare in those waters was now being waged by British and French forces, the Italians keepingtheir anti-submarine craft for the protection of the Italian coast and ports, and not even taking steps to convoy the supplies which we
Man-Power:Release of MenBorn in the Years1895-1899.&apos; o. The War Cabinet had before them a recommendation of theWar Priorities Committee (Paper G.T.-4854) that, having consideredthe resolution of the Permanent (Labour) Sub-Committee, it wasnecessary to make the clean out of Grade I men, born in the years1898 and 1899, immediately effective.General Smuts stated that the War Priorities Committee were of opinion that this clean-cut should become operative at once, andthat no man born in these years should be retained after the 30thJune in any occupation in Admiralty or Ministry of Munitions firmsother than an occupation for which the age limit of 19 is fixed inthe Schedule of Protected Occupations. General Smuts added that,with regard to the further recommendation of the Labour Sub-Com-mittee as to men born in the years 1897, 1896, 1895, the war priorities Committee had approved the principle of making theclean-cut effective in the case of Grade I men born in those years,but they had remitted the question to the Labour Sub-Committee towere sending to them. In view of the numher of vessels of theRussian Black Sea fleet now in German hands, and of the fact thatthe latter had taken over a number of efficient Russian destroyers,steps were being taken to transfer a numher of French destroyers,now in the Adriatic, to the iEgean, and the Italians had beeninformed that a numher of British destroyers would be similarlydiverted. There were also four British light cruisers attached tothe Italians for the protection of the Adriatic and the Otrantobarrage, but these had been allocated to Italy, under a convention,for the duration of the war, and, consequently, there would be some difficulty in withdrawing these vessels. What we desiredwas, that the Italians should throw their forces into an Allied pool,so that more general use might be made of the light forces in theMediterranean, with a view to defeating the enemy&apos;s submarineactivities in those waters. The First Lord stated that Admiralde Bon and Admiral Sims generally endorsed the British view, andhe understood that they were prepared to send to their government memorandum supporting the same and advocating its transmissionto the Italian authorities. A strong note on these lines had beenprepared by him, with a view to its transmission to the ItalianGovernment, which he recommended should be followed up by ajoint memorandum from Admiral Wemyss, Admiral de Bon, and admiral Sims, stating in specific terms what action it was proposed should be taken to improve conditions in the Mediterranean if theItalians fully co-operated in that sea.As regards the position of Admiral de Revel as Oommander-in-Chief of the Italian naval forces, it was urged that, as he had british ships under his orders, and consequently our vessels might be exposed to danger if not adequately supported, the British Govern-ment would be justified in urging upon the Italian Government thewithdrawal of Admiral de Revel from his command, just as they had done in the case of General Cadorna, although it was admitted that,in the latter case, the withdrawal only took place after a disaster tothe Italian army.The War Cabinet decided that The Foreign Office, after consultation with the Admiralty,should communicate with the French and american governments with a view to a separate memorandumbeing simultaneously presented to the Italian Government,urging upon that Government the need for efficientco-operation in the Mediterranean, with combined training,under one command, and, further, that steps should betaken by the Admiralty with a view to the preparation of a concerted representation to the Italian Government by admiral de Bon, Admiral Sims, and Admiral Wemyss,setting out in specific terms the alterations proposed toimprove the Allied naval situation in the Mediterranean.
report as early as possible as to the necessity and practicability of excluding any particular occupations and as to the possibility ofproviding a measure of elasticity. The only question, therefore,before the War Cabinet at the moment was the clean-cut of men ofthe ages of 19 and 20.The Minister of National Service stated that a serious state ofaffairs had arisen. The Tribunals all over the country were nowrefusing to pass the older men into the forces so long as fit menremained in protected Government industries. He had received,many resolutions from Tribunals on this subject. Sir auckland geddes pressed that a line of policy should be announced by theGovernment. There was no doubt that the clean-cut asked forwould have a serious effect on production, but he was of opinionthat this would only be temporary, and that within a month or soproduction would recover. It was vital to take some such step asthat now proposed in order to avoid a complete failure of theGovernments man-power policy. The number of recruits now being received was most unsatisfactory, and this month he expected to be20,000, 30,000, or perhaps 50,000 below the estimate.Mr. Churchill said that the Ministry of Munitions had acceptedthe principle of the clean-cut last October and that his department was proceeding on these lines. He felt strongly, however, that, ifthis clean-cut was accepted by the Government, it should also beapplied to Admiralty firms.The First Lord of the Admiralty stated that the War cabinet had decided on the 30th March, 1918 (War Cabinet 378, Minute 9),that 12,500 men should be released from Admiralty firms, and thiswould be completed before the agreed date, namely, the end of June,although the full number were not yet posted. If the furtherclean-cut of the men of the ages 19 and 20 was applied to admirality firms, he was afraid the consequences would be mostserious. There were certain trades (for instance, the anchor andchain trade) that were at the present moment hard pressed. GreatBritain supplied the whole of the Allied requirements in thesetrades, and if more men were taken away the consequences mightbe very serious.Sir Fl. Borne said that a clean-cut would also affect theAdmiralty tube works. The supply of labour for this particulartrade was already difficult to obtain, and the number of tubessupplied had been diminishing at the rate of 40,000 tubes amonth. It was only the existence of a reserve of tubes that had enabled the Admiralty to carry on an adequate supply. Anyrecruiting of coppersmiths also would have serious effects on thefitting out of ships, as there was already a shortage of coppersmiths.A similar condition existed with regard to instrument makers.The Prime Minister said that he would have had more sympathy with the difficulties of the Admiralty as regards this question ifthey had made greater efforts during the last two or three years tomeet the demands made upon them. In this particular case an impossible situation would be created if any difference were madein the treatment of Admiralty and other firms. The Prime Ministerquite realised the risks that were being run in deciding on thisclean-cut, but there were other risks to be considered, and it wasthe duty of the Government to make its choice between them. If,in a few months&apos; time, the Admiralty found that their programme was being seriously hampered, they must put the case before theWar Cabinet.The War Cabinet approved the recommendation of the war priorities Committee, that no man in Grade I, born in theyears 1898 or 1899, should be retained after the 30th Junein any occupation in Admiralty or Ministry of Munitionsfirms other than an occupation for which an age limit of19 is fixed in the Schedule of Protected Occupations.
Recruitment from coal Mines.TreasuryCommittee on contracts.7. With reference to War Cabinet 319, Minute 5, the WarCabinet had before them the Report of the Treasury Committee on contracts, and a memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on the subject (Paper G.T.-4826).The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that since theCommittee had reported he had been in consultation with theDepartments affected, and that they now agreed that its recom-mendations should be carried into effect. The Minister of Munitionssupported the recommendation of the Committee that there shouldbe one Ministry of Supply ; failing this, he had no objection to theother proposal of the Standing Committee. The Chancellor of theExchequer said that, subject to the approval of the War Cabinet, hehad asked Lord Colwyn to preside over the Standing Committees todeal with contracts and stores respectively recommended inparagraph 4 of the report, and that he was proposing to addSir Hugh Levick to the Committees to act as a representative of theTreasury. He asked for the authority of the War Cabinet to giveeffect to the recommendations of the Committee.The War Cabinet approved the action that the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer proposed to take.Proposal to invitea Resolution of thanks to british labour by theImperial WarCabinet.8. Mr. Barnes suggested that the Imperial War Cabinet mightbe moved to adopt a resolution thanking British labour for its great and strenuous efforts in the prosecution of the war.Whilst agreeing with Mr. Barnes as to the value of the services rendered by British labour, it was pointed out that it might beinvidious for the Imperial War Cabinet to address exclusive thanks to one section of the population or one part of the Empire. TheMinister of Munitions also pointed out that quite recently the king had addressed a special message of thanks to the Munition workers for their exertions made since the attack on the 21st March.The War Cabinet decided that The decision on this subject should be deferred for the present.Army ^ ^ 9. With reference to War Cabinet 274, Minute 14, the WarDemobilisation.        Cabinet had under consideration a memorandum by the Minister of reconstruction with  reference  to  Army  Demobilisation  (paper g.T.-4771).The Minister of Reconstruction pointed out that the only question at issue was the scale for unemployment benefit which wasto be paid to discharged soldiers who happened during the transition period to fall out of work. The general principles had already beenapproved by the War Cabinet, but had been referred back forfurther consideration on this question. Dr. Addison said that theWar Office, the Treasury, and the Ministry of Labour were all inagreement as to the principles of the scheme, but that the treasury had not yet been able to deal fully with the financial obligationsinvolved. Dr. Addison also pointed out that there was a very strong feeling that the members of the Women&apos;s Army Auxiliary Corpsshould be included in the proposals for Army Demobilisation.6. The War Cabinet took note of the Report of a Conferenceheld at 10, Downing Street, on the 13th June, 1918, on the outputof coal (Paper G.T.-1838).After a short discussion The Secretary was instructed to ascertain what steps the coal controller had taken to bring pressure to hear on both thecoal-owners and the miners in order to bring about anincrease in output.
The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The scale of payment as laid down in the memorandumquoted above should be approved, subject to theapproval of the Treasury in regard to the finance of thescheme, and that, if the Treasury could not agree tothe proposals, the question should be brought before theWar Cabinet for further consideration.(b.) The Minister of Reconstruction should forward a supple-mentary report dealing with the question of the inclusionof the Women&apos;s Army Auxiliary Corps and other women employed in France or other theatres of war in thescheme for Army Demobilisation.Government 10. With reference to War Cabinet 429, Minute 16, the WarOrganisation. Cabinet had under consideration a letter from the Chancellor of theExchequer expressing the opinion that the Financial Secretary tothe Treasury should be a member of the Standing Committee ofHome Affairs.Mr. Bonar Law stated that it would be impossible for him personally to attend meetings of the Committee, but that it wouldbe most desirable that the Treasury should be represented.It was pointed out that all the members of this Committee heldCabinet rank.The War Cabinet decided that This question should be deferred for discussion at a later date.Trade relations ofthe United King-dom within theEmpire.11. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum byMr. Walter Long (Paper 6.T.-4815), in which he stated that, inaccordance with War Cabinet decision 387, Minute 9, copies of theFirst and Second Reports on War Materials, prepared by the Com-mittee on the Trade Relations of the United Kingdom within theEmpire, had been sent out to the Dominions, and it was proposedthat these Reports should be discussed at the Imperial War Con-ference.Mr. Hew ins, who represented Mr. Long, said that, in order tofacilitate this discussion, a series of draft resolutions, embodying themain proposals of the Reports, had been drawn up, and it was pro-posed, if the War Cabinet approved, that these resolutions should bediscussed at the Imperial War Conference.In view of the possibility that, after discussion at the imperial war Conference, this question, at least in some of its bearings,might be discussed at the Imperial War Cabinet, the War cabinet decided that It would not be expedient at this stage to commit themselves toany definite opinion with regard to them. They thereforetook note of the above resolutions, and sanctioned the pro-posal that they should be forwarded to the Imperial war conference for discussion.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 17, 1918.
