Cabinet Meetings.1. The Prime Minister explained to the War Cabinet that acertain number of questions arose almost daily, in connection withthe military situation, enquiry into which, when made beforethe Cabinet as a whole, took up a large proportion of their time.This might be obviated if he carried out such enquiries as mightbe necessary at the War Office and reported the facts, when necessary, at a later hour to the Cabinet as a body. He therefore suggested that the regular meetings of the Cabinet should, infuture, commence at 12 noon.It was further proposed that one day a week, such day being-selected by the Secretary so as to ensure as far as possible the attendance of the Heads of Departments concerned, should be set aside for the disposal of Departmental matters not immediatelyaffecting the conduct of the war. On such occasions the cabinet would meet without the Prime Minister being present when theyassembled.The War Cabinet approved these two suggestions.Shipyard Labour:Supply and regulation.2. In connection with expediting the work of the War Cabinet,the question of the supply and regulation of labour to shipyards, as-referred to in Papers G.T.-4341, 4373, -1406, and 4469, was broughtto the notice of the War Cabinet. It was pointed out that theAdmiralty and the Ministry of Munitions were represented on theWar Priorities Committee, and that the supply and regulation oflabour for shipyards was a matter which primarily concerned those two Departments.The &quot;War Cabinet requested General Smuts to arrange for the War Priorities Committee tomeet at an early date, in order to consider the matter inits several bearings, the Minister of Labour being asked tobe present.And authorised General Smuts to make a decision on behalf of the War Cabinetin the matter.Attendance at 3. The  attention  of   the War Cabinet was drawn  to   theWar Cabinet desirability of confining the attendance at War Cabinet meetings toMeetings. the Ministers concerned in the subject under discussion.   It waspointed out, however, that, while this was highly desirable with aview to expediting the work, cases might arise when highly technical matters were involved, and it would then be necessary for ministers to bring with them the expert advisers belonging to their departments. It was generally agreed that the present tendencywas for too many experts to attend the meetings of the WarCabinet.The Western 4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that airFront, reconnaissances had shown that there had been a certain increase inthe number of dumps about and north of the Somme.Gas Attack byBritish.5. With reference to War Cabinet 410, Minute 6, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff stated that we had released, on theprevious night, 5,000 cylinders of gas, and used gas from 1,500projectors, between Lens and La Bassee. He added that therewere no means of ascertaining the effect of such offensives on our part, but that it was hoped, judging from our own experience insuch matters, that the casualties sinfered by the enemy in such attacks were very considerable.
Salonica.7. With reference to War Cabinet 405, Minute 8 (c), the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff informed the War Cabinet thatLieutenant-General Sir C. L. Woollcombe was leaving for Salonicaon the following day in order to confer with General Guillaumat.German AttackAnticipated.8. The Prime Minister stated that he had received information that Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig anticipated that the next attack would be made Yjy the Germans with a force of approximatelyeighty divisions.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff mentioned that he hadreceived a telegram from the French General Headcpiarters on thissubject, from which it appeared that, although our General Head-cpiarters anticipated an attack by from seventy to eighty divisions,General Foch did not agree. General Wilson&apos;s own view was thathe did not think the Germans could to-day muster eighty gooddivisions for an attack, although their refitted divisions were now coming along rapidly.Casualties onthe western front.9. With reference to War Cabinet 405, Minute 12, the Secretaryof State for War informed the War Cabinet that our losses betweenthe 21st March and the 9th May were 310,000, of whom 130,000were missing. Of the latter number, 90,000, at the utmost,might be considered prisoners. The French losses during thesame period might be put at about 90,000, making a total of400,000 in all.Moral of Troops.10. In continuation of War Cabinet 410, Minute 7, the atten-tion of the War Cabinet was called to certain criticisms of theBritish troops, which were being made in France. It was also pointed out that in the British Army there was, at times, a similarcriticism of the French Army.The War Cabinet were strongly of opinion that it was imperative that further criticisms of this nature shoidd be stopped, as theytended to sap the moral of the Armies.The War Cabinet decided that The cpiestion should be discussed personally with M. Clemenceauat the next convenient opportunity, with a view to thenecessary action being taken forthwith to check suchmutual criticism.United States 11. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to a telegramArmy- (No. 2139, dated 13th May, 1918) from Lord Reading, in which he stated that a very difficult situation had arisen in the United Statesowing to the publication in the American press, from a Canadiansource, of what purported to be an expression of the views of theBritish Government relative to the formation of the American army for use on the Western front.Upon investigation, it appeared that the War Office, like otherDepartments, prepared a Weekly Summary as to the generalsituation, for the guidance of the Ministry of Information, and. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that the Bulgarians had withdrawn nine battalions from theDobrudja and were transferring them to the Monastir front. this made a total of 250 battalions on the Salonica front, of which onlyfive were now composed of German troops. He mentioned thatthis, in itself, did not necessarily mean that they intended to carryout an offensive against us on that front.
Strike on a transport.that from these sum ma vies the Ministry of Information composeda communication which was widely distributed.In the particular case in question a subordinate official of theMinistry of Information had misapprehended the War Office note,and his resume of it had been &quot;grossly inaccurate and misleading,since he had applied to conditions of to-day a sentence which, inthe original document, referred to the totally different conditions ofa year or more ago, when America entered the war.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Minister of Information should take the necessary action in relation to the official responsible for thisblunder, and such further action as was necessary toprevent the recurrence of similar mistakes ;(o.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should send atelegram to Lord Reading in the sense that the telegram sent to Ottawa did not emanate from the War cabinet and did not represent their views, and authorising lord reading to repudiate it in the strongest terms. At thesame time, Lord Reading should be informed confi-dentially that the mistake arose owing to a blunder onthe part of a subordinate in the Ministry of Information,who omitted a vital passage in a War Office apprecia-tion which referred to the situation which existed twelvemonths ago ;(c.) The Secretary of State for the Colonies should send an explanatory telegram to the Prime Ministers of theDominions, giving similar information to that sent toLord Reading.Vladivostock: 12. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that information hadCzech Troops. been received from H.M.S.  &quot;Suffolk&quot; that the total number ofCzech troops now at Vladivostock was 10,000.The Adriatic, 13. The Deputy First Sea Lord informed the &quot;War Cabinet that two Italian motor-boats attacked an enemy transport which wasentering the port of Durazzo on the night of the 12th-13th May,that the transport was torpedoed and sunk, and that it was believedthat one escorting torpedo-boat was hit by a torpedo.14. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that the British steamer&quot; Kursk &quot; had left America for a French port, manned by seventy-three ratings of PI.M.S. &quot; Devonshire,&quot; assisted by United states troops on board, the reason being that the crew had refused duty and were demanding a 50 per cent, increase of wages. He addedthat the crew were under arrest with a view7 to trial under theDefence of the Realm Regulations on the arrival of the vessel inEngland.Bombing Kaid.15. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that Bruges clocks hadbeen bombed on the previous night, and that bombs were seen to fall on the quays of the east and west basin. All the machinesreturned safelv.War Cabinet:WhitsuntideBecess.10. The War Cabinet decided that No Meetings of the War Cabinet, other than those that mightbe called for by an emergency, should take place on saturday, the 18th May; Monday, the 20th May; andTuesday, the 21 st May.
Ee-affbrestation.Imperial War-Cabinet :Agenda.IS. The War Cabinet appointed the following Committee toprepare the Agenda for the Imperial War Cabinet Lord Curzon [in the Chair),General Smuts,Mr. Long,Mr. Montagu,Lieutenant-Colonel L. S. Amery (Secretary).Defence of London 19. With reference to War Cabinet 355, Minute 11, the war against Air Cabinet had under consideration a memorandum by Lord Milner-Raicls- (Paper G.T.-4168,i and a report by Major-General Ashmore on theAir Defences of London.The late immunity of London from visitations by hostileaircraft was commented on. The Chief of the Air Staff said thatthis might be attributed to generally unfavourable weather, to thegreat expenditure of aerial effort on the Western front, and possibly to a feeling on the part of the enemy that long distance raids werenot worth the cost ; to these reasons might be added the fire atFriedrichshafen, which was believed to have destroyed a number oftwin-engine bombing machines.The Secretary of State for the Air said there was evidence ofgreat losses of aircraft by the enemy, to replace which squadronsspecially designed for raiding England were being used for localoperations on the front in France. From the 21st March to the12th May 570 enemy aeroplanes had been destroyed and 239 drivendown out of control in the battle zone. The average number of machines put out of action had risen, since the start of the battle,from no more than 50 a week to 110.The Chief of the Air Staff added that for the needs of the presentbattle all German aviation units had been withdrawn from the Italiantheatre, and a number of reconnaissance units brought from theEastern front. The number of flights identified in the battle zonehad doubled since the beginning of the battle ; units had been drawn from the quieter parts of the front; 75 per cent, of the enemy forma-tions on the Western front were employed in the battle, and, accordingto prisoners, there was difficulty in keeping up establishments.General Ashmore, with the aid of a map, described inconsiderable detail the existing scheme of defence for London. he expressed the view that the measures adopted rendered a successful attack on the capital by day very unlikely.An account was given by the Secretary of State for the Air andthe Minister of Munitions, of the various devices in use, or in course of development, for locating hostile aircraft by night. Fornocturnal defence our resources were steadily improving. Thoughthe full establishment postulated as necessary to repel an attack ingreat force had not been reached, the position Avas neverthelesssatisfactory. Sir William Weir said that the requirements of thedefence were being fulfilled gradually, and that he hoped theprogramme would be completed by the end of September.The Minister of Munitions expressed some doubt of the urgency of certain items in the list of requirements stated inGeneral Ashmore&apos;s memorandum, and the Secretary of State for theAir pointed out that some scheme of priority would have to beestablished in respect to claims for the output of material.17. With reference to War Cabinet 380, Minute 17, the WarCabinet, in view of Lord milner&apos;s appointment as Secretary of Statefor War, requested Lord Curzon to take Lord Milner&apos;s place in the enquiriesremitted jointly to Lord Milner and Mr. Barnes.
The War Cabinet approved the general arrangements for thedefence of London, and invited the Departments concerned to confer, on the initiation of the Secretary of State forthe Air, concerning the completion of the programme, withreference to the relative urgency of these requirements andthose of other Services, and to report to the Cabinet.Poison Bombs. 20. The possibility that the enemy might drop poison bombs on London was referred to, and General Thuillier expressed theopinion that, although this may be done for the purpose ofterrorisation, there was no evidence that lethal bombs of this kind would be more destructive than high-explosive bombs. Experi-ments were being made. It seemed at present, however, that an equal weight of explosives would produce greater results. there appeared no special necessity for defensive measures, which in anycase were not easy to devise, against this contingency.It Avas suggested that General Thuillier should confer with theauthorities in charge of the Eire Brigade.GeneralTrencharcVsAppointment.21. In connection with bombing, it was mentioned that GeneralTrenchard had been appointed to an independent command of the bombing squadrons in France.Weekly Beportfrom Air Ministry.22. The Secretary of State for the Air stated that arrangements were being made to furnish the War Cabinet with a weekly reporton aerial matters.Prisoners of War:Beprisals.Representation ofthe People Act.Life of Parliament.Preparation ofNew Register.23. With reference to War Cabinet 393, Minute 21, the WarCabinet had under consideration a memorandum by lord milner onthe subject of reprisals in the case of prisoners of war (Paper G.T.-4404).Lord Milner said that, while the memorandum suggestedforms which reprisals might take, all protests against brutalities towhich our men were subjected having proved useless, yet, person-ally, he was averse from any hasty action being taken. Reprisalshad been taken in isolated cases when the &apos;Germans had harshlytreated British prisoners for offences such as dropping leaflets, &amp;c,and in these cases the results had been successful.It was pointed out that, under the present circumstances, itwould be inadvisable to employ prisoners of war on the western front within the 30-kilometre limit,The War Cabinet decided that The War Office should be left to exercise their discretion in thematter.24. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandumby the President of the Local Government Board (Paper G.T.-4509) with reference to the life of Parliament and the preparationof a new register under the terms of the Representation of thePeople Act, 1918.The President of the Local Government Board said that the franchise under the Act was very complicated ; that the electorsin England had found great difficulty in correctly completing thepink forms, and that it was necessary for a house-to-house canvassto be held. If the time given for the preparation of the new registerwere not extended, Mr. Hayes Fisher was of opinion that, while, underthe Act, millions had been enfranchised, hundreds of: thousands ofnames would be omitted from the register. He pointed out that it was intended by the War Office and the Admiralty to send postcards to all
soldiers and sailors serving at home and abroad, which, when filledup, would considerably assist the overseers in the compilation of theregister ; but, up to the present, owing to the operations which were taking place in France, none of these postcards had yet been dispatched, either to the Home forces or to the forces abroad, by theWar Office. One of the chief difficulties was that it was only possible tocanvass properly in the evening, and that some local authorities hadnot been able to obtain the services of competent canvassers for this duty. In his opinion, the register, if it were to be completed by the 1st October, would be a very imperfect one. The date forthe publication of the lists was the 15th June, which meant that therewas only one more month in which canvassers could be used to collect and correct the forms, which had been issued.The Secretary for Scotland said that not only had there been nodifficulty in Scotland, but that the assessors had intimated to him that they did not desire to have the date altered. It was true thatthe qualification for the Local Government vote was different inScotland, but the qualification for the Parliamentary vote was thesame. With regard to sailors and soldiers, Mr. Munro expressed theopinion that it would be of great assistance if the postcards sent outby the Admiralty and War Office could be returned filled up beforethe completion of the register.Mr. Hayes Fisher pointed out that the problem for Scotland,with seventy seats, was much easier than that for England andWales, with some 500 seats.Sir Walter Jerred said that the War Office had not sent out thepostcards to the troops serving at home, and that the Local Govern-ment Board had impressed upon that Department the necessity forthe despatch of these cards. Yesterday he had been informed thatthey would now be sent out to all the Home Forces and to the troopsserving in France. One of the principal difficulties lay in printing,and he was afraid that the lists would not be ready by the15th June and that they would be very inaccurate-Mr. Munro pointed out with regard to the printing that he had had the same difficulty in Scotland, where the local printers had putforward estimates for the printing so high that he could not accept them.   He had therefore authorised the typewriting of lists.Mr. Bonar Law said that, on political grounds, he would preferan incomplete register to any postponement of the date on whichthe register should be ready. Pie pointed out that the fact that noelection was possible owing to the lack of a register made thepolitical position of the Government more difficult every day.The Prime Minister, in agreeing with Mr. Bonar Law, said thatwhen an election was not possible owing to the lack of a properregister, not only was the Government at the mercy of the differentfactions, but that it was embarrassed and hampered in its actionwhen it was not in a position to say that it would appeal to thecountry for a decision..Lord Curzon pointed out that, at any rate, a new Bill wouldhave to be introduced for the prolongation of Parliament, which,under the terms of the last Act, came to an end on the 31st Julynext.The War Cabinet decided that    &apos;The President of the Local Government Board shotdcl convene a conference between the Secretary for Scotland and repre-sentatives of the War Office to discuss the best methods of expediting the preparation of the register ; and that, ifunable to agree that it was possible for the register to becompleted on the date laid down in the Order in Council,the President of the Local Government Board should lay a report of the Conference before the War Cabinet,
Austria:Emperor Karl&apos;sLetter.25. The War Cabinet had a short discussion as to the attitude to be adopted in the House of Commons towards the question of theEmperor KaiTs letter, which is to be raised on the motion for the adjournment.As the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had left themeeting, no final decision was taken, but the general view was expressed that the best course would be to adhere to our previousattitude, and to decline to discuss the question in detail, but to draw attention to the published results of the Secret Enquiry by theFrench Foreign Affairs Commission.Soldiers&apos; and sailors&apos; pay committee.26. With reference to War Cabinet 364, Minute 13, the WarCabinet had under consideration the Fifth and supplementary report of the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; Pay Committee, presided overby Sir Edward Carson, with reference to the equalisation of navy and Army Separation Allowances (Paper G.-207).The War Cabinet approved the Report, and desired to place on record their appreciation of the services of Sir edward carson as chairman of the Committee.Ireland. 27. With reference to War Cabinet 407, Minute 5, Mr. WalterLong informed the War Cabinet that he had been in telephonic com-munication with the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland on the subject ofthe steps which Lord French proposed to take in order to deal withthe present situation in Ireland.In view of the absence from the Cabinet of General Smuts andMr. Barnes (who had already left the Meeting), the War cabinet decided To defer discussion on this question until the following day.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 14, 1918.o
