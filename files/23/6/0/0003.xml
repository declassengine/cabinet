THE Director of Military Operations reported that localFront, fighting only had taken place on the Western front, and that a localoperation north of the Somme had given the British troops possessionof Ayette. On the rest of the front all was quiet. On Monday afternoon, General Maurice stated, General Foch had described thesituation on the whole battle-front to him, and had said that north of the Somme and along the Oise the whole line had been stabilised,and that between Lassigny and the Somme his immediate object was to check the enemy and stabilise that part of the battle front. Itmight now be said that complete stabilisation had been achieved.With regard to the relative number of troops now on the battle-front, General Maurice stated that there were in line 59 german divisions, which had all been engaged, and that, while it was difficult,under present circumstances, to obtain accurate information, it was believed that there were 3b German divisions immediately in reserve,of which 12 were fresh divisions. With regard to the Allied troops,.[1365-381]
there were 30 French and British divisions in the line and 22divisions in reserve. Of the 30 divisions in the line, 18 were fresh divisions ; and of the 22 in reserve, 1.1 were fresh and 11 weretired divisions.With regard to the French dispositions, 14 divisions were in line on the battle-front, while 11 were in reserve, (if which 8 werefresh. En route for the battle-zone, General Maurice said that therewere 19 French divisions, which included 2 from Italy, and thathy the 7th April the French would have 44 divisions on the battle-front, and the British divisions would number 27, or possibly 28.With regard to the quiet fronts of the line, the French had53 divisions, with 5 in reserve, and the British 16 divisions with18 in reserve. Of these 18 divisions, there was one fresh division,7 belonged to the Vth Army, which might take several months tore-organise, and 10 were tired divisions, which would be of littleassistance for some considerable time.It was pointed out that, taking all these numbers into con-sideration, the Germans would have available, by the 7th April,95 divisions, whilst the Allied troops would have on the battle-frontonly 72.General Maurice expressed the opinion that it could not beconsidered certain that ail the German divisions would be availablefor an attack in the future, and that the inequality of numbers wasnot so great as appeared on paper : it was probable that a certainnumber of the German divisions in reserve were only waiting to be withdrawn.In reply to a question as to the possibility of future attacks,General Maurice said that Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig wasanticipating that an attack would be made in the vicinity of Arras,as it had been ascertained that the Germans had not withdrawntheir reserves from this portion of the line. General Maurice was ofopinion that the reason why an attack would not be concentrated on the southern portion of the battle-front was that there was veryconsiderable congestion in rear of the German lines, and that gravedifficulty had been experienced in bringing up heavy artillery,mainly owing to the fact that the Illrd Army, during its retirement,had carried out very successful demolitions of the lines of com-munication, more particularly in creating large craters on the arras-Bapaume road, which were being kept continuously undershell-fire. The enemy would therefore ,only maintain a certainnumber of divisions on the southern battle-front, and he would beable to attack the Arras front with troops he would not employsouth of the Somme.Questioned as to why the French army was not taking-advantage of their present situation for a counter-offensive on thesouth-eastern line of the battle-front, General Maurice pointed outthat the French troops were brought up in a great hurry in themiddle of a severe battle ; that they consequently had to travel verylight, and without a large amount of their artillery ; and that theyhad been put into the line with the main object of consolidating it.The object which General Foch had in view was, not to make any counter-offensive until the line had been stabilised, which had nowbeen done.2. The Director of Military Operations was questioned as tothe present strength of the Turkish army. General Maurice statedthat it was divided into two groups, one of Avhich was in the Cau-casus and one in Palestine, with about four weak Turkish divisions on the Tigris. On the Euphrates there had never been more thanone division, which had practically ceased to exist.
3. With regard to our present position in Palestine, it waspointed out that, according to the latest information, the Britishtroops had advanced to Amman, where the railway line had been cut ; that a retirement had been made on Es Salt ; and that thetroops were moving back to the Jordan.The opinion was expressed that it would he very unfortunate if the British troops withdrew west of the Jordan, as, in that case,an impression would be spread among the Arabs that the british forces had been compelled to withdraw, and that the British move-ment towards Amman had been ineffectual.The Director of Military Operations pointed out that general allenby had always said that he did not intend to do more than tomake a raid on Amman, but that, in order that the situation in this area might be clearly ascertained, a telegram had been despatchedthe previous clay asking for the necessary information.The War Cabinet requested The Director of Military Operations to report the answer of theGeneral Officer Commanding in &quot;Chief, Egypt, as soon asit was received.2, Whitehall.
