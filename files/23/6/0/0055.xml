THE War Cabinet had before them a letter from the FrenchCharge d&apos;Affaires to Lord; Hardinge, under cover of a note byMr. Balfour, together with correspondence between Lord Milner andLord Hardinge, with regard to, the possible enlistment of Irishmenin the French, army (Paper G.T.-4808).The War Cabinet were agreed that while, from the point ofview of man-power, it would be desirable to allow Irishmen to enlistin the French army, either in a special Irish Brigade or in theForeign Legion, there were, on the other hand, weighty political objections to the proposal.The War Cabinet decided that M. de Fleuriau should be informed that no objection would beraised if such Irishmen as privately offered themselves,were enlisted.
Ireland:      ^ 2. With reference to War Cabinet 421, Minute 6, the WarHome Rute Bill        Cabinet had before them the folio wins: documents : and Conscription.Interim Report of the Committee on Government of IrelandBill (Paper G.T.-4839) ;Memoranda by Mr. Long (Papers G.T.-4728 and 4882);Memorandum by Mr. Chamberlain on the Irish Question andFederalism (Paper G.-212).Lord Curzon stated that in the House of Lords on the following day the policy of the Government in relation to Ireland would heraised, and it was necessary that he should be in a position torepresent the views of the War Cabinet. He would probably he asked to explain why the Government^ declared intentions of proceeding with conscription and a Home Rule Bill had not beencarried out. To that question a perfectly satisfactory answer couldbe given on the lines set out by Mr. Long in his memoranda to theWar Cabinet. But a further question would be put: granted therewas good ground for not proceeding with conscription and a HomeBule Bill at present, were these measures only temporarily in abeyance, or had the Government decided to drop them indefinitely ?Reference would probably be made to the speeches delivered inApril by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House, and theGovernment might be charged with having departed from the policytherein laid down.Mr. Balfour thought it should not be impossible to say that theGovernment had made a mistake as to the conditions in Irelandwhen they announced their intention of proceeding with bothmeasures ; that they had decided, on learning how grave those conditions were, that their first duty was to restore respect for lawand order in Ireland, and that until this was done it was undesirable to outline any programme for the future.Mr. Long said that, with reference to the speeches delivered bythe Prime Minister and Mr. Bonar Law, the impression left upon theHouse was that conscription coidd and would shortly be put intoeffect, but that the preliminary arrangements would necessarily take some time. In the meantime a Home Rule Bill would be prepared and introduced, and would go through the usual processof discussion in the two Houses. It was understood to be part of the dual policy that, if they failed to pass the Home Rule Bill, the Governmentwould resign.The Prime Minister said that the view of the War Cabinet onthe point just mentioned by Mr. Long had been that, if conscriptionhad been put in force and a Home Rule Bill were defeated, then theGovernment would resign. When this decision was reached, theWar Cabinet thought that there was sufficient general agreement,although in certain quarters it might be no more than sullenassent, to carry a Home Rule measure. Since then two things had happened. The first was the discovery of a grave Sinn Fein con-spiracy, in which the real leaders of Irish opinion men likede Valera and Arthur Griffith-were involved. The programme ofthe conspirators was timed to coincide with a great German offensive,which woidd menace the existence of the British army The secondfactor in the situation was the challenge to the Imperial supremacythrown down by the Roman Catholic Church, on an issue whichhitherto had always been assumed to rest solely in the sphere ofthe Imperial Government, it was impossible to ignore these twofacts, for an essential condition of legislation in wTar-time was thatthere should be substantial agreement between the main parties inthe State. Two or three months ago liberals would have warmly welcomed a Home Rule Bill, and many Unionists would havetolerated it as a war measure, but there had been so great a changein the political climate that he did not think a Home Rule Bill couldbe carried now.Mr. Barnes agreed that it was not possible to pass a Home
Rule Bill at present, and the Prime Ministers argument was con-clusive on that point ; but he suggested that the production of aHome Rule Bill, even if not proceeded with, would tend to improve relations with Ireland, and it would be possible to obtain Irishopinion upon it.Sir Gordon Hewart thought the Government would be chargedwith insincerity if they merely produced a Bill without any seriousintention of proceeding with it.Mr. Long pointed out that many in the House of Commons had reluctantly assented to a Home Rule Bill because they understoodthat on that condition they could get conscription applied to Ireland ;but now conscription was postponed by the action of the Cabinet,and it was, therefore, idle to go on with the Home Rule Bill. Onthe other hand, if voluntary recruiting proved to be a failure, theGovernment would be pressed as to their further intentions. ManyUnionists maintained that one of the most serious defects of theBritish policy in Ireland was that the Irish were kept in suspenseas to what that policy really was. Ireland was perhaps sufferingto-day more from suspense than from anything else.Mr. Herbert Fisher said that, if it was the intention to putconscription in force in October, then it was important that theHome Rule Bill should be ready.The Prime Minister concurred, and pointed out that in his speech on the 9th April he had argued that it would be impossibleto carry conscription without stern measures ; that such sternmeasures could not be applied without support, not only in Ireland,but in America and in this country ; and that such support couldnot be obtained, especially from the Labour party, without a measureof Home Rule. The Government policy had thus been: If wecannot carry Home Rule we cannot carry conscription. In explain-ing the action of-the Government, he would assume that they stoodby their policy, and would draw special attention to the recent developments in the government of Ireland. Formerly Ireland hadbeen largely governed from London. Now Ireland was beinglargely governed from Dublin, and the powers of the Irish Govern-ment had been increased. The first action of the new IrishGovernment had been to suppress the Sinn Fein conspiracy. Thenthey had advised the War Cabinet to make an experiment involuntary recruiting, and the Cabinet had accepted that advice. Ifhe were directly challenged as to whether the Government stoodby their dual policy he would reply in the affirmative, but would add that the time and method of giving effect to it must be judgedby the War Cabinet.Dr. Addison said that the difficulty in declaring that theGovernment stood by its policy lay in the fact that there was, as yet, no agreed Home Rule Bill, and no decision had been cometo on the proposed Federal solution, which he was increasinglydisposed to favour.Mr. Chamberlain made a strong, appeal in favour of theadoption of the Federal principle. Otherwise, he said, it was notpossible to secure a non-contentious measure. The ground hadbeen so often explored, and was so thoroughly well known, that every proposition in a Home Ride Bill would be controverted, andwith good reason, for the Bill would be founded on no logical basis.Devolution was as important to the other parts of the UnitedKingdom as to Ireland, and it would, at any rate, be some advantage to have to fight on new ground. The new Bill, as atpresent drafted, took away a great part of the measure already on the Statute Book, and would be certain to arouse, fierceopposition. The Federal principle, on the other hand, was receivingincreasing support from some of the best men in all parties. Itwas probably true that a Federal Bill would not be acceptable tothe Nationalists, but they would acquiesce in it, and at least their case for agitation would have disappeared.
- The Prime Minister said that he was about to receive adeputation on the subject of Federalism, composed of Membersof Parliament drawn from the different political parties, and,before coming to a decision, it would he better to hear whatviews were put forward, and what support they commanded.It might then be worth considering whether, in the interval,while voluntary1&apos;recruiting was being tried, a Committee of theHouse of Commons, or a Joint Committee of both Houses, mightnot consider the problem of Federalism.The War Cabinet decided that Lord Curzon, in his speech,(a.) Should proceed on the assumption that the dual; policy had not been abandoned, although theGovernment must  be the judge of the timeand method of its application ; and(6.) Should state the reasons, as set forth above, whythe dual policy of the Government was for thetime in abeyance.The War Cabinet further decided To adjourn the consideration of Federalism until after thePrime Minister had received the deputation referred to,and the War Cabinet had had an opportunity of learningits views and the &quot;support they were likely to secure.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 20, 1918.o
