THE Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff said therewas nothing to report as regards the Western front, save that theFrench success in&apos; the vicinity of Kemmel was very helpful.Questioned as to whether there was any indication of an attack bythe Germans in that vicinity, he stated that the present view wasthat no attack was likely either on that portion of the front or elsewhere on the Western front in the immediate future.The Director of Military Intelligence stated that he sent anofficer yesterday to General Headquarters, and he had reported that though, there was activity all. along the battle front, there were no signs of an immediate attack on any particular section of the british front, and that the anticipated attack on the part of the germans in the vicinity of La Bassee Canal had apparently been aban-abandoned for the moment. The view was held, at General Head-quarters that the next main attack would probably take place from north of the Somme up to the vicinity of Arras. His own view wasthat the Germans would be well advised to put off their offensivefor, say, another fortnight. At the present moment they had 19divisions available for roidement, 12 fresh divisions in reserve, and23 divisions which had been a month or more out of the line,
making a total of 54 available. In addition to these 23 there were48 more German divisions resting, and, if they waited until some ofthese 48 divisions had been refreshed, they would have availablerather more divisions for an offensive than they had on the21st March. As against these, the British had 16 divisions in reserve on the Western front, and the French had 88; the americans had 2, and the Italians I in reserve, making a totalof 57 divisions. Further, the French had 41 divisions in quietparts of the line, some of which would be available for roulement.As regards the sum total of divisions on the Western front, but not including the Belgians, the French and British had 155 divisions,the United States 5, and the Italians 2 divisions a total of 162against 208 German divisions.In reply to a question as to whether the situation was betternow than on the 21st March, Lord Milner stated that our dis-positions were better than they were on that date, but that our total strength was less, namely, about 4 to the Germans&apos; 5, andconsequently our potential reserves were reduced.General Harington confirmed this view, and pointed out thata number of our divisions had had a hard time, and that, although they had been brought up to strength, the training of the replenisheddivisions left much to be desired, inasmuch as General Foch wouldnot allow them to be withdrawn from the line to the training centres,and training whilst in or close behind the front line presented serious difficulties. As regards the United States troops, General Haringtonstated that they were now being put into such of our divisions ashad been reduced to cadre, but that lack of training was evidentas regards their officers and staffs.The Italian Front, 2. The Director of   Military Intelligence reported  that two additional Austrian divisions had been sent to the Austrian front,making a total of h\\ divisions in all on that front. The latest information from Lord Cavan was to the effect that there was no indication as to any increase of offensive preparations on the part ofthe enemy. General Macdonogh was of opinion that, if any attackwere made, it was likely to take place astride the Brenta.Mesopotamia. 3. The Director of Military Intelligence informed the War Cabinetthat General Marshall had made a cavalry advance to Fatha, on the tigris, with the result that the Turks had retired to Kara Djebaar.The result of General MarshalPs recent operations had been that theAzerbaijan Turkish force had been reduced from 3,600 if lies to2.500, 1,100 rifles having been withdrawn from that force to reinforce the Turks on the Zab and Tigris. General Macdonogh stated thatthe Turkish forces on the Tigris, north of Fatha, now amountedto only about 5,700 rifles. A large part of the Turkish force was now in Palestine. His estimate of the total Turkish force now only amounted to about 120,000 rifles.East Africa. 4. General Macdonogh stated that our columns were closing inon von Lettow&apos;s force, and indicated on a map the action that hadbeen taken to deal with it.Maintenance of the 5. Lord Milner drew the attention of the War Cabinet to aArmy in France. memorandum (Paper G.T.-45U8) he had circulated with reference tothe maintenance of the army in France, and added that the WarOffice was being pressed by the Commander-in-Chief of the allied forces to make up our cadre divisions, and to do all in our power toprevent the breaking tip of units which are essential for theroidement required to release French divisions.   Lord Milner pointed
oout that the only way in which it is possible to obtain men for this purpose is, (1) by the reduction of troops now available for home Defence, and (2) to take men from the Labour and Employ-ment Companies. By these means the following would beobtained: (a.) 4,500 &quot;A&quot; men.(b.) 20,000 &quot; B. I &quot; men (nearly &quot; A &quot; men).(c) 60,000 low category &quot; B. I &quot; and &quot; B. II &quot; men.Of the above, those under (a) and (6) would be used as draftsfor our fighting or front line divisions, and (c) would be used tomake up cadre divisions in order that the latter may be employedon quiet parts of the French front.The War Cabinet approved the proposals of the Chief of theImperial General Staff as set out in Paper G.T.-4598.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 23, 1918.
