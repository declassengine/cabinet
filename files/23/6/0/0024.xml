The Western Front. 1. THE Director of Military Intelligence reported that thesituation was unchanged, and that no attacks had taken place thismorning. There had been considerable activity on the Meteren-Ypres front, and the French had slightly improved their position atKrabbenhof Farm, north-east of Locre.Questioned as to the number of German divisions which were taking part in the operations against the British forces in theneighbourhood of Ypres, General Macdonogh stated that, in theactual attack on the front from the Ypres-Comines Canal to St. JansCappel, the Germans had employed eight divisions or a total ofroughly 100,000 men.General Macdonogh said that on the French front the germans had made an attack on Mont Renaud, near Noyon, where they had gained a little ground. He understood that the French were goingto counter-attack, but no report had yet been received of the result.General Macdonogh said that, of the German divisions engagedin the northern operations, three more divisions bad been put in north of La Bassee, which gave a total of forty-three divisionsengaged in this area, of which thirty-five were fresh and eight hadalready been in action.In the southern area, two fresh German divisions had been identified at Villers-Bretonneux, one of which was a Jagerdivision from Italy, and the other the 109th Division, which had come from Roumania. This made up a total of 104 divisions in this area. The Germans had now 16 fresh divisions in reserve, and 23good divisions which were available for roulement, making a totalof 39. In addition to these, there were still 6 good, and 7 fair,divisions on the Eastern front, which were likely to be brought tothe West, and might even now be on their way.Questioned as to the part of the line on which the next bigattack of the Germans was likely to be made, the Director of military intelligence expressed the opinion that the Germans would probablyattack in the neighbourhood of Villers-Bretonneux, as this was themost dangerous point in the Allied line, being a very short distance from Amiens. It was quite probable that this attack would be on abig front, which might reach from Albert to Montdidier, but it wasimpossible to say anything definitely on this subject. All expertmilitary opinion pointed to the fact that a German attack on a large scale, down the Somme Valley with the object of separating theAllied forces, was more dangerous than a similar attack in theneighbourhood of Ypres.Mesopotamia. 2. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that general marshall had now opposed to him on the Kerkuk-Suleimanieh frontabout 4,000 Turkish rifles. General MarshalTs force included onecavalry brigade and one British division, and he also had a small force as far as Hamad an.Attention was called to the danger threatened to Persia by theTurkish movement to Azerbaijan, and to the good effect which Avaslikely to ensue from General Marshalbs movement into the hills.The Director of Military Intelligence said that this was theobject which the Chief of the Imperial General Staff had in view inadvocating the movement, and that, if General Marshall occupiedKerkuk, the 6th Turkish Division, which had started from Erbil,might have to be diverted from the Azerbaijan direction. he pointed out that Kerkuk was an important supply centre, and thatits occupation would probably cut off a large portion of the Turkishsupplies,Censorship of 3.

4. With reference to War Cabinet 382, Minute S, attention was called to the fact that a statement had been made in parliament that an enquiry was being held with regard to the attack of theGermans on the 21st March and the retirement of the Vth Army.It was pointed out that it was very desirable that the War cabinet should be made acquainted with the steps which were being taken with regard to this enquiry.The War Cabinet decided that The Director of Military Intelligence should ascertain andreport to the War Cabinet on the following day.5. With reference to War Cabinet 198, Minute 11, attention was called to the fact that no report had been made by the WarOffice as to the enquiry on the conduct of officers mentioned in thereport of the Mesopotamia Commission.The War Cabinet requested  The Director of Military Intelligence to make a report on thissubject,Submarines. (3. With reference to War Cabinet 401, Minute 1, the deputy first Sea Lord reported that the German submarine U.B. 85 wassank by gunfire by .H.M. drifter &quot;Coreopsis II&quot; on the morning ofthe 30th April. The crew of 3 officers and 32 men surrendered tothe drifter (whose total crew consisted of 10 men), and had been landed at Lame.Admiral Hope reported that a submarine had been sunk offHartland Point on the 20th April. Two trawlers had&apos;located anobstruction in this position, and a further report would follow.The Deputy First Sea Lord added that a report had also beenreceived that on the 30th April, off Trevose Head, an enemy submarine was struck by gunfire, and then submerged. Elevendepth charges were dropped, and oil and bubbles were seen to cometo the surface.7. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that a bombing raidhad been carried out the previous day, from Dover, on Ostend.Eleven 230-lb. bombs were dropped close to the electric-powerhouse, but, owing to cloud and fog, the result could not be observed.Enquiry concerningRecent Battle:The Vth Army.The mesopotamia commission.Bombing Raid onOstend.Macdonogh also brought to the notice of the Cabinet the steps which had been taken by the War Office to circulate articles to theColonies on the subject of the doings of British troops, for publica-tion in. the colonial press. He stated that the process of providinginformation for the Colonies had been in operation for the past twoyears, and that the War Office had received most satisfactoryreports of the results.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Director of Military Intelligence should see the Secre-tary of State for the Colonies, and consult with himwhat steps could be taken to prevent the publication of letters -written by Australian troops in France containingreflections on the conduct of British troops.(6.) The Director of Military Intelligence should see theMinister of Information with regard to collaboration with him on the subject of providing information forthe colonial press as to the doings of British troops.
Future of Bussian 8. With reference to War Cabinet 400, Minute 11, the DeputyFleets. First Sea Lord said that the Naval Attache at Petrograd had reported that it had been suggested to Admiral Alfata thatammunition at Sebastopol and Kerch should be placed in Alliedships ready for destruction. In reply to offers of assistance,Admiral Alfata had stated that no Mission, of whatever nationality,was of any use at present, as, under existing conditions, the futureof the Black Sea fleet must be left to run its natural course,,Admiral Hope said that he had received a report from Mudros tothe effect that Admiral Sablin, appointed by M. Trotzki, announced on 30th April that he was in command of the Black Sea fleet, andthat the fleet and the fort of Sebastopol were now under the Ukraineflag. Admiral Sablin had proposed to hold a conference withGeneral von Koch, the commander of the German troops in the crimea.The opinion was expressed that this news was serious, not only from a naval point of view, but also from the point of view that ithad a sinister significance as to the attitude of the Bolsheviks. Itwas possible, however, that M. Trotzki might have been betrayedby Admiral Sablin in hoisting the Ukraine flag.The War Cabinet.decided that-(//.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should communicate to Mr. Lockhart the above information.(b.) The Admiralty should forward this information to theFirst Sea Lord, in order that he might bring the facts tothe notice of the Supreme War Council.Vladivostock. 9. Bear-Admiral Hope informed the War Cabinet that a telegram had been received from H.M.S. &quot; Suffolk,&quot; at Vladivostock, to theeffect that order in the town continued satisfactory, owing to theprotection afforded by the landing party. The prospects of formingan efficient police force were small on account of lack of funds anddivision of authority. The Red Guards organised by the Sovietwere largely composed of criminals, and those placed in Govern-ment offices had in several instances absconded with the cash.Bolshevik tyranny continued to arouse general resentment. Accordingto reliable information, the movement in favour of an autonomousSiberia, headed by so-called Siberian Government elected in Tomsk,was making marked progress among the population, especially in country districts. Their representatives were in Peking solicitingthe support of Allied Governments.The War Cabinet requested The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to communicate this information also to Mr. Lockhart.Employment of 10. With reference to War Cabinet 401, Minute 9, the DeputyCzech Troops. First Sea Lord reported that the Captain of H.M.S. &quot; Suffolk &quot; had telegraphed to the effect that 4,000 Czech troops had arrived at vladivostock, and were awaiting transport to France, and that he understood that 50,000 of these troops altogether were coming to&quot;Vladivostock.The Director of Military Intelligence said that this informationconfirmed news which he had received the previous day from Frenchsources, that about 6,000 Czech troops had arrived at Vladivostockand that a similar number were expected to arrive every two daysuntil the full number of 50,000 had been made up. These troops were at Vladivostock because they refused to fight in Russia, andwere awaiting transport to elsewhere. It was presumed that thewhole of the 1st Czech Corps, which, according to the latest infor-mation last week, were then, in European Russia, had now movedeast of Omsk, and were therefore in Siberia. The Director ofMilitary Intelligence stated that these troops, the equivalent of a
Proposed mission to the United StatesAmerica.1. Attention was called -to telegram No.from LordHorse-Racing :Oats for Horses.Reading, on the subject of a proposed Mission to America, headed by Sir Lynden Macassey, which was due to leave on the following day.In view of the opinion expressed by Lord Reading that it wasinadvisable for this Mission to be sent, the War Cabinet decidedthat The Admiralty should immediately issue instructions to delay the starting of the members composing the Mission, until there had been an opportunity of consulting the PrimeMinister on the subject.12. With reference to War Cabinet 297, Minute IS, the WarCabinet had under consideration a question asked in the House ofCommons by Mr. Of. Lambert on the subject of the continuation of horse-racing, and the reply of the Chancellor of the exchequer that this question should be brought forward for the considerationof the War Cabinet at an early date (House of Commons Debates,Vol. 105, No. 31, Cols. 398/9).Sir John Beale, who represented the Food Controller, saidthat the qualities of grain involved were not very large, and onlyapproximated to an amount of 5,000 tons a year. It would benecessary in the immediate future, however, in view of the shortageof oats, to import oats for feeding-stuffs for pigs and transporthorses. It was, in his opinion, a psychological question as towhether it was advisable to continue using oats for race-horses.Sir Daniel Hall, who represented the President of the Board ofAgriculture and Fisheries, said that he agreed that this was apsychological question, and that his Department was continuouslymet with arguments from, farmers that it was not necessaiy to restrict them in their purchases of oats for feeding-stuffs if it was still possible to allow good oats for race-horses. It was explained to the farmers that the amount of oats used for this purpose was less than 1 per cent, of the quantity available between the1st January and next August, and less than J per cent, of thetotal concentrated cattle foods ; but there was undoubtedly a con-siderable amount of feeling amongst the farmers on this question.The President of the Board of Trade said that the railway executive Committee had been raising objections to race-meetings.It was pointed out that while, from the point of view of Depart-ments concerned, objections to horse-racing could naturally be putforward, the question of the stoppage of horse-racing raised many other matters which demanded careful consideration.The War Cabinet decided that The President of the Board of Trade, the President of the Boardof Agriculture and Fisheries, the Food Controller, and theWar Office, should prepare a joint note on the question ofthe advisability of the continuance of horse-racing, for theconsideration of the War Cabinet.[1305-402]CCorps, asserted that they had been so badly treated in Russia thatthey refused to fight there, but that a second Czech Corps was inthe process of formation in the neighbourhood of Omsk, in which already some 20,000 men had m been enrolled, and that it was probable that arrangements could be made for this Corps to remainin Russia and be stationed, as was originally proposed, on the murmansk and Archangel railways.The War Cabinet decided that The Admiralty should telegraph to the Captain of H.M.S.&quot; Suffolk,&quot; requesting him to keep the Admiralty fully informed of the arrivals of Czech troops at Vladivostock.
Restrictions onTravelling by railway.13. The War Cabinet had before them memoranda by thePresident of the Board of Trade, outlining certain proposals for thereduction of travel on the railways, and notifying the War cabinet of the results of wage negotiations which had recently taken place between the Railway Executive Committee, the National Union of railwaymen, and the Associated Society of Locomotive engineers and Firemen (Papers G.T.-4353 and 4392).Sir Albert Stanley explained that drastic steps for the regulation and restriction of travel had become imperative. On certain linestrains were regularly overcrowded ; it was no longer possible insome districts, like the South Coast and the Thames Valley, to carryall the passengers who desired to ride. The congestion was due, onthe one hand, to the exodus from London on account of air raids and tothe withdrawal of a considerable number of trains. The train service was now about half what it was in pre-war clays. This reductionhad become necessary because the withdrawal of coastal shipping-entailed the use of locomotives for the corresponding increase ofgoods traffic, because of the difficulty of finding material wherewithto repair locomotives, partly also in the interests of coal economy,and partly, but in a less degree, as the result of the calling up of men for the army. He proposed, if the War Cabinet approved, to givethe Railway Executive Committee considerable powers to deal withthe situation, district by district, as required locally, beginning with london. The proposals dealt principally with the restrictions ofthe issue of season tickets under certain conditions, and were setforth in the memorandum. They were the result of much consulta-tion with the railway authorities, and, while considerable hardshipwould undoubtedly be caused to the general public, there was no alternative, inasmuch as the railways could not cany all who wishedto travel. It was not proposed to touch workmen&apos;s fares, but therewould have to be a diminution in the number of Governmentwarrants issued. Negotiations on the latter point were proceeding with the Departments concerned.In reply to a question, Sir Albert Stanley stated that the rolling-stock was steadily deteriorating, and that there were atpresent more than 4,000 locomotives idle and waiting for repairs.This was a matter of material rather than of labour. There was not enough steel to go round. The Ministry of Munitions wrere doing what they could to help, but they Avere, of course, confronted withthe competing claims for steel for ships, for tairks, and other urgentwar uses. He agreed that a point might soon be reached at whichit would be necessary to give locomotives precedence OA^er warmaterial.The War Cabinet decided To approve the proposals of the President of the Board of trade as set forth in his memoradum (Paper G.T.-4392), and requested him to submit to the War Cabinet a report onthe present condition of the railways&apos; rolling-stock in thiscountry.Trade Boards Bill.14. The War Cabinet had before them a draft of a Bill toamend the Trade Boards Act, 1909, together with a covering-memorandum by the Minister of Labour (Paper G.T.-4332).Mr. Roberts explained that most of the principal changesembodied in the Bill were based on the recommendations of theSub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee on the Employmentof Women. The Bill gave power to the Minister of Labour to setup Trade Boards by special orders instead of by means of a provisional Order Bill. It allowed the Minister to set up a trade board in any industry, having regard to the rate of wages, andnot only in those industries where wages could be shown to be&quot; exceptionally low.&quot; He had been in touch with employers whohad had experience of the working of the Trade Boards Act, 1909,
and they were all in favour of the proposed extension, as also werethe Trade Unions.Mr. Roberts said it was very desirable to extend the Boards, inview of difficult wage problems in connection with the employmentof women which would arise during the period of demobilisation.Mr. Bridgeman added, it was important that the extension shouldtake place, in view of the developments recommended by the whitley report.The War Cabinet authorised The Minister of Labour to proceed with the introduction of theBill.Man-Power: 15. With reference to War Cabinet 397, Minute 8, the WarMilitary Service       Cabinet took note of the proclamation prepared by the Minister ofActs, 1916-1918.     National Service for calling up men born in the years 1872 and1873 (Paper G.T.-4404).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 1, 1918.
