THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, up todate, we had not identified any divisions of Prince Rupprecht&apos;s army as having taken part in the present offensive. Prince Rupprechthimself to-day had at his disposal 41 divisions, of which 20 werefresh and 21 were roulement divisions. If the German higher command still wished to keep Prince Rupprecht&apos;s army intact, theyhad still 8 fresh and 22 roidement divisions upon which the crown prince could draw.Seaplane Engage- 2. With reference to War Cabinet 426, Minute- 2, in which itment. had been stated that, in an air engagement with ten hostile machines,two of our own machines were missing, the First Sea Lord informed[1365-427] B
the War Cabinet that both pilots of our two machines had arrived in Holland, one of them without his machine. He assumed thatthis latter would be treated as a shipwrecked mariner, and that theother would be interned.Air Attack on 3. The First Sea Lord reported that there had been a very-Dunkirk, heavy attack on Dunkirk by hostile aircraft the previous night.   no details were as yet to hand, but it was reported that very considerable damage had been done. He gathered, however, that one of ourblock-ships had been sunk in the dock, and he had issued instruc-tions that two other block-ships, which were under orders to go toDunkirk, should not proceed there for the present.In reply to a question as to whether it was true that a con-siderable amount of naval and military stores had recently been removed by us from Dunkirk, the First Sea Lord stated that he hadno information on the subject, but undertook to make enquiries andreport to the War Cabinet in due course.The Naval said 4. With reference to War Cabinet 413, Minute 8, the First sea on Ostend. Lord stated that, according to the latest information, it appeared that the naval operations against Ostend had been attended with alarger measure of success than had first been reported. He had heard that the Germans were apparently evacuating their repairstaff at that port. It was quite possible that the entrance to theport was rapidly silting up. Larger craft for the present were unable to get through, and it seemed as if we had made a miscalcu-lation as to the depth of the channel.Exchange of 5. With&apos; reference to AVar Cabinet 426, Minute 4, attention wasPrisoners of War: drawn to the draft decision of the War Cabinet in regard toInstructions to prisoners of war, according to which &quot; An agreement should not beDelegation. discussed for the exchange of German submarine prisoners.&quot;   Itwas suggested that this draft went beyond the intentions of the WarCabinet, and would unduly tie the hands of our delegates.The War Cabinet decided that         &quot;(a.) This decision should be amended to read as follows :  &quot; (b.) The British delegates are not to raise thequestion of submarine prisoners, and no preliminaryagreement for the exchange of submarine prisonersshould be entered into without special reference tothe AVar Cabinet. An agreement should not be madefor the transport of German prisoners from overseaswithout consultation with the Admiralty representa-tive, and that, if necessary, this question of thetransport of German prisoners should be referredhome for further instructions.&quot;(6.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should transmitthis decision to Sir George Cave, and should explain tohim that the policy of the War Cabinet is to avoidentering into any agreement which would enable theGermans to claim submarine prisoners.Statements in 6. Lord Curzon, speaking as the Leader of the House of Lords,- Parliament.       .    said that a reply, which had been made to a question, by the Parlia-mentary Under-Secretary of State for War, the previous afternoon, onthe subject of the exchange of prisoners, had unfortunately arousedv considerable feeling in that Chamber.   The country as a whole was,
Possible Peace  \-i 7. Attention was drawn to telegram No. 2047, from Sir WalterOvertures. Townley, stating that it was possible that attempts might be madeto sound Sir George Cave tentatively with regard to possible termsof peace.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, in a recentspeech in the House of Commons, he had laid it down that if theenemy had anything to say on the subject of peace we were ready to listen.The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that, during his recent visit to France, he had been told that a great deal of harmhad been done in that country by the idea which obtained thatM. Clemenceau intended to reject every peace overture. Theworking-classes there had the impression that the Government were determined not to make peace. This was unfortunate, as those sameclasses were quite prepared to light on so long as they felt that, if a really favourable approach were made for an honourable peace, theGovernment would be prepared to take it into serious consideration.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should instruct sir george Cave on their behalf in the following sense : &quot; The War Cabinet have had under considerationSir Walter Townley&apos;s telegram regarding possible peaceovertures. In meeting such overtures the attitude you should adopt should be as follows : that you will naturallylisten to anything that may be volunteered to you on thesubject, but that you have no instructions, and that what-ever may be said to you you will report to us.&quot;Russia: 8. With reference to War Cabinet 421, Minute 7, in regard to allied Intervention any proposed Allied intervention in Russia, the Secretary of state in Siberia. for Foreign Affairs pointed out that this question was never properlydiscussed at the meeting of the Supreme War Council recently heldat Versailles, and that the decision of the War Cabinet on the30th May had not been carried into effect.In this connection the Prime Minister explained that he hadreceived very definite and precise information as to PresidentWilson&apos;s opposition to intervention in Siberia, and therefore it wasdecided that it was impossible to discuss the question fully in theSupreme War Council, but that the three Foreign Ministers whowere present at Versailles should consider it. Mr. Lloyd Georgesaid that he had intended to ask General Foch to write a memo-randum on the subject, but unfortunately General Foch was calledaway on the morning when the matter came up for discussion.The Secretary of State for War, however, was asking General Fochfor this memorandum.Mr. Balfour quoted from a private telegram which had beenreceived from Sir William Wiseman by Sir Eric Drummond, and pointed out that President Wilson&apos;s views, as given in this telegram,were not so emphatic against intervention in Siberia as those whichhad been expressed to Mr. Lloyd George. In this telegram it was stated that President Wilson had agreed as to the necessity for there-creation of the Russian front, and that assistance should be givennaturally, deeply interested in the question, which required the mostdelicate and sympathetic handling.Alter some discussion, the War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State For War should be asked to make astatement in Parliament, at the earliest convenient date,reviewing the situation and explaining the policy of theGovernment.
to the Russian people, but, at the same time he had said that no military authority had been able to convince him that any schemewas likely to succeed. President Wilson bad proposed that aCommission, composed of Allied representatives, should be sent toRussia, both to Vladivostock and to Murmansk, for the purpose of organising supplies, and bad said that, if the Allies were invited to intervene in Russia by any recognised body there, he was of opinionthat it ought to be done.Lord Robert Cecil expressed the opinion very strongly that itwas most unfortunate that the Supreme War Council had not beenasked to deal with this question, principally in view of the fact thatit was essential, in his opinion, that a strong recommendation infavour of intervention, passed by the Supreme War Council, shouldhe received by President Wilson.The Prime Minister pointed out that the Supreme War council had had the matter under consideration, and referred to theagreement reached by the Foreign Ministers of France, Great Britain,and Italy, of which the Supreme War Council had taken note(War Cabinet 42(5. Minute 5 (iv.kLord Robert Cecil pointed out that the Supreme War council had only taken note of an agreement between the three foreign ministers, and had not expressed any military opinion, nor had theCouncil recommended any approach to President Wilson until the assent of the Japanese to the proposal has been received. Lie saidthat he considered the manner in which this whole question hadbeen dealt with was most &quot;unsatisfactory.The Prime Minister explained the difficulties with whichPresident Wilson was faced, and pointed out that the main oppositionto any intervention in Siberia by the Japanese came from theWestern Coast of America, where President Wilson had strong political interests. It was firmly believed by those in America whoopposed Japanese intervention that, if once the Japanese sent forcesinto Russia, Siberia would become very largely, at any rate from aneconomic point of view, a Japanese province.Lord Robert Cecil said that he saw no prospect of a successful conclusion to the war unless something were done in this matter.In&apos; the course of the next year it was certain that the Germans wouldbe able, unless something were done, to get the Russians not only towork for them but perhaps to fight for them, thus adding A^eryseriously to the sources of man-power in Germany and to the sources of supply to that country. With regard to the suggestion of opera-ting from Archangel or Murmansk, Lord Robert Cecil said that he did not consider any force operating from those areas would produce a serious effect unless it was backed up by a large expedition fromVladivostock. He did not think that the War Cabinet had ever been quite certain of what it really wanted ; that it had never beensure that intervention was right ; and that, consequently, this feeling of uncertainty had also been felt by our agents abroad. In hisopinion,, opportunities had been lost in the past, for though at firstPresident Wilson was not unfavourable, later, political interestsbegan to operate. Since then we have been told that there hasbeen a great change in public feeling in America, and he consideredthat, if strong pressure of a military character supported by adecision from the Supreme War Council, could be brought to thenotice of President Wilson, President Wilson might agree, althoughperhaps reluctantly.The First Lord of the Admiralty agreed that it was difficult toobtain a considered view of the War Cabinet on this question, but said that, in his opinion, in view of the grave difficulties oftransport and communication which must result from an expeditionfrom Vladivostock, the efficacy of an effort from Murmansk shouldbe compared to the efficacy of an effort even with Japanese helpwest of Cheliabinsk. Sir Eric Geddes was strongly of opinionthat to develop a railway from Vladivostock, capable of carrying
stores and supplies, under modern conditions, was too colossal anundertaking for the Japanese to consider. Hs had never seen a considered and exhaustive study or report on the two possibleefforts, and he thought the indefinite policy which Lord robert cecil complained of, and of which he was also very conscious, was due to the absence of such a report.The Prime Minister agreed that the resuscitation of the Trans-Siberian Railway could not possibly be done without the whole-hearted co-operation of America, and pointed out the difficulties oftransport which already existed in Siberia. Mr. Lloyd George also said that it was necessary to take into consideration the demandwhich had been made by M. Clemenceau that priority of claim to japanese shipping should be given to the transport of Czecho-Slovak troops from Vladivostock to Prance.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that no con-sidered statement had been made by the Military Authorities as tothe possibilities of intervention, or as to the strength of force whichwould be required. On this point he had sent a telegram some time ago to Lord Reading, giving the reasons why the British government considered intervention necessary, and saying that this telegramwould be followed by a detailed military argument. The telegram had been sent over to the War Office, but the AVar Office had declined to write any memorandum on the subject, giving as a reason that this question was not entirely a military one. Mr. Balfouragreed that the principal factor to be taken into consideration wasthe reception which any force would receive from the inhabitants ofthe country.Sir Eric Geddes said that he thought the possibility of in 1vention should be considered by the Military Authorities from three points of view : -(a.) AArith the inhabitants of Siberia friendly,(o.) Actively friendly, or(c.) Inert.Before this question could be property reasoned out there must be some considered opinion as to the force which would be necessary toproduce useful results, and it was essential that the prospect of suchresults should be put before President AATlsou. Sir Eric Geddeswas of opinion-that it should be considered on the most favourablefooting of passive inertia from the local inhabitants, and also that adecision should be come to as to what force could be maintained atChelyabinsk, or beyond. He was still of opinion, however, that amuch smaller effort via Murmansk would give better results indiverting German forces from the Western front, but, in the absenceof the exhaustive study of the possibilities of intervention in Siberiaand Murmansk, he did not see how the Cabinet or President Wilsoncould adopt the definite policy which Lord Robert Cecil asked for.Mr. Balfour pointed . out that the objections to any operations from Murmansk were tonnage and men, and that the merit of intervention via Vladivostock was that 500,000 first-class fightingtroops could be utilised, while operations from Murmansk would entail taking away troops already fighting in other theatres of war.The Prime Minister suggested that, in view of the possibility ofLord Reading&apos;s return from America for a visit to this country,Lord Robert Cecil should himself go to America in order to lay his views on this question personally before President Wilson, and hesaid that the AArar Cabinet would equip Lord Robert Cecil with allthe necessary military arguments, and also obtain the views ofGeneral Foch on the question.Considerable discussions ensued, in which it was pointed outthat it was most desirable to prevent the Germans withdrawingsupplies from Russia, even if it were not possible to develop a campaign against the German army.[1365-427] &apos; C
It was also agreed that, if a considerable Allied force could be concentrated at Valogda, there would be a considerable rally to theAllied forces there.The War Cabinet decided that &apos;i be Chief of the Imperial General Staff should prepare a memo randam showing&apos; (a.) A detailed military argument with regard to allied intervention in Siberia.(6.) The size of the Allied army which could be main-tained as far westward as Cheliabinsk.(c.) Whether it would be possible to maintain an army at the latter place of sufficient strength to preventsupplies   being   withdrawn   from   Russia   toGermany.id.) The necessary force of Allied troops which would berequisite to carry out active operations from-Murmansk or Archangel, either with or withoutintervention through Siberia.(e.) With regard to-the above-proposed operations, thedifference in the number of men and the amountof material and supplies which would be necessaryii the local inhabitants were (i.) Friendly.iii.) Indifferent,(iii.) Hostile.(iv.) Partly hostile and partly friendly.Holland: 9. With reference to War Cabinet 425, Minute 16, the WarDespatch of Convoy Cabinet had under consideration a report by the Northern Neutralsto Dutch East Committee as to the action to be taken with regard to the decision^ndies- of the Dutch Government to send a convoy from Holland to theDutch East Indies.The First Sea Lord urged that, if the recommendations of theCommittee were accepted, we should publish a communique on thesubject, setting out our contentions in this matter, and pointing outthat it was imperative in the interests of the AUies that we should maintain our right of search.General Smuts stated that such was the intention of theCommittee, but that it was not possible to issue any communiqueon the subject until we had answered the note of the Dutch Govern-ment, received their reply, and definitely settled our policy if theywere not prepared to accept our suggested compromise.The Minister of Blockade took exception to the last few linesof the Report of the Committee, which advocated that, if the Dutchrefused to meet us in this matter, the War Cabinet, before issuingan order for the seizure of the Dutch merchant ships, should care-fully reconsider the case in all its bearings. Lord Robert Cecilexpressed the view that our policy should be definitely settled now,and pointed out that, failing agreement with the Dutch, it was essential if the blockade were to be efficiently maintained that we, should exercise our right of search. He realised, however, that thatmeant a remote possibility of war with Holland.General Smuts stated that he was unable to accept the contentions-tion of the Minister of Blockade, that the question should not bere considered if the Dutch, refused to accept the compromise recom-mended by his Committee, and he could not take part in a courseof action that might lead to war with Holland. Before such a stepwas taken he thought General Botha should be consulted, as itmight have grave results in South Africa.   His view was that we
must safeguard our own position as far as possible, but that,before insisting on our right of search to the extent of taking actionin the matter, we ought to consult our Allies. In this connection he pointed out that only the Germans and ourselves insisted on theright of search when merchant ships were under convoy of theirown men-of-war, and, further, chat at the Naval Conference in1909-10 both the British and German Governments had expressed their readiness to adopt the view of the other Powers, with certainsafeguards. Consequently, if we insisted on exercising the rightof search, we might find ourselves in a false position with regard toour Allies.The Pirst Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that, although ourpresent Allies may have held contrary views to us on this question before the war, it was probable that their opinion in the matter nowcoincided with ours, and the division of opinion which ^general smuts quoted was really an obsolete one, and not of current adversecharacter.Lord Curzon expressed the view that at the present stage itwas undesirable for the War Cabinet to decide that we would,without reconsideration of any further proposals that might be madeby the Dutch, insist, even to the extent of going to war withHolland, on what we had always contended were our rights withregard to the search of neutral merchant ships.The War Cabinet approved the proposals set out in the Reportof the Northern Neutrals Committee (Paper G.-210).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 6, 1918.
