The WeaternFront:Prisoners of War.Transfer of Ger-man Divisions.1. ATTENTION was called to the statement in the Germancommunique that a large number of prisoners had been capturedon the Western front during the last day or two. It was pointedout that the War Cabinet had received no information on thissubject, and that they were entitled to know the facts, whether the news was good or bad, and also whether the prisoners were british or French.The Secretary of State for War stated that the number of miss-ing which had been reported up to the present date was only36,000. He realised that reports as to the numbers missing mustnecessarily be delayed in order to secure as exact information aspossible.Lord Derby undertook that the War Office should communi-cate with Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig and with theBritish Liaison Officers with the French Army on thissubject.2. In connection with the above discussion, attention was drawn to the incompleteness of the information which was receivedby the War Cabinet from official sources, as compared with the relatively full information given in the German communiques andby the press. The fault appeared to lie rather with the higher command in France than with the War Office. It was pointedout that this lack of information greatly increased the difficultieswhich Ministers experienced in dealing with questions of thisdescription in Parliament.3. With reference to War Cabinet 367, Minute 3, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff reported that two more German divi-sions had been moved to the Western front from Russia, making atotal of 196 divisions present on this front. . General Wilson also stated that four or five Landwehr divisions had been identified onthe Western front.The Italian Front:Italian Go-operation on the WesternFron fc.4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff indicated certainredistributions of Allied troops between the Western and Italianfronts which were under consideration.The Prime Minister stated that the Italian Ambassador had visited him in order to urge that Italian divisions should take partin the present battle.The War Cabinet decided that The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should telegraph toGeneral Foch in the sense that it would be advisable, if he approved, that some Italian divisions should co-operate with the Allied forces during the present fighting on theWestern front.Macedonia. 5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that fourJager battalions had been moved from Macedonia and had been located in Alsace, and that one German infantry regiment had moved from Macedonia to Palestine and had been identified atAmman. General Wilspn pointed out that this movement wouldresult in leaving only eight German battalions in Macedonia.With reference to the moral of the Greek troops in Macedonia,General Wilson said that he had received a good report of theGreek divisions, and had asked General Milne to furnish him witha further report on this question.
H.M.S. &quot; Edgar.&quot; 7. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that he had receiveda report to the effect that H.M.S. &quot; Edgar &quot; was torpedoed whenforty miles off Malta. He said that this cruiser was fitted with a&quot; blister,&quot; which Avas perforated and the hull damaged, but thatthe ship proceeded to Malta under her own steam, and had arrivedthere safely.8. With reference to War Cabinet 383, Minute 16, the WarCabinet had under consideration a Revised Draft of the Bill tomake further provision with respect to military service during thepresent war.The Home Secretary explained that the Bill, as now drafted,gave power to remodel existing tribunals without disturbing thewhole system of tribunals as it existed to-day. All the machineryof the tribunals would still remain, but, with the power of nomina-tion given under the Bill, the constitution of tribunals could be soadapted as to establish similar tribunals both for Great Britainand Ireland.9. Questioned as to the number of men it was proposed toraise under the Bill, the Minister of National Service said that hehad been in consultation Avith the Adjutant-General, and that300,000 men were required by the end of June, not inclusive of therequirements of the Navy and the Royal Air Force.It was pointed out that it was very desirable that the Govern-ment should be in a position to state to Parliament how manyextra men, above the 420,000 already agreed upon for this year,would be enlisted under the provisions of the Bill.Sir Auckland Geddes said that the answer to this question must necessarily depend on the authorisation which he receivedfrom the War Cabinet.The Age-Limit. 10. With reference to War Cabinet 383, Minute 9, a further discussion arose on the question of the age-limit being raised tofifty-five, and it was stated that there would be considerable oppo-sition to this proposal in the House of Commons, and that it was amatter for consideration if it were not proposed at present tocall up men of the ages of from fifty to fifty-five, with the excep-tion of members of the medical profession whether sufficientmilitary value would be gained to justify this proposal.The Prime Minister said that he would consult his colleagues on the question, but pointed out that the main object of this bill was to get in readiness an army for next year, and that it was mose essential, in view of the certainty that the Germans would, duringthe autumn, use all their reserves available, that we should main-tain our reserves at full strength.The War Cabinet agreed to the Revised Draft of the Bill.Amendment of theMilitary service acts:The Constitutionof Tribunals inGreat Britainand Ireland,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,April 6, 1918.Submarines. 6. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that the periscope ofa submarine was sighted by H.M.S. &quot; Oberon &quot; on the 4th April inthe vicinity of Portland Bill.
