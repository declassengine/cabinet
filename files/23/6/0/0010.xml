The Director of Military Operations stated that the attackmade by the Germans on the previous day had, in the lightof further information, turned out to be more important than had been at first thought, and that they had attacked with probably 8 divisions, and certainly with 5 whichhad actually been identified. The Portuguese put up a fight at thebeginning, and then collapsed, with the result that a dangeroussalient had been created between Armentieres and La Bassee. Itwas certain that a number of guns had been lost, and that bothPortuguese and British prisoners had been taken. At one timethe enemy reached Givenchy, but had been driven out by ourcounter-attack, in which we took 750 prisoners. On the whole, theflanks had held well, and our line of defence was now the RiverLys. -v;*;- 1[1365-t-3S8]
General Maurice continued that another attack had takenplace this morning further north, to the east of Armentieres andMessines, and that the enemy had got into our front system every-where between the Lys and the Douve. Our reserves had been moved up, but an awkward salient existed for Bethune, which wasvery important, and also for Armentieres. The whole of the attackthat started to-day was carried out against the Ilnd Army, under General Plumer, while nearly the whole of yesterday&apos;s attack was against the 1st Army, under General Home. Against the IlndArmy, the Germans had 8 fresh divisions in reserve.At a later stage the War Cabinet were informed by general maurice that the enemy who had obtained a footing on MessinesHill had been driven back. The enemy holds Ploegsteert WTood,but we hold Hill 63, which dominates the wood and Armentieres.The situation is generally better, but we may have to evacuateArmentieres. General Maurice stated that he was of opinion thatwe were approaching another crisis. The Germans were now en-trenching hard between Noyon and Montdidier, and, whilst hold-ing us there, having drawn all our reserves down south, werethrowing into the battle up north all their fresh troops againstours, who were tired and contained a number of young and in-experienced drafts. The weather was very much against us, beingfoggy, which rendered it impossible for us to take full advantageof our &quot;heavy gun and machine-gun defences.General Maurice stated that Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Flaig,General Foch, and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff had had a conference at Montreuil, and that they had reached arrange-ments which the latter considered sufficiently satisfactory. Hewas leaving for Pa,ris to interview M. Clemenceau.The War Cabinet were not satisfied with the statement of theChief of the Imperial General Staff that the arrangements arrivedat at Montreuil were &quot; sufficiently satisfactory,&quot; and it wassuggested that it would be desirable that the Prime minister should telegraph to the President of the Council urging that french reserves should be sent up to assist us, but it was felt that,before any action of this nature was taken, it was advisable to hearfrom General Wilson as to the result of his conference with M.Clemenceau to-day, which the Director of Military7 Operationsundertook to communicate to the Prime Minister.The War Cabinet considered it essential that the french should treat our portion of the line as part of their battle-front.If we were satisfied on this point, the less the&apos; Generals were inter-ferecl with the better.The War Cabinet were further of opinion that it was essentialthat a member of the Cabinet should, during this crisis, be on the spot in France, and they therefore asked Lord Milner to hold himself in readiness to proceed to france at an early date.Transfer of German 2. With reference to War Cabinet 386, Minute 1, the DirectorDivisions. of Military Operations reported that a further German division,brought from Russia, had been identified on the Western front,making 199 in all. The highest estimate of the total number ofGerman divisions that could be concentrated against us on theWestern front was 220, although other estimates put the numberat 205.Comparison ofAllied and enemy forces.3. With reference to War Cabinet 371, Minute 2, in reply to questions, the Director of Military Operations gave some par-ticulars as to the relative strengths of the Allied and enemy armiesat the present time on the Western front.   Reckoned-in divisions,
Troops from 4. The Director of Military  Operations  stated that  theMacedonia. General Staff were considering the advisability of withdrawingtroops from Salonica, and would report to the War Cabinet on thematter later.Casualties.5. With reference to War Cabinet 384, Minute 1, lord derby reported that the estimated number of casualties, based onthe roll-call, was 150,000, but the casualties which were definitelyknown to have been incurred from the 21st March to the 6th Aprilwere as follows: Officers.   Other ranks.Killed ...       ......   1,010        9,307Wounded      .........   3,658      46,407Missing (including prisoners)   2,524      49,4607,192     105,174In connection with the wounded he wished to instance the remarkable returns from one hospital which had dealt with 5,000cases, in which there had been only 8 deaths, 4 of which were fromgas gangrene, and not one from tetanus.   He added that thewrounded were being evacuated to possible.Englandas rapidly as  wasIreland:compulsory military Service.6. The Prime Minister read a telegram (Paper G.T.-41S9)received from Mr. Duke, which indicated that de Valera was urg-ing the Sinn Fein County Executive that it would be better fortheir policy if conscription came, when they could undertakesystematic and violent opposition to its enforcement. He wasadvocating a policy of the stoppage of all transport work, and theshooting of the recruiting authorities, whether belonging to theArmy or to the Royal Irish Constabulary.the enemy had 199 divisions compared with our 167. assuming the enemy casualties to be about 200,000, they would now have1,370,000 infantry. The 6 or 7 divisions which had been broughtacross from Russia since the beginning of the battle might beregarded as compensating for their casualties.On the Allied side, the French had brought in 2 divisions, andwe had brought in 1, but 5 of ours, and the Portuguese division,had been knocked out, which reduced the Allied rifle strength to1.4 50,000.The Director of Military Operations was of opinion that theenemy, in anticipation of this offensive, had prepared drafts toreplace all casualties. They had 400,000 drafts available beforethe offensive started. In addition, it was possible for them todraw on their divisions in the East to the extent of 100,000 drafts.Moreover, the Germans had taken all their troops that were serv-ing in Macedonia and in Italy, which proved conclusively that theywere concentrating every ounce of strength on the present battle.Against this, the French had 250,000 in depots, and we had200,000. including the men returning from leave. We had sent toFrance, since the 21st March, 1918, 110,000 infantry and 20,000to 30,000 others,,over and above the men returning from leave.It was mentioned that, as regards the thinning of the divisions on the Russian front, this might be counter-balanced by100.000 United States troops due to arrive shortly in France.
It was pointed out that it would be desirable to make itclear to the dock labourers that if they went on strike their exemp-tions would be automatically cancelled, and that they would be absorbed into the Army.The Secretary was directed to send a copy of the telegram tothe Field-Marshal Commanding Home Defence, for com-munication to the military authorities in Ireland for suchaction as might be necessary.Mr. Barnes and Lord Derby undertook to make enquiries asregards the situation at the various docks.Publication of 7. The War Cabinet had under consideration an AdmiraltyShipping Losses.       memorandum as to the form in which the losses and output of mer-chant tonnage should in future be published, and approved theproposals as set out in Paper G.T.-4174.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,April 10, 1918.
