THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff showed the WarCabinet a sketch of a German tank, with technical descriptions.He said that recent experience had shown that German tanks ranaway from our big tanks, but ran after our little ones. The chiefdefect of the German tanks appeared to be that they were unableto cross a ditch more than 8 feet 6 inches in width.Technical Devices;Illustrations inNewspapers.2. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to the largenumber of illustrations of British technical devices appearing in theillustrated press.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary should enquire, on behalf of the War Cabinet,as to the organisation for censoring illustrated papers, andto report to the War Cabinet.
The Belgian Front. 3. With reference to War Cabinet 409, Minute 2, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff reported that General Foch was satisfied with regard to the position in front of the Belgian army. Theground was marshy, and inundations had been extended. some anxiety had been felt as to the point of junction between the Britishand Belgian armies, but as to this also General Foch was reported as being satisfied.The Western Front.Co-operation of theUnited States ofAmerica.4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that therewas no change in the general situation. In accordance with arrangements concluded with General Foch for facilitating theprovision of French reserves, the IXth Corps had begun to takeover the command of the sectors astride the Aisne River atBerry-au-Bac.5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that oneUnited States brigade was now in the line, south of Mohtdidier,under French command.Gas, Attack by-British.Weekly- Reports bythe Director ofMilitaryOperations.6. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that a gasattack had been made by the British on a large scale, but withoutinfantry attack, between the Hohenzollern Redoubt and La Bassee,under favourable conditions of wind. 3,000 cylinders of gas hadbeen released.7. The Prime Minister asked the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff what were the present arrangements for the communication ofinformation to the press in the United States. He called attentionto one of General Maurice&apos;s interviews, in which references to theFrench had been made, which were likely to be resented bv our allies.The Secretary of State for War undertook to caution the officercharged with this duty, to be on his guard against sayinganything that would give umbrage to our Allies.In this connection the Chief of the Imperial General staff pointed out that the French newspapers&apos; had dealt rather hardly withour army, and that Lord Milner had felt obliged to write on thesubject to M. Clemenceau, who had replied with a friendly letter.General Wilson stated that the tone of the French press had nowimproved.Lack of Leadership S. Attention was called to accounts, which had reached members in Retreat. of the War Cabinet from private sources, in regard to -(a.) The alleged lack of control and direction of our troops inthe recent retreats in the Vth and 1st Armies&apos; areas,which was stated to have resulted in the abandonment of prepared positions owing to lack of some person inauthority to indicate them to the retiring troops.(&amp;.): The alleged failure of our military engineers to effectdemolitions of roads, bridges, culverts, &amp;c, in the retreat,and generally the alleged inadequate management oflabour in entrenchment and other military engineering.It was suggested that, notwithstanding the excellentfighting qualities of our troops, which were superior tothose of the enemy, our armies had sustained severe set-backs.In this connection the Secretary drew attention to an under-taking given by the Prime Minister, at a Conference at Abbeville on
Submarines. 9. With reference to War Cabinet 409, Minute 3, the deputy first Sea Lord stated that a message had been received from theGommander-in-Oliief, Grand Fleet, to the effect that the bombing ofone of our submarines by an airship, reported on the 11th instant,appeared to have been carried out against the wreck of the &quot; K. 17,&quot;Avhich had been sunk on the 31st January last by collision (WarCabinet 330, Minute o)-.The Deputy First Sea Lord reported the sinking of two enemy submarines : ---(a.) The steamship &quot;Olympic,&apos;&apos; bringing 6,000 troops from america to this country, had sighted a submarine ahead.The officer of the- watch had put the helm over,and had succeeded in cutting the submarine in two.Four officers and twenty-seven men had been rescuedfrom the submarine. The submarine in question wasthe &quot; D. 103.&quot;(b.) H.M.S. &quot;Loyal&quot; had arrived at Devonport with threeprisoners from &quot; U.B. 72,&quot; which had been sunk by thesubmarine &quot; D. 4&quot; on the 12th instant, 25 miles S.S.W.from Portland Bill.Seaplane Attack onSubmarine Base atCattaro.Russia:The Baltic Fleet.10. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that seven Italiau sea-plaues-had- carried out a successful attack on the submarine base atCattaro on the 12th instant. All the machines had returned safely.Propaganda pamphlets had been dropped. On the 11th May sixBritish machines had carried out a bombing attack on Cattaro.Two direct hits were observed on the floatiug dock and arsenal.The attack on submarines and destroyers was also apparently good.One enemy machine was driven down into the sea. One Britishmachine had been obliged to land 8 miles from Teodo.11. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that our naval attache at Petrograd stated that the Russian Naval General staff had received a telegram from Moscow saying that the Commissaryof Naval and Military Affairs, in discussing the steps to be takenregarding the Baltic Fleet, had agreed that all arrangements shouldbe made. The telegram terminated by saying that similar incidentsto those connected with the Black Sea Fleet must not be repeated.In a subsequent telegram the Naval Attache at Petrograd reported the 3rd May, 191.8, in reply to a request by General Foch, to enquire into the possibility of obtaining more labour.The Secretary of State for War said that all the above matters were under consideration, including the organisation of existinglabour at the front, which was, perhaps, more important than theimportation of fresh labour.The Ghief of the Imperial General Staff said that in the more recent operations, as in the earlier stages of the war, the French hadintervened to prevent important demolitions from being effected ;they had even gone so far as to take out the charges which we had put into bridges. This, no doubt, Would be dealt with in the reportthat Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Plaig was furnishing.The Secreiary of State for War deprecated a proposal for afurther enquiry to be ordered by the War Cabinet. The Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff had already done much to remedy defects,and he would prefer to send someone to examine on the spot the preparations which we were making. The matter depended,however, mainly on the quality and experience of the officerscommanding the various units, and every effort was being made toimprove this situation.
that he placed no confidence in this order, and that he was proceeding with the arrangements that had already been proposed by him.He added that everything pointed to German occupation inside thenext two weeks, but that the present very acute position of thesupply question in Petrograd might retard the operation. german prisoners in Petrograd had all had new uniforms served out.Murmansk.12. The Deputy First Sea Lord said that the Rear-Admiral at murmansk reported that a French. Colonel Dpnop had arrived therefrom Moscow, with orders to go to Archangel to superintend the arrival there of Czechs and Serbians.Russia.13. With reference to War Cabinet 109 a, the War Cabinetnoted and approved General Smuts&apos; Report (Paper G.T.-4519)(Appendix).In connection with the decision that General Poole should proceed to Russia to take charge of British military interests there,a discussion arose as to the impending appointment of a diplomatistto co-ordinate the activities of various British missions and consu-lates scattered through the country.It was agreed between the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the Secretary of State for War that General Pooleshould have the right of direct communication with theWar Office, but that he should be under the generalauthority of the co-ordinating diplomatic official. Pendingthe appointment of an officer for this purpose, GeneralPoole should be in communication with Mr. Lockhart, andshould be careful not to intervene in diplomatic affairswithout previously consulting him.The names and qualifications of various distinguished personswho might be eligible for the diplomatic post in question were discussed.It was generally agreed that, for the moment, military questions were of greater urgency than any other in Russia, but that ultimatelycommercial considerations would be of great importance, and onthis subject Mr. Balfour said he had arranged to see Sir ArthurSteel-Maitland.The question of the actual appointment to the function ofco-ordinating our diplomatic action in Russia was left in,abeyance for the time being-ft*yveU*wj,.3-.&apos; 6AmericanReinforcements.14. The Prime Minister drew attention to Lord Readingstelegram No. 2118, dated the 11th May, 1918, and other recent telegrams, on the subject of American reinforcements. He pro-posed to communicate the gist of this telegram to M. Clemenceau,and to suggest that the next meeting of the Supreme War council should be in the first week in June, when a final decision on thissubject could be reached.The Secretary of State for War stated that 09,000 american troops had arrived or were on their way to join the British forces onthe Western front.After some discussion of the difficulties connected with thissubject, the War Cabinet, agreed that The Prime Minister should send to M. Clemenceau for his personal information and for communication to general foch only, a summary of Lord Reading&apos;s latest telegrams,accompanied   by a suggestion that   the   Supreme War
WC 410Council should meet as early as possible in June, and thatM. Clemenceau, if he agreed, should communicate thesuggestion to Signor Orlando.Pay andSeparationAllowances of italian Soldiers.MilnersForeignnote by15. With reference to War Cabinet 361, Minute 7, the WarCabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor War, dealing with the desirability of counteracting pacifistpropaganda in Italy by doing something to improve the miserablyinadequate pay and separation allowances of the Italian army.Lord Milner said that the matter had been before the Cabineton more than one previous occasion, and if anything was to be done it should be done at once, before the strain of a big enemy offensivecomes on the Italians. The project had been strongly supported bySignor Bissolati, who believed that the announcement of a generousoffer of assistance by the British Government would have an excellent . moral effect on the Italian army, as well as on the peopleof Italy generally. The money involved was about 1,000,000/. per month.The Secretary corrected the statement in Lordmemorandum with reference to a discussion between theSecretary and Baron Sonnino, and drew attention to aMr. Balfour (Paper G.T.-3930), according to which Signor Orlandowas more or less satisfied with the position, and did not think itnecessary for anything further to be done.Sir Robert Chalmers said that the proposal was without prece-dent in dealing with a sovereign Power, and it was inopportune,inasmuch as the Chancellor of the Exchequer was at the presentmoment endeavouring to transfer to the United States the provisionof credit for the purchases of the Italian Government in neutral countries. The Italians were in frequent need of financial help, andthis offer of a free gift would make it much more difficult for theTreasury to resist or reduce their demands in future. He admitted that these objections would be much weakened if the AmericanGovernment joined with His Majesty&apos;s Government in making theoffer to Italy.The War Cabinet recognised that the main consideration bywhich they should be guided was the importance of raising thefighting quality of the Italian troops. Any offer of assistance wouldhave to be made in the most delicate way, and the situation wouldbe rendered much easier if the co-operation of the American Govern-ment could be secured.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should send a telegram to Lord Reading inviting the American Government to joinHis Majesty&apos;s Government in making a formal offer ofassistance to the Italian Government on the lines suggestedin Lord milner&apos;s memorandum.16. Mr. Barnes informed the Cabinet that a serious position had arisen in connection with the building trades of Liverpool. Therate current in that district prior to the war was IQ^d. or lid.,which has now been forced up to Is. 2d. per hour. The men were now claiming a further increase to Is. Cri. per hour, in addition to*the 124 per cent. A meeting of the Liverpool Building TradesConciliation Board had recently taken place, at which, owing to thefact that two of the employers had voted on the side of the men, therate of Is. 6d. had now been established, and had been conceded bythe employers. Mr. Barnes said that a further conference betweeuthe Government officials concerned and the Liverpool Building-Trades Conciliation Board would take place on Wednesday next.Mr. Barnes stated that he understood that the Ministry of LabourWages in theBuilding Trades.
had consulted with representatives of all the Departments concerned,and it was proposed to appoint a Committee with a view to ensuring that no future general increase of wages in the building tradesshould be granted without the consent of that Committee.The War Cabinet took note of the above action.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 13, 19 IS.
APPENDIX.G.T.-4519.--Intervention in Russia.(Note by General Smuts with reference to War Cabinet 409 a.)THE War Cabinet this morning appointed Lord Milner and myself, together withthe First Sea Lord and. the C.I.G.S., as a Committee to consider the question of the steps which could immediately be taken to organise military resistance to the enemy inRussia while the correspondence with America and Japan in reference to intervention was proceeding.   We met this afternoon and arrived at the following conclusions : &apos;1. A great deal of confusion and cross-correspondence was at present arising fromthe absence of any definition and apportionment of military responsibility in Russiaamong the Allies. It seemed to us, therefore, advisable to divide the responsibility forcertain localities among the Allies as hereunder stated. It seemed also anomalous that,while great efforts were being made to secure the intervention of Japan, in Russia, the^Czecho-Slovak troops should be removed from that country to the Western front. TheShipping Controller reported that any transport of Czecho-Slovak troops would simplydivert tonnage from the transport of equivalent numbers of American troops, and itappeared inadvisable to ask for Japanese tonnage for the purpose at the very timewhen we were pressing Japan to undertake intervention in Russia, which would absorball her tonnage. We therefore came to the conclusion tha the Czecho-Slovak troops now at Vladivostock or on their way to it should be taken charge of there and be organised into efficient units by the French Government, to whom the above difficultiesin the way of their transport to France should be pointed out, and who should beasked that, pending their eventual transport to France, they might be used to stiffenthe Japanese as part of an Allied force of intervention in Russia. Similarly the restof the Czecho-Slovak force in Russia should be collected at Murmansk and Archangel,preferably the latter, and should be taken charge of there and organised hj the BritishGovernment, and pending their transport across the sea should be used to hold thoseplaces and to take part in any Allied intervention in Russia. The Secretary of Statefor War undertook to send a telegram in the above sense to M. Clemenceau, who had addressed a question to him about the transport of the Czecho-Slovaks from Vladivostockin execution of the Supreme War Council resolution on the subject. It was felt thatthe collection and organisation of large bodies of troops at the above ports would initself be a warning to Germany against the removal of further divisions to theWestern front.2. It was decided that General Poole should proceed as soon as possible to russians our military representative in order to take charge of military affairs so far as theBritish Government was concerned, and to advise the War Office as to all steps to betaken in regard to our intervention in Russia. Meantime his London Office wouldcollect the necessary officers and N.C.O.&apos;s, more or less on the lines of the Dunstervillemission, to assist him in the task of organising the Czecho-Slovaks and other forces of intervention from Archangel and Murmansk. The First Sea Lord undertook to sendsome 200 marines for the defence of Archangel, and the War office to send suchmunitions and, supplies as General Poole might deem necessary for the purpose of his mission. General Poole was to consider, while holding and safeguarding the positions at Murmansk and Archangel, how far he could work up from Archangel towardsVologeda with the forces at his disposal.o. It was not considered advisable at the present juncture to move either Americanor other Allied troops from the West to Russia, though the matter should bere considered at a later stage of the present enemy offensive on the Western front.4. After the discussion this morning at the War Cabinet, at which the PrimeMinister pointed, out how difficult and indeed impossible it was for M. Trotsky to inviteAllied intervention in Russia, however much he might desire it, before an Allied force was on the spot to protect him against the enemy, it was felt by the Committee that an undue weight had been placed, in our recent correspondence, on the desirability of an invitation for intervention from the Bolshevik Government. It was therefore decidedto recommend to the Foreign Office that the difficulties against such an invitationshould be pointed out to the American and Japanese Governments, and that theyshould be pressed to be satisfied with the very strong expressions which had alreadyfallen from M. Trotsky and the Bolshevik Foreign Minister without waiting for a formalinvitation which the Bolshevik Government could not be expected to make in theirpresent helpless situation.(Signed) J. C. SMUTS.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 11, 1918.WC 410
