Lord Robert Cecil informed the War Cabinet that theFrench Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was due to arrive inLondon that evening. The principal object of his visit was probably to discuss the policy to be pursued in regard to Russia.The War Cabinet decided that M. Pkhon should be invited to confer with the Prime Minister,Mr. Balfour, and Lord Robert Cecil at 11a.m. the following day, in the Cabinet Room, prior to a meeting of the WarCabinet at noon.Lord Robert Cecil undertook to invite M. Pichon&apos;s attendance.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff was instructed toarrange to attend, in case his presence be required.South Persia.- Lord Robert Cecil stated that affairs in South Persia were ina rather disturbed state. Recent restlessness in that quarter hadculminated in the preaching of a jehad by Soulet, the leader of theKashgai   tribe   (Sir   C.

A further report stated that the armed yacht &quot; Lorna &quot; had sunk an enemy submarine M-J- miles from Portland Bill,on the same day, capturing one survivor.As regards the reports under (c) and (i^), the Deputy First sea lord stated that verification was necessary as to whether one or twosubmarines had been sunk.
Russia:The Czecho-SlovakCouncil.7. The War Cabinet had under consideration a note by lord robert Cecil on the subject of the Czecho-Slovak National Council,and a draft letter addressed to Dr. Benes, the London representativeof the Czecho-Slovak Council (Paper G.T.-4647).Lord Robert Cecil pointed out that a request&apos; had been putforward by the Czecho-Slovak National Council to the effect that theBritish Government should accord it the same recognition as hadbeen given to it by the French and Italian Governments. Lord robert cecil said that he proposed to address a letter, as drafted, to theLondon representative of the Czecho-Slovak Council, which, whilegiving them the measure of recognition desired, would not commit the Government to any increased war obligations.The War Cabinet approved the draft letter to the Londonrepresentative of the Czecho-Slovak Council.Replacement ofVessels Lost by war Risks.american reinforcements.8. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister ol Shipping, with reference to the proposal to replacevessels lost bv war risks, by giving the owner a standard ship(Paper G.T.-4610).As there was no dispute on the subject of this proposal, theWar Cabinet requested The Chancellor of the Exchequer to confer with the Minister ofShipping with reference to the answer to be sent to theowners who had made the application.&quot;1365-9. With reference to War Cabinet 412, Minute 13, the PrimeMinister referred to the recent telegrams which had been received on the subject of American reinforcements from Lord Reading(Nos. 2329, 2350, and other telegrams which had been receivedfrom the War Office from the British Mission at Washington).Mr. Lloyd George said that, while these telegrams were fairly clearas to the number of troops which were being sent, it was verydifficult to ascertain from them what actual numbers of american reinforcements were available in France at the present time, or what the position, as regards these reinforcements, would be for thenext two months.The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that during may 160,000 American troops would reach France. These,-however,were not all infantry and machine-gunners, as other services hadbeen brought over, including field engineers, signallers, andambulances Of these 160,000, it might be reckoned that 60 percent, to 70 per cent, would be infantry and machine-gunners.-418J B 224th May, 1918), and the siege of Fort Khanet Zinian, held by a detachment of the South Persian Rifles, by a body of Kashgaiestimated at about 2,000 men. The hostile movement appeared tobe spreading. As prompt action was necessary, and time would not admit of the Eastern Committee being consulted, Lord Robert Cecilhad telegraphed on Saturday to Sir C. Marling, giving Sir PercySykes full authority to act as he thought best.Lord Curzon, as Chairman of the Eastern Committee, said thatthe area of the present disturbance was between Shiraz and the sea.Sir Percy Sykes had under him the South Persian Rifles, whoconstituted a scattered unreliable force of about 5,000 men, in regardto whose loyalty we had lately received somewhat ominous reports,and, in addition, approximately 1,200 Indian troops near Shiraz.Lord Curzon considered that Lord Robert Cecil had no alternativehut to act as he had clone. The Kastern Committee was to meet thefollowing afternoon, and would discuss the situation and the measuresto he taken to meet it.The War Cabinet decided that The matter should be dealt with bv the Eastern Committee.
General Harington said that, in his opinion, there should be70 American battalions complete by the end of this month, andthat, of the 10 divisions which would reinforce the British Army,the elements of 9 were in France, and the advance party of the10th had arrived ; 113,000 Americans had arrived in France thismonth, and he had just heard of another 40,000 sailing between the18th and 24th May, of which 2(5,000 were infantry and 3,000machine-gunners.The Prime Minister said that it was very important that theCabinet should know how many American infantry there would beavailable for use by the end of May, and to what extent theAmerican troops in France would be available to repair the damage which would be done by the second German offensive of this year,and for a third German offensive when it came.The Chief of the Imperial General. Staff promised to procurethe information desired, but said that he had already asked Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig to send him a return every Saturdaystating how many Americans would be put into line by the followingSaturday. He would therefore have a statement on this subject to lay before the War Cabinet every Monday. Sir Douglas Haighad informed him that there would be, by the 1st June, threeAmerican battalions in the line held by the British troops, and that afurther six were in training behind the line. Sir Douglas Haig was of opinion that, if necessary, these battalions in training could beused i f the German offensive continued for any time, but general foch was not so optimistic, and had expressed the opinion that itwould be better for these battalions to be employed on the southernportion of the line. General Wilson said that he had just receiveda message from Sir Douglas Haig, who, after a conference withGeneral Foch, had now changed his plans, and come to the con-clusion that it was undesirable to pirt the American battalions intocadre divisions, and had decided that they should be trained forthree or four weeks in back areas first. General Wilson said thatthis decision might alter all the arrangements as regards transport,&amp;c, which had been made. General Wilson pointed out that theAmerican rule was that all the Ameidcan troops arriving in france were supposed to have had not less than five months&apos; training beforestarting. It was evident that marry of these troops had not had such training, and, owing to the unequal degree of efficiency of the battalions sent, Sir Douglas Haig had desired to take out of eachbattalion now in France men unfit to go in the line, and put theremainder of the battalion in, though under strength. General Fochsuggested that it was more desirable to ear-mark battalions in categories according as they were ready to go into the line.The Prime Minister pointed out that, although President Wilsonwas insisting on five months&apos; training (telegram No. 235G), it was clear that the training which the American troops were receiving inAmerica was in no way adequate, and Mr. Lloyd George suggestedthat it would be better for the American troops to be brought assoon as possible, either to England or France, where they could be trained under officers who had had practical experience of modernwarfare. Mi1. Lloyd George was strongly of opinion that any proposals on this head should be clearly put forward in a memo-rand um to be laid before the Supreme War Council at Versailles byGeneral Foch, as General-in-Chief of the Allied Forces on theWestern front. There was another point which, Mr. Lloyd Georgeemphasised, was of the greatest importance, namely, the steps which were being taken by the authorities in America for having anarmy available and ready for operations in 1919.General Wilson, when asked whether General Foch had any idea as to how many American troops he required, said that he(General Wilson) aimed at 100 divisions from America; but mr. Lloyd George pointed out that, according to present arrange-ments, there would only be 42 American divisions in France by
June next year, of which 28 would be combatant divisions and 14replacement divisions.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should prepare two memoranda for the consideration of the War Cabinet.The first memorandum should show :  (i.) The number of American infantry and machine-guns available for the reinforcement of theBritish line at the present time ;(ii.) The number of such reinforcements which arelikely to be available in six weeks&apos; time ;(iii.) The total assistance which may be expected to beavailable as the result of the American promise to brigade American battalions with the british army.The second memorandum to show : (i.) The preparations which were being made by the americans to get in readiness an army avail-able for operations in 1919 ;(ii.) The recommendations which should be made atthe Supreme War Council on the subject of thenumbers and the training of this army.(6.) Before the next meeting of the Supreme War Council theChief of the Imperial General Staff should place himself in communication with General Foch, with a view to thelatter making a statement to the Supreme War Councilon the above subjects.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 27, 1918.
