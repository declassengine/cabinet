THE Director of Military Operations reported that heavy fighting was continuing between the Oise and the Marne. TheFrench were fairly well satisfied, but they had lost a certain amountof ground astride the Ourcq. The main pressure was now comingon the western part of the hue not between Chateau-Thierryand Rheims. The French were holding on to the southern portionof Chateau-Thierry, and they had blown up the bridges over theMarne. The Germans were hot reported to be across the Marne,and Rheims had not been taken.General Radcliffe stated that thirty-seven German divisions had now been absolutely identified, and probably at least forty-five divisions had been engaged. It was reported that two divisions had come from Prince RupprechPs army ; one of these, however, hadbeen an unlocated division, and Prince Rupprecht&apos;s reserves might still be said to be intact. Prince Rupprecht has eighteen fresh divisions, and the Crown Prince had two fresh divisions, while every[1365-424]
day further divisions are becoming fresh again after their month&apos;srest. In view of these enemy reserves, it was still possible that theGermans might attack in the north.The Director of Military Operations reported that the Xth french army, which had been behind the British Illrd and 1st Armies, had now been brought down, and was believed to be going into the linesouth of the Oise.Asked as to tbe possibility of a counter-offensive by the Frenchagainst the triangular-shaped wedge which the Germans had nowdriven into the French line, the Director of Military Operationsreplied that there were at present no indications of such a counter-offensive on a large scale.Newspaper 2. The Director of Military Operations said that he wished to information. bring to the notice of the Cabinet the fact that on Friday eveninglast, 31st May, the &quot; Star &quot; published a passage criticising the allied command for being &quot; surprised &quot; during the recent attack. GeneralRadcliffe said that the statement published was entirely contrary towhat had been said at 2,45 the same afternoon in the Press Fecturethat had been given by the Duke of Northumberland. A furtherPress Lecture was, therefore, being given to-day, with a view tocorrecting the impression given, and showing the harm that mightbe done. With regard to the &quot; surprise &quot; referred to, the Directorof Military Operations pointed out that enemy concentrations which occurred by night could not be discovered now by aeroplane recon-naissauce, any more than in August 19.14. The possibility of surprisewas the greater now, since the Germans had adopted the practice ofcommencing bombardment without any previous registration. this practice had been introduced by General Byng with great effect atthe battle of Cambrai.In reply to an enquiry for further details about the cause of thesuccess of the Germans, the Director of Military Operations said thathe could not answer the questions put to him on the subject, becausethe information received from the French was so very meagre.The general feeling of the Cabinet was that very little infor-mation was being received, and that, if possible, more should beobtained.In these circumstances, the War Cabinet instructed The Acting Secretary to send a telegram to the Prime Minister,from the War Cabinet, in the above seuse, and expressing the hope that he might find it possible -to arrange for fullerinformation to be transmitted.Situation at 3. With reference to War Cabinet 415, Minute 12, the First SeaMurmansk. Lord reported the receipt of a telegram from the Rear-Admiral at murmansk, to the effect that, in reply to a protest sent by M. Leninto the German Government in regard to the sinking of Russianships, the Germans had stated that sinkings would cease when theBritish withdrew from Murmansk.Asked for his opinion in regard to the position generally at murmansk, Lord Robert Cecil said that, while the matter was amilitary one, he thought that, if the Germans succeeded in gettingtogether a Finnish force of, say, 40,000 men, our position wouldbecome very hazardous. There could no longer be any doubt thatthe Soviet Government had gone over, lock, stock, and barrel, to theGermans, and it must therefore be expected that they would assistthe Germans to turn us out of Murmansk.In view of the possibility of Murmansk becoming untenable, theWar Cabinet decided that  $The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should send a telegram to General Poole, asking him for an appreciation of thesituation at Murmansk.
Life of parliament and Preparation ofNew Register:Soldiers&apos; and sailors&apos; Votes.Man-Power:Recruitment from coal Mines.4. With reference to War Cabinet 413. Minute 10, the WarCabinet took note of a memorandum by the President of the LocalGovernment Board (Paper G.T.-4712), with reference to the electoralposition of soldiers and sailors under the Representation of thePeople Act.5. With reference to War Cabinet 417, Minute 14, the WarCabinet had under consideration a letter from the Minister ofShipping, on the subject of the Recruitment from Coal Mines(Paper G.P.-4721).It was pointed out that this letter practically asked for a revision of the decision given in War Cabinet 417, Minute 14 fa).The War Cabinet requested Lord Robert Cecil, and the&apos; Committee appointed by the WarCabinet under paragraph (c) of the above-quoted minute,to deal with the question of the demands of foreigncountries for coal, to confer with the Minister of shipping on this question. If the Committee was satisfied that an alteration of the AVar Cabinet decision referred to shouldbe made, the question should again be brought before theWar Cabinet for further consideration.Safe Treatment ofExplosives at liverpool.6. The War Cabinet had under consideration a copy of a letterfrom the Secretary of the Ministry of Munitions, addressed to theSecretary of the War Cabinet, on the subject of the departmental responsibility for the safe treatment of explosives at Liverpool(Paper G.T.-4724).It was pointed out in the letter that the responsibility for thewhole arrangements connected with explosives at Liverpool was a collective one, resting upon the Admiralty, Ministry of Shipping,Ministry of Munitions, War Office, Home Office, and the MerseyDocks and Harbour Board, and that the only satisfactory arrangementappeared to be that representatives of these authorities should heconstituted an executive body and established by the authority ofthe War Cabinet.The War Cabinet approved the setting up of an officialExplosives Committee at the port of Liverpool, authorisedto take all necessary steps to safeguard the manner ofdealing with explosives at that port.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 3, 1918.
