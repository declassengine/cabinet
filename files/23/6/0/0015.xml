The Western Front. 1. THE Director of Military Operations reported that the latestnews, which he had jnst received by telephone, was better. A Frenchdivision, in co-operation with Australians, had carried out a successful counter-attack from Meteren, and had driven the enemyhalf way to Bailleul. It was understood that Wytschaete had beenrecaptured, although the situation there was not quite clear. Withregard to French assistance, the Director of Military Operationssaid that Sir Douglas Haig and Sir Herbert Plumer were both ofopinion that, in order to make our position safe in that area, it wouldbe necessary to obtain the assistance of four French divisions.Of these three divisions had already been allocated to assist our troops, and the question of the fourth was under consideration. TheDirector of Military Operations said that General Foch had no doubtthat Kemmel and the ground in front must be held. He had thought, however, that General Plumer could hold the position withthe troops which he already had. That was the point at which therewas difference of opinion, but it seemed that General Foch was now coming round to the view that it was necessary to send Frenchreinforcements.With regard to the. general situation, General Foch viewed the battle-front as one whole ; he regarded our array as bearing the brunt to good purpose, namely, in order to keep the Allied reserves,which he did not wish to fritter away, intact. General Foch&apos;sobject was to stabilise the battle with the least expenditure of reserves, although, of course, a point might come when the strain onour troops would be so great that it could not be withstood, and then there could be no stabilisation.Casualties. 2. The Director of Military Operations reported that he had heard from the Adjutant-General in France that our casualties from .1st March to loth April, inclusive, amounted to 221,000, of all ranks.German Casualties. 3. With reference to War Cabinet 391, Minute 5, the Directorof Military Intelligence said that, while he was very loth to give a figure, he believed that the German losses were in excess of ours.They might even be over 300,000. Before the fighting, the germans had 400,000 men in depots, in addition to another 100,000 menobtainable from Russia. The Director of Military Intelligencethought it improbable that, if 100,000 men came from Russia inthe form of drafts, as many as twenty additional organised divisionscould also be brought.4. The Director of Military Operations reported the withdrawalof our troops from Passchendaele, according to plans previouslyarranged. The withdrawal had begun on Sunday night, 14th April,and had been completed on Monday night, 15th April. It appeared that the Germans had not at first been aware of the withdrawal, forthey had bombarded the position after we had vacated it, and wehad. replied by counter-fire, to preserve the camouflage. It was stated that we were still holding the Pilkem Ridge, and had, there-fore, not given rip the whole of the gains secured in thatneigh boiirhood last autumn.5. With reference to War Cabinet 390, Minute 8, the PrimeMinister reported that the Shipping Controller had informed him that during this month British ships would probably bring over from 60,000 to 70,000 American troops. He estimated that during may 100,000 men would be conveyed in British ships, and during june 200,000.Withdrawal fromPasschendaele.Co-operation of theUnited States ofAmerica.
Re-forming British 0. The Secretary of State for War reported that a proposal hadDivisions. been made that the cadres of British divisions which had suffered inthe battle should be brought back to England, and that american reinforcements should be mixed in with them, and, after training,sent back to France.The Director of Military Operations said that another suggestion had been to send to Italy the divisions that had been shattered, after they had been brought up to strength by the incorporation of UnitedStates troops, at the same time replacing them in France by ourdivisions from Italy.The War Cabinet decided that This question should be raised again after the return of theChief of the Imperial General Staff.Gossip by King&apos;s 7. Attention was drawn to the fact that a Member of Parliament,Messenger. a King&apos;s Messenger, had been spreading gossip of a depressingcharacter in the Lobby of the House of Commons, in regard to theconditions in France.The Secretary of State for War was asked to see the officerconcerned.French Troops in 8. The Director  of   Military Intelligence said that he hadFlanders. received a request from General  Headquarters, France, that no mention should be made of French troops in Flanders. At the sametime it was pointed out that the enemy, from their recent experienceat Wytschaele and Meteren, must know that French troops were operating in that neighbourhood.Disposition of 9. With reference to War Cabinet 392, Minute 2, the DirectorEnemy Divisions. Qf Military Intelligence said that the enemy had moved two more divisions north of La Bassee Canal.; both of these had come fromAlsace. There were now 28 divisions north of La Bassee. and 98on the Somme, making a total of 126. There were 22 fresh german divisions on the whole of the Western battle-front. As to aroulement, after deducting Landwehr, and troops of little value,there were 34 fresh divisions, making a total 56 available for further operations.The Director of Military Operations undertook to give the PrimeMinister our figure of fresh troops available for further operations, which compared with&apos; the above-mentionedfigure of 56 German dhusions.10. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that therewere 132 German divisions at the front, of which 72 were in theactual battle line. They also had 51 tired divisions re-fittingbehind the line.General Foch&apos;confidence.11. The Director of Military Operations reported that general foch remained confident.   General Foch had asked him to convey a[1365-393] - B in reply to a question as to whether the Americans could pro-vide the men to fill the tonnage allocated, Lord Derby said that theAmerican infantry awaiting shipment amounted to about 450,000.
message, that if he had to choose between playing his own hand or that of Ludendorff, if he had to get to Berlin he would preferLudendorfPs hand, but as his mission was to check Ludendorffhe preferred his own.12. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that german divisions were still coming from Russia. One more dismountedcavalry division had been identified, holding part of the line in theVosges, making four in all. One more infantry division had arrived on the Western front, making a total of 205 in all.The Director of Military Intelligence undertook to give theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs the total number ofGerman divisions that had been moved from Russia toi the  Western front since  the Brest-Litovsk Conference.He estimated that the figure was at least fifty.Austrians on the .13. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that thereWestern Front. might possibly be 100 Austro-Hungarian batteries, or, say, 350 guns,on the Western front. The feeling appeared to be growing un austria, in view of the success of the Germans, that Austro-Hungarian troops might now with advantage be employed on theWestern front. There was a block of eight divisions in WestAustria, to the east of the Bavarian frontier, which possibly might beso employed. These eight divisions had been part of the force inGalicia and on the Roumanian frontier. They were all gooddivisions. One of them was half German, another a mixture ofMagyars and Germans, another was Polish with some Czechs in it,and two others were half Polish.Transfer of german divisions.Palestine. 14. The Director of Military Operations reported that GeneralAlienby was in touch with Faisal, and that successful attacks hadbeen made on the Hedjaz Railway north and south of Maan, and,further south, nearer Medina, inflicting losses on the enemy. north of Medina 7 miles of railway had been torn up.East Africa. 15. The Director of Military Operations reported a small checkin East Africa. General Northey&apos;s force had engaged a strongenemy force 25 miles south-west of Nanungu on the 11th April.Unexpected strength was shown by the enemy, and we had been pressed back by superior numbers to Mahua on the 12th April.The affair, however, was not of great importance.The Cattegat. 16. With reference to War Cabinet 392, Minute 4, the first sea Lord reported that our ships had returned from their sweep.  ,        into the Cattegat, that they had sustained no casualties, and had sunk twelve enemy trawlers.Murmansk. 17. With reference to War Cabinet 390, Minute 17, the WarCabinet had under consideration a memorandum (Paper G.T.-4246)by the First Sea Lord, as to the situation at Murmansk and Finnishintentions with regard to the acquisition of the Murman coast.Sir Eric Geddes expressed the view that the Senior naval officer at Murmansk should be given information as to the line ofpolicy of the Allies with regard to Murmansk, so as to be guidedaecordingby in any action he might be called upon to take, and he recommonded that he should be authorised to give the assurancesspecified in his telegram No. 264 of the 15th instant.Mr. Balfour concurred.
The First Lord stated, that, until the thaw had finished, it was-not anticipated that any military operations other than guerillawarfare would be possible in the vicinity of the Kola Inlet, andadvocated the sending of an expert military officer to Murmansk toreport, in conjunction with the Senior Naval Officer, on the situationin the event of it being possible to send at a later date a military force to co-operate with the Allied naval forces at present there.Reference was made to a recent telegram (No. 91 of the12th April) from Mr. Lockhart, which indicated that M. Trotzki was now in favour of our co-operation.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in consultationwith the First Lord, should send a telegram toMr. Lockhart agreeing on broad lines to the requests ofthe Senior Naval Officer at Murmansk, similar instruc-tidns being sent to the latter by the Admiralty ;(6.) The Secretary of State for War should send a suitablemilitary officer to Murmansk at the first opportunity forthe purpose of rendering a report on the situationgenerally, and with special reference to the possibilityof holding the Kola Inlet and the force necessary for thepurpose, such report being rendered in due course to theWar Cabinet.18. With reference to War Cabinet 390, Minute 18, the FirstLord informed the War Cabinet that an armed icebreaker and twosupply ships had been sent to Archangel, with a view to the barterof the stores they carried and generally to get on good terms withthe inhabitants of that district, who were at present indifferent to political affairs and only wished to be fed and left to pursue peacefulavocations.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed out that theposition at Archangel differed from that at Murmansk, inasmuch asthe former was involved in the general situation as to Russia andintervention by the Allies as a whole via Siberia. Pending, how-ever, a settlement of thai question, it.was felt that it might bepossible to persuade M Trotzki to agree to the Czech-Slovak forcethat was now at Kursk being employed in the Archangel orMurmansk district, with a view to preventing encroachments inRussia by forces of the Central Powers or Finland; and it waspointed out that such approval on the part of M. Trotzki would go some way to establish his honesty of purpose with regard to theAllies.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew the attentionof the War Cabinet to his telegram No. (55 of the 13th April, 1918,to Mr. Lockhart, which set out the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment with regard to Russia.The War Cabinet requested The Secretary of State for War to furnish particulars of the czech-Slovak force to the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, to enable the latter to send a telegram to Mr. Lock-hart directing him to urge M Trotzki to authorise theemployment of the force in the vicinity of Archangel and murmansk for the protection of Russian as well as Alliedinterests.Russian Black Sea 19. With reference to War Cabinet 380, Minute 5, Sir EricFleet. Geddes stated that an application had been received from theRussian Government, through the British naval attache, forassistance from us in the re-organisation of the Russian Black Sea
Siberia.Prisoners of War:Their Employmentin the Firing Zone.Greek Mobilisation.Officers&apos; Resettle-ment.fleet, which pointed to the 1generally for Allied assistance.ikelihood of the Bolsheviks asking20. The question was raised as to whether Mr, Lockhart was aware of the fact that we had given instructions that GeneralSemeneff was for the time being, at all events to cease his activities in Eastern Siberia.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook to enquire into this matter and to inform Mr. Lockhart as requisite, ifsuch bad not already been done.2.1. With reference to War Cabinet 127, Minute 5, the attentionof the War Cabinet was drawn to a question to be asked in theBouse of Commons as to the steps the Government proposed to take with reference to the atrocities committed, by the Germans on british prisoners of war, and whether instant and severe reprisalson German prisoners in our hands would not tend to mitigate theprivations of our men.Lord Derby stated that, on account of the troublesome attitudeof the German prisoners in France, it was undesirable, in thepresent situation, to employ them in the vicinity of the battle-front, and consequently they were being evacuated to England.The War Cabinet requested  The Secretary of State for War to arrange for the question inthe House of Commons to be postponed for a few days,and, in the meantime, to ascertain, as fully as possible the.,facts as to the treatment of our prisoners by the germans in the vicinity of our front, and to render a report on thesubject for the consideration of the War Cabinet.22. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by major-General Callwell (Paper G.T.-4-241).General Callweli said that the Greek mobilisation was held upmainly for want of clothing and food.The Prime Minister pointed out that it was very desirable toget some of our troops from Salonica, and this could not be doneuntil the Greeks were mobilised. It was, therefore, most important that the question of sending supplies should be settledimmediately.The War Cabinet requested  *General Smuts to settle the question, in conjunction with theDepartments concerned.23. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Report by aSub-Committee of the Ministry of Reconstruction, relative to theestablishment of an Appointments Board to deal, with the re-settlement of officers of the Army on demobilisation. Doubt was expressed as to whether the present was a suitable time foracquainting the public as to the steps that were being taken asregards demobilisation, and it was felt that, when an announcementof this nature was made, it should also cover the, arrangements that were proposed for the re-settlement of the rank and file as well asthe officers.The W&apos;ar Cabinet requested -General Smuts to go into the question with Lord Derby and dr. Addison, and to report to the War Cabinet in due  course.2. Whitehall Gardens, S.W.April 1 7, 101.8.
