The enemy attack in this vicinity was madeyesterday with 6 divisions, of which 3, or possibly 4, were employed against us, and 2, or possibly 3, against the French. Asregards the French, it appeared that they were holding Hangardvillage, but they had lost the cemetery at the north. Communica-tion by telephone was bad this morning, but, as far as could begathered, an attack had. been started by the enemy against theposition Kemmel-Wytschaete, which, it was understood, was nowbeing defended by the French.The Belgian Front.2.

Qf State for Foreign Affairs mentioned that he had not yet receivedthe instructions of the Cabinet as to the reply that he was to make to the Portuguese Government with regard to their desire to sendfurther reinforcements to France.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff pointed out that,although the Portuguese troops might be considered fair, the officers were inefficient, and that, from a military point of view, it was notadvisable to ask our men to lie alongside them in the line.The question was raised as to whether it would be possible to incorporate Portuguese troops in our battalions or brigades, in thesame manner as was being adopted with regard to American troops;but it was pointed out that the American troops were coming in under their own officers, and that, unless British officers replacedthe Portuguese officers, this course as regards the Portuguese wouldbe undesirable.The War Cabinet requested The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to take the necessarydiplomatic action with a view to preventing any furtherPortuguese reinforcements being sent.

Mr. Balfour advocated sending the facts of the case to Lord Reading, leaving to his discretion what enquirieshe should make or what pressure he should put upon the UnitedStates authorities in the matter.Some particulars in regard to this subject, from the First Lordof the Admiralty (Paper G.T.-4252), -in the details of which theMinister of Shipping generally concurred, were handed to Mr. Balfour,who undertook to telegraph them to Lord Reading.The War &quot;Cabinet authorised Further action being left to Lord Reading&apos;s discretion.Prices of Sulphate 12.

They also notedthat Mr. Chamberlain had ruled that, in the event of further rises in cost of acid or bags during the year 1918 or 1919, the increased cost should fall upon public funds, unless the increase was of sucha serious character as to require a reconsideration of the question.Wheat for Italy. 13. With reference to War Cabinet 398, Minute 5, Mr. Cham-berlain reported that arrangements had been made with the Ministerof Shipping and the Wheat Commission for from 20,000 to 25,000tons of wheat to be diverted to Italy, the Italian Government beinginformed as soon as the actual amount had been fixed.Indian Reforms :Grant of King&apos;commissions to indians.14. With reference to War Cabinet 203, Minute 1, the WarCabinet had before them correspondence between the India Officeand the Government of India on the subject of commissions fornatives of India (Paper G.T.-4328). The latest of these documentswas a telegram, dated the 22nd April, 1918, from the Viceroy,asking for sanction to a series of proposals.Lord Islington explained that a decision was asked for at such short notice because, in pursuance of the Prime Ministersappeal to India, the A^iceroy was addressing a conference repre-senting &quot; all India&quot; at Delhi on the 27th, and woidd be greatlyfortified by being able to announce a generous concession of coin-missions to Indian soldiers. The Viceroy&apos;s proposals were asfollows : (a.) Permanent commissions.(i.) That an announcement of the grant of ten permanentKiug&apos;s commissions yearly, through Sandhurst,might be made ;(ii.) That an announcement of the grant of King&apos;s corn-missions to a maximum of twenty selected indian officers specially distinguished in the war might bemade.
5WG 399(b.) Temporary commissions.That temporary King&apos;s commissions should be grantedduring the war, on the same conditions as apply toBritish candidates for temporary commissions in theIndian Army, to the maximum number of 200, onnomination by loyal Governments and General- Officers Commanding, and approval by the Com-mander-in-Chief and the Viceroy.(c.) Honorary co mmiss i ons.That an announcement might be made of the grant ofhonorary King&apos;s commissions to old and distinguishedIndian officers still on the Active List, up to an estab-lisbment of one per infantry battalion and other arms in proportion, this established number to be filled upgradually.Lord Islington stated that at a conference between the IndiaOffice and the War Office on the previous day, agreement had beenreached on (a) (i).As to (a) (ii), the War Office desired to add a proviso that eachselection should be subject to the recommendation of the three seniorBritish officers of the regiment to which the candidate belonged andto which he was to be posted as a commissioned officer, and that his acceptance by the three officers mentioned as a second lieutenant intheir own regiment should be a condition of his appointment.As to (e), there was also agreement. The new feature in thisproposal was that hitherto honorary Kings commissions had only been granted to risaldars and subadars on their retirement. Theywere now to be offered honorary commissions while still on the active list.As to (6), the military authorities were unable to concede whatthe Viceroy proposed.   They suggested the following alternative : That the Government of fndia should be authorised to grant acertain number of cadetships in the already existing officercadre known as &quot; The Native Land Forces,&quot; a cadrewhich, while it bestows British rank, does not confer anycommand over British troops. (It was from this cadrethat the nine British commissions were given in August191.7.) That, after training, those considered suitableshould be gazetted second lieutenants in the same cadre,and that the best of these might ultimately become eligiblefor the King&apos;s commission.These Commissions in Native Land Forces did not confer seniorityover any British officer or soldier, as would be the case with officersholding King&apos;s commissions. It was further proposed that the sameproviso as stipulated in (a) (ii) should apply to the conversion of such these officers as might have qualified for it into holders of per-manent King&apos;s commissions.In the discussion that followed, there was general concurrence in respect to proposals (a) and (c). On the subject of the temporarycommissions, it was pointed out that the Viceroy&apos;s proposals weredangerous, inasmuch as they might tend to create, after the war,another discontented class. Two hundred was a large munber,and, possibly, should the Cabinet adopt the War Office alternative proposal, the Viceroy would not desire to adhere to it. A strong-argument against the Viceroy&apos;s proposal for temporary commissionswas that it Would discourage British recruitment of officers for theIndian Army. The alternative, which offered temporary rankwithout command over British troops, was a mitigation of this result,though it did not overcome the difficulty, previously experienced inrespect of the Imperial Cadet Corps, of finding suitable employment[1365-399] C
for the nominees, and might not dispel the danger of producing inthe end a group of disappointed public servants. The alternative,however, was more acceptable.Lord Curzon expressed the hope that the twenty officers to be selected under (a) (ii) should not be chosen exclusively, as themajority of their nine predecessors had been, from officers who had served in France.   Service in all theatres of war should count.Lord Islington agreed to bring this point to the notice of theGovernment of India.Lord Islington was further requested to telegraph privately tothe Viceroy and ask him to give the War Cabinet more time infuture to form decisions on matters of such importance.The War Cabinet decided that-The India Office should telegraph to the Viceroy their assent tothe following proposals : (a.) (i.) That  an  announcement  of  the   grant   of  tenpermanent King&apos;s commissions yearly, throughSandhurst, might be made ;(ii.) That an announcement of the grant of King&apos;commissions,    and    the   rank   of   Second-Lieutenant, to a maximum number of twentyselected Indian officers specially distinguishedin the war, might be made, subject to the proviso that the three senior British officersof the regiment concerned recommended the candidate and accepted  him  as   a   Second-Lieutenant in their own regiment;(6.) That the Government of India should be authorised togrant a certain number of cadetships, within amaximum of  200, in the already existing OfficerCadre known as &quot;The Native  Land  Forces,&quot; acadre which, while it bestows British rank, does notconfer any command  over British troops ;   that,after training, those considered suitable should begazetted Second-Lieutenants in the same cadre, andthat the best of these  might ultimately become eligible for the Kings commission, srubject to therecommendation of the three senior British officersof the regiment, and the condition that the latter were prepared to accept die nominee as a Second-Lieutenant in their own. regiment ;(e.) That an announcement might be made of the grant ofHonorary  King^s   commissions  to   old and   dis-distinguished Indian officers still on the active list, upto an establishment of one per infantry battalionand other arms in proportion ; this establishmentnumber to be filled up gradually.15. The Chancellor of the Exchequer asked that time should begiven for the Treasury to examine the proposals for the shipment ofsovereigns to India, contained in Paper G.T.-4327, which the WarCabinet were asked to consider.It was decided that The question should be considered by the India Office and theTreasury, and, only failing agreement between them, bereferred again for discussion by the War Cabinet. In caseof agreement, the conclusions would be held to haveCabinet sanction, and should be communicated to theSecretary.
Resignation.The Chief of theAir Staff.Man-power:The Demand on agriculture.16. The Prime Minister read a letter from Lord Rothermereasking for acceptance of his resignation of the post of Secretary ofState for the Air, on the grounds of ill-health, from which he had suffered for some time.The War Cabinet much regretted that the state of LordRothermere&apos;s health appeared to render impossible any course otherthan acceptance of his resignation, and the Prime Minister undertook to write a letter in this sense to Lord Rothermere, thanking him forthe services he had rendered in amalgamating the Royal Air Serviceand the Royal Naval Air Service into&apos; the Royal Air Force.17. With reference to War Cabinet 398, Minute 4, there was ashort discussion in regard to the forthcoming debates in parliament on the subject of General Trenchard&apos;s resignation from the post of chief of the Staff of the Air Ministry.Lord Curzon pointed out that, as at present contemplated, theHouse of Lords would meet specially on Monday in order to hold a debate on the question at the same time as the debate in the Houseof Commons.The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to inform lord curzon if there should be any alteration in regard to the debate in the House of Commons.Lord Curzon undertook to ascertain from Lord Rothermorewhether he personally was desirous of a debate in the Houseof Lords, in order that his case might be stated.18. With reference to War Cabinet 395, Minute 12, the attentionof the War Cabinet was drawn to a memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries (Paper G.T.-4308) on thesubject of the demand it was proposed to make on agriculture formilitary man-power.The War Cabinet agreed that In the first instance, the question should be discussed, on theinitiative of Lord Milner, between Lord Milner, Sir auckland geddes and Mr. Prothero, and that, if they were unable toreach an agreement, the question should be brought beforethe War Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,April 25, 1918.
