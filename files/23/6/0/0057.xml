The number of enemy troops that were rested and re-trained continued to increase. PrinceRupprecht now had 26 fresh divisions in reserve and 33 availablefor roulement. On the whole front there were now 32 fresh divisions in reserve and 57 available for roulement. Altogether,Prince Rupprecht had 93 divisions, and the Crown Prince had 79.Signs of a possible attack were to be found in the fact that therehad been no special transfer of troops on the part of the enemy from north to south. The opinion at General Headquarters confirmed the view of General Foch as to the part of the front where theGerman attack most probably would be made. At the same time itwas by no means certain that the main attack would take place onthis part of the line ; it might well be a subsidiary attack, with the
main attack elsewhere, at a place indicated hy the Director ofMilitary Intelligence. On the whole, the weather had beenunfavourable to the Germans, hut probably it was not had enoughto prevent an attack, because the ground had been-very dry.2. With reference to War Cabinet 430, Minute 8, the Directorof Military Intelligence said that General Bridges had reported thatthe shipment of American troops would drop to two divisionsmonthly in August and the succeeding months.The War Cabinet were of opinion that this question of american reinforcements must be taken up again, and decided that The matter should be raised at the forthcoming meeting of theSupreme War Council.The Italian Front. 3. The Director of Military Intelligence said that the Italiansituation was exceedingly favourable. During the night of the22nd-23rd June the Austrian troops had begun to evacuate theMontello. They had been crossing the Biave partly by ferry andpartly by wading. The Italian troops had advanced and had reachedthe &quot; Chord &quot; line by 9 a.m. By 2 p.m. the Montello had been sweptbare of the Austrian troops. The Italians had taken several hundredprisoners ; they had recovered 72 lost Italian guns, and had captured- some Austrian field artillery. The Italian troops were throwingbridges at Falze, and were organising an extensive bridgehead there and opposite Nervosa. The XIth Corps had moved up to the riverhank along the whole front. The XXVIIIth Corps had reached thehank with its left flank, hut its right was still meeting with resistance.The XXIIIrd Corps had advanced its whole front about half the depth of the enemy&apos;s occupation of the previous day. In this sector also the enemy was fighting a determined rearguard action,in order to cover the withdrawal of the remaining troops on theright bank bj the road bridges at San Dona, which appeared to beintact. At San Dona and near Grisolera were the only bridgesavailable to the enemy. The Italians, however, were throwingbridges and organising bridgeheads at Ponte di Piave and other points. Orders had been given for the withdrawal and reformingof all the Italian divisions which had suffered in the fighting, andGeneral Badoglio estimated that they would be completely reformedand ready for further service in about a fortnighPs time. Withregard to casualties, General Delme-Radchffe had estimated that theItalian casualties of all descriptions were well under 80,000.The Director of Military Intelligence undertook to provide thePrime Minister with the materials for a statement on thissubject, to be made in the House of Commons the same afternoon.Siberia. 4. The Director of Military Intelligence reported the receipt ofa telegram from Captain Steveni, from Pfarbin, dated the 21st June,from which it appeared that a fight had taken place betweenSemenoffs force and that of the Bolsheviks. Semenoifs troopsnumbered about 2,000, and the Bolshevist forces were about 10,000,including some 8,000 German and Austrian prisoners. Semenoffsforce had suffered casualties in number about 200; they had succeeded in driving the enemy from the railway, and the situation was considered satisfactory. It had been feared at one time that ifSemenoffs force entered Manchuria they would be disarmed by.theChinese, but now arrangements had been made with the Chinesewhereby semenoff&apos;s men would not be disarmed unless they retiredalong the railway.   On the 20th June a meeting had been held atAmericanReinforcements.
East Africa. 5. The Director of Military Intelligence explained, with the aid of a map, the recent operations reported from East Africa.Submarines. 6. The First Sea Lord said that the Admiral commanding theNorthern Patrol reported that vessels under his orders had sunk anenemy submarine by gunfire, after a hunt extending over 100 miles,and lasting from 10&apos;45 a.m. on the 19th to 6 a.m. on the 20th June,The submarine was finally sunk 481- miles west of Sands Bank,Faroe Islands.

The engines sank, andthe envelope was. wrecked ; five of the crew were picked up byH.M.S. &quot;Moy &quot; and landed at Rosvd), he remaining five members ofthe crew being presumed drowned.Russia: 8. With reference to War Cabinet 429, Minute 2, the DirectorThe Caucasus. Q^ Military Intelligence reported that considerable trouble had arisen in the Caucasus between the Germans and the Turks on the question as to who should occupy the town of Baku first. An arrangementhad been arrived at between the German Higher Command atConstantinople and Enver Pasha, that the forces of neither country should advance beyond a neutral zone which had been agreed upon.The Turks were, however, not conforming to this agreement, were still pushing on towards Baku, and a force of 7,000 had advanced to a point within 13 miles of Kurdamir (80 miles west of Baku) andhad sent a, detachment of 3,000 men to turn that town from thenorth. The Germans were complaining that the Turks had, contraryto their agreement, advanced north of Karakliss along the TiflisRailway and had entrenched themselves at Kardehan Station, wherethey had fired on the Germans. General Macdonogh explained thatthe German military authorities had sent instructions to the effectthat an attack on Baku was to be prevented, as they were afraid that if the Turks and the Tartars got into the town they would lootit and fire the oil wells. The Germans were getting reinforcements from the Ukraine, and then proposed to advance on Baku. GeneralMacdonogh stated that Baku was full of Armenians, who werefrightened of the Turks.The Prime Minister said that this was a remarkable situationand asked whether advantage could not be taken of the fact thatHarbin, consisting o  90 per cent. Socialists from various parts ofSiberia. They had asked for intervention to help Russia to restore the Eastern front and to annul the Brest-Litovsk treaty.It was pointed out that this information would be of value in soliciting American assistance in the matter, and supportedstatements made by the Prime Minister in a conversation he had had with the Japanese Ambassador.The War Cabinet decided that The Director of Military Intelligence should give the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs a paraphrase of the telegramreferred to, in order that Mr. Balfour might communicateits contents to the Japanese Ambassador.
the Turks and Germans had fallen out on this question. He pointedout that the Turks were more anxious to acquire this rich countrythan they were to regain Mesopotamia or Palestine, and suggestedthat some peace arrangement might he arrived at with the TurkishGovernment hy which the Turanian territory might he given to them.Lord Curzon stated that the question of Baku was being fully discussed by the Eastern Committee that afternoon, and pointedout that a telegram had been received that morning to the effect thatGeneral Bicharakoff had been to Baku and returned, and that areport was expected from him in the course of a day or so. GeneralDunsterville had also been anxious to take a force there, but he hadbeen dissuaded from this course, as all the troops available were required for the Persian cordon. Lord Curzon also expressed theopinion that, to satisfy the Pan-Turanian ambitions of the TurkishGovernment, it would be necessary to give up the district ofAzerbaijan, but that, in view of the fact that we were protecting therights of Persia, it seemed to him impossible for us to barter a portion of Persian territory.Mr. Lloyd George expressed the opinion that it would be better for us for the Turks to hold Baku, as it was not probable theywould ever be dangerous to our interests in the East, whilst, on theother hand, Russia, if in the future she became regenerated, mightbe so.The Alien Question. g. The War Cabinet had a short discussion on the treatment of aliens, and on certain statements contained in Sir Edward Troup&apos;smemorandum (Paper G.T.-4931) regarding the internment of enemy aliens.The Prime Minister said that no doubt a good papercase could be made defending the action taken by the HomeOffice, particularly in regard to each individual concerned. Hehad, however, in mind cases with which Sir Edward Troup&apos;smemorandum did not deal. For instance, that of Sir Joseph Jonas(an ex-Lord Mayor of Sheffield), who had been fifty or sixty years inthis country, and had made munificent grants to education, and alsoposed as a strong anti-German, but was now accused of having giveninformation to the enemy before the war. The Prime Minister theninstanced several cases of men of German nationality, or whose rela-tives were German, holding responsible positions in GovernmentDepartments. He felt that, during the war, when examiningindividual cases of this sort, the benefit of the doubt must be givento the State, notwithstanding that, in ordinary times, the benefit ofany doubt was, in this country, always given to the individual.The Director of Military Intelligence said that this was a diffi-culty with which he had always had to contend. When a casecame before the Advisory Committee it was always assumed that theman was innocent until he had been proved guilty. This greatlyhampered the work of the Intelligence Department, on whom wasthrown the onus of proof.Mr. Chamberlain, acting on behalf of the Home Office in theabsence of Sir G. Cave, said that this statement was not acceptableby that Department.The Prime Minister then read to the War Cabinet some sugges-tions he had received from a very able business man for dealing withthe alien question.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) If the alien question was raised in the House of Commonsa reply should be given to the effect that Sir George Cavewas away, and that, as soon as he returned, an answerwould be given.(b.) On Sir George Cave&apos;s return the War Cabinet should resume the examination of this question.
Soldiers&apos; and sailors&apos; pay committee.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 24, 1918.10. With reference to War Cabinet 411, Minute 26, the WarCabinet had under consideration a letter from the Chancellor of theExchequer, requesting that the question of the increase in the rateof separation allowances now being paid to the wives and dependants of sailors and soldiers, which had been raised in the House ofCommons, should be referred to the Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; pay committee.The Secretary pointed out that no member of the War cabinet had been appointed to the Chairmanship of this Committee sincethe resignation of Sir Edward Carson.The War Cabinet requested Mr. Barnes to undertake the Chairmanship of the Soldiers&apos; and sailors&apos; Pay Committee.
