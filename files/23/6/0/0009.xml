THE Director of Military Operations informed the WarCabinet that the euemy, after a heavy bombardment on a front of15,000 yards between La Bassee and Armentieres, had made anattack with four divisions. By the latest information it appeared that the enemy had only entered our front line at Fauquissart andLa Cordonnerie Farm.General Maurice stated that it appeared probable that the attack was of the nature of a demonstration only, as the front onwhich the attack was made was large for the force employed andwas a very intricate one and strongly entrenched.fl365-387] B
2General Maurice explained on a map the new lines of defence that had been and were being made in rear of the British front, tiestated that, from information received, the fighting on the western front on the 7th instant was of a very severe nature, and it appeared that the Germans made a very determined attempt to get through,but were repulsed with very heavy losses. Since the attack, theAustralian divisions had taken over the whole of that portion of thefront and had captured Bouzeneourt.Macedonia. 2.  The Director of Military Operations informed the WarCabinet that information had been received from General Guillaumatto the effect that a peace propaganda was being carried out to agreat extent amongst the Serbian officers on the Macedonian front,and that General Guillaumat took a serious view of such action.Co-operation of the 3.  With reference to War Cabinet 386, Minute 3, GeneralUnited States of Whigham informed the War Cabinet that he had just returnedAmerica. from France, where he had seen General Pershing in connectionwith the transport of American troops to France and their employ-ment in British and French divisions. This was the meeting atwhich General Hutchinson had been present. General Pershinghad stated that he had seen it mentioned that 120,000 men per month,composed of infantry and machine-gun units, were to be transportedduring the next four months to Europe, with a view to theirincorporation, but that he did not know the basis on which thesefigures had been arrived at. Although Mr. Baker, who was present at the meeting, confirmed the views General Whigham had ex-pressed, General Pershing had reverted to his original scheme of bringing the men across in divisions, and stated that he requiredguns and equipment for such divisions. Furthermore, general pershing did not appear to visualise that any troops incorporated inBritish and French divisions would long remain there. He was further in favour of all replacement troops being at his disposaland not that of the Allies. As regards the agreement arrivedat on the 27th March by the Military Representatives of theSupreme War Council, to the effect that for the present onlyinfantry and machine-gun units should be despatched from.America, General Pershing had stated that he looked upon that agreement as only a temporary one, and subject to alteration.In reply to a question as to what number of troops the Britishmight expect to receive, General Pershing had agreed that weshould, receive the 60,000 during April which come throughEngland, after which he would reconsider the question. GeneralWhigham said that he had gathered that General Bliss was infavour of carrying out the agreement, and that Mr. Baker, who had sailed for America the previous day, also agreed to the necessity forthe maximum suitable American reinforcements being utilised inaccordance with the Versailles Agreement. Summing up theattitude of General Pershing, General Whigham added that hehad had created in his mind the impression that General Pershingwanted to make a United States army instead of helping us duringthe critical summer mouths. Difficulties had also arisen as regardsthe training of the American Higher Command, but GeneralWhigham had made suggestions which seemed acceptable toGeneral Pershing, and had added that if, in original British divisions,American troops ultimately predominated, American commandersmight be placed in command, and British guns and gunners placed at their disposal. Mr. Baker had been very helpful throughout theConference.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the WarCabinet that he had seen General Hutchinson on this matter, andhad despatched a telegram to Lord Reading setting out the situation
3 WC 387as iiad been explained by General Whigham, and requesting lord reading to bring to the notice of the authorities at Washington the apparent difference of opinion between General Pershing, on theone side, and what we conceive to be the Presidents policy, onthe other.   A paraphrase of the telegram appears in the Appendix.Vladivostock. 4, With reference to War Cabinet 386, Minute 7, the deputy first Sea Lord reported that a telegram had been received from the captain of H.M.S. &quot; Suffolk,&quot; dated the 8th April, saying that noarmed force had been landed from the U.S.S. &quot; Brooklyn,&quot; and thatWashington had not supported the view put forward by the AmericanAdmiral as to the use of force, if necessary, in the event of anyattempt being made to send Allied stores away from Vladivostock.The telegram further stated that the Japanese Government had- expressed themselves as ready to support the Japanese Admiral inthe event of Bolshevist opposition. It further appeared that theJapanese Admiral had proposed to his Government the desirabilityof disarming the Red Guard, and encouraging the local authoritiesto form a strong militia for the xnirpose of adequately policing thetown. The Captain of the &quot; Suffolk &quot; was of opinion, however, thatthe disarming of the Red Guard was impracticable without occupa-tion, as it could not be carried out except by military intervention,and had added that it was essential to contemplate the possibility of active opposition by the Bolsheviks by the arrival of reinforcements from Siberia, in which case a new situation would be created. Itappeared that no disturbances had taken place at Vladivostock sincethe parties had landed.Mr. Balfour stated that in this matter there were divergentviews between the United States of America and ourselves, and thatthe former had not supported us. Our present action had been entirely of a local nature for the protection of British subjects inVladivostock, and that the Japanese had only landed 200 men, and ourselves 50.Lord Derby- added that we had a battalion at Hong-Kongearmarked for Vladivostock in case its services were required there.The GlycerinePosition.*5. The War Cabinet had under consideration Paper G.T-4032,by the Ministry of Munitions, on the Glycerine Position in 1918, andalso a note by the Food Controller (Paper G.T.-4114).Lord Curzon stated that he Avas agreeable, if so desired, to settlethis matter on behalf of the War Cabinet, and the AVar Cabinetrequested him to be good enough to do so.Tobacco Stocks.*6. Lord Curzon further stated that he was willing to go intothe question of the present position of tobacco stocks in this country(Paper G.T.-3988), and the question as to whether airy restrictions should be placed on the consumption of the Naval and MilitaryForces at home and abroad, and the civil population in this country.The War Cabinet authorised -Lord Curzon. to act on their behalf in this matter.Organisation ofGovernmentOffices.*7. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (Paper G.T.-4143) as to enquiries intothe organisation and staffing Of Government Offices, Avhich indicated that, in order to enable the Committee which had been appointedto consider this matter to make further progress, it was essentialthat they should be authorised to make investigations in the Depart-[1365-387]B 2

It was therefore proposed that two inspectorsshould be appointed for each Department.The War Cabinet authorised the appointment of theseinspecting officers, and invited the Departments to afford the same every facility in carrying out their work.*8. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandumby Mr. Long (Paper G.T.-3896), a memorandum by Lord RobertCeeil (Paper G.T.-3941), and a memorandum by Lord Islington(Paper G.T.-3980) in connection with the provision of extra accom-modation for the Foreign Office.It was mentioned that possibly an extension of the ForeignOffice might be made by erecting temporary buildings on theParade Ground in the vicinity of the Foreign Office.The War Cabinet directed The Secretary to write to Lord Robert Cecil suggesting that heshould state his requirements to the First Commissioner ofWorks and ask for any suggestions the latter might make to provide the requisite accommodation required by theForeign Office.*9. With reference to the First and Second Reports on RawMaterials (Paper G.T.-4015 and 4015a) by the Committee on trade relations of the United Kingdom within the Empire, the WarCabinet decided that Subject to the approval of the Secretary of State for theColonies, copies of these reports should be sent to theseveral Dominions as soon as possible by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies.*10. With reference to a memorandum by the Chief of theImperial General Staff (Paper G.T.-3969) relative to the develop-ment and supply of tanks, General Maurice stated that the wholequestion hinged on the supply of men, and that quite apart from themen required for manning additional tanks, there was a minimum of man-power required for holding the trenches, and we were not atpresent getting that minimum; consequently, there were no men available for tanks.It was mentioned that 45,000 men would be required forthe neAV tank programme, and that South Africa, Canada, and NewZealand had expressed their willingness to assist in providing acertain amount of man-power to meet this number, but that probablyno more than 2,000 would be obtained from these sources.The War Cabinet felt that the question of the increased tankprogramme depended on the result of the Man-Power Bill whichwas to be introduced into Parliament that day, and decided that The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should again raise thisquestion of the increased tank programme when the man-power situation was clearer.As regards the food situation, Lord Milner informed, theWar Cabinet that he was going into the matter, and that the presentposition as regards supplies was much better than had been anticipated some few months ago. The consideration of the re-organisation of the Ministry of Food had not yet, however, reachedsuch a stage that it could bejrought before the War Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.WApril 9, 1918.* The items marked with an asterisk were only discussed very briefly andwithout the presence of the heads of Departments concerned.
APPENDIX.Paraphrase of Telegram sent to Lord Reading on April 8, 1918.   No, 2017.A CONVERSATION took place in Paris on the 7th instant between GeneralHutchinson and General Pershing and Mr. Baker, the gist of which has somewhatalarmed us.According to General Pershing, it has never been promised that United Statesinfantry and machine-gun units should be transported during four months&apos;at the rateof 120,000 a mouth for incorporation in British and French divisions.All that be recognises is an agreement to transport during the month of April, inBritish vessels, 00,000 United States infantry and machine-gun units appertaining tothe six divisions, these to be incorporated on arrival in British divisions. You will remember that, before the German offensive had begun or Mr. Lloyd George hadappealed to President Wilson, this proposal was, in substance, agreed to.It became apparent during the conversation that the view held by general pershing is that these six American divisions should be only a very short time with british troops and then incorporated in the American army now in construction. Hisopinion apparently is that the infantry units from these six divisions should, on their withdrawal from the British divisions, be replaced by a similar number of mentransported from the United States.From the account of the interview, it is obvious that the views held by general pershing are entirely opposed to those which, we understand, have been accepted by president. Wilson. General Pershing will admit of no promise that during the next four months 480,000 American infantry and machine-gun units should be incorporated in British or French divisions and does not attempt to hide the fact that he disapprovesof this policy, and herein lies the chief point of disagreement.A less important point of difference is that the British Government does not approve of the policy of withdrawing American troops in British and French divisionsuntil October or -November, when the season, for active operation purposes, will beat an end.Although loth to trouble President Wilson with any criticisms of his officers, thematter must be cleared up, as it is obvious that the widely-differing view held byGeneral Pershing, on the one hand, and the President, on the other, is a fundamentalone and bears on the result of this present battle, and, possibly, on the issue ofthe war.The means by which our views can best and most expeditiously be impressed onthe United States Government I leave entirely to your discretion, knowing that youfully realise the great importance of the matter.General Bfiss and Mr. Baker are, I believe, broadly speaking, of the same opinon as ourselves, and the latter, who attended the meeting between Generals Hutchinsonand Pershing, is leaving France to-day for America.
