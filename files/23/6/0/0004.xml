GENERAL TRENCHARD stated the following figures asto the Royal Air Force Avork during the recent battle: He said that319 tons of bombs had been dropped between the 19th March andthe 1st April; over 1,000,000 rounds of ammunition had been firedon ground targets ; 244 enemy aeroplanes had been destroyed and122 driven down out of control; 3GC machines and 283 pilots hadbeen sent from England to the Expeditionary Force since the21st March, making a total of 089 for the month. In addition tothis, two new squadrons had been sent out ; 437 British machines had been wrecked on our side of the line, and 113 of our machines were missing. General Trenchard explained that the large numberof machines wrecked was owing to the amount of low flying takingplace; also that such low flying machines get badly shot about.He estimated that roughly 300 out of these -137 machines could be repaired.   He added that the casualties had been heavy, primarily[ 365-382]
due to machine-gun fire from the ground ; 210 pilots had been killed, wounded, or missing, and 105 observers killed, wounded, ormissing. General Trencharcl stated that, except in the case of one squadron, and that only for one day, all the squadrons in Franceduring the battle had been up to strength both in pilots and inmachines. As regards the enemy aircraft on the battle-front,General Trenchard stated that it was estimated that there were666 German machines on the 18th March and 888 on the2nd April. This latter estimate was made on the assumptionthat the enemy&apos;s units were maintained at full strength, but,from information received, it was known that in many casesthe enemy had not been able to maintain the full authorisedestablishment by replacing casualties. General Trencharcl statedthat the majority of the Royal Air Force equipment was remove?!from the aerodromes which had to be evacuated, and thattemporary aerodromes had been erected in sufficient numbers toenable all the squadrons to operate. General Trenchard added thatthere was a feeling at the Front that we had attained definitesupremacy in the air on the battle-front, and that our men were doing far more work in the air than was being carried out by theGermans.The War Cabinet informed General Trenchard that they considered his statement a very gratifying one, which was entirelyborne out by what the Prime Minister had heard at the Front inthis respect.Bequisitioning of farm Lands for naval and military purposes.2.
