The Western \. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theFront: Germans yesterday morning made a heavy attack between AlbertGerman Attack. anJ Moreuil, the weight of the attack being to the south of the somme. The enemy had driven us from Hamel and the Boisde Vaire, and our line immediately south of the Somme ran approxi-mately west of Hamel, west of Bois de Vaire, east of Villers-Brettoneux, to Hangard, where we joined the French. Reportsindicated that the French had given ground between Moreuil andMailly Raineval. It was stated that the Amiens-Paris railwaywas the enemy&apos;s objective. 20 German divisions had been em-ployed in the attack, of which 0 were fresh. A total of between87 and 92 German divisions had, so far, been identified. Theenemy was carrying out the process of thinning his line, so that hehad now 20 fresh divisions in reserve. The roulement had not yetstarted. In the recent attack the Germans had employed 12, divisions against 4^- French divisions, although the French hadample divisions in this region, which would, no doubt, be employedin the most suitable manner, the probable nature of which was indicated by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff. On the british front 8 German divisions had been engaged.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that there was an enemy concentration between Albert and Bucquoy, and heavy artillery fire was going on in this neighbourhood ; 7 fresh german divisions had been located north of Arras.Loss of H.M.S. 2. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that an old destroyer, His&quot;Bittern.&quot; Majesty&apos;s ship &quot;Bittern,&quot; was sunk on the previous night 24 milesfrom Berry Head, as the result of a collision with the steamship&quot; Kenilworth.&quot; No trace of the vessel had been found, and no boatsor survivors had so far been picked up.Sinking of Kussian 3. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated, in answer to a question,Warships. that no confirmation had been received by the Admiralty of thereport in the press that the Russians had sunk some of their warships in the Baltic.Go-ordination ofAllied operations on the western front.4. With reference to War Cabinet, 382, Minute 9, the WarCabinet had before them a telegram (Paper G.T.-4I35) fromM. Clemenceau, dated the 3rd April, 1918, in which he suggestedthat the Beauvais Agreement should be extended in order to allow the Allied forces in Italy to come under General Foch&apos;s command.The War Cabinet decided that-The Prime Minister should reply to M. Clemenceau in the sense that, for the present, we thought it inadvisable to burdenGeneral Foch with the additional responsibilities of theItalian front, and that the matter should be left for thepresent to the Supreme War Council at Versailles.An ti-Keor ui tingStrikes.5. Mr. Barnes drew the attention of the War Cabinet to amemorandum (Paper G.T.-4119) circulated by Sir Auckland Geddes,in which he proposed to enlist in the army the strikers of military age in any anti-recruiting strikes that might occur. Mr. Barnes was of the opinion that the responsibility for such action was too greatto be left in the hands of one man, especially as the labour situation at the moment was extraordinarily good, and any hasty action indealing with anti-recruiting strikes might result in disturbing thelabour peace which at present exists.
7. With reference to War Cabinet 303, Minute 16, the attentionof the War Cabinet was drawn to statements in the press on thesubject of the erection of a great National War Museum. It waspointed out that the report of Lord Crawf6rd&apos;s Committee had notyet been discussed by the War Cabinet.8. With reference to War Cabinet 377, Minute LI, the WarCabinet had under consideration the draft of a Bill to make further provision with respect to service in His Majesty&apos;s forces during thepresent war (Paper G.T.-4124 (Appendix, attached)), together withthe report of the Committee (Paper G-.-204), and memoranda bvDr. Addison (Paper G.T.-4118) and Mr. Duke (Paper G.T.-4.133). &quot;The Age Limit. 9. With reference to the age limit, it was suggested that thelimit of age provided for in section 1 (1), sub-section (a), might giverise to considerable opposition in the blouse of Commons.The Minister of National Service regarded this provision as veryessential, pointing out that there were certain classes of men whom it would probably be necessary to call up up to the age of 55.These classes included members of the medical profession and skilledpersonnel, such as mechanics. He pointed out also that he ought tohave the power to call up large numbers of men, even if onlytemporarily, to meet any great and immediate national emergency.He agreed that men between the ages of 50 and 55 would rarely, ifever, be used for fighting purposes, but, at the same time, it wasnecessary for him to have the power to complete labour units,especially as indentured labour might not be re-engaged.A suggestion was put forward that men of the ages between 50and 55 should be called up according to classes.Sir Auckland Geddes did not consider that this was eitheradvisable or practicable. He stated that sub-clause (6) would give to the Miuistr3r of National Service the power of distribution of doctors, and that they would be able to allocate them to the dis-tricts where their services were most urgently required. Underthis scheme the interests of public health would be watched over bythe President of the Local Government Board, and the interests of individuals by the National Health Insurance Commissioners.The general opinion was expressed that, at the present moment,this clause would be well received in the House of Commons.The War   Cabinet  approved clause 1, sub-section (1), (a)and (b).Shipping for united states troops.Imperial WarMuseum.Amendment of theMilitary service acts.6. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to telegramNo. 1406, dated the 4th April, 1918, from Lord Reading, in whichhe stated that only ships enough to carry 21,000 United states troops during the month of April had been notified to the ShippingDepartment in the United States, instead of ships enough to carry60,000 troops, as agreed to by us.It was pointed out, however, that the matter had been adjustedby the Director of Transports, and that arrangements had alreadybeen made for the transportation of the agreed number of american troops to Europe during the month of April.The War Cabinet requested The (Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to communicate withthe Director of Transports and obtain from him theinformation necessary to reply to Lord Reading, and to reassure the latter on the point raised in his telegram.
Ministers of 10. The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet a letter heEehgion. received from the Archbishop of Canterbury, in which the archbishop stated that lie could assure the War Cabinet that theclergy were ready to answer to any call which might be made upon them.Sir George -Cave said he had seen the Archbishop, and receiveda similar personal assurance.The Secretary of State for War was of opinion that sub-clause(2), which applied to ministers of religious denominations, should beso altered as to render them liable to perform any prescribed workof a non-combatant character.The proposal was agreed to.The War Cabinet decided To omit the words following &quot; service &quot; in line 10, page 2.Clause 1 (3). IX. The Home Secretary stated that sub-section (3) had been inserted in clause 1. to enable a man to be transferred to the Navyif required.The Second Sea Lord stated that the opinion of the admiralty was that any method of conscripting the Naval Forces would be-  most inadvisable.The War Cabinet decided that Sub-section (3) of clause 1 should be deleted.Obligation of young men toserve in Volunteers.12. With reference to the proposal in section 5 (1) that malesfrom .1T to 18 years of age shall be required to perform service inthe Volunteer Force, it was pointed out that it had been ascertained that there was great objection to this proposal, and that the value ofsuch military service gained by service in the Volunteer Force wouldnot be equal to the loss which would be incurred in the industrial life of the country. It was suggested that it might be useful toorganise a voluntary movement among lads below IS years of age for joining the Volunteers.The War Cabinet decided that This clause should be deleted from the Draft Bill.Power by proclamation towithdrawCertificates of exemption in Bill:- Case of HationalEmergency.13. Sir Auckland Geddes laid before the War Cabinet thefollowing alternative to clause 2, as printed in the Draft Bill: (1.) His Majesty may by Proclamation, declaring that a national emergency has arisen, direct that any certificates of exemption from military service granted or renewed toany class or body of men specified, in the Proclamation,or to men of any class or description so specified, shallas from a date specified in the Proclamation, or if nodate is so specified as from the date on which the proclamation is made, cease to have effect, and allcertificates to which the Proclamation applies shall cease to have effect accordingly.(2.) While any such Proclamation remains in force, no applica-tion shall be entertained for the grant or renewal of anycertificate to which the Proclamation applies or for thegrant or renewal of any certificate to which the Proclama-tion would have applied if the certificate- had been in-existence at the date when the Proclamation took effect.(3.) In this section the expression &quot; certificates of exemption from military service &quot; means any certificates granted or
Section 3.14. Sir Auckland Geddes brought forward the following newsub-section to be added to clause 3 : It is hereby declared that if any question arises in any legal proceedings under the Reserve Forces Acts, 1882 to 1907,or any orders or regulations made thereunder, whether anycertificate of exemption has been withdrawn either underthe Military Service Act, 1918, or this Act, the Court rnayrequire the holder of.the certificate to give evidence on thequestion, and, if satisfactory evidence is not given to ttiecontrary, the certificate shall be deemed to have been sowithdrawn.The War Cabinet decided that The new sub-section should be added to clause 3, as set out above.Power to call upMen for medical examination.15. Sir Auckland Geddes proposed that the following sub-clause, with reference to the power to call up men for medical examination, should be added at the end of section 3 of the DraftBill :-The Director-General of National Service may at any timerequire any person who, by virtue of the Military service acts, 1916 to 1918, or this Act, is deemed to have beentransferred to the reserve, or who, having voluntarilyenlisted, has been so transferred, notwithstanding that heis the holder of a certificate of exemption from militaryservice, or that he is a person in respect of whom anapplication for such certificate has been made, to presenthimself for medical examination or re-examination.The War Cabinet decided To add at the end of section 3 the sub-clause quoted above.Application of theBill (compulsory military Service)to Ireland.The Constitutionof Tribunals inGreat Britain andIreland.16. The War Cabinet proceeded to consider the application^!the Military Service Acts to Ireland, as put forward in the Draft Billin alternative forms.The Chief Secretary for Ireland called the attention of theWar Cabinet to a memorandum which he had written on thissubject (Paper G-.T.-4133). He stated that, in his opinion, ifclause 4, as suggested in the Draft Bill, were applied to Ireland,the result would be disastrous, and that instant rebellion would he[1365-383]crenewed under the Military Service Acts, 1916 to 1918,or this Act, and any certificates of exemption granted orrenewed to men who have voluntarily attested, notwith-standing that such certificates have no statutory force.He pointed out that the power which would be used in the firstinstance would be that which had been given to the Ministry ofNational Service under the Military Service Act, 1918, by which means it wotdd be possible to call up younger men first. He statedthat he would be satisfied with the power given him under section of the Draft Bill. To illustrate the need of such powers, heinstanced the &apos; case of the miners, who had been de-certified, andwho ought to have been reporting this week, but who were nowlodging applications with the Tribtmals for exemption.The War Cabinet agreed to the insertion in the Bill of thealternative clause as set out above.
the inevitable result. Mr. Duke was, however, of opinion that thealternative for clause 4, which gave power by Order in Council toapply the Act to Ireland, could be made operative, provided thatsub-section (2) of this clause remained as part of the Bill. he pointed out that, by means of this sub-clause, it would be possibleto enlist at once some thousands of volunteers who had some military knowledge, and who had arms and leaders, and that, oncetlris opposition was removed, the party which would be most strongly antagonistic to compulsory service in Ireland would disappear. He stated that at the present time the Government was unable to prevent the activities of these volunteers.Considerable discussion took place as to the form of Tribunalswhich it would be most advisable to set up in Ireland, and it was generally agreed, first, that the system of Tribunals now inoperation in Great Britain was inapplicable to Ireland, and, second,that it would be impossible to establish for Ireland a differentsystem of Tribunals from that which existed in Great Britain.Sir Auckland Geddes expressed the opinion that the great danger of making any change in England with regard to theconstitution of Tribunals was that it would involve a break in the flow of men to the Colours, and that if the present system were maintained there would be at least the advantage of no break, but acontinually rising curve in the number of men enlisted. He himself had originally desired the abolition of the Tribunals, and had onlyagreed to their retention for the above reason.The opinion was very strongly expressed that the system of tribunials in England had proved very unsatisfactory, and that ithad been largely due to the Tribunals as they exist at present thatthe flow of men to the Colours was very considerably delayed.The Prime Minister suggested that it would be advisable if theCommittee could meet again that afternoon, in order to come tosome agreement as to a common system of Tribunals which shouldbe set up for Great Britain and for Ireland, observing that, in hisopinion, it was essential that the same rules as regards theconstitution of Tribunals must apply in both countries. He pointedout that the question of the Army and the Navy was a matterentirely for the Imperial Parliament, and would not be within thejurisdiction of any Home Rule Parliament! which might be broughtinto existence.The War Cabinet decided that The alternative for clause 4, as set out in the Draft Bill,applying to Ireland the Bill to make further provision inrespect to servico in His Majesty&apos;s Forces, should be incorporated into the Bill, subject to the setting up of tribunials on similar lines for Great Britain and Ireland ;the latter question to be discussed that afternoon by theCommittee appointed by War Cabinet 377, Minute 11, anda Report laid before the War Cabinet on the following morning.Ireland. 17. In connection with the application of the amendment of- the Military Service Acts to Ireland, the War Cabinet had underCompulsory consideration the question of the introduction in the House ofMilitary service.      Commons of a Home Rule Bill for Ireland.Home Rule. &apos;-&apos;-ue Prime Minister pointed out that the AVar Cabinet was bound to the Irish Convention by the letter written by him toSir Horace Plunkett (G.T.-4139). He urged that, in view of the pledges which had been given on the subject of Home Rule, a Billgranting self-government to Ireland must be introduced at the sametime as the amended Military Service Bill, for, if this were not done,it would be stated, and rightly so, that the pledges given on thissubject, had not been redeemed. He further pointed out that he himself, many of those who at the present time supported the
Government in the House of Commons, and the whole of the LabourParty, could not countenance the introduction of a Bill for compulsory military service in Ireland without at the same timesubmitting to the House of Commons a Home Rule Bill. He wasalso Of opinion, that the United States of America would view withthe greatest disfavour a proposal to apply conscription to Irelandwithout Home Rule.It was generally agreed that it was essential that both measures should be submitted to Parliament at the same time, but Mr. bonar law expressed the opinion that, if there were not substantial agreement in the Report which was to be presented by the IrishConvention,&apos; the War Cabinet would be faced with the gravedifficulty arising out of the pledge given by the Prime Minister toUlster that Ulster should not be coerced.The Prime Minister stated that he had been considering thismatter very carefully, and his inclination was to inform parliament that the Government would undertake to carry through a Bill whichwould represent substantial agreement by the Irish Convention, or,if substantial agreement had not been arrived at, a measure on thelines of the letter which he had written to Sir Horace Plunkett,with the approval of the War Cabinet, for submission to theConvention.The question arose as to whether considerable delay would notensue in the application of the Military Service Act to Ireland if itwere intended to carry through Parliament a measure of Home Rulebefore compulsory service could be applied. The opinion wasexpress- 1 that such a measure could not be passed in all its stagesthrough both Houses of Parliament in much less than five or six weeks, and doubt was expressed as to whether so great a delay wascompatible with military necessities.In view of the possibility that a measure of Home Rule,proposed by the Government, but not based on the substantial agreement of the Irish Convention, might be opposed by all sectionsof Irishmen in the House of Commons, the question was discussedas to whether the Military Service Act could then be applied toIreland. It was agreed that, in this event, the Government would still ask for the approval of Parliament for the application of theAct to Ireland.Mr. Barnes dissented, and stated that he would be no party tothe application of conscription to Ireland unless Home Rule were passed.The War Cabinet deferred the further consideration of thisquestion until the following day.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,April 5, 1918.[1365-383][l\T.O.D
