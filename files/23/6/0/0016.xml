The three cavalry divisions might be regarded as equal to one infantry division.Enemy Attacknear Bethune.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theenemy had begun a heavy bombardment this morning against our1st Army, between Locon and Bethune.

The War CabinetPresident of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries on the subjectof the prices of sulphate of ammonia and superphosphate.Thew ariabinet decided fchat-Mr. Austen Chamberlain should   be asked to examine thisquestion, with full powers to settle it on their behalf.American 9. The War Cabinet  took note of a memorandum by the shipbuilding. Admiralty pointing out the indifferent progress made with merchant ship construction in the United States - Paper G.T.-4252).In regard to the suggestion that a telegram should be sent inno uncertain terms to Lord Reading, asking him to bring the matterof the extreme urgency of shipbuilding before the President person-ally, the War Cabinet felt that it would be advisable to concentrateall efforts with President Wilson on one urgent question at a time.They therefore decided To postpone action hi this matter until effect had been givento the urgent representations already made to PresidentWilson in regard to the shipment of troops from theUnited States.They requested The First Lord to raise the question again shortly
Lord Derby&apos;e 11. The Prime -Minister said that this was Lord Derby&apos;s lastMission in Paris. appearance at the War Cabinet as Secretary of State for War, as hehad accepted an important mission on behalf of the War Cabinet inParis. He hoped, however, that the War Cabinet would often see him in his new role. He pointed out that the British Governmenthad long been represented in Paris by one of our most distin-distinguished and able diplomatists, who had unquestionably renderedthe highest services. At the present time, however, there was notvery much diplomacy required in Paris. Recent experience had shown that what was needed was some representative who was inactive touch with the views of the British Government on theinnumerable questions, mainly of a military character, that werearising from day to day between the two countries. This wasproved by the fact that two members of the War Cabinet had had to visit France within the last fortnight, and that Lord Milner,who was now in Paris, while on his way home had been summonedthither by a special message from the French President of theCouncil. No doubt some of the questions that had occupied thetwo members of the War Cabinet referred to would in any case haverequired their presence in France. Nevertheless, many of thequestions were such as could be dealt with by one, such as lord derby, who had long taken a part in the counsels of the WarCabinet and, consequently, had a knowledge of their views which nodiplomatist could possibly possess. The reasons which hadprompted the despatch of a special political mission to the UnitedStates of America, under Lord Reading, were overwhelminglystronger in the case of France. He and Mr. Balfour, after very full discussion, had come to the conclusion that Lord Derby should beasked to accept this appointment, and, notwithstanding the- inconvenience entailed, Lord Derby had patriotically accepted tnepost. Lord Derby would be Head of the War Mission, with thesame powers as had been accorded to Lord Reading, namely, not to confine his activities to diplomatic matters, but with full powers todiscuss with the French Government, on behalf of the War Cabinet,matters relating to the War.Lord Derby, while recognising that he would have no authority over the Military Council at Versailles, asked that he might beauthorised to keep in the closest touch with the military representatives, and the Prime Minister, on behalf of the WarCabinet, expressed the hope that lie would keep in as close touchas possible. Lord Derby was also authorised to place himself intouch with General Pershing, on behalf of the War Cabinet.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff asked the War Cabinetto consider the possibility of postponing Lord Derby taking up his appointment for a few days, in order that he might visit Italy witha view to inducing the Italian Government to send more divisions tothe Western front.While recognising the importance of obtaining further Italianassistance, the War Cabinet decided that It would be inadvisable for Lord Derby to postpone taking up his appointment at the present critical juncture.Inter-Ally Council 10.   The  War  Cabinet  had  before   them  a   minute  from and Inter-Ally Mr Austen Chamberlain covering a letter from Professor AttolicoExecutives. (Paper G.T.-4247) on the subject of the requirements of the AlliedGovernments.The War Cabinet decided that-Mr. Chamberlain should have authority to arrange a Conferenceon the subject between the Departments concerned,consulting Lord Robert Cecil and Sir -Joseph Maclay as necessary.
The War Cabinet authorised The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, if he should think fit, to send a message on their behalf to Lord Bertie,expressing their high appreciation of the valuable serviceshe had rendered while Ambassador at Paris.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,April 18, 1918.
