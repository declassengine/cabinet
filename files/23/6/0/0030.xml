The western front.German reserves.Allied R CtLa^-TMv1. WITH reference to War Cabinet 404, Minute 2, the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff reported that one more fresh Germandivision had arrived north of Hinges. On the Lys front 40 fresh divisions, and 9 Somme divisions had been engaged, making a totalof 49.A suggestion was made that the Allied reserves had been drawn to the northern and southern wings of that part of the frontwhere a big German attack was anticipated, and that in the centre,just north of the Somme, the reserves had been reduced.The Chief of the Imperial Staff said that this point was beingcarefully watched by General Foch.Disposition of enemy Divisions.GermanCasualties.2. With reference to War Cabinet 401, Minute 4, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff reported that 148 German divisions hadbeen engaged once, 79 a second time, 20 a third time, and 1 a fourth time, making the equivalent of a total of 248 divisionsengaged.3. With reference to War Cabinet 393, Minute 3, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff said that the Director of military intelligence was always unwilling to give figure of enemy casualties.The Germans now publish nothing. The only safe estimate,therefore, that could be made was that punishments were even.German Attackanticipated.4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that there were signs of a coming attack between Arras and Albert ; there were acertain number of new trenches which looked as though they mightbe assembly trenches ; there were more dumps ; more hospitals hadbeen erected ; and more batteries had been located. It was reasonable to suppose that the anticipated attack would be made assoon as the German divisions were refitted and retrained. It mightbegin any day next week, and therefore the indications mentionedabove fitted in with other information already received. It was not unlikely that the attack would be made on a wide front, with,perhaps, 50 German divisions (30 in front and 20 behind). Suchan attack might be on a front of about 30 miles, or 50 kilometres.If the enemy could bring enough weight to bear at one of the pointswhere success had already been achieved,&apos; such as at Amiens or thegroup of hills in the north, it would pay him to do so, but it wouldbe difficult, because in those places the line had been pushed into*&quot; noses,&quot; with exposed flanks and congested roads. It was more likely that the Germans would choose a &quot;flat face &quot; for their attack,where all their weight could be brought to bear. Such a&quot; flat face &quot; could be found between Arras and Albert.Sir Eric Geddes pointed out that, from the transportation pointof view, Doullens, being the junction immediately north of Amiens,was a very important point and very valuable.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff concurred in this, and pointed out that an advance of a few miles would put Doullens underthe enemy guns. The enemy were now about 15 miles fromDoullens.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff further reported thatArras was being heavily shelled.Persia:Despatch of Partyto Tabriz.5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff drew attention to atelegram from Sir C. Marling, dated the 7th May, 1918 (No. 389),which reported that General Dunsterville proposed sending a party of twelve British officers and twelve other ranks by direct route,with packed transport, from Hamadan to Tabriz. They would proceed to Drumia, in order to assist our friends there in organisingresistance against the Turks.  Sir C. Marling had replied to General
Dunsterville that he most earnestly deprecated the despatch of theparty to Tabriz, because he thought that its effect would beprovocative and would give the Turks a pretext to massacreChristians indiscriminately, on the ground that we were organisingthem to attack Mohammedans.Lord Curzon and the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs suggested that this question should be referred to the EasternCommittee.The Secretary of State for War asked that immediate action might be taken, and pointed out that this was a case in whichmilitary and political matters were very closely connected, inasmuch as General Dunsterville was serving uuder General Marshall.While recognising the importance of fixing the limits of thepolitical and military importance of General Dunsterville&apos;s operations,the War Cabinet decided that In view of the close connection of this cpiestion with the manyfacets of Eastern policy with which they were not intimatelyacquainted, the questioned should be examined, in the firstinstance, by the Eastern Committee the same afternoon.The Mexican G. The War Cabinet had before them a note by the Chief situation. Imperial General Staff, covering a memorandum by the GeneralStaff (Paper G.T. 4482) in regard to the Mexican situation. TheChief of Imperial General Staff, in his note, pointed out that theForeign Office telegram to Lord Reading on the 7th May, 1918(No. 2788 i did not, in his opinion, sufficiently emphasise the military aspect of the situation in Mexico, nor the need for immediate action,and he considered that a further telegram should be sent in whichstress might be laid on these points.The War Cabinet decided that This question should be settled by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and the Secretary of State for War.Submarines. 7. The First Sea Lord  reported that the transport  &quot; QueenAlexandra&quot; had collided with a German submarine off Cherbourg;the submarine was sunk, and the &quot;Queen Alexandra&quot; had beenable to undertake her voyage.Eemoval of Stores 8. With reference to War Cabinet 370, Minute 17, the Firstat Vladivostock. Sea Lord reported a message from POLS. &quot;Suffolk,&quot; to the effectthat the Red Army were demanding the right, to remove suchAllied munitions from Vladivostock as were paid for by the lateRussian Government, The Commanding Officer had replied by pointing out the unclesirability of the surrender of any munitions to Bolsbeviks. .Bombing raids . 9. The First Sea Lord reported that bombing raids had beencarried out and bombs dropped on Bruges and Zeebrugge. Hitswith 230-1 b. bombs had been claimed on a cargo ship. An enemymachine was driven down in flames. One of our pilots waswounded.   All our machines returned safelv.Naval said onOstend.10. With reference to War Cabinet 397, Minute 2, the first sea Lord reported that, on the previous night, the operation to close the ports of Ostend and Zeebrugge had been successfully completed at Ostend. The operations had been carried out in much the same manner as on the 22ncl April. The &quot; Vindictive&quot; and the &quot;Sappho&quot;had been prepared as block ships, but, owing to engine trouble, the
&quot; Sappho &quot; had been left behind and was unable to take part in theoperations. The &quot; Vindictive&quot; had got in and had been sunkbetween the wooden -piers and across the entrance to OstendHarbour. Information was still scanty, but it was believed that shewas sunk, not right across the mouth, but at an angle of 30&quot;. our losses were slight. One motor-launch had been les^-aad-one-ooastai.n,&quot;^j3^ea*-hatl--beeti- sunk by orders of the Vice-Admiral, in orderto save her from falling into the hands of the enemy. One Com-mander, one Lieutenant, and one Sub-Lieutenant were reportedkilled, while two or three officers and twelve men were reported missing.The Prime Minister said that this was another admirableoperation, and that the Admiralty and all concerned were to becongratulated ; in particular, he thought that the time had come,now that this last success at Ostend completed the operations begunon 22nd April, for the message of congratulation to Admiral Keyes,which had been deferred (War Cabinet 397, Minute 2), to be sent.The War Cabinet decided that A telegram of congratulation, in the name of the War Cabinet,should be sent by the First Lord of the Admiralty to Vice-Admiral Sir Roger Keyes.Ireland.11. The Prime Minister stated that he considered it highly desirable, in view of the vast amount of work in connection withthe War that required the constant attention of the members of theWar Cabinet, that the Secretary of State for the Colonies should be requested to act on their behalf with regard to Irish affairs ingeneral, only bringing before the War Cabinet such questions -asmay be referred to him by the Lord-Lieutenant through theChief Secretary for Ireland-as Mr. Long thought that body should consider before action is taken.The Secretary of State for the Colonies stated that he could not accept the responsibility, proposed to be cast upon him, of acting for the War Cabinet, unless it was clearly understood that the mostdrastic steps should be taken to stamp out pro-Gei-man intrigues.The War Cabinet approved the proposal of the Prime Minister,and accepted the condition made by Mr. Long.Supply of Flourfor Dog Biscuits.12. With reference to the memorandum by the Ministry ofFood on the supply of flour for dog biscuits (Paper G.T.-4415), theWar Cabinet were informed that general agreement had been,reached on the subject by the Departments concerned, and that theWheat Commission had undertaken to issue 5,000 tons of flour overa period of six months.Representation ofthe People Bill:ProportionalBepresentation.13. AVith reference to \Arar Cabinet 339, Minute 3, the WarCabinet had under consideration a Note by Lord Curzon on theProportional Representation Scheme (Paper G.T.-4476).Lord Curzon pointed out that there was considerable difficultyover this scheme. In the House of Lords there had been a large majority in favour of proportional representation, which proposal had been several times rejected in the House of Commons. On thelast day when the proposal was discussed in the House of Lords,Lord Curzon said that the House asked for assurances about thisscheme before it was prepared to give its consent and pass the representation of the People Bill, and that he was called on several times to answer questions from those who were in favour of proportional representation.- The five answers which he gave werepracticalfy on the same lines as those given by the Home secretary in the House of Commons. Both he and Sir George Cave promised that, if the House of Lords would pass the Bill, a Committee should
Emigration Bill. M The War cabinet had under consideration the draft of the emigration Bill (Paper G.T.-4061 a), and a memorandum on thesubject of the BiU from the Secretary of State for the Colonies (paper g.T.-4061).The War Cabinet approved the draft of the Bill.2, Whitehall Gardens, S W.,May 10, 1918.be set up which would draw up an experimental scheme, and that,when the Report of this Committee was issued, the opinion of theHouse of Commons would be taken on the scheme as a whole. Ifthe House of Commons decided in favour of the scheme, then theGovernment promised to put a Minister in charge of the Bill, andwould take the same responsibility for the Bill as fit had in the caseof the Representation of the People Act.Lord Curzon said that it might be argued, from certain wordsthat he had used in the House of Lords, that the Government wouldtake a decision irrespective of the opinion of the House of Commons,but the general sense of his various statements was clear and in accord with what the Home Secretary had said in the House ofCommons. He was of opinion that it was very important the/&apos;the War Cabinet should come to a definite decision in order to meetthe various questions that might arise.Mr. Bonar Law said that the real position was that arrangements had been made to have the whole proposal examined in the amemanner as the Report of the Speaker&apos;s Conference. This first stage of the proceedings, as regards these proposals, was to be left entirelyopen to the free vote of the House. If the House of Commonsdecided in favour, then the Government had promised to take chargeof the proposals, and Sir George Cave said that an arrangement hadbeen come to for the scheme to be introduced on Monday byMr. H. A. L. Fisher (but not in his capacity as a member of theGovernment), who was in favour of the proposals, and that he understood that an amendment was to be moved by Mr. Burdett-Coutts.It was generally agreed that the statement of Lord Curzon inthe House of Lords on the 6th February, as follows :  &quot;The Government will submit the Report to the House ofCommons as a whole. The House of Commons musthave the right to determine whether the Report as awhole shall or shall not be adopted as the basis of discussed-cussion .... and, if the House of Commons thought it right and proper to express their assent to the scheme asa whole, 1 think we might fairly assume that it was agood and reasonable scheme, which it was generallydesired should pursue its further stages towards theStatute Book. In that case the Government would undertake to put a Minister in charge of the measure,and he would use his best efforts to secure the passageof a good and reasonable measure into law.&quot;expressed the extent of the Governments pledges on this question.The War Cabinet decided that In the debate which was to take place in the House of Com-mons on this scheme on Monday next the Governmentwould stand neutral. Individual Ministers would speakand vote as they pleased, and the House should be left togive a free vote on this question.
