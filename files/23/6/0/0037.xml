2. The question was raised as to whether the supply of barbed wire was adequate for our requirements.Sir Eric Geddes stated that, during a recent visit to theWestern front, several Generals had expressed the view to him thatthere was a shortage of wire. The Admiralty had now accepted acertain and limited responsibility for the supply of barbed wire tothe Army which he had recently set out in a letter to the Secretaryof State for War. The maximum output in this country had been increased from 800 tons to 1,100 or 1,200 tons a week, and it wouldtake, he was told, five to six months to lay down additional plantsto increase the output above that figure. The resources in thisrespect of the United States were ample.Lord Milner remarked that orders had been given by the WarOffice to obtain all that was possible from the United States, andthat he understood that some 5,000 tons were now en route.Sir Eric Geddes added that he understood that 11,000 tons hadbeen supplied from this country to France since the 21st March.Lord Milner stated that it Avas now fully realised that thesupply of wire was inadequate to meet the demands which were now being made, but that everything possible was being done tomeet requirements.*3. Attention was drawn to the last report from the GeneralOfficer Commanding at Salonica, a portion of which indicated thatthe sick rate had considerably increased.Lord Milner informed the War Cabinet that he was making enquiries into this matter with a view to remedying as far aspossible the conditions that prevailed.Submarines. 4. The First Sea Lord stated that -(a.) The Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean reportedthat a French trawler destroyed an enemy submarine,believed to be the &quot;DO 35,&quot; off the coast of Sardinia,thirty of the crew being rescued.(6.) A force of four destroyers attacked an enemy submarine inthe vicinity of the &quot; Galloper &quot; light-vessel, many depth charges being dropped and one of the vesseFs paravaneexploded. It is considered that the submarine was sunk.(c.) An airship and United States destroyers attacked a sub-marine in the St. George&apos;s Channel, with possiblysuccessful results.Supply of barbed wire.Salonica:Sick Bate.* Sir Eric Geddes subsequently put in a copy of his letter to Lord Milner(Paper G.T. 4638),The Western 1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that heFront. nad nothing to report as regards the Western front.   In reply to aquestion as to what would be the best policy for the Germans toadopt, he remarked that he thought that it would be more advantageous for the Germans to wait, say, another ten days, so asto get the maximum number of their divisions available, and toattack the British on a &quot; flat face.&quot; General Wilson added that hehad seen General Foch, who was very confident and held the viewthat every day the offensive was deferred was a day in our favour,and that he was generally satisfied with the digging and wiringthat was taking place.
oOH.M.S. - Phoenix.&quot; 5. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that H.M.S.&quot; Phoenix &quot; had been torpedoed in the vicinity of Valona Bay, andhad afterwards capsized and sunk, the casualties being two killed and three wounded.Bruges. 6. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that airreconnaissances indicated that there were twenty-four destroyers ortorpedo-boats and twelve submarines locked up in the Bruges Locks.The view was now held that the Bruges-Ostend canal containedless water than had previously been thought, and consequently,although Ostend Harbour was now partially clear, that port couldnot be used for the ingress and egress of destroyers and submarinesnow at Zeebrugge. Admiral Wemyss stated that the navy were nowbombing the enemy craft in the Zeebrugge canal, and were nego-tiating with the Air Ministry for the return of some squadrons thatwrere lent to them some time ago. His view was that the opportunityfor bombing these craft under such favourable conditions might notoccur again, and it w*as therefore highly desirable that as large an air force as possible should be used forthwith for this purpose.Zeebrugge.7. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that during a recent bombardment of Zeebrugge, an enemy destroyer was hit andhad sunk in the fairway between the &quot; Thetis &quot; and the block-ships.Air Paid onCattaro.8. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that four british machines had raided Cattaro. The attack was a completesurprise, and direct hits had been obtained on the submarine head-quarters, which were seen to be on fire in two places, and on the barracks and in the arsenal buildings. All our machines had returned.Admiralissimo 9. Sir  Eric  Geddes  informed  the   War  Cabinet  that,  infor the accordance with the Prime mini steps instructions, he had corn-Mediterranean, municated with M. Clemenceau with regard to the command of theMediterranean and Adriatic, and it had been arranged that, if theFrench and the Italians were unable to agree as to the command ofthe combined French and Italian force, we should suggest a british admiral as Admiralissimo.M. Clemenceau had stated that, if the Italians refused to agreeto the French proposals, he would agree to a British Admiral beingdetailed in the first place to co-ordinate the Allied naval forces inthe Mediterranean, and that such Admiral should, at a later date,pass from that of Co-coordinator to Commander of the Allied naval forces. The Italians had been asked to reply within four days, but,as no answer had yet been received, M. Clemenceau had wired to rome asking the Italians to expedite their reply, and he will let usknow the result. Admiral Sims had been approached as regardsUnited States vessels in the Mediterranean, and the Japanese would undoubtedly agree to their vessels being placed under British com-mand. The First Lord of the Admiralty was of opinion that theappointment of a British Admiralissimo would result in a bettercontrol being maintained over the Allied forces, if such were workedjudiciously, and it would also be of assistance in dealing with thesubmarine menace in the Mediterranean ; further, that we should get a correct disposition of the forces in those waters, and be ableto make more use of the light cruisers and small craft of our Allies.There were certain minor difficulties to be surmounted, but he didnot think they were insuperable.
Next Meeting of 10. With reference to War Cabinet 410, Minute 14, Mr. Bonarthe Supreme War Law informed the War Cabinet that M. Clemenceau was averse toCouncil. any postponement of the date of the next meeting of the supreme war Council, even in order to enable Colonel House to attend.The War Cabinet therefore decided that If no reply was received from Colonel House by to-day, atelegram should be sent to M. Clemenceau notifying him of the Prime Ministers agreement that the meeting shouldbe held at Versailles on the 1st June next, and that one ofthe items to be placed on the agenda should be the appoint-ment of an Admiralissimo in the Mediterranean, if thismatter had not been settled prior to that date. Theresponsibility of drafting the telegram was left to theSecretary.Exchange of 11. With reference to  War Cabinet  405,  Minute  10,   the prisoners of War. question of the exchange of prisoners of war and their treatmentwas considered by the War Cabinet, and the view was held that,now that the French had entered into an agreement with theGermans for the exchange of their prisoners of war, the situation was completely altered, and it was impossible for us to do other-wise than to go the same lengths as regards the exchange of our prisoners ; further, that it was highly desirable that, when Parliamentmet, a statement should be made that we had taken steps to open upnegotiations in this matter with the German Government.Sir Eric Geddes pointed out that the naval position was unlike the army position as, although the number of naval prisoners wassmall, any general exchange of such would be of great advantage to the Germans out of all proportion to the numbers involved froma military point of view, as we had a considerable number of skilledGerman naval ratings who had been captured from submarines,and that the German submarine activity was being greatly curtailedby their lack of skilled crews for such vessels. He was going intothe question as to whether we could effect any exchange, man forman, without releasing these skilled ratings.As regards the question of the bad treatment &quot;of our prisonersof war, relative to which a number of reports were now current, itwas advanced that the question of treatment would have to beconsidered apart from the question of exchange, but that any attackon the treatment would be mitigated if it were known that thequestion of exchange was under consideration.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) Without going into any questions of detail, Lord Newtonshould initiate a communication, through the netherlands government, asking if the German Government wouldbe prepared to discuss and enter into some agreement for the exchange of prisoners of war.(b.) Lord Newton should attend an early meeting of the WarCabinet to explain the situation in regard to prisonersof War.Situation at 12. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandumMurmansk. by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (Paper G.T.-4589) and atelegram from the Admiralty to the Rear-Admiral at Murmansk(Paper G.T.-4596) with regard to the situation in the Murmanprovince.
Lord Milner thought it undesirable at the present moment todiscuss with the United States the proposed despatch Of an Americanbrigade to Murmansk, and mentioned that, in the meantime, acldi-tionai Royal Marines were being sent to Murmansk, and that sometroops would shortly follow. He recommended that the War cabinet should approve the policy under which we used any force that canbe got together in that region. He added that there was a small number of Serbs in the vicinity, who might be used, and that he hadreceived information from M. Clemenceau that the latter agreed tothe use of Czecho-Slovak troops at Murmansk and Archangel, exceptsuch as had already arrived at Vladivostock.Sir Eric Geddes drew the attention of the War Cabinet to two telegrams that had been received from the Hear-Admiral at Murmansk,in one of which it was stated that M. Chichirin had informed thelocal Soviet there that Allied military reinforcements were expected,and that, unless such had received visas from the Russian Represen-tatives abroad, the troops were not to be allowed to land.In this connection it was felt that such orders might be only ofthe nature of &quot; camouflage,&apos;&apos; in view of German pressure on theRussians to prevent our sending troops there, and that no noticecould be taken of such restrictions. The second telegram gaveRear-Admiral Kemp&apos;s proposals as to the command of all the forceslanded, and he had suggested that General Poole should be placedin supreme command of all naval ratings disembarked, and at thesame time be given political control.Sir Eric Geddes stated that the Admiralty instructions to admiral Kemp were that he was to-operate in every way possible with General Poole, and they approved of all naval ratings landedbeing placed entirely under General Poole&apos;s orders while on shore.(a.) The War Cabinet approved the proposals set out in thepaper by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff(G.T.-4589),but decided that The question of American participation in the expedition shouldnot lie dealt with until the Secretary of State for Warand the Secretary of Slate for Foreign Affairs might think desirable.(6.) The War Cabinet further approved the proposal thatGeneral Poole should be placed in command of theRoyal Marines and naval ratings that might be landed.Finnish RedGuards. 13. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to ForeignOffice telegram No. 920 to the British Minister at Stockholm, andthe reply, No. 1389, relative to the use of a number of Finnish RedGuards in support of the Allied troops at Murmansk and Archangel.The latter telegram indicated that the British officials at Stockholmwere strongly opposed to the use of these Red Guards for stich a purpose.Lord Milner considered it essential that it should be left toGeneral Poole to do the best he can with any force that he might beable to obtain. Whilst he was not averse to General Poole being-made aware of the objections that had been raised to the use of theFinnish Red Guards, it must, he urged, be left to him to decide asto whether he would use them or not.The War Cabinet requested Lord Robert Cecil to draft a telegram relative to the Finnish RedGuards, and to forward the same to the Secretary of Statefor War for his consideration d transmission to GeneralPoole.
Food Production in 14. With, reference to War Cabinet 412, Minute 15,. the War1919* Cabinet had before them the following documents : Memorandum by Mr. Prothero (Paper G.T.-44Q9),Memorandum by the Food Controller (Paper G.T.-4499),Memorandum bv Mr. Prothero, covering a report by Sir ArthurLee (Paper G.T.-4599).Mr. Prothero explained that the Food Production department had prepared a programme for the further extension, during thenext twelve months, of the arable acreage of England and Wales,but, in view of the new situation, created by the transfer ofagricultural labour to the army, which had recently been agreed to(War Cabinet 409, Minute 7), it did not now seem possible toproceed with the contemplated extension. This was very regrettable,,as, for the increased programme, the additional men required wouldhave been only 3,500 skilled ploughmen in September 1918, 3,500in February 1919, and 15,000 unskilled men. The efforts of theDepartment to increase home-grown supplies of corn had met withso much success that the proportion of land now under tillage wasnot far short of that of the seventies of last century, and, if theresults already achieved were to be maintained, legislation wouldbe necessary. The land could not go on yielding under its present-strain without their being relief land to rest the existing cornland.Legislation was required to maintain the present output. Land-owners had accepted the Corn Production Act on the understandingthat the compulsory powers now exercised by the Board of Agri-culture under the Defence of the Realm Regulations should ceaseon the 20th August, 1918, and that the Corn Production Act should then come into operation. It would be necessary to ask Parliamentto postpone the operation of Part IV. of the Corn Production Actfor another year. Unless this were done the Board would be unableto retain possession after the 21st Aiagust next of any of the land which had been taken over, either because it was badly farmed or because it was required for allotment purposes He advised theintroduction of a short Bill to amend the Corn Production Act.Lord Milner said that, in view of the man-power situation, he feared that it would not be possible at present to do more thanmaintain the remarkable level reached in 1918. Even that couldonly be done with the help of the Minister of National Service. Bythe agreement reported to the War Cabinet on&quot; the 11th May, theBoard, of Agriculture had undertaken to release 30,000 Grade men, and an effort is to be made to replace these partly by prisonersof war say 10,000 and partly by men raised by the Minister ofNational Service. He was in favour of postponing for a year theoperation of the Corn Production Act, as asked for by Mr. Prothero.Pie would not shut, out the possibility of undertaking some or all ofthe larger programme.Major Lloyd Greame stated that the Minister of NationalService was arranging to recruit as agricultural volunteers menfrom 45 to 50, who should be exempt from military service, but itwas not possible to predicate how many would be forthcoming.Lord Curzon feared there would be some opposition in thePlouse of Lords to the continuation for another year of the powers under the Defence of the Realm Regulations, and he thought theWar Cabinet should have the views of Mr. Long on the attitude oflandowners towards the matter.Mr. Prothero thought that any probable opposition could bedealt with by explaining, when the Bill was being introduced, the limited operations contemplated under it by the Boards of Agricul-ture, viz., compulsory powers to plough up, say, 250,000 acres ofgrassland, and to remain in occupation of the land already occupied.Originally he had asked for powers to plough up 700,000 acres, andhe would prefer not to be limited to any definite figure.
WC 415Man-Power:Mobility ofMunitions Labour.The War Cabinet decided (o ask Mr. Prothero to submit a draft Bill, with a covering noteindicating the extent to which it was desired to exercisecompulsory powers ;and instructed The Secretary to bring the matter before the War Cabinet ona day next week when Mr. Long could be present.15. With reference to War Cabinet 398, Minute 13, the WarCabinet had before them details of the arrangements for theextension of the War Munitions Volunteer scheme, prepared bythe Ministry of Munitions after consultation with representativeemployers and trade unionists, the Ministry of Labour, and theMinistry of National Service.Sir Robert Home said ho had been requested to expressLord Pirrie&apos;s view that the application of the scheme to any yards and shops under his control was certain to create great disturbanceamong the shipyard employees and men in the engineering shops,and he objected very strongly to this being done. Sir Robert Homefurther explained that the Admiralty had not been consulted before these proposals were brought to the Cabinet, and that they involved a very serious policy in the way of applying great pressure to mento compel them to become AVar Munition Volunteers. TheAdmiralty were opposed to this being done in the yards and shopsover which they had jurisdiction.Mr. Churchill pointed out that the principle set forth in his paper (G.T.-4577) had been approved by the &quot;War Cabinet, and itwould lead to serious administrative difficulties if the policy laiddown was to be applied by one Department and not by another.It would be impossible for the Ministry of Munitions tocontinue releasing men for the army and to maintain the output ofmunitions unless they were free to make the best use of the labour available by means of mobilisation and dilution. He believed that,in the long run, the Admiralty would not lose in output by adopting the policy of dilution, provided it were done gradually andsystematically.Sir Stephenson Kent doubted whether the Munitions Volunteerscheme could be made at ail effective without the full co-operationof the Admiralty.Major Lloyd Greame agreed that it would lead to an impossibleindustrial situation if the two Departments pursued differentpolicies.Sir Robert Horne objected to the assumption that the policy ofthe Admiralty in regard to dilution differed from that of the otherDepartments. The absence of repetition work in many branches ofthe Admiralty precluded the widespread adoption of dilution possibleto other Departments. He agreed that a great deal could be doneby setting up a general system which would bring together all theleading Departments for the purpose of dealing with mobile labour,and the Admiralty were prepared to do all that was possible inthat direction with a view to releasing as many men as possible forthe army.. The War Cabinet approved the procedure set forth by theMinister of Munitions in Paper G.T.-4577, as regards shopsunder the Ministry of Munitions.Mr. Churchill undertook not to initiate the procedure for somedays, inasmuch as General Smuts was considering thegeneral question of the supply and regulation of the ship-yard labour in accordance with War Cabinet 411,Minute 2.
Organisation ofGovernmentOffices.16. With reference to War Cabinet 387, Minute 7, the War-Cabinet had before them an Interim Report of a Committee appointedto enquire into the organisation and staffing of Government Offices(Paper G.T.-4387).The Committee recommended-(i.) That, save in certain-exceptional cases, where very largestaffs have to be collected as a matter of extreme urgency,the recruitment of the standard classes of clerks andtypists for all London Departments should be centralisedin the hands of the Civil Service Commission.(ii.) That to make their machinery adequate for this purpose,the Civil Service Commission (a) should open a specialoffice iri their present premises ; (6) take further stepsto secure candidates from all available sources ; (c) extend the personnel of their Selection Boards ; and (d) improve the method of selection by the institution of suitable testexaminations or otherwise.(iii.) That in the exceptional cases where very large staffs arerequired in an emergency,-independent recruiting shouldcontinue subject to the strict observance of the rulesstated in paragraph 14 of the Interim Report.(iv.; That the Civil Service Commission should continue tosupply Higher Grade Women Clerks, but that it shouldbe open to Departments to nominate the applicants whom they desire to appoint to such posts for the approval ofthe Commission.The War Cabinet approved the Report.Man-Power:Military service acts, 1916-1918.17. With reference to War Cabinet 402, Minute 15, the WarCabinet took note of the Proclamation prepared by.the Minister ofNational Service for calling up men born in the vears 1870 and 1871(Paper G.T.-4607).Inter-Ally Counciland Inter-AllyExecutives.IS. With reference to War Cabinet 394, Minute 10, the WarCabinet had before them a Report by Mr. Chamberlain (paper g.T.-4559), recommending that Inter-Allied Programme Com-mittees should be created, composed of experts, who should examinethe resources and programmes of the Allies as regards all classes of imported commodities.The War Cabinet approved the recommendations contained in mr. Chamberlain&apos;s Report, and decided that His Majesty&apos;s Government should be represented upon each ofthe Programme Committees, and that the proper Depart-ments of the British Government should co-operate withthe representatives of the French, American, and italian governments in carrying the plan into effect, utilising,so far as practicable, existing organisations.(Initialled)A.
