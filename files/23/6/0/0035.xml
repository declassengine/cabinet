With reference to AVar Cabinet 409, Minute 1, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff reported that there were now availablefor a fresh attack 17 German divisions which had been out of theline for a month, 13 fresh divisions which had never been used, and18 other fresh divisions, making a total of 48 fresh or refreshedGerman divisions. The total number of enemy divisions on theWestern front was now 208.Allied Reserves. 3. AVith reference to AVar Cabinet 408, Minute 1, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff, questioned as to the number of Frenchand British divisions now ih reserve on the Western front, said thatin the battle area there were about twenty-three divisions, but, ofcourse, there were a number of divisions further south which wereavailable for roulement.Russia. 4. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff said that he had receiveda report from Kirkeness which stated that, on the evening of the I4thMay, an encounter took place between a British force and the FinnishWhite Guards, somewhere between Petchenga an Tullevej, which resulted in a loss for the Finns of 50 killed and about 100 wounded,whilst our casualties were very slight. The report further statedthat the Finns were now in full flight southward, and that theBritish were reported to be as far south as Salmijarbz. AdmiralFremantle said that the troops engaged in this encounter wereRoyal Marines, and that reports had been received at the Admiraltythat one captain of Marines and one private had been wounded. Itwas very important to protect Petchenga. There was already alarge cruiser there, which could, if necessary, land 300 men, and theAdmiralty were sending a reinforcement, which would leave Englandon Monday morning next, consisting of 350 Royal Marines, which included one company of infantry and some artillery.The Prime Minister pointed out that it was very important thatthis information should be sent to Mr. Lockhart.The Secretary undertook to communicate with the ForeignOffice on the subject.. Admiral Fremautle said that the Admiralty would telegraph to admiral Kemp, instructing him to send more detailed informationupon the subject of this encounter.H.M.S. &quot; Wey- 5. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff reported that the mouth.&quot; Commodore of the Adriatic British Squadron had been obliged to postpone the docking of H.M.S. &quot; Weymouth,&quot; as the ship had 211cases of influenza on board. There was apparently an epidemic ofinfluenza not only in this squadron, but also at several naval bases.Admiral Fremantle stated, however, that the attack only lastedabout six daj^s.
Bombiner Raids.The Naval Raid onZeebrugge.The Naval Baid onOstend.Austrian Dread-nought Torpedoed.Life of parliament and Preparation ofNew register.7. With reference to War Cabinet 412, Minute 11, the deputy chief of the Naval Staff said that he did not think that anysubmarines had yet passed down the canal from Bruges toZeebrugge and that aircraft still reported congestion of submarines and destrovers at Bruges.8. With reference to War Cabinet 412, Minute 12, the deputy chief of the Naval Staff reported that at Ostend the Germans had had some success in clearing the channel, having let water throughwith a rush, aud slewed the &apos;; Vindictive &quot; round, so that theobstruction she now afforded was only that of her own breadth.9. Questioned as to whether any information had been received at the Admiralty with reference to the report of the torpedoing ofan Austrian Dreadnought at Pola on the 14th May by the Italians,the Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff said that the only information received at the Admiralty was from the Naval Attache at Rome,repeating the report wdfich had been published by the Italians.Admiral Fremantle said that the First Sea Ford had already sent acongratulatory message to the Italian Chief of the Naval Staff.10. With reference to War Cabinet 41 i, Minute 24, the WarCabinet had under consideration a memorandum hy the Presidentof the Local Government Board with reference to the Life ofParliament and the Preparation of the New Register (paper g.T.-4549).The President of the Local Government Board said that his memorandum raised the question of the post-cards which were to besent out by the War Office to serving soldiers. Mr. Playes Fishersaid that he had relied upon the War Office to send out between4,000,000 and 5,000,000 post-cards, and that he had hoped that theywould have gone out six weeks ago, but that they had not yet gone.He understood that the Adjutant-General had now given leave forthem to be sent. Mr. Hayes Fisher pointed out that these post-cards, when returned, would be of the greatest assistance to registration Officers, and that if they were not returned withina month he was afraid that the Register, as regards soldiers, wouldhe very incomplete. Under the circumstances he proposed that thedate of the publication of the Lists of Voters, which was fixed by-Order in Council made under the Representation of the People Actfor 15th June, should be postponed by Order in Council until29th dune. The Cabinet need not at present contemplate the alteration of the date of the ptiblication of the Register, which was1st October. At the end of July, it would be perfectly possible to review the whole circumstances and prospects, and then, if occasiondemanded, alter the date for the bringing of the Register into force from 1st October to either 1st November or 1st December. Tomake the lists as complete as possible, Mr. Playes Fisher said that hehad come to the conclusion that it Avas necessary to use localcanvassers for this work in the evenings, but that these canvassersmust receive adequate remuneration, and he was therefore asking the Cabinet to authorise the necessary expenditure.  He would point6. The Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff reported that Brugesand Ostend Docks were &quot;bombed on the night of 15th-16th May.On Bruges Dock 5 550-lb. bombs and 40 112-lb. bombs were dropped. A direct hit was made on a ship alongside the SouthQuay of Bruges Docks, causing a large fire and clouds of smoke.At Zeebrugge, three destroyers were observed alongside the mole,and eight barges at the entrance of the Zeebrugge-Bruges Canal.12 230-lb. bombs were dropped, in order to impede salvageoperations.
out, at the same time, that this expenditure would continue only lorabout six weeks.The Prime Minister suggested that if it were found that manysoldiers, owing to the non-return of sufficient information whichcould be obtained from the post-cards, had been left off the list, thepossibility of the issue of a supplementary or emergency list forsoldiers might be contemplated at a later elate.Mr. Hayes Fisher said that this would be difficult, and that he hoped to keep to the dates as fixed by the Order in Council issued under the Act ; but, at the same time, it was possible, and, in hisopinion, would be desirable if it were found that the situationdemanded it.The Prime Minister said that the most important question was how the soldiers were to be able to vote. He called attention to themanner in which the Canadian elections had been carried out at thefront, when the voters were asked to register their vote either for a coalition Government candidate or for the Opposition, which wassplit up into various groups. Mr. Lloyd George suggested that itwould be desirable if the President of the Local Government board would prepare a memorandum on the opportunities and, methods for sailors and soldiers recording their votes, keeping in mind themethod employed at the Canadian Elections.Mr. Hayes Fisher said that another question which must besettled soon was the issue of the Order in Council settling the proxyareas for voting. He pointed out that the House of Commons, whilststrongly protesting against proxy voting in France, had agreed thatit was the only form of voting possible for troops in distant theatres of operations.Lord Curzon said that the life of Parliament ended on the31st July, according to the terms of the last Bill passed for the prolongation of the life of Parliament, and that, while the house would undoubtedly be willing to pass another Bill to prolongParliament, yet it was necessary to see that the new Register was ready by the date to which the life of Parliament was extended byany new Bill.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Secretary of State for AVar should despatch the registration post-cards to the troops serving at home andabroad as soon, as possible.!.6.) The President of the Local Government Board shouldhave authority for the expenditure of the necessarymoney for the remuneration of local canvassers.(c.) Authority should be given to the President of the LocalGovernment Board to issue an Order in Council altering the date for the publication of the new Register from the15th to the 29th June.((?.) The President of the Local Government Board should prepare a memorandum on the electoral position ofsailors and soldiers, under the Representation of thePeople Act, for the consideration of the War Cabinet.Economic Offensive 11. The AVar Cabinet had before them a note by the SecretaryCommittee. (Paper G.T. 4556), in which he stated that Mr. Austen Chamberlainhad requested that the AVar Cabinet should authorise Mr. Barnesand himself to reorganise the Economic Offensive Committee as aCommittee of Economic Defence and Development, in accordancewith the proposal made in Sir Edward Oarsou&apos;s Report (paper g.-.190).Mr. Chamberlain explained that he was not asking the Cabinetto approve of any new departure in policy with regard to theEconomic Offensive Committee ; all he desired was to reorganisethe Committee on the lines suggested by Sir Edward Carson, inorder that the Committee might present a wider and less aggressive

He stated that he was going into the question as to whethera statement could be made on the Governments economic offensivepolicy.   He had, in fact, prepared a sketch of such a statement.Mr. Bonar Law said, that he was afraid that both the Board ofTrade and Mr. &quot;Long had interpreted his recent statement in theHouse on this subject as meaning that the Government haddefinitely decided to denounce commercial treaties. This was notthe intention, and he hoped that Mr. Chamberlain would be able toset this matter right without the necessity of any special explanationin Parliament,The War Cabinet approved Mr. Chamberlains proposal, and suggested that he should communicate with Mr. Long,Lord Robert (Jecil,Dr. Addison,Sir A. Steel-Maitland, and.Sir Albert Stanley,with a view to their co-operation.12. The War Cabinet discussed at some length the question of using Czecho-Slovak troops, now at Vladivostock, as a nucleus of a force on which to base Allied intervention.Lord Milner explained that General Poole was leaving that day with a Military Mission for Archangel and Murmansk with a view toorganising such Czecho-Slovak forces as might be sent to north russia, as well as any others that might volunteer for the defence ofthat district.The Prime Minister stated that, if we were unable to obtain the assent of the United States of America and Japan to intervention,the to whether we should not proceed without them. In his opinion, the matter should be reviewed from a military point of view. The Germans were withdrawing troops from theRussian front, our Army was bearing the brunt, and no materialAmerican contribution had yet arrived to assist us. He thereforewas of opinion that we had every justification for not allowing the americans and the Japanese to block any attempts on our part tostultify these German withdrawals. If the Czecho-Slovak forcepossessed such good fighting qualities as had been reported, andif it was properly officered, there was the possibility, subject to military considerations, that they could be used in Siberia. Theforce, of course, could not be used alone, and it would be necessaryto add Allied contingents. These contingents, however, includingrailwaymen from Canada, need not be of great numerical strength.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he thoughtthat the Japanese would not consent to an enterprise into Siberiabeing undertaken without their taking a leading part. He thoughtthat if we proposed to act without them, it would force their handand they would immediately wish to join ; and, once the Japanesejoined the Expedition, he did not think American co-operation wouldbe long withheld.Lord Curzon stated that, on the previous evening, he had seen the Japanese Ambassador, who had told him that public opinion in japan was very much divided on this question, and in any case itwas necessary to obtain the consent of the United States of America,in view of the financial and material considerations involved.Mr. Balfour suggested that a telegram should be sent to lord reading on the subject, saying that we had a large force of 70,000Czecho-Slovaks who would fight well if property officered, and asking whether the United States Government saw any objection tothese troops being used against the Germans, with the assistance ofthe Japanese.Lord Milner said that he doubted whether the scheme wouldAvork. In the first place, the French Avere very keen that the czecho-Slovak force should be transported to France, and he had
Ghad a telegram from M. Clemeiiceau on the subject that morning.In the second place, all our information tended to show that the czecho-Slovaks themselves were unwilling to he involved in theinternal strife of Russia. Their desire was to fight Germans, andnot Bolsheviks.Mr. Bonar Law pointed out, in this connection, that if the czecho-Slovak force formed part of the Allied force, thus making itclear to them that they were not fighting the Russians but theGermans, it was likely that they would not object to co-operate on Russian soil.It was pointed out that it was difficult to find the necessarytonnage to bring the Czecho-Slovak troops to France. We had told the French that we could not get sufficient ships at themoment for this purpose, and had suggested that it would bebetter to use these troops in an Allied Expedition into Siberia. Theremainder of the Czecho-Slovak force, which had not yet arrived at vladivostock, which, it now appeared, amounted approximately to50,000 out of a total of 70,000, might go to Archangel, and suchnumbers as were not required for the protection of that port and ofMurmansk, could be shipped to France.Lord Milner said that M. Clemenceau had demurred to thissuggestion, as only very reduced numbers could he shipped fromArchangel.Lord Robert Cecil said that he was much impressed by thePrime MinisteFs suggestion. He thought that once we had takendefinite steps in regard to intervention in Siberia, the rest of theAllies would soon conform. The French Government had alwaysbeen pressing for intervention in Siberia, and he thought that ifthey realised we meant business they would consent to the Czecho-Slovaks being used for the purpose.Lord Milner pointed out that as the Czecho-Slovak force was entirely the creation of the French, it was imperative that weshould obtain their co-operation before employing such force, and added that, as far as American feeling was concerned, and its effecton reinforcements for the Western front, he would prefer to have10,000 Americans in Siberia than in France.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The General Staff should ascertain whether anythingeffective could be done in Siberia without the co-opera-tion of the United States of America, using as a nucleusthe Czecho-Slovak force, reinforced, perhaps, with canadian railway elements, British troops from HongKong, and a French contingent, and with or withoutJapanese co-operation.(6.) Lord Robert Cecil should see M. Benish, and ascertaindefinitely whether the Czecho-Slovaks were willing tobe used for this purpose, if it was explained to them thatthe object of the expedition was to fight Germans.fc.) If, after the above action has been taken, there was anypromise of a scheme being put into operation, the ForeignOffice should take such diplomatic action as might be expedient with the United States of America, Japan, andFrance.British Represen- 13. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that hetative in Russia. had appointed Mr. Lindiey as British representative in Russia, andthat, as regards his relations with General Poole, the latter had beengiven authority to report direct to the War Office, sending a copy ofsuch reports in each case to Mr. Lindiey for his information.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 17, 1918.
