1. With reference to&quot; War Cabinet 416, Minute 1, the Secretary-informed the War Cabinet that he had received a telephoniccommunication from the Prime Minister, to the effect that Mr. LloydGeorge desired, if possible, to insert in the statement in regard tothe Irish arrests some words which would connect with the Germandesigns in Ireland persons who had been detained, other thande Valera. Mr. Lloyd George had pointed out that the speechesof de Valera, quoted in the statement, identified him with theGerman Sinn Fein plans, but that no speeches were quoted orevidence produced in the state!neat with respect to the other personsdetained.The opinion was expressed that, in the absence of the chief secretary (who had returned to Ireland) and any official from theIrish Office who could assist the War Cabinet in adding any such statement, it was impossible to add such a statement as the PrimeMinister desired.The War Cabinet therefore decided that The statement as approved should be isstted to the Press atonce. ...2. With reference to War Cabinet 214, Minute 12, lord curzon. drew the attention of the War Cabinet to the visit of theSecretary of State for India to India. Lord Curzon said thatMr. Montagu had gone to India with a Mission to draw up ascheme in order to carry out pledges given with regard to the progressive institution of responsible government in India.Mr. Montagu bad spent six months in India, and had put forwardhis proposals in the form of a Blue Book, which had not yet been circulated to the War Cabinet. The scheme was signed by theViceroy of India and himself. Lord Curzon pointed out that thiswas a very serious document, and requested a decision of the Wat-Cabinet as to the action which was to be taken with this Report.Lord Curzon expressed the opinion that there were threealternatives : (a.) To publish the Report, by which method Indian and british public opinion on the proposals would be shown;(6.) For the War Cabinet to give a perfunctory examination tothe scheme and to authorise the publication of theReport ;(c.) For the War Cabinet carefully to consider the Report andthen authorise its publication, with any necessaryobservations as to their own policy and views.Lord Curzon added that Mr. Montagu was strongly in favour ofthe first alternative. There was not much to be said in favour ofthe second. The third, though it might be- theoretically the best,would involve very considerable delay.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in the absence of thePrime Minister and the Secretary of State for India, it was notpossible to give a definite decision on this question to-day, but thatit would be very helpful to the War Cabinet, when the Report came before them, if Lord Curzon would prepare a memorandum putting forward his views on the scheme.Mr. Chamberlain said that he considered (c) would be the proper course to take if time were available for adequate consideration to begiven to it in the first place, but that was impossible at present.He therefore favoured the adoption of (a). He had suggested toMr. Montagu that he (Mr. Montagu) should put forward, for theconsideration of the War Cabinet, a short memorandum, not for publication, in order to inform the War Cabinet of the opinion which mr. Montagu considered was held by Indians and Anglo-Indians,and of the amount of hacking which his proposals were likely to
The western front.3 The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that therewas no news of importance to report with regard to the western front.As regards the German divisions in the vicinity of the british front, the situation was as follows : There were 14 fresh divisions,all of good quality ; 24 divisions which had been roughly handledbut were now refitted, and 23 fresh divisions in line, which could betaken out by roulement; if the Germans attacked on a 50-kilometrefront, they would have from 20 to 25 more divisions available for the offensive, making a total of 80 to 80. If the Germans deferred their attck until about the 15th June, they would by that time havereached their maximum aATailable force, and might attack with atleast 100 divisions, which would be a larger force than that which took part in the offensive on the 21st March. :r,The War Cabinet requested The Chief of the Imperial General Staff to prepare a statement showing what force the French and ourselves might be ableto put up to oppose such an offensive.Armed merchant cruiser&quot; Moldavia.&quot;4. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that the armed merchant cruiser &quot; Moldavia &quot; had been sunk off Newhaven,and that, amongst others, over 400 United States troops were onboard. He added that, as far as had been ascertained, the whole ofthe passengers and crew had been saved.*In view of the bearing that these armed merchant cruisershad on our total shipping available, the War Cabinet requested The First Lord to furnish them with a statement showingthe total number of armed merchant cruisers that hadbeen lost since the commencement of the war, togetherwith their total&apos;gross tonnage.Russia. 5. The First Sea Lord informed  the War Cabinet   that atelegram had been received from the Naval Attache in Russia tothe effect that the Germans might be expected to enter Petrogradon the 23rd May. He had added that the Soviet government appeared to realise that its end was near, and that it was nowwilling to accept help from anyone.Bruges. 6. With reference to War Cabinet 415, Minutes 6 and 7, the&quot;7 First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that the bombing of therugge. docks at Bruges and Zeebrugge was being continued. Mention beingmade that some of the bombs were falling on the town of Bruges,the First Sea.Lord stated that the town had never been our objec-tive, but that it was impossible to ensure that some districts of the* This has  been  corrected by a  subsequent report, according to  which56 American troops were unaccounted for.receive.    It was also desirable that the opinion of Mr. Montaghscolleagues who accompanied him on his Mis ion to India should be known.    Mr. Montagu had expressed himself as willing to do this.The War Cabinet requested (a.) Lord Curzon to lay befoie the War Cabinet a memorandumputting forward bis views on Mr. Montagu&apos;s report.(6.) The Secretary of State for India to forward to the WarCabinet a memorandum which would give his views ofthe strength of Indian and British-Indian opinion on thesubject of the report, and which would also express theopinion of the other members of the mission to India.
town, in the vicinity of the docks, would not be hit during an attackon the latter.The Secretary informed the War Cabinet that a telegram hadbeen sent the pi-previous day (No. 58872 -D.M.O.) to General Head-quarters, France, to the effect that, in view of the vital importanceof exploiting to the full the present unique opportunity of destroyingenemy submarine and other craft in Bruges Dock, it had been decidedthat the bombing units of the 5th Group should be reinforcedtemporarily from the units under Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s command.Losses in 7. Attention was drawn to the losses which had taken placeMediterranean in the Mediterranean   convoy, as reported in the &quot; Overdue andConvoy. Captured List of British Vessels &quot; issued by the Admiralty on the20th May.The First Lord stated that the protection to the mercantilemarine in the Mediterranean at the present time was totally inade-quate, and that the traffic was at present running a greater risk than usual, owing to some patrol vessels being taken off convoy work and being trained for work on the Otranto barrage, where it is thought they will ultimately afford a better protection.Admiral Wemyss pointed out that- we were short of destroyerseverywhere, and that our escorts were greatly strained, owing to theneed of convoying transports bringing over United States troops.The western front.Aeroplane Losses.8. The Chief of the Air Staff informed the War Cabinet thatduring the past week we had brought down 177 German machines,and that a further 51 had also been forced to land after engagementwith our aeroplanes.    Our losses were 63 missing.AeroplaneMovements.9. The Chief of the Air Staff informed the War Cabinet that two reconnaissance flights had been removed from the southern partof the French front to the northern portion ; that there was some increase in aerodrome accommodation in the Lille sector; that alarge number of enemy scouts had been carrying out( night recou-reconnaissances at great altitudes north of the River Lys, and that theirbombing machines had been very active of late in bombing our backareas.German AerialAttack on BaseHospital.10. Questioned as to the reports that had appeared in the pressas to a German attack on a base hospital, Major-General Sykesstated that he was inclined to believe that the act was not a deliberateone on the part of the enemy.It was pointed out that the hospit-d, which was situated atFtaples, was inclose proximity to a very important railway junction.Attention was called, however, to the report that the Germanaeroplanes had used their machine-guns.The War Cabinet requested  The Secretary of State for War to furnish, for their information,a full report of the attack.General Aerial ii   The War Cabinet had under consideration a paper by the^ollcy- Air Minister on General Aerial Policy (Paper G.T.-4622).It was pointed out that the Air Policy Committee of the WarCabinet comprised, among others, the Heads of Departments mainly concerned with the questions in the paper, viz., the First Lord of theAdmiralty, the Secretary of State for War, and the Air Minister,and it was suggested that the initial portion of Sir William Weir&apos;s
12. The War Cabinet next considered the second part of theAir Minister&apos;s paper, which dealt with the arrangements necessaryfor carrying out the progressive developments of long-range bombing of Germany, and requested that the following propositions shouldbe put before the Supreme War Council at as early a date aspossible : (a.) The formation of the   independent  long-range  bombingCommand ;(6.) Its ultimate development into an Inter Allied Command,under a British General Officer Commanding, so long asthe British portion is larger;(c.) M. Clemenceau to obtain the support of the French Armyauthorities to this scheme.The Secretary of State for War stated that lie was in entire agreement with the Air Ministers views on this subject, and would strongly support them. Pie anticipated, however, great difficultyin securing the approbation and co-operation of the French, for thefollowing reasons : -(i.) They would wish to insist that the independent Air force should be under General Foch. To this plea, however,Lord Milner considered we had a good answer,(&quot;ii.) The French were becoming1 seriously alarmed at the growingactivity of the Germans in respect of the intensivebombing of theii towns. Our own long-range bombing operations started from French territory, and theFrench feared that their own country would suffermost from the euemy&apos;s retaliation.It was suggested that it might be advisable to wait for a fewmonths before approaching the French, as General Trenchard would,by that time, be fully established in his new Command, and wouldhave a large force at his disposal. What was especially necessary atthe moment was the sanction of the Cabinet to the long-rangebombing policy outlined in Sir William Weir&apos;s paper.On the other hand, it was pointed out that a telegram hadalready been sent by the Foreign Office on the 23rd instant (ForeignOffice telegram No. 1026d) to Lord Derby, stating that the Ail-Council had constituted an independent force for the purpose ofcarrying out bombing raids on a large scale, and asking Lord Derbyto inform the French Government immediately of this arrangement,to secure their recognition of General Trenchard&apos;s separate Command,and to request them to put ail necessary facilities at the disposal ofthe Loyal Air Force in France. The telegram further stated that,as these long-range operations would soon partake of an international character, His Majesty&apos;s Government proposed that the broad linesof action should be laid down by the Supreme War Council.In reply to a question, the Chief of the Imperial General staff said that he understood that the independent character of GeneralTrenchard&apos;s Command, the fact of which bad been communicated to long-rangeBombing.paper, dealing with the broad lines of aerial policy, should be referredto that Committee in the first instance.The War Cabinet decided that The Air Policy Committee should be asked to examine the first part of the Air Ministers paper, and to report in due course as to whether they recommended its adoption in itspresent or a modified form. In the event of an agreement being reached at the Committee between the Pleads of theDepartments concerned, the decision of the Air PolicyCommittee should be final.
the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-chief, had been fully accepted bySir Douglas Haig, but undertook to make certain of this. He also pointed out that General Trenchard&apos;s force would be stationed in,and would operate from, the French zone, and not behind theBritish lines.The War Cabinet decided To adopt the Air MinisteFs memorandum on the independentAir Force Command for long-range bombing on Germany,and further agreed that, subject to the Prime MinisteFsapproval, this policy should be given the fullest supportwhen the subject came up before the Supreme War Council.American 13. The War Cabinet then examined the third part of the AirAviation. Ministers memorandum, dealing with American aviation.The Air Minister emphasised the necessity for establishing onthis side of the Atlantic an American Air Staff, which must be notonly empowered to confer with the British and French Air Staffs onaerial matters, but should further be authorised, as soon as definitedecisions had been arrived at by the three Staffs, to send instructionsto America which would require no further sanction prior to beingacted upon.The First Lord stated that no objection had been raised inregard to paragraph 2 (a) of this portion of the Air MinisteFsmemorandum, but he demurred to sections (6) and (c) of the saidparagraph, which left to American resources the provision of largeaircraft and strategic bombing, anti-submarine work and protectiveaircraft. In view of the fact that, in aeronautical manufacture, theUnited States had proved so tar a broken reed, he disputed the wisdom of committing the War Cabinet to these proposals.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff expressed the hopethat, whatever policy in this respect might be adopted, there wouldbe no clashing with the Aviation Committee of the Supreme WarCouncil at Versailles, where there was already in existence an inter-Allied organisation to deal with aeronautical questions.Lord Bobert Cecil said that, as regards America, there was a fundamental difference between that country and the other co-belligerents. The Washington Government was apparently notprepared to trust, or concede any real authority to, their represen-tatives. This, he said, was conspicuously the case as regards their shipping delegates, and he cited other instances of the reluctance ofthe United States Government to allow their representatives freedomof action.The Air Minister hoped that there would be no delay in gettingto work on the right lines : it was all-important to have in thiscountry a competent and authoritative American Air Staff, even if their authority only lasted long enough to enable a definite combinedprogramme to be laid down now for the spring of next year.After further discussion, and in view of the foregoing considera-tion, the War Cabinet decided (a.) To approve the recommendations contained in paragraph &quot;4 (a)of the third portion of the Air MinisteFs memorandum ;(ft.) To refer sub-sections (b). (c), and (d) of the said paragraph to the Air Policy Committee, for examination and report.;(c) To approve the proposal ^sub-section (e)) to send a british mission of experts to Washington, subject to the con-currence of Lord Reading.14. With reference to War Cabinet 395, Minute 1, the WarCabinet had before them a memorandum by the Coal Controller,with a covering note from Sir Albert Stanley (Paper G.T.-4614) onthe subject of the recruitment from coal mines, together with aMan-power.Recruitment from coal Mines.
memorandum bv General Nash (Paper G.T.-4562) on the coal situation in france the Coal Controller explained that the situation at the end of1917 admitted of the recruiting of 50,000 men from the mines for theArmy, and it was agreed that the Hume Office should decertificateminers between the ages of 18*8 and 25 with the object of 50,000Grade I. men being taken. Before this number had been withdrawnfrom the mines it was agreed that a second quota of 50,000 men should be given up under certain conditions. When he agreed tothese proposals he was unaware of certain factors involving increased demands for shipment: -(1.) Improvement in shipping position brought about by changesin convoy system, resulting in the shortening of time forvoyages, and thusmakiug neutral and other tonnage more quickly available.(2.) Increased obligations entered into by other departments with neutrals.(3.) Increased French demand due to results of German offensive.At a later date, in view of the above considerations, the controller of Coal Mines informed the Minister of National Service that hecould only agree to 25,000 men being taken in the month of May(War Cabinet 395, Minute 1). The making good of the outputof the Pas-de-Calais mines and the increased demands for coal byneutrals, and the improved shipping position, had materially altered the coal situation, and he therefore asked that not more than62,500 Grade I. pre-war miners should be posted to the Army orenlisted in the Royal Navy, the Royal Naval A^olunteer Reserve,or the Royal Marines, since the 1st January, 1918, and that no menof lower grades should be taken from the coal mines other than such23ost-outbreak-of&apos;-war miners as may still remain and be liable torecruitment until such time, as the full effect of the withdrawal ofthat number of men is determined.Major Lloyd Greame said that the decision of the War Cabinetreducing the second quota of coal miners to 25,000 has been basedon the assumption that the Coal Controller would have to meet the worst possible situation in the Pas-de-Calais coalfield, viz. : 750,000tons a month. (See Annex G.T-4282.) That being so, thenecessary supplies for France and Italy could be maintained withoutany further reduction of the number of men to be recruited. the recruiting of the second quota of 25,000 miners was now in full swing,and it would be very difficult suddenly to cease recruiting. The effectof permanently leaving out some men who happened to be lower down on the ballot than others who had been taken was bound to bringtrouble. It would also affect unfavourably the other recruitingschemes. Already the recruiting returns for this month were dis-appointing. This was owing to the repercussion on the tribunals of the weakening on the part of the protected industries in their supply of men. He felt that the situation in the mines might be relieved if the Army could go on releasing men. Already 2,000had been approved, and 7,000 names of men in lower categoriesthan B. I. had been handed in.Lord Milner said that the position was most serious. Twomonths ago, after the reverse to our Army, we adopted extrememeasures to save the situation. It was realised that American helpwould tide us over until the month of August, but after that datewe should have to rely on our own recruiting. Now that there wasa pause in the German attack, every point of our recruiting pro-gramme was beginning to break down, and demands for the releaseof men were coming in on every side. He thought that the. claims of recruiting must have priority. There would be a big german attack very shortly, and we must be prepared for it.
Sir Leo Chiozza Money said that the Shipping Controllertook a grave view of the export coal situation and that he had prepared a. further memorandum on the subject which urged strongly that the recruitment of miners should not proceed beyond the firstquota of 50,000.    The chief points that lie desired to urge were : (a.) The danger of an aggravated coal crisis in France and Italy.France was sending 220,000 tons of coal per month (outof a promised 350,000 tons) to Italy by rail, and if she were compelled to stop this we should have to compen-sate Italy by sea-borne coal.(b.) By export coal arrangements to neutrals we, in effect,bought the use of large blocks of neutral tonnage without which we could not obtain ore, pyrites, and other indis-. pensable imports. These arrangements were made in ourown interests and were moreover obligations into whichwe had entered.(c.) There would be great danger to our bunker stocks in theMediterranean and elsewhere, with consequent risk to alltonnage movements.id.) The clanger of serious waste of tonnage owing to vesselshaving to :-ail without cargoes or to be diverted. Alreadythis was taking place : in the three weeks ended the18th May no lt-ss than 200,000 tons of shipping which ought to have taken out coal had to sail in ballast.(e.) If we failed to export coal to South America, the americans would be compelled to use more tonnage in that trade,with consequent grave reaction upon Atlantic traffic.,He pointed out further that the failure to obtain coal cargoes inApril and May was in spite of the fact that fewer than 50,000miners had yet been recruited and that the Br^uay position had notdeveloped to the worst. What would be the position if the Brfimaysupply altogether failed and the Coal Controller had to make up thefurther big deficiency ?Lord Robert Cecil pointed out that we had undertaken heavyobligations for the supply of coal to France and Italy, and to neutral countries. It would be disastrous if a coal famine was created inany of the Allied countries, especially in Italy. He was perfectlywilling to do his utmost to reduce the demands of neutrals, but he hoped that the Cabinet would consider the serious effect of any reduction of the demands of France and Italy.Mr. Calthrop said that if our obligations to neutrals were tobe maintained, it would result in the munition works going short.The supplies for domestic and industrial consumption at home were considerably behind, and it took time to elaborate a general schemeof rationing. If he could be allowed some latitude in restrictingsupplies to neutrals, he would do his best to furnish the minerspromised for the Army. He felt that both France and Italy shouldhave priority over neutrals.Lord Robert Cecil suggested that there might be a small Coin-rnittee appointed to go into the question of the supply of coal to neutrals with a view to arranging the most equitable distribution ofthe available supplies.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The recruitment of miners should proceed up to the numberof 75,000  Grade I. men from the 1st January, 1918,including voluntary enlistments;(b.) France and Italy should have priority over neutral countriesin regard to supplies of British coal;(c.) Lord Robert Cecil should summon a Committee, consistingof representatives of 
J. 2S9eCRot&quot;?Navr I5- Ml&quot;- CalthroP dreW the attention of the War Cabinet toy ^&apos;      the recruitment from the mines for the Navy and the Boyal NavalVolunteers.    He asked that this should cease.The Secretary pointed out that on the 25th March, 1918 (WarCabinet 372, Minute 10), the War Cabinet decided that the recruit-ment for the Navy should cease for two months, which, by agree-ment between the Departments, had afterwards been reduced to one month.   That period had now expired.The Second Sea Lord laid stress on the importance of recruitingminers for continuous service in the Navy as stokers.    Unless this were done, the Navy would be seriously handicapped at the conclusion of peace.The War Cabinet decided that The recruitment for the Navy from the mines should cease until further notice.Allied 1G. The War Cabinet had before them the note of a conversa-Interyention in tion between Lord Robert Cecil and the Japanese AmbassadorSiberia. (Paper G.T.-4617), in regard to Allied intervention in Siberia, and acopy of a telegram, dated the 19th May, 1918, from Baron Goto tothe Japanese Ambassador in London.  (Appendix.)Lord Robert Cecil explained that in this telegram four ques-tions had been asked to which His Majesty&apos;s Government were invited to reply. It was obvious, from the first three of thesequestions, that the Japanese Government did not wish us to continuenegotiating with the Soviet Government, or wait until they (theSoviet Government) asked for Allied intervention in Siberia. then there was the question of Semenoff. The Japanese were supportingthis General, but we had told the Bolshevik Government that wewere not doing so, and that he was advancing at his own risk. TheJapanese wished to know what our attitude was in regard to theSemenoff movement. Lord Robert Cecil continued that he thought we should deal perfectly frankly with the Soviets. He himself was prepared to back Semenoff, provided that his activities were part andparcel of an Allied movement, otherwise we should have nothing todo with him.The opinion was expressed that we might leave Semenoffentirely to the Japanese, and t-ay nothing to Trotzki unless thematter were raised by him. It was suggested, however, that this\\ ould not be dealing frankly with the Soviets, as, should inter-vention in Siberia ever materialise and Semenoff become part of theAllied movement, we should naturally support him. To recogniseSemenoff now, on the other hand, was to recognise an avowedenemy of the Bolsheviks.After further discussion the War Cabinet decided that The question involved decisions too momentous to be arrived atwithout the presence of the Prime Minister and the Secre-tary of State for Foreign Affairs,The Foreign Office,The Board of Trade,The Ministry of Shipping,to go into the question of the demands of foreign countries for coal.(d.) The Board of Trade should at once initiate a scheme forrationing industrial and domestic coal supplies at home.
and they therefore instructed -The Secretary to put the matter down on the agenda on theearliest possible elate, when both the Prime Ministerand the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs would be present.Exchange of l7  With reference to War Cabinet 415, Minute 11, the WarPrisoners ot War. Cabinet discussed a telegram (No. 1885 it) received from ThePlague with regard to the exchange of prisoners with Germany.The telegram stated that General Friederich was now at The Hague,and wanted to know whether British delegates could not go there atonce and discuss the question.Lord Newton said that he would like the Cabinets view as tothe proposal we were prepared to make. It would be difficult todo less than the French had done, and he thought we might tellGermany that we were prepared to consider an agreement on thesame lines.It was pointed out, however, that care should be taken overusing the words i! on the same lines,&quot; which the Secretary was directed to delete from the draft minutes of the previous day.The Admiralty, in the discussion on this subject yesterday, hadexpressly asked that certain ratings of the captured crews fromsubmarines should not be included in any exchange. An agreement on the lines of the BYench exchange might involve this.Lord Newton said he thought there was little danger of this, asa representative of the Admiralty could attend the negotiations, andin any case it would take at least a year to put any agreementinto force.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) Lord Newton should draft a telegram for the ForeignOffice to send to Sir W. Townley, enquiring whetherthe Germans were prepared to discuss an agreement forthe exchange of prisoners of war, and stating that, in theevent of a reply in the affirmative, we were prepared tosend representatives to The Hague to discuss thequestion.(6.) Lord Newton should lay before the War Cabinet draft pro-posals to form the basis of such exchange.2, Whiteh.aU Gardens, S.W.,May 24, 1918.
APPENDIX.(With reference to War Cabinet 417, Minute 16.)Question op Allied Intervention in Siberia.I. Note of a Conversation between Lord R. Cecil and the Japanese Ambassador.II. Copy of a Telegram from Baron Goto to the Japanese Ambassador in London.I.Note of a Conversation between Lord li. Cecil and. the Japanese Ambassador, in theform of a Draft Telegram to Sir C. Greene, Tokyo.THE Japanese Ambassador called on me to-day and left with me a copy of atelegram which be had received from Baron Goto.He read it to me, and I told him that the questions raised in it were so important that I could not give him a final answer without further consideration; but if he would allow me to express my private opinions on the subject, for what they were worth, Ishould be glad to do so.He assented, and I then told him that, in my view, the situation in Russiarendered the question of intervention extremely urgent. As far as I was concerned, Ishould be quite willing that Semenoff should be supported, if that was the wish ofthe Japanese military authorities. In the same way, the Government had been anxiousto make use of the Czecho-Slovaks now collecting at Vladivostock, and we had approached the French Government on the subject. I recognised that these forces could be effective only if they were strongly supported by Japan, and if that happenedI should be quite willing that Japan should take the direction of the whole expedition,provided of course that the Japanese made it clear that they were going into Siberia,not for the purpose of obtaining any territorial advantage, but in order to assistRussiaand the Allied cause generally ; and provided that the Japanese were preparedto push their expedition as far west as Chiliabinsk, or somewhere in that neighbourhood.With respect to the particular questions in the telegram that he had read to me,I told him that Mr. Lockhart believed that joint action in Moscow with the Soviet-Government would be successful, but that he had now arrived at the conclusion that intervention was so urgent that we ought to act whether we obtained the invitation ofthe Bolshevist Government or not. I did not deal specifically with the second and thirdquestions, nor did I express a definite opinion as to whether we should leave Semenoffin the lurch, but 1 promised to consider that.The Ambassador asked me what was the state of affairs in Washington.I avoided giving him a direct reply, but I read him a passage from your telegramNo. 535, in which Baron Goto is reported to have said that the President showed some signs of reconsidering his objections, and I told the Ambassador that we would spare no effort to obtain American approval for intervention.I then asked him whether he thought that his Government, with Americanapproval, would be prepared to intervene to the extent of sendiug a force to Chiliabinskor thereabouts for the purpose of making a diversion which might oblige the Germans to diminish their forces on the Western front.The Ambassador professed that this was an entirely new idea, and said that hisGovernment had so far considered only the necessity of intervening to prevent Germanpenetration to the Pacific coast. The proposal that they should intervene in generalassistance of the Allied cause had not, as far as be knew, been fully considered by them.I then said that the matter was of the utmost importance; that the whole courseof the war might be determined by an effective intervention in Siberia; and that Iventured to appeal to the Japanese, as our Allies, to do their utmost to come to our assistance. I added that if we knew that they were ready to intervene on this scaleour hands would be greatly strengthened in any negotiations we might have in washington.
He again said that, from his own point of view, he would be glad to give afavourable reply, but that he felt be could not do so without consulting his Government,as the matter was undoubtedly a new one to them.I did not tell him that this appeared to be inconsistent with the tenor of BaronGoto&apos;s observations to your Excellency and with the various communications whichhave been made to us by the Japanese General staff the Ambassador left me, saying that he would report to his Government the observations I had made as coming from myself, and that he would hope to have in thecourse of a few days an official reply to the telegram which he had left with me.(Initialled) R. G.Foreign Office, May 22, 19 IS.II.Copy of Telegram, dated May 19, from Baron Goto to the Japanese ambassador in London.Some time ago the British Government made a proposal to the Imperial Govern-nient looking to an intervention in Siberia, which they deemed necessary in order to check the penetration of German influence. Subsequently, however, having regard tothe attitude of the American Government in the matter, the British Government are understood to have found it advisable to induce, if possible, the Soviet Government to invite the Allied intervention, and instructed Mr. Lockhart to enter upon the negotia-tions with the Soviet Government on these lines. The recent course of these negotiations is unknown to the Imperial Government, but it is presumed that no concrete result has yet been obtained. On the other hand, the British Government, fearing that thecontinued support on the part of the Allies to the Semenoff detachment, whose avowedobject is to crush the Bolsheviks might hinder the progress of the negotiations above referred to, requested the Japanese Government to give also an advice to Semenoff, witha view to restraining for the time being the advance of his detachment. The desiredadvice was given to Semenoff through a Japanese in touch with him, but it is found impossible to dissuade him from his determination. On the contrary, he is continuinghis advance encouraged by the success he has so far achieved over the Bolsheviks, and,thanks to the continuous enlistment of the Cossacks in his detachment, its strengthhas already reached 5,000 and is growing stronger every day. He is now menacingKalimuskaya.You are hereby requested to seek an interview with the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, and in calling his attention to the above circumstances you will expressto him the deep concern felt by the Imperial Government in regard to the situationthus created for them as well as for the Allies, and ask for the frank expression of his views on. the following points : 1. Is there any positive prospect of Mr. LockhaiFs efforts in inducing the SovietGovernment to invite the Allied intervention being crowned with the desiredsuccess in an immediate future ?2. In the event of an invitation for the Allied intervention being extended by theSoviet Government, the immediate object aimed at by the latter would presumably be either the suppression of the recalcitrant elements in thecountry or the defence of Russia against the German invasion. In theopinion of the Imperial Government, it appears that in the first case therewould be no reason for the Allies to accept the invitation, while in thesecond case, so long as the German military operations do not extend toSiberia, the scheme of despatching troops there, as originally proposed bythe British Government, would not be compatible with the object as held inview by the Soviet Government. What would be the views of the BritishGovernment on this point ?3. It is true that the Soviet Government are now exercising the actual power invarious parts in Russia, but they can hardly be said to represent the will ofRussians in general. It is a pa/tent fact that there exist a great manyelements totally incompatible with the said Government owing to theprofound animosity felt against them. In these circumstances, it is feared that the Allied intervention undertaken as the result of an- understanding with the Soviet Government, even though with the object of resisting the
German aggression would be liable to provoke the ill-feelings of theseelements against the Allies, as having the effect of strengthening the positionof the Soviet Government. What would be the opinion of the BritishGovernment on this point ?Semenoff launched forth the present enterprise in entire reliance upon the moral and material support of the British, French, and Japanese Governments, andit is not without reason that he should be counting upon the continuousassistance of the Allies. If the Allies were to stop their help suddenly atthe present moment and leave him in the lurch, would it not bring aboutthe loss of their prestige in the eyes of Semenoff&apos;s friends, and give the falseimpression to the general populace in Russia that the Allies are unreliable,with the result of driving them into the arms of Germany ?o
