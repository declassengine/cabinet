The Adriatic:British AeroplaneAttack.1. TFIE First Sea Lord reported that, on the 23rd April, liveBritish aeroplanes left Otranto to attack Durazzo. The machinesattacked merchant-ships and a seaplane base, dropping two 230-lb.bombs and 16 .100-lb. bombs, with apparently successful results.All the machines returned safely.Seaplanes.Submarines.2. The First Sea Lord stated that, in an aerial fight with sevenenemy seaplanes off the North Hinder position yesterday, one of ourseaplanes, which was manned by two United States officers, was lost.  &apos;3. The First Sea Lord reported that His Majesty&apos;s ship &quot; dessa-mine &quot; dropped six depth charges on a submarine off Carnsore Pointyesterday, and picked up one prisoner, who stated that the sub-marine was the &quot;U 104.&quot;Admiral Wemyss stated that a report had been received from gibraltar to the effect that His Majesty&apos;s ship &quot; Chrysanthemum,&quot;when 42 miles off Cape Spartel, sighted a submarine on the 24thApril, and dropped depth charges. Wreckage; was seen, and it wasconsidered that the submarine was sunk.The First Sea Lord also reported that information had beenreceived from Cape Town that the steamship &quot; Headcliffe &quot; had been attacked by a submarine on the 6th April off Cape Verde. A gun-nery action of some length took place, in which the submarine fired120 rounds, and the ship sixty-one rounds. The ship was not hit,but, as the action was discontinued for no apparent reason, it isbelieved that the submarine was.Loss ofH.M.S. &quot;Cowslip.&apos;4. The First Sea Lord stated that H.M.S. &quot; Cowslip &quot; had been torpedoed 10 miles from Cape Spartei yesterday morning, and thatthe. ship had been sunk.   The survivors had been taken on boardNaval Baid onZeebrugge andOstend.5. In continuation of War Cabinet 399, Minute 7, the First sea lord informed the War Cabinet that the photographs taken overZeebrugge were much masked by clouds, and indistinct, but thatthe following facts had been ascertained : The &quot; Iphigenia,&quot; bows to east and stern to west, is lying at about an angle of 60&quot; to thetransverse of the Canal; her stern is just at the line of the shore at high-water mark. The &quot; Intrepid,&quot; bows to the east and stem tothe west, is lying at an angle of about 45D to the transverse of the canal. The line of-the shore at high-water-mark cuts her amid-ships. There are indications of the &quot; Thetis &quot; 100 yards north ofthe western escalade. This cannot be clearly determined in thephotograph. The steel pile viaduct to the mole is breached for100 to 120 feet clear about .100 feet from the south end. of the mole.A temporary bridge has been placed across the gap. Apparentlyonlv three or four bare-es of the boom defence remain.Murmansk.6. With, reference to War Cabinet 393, Minute 17, the first sea Lord said that he had received a report from the Rear-Admiralat Murmansk which stated that the declaration made at the openingmeeting was well received, and that similar declarations were madeby the French and American representatives. The Rear-Admiralwas of opinion that Allied assistance in Siberia would probably be welcomed, although isolated Japanese help would be resisted. he deprecated the squandering of Allied resources in Siberia whenthey might be used to more effect in the northern provinces ofEuropean Russia.
WC 400The Western Front. 7. The Director of Military Operations reported that the situa-tiou in the northern area of the Western front was not satisfactory.Apparently the main attack had been made on the French, onKemmel Hill, and it was thought that the Germans now held the hill. He stated that we have troops north of Kemmel village, butthere was no definite information as to where the French line west of Kemmel Hill now ran. The attack on the Hill was made fromthe south and east, after a heavy gas attack. General Radcliffeexpressed the opinion that General Foch would make every effort to regain, this position, for, unless this were done, it would be bothdifficult and costly to maintain our present line east of Ypres. he explained the position on a map, pointing out that Kemmel Hillwas an isolated position commanding very extensive Views over thecountry to the north-east and north. The ground sloped awaygradually to the low-lying marshy ground in the Ypres basin.General Radcliffe said that, if a retirement did take place, it wasnot intended to uncover the flank of the inundated country to thenorth, for, if this were done, the Belgian army would have difficultyin maintaining their present position.With regard to the position in the southern area of operations,General Radcliffe said that -this was satisfactory ; Villers- Bretonneuxhad been recaptured and a number of prisoners taken. There hadbeen heavy fighting, and the operation had probably been costly on both, sides, but the capture of between 400 and 500 german prisoners was reported.8. With reference to War Cabinet 390, Minute 4, the possibilityof obtaining reinforcements from Salouica was discussed, and it waspointed out that the Chief of the imperial General Staff had telegraphed to General Milne suggesting that the British divisions in Salonica might be reduced to nine battalions, as had been done inFrance. If this action were taken, twelve battalions would beavailable to reinforce the Western front. A strong protest, however,to this proposed course of action had been received froM. Clemenceau.S). With reference to War Cabinet 393, Minute .13, attention was called to a statement in the press to the effect that the Austriansproposed to send an army, commanded by an Austrian Archduke, tothe Western front.The Prime Minister said that he had spoken to the Director ofMilitary Intelligence on this question, who was of opinion that thearmy referred to was one of eight divisions, the whereabouts ofwhich, as he had previously reported, were unknown.The opinion was expressed that, if it were ascertained that this movement was taking place, it would be advisable for some Italiandivisions also to be moved to the Western front.The War Cabinet requested The Secretary of State for War to call the attention of theSupreme War Council at Versailles to the information given in the Austrian press.10. With reference to War Cabinet 39C, Minute 11, the AVarCabinet had before them a note by General Smuts on the Russiansituation (Paper G.T.-4322).General Smuts said that he had just seen a telegram fromMr. Lockhart which raised a similar question to that which he wasputting forward, pointing out that it was quite clear that, before any action could be taken in Russia, some common plan must be agreedupon between the Allies.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed out that theFrench, the Italians, and the British had always been in favour of intervention in Siberia, but that the Americans had not yet come toTroops fromMacedonia.Austrians on theWestern Front.The EussianSituation.
a definite decision on the question. The difficulty was that it wasimpossible to approach the Japanese with any definite proposals until an answer from America had been received, and the difficulties might be accentuated by the fact that the Japanese Foreign Minister,who had just been appointed, was supposed to have pro-Germansympathies.General Smuts considered that it would be advisable that adefinite plan of action should be thought out and submitted for theconsideration of the American Government. He was of opinion thatMr. Lockhart&apos;s proposal of an Allied Mission to Siberia should be supported, but that, if the intervention of an Allied army in Russiawere agreed upon, the Russians on their side must put all therailways at the disposal of the force, and understand that theintention was, not to occupy Siberia, but to carry on active operations against the enemy in Russia.Mr. Balfour called attention, to a visit which he had receivedfrom the American Ambassador yesterday, when Mr. Page told him of the visit to Russia of an officer of the American Secret service department, who had been sent by the American Government. Thisofficer had obtained possession of many secret documents, which hehad brought back to England. These documents had beenphotographed, and the originals had now gone to America. Fromthe photographs which had been taken, there was apparently ampleproof that M. Trotzki had, even up to February last, been in leaguewith the Germans, and had been obeying instructions which theGerman Government had sent him.The opinion was expressed that this did not necessarily mean that M. Trotzki was not prepared to co-operate with the Allies.From all the evidence which had come to.hand recently, it could beassumed that he was prepared now to quarrel with the Germans,and it was pointed out that the Red Guards with British and french forces were now all working harmoniously at Murmansk.The War Cabinet decided that.....Ilie Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should telegraph toLord Reading asking him to urge the American Govern-ment to reply as soon as possible to the former telegram(No. 2303), dated the 19th April, on this subject.11. The attention of the War Cabinet was called to anAdmiralty memorandum on the subject of the future of the Russianfleets (Paper G.T.-4344).In this memorandum the First Lord, of the Admiralty had stated that, with regard to the destruction of the Baltic Fleet and tothe destruction, of removal to jSWorossisk of the Black Sea Fleet, itwould seem that the only course was to bring as much pressure aspossible to bear upon M Trotzki through Mr. Lockhart, although,of course, it was realised that the chances of M. Trotzki being-induced to take definite action with regard to the safeguarding ofthe Russian ships now in the Black Sea and the destruction ofRussian ships in the Baltic to avoid capture by the Germans werenot very great.The War Cabinet decided that The First Lord of the Admiralty should prepare material for atelegram, on this subject to be sent by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs to Mr. Lockhart.Holland. .12. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs called attentionto a conversation which Sir Leverton Harris bad had yesterdaA^morning with M. van Vollenhoven, the delegate from the Nether-lands Government, who had been conducting the shipping andgeneral agreement negotiations in this country.   M. van Vollenhoven.Future of RussianFleets.
WC 400had stated that he had been recalled to Holland, and gave as hisreason for this sudden recall that the German Government wereincensed against Holland because they believed that Holland could have prevented the Allies requisitioning her tonnage. The GermanGovernment apparently were adopting the attitude that they hadthe right to the same advantages from Holland on land as the allies had obtained by the requisitioning of Dutch, shipping, and that,as Dutch shipping was to be used for the transport of Allied troops and. war material, the Dutch railways and other means of Communication-cation must also be used for the same purposes for the Germans.M. van Vollenhoven had stated that the Netherlands Governmentwould reply to the Germans as they had done to the Allies thatthey would not agree to the carriage of articles for military use, andthat they would not accede to the German demands regarding sandand gravel except on the conditions that they must be allowed totake steps to assure themselves that the sand and gravel will not beused for military purposes. In the meantime, the Dutch would refuse to enter into any negotiations with either side. M. vanVollenhoven had further stated that the strong feeling which showeditself in Holland following upon our requisitioning of Dutch shipping-had very largely died down, and that now there was a very strong and bitter feeling against Germany in favour of refusing herdemands. Holland, he had further stated, knew perfectly well thather interests lay with the Allies, and that a German victory in thewar would mean the end of the independence of Holland. M. vanVollenhoven had said that the situation was serious. Mr. Balfourwas of opinion that Germany would shrink from pressing matters toextremities, hut that we must be prepared for some act on the partof Germany which would drive Holland into the war.Attention was drawn to telegram No. 1622. in which the british ambassador at The Hague called attention to the new condition which the Germans had demanded, namely, the free passage ofGerman and Austrian ships at Antwerp down the Scheldt, and to theagreement of the Netherlands Government to transit over theLimburg railways goods of a purely non-military character.Mr. Balfour said that the Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairshoped that some arrangement might be arrived at, but thought thatGiermany was really seeking some pretext for a quarrel. the transit of sand and gravel appeared to be the most difEcuft cptestion.Mr. Balfour expressed the opinion that it would not be possible to object to the proposal to use the Limburg railways for the transit of civilian stores, but it was pointed out that, when the British Govern-ment asked leave to transit coal to Italy purely for civilian purposes,the Swiss Government would not agree (telegram No. 51oa).The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that a very dangerous situation would arise if the Scheldt became available to german warships, as it would become a very formidable base forsubmarine operations.General Smuts said that plans had been prepared to deal withthis situation, and that, if the War Office had their report on thisquestion ready, it would be advisable that a meeting of the NorthernNeutrals Committee should take place that afternoon in order todiscuss any steps which it might be necessary to take.The Director of Military Operations said that the War Officereport would be sent over that morning.The War Cabinet requested General Smuts to reassemble the Northern Neutrals Committeeto meet that afternoon and to report to the Prime minister the necessary steps which should be taken in the event ofthe entry of Holland into the war.
Indian Reforms: 13. ln continuation of War Cabinet 399, Minute 14, LordGrant of King&apos;s       Islington informed the War Cabinet that he had received a privateCommissions to        telegram (Paper G.T.-4342) from the Viceroy of India, stating that11 ians&apos; the recommendations of the Government of India, as set out in his telegram dated the 22nd April, 1914, were put forward by theCommander-in-Chief himself with a full sense of responsibility, andthat their rejection would greatly hamper the efforts of the Govern-ment of India. Lord Islington explained that this telegram arrivedsubsequent to the decision of the War Cabinet of the previous day,but that the Viceroy in sending it was not aware of the decision,which had not as yet been communicated to him. The Viceroy&apos;telegram also stated that if the Government of India was notempowered to give temporary King&apos;s commissions on the scalerecommended, they would have to press for a larger number ofpermanent King&apos;s commissions for Indians, but that the latter con-cession would involve difficulties when establishments were reducedat the end of the war. Lord Islington stated that, in the opinionof the military advisers of the India Office (Appendix)-an opinion which had the entire concurrence of the military members of theArmy Council-the granting at once of a large number of tem-porary King&apos;s commissions to Indians would deter British officers from joining the Indian Army. Also, it was very doubtful whether,from a military point of view, the measure was necessary, as indian officers with commissions in the native land forces possessed thesame powers and performed the same duties in the Indian Armyduring the war as British officers of the Indian Army. At thesame time he felt that the strongly expressed opinion of the Viceroy,and the fact that the proposal came from, and was deemedessential by, the Commander-in-Chief, should not be lightlydisregarded.The opinion was expressed that the question turned on whether the greater military efficiencj&apos; likely to result from sucha measure would be commensurate with the obvious disadvantagesit involved. If the granting of these commissions would be followedby the recruitment of a large number of Indians of fighting stockswho could be used for setting free our white forces in India, Egypt,and Salonica, then the matter was worth consideration. There was always the risk, however, that recruitment might be pushed beyondthe point at which good material was available, and in that case there was little or no advantage in stimulating further efforts.Lord Curzon warned the War Cabinet against a hasty andinsufficiently considered decision on a question which had exercisedthe minds of the British and Indian Governments ior the last 25years. He urged that the scheme for granting Iving&apos;s corn-missions to Indians was essentially one that should be proceeded with cautiously and step by step. Only a v^ear ago we had beenasked to grant nine such commissions, and now the number had risen to 200. He doubted whether the political advantage of this measure would be as great as the Government of India anticipated.The future of the British army in India must be considered, andhe (Lord Curzon) strongly urged that the Commander-in-Chief inIndia should state on what grounds he justified the change fromthe view he expressed a year ago.Mr. Chamberlain agreed with Lord Curzon, and said that hethought the War Cabinefs decision of yesterday should be com-municated to the Government of India, and that they should be giventhe opportunity of re-stating their case if they so desired. Whendoing this, however, the Government of India should state fullywhat military resrdts they expected from their proposals.General Smuts stated the Government of India evidentlyregarded this matter as vital. It should be remembered that thecourse of the campaigns in Mesopotamia and Palestine might be influenced by the granting of these 200 commissions. Probablythis larger question of policy had induced the Commander-in-Chief,India, to change his views.   In General Smuts&apos; opinion, the result
of the campaign in Mesopotamia and Palestine was of more importance than any disadvantages that might ensue from the granting of 200commissions.The Prime Minister said that it would he a serious thing forthe War Cabinet to go against the advice of one so experienced in indian affairs as Lord Curzon, and against the military opinion ofGeneral Cox and the Military Members of the Army Council. Onthe other hand, it would be equally serious for the War Cabinet toover-rule the advice given by the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief, India. There was no doubt of the need of more men, and he(the Prime Minister) was in full sympathy with the idea of enlistingnative forces in order to release white troops. The Prime minister had been impressed, by the view expressed by the Maharajah ofBikanir. The Maharajah had thought we missed a great oppor-tunity at the beginning of the War for recruiting native forces, andthat our refusal to recognise the officer class at that time hadsomewhat chilled the military enthusiasm of Indians. The PrimeMinister wished, to be assured that the opinion expressed by theCommander-in-Chief, India, was a military opinion, and what his view was of the effect of the proposals on the British Army in India.We must guard against ruining the prospects of the latter in orderto gain a purely temporary advantage.The War Cabinet were of opinion that, having regard to the unanimous opinion of their Military Advisers in this country, andthe views of experienced Indian Administrators who are membersof the War Cabinet, they could not reverse the deliberate decision reached on the previous day -without further information. They&apos;therefore decided (1.) To adhere to the decision recorded in the Minutes of theprevious day (War Cabinet 399, Minute 14).(2.) That Lord Islington should communicate this decision tothe Indian Government and should accompany it witha full exposition of the reasons on which it was based.The telegram giving these reasons should be concertedbetween the India Office and the Adjutant-General, onbehalf of the Army Council, and the telegram should beseen by the General Staff. Before final despatch itshould be shown to the Prime Minister. It should bemade clear to the Viceroy that the decision would not preclude the Government of India from asking theWar Cabinet to re-examine the question if, after receiving the reasons on which the War Cabinet hadbased their decision,theyshould wish to raise it again; butthat any request for such re-examination should be accompanied by a full statement of the reasons which led the Commander-in-Chief to reverse the opinionhe had expressed a year ago. It was particularly important that the Commander-in-Chief in India should deal with the military aspects of the question and should express his views on the following points : -(i.) The extent of the immediate military advantage,in the form of a real accession of fighting strength, that would be derived if his proposals were accepted,(ii.) Whether he considered that his proposals wouldmilitate against the efficiency of the indian army in the future by deterring a suitableclass of British officer from entering.(3.) In reply to the Viceroy&apos;s private telegram of the 25th April,Lord Islington should explain to the Viceroy that thedecision of the War Cabinet now being communicated to-him.was taken at a second sittting at which the Viceroy&apos;telegram stating that the proposal was put forward bythe Commander-in-Chief in India Avith a full sense ofresponsibility was considered.
sArms Traffic after 14. The War Cabinet had under consideration the report of athe War. Sub-Committee of the War Cabinet (Paper P. 13) dealing with thequestion of arms traffic after the war, together with a letter, datedthe 21st December, 1917, from the Government of India (paper g.T.-4043) giving their criticisms and suggestions on the report ofthe Sub-Committee.The War Cabinet remitted the question to Lord Curzon, and requested him to consult with the Departments concerned and to give a decision on behalf of the War Cabinet.Man-Power: 15. The Minister of Munitions stated that the Ministry wasVoluntary carrying out recruiting based on dilution, but that a certain amountRecruiting. of voluntary recruiting, which Avas actuated sometimes by thehighest motives, but often by a desire to join the technical units inthe field, was also taking place. If such were allowed to continueAvithout a check being placed upon it, this Avonld disorganise certain of the departments of the Ministry of Munitions which depended onhighly-skilled labour for their maximum production, and he AAdshed,if possible, that voluntary recruiting should be prohibited.The War Cabinet requested- Mr. Churchill to raise this question with the Minister of NationalService,The Forth-Clyde 16. With reference to War Cabinet 253, Minute 18, the WarCn-nal. Cabinet had under consideration a memorandum by the Minister of reconstruction (Paper GT.-4276) with regard to the proposal for a ship Canal connecting the Firth of Forth with the Clyde.Dr. Addison stated that he had considered the matter with allthe Departments concerned, and that the Admiralty held the viewthat such a canal by the Loch Lomond route would prove of great value in any future operations of Avar. Dr. Addison furthermentioned that, as regards the commercial value of the canal, itwas generally agreed that neither by the Loch Lomond route nor bythe direct route Avould the canal prove a paying proposition. Inorder that the Government, after the war, might be in a position toconsider fully the question of this canal, he recommended  &quot;(a.) The considerations advanced by the Admiralty are of aweighty nature, and I therefore recommend that anindependent detailed survey, Avith the necessarygeological surveys, be made for a canal capable of accommodating Avarships by the Loch Lomond route,with an extension for merchant ships to Dumbarton,the cost of this survey being roughly estimated at25,000Z. The Admiralty and Board of Trade shouldbe associated in arranging for the survey.&quot;&apos; (b.) A public enquiry should be held : &quot; (i.) To ascertain and report upon the commercialpossibilities of the Loch Lomond route, withthe commercial extension, and of a loAv-levelcanal by the direct route.(ii.) To advise whether the commercial possibilities ofthe direct route thus ascertained are such asto justify a similar survey being undertaken inrespect of this route at an additional costestimated at 25,000L&quot; (c.) If the public enqiury reports in the affirmative on(o) (ii) above, the survey suggested in (a) should beextended to the direct route.&quot;The Board of Trade and the Scottish Office shouldbe responsible for arranging the public enquirysuggested.&quot;
The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that he had receivedmany complaints that money was being spent which did not directly affect the prosecution of the war, and that as, in his opinion, the canal was not likely to be a commercial proposition, it would bedifficult to justify the expenditure of even 25,000!. at the presentmoment in connection with an undertaking which would not payafter the war when so much money would be required for other more profitable and necessary undertakings.The War Cabinet decided that The recommendations of the Minister of Reconstruction couldnot be proceeded with at the present time, but might beconsidered later, in conjunction with the proposals of theMinister of Reconstruction for the re-organisation of thewhole Canal System of the United Kingdom.Liquor Control. 17. With reference to War Cabinet 157, Minute 16, the Secretarydrew attention to War Cabinet Paper G.-201, containing the Reportsof the Liquor Trade Finance Committees for England and Wales,Scotland, and Ireland, together with a comparison of the Reportsprepared in the&apos;Home Office. The Secretary stated that he had beeninformed that the Reports were to be published as a ParliamentaryPaper.The War Cabinet authorised The Secretary to defer bringing the Reports up for discussion at the War Cabinet until after publication, and until the trend of public opinion had shown itself. ;2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.1V.,April 26, 1918.
fioAPPENDIX.India Office Memorandum on the Proposal of the Government of India to grant at once a large number of Temporary King&apos;s Commissions to Indians.1. IT is the unanimous opinion of military officers at the War Office and IndiaOffice that such a measure as is anticipated above cannot fail to have a very harmfuleffect upon the recruitment of British officers for the Indian army. The measures already taken in this direction have rendered parents and guardians and young menthemselves suspicious, and it is submitted that such a sudden and large measure as theabove would more than confirm their ideas on the subject. The Indian army in thepast has been able to obtain the best class of young officer. It is most important thatthis advantage shall not be surrendered.2. From a military point of view the measure does not seem necessary, as indian officers wuth commissions in the Native Indian Land Forces possess the same powersand functions, and can perform the same duties in the Indian army during the war as british officers of the Indian army.3. Attention should be drawn to the last four lines of paragraph 40, despatch no. 57 of the 3rd August, from the Government of India on the subject of King&apos;commissions. This despatch made proposals which do not go nearly as far as thepresent, and the last four lines run as follows&quot; Some may regard these proposals as conceding too much, others as not going far enough. The commander-iii-Chief is of opinion, however, that theymark the extreme limit to which we can with safety proceed ; in this opinion weentirety concur.&quot;Can it be said that a call by the Prime Minister for further effort on the part ofIndia has so completely altered the situation as to entirely cancel this solemn warninggiven by the Commander-in-Chief and the Government of India nine months ago?4. The measure appears to be a purely political one, and is only justifiable as suchif it can be certain that it will, especially under present circumstances, do the army no harm ; but, as aforesaid, military opinion at the War Office and at the India Office doesnot agree that this would be the case.The political effect of the proposal will be to secure the temporary service of thenoisy group of agitators who do not belong to the fighting classes of India, but to a racethat never has furnished, and is never likely to furnish, us with soldiers, a race which hasduring the last six months failed miserably to respond to the opening given them in theDefence Force of their own country and which lias no real influence on the fightingman-power of the Indian Empire, is it not somewhat to the point that the WarCabinet have in the last few days found it necessary to prohibit the visit of a partyrepresenting these very people to the British Isles ?5. The whole scheme for the grant of King&apos;s commissions to Indians is essentiallyone that should be proceeded with cautiously and step by step. The educationalmachinery for each step should be previously prepared, or risk of disaster is very great.Many former despatches and notes on the subject by great experts, including LordsRoberts and Curzon, bring this out very strongly. Yet it is demanded that this big-bound forward should be taken at the shortest notice, before any of the machinerynecessary for the deliberately constructed scheme is in existence a veritable leap inthe dark.o
