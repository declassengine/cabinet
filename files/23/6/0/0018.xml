THE First Sea Lord reported that British light forces operating in the Heligoland Bight on Saturday the 20th April hadbeen in touch with enemy light forces, who had retired behind theirminefields. One enemy destroyer had been hit, and one of our destroyers had been, hit, but we had received no casualties. All our ships had returned.Submarines.The WesternEront:2. The First Sea Lord reported that information had beenreceived from Gibraltar to the effect that an enemy submarine hadbeen sunk on the 21st April about 15 miles S.S.E. from Gibraltar.This was the first report of the sinking of an enemy submarine inthat locality.o. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported thatyesterday had been a quiet day on the Western front.Ypres. 4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that three enemy divisions were being moved up to Ypres.   One division was already in position there, and two others were on their way.[1365-396] B
Attention was drawn to the risk of the Ypres position beingturned by a heavy attack on the Belgians, who might, in spite oftheir recent successful action against German Landwehr, be over-whelmed, as the Portuguese were, by a more formidable attack by first line German troops, supported by heavy artillery concentration.Lord Curzon pointed out in this connection that the King ofthe Belgians was Commander-in-Chief of the Belgian arm;&apos;, and, byreason of his position, was not under the command of General Foch.It was, therefore, most desirable that the closest possible liaisonshould be established between General Foch and the King of the belgians.As a telegram on the subject had already been sent from theChief of the Imperial General Staff to General Foch, in the name ofthe War Cabinet, it was decided that No further action need be taken.Portuguese 5. With reference to War Cabinet 390, Minute 3, the Secretarykemtorcements. of state for Foreigll Affairs said that, from the Foreign Office pointof view, it was undesirable that the Portuguese Government shouldhave their ardour chilled by our refusal to have further Portuguesecontingents sent to France. From information received, it appeared that the recent Portuguese reverse on the Western front had resulted in greatly increased military enthusiasm in Portugal.Disposition of 6. With reference to War Cabinet 395, Minute 2, the Chief of enemy Divisions. the Imperial General Staff reported that about 130 german divisions had been used on the Western front, and, as some ofthese divisions had been in action more than once, there had therefore been an equivalent of 208 divisions used against theBritish and French. Of these, 151 had encountered British troops,and 57 had engaged the French. Thus it might be said that wehad had three German divisions attacking us for every one that had attacked the French. The Chief of the Imperial General staff said that this point had been brought to the attention of general foch.Co-operation of the 7. The War Cabinet had before them a telegram from LordUnited States of Beading, dated the 18th April, 1918, and another dated the 21stAmerica. April, 1918, in regard to American military co-operation.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that thematter in question was to be discussed with General Pershing thesame afternoon.&apos;The War Cabinet decided, that The matter should be postponed until after General Wilson&apos;binterview with General Pershing.March of UnitedStates troops through London.8. With reference to War Cabinet 395, Minute 5, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff reported that arrangements were being-made for a march of American troops through London.
Summary ofMilitarySituation :Man-Power.9. Attention was called to the following table of figures, giving a comparison of Allied and enemy strength on the Western front,contained in the current Weekly Summary by the General Staff: Army.	Divisions.	Battalions.	Rifle Strength.	Artillery (Field and Heavy.)British French American Belgian.. f Allies Total ^ [ Enemy	53 103 4 G	477 927 48 108	500,000 680,000 49,000 55,000	5,850 9,795 -   421 604    .	1GG 205	1,560 1,881	1,284,000 1,617,450	16,670 16,739The Prime Minister said that he had obtained for his speech inthe House of Commons on the 20th March the following figures : Allies ...Enemy...or an Allied superiority of as regards cavalry Allies ...Enemy...or an Allied superiority of as regards machine guns Allies ...enemy or an Allied superiority of1,418,000 bayonets1,402,0001(5,00084,000 sabres38,000   ,,46,000100,000 machine guns64,000      ,,     &apos;,,36,000Yet, in spite of these superiorities,  the General Staff Papershowed -German riffe strengthAllied rifle strengthor, in other words,   a   Germansuperiority of1,617,0001,284,000333,000The discrepancy was difficult to account for. While the Britishwere 6 divisions down, and the Portuguese 2 divisions down, theGermans were shown as being 18 up. From all the information received by the Cabinet, however, the German divisions appearedto be only 14 up. If the enemy were 14 divisions up and the Allieswere 8 divisions down, the result was only about 200,000 rifles infavour of the enemy. It must further be remembered that, since then, the Allied forces had been increased by 2 British divisions onfrom Italy, 1 division from Palestine, and 4 French divisions from italy, making a total of 7 Allied divisions, for which no creditappeared to be shown. In any case, the Weekly Summary appearedto be utterly inconsistent with the figures provided for the PrimeMinisters speech.The Secretary of State for War and the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff undertook to look into the matter.Inundations on the 10. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported thatWestern Front.        General Foch had asked for two brigades of Royal Marines to hold the points of passage across the inundations, which are being rapidlyextended.[1365-396] B2
The First Sea Lord notified the War Cabinet that the admiralty could not see their way to provide the two brigades for which general Foch asked.Russia. 11. The War Cabinet had under consideration a draft telegram to Mr. Lockhart (Appendix I (B)), prepared by the Foreign Office,in reply to Mr. Lockkart&apos;s telegram No. 96 of the 15th April, 1918(Appendix I (A) ).The War Cabinet approved the draft subject to the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs considering whether an alteration should be made in item 4, in order to securethat it did not imply that we were undertaking to recoverthe whole of the territory Russia had lost.Status of HisMajesty&apos;representatives inBrazil, Argentine,and Chile.12. The War Cabinet had before them a memoranchun byMr. Balfour (Paper G.T.-4258) proposing to raise the status of HisMajesty&apos;s representatives in Brazil, the Argentine, and Chile fromthat of Minister to Ambassador, and to receive Ambassadors fromthose three countries.The War Cabinet approved this proposal.The House ofLords.13.

5WG 396APPENDIX I (A).Mr. Lockhart to Mr. Balfour. (Received April 20.)(No. 96.) Moscow, April 15, 1918.FOLLOWING from Captain Garstin :-In view of Trotsky&apos;s request for a definite statement of terms on which allied intervention might be invited by Government of Soviets, Allied military representativesmet yesterday to formulate their opinions on this subject.We decided that following measures would be desirable: 1. Renewal of alliance with Russia.2. Guarantee not to interfere with Russian internal affairs.3. Loyal collaboration with Government of Soviets.4. Guarantee of integrity of Russian territory.5. Allies shall declare that operating forces will cross Siberia solely in order toreach war zone.6. Troops shall-be Allied and not only -Japanese.7. Russia shall be helped on Murman and Archangel railways.S. Co-operation shall be given to Armenia against Turks if desirable.APPENDIX I (B).Draft Telegram to Mr. Lockhart (Moscow).Foreign Office.YOUR telegram No. 96.I think suggestions of military representatives may well serve as a basis fordiscussion.As far as His Majesty&apos;s Government are concerned, 2, 4, and 6 can be accepted asthey stand. We have always considered Russia as our Ally, and word &quot; re-affirmation &quot;should therefore be substituted for &quot; renewal &quot; in 1.As 3 stands at present, it might in certain conceivable circumstances conflict with . I therefore prefer &quot;Loyal co-operation with Russian authorities against commonenemy.&quot;In order to give requisite military latitude, 5 should be amended as follows:&quot; Allies shall declare that operating forces will cross Siberia solely for the purpose ofcarrying out military operations against the enemy.&quot;If by help on Murman and Archangel railways aid given by ships and by marineslanded from them is meant, 7 can remain unchanged ; but employment of troops mustnecessarily be subject to military exigencies, as must also acceptance of 8. We are,however, most anxious to help in both cases.(Repeated to Tokio, Paris, Rome, and Washington.)
