THE First Sea Lord reported a successful attack by an armed trawler on an enemy submarine in the vicinity of Swanseaon the 27th April. He also stated that a telegram from Brindisireported that on the 26th April the Italian toipedo-boat &quot; Ardea &quot;claimed the probable sinking of a submarine. Admiral Wemyssalso stated that news had been received of the sinking of anothersubmarine, resulting in the capture of three officers and thirty-two men.The First Sea Lord said that during April there had been aconsiderable increase in the toll of enemy submarines. Thissuccess had been due to our better resources, and to the fact thatthe weather had been more in our favour. A total of eleven or moresubmarines had been sunk in the month of April alone..
Redistribution ofAllied naval forces in theMediterranean.2. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandumby the First Lord of the Admiralty (Paper G.T.-4393) on thesubject of &apos; the redistribution of Allied naval forces in theMediterranean.The First Sea Lord said that, at the third meeting of the allied naval Council, held in Paris on the 26/27th April, the Italianrepresentatives had not been in accord with the British and french representatives in regard to the transfer from Taranto to Corfu of italian dreadnoughts, and that therefore the conclusions of theAllied Naval Council had not been unanimous.The Prime Minister said that there would be an opportunity toraise this question at the forthcoming Meeting of the Supreme WarCouncil. It would be necessary to ask Signor Orlando to over-rulehis Naval Advisers, and therefore it would be very desirable thatthe First Sea Lord should make arrangements to be present at theMeeting.The Western Front:German Reserves.3. With reference to War Cabinet 398, Minute 1, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff reported that the Germans still had 15fresh divisions in reserve, and 25 other fresh divisions which couldbe used in roulement. These 40 divisions had never been in theline. In addition, 50 more divisions were refitting. The latest figures with regard to the French position were not available, but itwas probable that they had at least as many. During the fighting on the previous day between Bailleul and Boesinghe the germans had employed 13 divisions.Disposition of 4. With reference to War Cabinet 396, Minute 6, the Chief of enemy Divisions. the Imperial General Staff reported that 137 German divisions hadbeen engaged once ; 71 a second time ; 14 a third time ; and 1 a fourth time, making the equivalent of a total of 223 divisions. Ofthese, 131 had been used against us, 37 against the French, 55against both. This meant that we had had a total of about 160divisions against us as compared with 60 against the French.The Present 5. The Chief of the Imperial General  Staff  reported  that position. yesterday had been a very good day for the Allies.   The french had re-taken Locre, and had re-established themselves on the top of the high ground there. General Wilson also reported thatScherpenberg was still in our possession, and that the line now ranhalf-way between Scherpenberg and Kemmel. Round Ypres, our line now ran along the Canal, with outposts beyond. Asked as towhether Y&apos;pres was tenable, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff( said that he did not think Ypres would remain tenable if the enemytook Scherpenberg. He was doubtful now if we should re-takeKemmel; to re-capture it would involve a big operation, and he did not know whether General Foch intended to attempt it. In -anycase, the possession of Kemmel by the enemy enabled him toenfilade Ypres. The actual decision as to withdrawal from Ypreswas a matter for General Foch.After some discussion as to the comparative loss of men by either attempting to re-capture Kemmel or remaining at Y7pres, theChief of the Imperial General Staff said that he would talk thematter over with General Foch.The Channel Ports. 6. The Secretary of State for War reported that information had been received that the German General Headquarters, having-recognised that it was impossible to break through further South,were now making a powerful effort to obtain the Channel ports,with the object, inter alia, of using Calais as a submarine base.
n .171Censorship of letters fromAustralian Troopsin Prance.7. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff drew attention to information from General Headquarters to the effect that scurrilousand unfair allusions to the conduct of British troops were being-made in letters written by Australians serving on the western front. In view of the impossibility of stopping these letters beingposted; it was considered advisable that action should be taken immediately with the Australian Government to deal with thisquestion, but at the same time it was considered that more definite information was desirable as to the nature of the statements con-tained in these letters.The question arose as to what steps were taken in order thatthe Dominion press should receive information of the fighting ofBritish troops, and it was agreed that it would be desirable forfuller information on this subject to lie made available for publica-tion in the Dominions.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Secretary of State for the Colonies should telegraph tothe Governor-General of Australia requesting him totake appropriate action in Australia.(6.) The Chief of the Imperial General. Staff should obtainmore definite information as to the nature of the state-ments made in these letters for the information of theWar Cabinet and the Secretary of State for the Colonies,and such action as the latter may consider desirable.(c.) The Minister of Information should be requested to send tothe Dominions the necessary information with regard tothe fighting performances of British troops for publication in the Dominion press.Co-operation ofthe United Statesof America:Supplies for american Troops.8. With reference to War Cabinet 398, Minute 2, Mr. Chamberlaincalled attention to telegram No. B 5, from the British military representative at Washington, in regard to the supply of food andmaterial for American &apos; troops in France. He stated that theShipping- Controller had expressed his anxiety on this question, andenquired if a general undertaking had been given that all american troops should be supplied from British sources.The Secretary of State for War pointed out that the only Britishobligation was to feed and supply those American troops who were fighting under command of Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig.It wras agreed that the telegram as worded was not sufficientlyexplicit, and might lead to misunderstandings.The War Cabinet requested The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to send a telegram toLord Reading, making it clear that the troops undercommand of Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig would be fedand supplied from British sources, but that all otherAmerican troops in France should be supplied from american sources.Employment of With reference to War Cabinet 341, Minute 11, the WarCzech Troops. Cabinet had under consideration a telegraphic report of Joint note no. 25 by the Military Representatives at Versailles (Paper G.T.-4379)on the subject of the transportation from Russia of Czech troops.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs called attention to telegram No. 114 from Mr. Lockhart, which stated that these troopsIn this connection the Chief of the Imperial General Staff saidthat the Germans were sending, eighteen trainloads of pontoons forthe purpose of coping with the inundations.
were being sent to Murmansk, wbile the Secretary of State for Warstated that he had just received a later telegram which statedthat 6,000 of these troops had already arrived at Vladivostock,and that the remainder were on the way. Lord Milner also statedthat, according to French military information, there were altogether45,000 of these troops available, forming two good divisions, whowere anxious to come and fight in France. They had been collected in the neighbourhood of Omsk, and it was not then decided whetherthey should go to Murmansk or Vlaclivostock ; but, in view of thefact that they were now apparently arriving at the latter port, thequestion arose as to how their transport could be arranged in orderthat they might be brought to France.It was pointed out that the original arrangement with M. Trotzkiwas that these troops should be used to defend the Russian ports,and that a very different situation arose if it was intended to make use of Czech troops to fight in France against the Germans.A suggestion was put forward that it would be advisable thatthese troops should be used for an Allied enterprise from Siberia,but the opinion was expressed that the desire of these men. as to where they wished to fight, must be taken into consideration.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) This question should be dismissed at the forthcoming meet-ing of the Supreme War Council.(b.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretaryof State for War should prepare a memorandum for theinformation of the members of the War Cabinet attending the Supreme War Council, after collating the telegrams which had been received on this subject.Economic- 10. Mr. Chamberlain drew the attention of the War Cabinet toOffensive. telegram No. 558 from Paris, in which it was stated that, accordingto newspaper reports, the French Cabinet had decided to denounceall commercial conventions containing a most-favoured-natiou clause,or tariff agreements, as well as arrangements relating to maritimecommerce, and any others likely to interfere with the conclusion ofany new commercial, maritime, or customs system. Mr. Chamberlainasked whether any corresponding action was contemplated by theBritish Government.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said, that the question had been considered by the Committee on the Trade Relations ofthe United Kingdom within the Empire, and their recommendationshad been approved by the War Cabinet and had received theconcurrence of the Dominion Governments. He was under theimpression that the necessary action was about to be taken.Mr. Walter Long undertook to enquire how the matter stood.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,April 30, 1918.
