1. The Director of Military Operations reported that there wasno change in the situation on the Western front. The tendency ofthe information received was towards an attack against the Illrdand Ivth  Armies, somewhere between Arras and Amiens. Therewas also an enemy concentration in the Ypres region, as had beenreported on the previous day (War Cabinet 396, Minute 4).2. The First Sea Lord reported that a naval raid had beencarried, out against Zeebrugge and Ostend on the previous night,with the object of blocking those harbours, which were used by theenemy as destroyer and submarine bases. The attack had beenprepared for a long time, and on one occasion the ships to been gaged had actually set sail. The operation, however, required an exceptional combination of weather conditions, light, wind, and tide,and it had had to be abandoned. The operation included arrange-menls for the obsolete cruiser &quot; Vindictive &quot; and two Liverpoolferry-boats, the &quot;Iris&quot; and the &quot; Daffodil,&quot; full of troops, to goalongside the Mole, with a landing-party, with the object of destroying everything found there. The &quot; Vindictive&quot; had beenalongside the Mole for one hour, and had actually returned. Fiveobsolete cruisers were used as block-ships, filled with concrete, andwere sunk by design. At Zeebrugge, two of these block-ships were sunk in their proper place. At Ostend, it Avas understoodthat the block-ships had not been sunk in the intended placebecause they had grounded before they reached there. Two oldsubmarines, full of explosives, had been used to make a gap in thepile-work at the root of the mole. The Vice-Admiral, Dover, had reported that the operation was completed. He had come intoDover, and all. his destroyers and light forces, together with manymotor-boats that had been used for smoke-screen purposes, weresafely back. A barrage of fog had been put out, with the most successful results, which had enabled the operations to be carriedout. The whole exploit had taken place in the dark, without lights.Mo aerial bombardment, by way of assistance, had been possible,owing to rain and mist.With regard to casualties, the First Sea Lord reported that, outof the block-ships, I officer and GO men had not yet been accountedfor. No news had been received of the block-ship &quot; Thetis.&quot; Itwas supposed that our casualties amounted to about 400.The Prime Minister said that this naval raid had been a verytine performance ; it was a well-conceived plan, carried, out withgreat nerve and precision, and every credit must be given to admiral Iveyes and the officers and men who had taken part in theoperation.With reference to publishing the news, the First Lord said that,in order to forestall the Germans, who would probably say that theyhad sunk five British cruisers, he had sent a notice to the press, forinsertion in the early editions of the evening papers, instead ofmaking an announcement in the House of Commons, to the effectthat the five cruisers had been sunk by design.As regards sending their congratulations to the Yice-Admiral,Dover, the War Cabinet decided : To wait until the following day, by which time fuller reportswill have been received.3. The Prime Minister, on behalf of the War Cabinet,congratulated the Chancellor of the Exchequer upon the success ofhis speech in the House of Commons on the previous day, and the favourable reception accorded to his Budget proposals.
* The Secretary is in communication with Sir Sam Fay on the subject, and willnotify the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in clue course.Co-operation ofthe United Statesof America.4. With reference to War Cabinet No. 396, Minute 7, theSecretary of State for War reported that a long discussion on thesubject of American military co-operation had been held withGeneral Pershing and his Chief of Staff. The old points had been raised, but final conclusions had not been reached, and a further meeting was to take place that afternoon at 4 o&apos;clock.The Director of Military Operations reported that there were atpresent in France 11,700 American troops (infantry and machine-guns) for attachment to the British armies. Under General Pershingin France there were 389,000 troops of all kinds,. Of these, however,there were only about 100,000 fighting men, of which it might besaid that 60,000 were infantry.With reference to a memorandum by Secretary Baker, theterms of which had been communicated in Lord Reading&apos;s telegram,dated the 21st April, 1918, the attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to a subsequent telegram from Lord Beading, dated the22nd April, saying: &quot;I very earnestly hope that you will not askme to raise any objection to memorandum of which I sent you testyesterday.&quot; A further message had been received from lord reading on the 22nd April, to the effect that Colonel House stronglyadvised that the &quot;document should be accepted, not only without raising any objection, but also without having any in mind.&quot;The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that, ondiplomatic grounds, it was most desirable that the memorandum inquestion should be accepted.The War Cabinet decided that -The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should telegraph toLord Reading, authorising him to accept the memorandum,and adding that the details of the matter were now being discussed by the War Office with General Pershing, inLondon.Belgian Railway 5. The War Cabinet had. before them Joint Note No. 23, by theResources. Military Representatives of the Supreme War Council, in regard tothe utilisation of Belgian railway resources. This paper showed that there were 200 Belgian main line locomotives, with crews, inworkable condition, which were not performing any useful purposeat the moment, and 5,847 skilled railway men in the Belgian army(not in railway units). The Military. Representatives stronglyrecommended that the 200 locomotives, with their crews, should beobtained from the Belgian Government and placed at the disposal ofthe Allies, and that the release from the Belgian army of theapproximately 6,000 skilled railwaymen should be obtained.The War Cabinet were of opinion that pressure should be put upon the Belgian Government to carry out the recommendations ofthe Military Representatives oi the Supreme War Council.General Smuts pointed out that, on a previous occasion when we had drawn upon the resources of Belgian rolling-stock, we had given a distinct promise that replacement should be made after thewar, and that this point should be represented to the BelgianGovernment.The War Cabinet, in approving the recommendations of theMilitary Representatives contained in Joint Note 23, decidedthat The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should make representations to the Belgian Government in accordancewith the recommendations contained in Joint Note 23,and at the same time should ask the French Governmentto make similar representations. As regards replacement of Belgian railway material, it was decided to followprecedent in the matter. *
Ireland:ApplicationMilitary SerAct.MilitaryPrecautions.6. With reference to War Cabinet 392, Minute 12, the war of the     Cabinet had before them, a Report by Field-Marshal Lord French,vice       in regard to the situation of affairs in Ireland, and the dispositions.  which bad been made by him, in co-operation with the head of theRoyal Irish Constabulary and the Chief Commissioner for Dublin,in view of the possibility of opposition to the enforcement of theAct in Ireland (Paper No. 22/B/12).The Prime Minister stated that, from information which he hadreceived from Field-Marshal Lord French, it appeared that, whilethe situation was undoubtedly menacing, Lord French was ofopinion that, although the application of the Act to Ireland would&apos; not be easy, yet he still felt certain, as he had previously informed the War Cabinet, that he would be able to enforce it. On the otherhand, Sir Bryan Mahon, in spite of the statement which he had previously made to the War Cabinet, was not so sanguine as toresults.The Chief Secretary for Ireland said that he had received areport in connection with the consultation which had been held in dublin between Colonel MacLean, representing the War Office, theGeneral   Officer   Commanding-in-Chief, General   Byrne  and  theChief Commissioner of the Dublin Police, which stated that it was proposed to call up for service all men under 23 years of age, andthat seventy-three military tribunals were to be established inIreland.   Mr. Duke had not himself seen the scheme, but his information, received from the police, was to the effect that it couldnot be successfully put into operation.   Mr. Duke also readfurther report from the Under Secretary for Ireland, which stated,that the Under-Secretary understood that the proposed scheme wasto he put into operation without any delay.   In view of the factthat  proposals  such  as   these   must  x^ercolate  throughout  thecountry and hasten preparations to resist conscription, Mr. Dukeexpressed the opinion that the setting up of the machinery toapply the Act to Ireland would precipitate the day -when, owing to opposition, it would be necessary to put troops in control of the island.   Both the Head of the Royal Irish Constabulary and theChief  Commissioner for Dublin expressed  grave  fears that the bishops would  induce the young Roman Catholic policemen towithdraw from giving any assistance in enforcing the Act, and thatto replace these policemen by police from England would be useless.Mr. Duke further stated that a manifesto had been issued yesterday,signed by seventeen King&apos;s Counsel, including a number of Public-Prosecutors, and by two Sergeants of Law, approving the declarationof the Catholic hierarchy to oppose conscription.   The Departmentof Agriculture in Ireland had also been receiving notices from theirInspectors to the effect that the farmers would  stop tillage andthreaten to plough up crops already sown.   Mr. Duke also reportedthat he had received information that the civilian coast-watchers on. the southern and western coasts had withdrawn from their duties, asa protest against conscription.Mr. Barnes expressed the opinion that it was inadvisable toptublish the details of the machinery which was to be set up, in viewof the fact that such publication would necessarily stop anyvoluntary recruiting, and would probably inflame the people.General Shaw stated that he had received information from ireland that at 12 midnight last night a general strike of all labour had taken place, which, it was anticipated, wotdd terminate atVI midnight to-night. All trains had ceased to run, except those on 1the Great Northern Railway. Mails for all parts of Ireland, except those served by that Railway, would not be delivered ; but, so faras he had been able to ascertain, only one troop train had been held up.    No reports of any disturbances had been received.With reference to the steps taken in connection with the setting-up of machinery to apply the Act, the Adjutant-General stated thathe had been in consultation with the Minister of National Service
Home Rule :Government ofIrelandAmendment Bill.7. With reference to AVar Cabinet 392, Minute 1-3, the WarCabinet had before them a letter addressed by Mr. Long to thePrime Minister, dated the 18th April, 1918 (Paper G.T.-4310).Mr. Long stated that there was considerable and increasingevidence to show that, if a beginning could be made with theestablishment of a Federal system for the United Kingdom, it wouldbe much easier to pass the Government of Ireland Amendment bill through the House of Commons. He was receiving many represen-tations daily in favour of a Federal solution from liberals and fromUnionists. The Nationalists wanted the control of Customs and excise. The people, of Ulster were not prepared to negotiate at all,and they held that they had been unfairly treated on the Convention.An encouraging feature, however, emerged from the reports of theConvention, which showed that barriers had been broken down overa variety of questions which, in former days, would have dividedIrishmen on the old party lines. He did not believe that it wouldbe possible to pass a Home Pule Bill through the House of Commonsunless it could be shown that it was not inconsistent with Federalism.He thought, further, that, having regard to the immense burden of post-war legislation which wotdcl rest upon Parliament, some Federalplan was inevitable. Such a solution would greatly help to makeHome Rule tolerable to Unionists, to the Ulster people, and more acceptable even to the Nationalists. It would be very difficult forIrishmen tcoppose measures which it was intended to make applic-able to each of the four parts of. the United Kingdom. some members of the House of Lords would regard the Federal proposal as a very serious step. It was also prophesied that the IrishNationalist members would not attend Parliament while the Bill[1365-397]c5 &apos; WC 397on the subject, and had drawn up a plan, which they proposed to lay before the War Cabinet, a draft of which he hoped to haveready for submission to the Secretary of State for War to-morrowmorning. No steps had been taken by him or Sir Auckland Geddesin this matter, except to send over Colonel MacLean to Ireland witha draft of the proposals, marked &quot; Secret,&quot; to Sir Bryan Mahon, andnothing could possibly be clone with regard to recruiting under theAct in Ireland for another three weeks^ General Macreacly was ofopinion that the difficulties which would be encountered wouldprobably be passive rather than active, pointing out that in thiscountry no less than 623 men had adopted that attitude. If suchaction were taken by the Irish in order to avoid the Act, GeneralMacready gave it as his opinion that these men should be treated assoldiers and tried by general court-martial as such. He explainedthat we had never exercised in Great Britain the full power ofMilitary Law with regard to Conscientious Objectors.It was pointed out that the Government were only makingpreparations to carry out a declared policy, that the Act could notbe put into operation without an Order in Council. The opinion was also expressed, in view of the reports which had been sent tothe Department of Agriculture in Ireland, that whereas a supply of oats and livestock undoubtedly came from Ireland, yet GreatBritain shipped there large quantities of tea, wheat, and coal, andthat the balance of tonnage was in favour of Great Britain.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The President of the Board of Trade and the Minister ofShipping should investigate the amount of foodstuffsimported from and exported to Ireland, and lay a report-on this question before the War Cabinet.(6.) In view of the statement made to the War Cabinet byMr. Duke, the First Lord of the Admiralty should reportto the War Cabinet in regard to the reliability attachedby the Admiralty to their coast-watchers in Ireland.
was under discussion. He doubted that. A resolution couldbe moved from one side of the House and seconded from theother in support of the Federal principle, and of the appoint-ment of a Committee to consider its application to England,Scotland, and Wales ; while in the preamble to the Home Rule Bill,and also in some of its clauses, there could be references to theGovernments intention to set up national legislatures, not only inIreland, but in England, Scotland, and Wales.The Prime Minister suggested that the Cabinet could lay it down as a principle that the Irish Bill must be compatible with a federal scheme, and provision could be made for setting up aCommission on the lines of the Speakers Conference. He had alwaysfound that the Ulster representatives objected to being treateddifferently from the United Kingdom, but if a scheme were projectedin which Ireland would appear as much an integral part of theUnited Kingdom as England, Scotland, and Wales, that would goa long way to placate Ulster. As regards Wales, there were severalproblems which &quot;Welshmen would like to handle themselves, and fordealing, with which the Imperial Parliament never found adequatetime. Had Wales enjoyed Home Rule, he believed greater progress would have been made, especially with education. .He was assured by representative Scotsmen that the same feeling of the present parliament being congested prevailed, and there was a growingdesire that Scottish affairs should be managed by Scotsmen. Hewould not, however, make the passage of the Home Rule Billdependent on the acceptance of a general scheme of Federalism.Mr. Chamberlain thought it essential to obtain a decision from parliament in favour of the Federal principle, because otherwise itwould be impossible to obtain sufficient Unionist support for theIrish Bill ; secondly, because of the congestion of business after the war, and the strain which would be. thrown on the imperial parliament ; and, thirdly, because Federalism provided a solution for problems like Customs, which were otherwise extraordinarilydifficult. He therefore wished it to appear plainly on the face ofthe Irish Bill that it was the first instalment of a Federal schemefor the United Kingdom.Mr. Barnes urged that, as already decided by the Cabinet, theConvention^ Majority Report should form the basis of the Bill. Ithad obtained a certain measure of agreement. The Nationalists nowfeared that the Government were cunningly devising a new schemewhich they would be forced to reject, and that the Government wasdoi ng this so as to put the Nationalists in the wrong in the eyes oftheir countrymen and of the world at large. He wanted to be assured that the Federal proposals were not inconsistent with a Billbased on the Convention Report. If the Government travelledoutside that Report, it would give rise to suspicion and fresh con-troversy. The decision of the Convention to postpone the considera-tion of Customs and Excise was not inconsistent with a FederalBill.Mr. Long agreed that a Federal Bill and&apos;the Convention report were not inconsistent, but a number of important issues would haveto be dealt with in the Bill, which had not been faced by theConvention. It was true that the majority had excluded customs and Lxcise for the present, but he understood that this conclusionhad been obtained by a very narrow margin of votes, perhaps forthe purpose of keeping the Convention together, rather than on merits, and that the majority really would have preferred to retain control of Excise.The Prime Minister reminded the Cabinet that, in their letter of25th February, 1918, addressed to the Convention, a suggestion hadbeen made that, &quot; at the end of the war a Royal Commission shouldbe established to re-examine impartially and thoroughly the financial relations of Great Britain and Ireland, to report on the contribution of Ireland to Imperial expenditure, and to submit proposals as to
the best means of adjusting the economic and fiscal relations of thetwo countries.&quot;General Smuts said that in the Cabinet&apos;s letter to the Conventionit had been suggested that, during the period of the war, and for aperiod of two years thereafter, the control of Customs and Exciseshould be reserved to the United Kingdom Parliament. Thissuggestion was accepted by the Convention by a small majority.He urged that the Cabinet should follow in the Bill the policyindicated in their own letter, otherwise they would be charged witha breach of faith, and they would force the Nationalists to rejectany other treatment of the problem less favourable to their point ofview. He himself could not conceive of the Imperial Parliamentsurrendering the control of Customs when a general Federal schemewas adopted. He believed the Government was absolutely safe inpostponing the question, as suggested by the Majority Report.Mr. Chamberlain said that he had suggested to the Committeea clause withholding Customs and Excise for the present, butagreeing to the extension of their control to Ireland if and wheneversuch control was granted to the National Parliaments of England,Scotland, and Wales.Mr. Baifour agreed with Mr. Barnes that the Irish Bill must bea Convention Bill, that is, it should embody the recommendationsagreed to by a majority of the Convention, and should, therefore,exclude Customs and Excise for seven years, when the matter should come up for reconsideration. He had been againstdealing with. Home Rule at all during the war, but had cometo the conclusion that it had to be dealt with now as a warmeasure. For that reason a great deal was to be gained byadhering clearly to the Convention Report. Further, theBill had to be looked, at as a war measure, in the fate ofwhich the self-governing dominions and the United States wereprofoundly concerned, inasmuch as they were all united with us inthe prosecution of the war. So far he was prepared to go, but hewas most reluctant to be committed beyond that position and to aceptance of a Federal system. It might be the case that therewas a growing body of opinion in favour of Federalism, but hethought the question had received a very imperfect consideration.The Federal solution had been found admirable in great countries as an integrating force binding widely scattered regions into aunity, but in a small country like ours there were neither historicalnor geographical reasons for introducing the Federal plan. Englandformed by far the largest fraction of this Kingdom, and he thoughtthat an English Parliament and a Federal Parliament in london would be quite unworkable. With regard to the congestion ofbusiness at the centre, the Federal solution would postpone recon-strnotion problems indefinitely, because the country, immediatelyafter the war, would be plunged into acute controversy on constitu-tional issues in the attempt to evolve a Federal scheme applicableto the different parts of the Kingdom. He was prepared to support a war scheme, but he hoped he would not be committed to a federal scheme all round.Dr. Adclison thought there was very little in the recommenda-tions of the Convention ultimately inconsistent with a federal scheme, and he would not object to some provisional words beinginserted in the Irish Bill, such as &quot; in the event of the adoption ofa Federal scheme.&quot; He was most anxious to avoid any delay in introducing the Home Rule Bill. He favoured the adoption of aConvention Report on the question of Customs and Excise ; wouldmake the Irish Bill as consistent as possible with Federalism ; andwould provide for the appointment of a Commission of Enquiry ona Federal scheme for England, Scotland, and Wales. He urgedthat, nothing should be done to kindle a big controversy onFederalism in general at this stage.Mr. Long was certain that the adoption of Federalism was theonly chance of appeasing Ulster. If anything, opinion in Ulsterhad hardened during the last few weeks.   They were not satisfied[1365-397] D
by the promised safeguard of an Ulster Committee or fuller repre-sentation. They felt betrayed by the Southern Unionists, and were holding out threats of a strike in the shipyards if a Home Rule bill were forced through.Lord Curzon said that the Cabinet were being asked to agreeto a novel constitutional procedure. He agreed with Mr. Balfourthat it would be extraordinarily difficult to adjust the spheres and duties of an Imperial Parliament and an English Parliament. TheCabinet were apparently being asked to pledge themselves toFederalism chiefly in order to extricate themselves out of theirpresent Irish difficulties. He would prefer that the Bill should proceed on the basis already agreed upon, namely, the ConventionReport and the Prime Ministers letter to the Convention. He was prepared to go further, and to omit from the Bill all that was inconsistent with Federalism, and to add what would help thepassage of the Bill. Pie did not think it necessary to bringFederalism into the preamble, and was not opposed to a Commissionof Enquiry ; but the prompt passage of the Irish Bill was, in hisopinion, of supreme importance at this juncture.Mr. Bonar Law suggested that, in the light of the Auews that had been expressed, it would be better for the Cabinet to have before them a draft of the Bill, with a preamble on the lines indicated by Mr. Long. On the question of Federalism he was ingeneral agreement with Mr. Balfour, but the Cabinet had now toconsider how most effectively to placate Ulster. The objection toFederalism was the difficulty of securiug under it a real imperial parliament.Mr. Long agreed to produce a draft Bill as requested, butwarned the Cabinet that he might be unable to support the Bill inthe shape in which it finally emerged.The Prime Minister agreed with the demand for promptitudein dealing with the Irish situation. It would be impossible toproceed with conscription until Home Rule had been dealt with.The Irish situation to-day raised the biggest constitutional issue onwdiich Parliament had been divided for oO or 40 years : the realsupremacy of the Imperial Parliament. The Irish Nationalists atthe present moment were challenging the right of the imperial parliament to impose upon them an Act which they dislike. Thatwas a challenge to the unity of the Kingdom. Whether the cabinet had been right in raising the issue at&apos;this time was questionable,but now the issue had been raised it had to be boldly faced. It was important, therefore, to make the situation as favourable as possiblefor the Cabinet to engage upon such a conflict. The Cabinet shouldbe in a position to say : These domestic issues we hand over to yon,but conscription we mean to enforce.&quot; It was a big issue, and itwas the one which had divided the Northern and the SouthernStates. Until Home Rule was carried through Parliament, theGovernment would not be in a good strategical position for enforcing the Military Service Act in Ireland. Once the conflict was over, he believed Irishmen would settle clownMr. Balfour expressed full concurrence in this view.Mr. Herbert Fisher said that he had discussed the Irish situation with Lord Southborough, who took a not unhopeful view. Accordingto Lord South borough, the Nationalist Party in the Convention hadbeen prepared to make very generous concessions to Ulster, if onlyUlster would come in and co-operate. If a Bill could be producedembodying the majority proposals of the Convention, Lord South-borough believed that the Nationalists would consent to anyguarantees asked for by Ulster, provided Ulster came into the IrishParliament.The &quot;War Cabinet decided To adjourn the discussion until they had an opportunity of considering the draft Bill, now i course of preparation byMr. Long&apos;s Committee.
The WesternPront:Extension of theBritish Line.9. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that his attention had been drawn to articles in certain newspaperssuggesting that the recent reverse of the Vth Army was due to theGovernment having forced Field-Marshal Sir Douglas tlaig toextend, his line unduly. A question on these lines had been jrat byMr. George Lambert in the House of Commons for that afternoon.He had accordingly instructed the Secretary of the War Cabinet tofurnish him with the Proceedings of the War Cabinet and of theInternational Conference on this subject. Pie had very carefullystudied these Proceedings, and it was quite clear that the question had invariably been left for decision between the Commanders-in-Chief of the British and French Armies ; that no pressure had beenput on Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Iiaig to comply with the Frenchdemands ; and that, whenever the subject had been discussed withrepresentatives of the French Government, the British representatives had invariably put the views of the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff and the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief with the utmostforce. He felt that the time was approaching when it might benecessary to make a full statement in the House of Commons on thesubject.After a short discussion, in the course of which attention was drawn to the undesirability of discussing the question at any length in the absence of the Secretary of State for &quot;War, Avho had had toto leave the Meeting earlier, the War Cabinet agreed that Mr. LamberFs question did not afford a. convenient opportunityfor a full statement, and that a reply should be given inthe sense that there was not the smallest justification forthe suggestion that this portion of the line was taken over contrary to the judgment of Sir William Robertsonand Sir Douglas Haig ; the arrangements in the matter were made entirely by the British and French militaryauthorities.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,April 23, 191S.oMan-Power : 8. The War Cabinet took note of the Proclamation, preparedMilitary Service by the Minister of National Service, for calling up men born in theAits, 1916-1918.     years 1874-75 (Paper O.T.-4305).
