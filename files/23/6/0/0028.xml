Attention was called to telegram No. 1433 from Christiania,which stated that the German Military Attaches to neutral countries had received orders to he sent to the Western front on the11th instant. It was pointed out that these directions probablyindicated the date of the nest offensive, as a similar course had beentaken before the start of the German offensive on the 21st March.Submarines. 2. The   Deputy First  Sea  Lord reported  that  the   drifter&quot; Smilax,&quot; when 14 miles west of St. David&apos;s Head, had heard, bymeans of the hydrophone, a submarine, which, ultimately showed aperiscope 100 yards from the ship. Two depth charges were dropped, and, after the second, the submarine was apparentlybrought to the surface and appeared to roll over. A third depthcharge was then dropped, and a violent explosion occurred, after which oil and air bubbles came to the surface.
Ireland. 3. With reference to War Cabinet 368, Minute 16, attention was called to the fact that the decisions of the War Cabinet callingWeekly Reports.      on t]le Chief Secretary for Ireland to render weekly reports as tothe condition of affairs in Ireland had not been strictly adhered to.Reference was made to two important telegrams..... one from theForeign Office to the Vatican (No. -14), and one from (die ForeignOffice to Lord Reading (No..2571) on the subject of Ireland, theimport of which had not previously been known to the WarCabinet.Lord Curzon pointed out that questions about Ireland were. apt to be raised in the House of Lords on subjects as to which hewas not fully informed, and suggested that it was very advisable that the Secretary for Ireland, particularly at the present juncture,should render, for the information of the War Cabinet, a full weekly report of the position.The Prime Minister said that he had, in conversation withField-Marshal Lord French, learned from him that he was preparedto take every step possible to put a stop to any German intrigues,and also that lie had expressed the opinion that it would, be advisable to appoint General Byrne, the Head of the Royal irish constabulary, as Dncler-Secretary for Ireland.It was generally agreed that, if possible, Lord French should attend the War Cabinet on the following morning, before proceeding to Ireland to take up his duties, in order to lay before the Cabinetthe steps which he proposed to take in Ireland.Attention was also called to a memorandum written&apos;by the attorney-General for Ireland on the subject of the present state ofthat island.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The memorandum by the Attorney-General for ireland should be circulated forthwith.(b.) The Viceroy of Ireland should be asked to forward a weekly report as to the state of Ireland, through theChief Secretary, for the information of the War Cabinet.Home Rufe Bill. 4. With reference to War Cabinet 397, Minute 7, Lord Curzoncalled, attention to the fact that he, with Mr. Barnes and general smuts, were . appointed by. the War Cabinet members of theCommittee to draw up the Home Rule Bill, but that, after onesitting of this Committee, he had not been summoned to attend anyfurther meetings.It was pointed out that the Secretary of State for the Colonies,who was the Chairman of the Committee, had received instructions from the War Cabinet (War Cabinet 392, Minute 13), to draw upthe draft of the Bill himself, and to call the Committee togetherwhen he considered it desirable.Mr. Chamberlain said that, as he understood the position,Mr. Long had asked one or two colleagues to help him to make thedraft. This Sub-Committee had met again that morning. A new draft Bill was being printed, and would be circulated to the fullCommittee. It was intended to summon the Committee to meeton Thursday afternoon next, to consider the Bill apart from finance,as the finance clauses of the Bill could not be settled until theChancellor of the Exchequer was prepared to discuss the finance ofthe scheme with the Committee. In answer to questions, Mr.Chamberlain stated that the Ministers engaged in drafting the bill were Mr. Walter Long, Sir George Cave. Mr. II. A. L. Fisher, and himself. Some changes had been made in the former draft, whichhad been circulated to members of the Committee. He deprecatedany discussion of the Bill in the Cabinet till it had been before thefull Committee.The Prime Minister said that he had received on the previous
WC 406day a remarkable deputation from the Trades Unionists of Belfast,to whom lie had pointed out that it was impossible to enforceconscription in Ireland without some reasonable measure of home rule. He had also shown them how the supremacy of parliament had been challenged by the action of the Catholic hierarchy, and how important it was that they should render him every assistancein their power in order to defeat this challenge which had been thrown down. Mr. Lloyd George had asked the deputation to putforward some practical suggestions as to the Bill, which the membersof the deputation had promised to do, and to come and discuss suchsuggestions with him.General Maurice&apos;s 5. The War Cabinet had under consideration  the following-Letter to the Press, letter, which had appeared in the press that morning, from Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice, who had until quite recently held the position of Director of Military Operations at the War Office : &quot; Sir,&quot;My attention has been called.to answers given in theHouse of Commons on the 23rd April by Mr. Bonar Law to questions put by Mr. G. Lambert, Colonel Burn, and Mr. Pringleas to the extension of - the British front in France (Hansard,Vol. 105, No. 34, p. 815). These answers contain certainmisstatements which in sum give a totally misleading impression of what occurred. This is not the place to enterinto a discussion as to all the facts, but Hansard&apos;s report of the incident concludes :  &quot; &apos; Mr. Pringle, Was this matter entered into at the versailles War Council at any time ? &apos;&quot; &apos; Mr. Bonar Law, This particular matter was notdealt with at all by the Versailles War Comicil.&apos;&quot; I was at Versailles when the question was decided by theSupreme War Council, to whom it had been referred.&quot; This is the latest of a series of misstatements which havebeen made recently in the House of Commons by the present government.   ( hi the. 9th April the Prime Minister said : &quot; &apos; What was- the position at the beginning of the battle ? Notwithstanding the heavy casualties in 1917,the army in France was considerably stronger on the1st January, 1918, than on the 1st January, 1917.&apos;(Hansard, Vol. 104, No. 24, p. 1328).&quot; That statement implies that Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s fighting strength, on the eve of the great battle which began on the 21stMarch had not been diminished.&quot; That is not correct,&quot; Again, in the same speech the Prime Minister said : &quot; &apos; In Mesopotamia there is only one white division atall, in Egypt and in Palestine there are only three whitedivisions, the rest are Indians or mixed with a veiy, verysmall proportion of British troopis in those divisions I amreferring to the infantry divisions.&apos;&quot; This is not correct.&apos;&apos; Now, Sir, this letter is not the result of a militaryconspiracy. It has been seen by no soldier. 1. am by descentand conviction as sincere a democrat as the Prime Minister, andthe last thing I want is to see the Government of our country inthe hands of soldiers. My reasons for taking the very gravestep of writing this letter are that the statements quoted above
are known to a large number of soldiers to be incorrect, andthis knowledge is breeding such distrust of the Government as can only end in impairing the splendid moral of our troops at atime when everything possible should be clone to raise it.&quot; I have therefore decided, fully realising the consequenceto myself, that my duty as a citizen must override my duty asa soldier, and I ask you to publish this letter in the hope that parliament may see fit to order an investigation into the statements 1 have made.&quot; I am,&quot; Yours faithfully,&quot;F. Maurice, Major-General.&quot;20, Kensington Park Gardens, May 6.&quot;The Prime Minister pointed out that General Maurice directlychallenged three statements which had been made in the House ofCommons : one made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and twoby himself.The first of these statements challenged was one made byMr. Bonar Law on 23rd April, to the effect that the question of theextension of the line, carried out before the battle commenced on21st March, was not dealt with at all by the Supreme War Council.&quot;it was pointed out that the extension of the line to Barisis hadbeen arranged, before the meeting of the Supreme War Council,between Field-Marshal Haig and General Petain, and in this con-nection the following extract, from a statement made by Sir douglas haig at the Supreme War Council meeting on 2nd February was read : &quot; Lastly, during the recent battle in Flanders, he had, at general Petains request, agreed to, and had now extended thefront first to the Oise and afterwards to Barisis . . . . &quot; etc.(I.C.-42).The extension of the line, discussed at the Supreme War Council,had been a further extension recommended by the permanent military Representatives, and this further extension had never beencarried out, and had not been alluded to in Parliament on theoccasion of Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s statement. The statement challenged by.Genei-al Maurice had referred solely to the accomplished extensionof Barisis, and had been perfectly correct.With regard, to the second statement, namely, that the army inFrance was considerably stronger on 1st January, 1918, than on1st January, 1917, which was stated by General Maurice to beincorrect, Mr. Lloyd George said the actual figures were quoted byhim from an official War Office document, and were that on the1st January, 1917, the total ration strength of the British armies inFrance was 1,594,000 ; whilst on the 1st January, 1918, the totalration strength was 1,970,000, which showed a total increase of376,000 men. It might be argued that there had been during thisperiod a large increase in the number of labour units, but the total strength of such labour units on the 1st January, 191.8, was 142,000,whilst approximately the strength of these units on the 1st January,1917, was probably 42,000. Consequently, even taking all the labourunits out of consideration, the total ration strength of the british army in France at the beginning of 1918 was 276,000 stronger thanit was in the beginning of 1917. Labour units, however, mightfairly be included in the strength of the army, and at present wewere greatly in need of further labour to increase our defensivestrength.With regard to the third statement of General Maurice, in whichthe Prime Minister had been challenged as regards the correctnessof his assertion that there was only one white division in Meso-potamia, and in Palestine only three white divisions, Mr. LloydGeorge pointed out that he believed that he was entirely correct in
stating there was only one white division in Mesopotamia, and thathis statement as regards the three white divisions in Egypt had beenmade on the authority of the report of the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff when the War Cabinet was considering the possibilityof bringing reinforcements from Palestine to meet the emergency onthe Western front (War Cabinet 371, Minute 5).It was pointed out that General Maurice had been present when this statement was made.Mr. Lloyd George said that when the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Stall&apos; had stated that there were only three British divisions in Egypt, he had asked further questions of General Wilson, andhad been told that the other divisions in Egypt were mixed divisions.Considerable discussion ensued as to the meaning of thecharges which General Maurice brought forward in saying thatthe Prime Minister was incorrect with regard to the number of theBritish forces in. Prance on the 1st January, 1918, and with regardto his statement that what the Prime Minister said implied that sir Douglas Iiaig&apos;s fighting strength on the eve of the great battlewhich began on the 2ist March had not been diminished.Lord Milner was of opinion that General Maurice meant that between the 1st January, 19.18, and the beginning of the battle, aconsiderable reduction had taken place in the number of the battalions employed, all British divisions having been reduced from12 to 9 battalions in strength, and that, consequently, the actualfront line had been weakened to that extent.It was pointed out that, if this was General Maurice&apos;s contentions-tiou, he had only taken into account rifle strength, and had paid noregard to the very large increase in artillery, flying corps, tanks,trench mortars, and machine-guns, which had undoubtedly been increased at the expense of the infantry, and should certainly havebeen included in the fighting strength of the army.Mr. Lloycl George said that one of the most serious considera-tions was that General Maurice had attended the War Cabinet forthe two days following the date of his speech in the House ofCommons (9th April), and had never said a word either at theCabinet or to him privately, challenging the accuracy of the figures which he had given. If General Maurice had considered it was nothis duty to do so in the cabinet, it was at any rate his duty to make representations to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff on thismatter.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he had heardnothing from General Maurice until the 3(Jth April, after he had left the post of Director of Military Operations, when he received a letterfrom, him on this subject,The Prime Minister also pointed out that, while general maurice might have some answer to the charge, if it could be shownthat the reduction of the men in the infantry battalions had notbeen compensated for by addition to the other fighting units, yetthis was a matter the responsibility for which did not rest upon theWar Cabinet, but on the military authorities, on whom lay the dutyof the distribution of our fighting men.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that this was not anisolated attack on the Government. In the &quot; Morning Post &quot; nearly every day articles had appeared with reference to the strength ofour forces in France, more particularly with reference to thereduction in the number of battalions.Mr. Lloyd George informed the War Cabinet that he hadreceived a question which would be put by private notice that after-noon by Mr. Asquith. A general discussion ensued as to the reply which should be made and the action which the Government shouldtake in this matter.Mr. Bonar Law said that he held very strong views on thisquestion.   The veracity of himself and the Prime Minister had been
challenged. He could not agree that this matter could be met only by making statements in the House of Commons, but that, in hisopinion, it was essential that a Judicial Enquiry should be held, as this letter reflected on his personal, honour.With reference to the position of General Maurice, the Adjutant-General said that this officer had contravened the Army Act and theOfficial Secrets Act, both, of which were military offences, whichcould be dealt with under the Army Act without any enquiry beingmade as to the truth or otherwise of the statements. It wouldbe possible to hold a Court of Enquiry, and if civilians were involved this Court could be held under the Barrett Act; but any Court of Inquiry must necessarily involve obtaining evidence from the French dealing with matters of much secrecy and confidential nature, and Sir Nevil Macready agreed with general smuts that it would be practically impossible to make public areport of any such proceedings.It wottld be possible to deal with General Maurice from a purely disciplinary point of view, either by putting him on half-payor retired pay, or by trying him by court-martial, and Lord Milnervery strongly urged that whatever course was taken the question of disciplinary action should be kept quite distinct from any other action which the Government might contemplate.The Adjutant-General stated that he had already written toGeneral Maurice, asking him in the usual Service manner for his reasons for having written the letter contrary to regulations.With regard to the course proposed by Mr. Bonar Law as to a judicial Enqmiry being held, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs expressed himself very strongly against any such proposal.He said he was of opinion that the proper course to pursue was fora statement to be made in the House of Commons to the effect thatthe Ministers adhered to the statements which they had made,bringing forward, if necessary, sufficient facts to prove them, or, ifthis was not considered sufficient, to hold a Secret Session, when thewhole subject could be debated.Mr. Bonar Law said that he would be unable to- pursue that course, as the charges made against the two Ministers, were thatthey had made misstatements, and if their defence was only to bemade in the House of Commons, when General Maurice, who had made the charges, could not be present, it would be considered thatan ex parte statement only had been made.,It was generally agreed that, whatever course was followed, itwould be absolutely necessary to limit the scope of the enquiry tothe charges of inaccuracy made in General Maurice&apos;s letter, and thatit would be most inadvisable to open the door to an enquiry intothe many other questions which had been so constantly raised inthe press of late.Strong objections were taken to any proposal that this question should go before a Committee of the House of Commons, which wasnot in any way a judicial tribunal, and equally strong objections were taken to holding a Court of Enquiry under the Army Act, atwhich two Ministers of the Crown would have to attend if the statements challenged by General Maurice were to be fully examinedbefore such a Court.The War Cabinet decided 1. That the Army Council should deal with the military offenceswhich had been committed by Major-General sir frederick Maurice.2. That the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in replying to thequestion which was to be put by Mr. Asquith in theHouse of Commons that afternoon, should state thatGeneral Maurice&apos;s letter raised two questions : oneinvolving military discipline, and the other the veracityof Ministerial statements.   The first question would be
dealt with by the Army Council in the ordinary way,and, with regard to the second, the Government proposedto ask two of His Majesty&apos;s Judges to act as a Court of honour to enquire into the charge of misstatementsalleged to have been made by Ministers.3. That the Court of Honour, composed as above, shouldassemble at the earliest possible date and be asked torender a report, if possible, within a week.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W., 1,May 7, 1918.o
