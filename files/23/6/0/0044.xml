Food Production 1. With reference to War Cabinet 415, Minute 14, the Warin 1919: Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the President of theWales Board of Agriculture and Fisheries (Paper G.T.-4658), setting forthtwo alternative programmes of food production, the first of which provided an insurance only against decreased production in 1949.In order to ensure as high a production of foodstuffs in 1919 as in1918, it would be necessary to add 550,000 acres to the 11,000,000acres now under tillage. This insurance programme would require13,500 labourers, in addition to the 30,000 whom it was hoped toreplace from German prisoners and National Service volunteers(War Cabinet 412, Minute 15), and also 3,00&apos;) prisoners for drainagework. The second and larger programme proposed to add 1,000,000acres to the tillage land of England and Wales. This additionwould provide about five weeks&apos; supply of breadstuffs, and would save shipping to the extent of about 870,000 tons. It would require10,500 labourers over and above those required for the insuranceprogramme.Mr. Prothero explained that, to carry out either programme,legislation would be necessary to extend the compulsory powers ofthe Board, under the Defence of the Realm Act, for one year beyondthe period fixed for the expiration of those powers by the corn production Act, namely, 20th August, 1918. &apos; Even if both pro-grammes were rejected by the Cabinet, legislation would still benecessary, in order that allotment-holders might retain possession oftheir holdings, and in order that the English and Scottish Boards ofAgriculture might retain possession of the land which they had entered upon and were cultivating under the Defence of the RealmAct. The present powers of the Boards came to an end in August,owing to the insertion of Sub-Section 3 of Section II in the corn production Act during its passage through the House of Lords.Mr. Long was certain that there would be opposition to theproposed extension of the powers of the Board of Agriculture andFisheries unless there were some guarantee as to the reasonable useof those powers in certain counties. At present there was noequality of treatment from county to county. Some agricultural committees had an Appeal Tribunal, which, on the whole, actedfairly ; in other areas there was no Tribunal. Speaking generally,the Committees had done their work extremely well, but there were* some glaring instances to the contrary, where, as a result, land wasbeing wasted. In some cases the District Committees did little or nothing, and the whole work was thus done by the CentralExecutive, which became both judge and jury. Tire result was thecreation of serious aud widespread dissatisfaction. He would liketo see some provision made for the appointment, in all areas, ofcompetent Appeal Tribunals.Mr. Prothero agreed that there had been isolated cases, such asthose described by Mr. Long, which had caused great irritation, butthat was not, perhaps, surprising when the magnitude of the tillageprogramme was borne in mind. He proposed to issue an instruction to the War Agricultural Committees which- would provide thatobjections should be heard by a small Tribunal on which the land-owning interest would be represented.Mr. Long thought that such machinery would meet his criticism.With reference to the opposition in the Plouse of Lords, he was prepared to co-operate with the President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries in conciliating such opposition, provided that his proposals were approved.Mr. Prothero suggested that, with reference to the twoprogrammes, it would not be necessary for the Cabinet to decide infavour of either at present, provided the extended powers asked forwere given to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries.Sir Arthur Lee urged the adoption of the larger programme and pointed out that the number of men required for the largerprogramme over and above the number required for the smaller
(b.) Scotland. 2. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary for Scotland, dealing with the Agricultural programme for 1919 (Paper G.T.-4G91), in which it was shown that, owingto the increased cultivation this year, there would be comparatively little room for further increase of the area to be put under cultivationfor 1919.Mr. Munro stated that he was in substantial agreement withMr. Prothero, but he wished to emphasise the great dissatisfactionwhich was being caused in Scotland by the competition of Govern-ment contractors for farm labour. Strong representations from three important agricultural areas had been made to him of thegreat difficulty in retaining labour on the land. Further, it was amatter of urgent necessity that spare parts should be imported atonce in sufficient numbers to replace worn-out parts when tractorswere overhauled during the summer, and to prepare for breakagesduring the next cultivation season.Mr. Beck stated that instructions had been issued with a viewto controlling supplies of labour to Government contractors andfarmers by the Employment Kxchauges.Mr. Austen Chamberlain stated that, with reference to thepurchase of spare parts, the Ministrj7 of Munitions had co-ordinatedthe demands of the various Departments, and authority had beengiven by the American Board to purchase what was required fromthe United States. He suggested that the Boards of Agriculture andFisheries should put forward any new demands to the Ministry ofMunitions for submission to the American Board.programme was only 10,500 men. Unless the smaller programmewere secured, it would be impossible to avert a serions decrease inthe present food output, the reason being that it was essential to&quot; rest &quot; some of the land now growing corn crops. He emphasised the necessity of informing the County Committees, without further delay, as to the programme for the coining year.Mr. Beck stated that the Minister of National Service did not see the labour in sight for the larger programme. The mainsupplies of casual labour were already allocated.It was pointed out that, on the one hand, tractors were coming forward in considerable numbers, and that the quality of womenswork on the land was steadily improving, although there were difficulties in connection with housing women where farms were small. On the other hand, if the larger programme were announced,there would be demands put forward at once for the labour to carry it out, and this would upset the present recruiting arrangements.It was undesirable, therefore, to put forward at this stage a programme for the carrying out of which the means were not insight.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To authorise the President of the Board of Agriculture andFisheries to proceed with a Bill extending the com-pulsory powers of the Board, not for one year, but forthe duration of the war.(6.) That the programme put forward by the President shouldhave the smaller scheme for its minimum and the largerfor its maximum, the actual amount attempted to bemade clearly dependent on the necessary supply oflabour being forthcoming.(c.) The Secretary of State for the Colonies should use his influence with landowners and occupiers with a view to obtaining their acceptance of the extension of the Board&apos;scompulsory powers, on the understanding that his proposals above mentioned were approved.
The War Cabinet decided To authorise the Secretary for Scotland to proceed on linessimilar to those approved above (Minute 1) for Englandand Wales.Man-Power: 3. With reference to War Cabinet 415, Minute  17, the WarMilitary Service Cabinet had before them a proposed Proclamation, prepared byjjno. z) Act, ryiB. Minister of National Service, withdrawing certain certificates of exemption from military service (Paper G.T.-4671).Mr. Beck explained that, in effect, the Proclamation took awayTribunal rights from boys under 19 years of age. The Proclamationdid not affect protection certificates issued under the Schedule ofProtected Occupations, namely, to men employed on Admiralty,War Office, or Munitions work, &amp;c, but it did affect Civil Servants.Parliamentary trouble might arise in connection with recruiting ofthe last surviving son of a widow, of whom at least one son haddied in the war ; but that criticism would not only apply to thosebetween IS and 19, but also up to the other ages clean cut by proclamation, and, in the view of the Minister of National Service,no exception should now be made for the cases under 19. If any. concession had to be made later on, it could not be restricted tothose under 19. Mr. Beck agreed that it was possible, by administrative action, to allow those covered by the proclamation to go before Tribunals.The War Cabinet approved the submission of the proclamation to Plis Majesty the King.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.,May 31, 1918.o
