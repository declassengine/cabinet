THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported thatNeuve-Eglise had been retaken by the Germans. Three more divisions had been put into the Lys battle by the enemy, making atotal of twenty-four German divisions, and this increase in strengthmight be taken as an indication of a continuance of the struggle inthat cpiarter. Three additional German divisions had also arrivednear Montdidier.Transport of 2. With reference to War Cabinet 388, Minute 2, the Chief ofGerman Divisions.    the Imperial General Staff reported that three more German divi-sions had arrived from Russia, making a total of 204 enemy divisions in all.[1365-391]
Disposition of 3. With regard to the disposition of the enemy divisions, theEnemy Divisions. chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that twenty-four had been engaged in theLys fighting, and ninety-eight on the Somme. Someof these divisions had been in action more than once, so there hadbeen an equivalent of 186 in action against the British and theFrench, of which 150 had been against the British. The Germanplan therefore appeared to be to knock out the British divisions.French Assistance. 4- Wit  &quot;&quot;gard to French assistance in the matter of moving upreserves to help the British, the Chief or the Imperial General Stairreported that there had been no inactivity on the part of the French ;the failure of the French to come up in larger numbers was due,in his opinion, to the failure of the Allies at the outset of the battleto have a General Reserve on the Western front. Now the french were massing, but the enemy had already massed. The french were moving up as fast as the roads would allow, but there were only four roads available. Our concentration was much impeded bythe fact that Amiens was under fire, which, although not preventinga few through trains, rendered impossible the proper working of the yards. With regard to new railway developments west of Amiens,a good report had been received from the Transportation committee at Versailles.German iCasualties. 5. With reference to War Cabinet 390, Minute 7, the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs reported that information had beenreceived from Madrid to the effect that the German and pro-Germanelements in that city were far from jubilant about the results so farachieved on the Western front. They admitted very heavy Germanlosses, talking openly of 500,000 as the figure, and admittingprivately to 600,000. Neither the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs nor the War Cabinet, however, attached credence to suchnumbers.Supreme WarCouncil:Appointment ofGeneral Belin.6. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported thatGeneral Belin had succeeded General Weygand as Military Repre-sentative to the French Section of the Supreme War Council at versailles. At the beginning of the war General Belin bad servedas General Joffre&apos;s Chief of Staff.Italian Co-opera-tion on theWestern Front.7. With, reference to War Cabinet 384, Minute 4, the Secretaryof State for War reported that he had seen the Marquis Imperiali inregard to the movement of Italian divisions. Two picked Italiandivisions were leaving for the Western front immediately after thefour French divisions.In this connection the Prime Minister read a telegram fromSignor Orlando, expressing his desire to give help.In view of the Prime Ministers recent telegram to Italy,however, it was not considered necessary to send any further message on the subject-Withdrawal ofReleased Soldiersfrom Civil Life.8. With reference to War Cabinet 382, Minute 10, the Secretaryof State for War again raised the question of the withdrawal ofreleased soldiers and army reserve munition workers from munitionfirms and Admiralty firms.In view of the fact that the First Lord of the Admiralty wasnot present, the War Cabinet withheld a decision on the subject, and asked Lord Derby to bring the matter up again when the First lord was presenf.
3 WO 391Shipment of 9. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by LordRemounts from Derby (Paper G.T.-4195) in regard to the shipment of remounts from america. America.    In the memorandum it was pointed out that it had become necessary to resume the shipment of horses and mules from america at the rate of 8,000 monthly, commencing in May. Theseshipments had been stopped during the last two months, but, owingto the heavy losses which had occurred during the recent battle, the stocks of animals in the remount depots were very low, were insufficient for prospective needs, and required replenishing.The Quarter-Master-General said that the number of animalsin Prance had decreased from 458,000 to 400,000. As fully threemonths must elapse between the time horses sail from America and become fit for issue in France it was necessary to make immediatearrangements.The Prime Minister suggested that it might be possible, bysome readjustment of the supply of horses in France behind thelines, to manage for the present without extra horses. GeneralWhigham was at the moment investigating conditions behind thelines, and this question of the supply of horses might form part ofthat enquiry.In view of the shortage of shipping and the desirability of using what shipping was available for American troops ratherthan for horses, the War Cabinet requested The Quarter-Master-General to have the need for additionalhorses examined by officers of his Department now inFrance. In the event of it being found that it was absolutely necessaiy to import more horses from America,the Quarter-JVlaster-General should then see the Ministerof Shipping on the subject again.Military Situation 10. With reference to War Cabinet 390, Minute 18, a draft in the East. telegram   to  Lord   Heading,   prepared   by  Lord  Pobert  Cecil(G.T.-423G), was considered.Lord Robert Cecil pointed out that Mr. Balfour had sentinstructions to Mr. Lockhart to put certain definite proposals toM. Trotzki. In view of this, it might jjerhaps be unnecessary to forward a lengthy statement of the case to America. It was alsoquestionable whether the passage referring to India was welladapted to appeal to American opinion.The War Cabinet decided that the draft, as it stood, presented the case in the right way. It was, however, suggested that, in thelast sentence, the desirability of the inclusion of American repre-sentative elements should be specially stressed. This, and such other alterations as might be necessary to adapt the message topresent circumstances, were left to the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, who was authorised to despatch it to Lord Reading.In this connection, telegram No. S9 from Mr. Lockhart, andtelegram No. 351 from Tokyo, were referred to as encouraging.Ireland. 11. Attention was drawn to a letter from Mr. Duke (Paper G.T.-4218) concerning the critical situation he anticipated in Ireland.After some discussion, it was decided that The Secretary should  ask Mr. Duke   to formulate  definite proposals for the consideration of the War Cabinet.
Supreme Command 12. The Prime Minister communicated to the War Cabinet aon the Western telegram just received from M. Clemenceau, expressing the French&apos; premier&apos;s assent to conferring on General Foch the designation of- &quot; General-in-Chief of the Allied Armies in France.&quot;The Chief of the Imperial General Staff was instructed toinform Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, and the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs to inform the American,Belgian, and Portuguese Governments.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,April 15, 1918.o
