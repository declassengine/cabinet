THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that there-Frout- was nothing to report in addition to the telegrams which had beenreceived in regard to the counter-attack carried out by the Frenchon the previous day. He had heard by telephone that the french were satisfied, on the whole; but no more details had been supplied.The French appeared to have used twenty divisions, and, so far,seventeen German divisions (including three from Prince RupprechFsarmy) had been identified. No doubt, however, the Germans musthave used a good many more than that number, because previous[1365-430] B
experience had shown that during a retirement it was very difficultto identify the divisions of the advancing side. The Germansclaimed that they had captured a total of 13,000 prisoners,including wounded, since the 9th June. The total number ofBritish and French prisoners captured by the Germans since the21st March now amounted to close on 200,000.Submarines. 2. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that a submarine hadbeen attacked with depth charges near the Tees, and possibly was sunk or badly damaged.Bruges and 3. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that, during a raid onZeebrugge. . . Bruges Docks and Zeebrugge, b\ tons of bombs were dropped.Dutch hospital ship Sunk:Publication of movements ofMinisters.4 With reference to War Cabinet 428, Minute 7, in regard tothe sinking of the Dutch hospital-ship &quot; Koningin Regentes,&quot; thequestion was raised as to how the newspapers obtained informationas to the departure of Sir George Cave and the delegates, which appeared in the press almost immediately before the delegates left.The view was expressed that it was most undesirable that anymention should be made in the press in regard to the movements ofBritish Ministers about to proceed overseas. It was conceivable that the information may have originated from Holland.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary should draw the attention of the Press Bureau tothe matter, and ask for a report as to how the information in regard to the time of departure of Sir George Cave andthe other delegates was obtained hy the press.Allied Policy in 5. &apos;Phe War Cabinet had under consideration a note by thethe Balkans. Director of Military Operations on a Report by the British military representative in regard to the Allied policj^ in the Balkans(Paper G.T.-4809).The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he wished&apos; strongly to endorse the request made by General Sackville-West,that the situation with regard to the Allied defensive policy in the balkan theatre should   be   put on a more satisfactory footing.General Guillaumat had been repeatedly asked, for his plans in theevent of a retirement, but so far they had not been obtained.   If(as there was reason to fear) there were no proper plans, it was quite possible that there might be a bad disaster to our troops inthat theatre of war.   In this connection the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff informed the War Cabinet that General Guillaumatwas being recalled, and was being replaced by General Franchetted&apos;Esperey.    In his Report General Sackville-West said that hewould like the question brought before the Military Representa-tives at a very early date, and added that his position would be greatly strengthened if he received a letter from the Secretary ofthe War Cabinet asking for the views of the Military Representativesas to the adequacy of the plans which General Guillaumat was instructed in December last to forward.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary, under instructions from the Prime Minister,should inform the British Military Representatives that theWar Cabinet have expressed anxiety as regards the situa-
17 9tion in the Balkans, and desired him to bring this matter to the notice of the Military Representatives with a view to carrying out the instructions contained in Joint Note 4.Indian Reforms:Publication of joint Report.6. With reference to War Cabinet 428, Minute 13, the WarCabinet had before them a draft of a proposed reply, by the Secretaryof State for India, to a question in the House of Commons as to thepublication of the joint report of the Secretary of State for India andthe Viceroy on Indian Constitutional Reforms (Paper G.T.-4810)(Appendix I).The AVar Cabinet decided That the reply should be as follows : The Viceroy and I have embodied our proposals forcarrying out the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government ofAugust last in the form of a report to the War Cabinet.It &quot;will be remembered that in the August announcement it-was stated that ample opportunity would be afforded for public discussion of the proposals which would be submitted in due course to Parliament. Owing to .their heavy pre-occupation with the immediate work of the war, theGovernment have not yet been able to consider the report and to formulate their conclusions upon the proposals contained in it. But they have decided that it shall be presented to Parliament as soon as sufficient copies areavailable in India and here so as to afford the opportunityfor public discussion promised in the August announce-ment, and so that in coming to their final decision theGovernment may have the advantage of considering any suggestions to which its publication may give rise.Grant of King&apos;commissions to indians.7. With reference to AA7ar Cabinet 428, Minute 12, the AVarCabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of State for India,dated 27th May, 191S, to which were appended certain telegrams which had passed between the Secretary of State for India and theViceroy (Paper G.T.-466.1) (Appendix II), and a note by lord curzon on &quot; Indian Commissions&quot; (Paper G.T.-4752) (appendix iii).The Secretary of State for India said that certain proposals inregard to the grant of Indian commissions had been made by theCommander-in-Chief in India during his own absence in that country.These proposals had been temporarily rejected by the Cabinet. Hisown memorandum summarised the case, and he had only a fewadditional remarks to make. During his visit to India he had beendeeply impressed by the attitude of the Indian people towards thisquestion, an attitude which was wholly produced by the war. Therewas a demand by all sorts and conditions of Indians to be allowed to learn how to defend themselves. This was partly due to the bom-bombardment of Madras by the &quot; Linden,&quot; which brought war home tothe people. It was also due to two apprehensions, which he wouldcategorise as follows : -(a.) The historic fear of a great Mohammedan invasion from thenorth, and(6.) The new fear of Japan, which was, however, more remote.The Indian people had said to him : &quot; AVe rely upon you to defendus, but we.see your great and numerous preoccupations elsewhere,and we want to learn how to defend ourselves and how to help youmore.&quot; Running through it all there was a feeling in the nature ofshame or regret that they had not been able to render greater assist-ance. He would cite one instance, where an Indian politician had said to him, when they were discussing the question of Indianreforms and the recommendations that would be  made in the
Viceroy&apos;s and his own report : &quot; J. have worked for thirty years to getrecommendations of this kind made to the British Government; now that they are going forward, I can die in peace ; but what gives memuch greater satisfaction is that my nephew is now fighting inMesopotamia.&quot;   This was said by a man Avho did not belong to the recognised fighting clabses, the unsuitability of which for militaryservice, was, however, not due to want of physical bravery but towant of physical stamina.   The motives underlying this feeling wereanxieties about the defence of their country, a desire for more adequate training, better military opportunities, and a wdsh to make good soldiers, in order that they might discharge their duties to-their own country and the Empire.   Now, after long and carefuldeliberation, the Commander-in-Chief in India had put forward a request for the grant of a maximum of: 200 temporary King&apos;s coin-missions ; lhat number to be worked up to gradually, recipientsbeing selected with the greatest care, and the output limited toabout fifty every six months.    India had already raised about450,000 men, including those who were in the army at the commence-ment of the war, and an appeal had now been made to her for another 500,000 soldiers.   The request now before the Cabinet wasonly for some 200 temporary commissions, to be distributed over twoyears, should the war last that period.   In the circumstances, he couldnot regard this as an exaggerated demand.   He doubted whether theEmpire had the right to ask for 1,000,000 fighting men from India,unless it would at the same time concede these 200 commissions.Were they to say to India that she alone in the Empire was unfittedto provide officers ?   There was to-day a large number of youngIndian gentlemen who were anxious to serve in the war, but whohad been denied the opportunity, as commissions were not opento them, and questions of caste and tradition made it impossiblefor them to go into the ranks.      They were debarred, therefore,from  lighting, and no  other  appropriate  vocation was open tothem.    Air. Montagu said that he had read Lord Curzon&apos;s paper,and  he thought that  either Lord Curzon  or himself had mis-understood   the   Commander-in-Chiefs  intentions.    Sir   CharlesMonro stated that he wanted the commissions he now asked forprincipally for men who had won them, or would win them, byvalour in the field.    He agreed, however, with  Lord Curzon&apos;proposal, that to announce that they intended to give ,200 coin-missions would be both unwise and dangerous, and General Monrohimself had now suggested that the output should be limited toabout fifty every half-year.  In Mr. Montagu&apos;s view, the Commander-in-Chief should not pledge himself to any particular number.   ThePrime Minister had sent a message to India making a stirringappeal for another  500,000, fighting  men.     Of  these   500,000about 100,000 woidd   be utilised  for new formations, and theremainder were required to keep up existing formations in the field.He thought, in the circumstances, that this request for 200 corn-missions was not a very serious consideration, and, in view of thePrime  Ministers   appeal for another  500,000  men,   he   urgedthat   it  should be granted.   With a view to  meeting possibleobjections he had prepared, for the consideration of the Cabinet,the following draft of a telegram to be sent to India : &quot; The Government approves of your proposals to recom-mend for commissions within the estimate of fifty in sixmonths provided that &quot;1. Preference be given to those who have served in thenon-commissioned ranks of the army and who have won them,by gallantry in the field.&quot; 2. That you should be very careful in recommendingfrom outside the army, and that no commission should begiven from outside or inside the army except after adequatetraining, in order to ensure that only those officers should be
sent to units for whom there is every prospect of success.&quot; 3. That no number should be named, but that you shouldnot make recommendations beyond your estimate, and thatwhen, if ever, you reach 100, you should report to the Govern-ment at home and obtain from them fresh authority before making any further recommendations.&quot;Lord. Curzon thought that the Indian gentlemen referred to byMr. Montagu were hardly justified iu saying that they had beengranted no opportunities during the war, as the Cabinet had, thepreviotts year, sanctioned the grant of nine commissions for valourin the field. They were all agreed as to the desirability and the justice of granting commissions to men who had proved their capacity to hold commissions, and had earned them on the field of battle. He confessed, however, that he was in considerable doubt as to the second category and as to what actually was proposed. Ashe had stated in his note, the telegram from India of the 20th Aprilwas not very clear.   In one place it was stated : (a.) That these civilian candidates were to be nominated bylocal Governments ;(b.) That, from the list, the Commander-in-Chief was to selectnames for submission to the Viceroy ;(a) That approved candidates are then to be given temporarycommissions, subject to His Majesty&apos;s approval.This undoubtedly implied that the commissions would have no connection with active military service, but would be in the natureof political rewards.   A little later it was stated : (i.) That a fair standard of education and some knowledge of english would be demanded ;(ii.) That all nominees will undergo preliminary instruction atan Officers&apos; Training School, during which they will begraded and paid as Cadets ;(hi.) That only after these tests had been satisfied would the commissions be granted.These, he submitted, were two entirely different conceptions, as,in the one case, the commission was to be the result merely ofnomination, and, in the other, of a modicum of instruction andcertain elementary tests of fitness. It appeared that the grant ofthese commissions was to he less in the nature of reward for valourin the field than of encouragement to the land-owning classes. Hethought the War Cabinet must be quite sure that nominees, beforereceiving their commissions, would undergo exactly the same testsas an aspirant for an English commission. He thought it might bededuced from the telegrams that these Indian gentlemen would beexpected to raise troops and subsequently to train them. Was itintended that they should first go to college, or were they to proceed at once on service ? Apart from the uncertainty as to the exactnature of the latest proposals of the Commander-in-Chief in India,there was the larger aspect of the question to be considered.Lord Curzon said that for years he had advocated the grant ofcommissions to Indians, and had his scheme materialised, as he had intended at its inception, there w-ould not be now nine Indiangentlemen holding commissions, but at least forty or fifty. he deprecated treating these 200 commissions as a kind of bribe toIndia to supply another 500,000 fighting men. The question of selection, moreover, would require the greatest care, and might leadto serious complications. If unsuitable men were given commissionedrank the officering of the Indian army in future would undoubtedlyhe adversely affected. If, later, it were necessary to withdraw the commissions now granted, a vast amount of ill-feeling wouldbe caused, and if the. withdrawal had to be on an extensive scale, the policy now proposed would  be dealt a very serious
blow. It seemed that fifty commissions were to be given atthe end of every six months. It was hardly conceivable that anyIndian gentleman could become fit to hold a commission in so short a time. When he started the Imperial Cadet Corps he had suggestedthat approved cadets might get their commissions after two years,but Lord Kitchener, who was then Comniander-in-Chief in India,bad insisted that this period should be extended to three. Therecommendation now before the Cabinet came from the Governmentof India, and was strongly pressed by the present Commander-in-Chief there. Was this recommendation, however, endorsed by themilitary authorities at the India Otfice and the War Office? He had before him an earlier paper, emanating from the India Office and sent him by Lord Islington, which was, he understood, drafted by theMilitary Secretary to that Department, in winch it was stated that,in the unanimous opinion of the military officers, the proposeddeparture would have a disastrous effect on the recruiting of british officers for the Indian army. He would like to know more preciselyAvhat would be the course followed in the case of a zemindar of goodbirth who might be nomiuated for a commission. It was originally intended, he thought, that he should go to a training college. Didsuch colleges exist in India for this purpose ? In any case it seemed to be no longer the intention. Mo feared that the cabinet were to-day really being asked to come to a decision of the gravestimportance and of far-reaching consequences, for a political objectrather than to meet a military need. That this was so was apparentfrom the Viceroy&apos;s telegram of 18th May, 1918 : &quot;It is most important that we should retain the goodwill of this class, and that their power should be utilised to thefullest extent in the interests of recruiting, and we are assured that a position in the army, with the prospect of securingpermanent commissions in the case of those found suitable,would best effect this object.&quot;The project was, indeed, ardently advocated by Sir Charles Monro ;but had it the support of the leading military authorities with experience of the Indian army? And, even if such support wereaccorded at Army Headquarters in India, might it not be due to a sense of discipline rather than to feelings of genuine conviction? he urged the Cabinet to be quite certain, before adopting the proposal,that it was acceptable to military officers of real Indian experience.The Secretary of State for India pointed out that it was not proposed to grant commissions to Indians after six months&apos; training.The training was to be adequate, and he understood it took a year.It was only intended that every six months a fresh batch of fiftycandidates should be selected.Mr. Chamberlain said that he was much impressed with the casemade out by the Commander-in-Chief and the Secretary of State forIndia, and he was quite prepared now to recommend its acceptance by the Cabinet. He thought they might lay down the followingpremises : (a.) That they were ready to agree unhesitatingly to the grantof commissions for proved gallantry in the field and capacity to lead ; and(6.) They would grant commissions to other carefully selectedcandidates, who, after being trained as cadets andproving their fitness, would be posted to regiments and proceed on1 active service.No commissions should, however-, be given merely as a rewardfor success imrecruiting. He suggested that an addition should bemade to Mr. Montagu&apos;s draft in the sense that no commissions shouldbe grantedior ornamental, purposes, but only to men who were fit and willing to serve at the front. As there was some doubt as to the exactmeaning of the Commander-in-Chiefs proposals, he would further
suggest that the telegram should give the CabineFs own interpreta-tion of them, and say that these were accepted subject to the fore-going provisions. . As he had said, he was himself in full agreementwith the recommendations of the Indian Government. No doubtlong-standing and deep-rooted prejudices would have to be overcome.Everything depended on the leaders in the army and the extent oftheir loyal support. Many retired officers would resent the innovation,hut a younger generation was growing up which would view thingsin a different light. He thought that they might trust the presentCommander-in-Chief, who was a man of sound and ripe judgment;his reputation was at stake in this matter, and he would be bound to watch carefully every stage in the scheme as it developed. He him-self would give the Commander-in-Chief the full confidence of theCabinet, and a wide discretion. When he was Secretary of Statefor India he had discussed various questions with GeneralMonro before the latter went out to take up his presentappointment, among them the question of commissions. He hadbegged General Monro to go into the matter with an open mind,and had stated that he found it impossible to say in perpetuity tothe fighting classes of India, &quot; You can enter the professions with theprospect of eventually obtaining the highest positions, such as a seaton the Viceroy&apos;s Council, or a place on the Bench of the HighCourt but, as a fighting man you have no opening.&quot; It was thisinequality of opportunity which, in Mr. Chamberlains opinion,demanded a solution of the problem. General Monro had replied:&quot; My view is, that if you did not mean to give commissions to Indians,you should not have brought them over to fight in France,&quot; Incommending this question to General Monro&apos;s careful consideration,he had added : &quot; I do not care how small your scheme is to begin with. The essential thing is that the first experiment should succeed.&quot;There had therefore been no pressure on General Monro to go faster than he thought safe. Further, General Monro had expressed to himhis wish to start in India an Army Council. Mr. Chamberlain washimself opposed to the idea, but he believed, however, that theCommander-in-Chief had meetings of the principal members of theStaff at least once a week, when these and kindred problems were fully discussed, and that it must therefore be assumed that theCommander-in-Chiefs recommendation was made after hearing theviews of men in close touch with the Indian army and with their general concurrence.The Adjutant-General said that he thought the project of raising an additional 500,000 Indian fighting troops was achimera, as there were no officers or N.O.O.&apos;s to train them. Thescheme, no doubt, looked well on paper, but the white personnel forits training was not available. He himself had served in India, and before coming to the Cabinet he had consulted the Quarter-Master-General, who had a wider experience of that country, and they were both of opinion that if this concession were made it would adversely affect the recruiting of British officers for the Indian army. Thepresent proposals seemed to be based on the raising of the additional500,000 men. In order to train these men General Monro badto look to the War Office to give them the proper stiffening of whitepersonnel, and, in present circumstances, this could not be provided.The Secretary of State for India pointed out that he had onlyyesterday received a letter from the War Office approving the offer of the additional 500,000 troops.The Military Secretary to the India Office said that when theproposal first came before the War Cabinet they had no time togive the question proper consideration, as the Viceroy was anxiousto make an announcement on the subject at the Delhi Conference.The War Cabinet had then said it was too important a matter to bedecided in a hurry, and had asked for time for a further con-sideration. On re-examination, the proposal did not seem to him tobe nearly so harmful as when it was first put forward. Lord Curzonhad quoted from an India Office paper, in which it had been stated
that the project would have a disastrous effect upon the recruiting of British officers for the Indian army. When this paper had been written it had been naturally (from the Government of india telegram), but, as it turned out, erroneously assumed that it was intended to grant 200 commissions at once. As regards the trainingof selected candidates, there was at present in India a cadet battalionfor the training of British officers for British battalions. He surmisedthat it was now proposed either to start Indian cadet battalions onthe same lines or to attach Indian companies to the existing Britishcadet battalion.Mr. Barnes said that he favoured the proposal subject topreference being given to men who were selected on account of theirvalour in the field.Mr. Bonar Law said that he thought that the latest telegrams from India indicated that the present Comnninder-in-Chief hadcarefully considered every argument which had been put forward by General Macready. He himself thought that the Cabinet should adopt the proposal.General Smuts said that he thought the Cabinet might well be guided by the Commander-in-Chief and Sir Herbert Cox. If they were confident that the scheme was necessary, that it would be successful,and produce no evil consequences, he thought it should be accepted.He had been much influenced by the larger considerations that theEmpire was growing more and more to depend upon India for man-power, more especially in the Mesopotamian and Palestine theatres of operations. He did not think that the request for commissions to be given to 200 officers for an existing army of 500,000 men was too much.The Prime Minister said that it was essential to raise the extra500,000 men in India. They had to consider the militaryproblem which wotdd confront us next year. Pie thought that theSecretary of State for India had made out a very strong case for bringing Indian gentlemen into the Indian Army. What they wanted to-day in the commissioned ranks was a man who was aneducated gentleman. He himself was disposed to trust theCommander-in-Chief in India, who was a man of great knowledge and of some experience of Indian conditions, as he had fought inmore than one frontier campaign. He did not agree with lord curzon that the proposed scheme was mainly political in its object.It appeared that, as a matter of fact, General Monro&apos;s views weresupported by his Staff, who were all officers who were on the spot,who were men of great Indian experience, and, further, who had toconsider both the problems that confronted us to-day and thosewhich would require consideration after the war. He was therefore prepared to accept the scheme, and to leave it to the Commander-iu-Chief in India and his advisers to watch its development.The War Cabinet decided To authorise the Secretaiy of State for India to send thefollowing telegram to the Indian Government : &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government appi-oves of your proposals torecommend for commissions up to the number of 200,provided that &quot;(i.) A fair proportion be given to those who have served as Indian officers or in the non-com-missioned ranks of the Indian army, and whohave won them by good service in the field.&quot; (ii.) That you should be very careful that no coin-missions should be given from outside or inside the army except after adequate training, inorder to ensure that only those officers shouldbe sent to units for whom therejs every prospectof success.&quot; (iii.) That no number should be named publicly.&quot;
Enemy Debts 9. In continuation of War Cabinet 425, Minute 20, the war committee. Cabinet expressed a general approval of the principles recommendedby the Enemy Debts Committee, as set out in their Reports P.-23 ofJanuary 23, 1918, and P.-23 a of February 6, 1918.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 12, 1918.American Eein- 8. The Prime Minister drew the attention of the War Cabinetforcements. to a telegram, dated the 10th June, 1918, from Colonel Wagstaffe,which indicated the possibility of the six divisions of american troops that were being shipped to France during the month of Junebeing allocated to the United States army. He pointed out that ofthe 120,000 Americans that had arrived during Ma)&apos;, one half hadbeen allotted to the French. There were objections to this, inasmuch as it was very important to keep our divisions up to strength, and,moreover, owing to the language difficulty, it was probable that better co-ordination would result if the Americans were brigadedwith British troops in preference to French. In this connection thePrime Minister pointed out that if the new arrivals were brigadedwith French troops, General Foch would be departing from thearrangements he had made with us. If, on the other hand, general pershing proposed to incorporate them into the United States army,it would be a departure on his part from the agreement reached between the Americans and ourselves (vide Annexure (A) toResolutions of the Supreme War Council, June, 1918), and it wouldbe necessary, after learning General Foch&apos;s views, to telegraph to president Wilson on the subject.General Du Cane, the Head of the British Military Missionwith General Foch, stated that the sending of the UnitedStates troops sailing during June to the American area of theI Vth Corps, might be only a preliminary arrangement, and that he felt sure that General Foch&apos;s only object was to get them organised and ready for use at the earliest possible moment, and consecpientlyhe was of opinion that General Foch would not agree to their joiningup with the American army As regards their incorporation in either the British or French armies, General Du Cane said that, inthis connection, it would be necessary to consider whether we hadthe requisite machinery to deal with the whole of these United Statesdrafts of infantry and machine-gunners.The War Cabinet decided that General Du&apos; Cane, on his return to France, should, as soon aspossible, lay the case before General Foch, and ascertainhis views on this matter, and also his opinion as to whetherGeneral Pershing is proposing to depart from the terms ofthe recent agreement, telegraphing the information obtainedfrom General Foch to the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff for transmission to the War Cabinet.
APPENDIX I.G.T.-48I0. --Indian Reforms.Publication of Joint Report of Secretary of Slate for India and the Viceroy.Proposed Peply by Secretary of State for India to Question in House of commons as to Publication.    War Cabinet 428, Minute 14.THE Viceroy and I have embodied our proposals for carrying out the decision ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government of August last in the form of a Report to the War Cabinet.It will be remembered that in the August announcement it was stated that ample opportunity would be afforded for public discussion ol the proposals, which would besubmitted in due course to Parliament.Owing to their heavy preoccupation with the immediate work of the war theGovernment have not yet been able to examine the Report in detail, or to formulatetheir conclusions upon the proposals contained in it. But they have decided that itshall be presented to Parliament as soon as sufficient copies are available in India and here, so as to afford the opportunity for public discussion promised in the Augustannouncement, and so that in coming to their final decision the Government may havethe advantage of considering any suggestions to which its publication may give rise.APPENDIX II.G.T.-4681. --(Circulated by the Secretary of State for India.)I REGRETTED to learn on landing of the decision of the War Cabinet withregard to temporary commissions for Indians, and as I am inclined to think that thedecision may have been partly due to the fact that the telegrams from India didmot sufficiently explain the situation, I venture to trouble the Cabinet with amemorandum on the subject. &apos;Whilst the Viceroy and I were at Dehra Dun, nearing the completion of our report on constitutional changes in India, telegrams arrived from the Prime Ministerasking for increased co-operation in the war. The specific references to Asia andthe East in the telegrams led us to the conclusion that it was our duty to see how much could be done, and how far we could make a new contribution which theWar Cabinet and public opinion would regard as satisfactory. &apos; We were bothmindful of criticism that had been made in the past, and the extravagant figures ofpossibilities which had been published by irresponsible people. The second and secret telegram from the Prime Minister addressed to the Army Department told usdefinitely that in his opinion the war was spreading eastwards, and ended with astatement that the Viceroy should &quot; do everything in your power to increase theIndian establishment for war, not only in troops, but,&quot; &amp;c.Here was a demand that we should do. every thing in our power to increase theIndian establishment for war, and my information leads me to think that by thetime all the men that we can get in India are trained (for it takes longer to train an indian soldier in the Indian climate than a British soldier at home I believe the shortest period allowed is 28 weeks), we may require every man that we can get.Is a civilian student of the war indulging in empty speculation whenhe thinks that it is not impossible that this year&apos;s campaign on theWestern front will not leave the German incapable of any further effort in any theatre of war, although it may leave him convinced that no useful purpose is to be served by attacks in France or Flanders? Is it not thenlikely that he should determine to endeavour to reconquer the territories that wehave conquered in the East? Not only would he thus wrest from us the onlyterritory we have conquered, but he might achieve disastrous, consequences to us
by startling the Eastern world and threatening the security of India. Is it not also possible that the exhaustion of our own man-power would make it highly desirable in such an emergency to rely in the main upon troops raised in India for thedefence of India, Mesopotamia,, and Palestine? I do not believe that anyone couldpredict the effect of a German-inspired invasion of Persia or of Afghanistan uponthe North-West Frontier. I am certain that thinking Indians are very alarmed atthe possibilities that we may be too much occupied in the West to maintain our traditional function of defending the Indian border, and this feeling is at the bottom of a widespread demand to be traine&quot;d in the art of defence. For these reasons, and because of the Prime MinisteFs own appeal, we determined that the situation was sufficiently grave and serious to risk the slight prolongation of my stay in India,and therefore on my own responsibility I suggested to the Viceroy that we should proceed at once to Simla, summon his colleagues and discuss the situation fully.(I telegraphed to the India Office and to the Prime Minister what I was doing.) we discussed all matters, not only with his Government, but with the Heads of Depart-ments and Secretaries, but I will confine my remarks to the man-power problem,partly because this is the only matter upon which the Cabinet has expressed an opinion!,and partly because the consideration of the financial proposals which I hoped tomake had to be postponed on, account of the unfortunate currency crisis which occurred at that time.We started by trying to ascertain what was the number of recruits which couldbe handled by the military authorities. This question was complicated by the factthat mo billeting is possible in India, that the discipline and health of the recruitscould not be maintained under any form of billeting, and that it would necessitatebuilding (and building materials are scarce) and the use of existing buildingsintended for other purposes. There was also the question of officers to train the men.Without going into the subject in detail, it is sufficient to state that I understood from the Commander-in-chief that he could deal with and use 500,000 men.The next question to decide was whether that number could be obtained, and, ifit could be obtained, whether they would be serviceable fighting material. the universal opinion was that on certain conditions it could. To anyone not conversantwith the details it would seem strange that there was some difficulty about raisingso small a number out of a population of 300,000,000, but the limitations are very real.If it should prove possible to get more than this number, well and good. I think we were all agreed that if the Prime Minister&apos;s telegram was to be taken seriously,we must deal with whatever we could get to the best of our ability, but that weshould first concentrate on this 500,000.The first condition which had to be met was that recruits should be assured thatif they entered the ranks as privates, and fought their way by valour in the field and by gaining the confidence of their fellow-soldiers, access to the commissionedranks&apos;should be open to them. The young Englishman who enters the army as aprivate has this prospect before him. I am sure you could not get him, and I think you ought not to get him, if he had not. Hie fact that a field-marshal&apos;s baton iscarefully concealed among other impedimenta in the soldiers knapsack is one of the basic principles of the success of His Majesty&apos;s armies in the field, and althoughfew, if any, privates are destined to wield it, it is the emblem which underlies the moral of our troops. We were all agreed that if we were to invite the indians to came to our assistance in this war of democracy, this principle must be established.A refusal of it means that you will not get the men. If you do not want the men, thePrime Minister&apos;s telegram would never have been sent. The intention is to granttemporary commissions on the recommendations of commanding officers to men inthe ranks who would be acceptable to their fellow officers and Who had proved theircapfacity. There is no intention of giving an Indian a commission because he is an indian,&apos; but only to give it on the same- terms as an Englishman could earn it. the selected candidate would have to go through the necessary training before he tookhis place with his brother officers.I would pause here to observe that this proposal has no connection whatever withthe proposals hitherto made by the Government of India for the granting of corn-missions. Those proposals were intended-as a permanent alteration in the fabricof the army. This is a method of earning by gallantry and good conduct in thefield purely temporary commissions for the term of the war only/ It is obviouslyinapplicable to peace conditions. It is difficult to foresee what the Indian army willbe like after the war, but no one dreams of requiring 500,000 men under arms. Itis meant as a temporary measure to suit war conditions, to stimulate recruiting, and
to assist us in providing officers at a time when British officers are necessarilyscarce.This, then, was the first condition of the possibility of assistance on this scale.We did not think that the men would come, or ought to be asked to come, withoutany prospect of obtaining commissioned rank before them. It was then held by theGovernment of India, I think unanimously, that the mere statement of this principle would not be sufficient, but that it must be applied on a liberal scale to show the indians that we meant business. The military authorities were of opinion thatthere were large numbers of men who could be trained as officers, and principles havebeen so often announced in India without being applied that it was felt that a merepromise would not be sufficient. The Government, therefore, unanimously fixed thenumber of 200. They do not desire to put in unsuitable men; they believe that theycan find suitable men, and if they cannot find them, they will not suggest unsuitablemen for commissions.But there is another condition which seemed to us at Simla essential. Ccnscrip-tion is impossible in India, partly because of the large numbers of the people whoare hereditary conscientious objectors to the taking of life, and partly because you would get into your net such enormous numbers who would be no use&apos;to you. you have, therefore, got to rely on the recruiting efforts of the Indians themselves. Nowthere are many Indian gentlemen who would make, in our opinion, good junior officers, but who cannot be expected to enlist in the ranks. Their traditions andtheir civilisation would prevent them fighting side by side with their own rvots. Wetherefore thought that we could get help from large zemindars, young nobles, youngprinces, if we told them that if they helped us to persuade their ryots and servants to join in the ranks, and if they were willing to come themselves, we should beprepared to train them in cadet corps in order that they might take their share, ifthey were fitted, in leading those whom they helped us to secure. Therefore it wasnot suggested that all the 200 commissions should be allotted to those who had entered the ranks, but that some should be reserved for this other category of possible officers.The effect upon British officers and their supply was carefully considered. Itdoes not seem to me that any British officer should be reluctant, or would beexpected to be reluctant, to do his share in the war whatever the conditions, andthese are temporary commissions which will not affect the permanent and futureconditions of Indian service. But it is no use shutting our eyes to the fact that thisrace feeling, which finds itself perhaps at present more drastically expressed in thearmy than anywhere else, must vanish in the future. Suitable Indians must havecommissions, and British officers must learn to get accustomed to it. No one voicesmore strongly than the present Commander-in-chief in India his belief that men ofall races will not hestitate to follow a capable officer of any race if he is capable, andthat is the principle upon which these recommendations are framed.Is it impossible to ask the War Cabinet to reconsider its decision ? I cannot see jny way to thinking that commissions in the Indian land forces would be asatisfactory alternative. The Indian land forces are a pure fiction, and commissionsin them have been too long regarded as merely honorary. You will never get thewhole-hearted assistance of India in the war if you make racial distinctions, andthe offer of commissions in the land forces will merely be regarded as such a distinction, and will be taken to indicate that you cannot, even now when you arecalling for help, get over discrimination between Indian and European. I can onlysay that the refusal of the War Cabinet to the proposal to grant temporary King&apos;commissions will have a deplorable result on the war spirit in India. &quot;It is aproposal made by the commander-in-chief on the full authority of the wholeGovernment of India after discussion and consultation with the Secretary of State,and now emphatically re-asserted. A refusal will be taken as evidence that whenthey did their best to respond to the Prime Minister&apos;s appeal, their help was notwanted. So far as I can discover, many educated and thoughtful Indians, of allkinds of political creeds, are a little ashamed of the fact that they have not beenable to do more in the war. They are anxious to equip themselves to defend theirown country. They are afraid of Mohammedan invasion from the north, withresults such as their history has made them familiar with. They are curiously andstrenuously afraid of Japan. &quot;Plelp us to defend ourselves, help us to train our-selves to assist you in defending us,&quot; is a cry which the Viceroy and I received onall hands. It is a proper spirit and a right spirit, and it is not only because I was responsible for these recommendations, but because of the effect of refusing, that Iwould ask the Cabinet to reconsider their decision at an early date.
I circulate herewith the telegram of the 27th April to the Government of Indiaand their reply. I would myself prefer that there should be no public mention ofany number of these temporary commissions. The Commander-in-chief has given  an estimate, and I should like him to be authorised to recommend candidates within this number. The number actually given must depend on the actual supply of fitcandidates and the duration of the war.E. S. M.May 27, 1918.Telegram from Secretary of State for India to Viceroy, Army Department27th April, 1918.Clear the line. Your telegram 5176 of the 22nd. Commissions for Indians.War Cabinet considered your proposals to-day in light of paragraph 4 of yourtelegram 5242 of the 23rd.They agree to following portions of your scheme :-1. Permanent Commissions. Ten yearly through Sandhurst as in paragraph1 of my telegram 828 of the 5th instant. Also grant of King&apos;s commissions tomaximum of 20 to selected Indian officers specially distinguished in the war, withproviso as in last part of paragraph 38 of your Despatch 57 of the 3rd August.Cabinet wish that the selection of officers should not be confined to those who have served in France, but will include all theatres.2. Honorary King&apos;s Commissions. As in paragraph 2 (c) of your telegram5176. It is presumed number you propose as establishment will be filled upgradually.3. Your further proposal to grant temporary King&apos;s commissions during thewar.up to maximum of 200 was strongly opposed on following grounds :  (i.) Effect on recruitment of British officers for the Indian army would be most harmful. Steps already taken to admit Indians have createddistrust among parents and guardians, and a large and sudden measureof this kind might dangerously affect future prosjaects.(ii.) From a military point of view the measure is unnecessary, as indian officers with commissions in the native Indian land forces possess thesame powers, except that of command of British troops, and perform the same duties in the Indian army as its British officers.(iii.) Proposal is inconsistent with opinion and warning of Government ofIndia and Commander-in-chief expressed in paragraph 40 of yourDespatch No. 57 of the 3rd August.(iv.) The political and temporary results which may be anticipated are not in military opinion here and at War Office commensurate with damagefeared to Indian army as stated above,(v.) The whole scheme for grant of King&apos;s commissions to Indians should be proceeded with cautiously, and step by step, otherwise risk of disaster isvery great. Those who have been most anxious to secure King&apos;s corn-missions for Indians have always dwelt on necessity for proceedinggradually and with great caution lest whole reform should be prejudicedor destroyed at outset. Large demand now made is in advance of preparations deemed essential to the original scheme.4. As alternative to your proposal, Cabinet is Avilling to agree to grant of cadet-ships in cadre of native Indian land forces up to maximum of 200 during the Avar,provided you are satisfied that this large number will not be embarrassing after thewar owing to the impossiblity of providing suitable military employment except fora small minority. Those considered suitable after training to be gazetted tem-porarv second lieutenants in same cadre and attached to units for regimentalduties and best of these may ultimately become eligible for King&apos;s commissionsIndian army under same proviso as for&apos;the twenty above-mentioned, and provided they have also qualified themselves by distinguished service in the field. Thispresents features which should commend themselves to Indian opinion. It is aconsiderable advance in associating Indians Avith commissioned rank and definitely11365-430] E
attaching them to units, while providing another doorway to King&apos;s permanent commisions.5. Cabinet are prepared to consider any further representations you may wishto make; but in this case they desire that full weight be given to considerations setforth above.   In particular they would desire replies to following questions :  (a.) Whether Commander-in-chief considers that Indians of real fightingcapacity and good physique can be raised to the amount mentioned inparagraph 4 of your telegram 5242,(fe.) Does Commander-in-chief consider that the granting of temporary King&apos;commission up to 200 will materially influence numbers recruited, or would concession proposed by you appeal more to political than militaryclasses, and to be unlikely to promote recruitment amongst classes whoalone have any military value?(c.) Whether he has considered probability that this large addition of indians to King&apos;s commission is likely to prejudice future recruiting of british officers of best class; and, if so, what is his answer to this objection?(d.) Whether Commander-in-chief has fully considered effect on Indian army for the future if (c) above came to be the case.6. If you wish question raised again, Cabinet desire the considered opinion ofthe Commander-in-chief on all above points, and any further reasons he or your government may desire to advance for change of view from final lines of paragraph40 of your Despatch 57 of the 3rd August last. Cabinet are prepared to consider fullreasons for proposal, but cannot at present assent to this part of your scheme.Telegram from Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,the 18th May, 1918.(6545,)1. Your telegram of the 27th ultimo, 1036. Commissions for Indians. Thefollowing is our reply to your observations. It is arranged under two heads: Part I,which deals with suggestion made in paragraph 4 of your telegram; Part II, which deals with criticisms and questions contained in paragraphs 3, 5, and 6.Part I. 2. Commander-in-chief s great objection to grant of commissions innative Indian land forces is that Indians holding such commissions cannot be utilisedin regimental capacity except under conditions which they consider humiliating. Asthey cannot command British officers or soldiers, an Indian captain holding corn-mission in native Indian land forces ranks junior for purposes of command to lastjoined British second-lieutenant holding King&apos;s commission. Indian land forceofficer is thus condemned to subordinate position throughout his career, which mustdestroy his zeal and self-confidence, besides lowering his authority and prestige. Itis for this reason that commissions of this description are so lightly esteemed.Having regard to this serious objection, we cannot admit as correct conclusionsarrived at in paragraph 3 of clause 2 of your telegram.3. Commander-in-chief recommending grant of temporary King&apos;s commissionsdesired to avoid perpetuation of irritating racial distinction above indicated. Wehold that coming after declaration made in PI ouse of Commons on the 20th August,1917, revival now of moribund native Indian land force cadre, except for purpose of granting honorary commissions, would be regarded as device for postponing fullpledge then given. We cannot, therefore, accept alternative suggested in paragraph 4of your telegram.Part II. 4. Success of recruiting depends upon so many factors thatCommander-in-chief cannot guarantee that we shall be able to recruit the half millionindicated in our telegram of the 23rd ultimo, 5242. Judging from past experience,however, he thinks that there is reasonable prospect of our being to secure recruitsof suitable physique and good fighting quality up to number proposed, provided weare able to use stimulus of commission given according to our proposals, and that weare authorised to increase sepoys&apos; emoluments for period of war. On this latter point we will address you separately.5. Owing to great expansion of army we have been obliged to modify physicalstandards in certain cases and broaden basis of our recruitment by enlisting newclasses as was suggested in vonr telegram No. 3414 of the 13th November. 1916. to judge from reports received by Commander-in-chief, and his own personal observa-
tion, this.has been carried out judiciously and without lowering fighting value of army. Some classes have not come up to expectation, but general results have been satisfactory.6. In recommending grant of temporary King&apos;s commissions, Commander-in-chief had in view desirability of recognising services to recruiting rendered by menof influence more especially in frontier province, Punjab, Northern India, andcertain native States. It is on gentlemen of this class, who nearly all belong tofighting races, that we rely for the further assistance -needed to recruit large additional numbers required. Desire for commissions is keen, and has full supportof Q&apos;Dwyer, Bikaner, Sindhia, Patiala, and others who have identified themselves with development of India&apos;s man-power. Desire is not inspired by politicalagitators, but.represents legitimate aspirations of a class which is conscious of having rendered important service to Empire, and is now anxious to prove its loyaltyby further efforts.7. Immediate grant of 200 temporary King&apos;s commissions, such as was con-templated. This total was suggested as representing maximum likely to be required during war. It was to have been worked up to gradually, recipients being selectedwith greatest care, and output limited to about fifty every six months.8. Commander-in-chief has realised all along that grant of commissions to indians might be regarded with disfavour by parents and guardians at home. this risk, however, was faced by us when at your predecessors request we formulatedproposals made in our Despatch No. 57, dated the 3rd August, 1917, and was acceptedby you when you announced in ITouse of Commons on the 20th August, 1917, removalof bar which had hitherto precluded admission of Indians to commissioned rank.9. Importance of not going too fast in this matter is fully appreciated byCommander-in-chief. For this reason, instead of suggesting bestowal on Indians oflarge number of permanent King&apos;s commissions which might have justified distrustof English parents, he deliberately advocated more cautious policy of grantingtemporary commissions. Moreover, the fact that additional commissions proposed were to be temporary not only gave guarantee that number permanently appointedwould be carefully regulated, but provided means of eliminating all officers whofailed to attain professional standard demanded or who proved themselves otherwiseunfit.10. Commander-in-chief attaches great importance to British officers of indian army being recruited from same class as heretofore. The war has made great inroadson.this class, extent of which cannot at present be estimated. This factor, however,is one which will affect post helium officering of army as a whole, and not of indian army in particular.11. Commander-in-chief&apos;s, views as expressed above, have our full, concurrence.We adhere to the opinions expressed in paragraphs 3, 4, 25, and 40 of our despatch no. 57, dated the 3rd August, 1917, as to importance of moving slowly in the matterof permanent commissions, and we entirely agree that hasty and ill-considered action might prove disastrous. We cannot admit, however, that grant of temporary corn-missions on scale suggested in paragraph 7 would entail any material departure fromcautious policy advocated in our despatch. Special situations demand special measures, and if India is to contribute to man-power of Empire on scale contemplated in Prime Minister&apos;s message, number of commissions granted to Indians should bearreasonable proportion to number of men to be recruited.12. We feel confident that disinclination of War Cabinet to accept our proposal was due primarily to the difficulty of stating within narrow compass of a telegramour reasons for. recommendations submitted. We repeat that arguments in favourof our proposals stand now in stronger prominence than when we originally submittedthem. Experience during war has taught us that among influential Indians thereare many unemployed anxious to serve the Empire and set an example of personalservice to those who look to them as their leaders. Owing to family tradition, however,they feel they cannot do so, and at the same time uphold their prestige, except asofficers holding King&apos;s commission.13. It is most important that we should retain goodwill of this class, and thattheir power should be utilised to fullest extent in interests of recruiting, and we are assured that a position in army with prospect of securing permanent commissionsin case of those found suitable will best effect this object.14. In conclusion, we would remark that we are now actively engaged in doing all that is possible to promote recruiting throughout India, and that should WarCabinet feel themselves able to accept proposals made in paragraph 7 of this tele-[1365-430] F
gram no greater encouragement could be given to martial classes, and no greaterstimulus provided to arouse zeal and activity in getting expansion of man-power.On the other hand, we must state frankly that rejection of proposals will add verymaterially to the difficulty of raising greatly increased quota of recruits we desire tofurnish.APPENDIX IIPG.T.-F752. -Indian Commissions.[Note by Pord Cukzon.]THE Secretary of State has circulated a note explaining with greater fulnessthe recent proposal of the Government of India (which was refused by the Cabinet)to give 200 temporary King&apos;s commissions to selected Indians, and we also have the reply of the Viceroy (.18th May) to our telegram (27th April j stating our objections.The Government of India renew their proposal.    We must therefore re examine it.Mr. Montagu uses the lield-marshaPs baton-in-the-knapsack argument, and says that &quot; this is a method of earning by gallantry and good conduct in the field purely temporary commissions for the term of the war only.&quot;If that were the nature and object of the commissions, no one, I think, wouldobject; for it is precisely that character of commission with which we all sympathise,and which we have already authorised with a not illiberal band since the beginningof the war.But I gather from the later passages of Mr. Montagu&apos;s note, and still more fromthe Government of India&apos;s telegram, that the proposed commissions will not be mainly of this character. The great majority of them are to be of an entirely differentdescription.The Commander-in-chief puts in the forefront the desirability of recognisingservices to recruiting rendered by men of influence, more especially in the frontier province, Punjab, N. India, and certain native States.In other words the commission will not be given for military service in the field,but is to be a reward to country gentlemen for assisting in raising the 500,000 menpromised for the Indian army in fact, a sort of Indian Deputy-Lieutenancy. Thatthis is the real ground of the proposal is again made quite clear in paragraphs 12, 13,and 14 of the Viceroy&apos;s telegram of the 18th May.Mr. Montagu further explains that these young gentlemen, if they are willing tocome with their ryots, are to be trained in Cadet Corps in order that they may take their share, if fitted, in leading those whom they have helped to secure.I turn to the earlier telegram, 20th April, for a fuller explanation of the procedure to he adopted. This telegram is not very clear, for in one place (paragraph 3) &quot;we are told-(a.) That these civilian candidates are to be nominated by Local Governments.(b.) That from the list the Commander in-chief is to select names for submission to the Viceroy.(c.) That approved candidates are&apos; then to be given temporary commissions subjectto His Majesty&apos;s approval.This undoubtedly implies that the commissions will have no connection with activemilitary service, but will be iu the nature of political rewards.But a little later we are told&apos; -1. That a fair standard of education and some knowledge of English will be demanded.2. That all nominees will undergo preliminary instruction at an officers&apos; training school, during which they will be graded and paid as cadets.3. And that only after these tests have been satisfied will the commissions begranted.These are two entirely different conceptions ; for in the one case the commission isto he the result merely of nomination, in the other of a modicum of instruction andcertain elementary tests of fitness.
In either case, however, it would appear that the commissions are to he given(a) apart from any field service ; (o) after a period of instruction that cannot fail to beutterly inadequate according to any standard hitherto applied. When the ImperialCadet Corps was founded no commissions could be won in the Indian army until after a course of three years. But the new type of officer is to be created at the rateof fifty every six months, after a preliminary training that would be deemed inadequatein any army in the world.I cannot help wondering whether this is really the type of officer that we want orthe character of commission that we ought to create. Remember that these commis-sions are to carry the right to command British troops, and British officers of lowerranks, in the field. And if the reply be that &quot; All officers are to be eliminated whofail to attain the professional standard demanded or who prove themselves otherwiseunfit,&quot; the question arises whether the bulk of the commissions thus given may nothave to be withdrawn, and whether the discontent thus aroused may not outweigh thecompliment originally conveyed.The Commander-in-chief speaks of confining this class of commission to nativegentlemen of the fighting races. I wonder whether this will be found possible.Will not the zemindars of Bengal, Madras, and other non-fighting parts of India,when they see the prize of a British commission so lightly won, urge that the doorsshould equally be open to them ? When the Commander-in-chief speaks of nominationsby local Governments, can he pick and choose between the local Governments ?I do not consider that the Commander-in-chief has given an adequate reply aboutthe probable effect on British parents of the grant of commissions thus proposed. he says that the Government faced the risk when we announced in the House of commons on the 20th August, 1917, the removal of the bar which had hitherto precludedadmission of Indians to commissioned rank. We did nothing of the kind. If theSecretary of State&apos;s reply be referred to, it will be seen that all that he did was to announce the grant of commissions to Indian officers who had served in the field,and to promise a carefully considered scheme after consultation .with the ArmyCouncil later on. No such project as this was then dreamed of, nor has it any logicalconnection with the proposals thus contemplated, and of which I was and remain themost ardent advocate.The effect of a too hasty or ill-considered grant of native commissions in Indiaupon the future officering of the Indian army cannot be ignored. It is a considerationof capital imj)ortance. The more you hand over the civil administration of India tothe Indians, the more will you have to depend in the last resort for the stability of the British connection upon the prestige and authority of the army. That army has hitherto attracted the pick of young Englishmen aspiring to a military career. InIndia soldiering was in earnest, there service was to be seen, there military famemight be won. If we in&apos;any way shake the popularity of the Indian army with our people here we shall pay a heavy price later on. It would be a poor bargain to runany such risk on the mere chance of favourably affecting recruiting in India at thepresent stage of the war.My colleagues should realise that the sentiment on the matter is universal andprofound. Only the other day I had a letter from a Lieutenant-General of fifty years&apos;service in the army,, who rose to high military command in India, and was known therefor his infl uence and popularity with the Indians. He said that he would nut sufferany relation of his to enter a service in which he might - be commanded by an Indian.This sentiment may be prejudiced or stupid, or both ; the point is that it exists andis widespread ; and that, if it is to be ignored, it should only be in cases which admitof strong defence.If the Cabinet, therefore, is to be invited by the Secretary of State to reconsiderits decision, I think we should realise exactly what we are asked to do ; and that ifthese temporary commissions are to be granted at all to the class of persons proposed,it will be most undesirable to name a total of 200. I would not myself publish anynumber. I would gladly give the commissions to those who have won them in thefield ; but I would be very chary about granting in large numbers what will in realitybe a complimentary rank, and will rest upon qualifications admittedly inferior to thosepossessed by British officers in any other part of the Empire. For this would not beto remove a racial bar, but to create a racial privilege.C. op K.June 3, 1918
