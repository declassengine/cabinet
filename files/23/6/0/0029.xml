THE Chief of the ImperiaFGeneral Staff stated that therewas nothing of importance to report relative to the Western front.2, With reference to War Cabinet 360, Minute 14, the deputy first Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that an air reconnaissance,carried out on the 6th May, indicated that the &quot; Goeben &quot; was notin the Golden Horn, Stenia Bay, or the Bosphorus, and that it was probable that she had proceeded to Odessa.3. With reference to War Cabinet 403, Minute 12, the deputy first Sea Lord stated that, from photographs taken on the previous afternoon, there was no apparent change in the lock gates at
Zeebrugge ; that the three sunken ships were in the same position ;that silt sand was prominent around the sunken ships outside the harbour, and that the Canal was still unavailable for use.Egypt. 4. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that the second british division from Egypt had safely arrived at Marseilles.5. With reference to War Cabinet 406, Minute 3, the WarCabinet had a discussion on the situation in Ireland wdth Field-Marshal Lord hrench, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, andthe Chief Secretary, prior to the departure of the former to assume the office of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.With reference to Sinn Fein intrigues with the enemy, lord french indicated that he proposed to issue, as soon as possible, a proclamation on this subject, and to follow it up by the arrest of those against whom evidence of intriguing was produced. Heoutlined the procedure he intended to take with regard to such persons as were arrested, which the War Cabinet approved. he further mentioned that the details necessary to carry out this action were being considered in conjunction with the Admiralty, the WarOffice, and the Home Office, and would be settled with those Depart-ments prior to his departure for Ireland.It was agreed that-(a.) The first point to which the Lord-Lieutenant should devotebis attention was Sinn Fein intrigues with the enemy;(6.) The Lord-Lieutenant should be prepared to deal promptlywith seditious speeches.It was pointed out, however, that to hold a meeting to organiseresistance to a prospective law was not treason.(c.) The Lord-Lieutenant should have a free hand to take suchadministrative action as he thinks fit on all questions of detail, only referring to the War Cabinet on questionsof policy.Weekly Reports. 6  With reference to War Cabinet 406, Minute 3, the WarCabinet authorised The Lord-Lieutenant to send his Weekly Reports as to the stateof Ireland direct to the War Cabinet, sending, at the sametime, a copy to the Chief Secretary and to the Secretary ofState for the Colonies.7. Attention was drawn to a question which was to be asked inthe House of Commons as to whether Field-Marshal Lord Frenchwas still in command of the Home forces.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that he was cornmuni-cating on the subject with the Secretary of State for War priorto giving a reply in the House of Commons.Command of theHome Forces.General Maurice&apos;e S. With reference to War Cabinet 406, Minute 5, the PrimeLetter to the Minister described how, in Parliament on the previous day, thePress. Opposition had not fallen in very readily with the suggestion of a judicial Enquiry, and had put down a motion for a Select Com-mittee. In his view, a Select Committee would be perfectly useless.It would be constituted on Party lines, there would merely be a party wrangle, and no judicial investigation. This raised thequestion as to whether it would not be better to-morrow to state the
facts. He understood that this was the general view of the Govern-ment&apos;s supporters in the House of Commons. There was a gooddeal to be said for it. Even if a Judicial Enquiry were set up, the controversy would not be closed. There was an undoubted desirein all parts of the House of Commons to know the facts. general maurice, the Prime Minister continued, bad made three accusationsof false statements by the Leader of the House and himself. Liehad examined the matter in some detail, and the least satisfactoryof the three issues raised, from the Governments point of view,related to the divisions in Palestine. There now seemed some doubt as to whether, on 0th April, when he made his statement,there had not been five British divisions instead of three, as he had stated. The point was not quite clear yet, and was being investigated by the War Office. He believed that one of the divisions had started to leave on 5th April for France, and that another division had been under orders. There had also been inprogress a process of the gradual incorporation of Indian divisions in the British divisions. To-day this had been carried so far thathe was informed there was only one wholly British division inPalestine. How far this process of dilution had been carried on 9th April, he had not yet been able to ascertain. Whether the factshe had stated had been correct or not, however, they had been madein good faith, and, as he had pointed out on the previous day, theWar Cabinet had been informed by the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff on 23rd March., that there were three British divisions in Egypt; General Maurice had been present; a draft of the minute had been sent him for correction and he had never returnedit. Consequently, if he (the Prime Minister) had made a mistake,it had been made on good authority and in good faith.Lord Milner said it was a terrible thing to have to announcepublicly, so that it would reach the Germans, what our policy was inregard to the divisions in Palestine. This information would be very valuable to them.The Prime Minister pointed out that this was the danger of statements and accusations made by persons with knowledge ofsecret matters.In regard to General Maurice&apos;s second accusation, relating tothe comparison of the strength of the army on the 1st Januaiy, 1918,and the 1st January, 1917, the Prime Minister stated that he had used the figures in the War Office official statistical abstract.General. Maurice&apos;s contention, however, had not been that thestatement was inaccurate, but that it implied that Sir Douglas !iaig&apos;sfighting strength on the eve of the great battle which began on the21st March, had not been diminished^ The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that on the 18th April, Sir. Godfrey Baring had put a question to Mr. Macpherson as to whether the fighting strength on the 1st January, 1.918, Avas or was not greater than on the 1stJanuary, 1917, and Mr. Macpherson had replied that the fighting strength was greater on the 1st January, 1918. Mr. Macpherson&apos;reply had been based on figures supplied by the Director of Military-Operations&apos; Department, in fact by General Maurice&apos;s own Depart-ment.   The figures had been as follows : Combatant Strength Ration strength in France. in France.January 1, 1917         ...        1,253,000 1,530,000January 1, 1918         ...        1,298,000 1,831,000Of course he could not give the actual figures in Parliament,but this material enabled him effectually to dispose of general maurice&apos;s second contention.In reply to a question as to why lie had quoted the figures for1st January instead of 1st March, 1918, the Prime. Minister said ithad been merely to give the same date in succeeding years. As amatter of fact, the figures for March were more favourable than for[1365-407] B 2
January, since the lighting strength had increased by 34,000, andthe labour strength had been somewhat reduced, owing to the comb-out of labour battalions.In regard to General Maurice&apos;s first point, namely, as to whetherthe extension of the line as carried out was ever discussed at versailles, the Prime Minister drew attention to the following statement in General Maurice&apos;s letter : &quot; I was at Versailles when the question was decided bythe Supreme War Council, to whom it had been referred.&quot;The implication was that General Maurice had been present at thediscussion, and several of those present had stated that they had understood it in this sense. As a matter of fact, the Prime ministers aid, General Maurice was in the building, but the record showed that he was not in the room when the discussion took place.&apos; Theextension of the line discussed at Versailles dealt -with the Frenchdemand that the British line should be extended to Berry-au-Bac,and the recommendation of the Military Representatives that itshould extend to the River Ailette, but not with the extension toBarisis, which had already been settled between Field-Marshal haig and General Petain. In fact, in the course of the Conference Field-Marshal Haig had informed the Supreme War Council &quot; That during the recent battle in Flanders he had, at general Petaims request, agreed to and had now extended thefront, first to the Oise and afterwards to Barisis..&quot;The questions and answers in Parliament on 23rd April had allreferred to the Barisis extension; and not to the further extensiondiscussed by the Supreme War Council, which, in fact, had never been carried out.The main point on which the Prime Minister wished to consult his colleagues was as to whether he should limit his speech on thefollowing day to answer General Maurice&apos;s specific accusations, orwhether he should extend it so as to cover the whole history of theextension of the British line.In favour of the first proposal, it was pointed out that therewere great advantages in limiting the statement, in order that fewerpersons might become involved ; the statement on wider groundscould not be made without involving Field-Marshal Haig andGeneral Robertson.Mr. Balfour said that Mr. Asquith would speak first, and heundoubtedly would cover the wide held, so that the Prime minister should be prepared in that sense.Mr. Bonar Law pointed out that the first paragraph of general maurice&apos;s letter really raised the wider issue. The full summary ofthe circumstances, which had been circulated by the Secretary,appeared to him to dispose of any suggestion that the Governmenthad acted improperly in the matter.In the course of the discussion it was generally agreed that theGovernment had in fact a complete answer to their critics, but thatthe statement of the Parliamentary answer was difficult, owing tothe obligation not to give information to the enemy.General Smuts laid great stress on this aspect of the question.In replying to General Maurice&apos;s second charge, it was, he said,essential not to give figures. Even to give the difference betweenthe numbers in January 1918 and the numbers in January .1917would assist the enemy. It was also most objectionable to giveparticulars of the numbers of British divisions in Palestine and mesopotamia, or to mention the process of diluting them with indian battalions.Lord Curzon suggested that on these points a reply might bemade that the Prime Minister would have been, quite willing tosubmit his evidence to an Enquiry by Judges if that course hadcommended itself to the House of Commons, but that, as this had
been rejected, he could not take the responsibility of stating openlyin Parliament information which would be of value to the enemy.The Secretary of State for the Colonies urged that nothing should he said which would seem to impugn the actions of Field-Marshal Sir D. Haig, General Robertson, or other soldiers, as this-would only prolong and embitter the controversy.Great stress was laid on the importance of making the state-ment in a form which would give satisfaction to Field-Marshal sir douglas Haig. It must he made quite clear that Field-MarshalHaig had not wished to take over any additional portion of the line.Undoubtedly Field-Marshal Haig had felt that he was under an obligation to take over some of the line, owing to the decision of theBoulogne Conference on the 25th September, 1917, and to the urgent pressure of the French Go\&apos;ernment and French militaryauthorities, and he had very properly been influenced in his decision by the opinions thus expressed. While this was not denied, it waspointed out that it was clear, in the Secretary&apos;s summary, that afterthe 25th September the War Cabinet had at no time put any pressure whatsoever upon Field-Marshal Haig in the matter; thatthey had resisted all attempts on the part Of the French Govern-ment to induce them to put such pressure ; and that the amount ofand precise time for the extension had always been left entirely toField-Marshal Haig and General Petain.Attention was also draAvn to the interpretation that general robertson had placed on the Boulogne Conference, namely, that thematter could not he regarded as decided, and that Field-MarshalHaig had admitted that this presented the conclusion arrived at onthe 25th September in a different light from the official record.The Prime Minister invited Lord Milner and Mr. Chamberlainto meet him in the afternoon to consider more in detail thecharacter of the statement which he should make in theHouse of Commons. He hoped by that time to have prepared a rough draft.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 8, 1918.
