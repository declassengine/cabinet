The western front.1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported, with the aid of a map, that, after a heavy bombardment yesterday morningfrom the line Leuilly, north of Soissons, to Brimont, north of Rheims,the enemy had attacked on a 50-kilomel re front, and had advanced to an extreme depth of 14 miles and an average depth of about miles. They had apparently crossed the Chemin des Dames,the Aisne, the next rise, and the River Vesle. Up to last night,15 divisions had been identified, and there may have been another 5,making &apos;J.0 in all. There were 4 of our divisions, 3 in the frontline and Tin reserve. The Trench had 3, and possibly 4, divisions in front, with 3 in the rear, making 10, 11, or 12 divisions, as far as was now known. Nothing was yet known of the losses in men orguns, hut it seemed probable that a large number of guns musthave been lost. The British had given up much less ground thanthe French, but whether this was due to a heavier attack on theFrench was not known. Tanks and gas were mentioned as havingbeen used by the enemy. General Foch was moving up 5 divisions.Possibly the enemy hoped that the Allied reserves would be tempted to come down from the north, and, in view of their initial success, itwas possible that the enemy would convert the present attack into their main offensive, with Paris as its objective. The reverse was asubstantial one, and disquieting from the point of view of the moral of the troops. The Chemin des Dames and the line of the Aisnewere very strong lines.Next Meeting ofthe Supreme WarCouncil.2. With reference to War Cabinet 416, Minute 2, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff stated that a telegram had been receivedfrom M. Clemenceau, inviting Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig andhis Chief of Staff to the next Meeting of the Supreme War council at Versailles.It was pointed out that, in view of the military situation on theWestern front, Versailles might prove to be an inconvenientmeeting place for the Generals, and it was agreed to await develop-ments before finally fixing on the place of meeting.Palestine:Enemy Casualties.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that between31st October, 1.917, and 21st May, 1918, it was estimated that wehad inflicted 75,500 gross casualties on the,enemy in Palestine. Ofthis number, 0,200 were killed, and 20,300 were prisoners.Submarines.4. The First Sea Lord informed the AVar Cabinet that (a.) With reference to War Cabinet 418, Minute 2 (d), further details had been received, confirming the report of the sinking of a submarine by the armed yacht &quot; Lorna.&quot;One survivor had been recovered, who stated that thesubmarine was the &quot; U. 74.&quot;(&amp;.) A report had been received from Santander that the pro-pellers, rudder, engine parts, and spare gear were being-removed from the interned submarine &quot; U. 56.&quot;The steamship&quot; Teasowe Castle.&quot;5. The First Sea Lord reported the sinking, by torpedo, of thesteamship &quot; Leasowe Castle,&quot; with 3,200 troops on. board, about100 miles from Alexandria, at 10-30 r.m. on the ^6th May. 2,400troops had been rescued, and it was reported that the remainder were in boats. The transport was on her way to France, and wasone of five ships escorted by six destroyers.
Austrian Dread-nought torpedoed.7. With reference to War Cabinet 413, Minute 9, the First sea lord said that no confirmation of the sinking of an AustrianDreadnought had been received. The Austrians had issued no reports on the subject.The western front:Questions inParliament.8. Lord Curzon raised the question of the use of French andBritish troops held in reserve and in the fighting line. Lord Curzonsaid that he was under the impression that, taking the front line from the sea down to the Somme, British troops were being used todo all the fighting in this sector, whilst the French troops were heldin reserve. He thought that there was a good deal of feeling in thecountry on this point, and iie anticipated that questions might beasked in parliament in reply, it was stated that die sector from the sea to the Sommewas the British sector, and that it was only natural that Britishtroops should do most of the fighting. When an attack took placein the sector held by the French, as in the case of the presentattack on the Ohemin des Dames, the French troops did most of thefighting.It was pointed out that eleven French divisions were being used in the North, and that the line recently held by us on the somme was now almost exclusively held by French troops.Supplies to the 9. Lord Curzon also raised the question of the supply of the armies in France. Allied Forces in France. He said that there was now a long line inwhich British, French, and American troops were interspersed, andthe question of their supply naturally arose. He feared that weshould have a very strong demand made upon us for the unity ofthe supply services.It was stated that Lord Milner was now in Paris discussing thisquestion, but that there -was little fear of our having to hand overthe control of our supply services to one of our Allies. In thisrespect we had all the cards in our own hands, inasmuch as the supplyof the whole of the armies in France would break down were it not for shipping, over which we had complete control.The Prime Minister said that this problem would probably beraised at the next meeting of the Supreme War Council.Exchange of 10. With reference to War Cabinet 417, Minute 17, the WarPrisoners of War.      Cabinet had under consideration a memorandum by Lord Newton ona proposed exchange of combatant and civilian prisoners between england and Germany (Paper G.T.-4667).Lord Newton stated that it was a matter for the Cabinet todecide (a.), Whether they would make an exchange on the same lines as had recently been agreed upon by the French ; and(b.) Who shotdd be sent to The Hague to represent the BritishGovernment in such an eventuality.He added that there were approximately 35,000 British non-com-missioned officers and men who had been in captivity for overeighteen months, the German, figures being approximately the same.As regards combatant prisoners, we had in our hands, both here and[1365-419] B 2The Adriatic. 6. The First Sea Lord stated that a report had jnst been received of. a successful attack by aeroplane on a destroyer at Durazzo. the destroyer had been directly hit, and had been seen to turn over andsink. This was the first time that such a result had been observedwith absolute certainty.
in France, abcmt 124,000, and the British combatant prisoners inGerman hands were at the present moment believed to be over180,000. With regard to civilians, there were about 21,000 internedhere, and about 10,000 interned in the Dominions. On the otherhand, there were only about 4,000 British civilians interned inGermany. With regard to the claims of the Admiralty that navalsubmarine ratings should not be exchanged, Lord Newton consideredthat this could be achieved by releasing rather more german civilians than would be the case in a man-for-man exchange. LordNewton stated that the proceedings in carrying out any exchange,such as had been suggested, would be very lengthy.Attention, was drawn to telegram No. 1929 of the 27th May,1918, from The Hague, which indicated that General Friederich had,on behalf of the German Government, expressed himself willing totake part in a conference to deal with the repatriation of prisoners,and such other subjects as might be raised.With reference to the question as to whether, if we effectedexchanges, the Germans would carry out their part of the contractnot to employ men (a.) On the front,(fc.) On lines of communication,(c.) In occupied territory,General Belfield suggested that they might use their releasedcombatant prisoners and civilians in Russia, and advance the pleathat, as they were at peace with Russia, the men were not being employed on military operations. This would result in combatantsbeing released from the German troops on the Eastern front for employment on the Western front. General Belfield stated, how-ever, that there was nothing to prevent our using any of ournon-commissioned officers and men that might be released for thepurpose of training troops preparing for the front, and that therewas no objection to their being sent abroad, to, say, India and gibraltar, and they might also be sent to Ireland for recruiting-purposes. General Belfield further mentioned that the militarymembers of the&apos; Army Council were averse, on military grounds,to any exchange of prisoners, and he understood that it was their intention to put forward, for the information of the War Cabinet,their reasons for tins view. He also pointed out that, if we enteredinto an exchange agreement with the Germans, although 35,000might represent the number of combatants now over eighteen months in captivity, and therefore likely to be exchanged if agreement was reached between the two Giovernments, the terms ofthe French agreement were such that the longer the war went onthe more men we should release, inasmuch as the Germans wouldprobably endeavour to come to a&quot; running agreement &quot; with us, asthey had done in regard to their arrangements with the French.General Belfield concluded by stating that, in his opinion, if it was explained to our prisoners in Germany that by being released fromcaptivity they would materially assist the Germans, they would one and all refuse to accept such release.As against these arguments against an agreement, it waspointed out that, owing to the French having reached one with theGermans, we were placed in an extremely difficult position, moreparticularly as our number of prisoners was far smaller than thoseof the French, and, consequently, public opinion would be strongly opposed to the French prisoners in this matter receiving preferential treatment, although it was pointed out that there was some evidence,given by prisoners who had escaped from Ruble ben, indicating thattheir lot was not such a hard one as recent publications in the press had led the British public to imagine.The First Lord hoped that, if any exchange was negotiated,all German submarine prisoners should be eliminated from theterms of any agreement, and pointed out that, if we were called
upon to release those prisoners now in our hands, it would be equivalent to giving the Germans efficient crews for ten submarines.The Prime Minister suggested that, in any agreement arrivedat, we should follow generally the lines of the recently concludedFranco-German agreement, and thus throw the responsibility largely on to the French, and that, at the same time, he should take anearly opportunity of informing M. Clemenceau of our views in thismatter, and of the effect that any considerable exchange of prisonerswould have on the available man-power of Germany during the nextyear.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) British delegates should be sent to The Hague to discuss with the German delegates certain urgent questions relating to prisoners of war, and that, amongst othermatters, they should consider a wide scheme of exchangeof prisoners, following generally the lines of the recently concluded Franco-German agreement, but omitting anyconsideration of the release of German submarineprisoners now in this country.(b.) An announcement to this effect should be made in bothHouses of Parliament.(c.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should informthe British Minister at The Hague of the War cabinets decision.(d.) The Prime Minister should discuss the matter withM. Clemenceau at the first convenient opportunity.(e.) The question as to what delegates should represent theBritish Government should be ftirther considered bythe War Cabinet after receiving the views of theAdmiralty and the War Office in the matter.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 28, 1918.
