In continuation of War Cabinet 420, Minute 1, the Chiefont- of the Imperial General Staff informed the War Cabinet that 24German divisions had been identified on that portion of the western front in which the present offensive was taking place. Four of these were fresh divisions, and 20 were those that had been in action on the somme and had had at least a month&apos;s rest. Behind these 24divisions were 5 fresh divisions, and a further 13 who had been inaction on the Somme or in the vicinity of Ypres, but who had hadless than a month to recover. As regards the employment of other divisions, the situation was being closely watched, with a view to ascertaining whether the Germans were chawing on their troops tothe north and east of the present offensive area. Between Rheims[1365-421] B
and Switzerland the Germans had 5 fresh divisions in reseiwe and 12divisions in line ; consequently they had an available force of 35divisions without touching those to the northward. The Chief of.the Imperial General Staff added that Soissons had been taken, andthat the best German divisions were fighting in that vicinity, which appeared to indicate that they were throwing more weight on thatflank, with a view to turning the Montdidier-Noyon line. he added that if the Germans were able to force the French to retirea distance of about 15,000 yards, they would obtain the use of therailway, which, would be an advantage to them.At a later stage of the meeting the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff reported that the Germans had now advanced another2 miles or so beyond Fere-en-Tardenois. He also reported that theGermans had captured Rheims.The Italian Front.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that two more Austrian divisions had arrived from Russia,that one had been sent to the Brenta and the other to the LowerPiave. Lord cavan had reported that there were further indications of an enemy concentration on the Piave, but that he was sure, if an offensive were started in that locality, another would also be carriedout by the Austrians on the Breuta.Salonica.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that General Woollcombe had reported that the French were taking away from the Salonica front some 12,000 French troops.The Prime Minister pointed out that at the meeting of theSupreme War Council at Abbeville the French had made the strongestprotests against the withdrawal of British troops, and that theywere now taking away French troops without a word of warning to us.The Chief of trie Imperial General Staff considered that no action was necessary at the moment, as General Woollcombe indicated that, if Indian battalions were sent, a few British battalions could be withdrawn.Submarines. 4. The Deputy First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet thatpatrol craft No. 65 had attacked a submarine with depth chaigesduring the night of the 27th May in the Irish Channel, with theresult that the submarined hull broke surface, showing 20 to 30 feet of side, and apparently turning over. The explosion of the thirddepth charge dropped by the patrol craft was followed by a secondexplosion, which indicated the probable loss of the submarine.Ireland : 5. jj0rj Milner informed the War Cabinet that, whilst in Paris,Agricultural M,   Clemenceau   had  told  him  that  the  French  anticipated a labour for France, magnificent harvest this year, but that they were very short oflabour to bring it in. He had suggested the possibility of tiie use of irish labour for this purpose, and had pointed out that the effect inIreland might be very beneficial. A proposition of the Irishharvesters might, as a result of their association with the french people, be moved to volunteer for military service for the defence ofFrance.Ireland.6. With reference to War Cabinet 412, Minute 18, the PrimeMinister stated that, on the previous day, he had learned that a proclamation was about to be issued by the Irish Government, to theeffect that 20,000 volunteers ought to be forthcoming by the1st August next.   Air. Lloyd George said that he had felt grave
doubts as to whether it was expedient bo mention so low a figure atpresent, and bad arranged for the suspension of the Proclamationuntil the War Cabinet had had an opportunity of considering thequestion. Mr. Lloyd George expressed the opinion that to put solow a figure as 20,000 would create the impression that the Govern-ment was not in earnest in the policy of compulsory military service.The Chief Secretary for Ireland explained that he had not acopy of the Proclamation with him, but that, as regards the numberof 20,000 mentioned, he had been in communication with all theauthorities in Ireland, including the Registrar-General and the Headof Recruiting. This question had been discussed at the CouncilMeetings of the Irish Executive, and he had come to the conclusionthat, after paying due regard to the claims of food production and agriculture, it would be wise to insert this number of volunteers, whowould be recruited by the 1st August, and also to state that it was expected that further recruits, to the number of 3,000 a month,&apos;would attest after that date. Mr. Shortt said that, in his opinion,it was important to name a figure, as, unless this were done,uncertainty as to the actual requirements would be left in Ireland,and it was doubtful if Ireland would, pay any attention to the proclamation at all. Mr. Shortt added that the Proclamation made it clear that this was an appeal to the young men from the towns, ofages from 18 to 25, and that it was proposed to say that we werenot seeking to interfere with agriculture and essential industries.Mr. Long said the real difficulty was that no one could tell theChief Secretary what was the maximum number of free men whichcould be procured from Ireland. He pointed out that 1-g- million acres of grassland had been broken up for food production, and thatIrish farming differed entirely from that of Great Britain, as the farms consisted mainly of small holdings, which the farmers cultivatedthemselves. It was also doubtful if many men could be spared fromUlster, if the maximum products of the industries there were to beproduced. Mr. Long said that he had been informed that, even ifconscription were working smoothly in Ireland, not more than 70,000to 80,000 men could be called up, many of whom would be rejectedon physical grounds. Mr. Long expressed the hope that the cabinet would agree to the number of 20,000 being inserted, pointing outthat, if the number was put too high, it would be in excess of whatthe people in Ireland thought was right, but if fairly low the scheme would not only probably succeed, but also a larger number than thenumber named woirld possibly enlist.Mr. Bonar Law pointed out that it would be immediately askedin the House of Commons if this proposal meant the end of theGovernment policy of conscription in Ireland.The Prime Minister said that while the answer to that could bein the negative, yet it would be said that Ireland, if it responded tothe appeal, was doing so to avoid conscription, and that was why he did not think the figure of 20,000 was sufficiently high, for, if it werehigh enough, it would be possible to say that it was not necessary toenforce the Military Service Act in Ireland. Mr. Lloyd George saidthat it had always been considered that if 50,000 recruits were obtained in Ireland it would be a good start, and be would prefer that figure to 20,000. At the same time he would prefer that nofigure should be given at all, that the results of the Proclamationshould be watched, and that the Government would then be able toconsider the situation afresh, and whether the response was adequate.He pointed out that it was not possible to exclude the rural areas and only take into consideration the industrial centres, as there hadbeen no emigration from Ireland for three-and a half years, and thatthere were doubtless large numbers of young men who, had it notbeen for the war, would probably have left for the United States.It was uiost undesirable to confine the appeal to towns and cities,particularly as it was the men in the rural areas who were giving themost trouble in Ireland.[1365-421j B 2
Lord Milner took strong exception even to the figure of 50,000,pointing out that, even if this figure were attained, Ireland wouldnot be making an equivalent response to that made by GreatBritain.In the. discussion which ensued as to the number of men withinthe present limits of military age, fit for general service who couldbe recruited in Ireland, it was pointed out that the Minister ofNational Service had given his estimate as 250,000 (War Cabinet372, Minute 13).Mr. Long stated that he did not know how Sir Auckland Geddeshad arrived at this number, as he understood that no medicalexaminations had been held in Ireland.Both Mr. Barnes and General Smuts said that, having regardto the difficulties in applying the Military Service Act to Ireland,they were inclined to support the Irish Government in their proposal.Mr. Long, in agreeing with them, said that he did not think the War Cabinet realised the state of affairs in Ireland, and that itwas surely better to get 20,000 men quietly without the serious trouble which must ensue if conscription were enforced.Mr. Shortt asked whether he might discuss the question againwith the Viceroy on his return to Ireland, and if it were decided toput the number of &quot; 50,000&quot; into the Proclamation, how many months would the War Cabinet agree to for raising that number ?Mr. Shortt aiso suggested that it would be worth while for theMinister of National Service to proceed to Ireland, where he could help the Government with his large experience, and where he wouldhave an opportunity of confirming the figures he had given to theWar Cabinet as to the number of men available. There was another point which must be discussed soon, and that was thequestion of the training of the men raised. He was strongly ofopinion that the men raised in Ireland should be trained in Ireland,but he understood that the War Office did not agree with that view.The Prime -Minister suggested that the Irish Government shouldalso consider the advisability of opening recruiting in Ireland formen in low medical categories for the Army Service Corps andLabour Battalions, who would be invaluable, and wrere very urgently needed at the present time.The War Cabinet, while reluctant to override the Irish Govern-ment, decided that (a.) The limit of 20,000 named in the Proclamation was altogetherinadequate;(b.) If a figure at all was mentioned, it should not be less than50,000; but, in the opinion of the War Cabinet, if possibleno number should be mentioned, and the adjective&quot; adequate &quot; should be used ;(c.) If the Irish Executive desired to alter the date in the proclamation from the &quot; 1st August,&quot; their proposals onthis subject should be submitted to the War Cabinet ;(d.) The Chief Secretary for Ireland should submit to the WarCabinet a new scheme for recruiting ;(e.) The Irish Government should consider immediately thedesirability of opening recruiting for the Army SeiwiceCorps, Labour Battalions, and similar units;(/.) The Chief Secretary for Ireland should confer with theMinister of National Service with reference to the desir-ability of the latter visiting Ireland at an early date inorder to confer with the Irish Executive in regard torecruiting and the numbers available.allied intervention in siberia.7. With reference to War Cabinet 420, Minute 7, the WarCabinet had under consideration the following documents in regardAllied intervention in Siberia : 
Note of Conversation between Japanese Ambassador andLord Robert Cecil (Paper G.T.-4617).Telegrams between General Bridges and the War Office(Paper G.T.-4662).Memorandum by Lord Robert Cecil on Baron Goto&apos;s telegramof the 19th May, 19*18 (Paper G.T.-4617), (Paper G.T.-4663).The Prime Minister said that it was essential for the Govern-ment to be prepared with some definite proposal on this question, tobe laid before the Supreme War Council.In this connection two memoranda - one from the Secretary ofState for- Foreign Affairs and one from the Minister of Blockade came under consideration.1 ord Robert Cecil pointed out that in his paper he had sub-mitted that the Government should ask the Supreme War Councilto express a strong view in favour of intervention, and to get its opinion endorsed, in as strong language as possible, by General Fochand the other Allied military authorities. He had also suggestedthat it would greatly assist our cause if we could get from theJapanese a definite statement that they were prepared to intervene in support of Allied interests generally, and that it would be worthwhile to enquire from the Japanese Ambassador here whether he could give an answer to the questions which he had put to him last week.Lord Robert Cecil also said that he had pointed out that he considered it desirable to send General Knox over to America immediately.The attention of the War Cabinet was also drawn to an interview, which was published in the press that morning, between the&quot;Daily Mail&quot; special correspondent in the Far East and BaronGoto, the Japanese Foreign Minister.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in speaking of his memorandum, said that the conclusion at which he had arrived wasthat, if the United States of America refused to co-operate with theAllies, assistance to Russia would have to be confined to what wecould do at Archangel and Murmansk, and by diplomacy andpromises of material and financial assistance. Mr. Balfour said thathe had asked whether, supposing Japan were ready to come inwithout America, and that America, while refusing for her own part to take any share, in the. policy, was prepared to regard it withbenevolent acquiescence, we should in these circumstances be justifiedin pressing on the scheme.The Prime Minister asked if it was quite clear that america would refuse to co-operate if strong representations were made by theSupreme War Council, especially if these representations were basedon military arguments. He called attention to a telegram from lord Reading on this subject (No. 2338, of the 24th May, 1918), inwhich Lord Reading had said that he found President Wilson quitedecided in the opinion that the moment for the intervention wasinopportune, and that he had the support, in this opinion, of his military advisers, who supported his views expressed previously, thatno military advantage would be gained by intervention.Lord Robert Cecil, refersing to recent telegrams from Mr. Lock-hart, said that Mr. Lockhart had become genuinely terrified of the advance of the Germans into Russia, and that he was of the opinionthat, unless the Allies took some action, the whole of Russia was going over to Germany. In this connection he called attention to atelegram from Mr. Lockhart (No. 219, of the 25th May), in which mr Lockhart said it was becoming increasingly clear that, with thechange in Germany&apos;s policy towards the Bolsheviks, intervention would be extremely problematical. Mr. Lockhart had added that itwas therefore extremely important that intervention itself should behurried on as quick!v as possible.Mr. Chamberlain pointed out that what might be called thetwo extreme contingencies had been considered, namely, on theone hand, that President Wilson should be pressed by General Foch
and the Versailles Council to co-operate whole-heartedly and sendAmerican troops, and, on the other, ii he refused this proposal, thatthe Japanese should be encouraged to intervene, assisted by Frenchand English, in spite of President VVilsoids opposition. But therewas a third contingency which did not seem to him to have beenfully considered, namely, that President Wilson, whilst unwilling tosend any American troops, or to participate actively in intervention,might he induced to regard intervention by Japan and the other allies with good-will.Lord Robert Cecil pointed out that there was an unlimitednumber of variations between protest and support, even if therewere acquiescence on the part of President Wilson, that might meanveiled hostility. President Wilson might, however, in view of thedifficulties with which he was faced in putting American troops under the Japanese flag, while unable to join in a joint Proclamation,issue one of his own, and, while unable to send troops, yet might give technical assistance. Lord Robert Cecil expressed the viewstrongly that, in view of the desperate state of affairs in Russia,he was very doubtful of the success of the Allied forces in the war,unless a revolution occurred in Austria or Germany. Lord robert cecil suggested that Mr. Balfour should see the Japanese Ambas-ambassador, and ask him whether the Japanese would intervene with american approval.Mr. Baifour said that he had sent a telegram to colonel house, embodying one which he desired to send to the british ambassador at Tokio, and asking if Colonel House saw any objection to his making an appeal to the Japanese on these lines.Colonel House did object, and consequently Mr. Balfour had not sent the telegram.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff and Mr. PhilipKerr should draft a memorandum, to be laid before theSupreme War Council, putting forward the arguments in full in favour of Allied intervention in Siberia ;(6.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should comrnuni-cate with Lord Reading, asking him for his opinion as tothe advisability of General Knox being sent to America.Repatriation of 8. The War Cabinet had before them a report of a meeting heldRussian Subjects. at the Ministry of Shipping on the 24th May, 1918, in regard to there patriation of Russian subjects (Paper G.T.-4676). The meeting had agreed that, while the present situation continued, the Ministryof Shipping should only accept requisitions for passages to north russia (other than Military and Naval personnel proceeding on duty)from the Director of Military Intelligence or the Director of NavalIntelligence, and that, for convenience, the Foreign Office would arrange for any requisitions for passages they may desire to make tobe sent to the Ministry of Shipping, through the Director of military intelligence.The War Cabinet decided that The conclusions reached at the meeting, and recorded in thereport, should be confirmed and communicated to theGovernment Departments concerned.Reduction in theNumber of Horsesin the allied armies, and in theOats and HayRation.9. The War Cabinet took note of Joint Note No. 26 to theSupreme war Council by its Military Representatives, in regard tothe reduction in the number of horses in the Allied armies, and in theoats and hav ration.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 30, 1918.
