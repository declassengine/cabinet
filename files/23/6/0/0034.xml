Horse Racing. 1. WITH reference to War Cabinet 402, Minute 12, the WarCabinet had before them the report on horse-racing by the Presidentof the Board of Trade, with memoranda from the Army Counciland the Ministry of Food (Paper G.T.-4518).The War Cabinet decided To ask Lord Curzon, together with Mr. Prothero and Sir albert stanley, to meet representatives of the Jockey Club ; and,subject to any representations made on behalf of theJockey Club which Lord Curzon considered would modifythem, the War Cabinet approved the recommendations setforth in the report of the President of the Board of Trade,namely : That no flat racing should be allowed, except atNewmarket, after the 1st June ; that race meetings underthe rules of the National Hunt Committee should not beallowed during the ensuing winter season ; that no extratrains should be run to Newmarket for the conveyance ofracegoers, or tickets sold to Newmarket beyond the capacity of the ordinary trains.Proposed Issue of 2. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theHorseflesh to Secretary of State for War dealing with a suggestion to substitute^risoners      horseflesh for beef and mutton in the rations issued to enemy0     ar&apos; prisoners of war in this country (Paper G.T.-4515\The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to the difficultyof obtaining adequate meat supplies during the next few months,and to the desirability of using horseflesh for sausage, unless therewere statutory objections.The War Cabinet were of opinion that there was no serious objection to the issue of horseflesh to enemy prisoners of war, and decided To leave the matter to the Secretary of State for War to takewhat course he thought fit.Provision of Land .3. The War Cabinet had before them the following documentsfor Settlement and with regard to the provision of land for soldiers on demobili-other Purposes. sation : Memorandum by Mr. Prothero (Paper Gf.T.-2225).Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction (Paper G.T.-4479).Memorandum by the President of the Board of Agriculture andFisheries (Paper G.T.-4481).Joint Memorandum by the above (Paper G.T.-4494).Note by the Minister of Reconstruction covering resolutions of advisory Council, Section IV (Paper G.T.-4485).Mr. Prothero explained that in his memorandum dated the2nd October, 1917 (Paper G.T.-2225), he had not proposed to resort to compulsory acquisition of land except in the case of certainglebe lands. He had proposed to begin by appointing a commis-sioner, who would privately approach the larger landowners of thecountry and ask each of them to have a survey made of his estate,and to report what portions, large or small, he would be prepared to cut off and dispose of to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries forland settlement. Similar negotiations might be opened up withrepresentatives of colleges and hospitals. He had also suggested inthe same memorandum that (if necessary with the aid of legislation)the Board should be empowered to enter into agreements with land-owners for the extinction of existing tithe-rent charge upon their land by exchange for a proportionate amount of land. Sincewriting the memorandum referred to, as the result of furtherconsideration, he had agreed that, for certain limited purposes, it
might be desirable to have compulsory powers ; and the proposals on which he and the Minister of Reconstruction were agreed hadbeen set forth in their joint memorandum (Paper G.T.-4494),where, inter alia, the sanction of the Cabinet was asked to proposals (a.) To acquire compulsoriiy any land needed for land settle-ment, demonstration and experiment, afforestation andreclamation, and the development of rural industries.(b.) To acquire by voluntary agreement adjoining land needed in connection with, though not directly for, the specifiedpurposes.The compulsory powers, it was suggested, should be limited forthe purpose of (i.) Carrying out schemes of land settlement and the develop-ment of rural industries,(ii.) Promoting and extending forestry,(iii.) Reclaiming waste land.(iv.) Providing for housing accommodation connected with anyof the foregoing objects.Dr. Addison stated that an objection to the policy originallysuggested by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries was that itsingled out glebe lands for special treatment, and that this might lead to much undesirable controversy. He felt that it was better not to single out one form of land, ft should be borne in mmd thatthe taking of compulsory powers did not exclude negotiations on a voluntary basis. On the other hand, experience showed that itwould not be easy to obtain the large amount of land which mightbe required without resort to compulsion. He laid special stress onthe limitations on compulsory action set forth in section 9 of thejoint memorandum (Paper G.T.-4494).Lord Curzon thought that the proposals before the cabinet were of a serious character, and stated that it was essential, if theBill embodying them were not to come to grief in the House ofLords, that any objections to them by the landed interest should be carefully weighed in advance.Mr. Chamberlain suggested that the policy under considerationrequired careful and detailed examination, and he thought that could best be given by a Cabinet Committee.The Secretary for Scotland stated that he had not had anopportunity of discussing the proposals with the Board of agriculture for Scotland, and was not therefore able to offer a considered opinionupon them.The War Cabinet decided that The matter, including the proposals contained in paper g.T.-4479 on the acquisition of land for small holdings, should bereferred to the following Committee : Sir George Cave (Chairman),Mr. Prothero,Mr. Munro,Dr. Addison,Mr- Hayes Fisher,Mr. Walter Long, andA Representative of the Treasury,the Chairman to have power to add further members to theCommittee, and, if Mr. Long should be unable to serve, toarrange for a representative of the landed interest in mr. Long&apos;s place.The United States 4. With reference to War Cabinet 411, Minute 11, the SecretaryArmy. of State for Home Affairs called the attention of the War Cabinet toa cable, addressed to the &quot; Morning Post,&quot; which had been submitted
parliamentary procedure.Position of conciliation and arbitration board in relation to claims for12^ per cent.Bonus.League of Nations.to the Press Bureau. The question arose as to whether it shouldbe issued without some sort of explanation on the part of theGovernment.The War Cabinet decided that The Press Bureau should issue a confidential note to the pressexplaining that a blunder had been made, that it had nowbeen set right, and that it was not desirable that thereshould be any public comment on the matter.5. With reference to War Cabinet 324, Minute 14, the WarCabinet had before them a memorandum by the Minister of reconstruction (Paper G.T.-3060), and a memorandum by theMinister of Reconstruction covering a rejxirt of Sir George Cave&apos;conference on the subject of Parliamentary Procedure (paper g.T.-4432).Sir George Cave said that he had presided over a conference toconsider what steps should be taken to deal at short notice withemergency measures, which, in the absence of legislation to thecontrary, would lapse either on the termination of the war or at various periods thereafter. The Conference was of opinion that thebest method of procedure would be the appointment of a SelectCommittee of the House of Commons to consider and report as tothe steps to be taken. This course would have the advantage of preparing the ground, and of anticipating discussion in the House.If a Bill were introduced without such preliminary preparationthere would be certain to be a large number of amendments. Itmight be possible to have a Bill which would leave it to be settled by Order in Council as to what was meant by &quot;end of the war,&quot;and to extend or shorten the period as might be required in eachcase.Dr. Addison said that there were a large number of Acts and regulations in which the phrase &quot; end of the war,&quot; or variations ofit, occurred, and it was necessary to come to some clear under-standing for extending or shortening the period of operation of suchstatutes and any regulations made thereunder.Mr. Chamberlain suggested that it might be preferable to havea Joint Committee of the two Houses rather than a Select Com-mittee of the House of Commons. He thought that a Joint committee could be set up by resolution, and that a Bill would not be necessary.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) Provided no Act of Parliament were required, a JointCommittee of both Houses should be setup, to consider andreport as to the steps to be taken to deal with emergencywar measures ; but if an Act were required, then a SelectCommittee of the House of Commons alone should be setup. The necessary action should be initiated by theSecretary of State for Home Affairs.(o.) The Departments concerned should furnish to the Ministerof Reconstruction as soon as possible information as to legislation which they may desire to be prolonged.6. With reference to War Cabinet 308, Minute 15, the WarCabinet took note of a memorandum by the Conciliation and Arbitra-tion Board in relation to claims for 12^ per cent, bonus, and they approved the steps taken by Mr. Barnes in the matter.7. With reference to War Cabinet 368, Minute 17, the WarCabinet had before them the Interim Report of Sir Walter Philli-more&apos;s Committee on the League of Nations (Paper G.T.-4454).Lord Curzon stated that the House of Lords debate on thesubject had been adjourned in response to a request from lord Parmoor, who thought that it was not appropriate to discuss
Propaganda inIreiand.8. With reference to War Cabinet 398, Minute 10f calling attention to the entire absence of an organised system of propaganda in Ireland, the War Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary(Paper G.T.-4540), which raised the question whether the Ministryof Information shordd extend its propaganda activities to Ireland.The War Cabinet referred the question to Mr. Long for decision,in consultation with the Minister of Information and theChief Secretary for Ireland.Submarines.9. The First Sea Lord informed the Cabinet that (a.) The British submarine &apos;: E. 35 &quot; reported having torpedoed and sunk in the Atlantic, &quot;West of Gibraltar, on 11thMay, a German submarine cruiser.(o.) The transport &quot; Nidd &quot; rammed a submarine just off theRoyal Sovereign Lightship, after which the submarineappeared on the surface in a sinking condition.10. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that four british de Haviland machines had carried out a bombing attack onDurazzo on 13th May, bombs being dropped on a seaplane and onheadquarters. In the afternoon of the same day six Italian seaplanesalso bombed Durazzo.   All machines had returned.The naval Raid on 11. With reference to War Cabinet 407, Minute 3, the FirstZeebrugge. gea Lord stated that, as the result of an air reconnaissance, four destroyers were seen alongside the mole at Zeebrugge, and that adredger was between the block ships. Two large submarines werealongside the North Quay, Darse PThe Adriatic :Bombing attacks on Durazzo.The naval Baid on 12. With reference to War Cabinet 409, Minute 5, as regardsOstend. the &quot; Vindictive,&quot; the First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet thatthe Germans had opened the sluice-gates, thus setting free a large body of water, and in consequence the position of the &quot; Vindictive &quot;had&apos; somewhat shifted. As far as was known, no submarines had,since the &quot; Vindictive &quot; was sunk, used Ostend.the matter while the German offensive was proceeding, and similarrepresentations had been made by the Lord Chancellor. Lord Curzonagreed that it was rather academic to discuss the matter at present,but thought that it was not improbable that a question would beput in connection with the Report of the Foreign Office Committee.No public reference had 3^et been made to the existence of theCommittee. He was in favour of delaying discussion of the subject,especially as it might come before the Imperial War Cabinet.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) Subject to the approval of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and the Secretary of State for theColonies, copies of the Report should be sent confidenti-ally to President Wilson and the Dominion Premiers, it being made clear that the Report did not set forth thepolicy of the Government but was the result of the deliberations of an expert Committee.(b.) The subject of the League of Nations should be considered at the forthcoming Session of the Imperial War Cabinet.
American 13. With reference to War Cabinet 410, Minute 14, the PrimeReinforcements. Minister stated that, as a result of his visit to the War Office that morning, he had learned that there was no doubt that american troops were coming over in considerable numbers at the presenttime, and that 40,000 were now in France and 20,000 to 30,000 onthe high seas. As regards these numbers it would be necessary,however, to consult Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig as to when theywould be ready to be placed in the firing line. General Hutchinson,who 3iad just returned from the United States, had expressed himself confident that the supply would be kept up until next. July, when there might be a slackening as regards the number ofmen to he transported. As regards the personnel, GeneralHutchinson had formed the opinion that, although the youngerofficers were not at present very good, the men were excellent.He was further of opinion that there was a want of higherorganisation in the United States as regards military matters.The Prime Minister drew attention to the delay that was takingplace as regards the supply of artillery, and instanced the case ofthe time that had been wasted owing to the Americans being determined to adopt guns of their own instead of availing themselves of either French or British guns. He added that the original ideaof the Americans with regard to the creation of their army was onlyto call up 50,000 men a month. They had since increased that number to 250,000, and were aware of the fact that they could still further increase it to 450,000 ; hut the organisation of their resources was such that they were not in a position to clothe and give rifles to the larger number and, consequently, were notprepared to encourage public criticism by making a greater effort.The Prime Minister was of opinion that it was highly desirable thatwe should get together criticisms of their methods, in so far as theycould be improved upon in furthering the prosecution of the war, sothat the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs could send the sameto Colonel House for such action as he thought best.This led to the expression of the opinion that Colonel house would be of far greater assistance here to the Allied cause than he would be in America, it being pointed out that Lord Readinghad acquired so much influence in the States that the presence ofColonel House could be far better spared from that country now than in the past.It was pointed out that it was highly desirable that, if possible,Colonel House should be present at the next meeting of the supreme war Council, which would be held during the first week in June.The War Cabinet requested Idle Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to go into the question of American representation in Europe, and to take such action as regards colonel house as they might think desirable.Co-ordination of 14. The War Cabinet approved the following arrangements forBritish Missions in    co-ordinating all British Missions in France :-France.(a.) All British Missions in France are to be notified by therespective Government Departments in England underwhich they serve that Lord Derby will act as Head of all british Missions in the same way as Lord Reading doesin Washington.(6.) Lord Derby will have no executive authority in regard tosuch Missions, but is to be kept fully informed of any matters which require adjustment with the FrenchGovernment.(c.) All communications are to pass, as heretofore, direct betweenthe Missions and the Departments at home with Avhichthey are connected.
Food Production i$  With reference to memoranda bv the President of them1919- Board  of Agriculture and Fisheries (Paper G.T.-4409), and amemorandum by the Food Controller (Paper G.T.-4499), relative tothe possibilities of food production in 1919, the War Cabinetdirected -The Secretary to place this matter on the Agenda for Wednesday,the 22nd May, for their consideration.Austria : 10. With reference to War Cabinet 411, Minute 25, a discussionEmperor Karfs arose with regard to the debate which was to take place in the-Letfcer- House of Commons on the following clay, on the adjournment, uponthe questions which were to be raised on the subject of the EmperorKarhs letter.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he would reply to the debate, but that he could only deal with the question on broad lines.The Prime Minister said that he was quite willing to take partin the debate, if it were necessary, but that he could only say that information was given to him in the strictest secrecy, that he had accepted these conditions, and that it would be impossible for him todivulge the information until he had been absolved from hispromise of secrecy.The War Cabinet decided that The Secrelary of State for Foreign Affairs should reply to the debate.The Prime Minister agreed to be in the House of Commons soas to be available to take part, if necessary.(d.) In the event of any member of a Mission requiring to seeone of the principal members of the French Government,i.e.. any Minister superior to an Uncler-Secretary, onany matter other than that relating to purely depart-mental routine, he is to notify to Lord Derby his intention of doing so, the object for which the interviewis sought, and the result of the interview. In caseswhere the intervention of one of the principal membersof the French Government is concerned, the Head of theMission should consult with Lord Derby as to whetherit is desirable that he should attend the. interview onbehalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government.(e.) In the event of visits by French Ministers to London, theDepartment concerned should notify Lord Derby, throughthe Foreign Office, giving the name of the Minister andthe object of his visit. The reason for this is that inmanjr eases several Departments may be concerned, andit would be possible for Lord Derby to assemble the heads of the respective Missions together, and to draw up a joint memorandum of information on the subject which would be useful to the British Ministers concernedwhen seeing the French Ministers.(/.) Lord Derby has arranged to hold a weekly meeting of the heads of the principal British Missions now in Paris.Although the British Military Representative and his staff at Versailles do not come under this scheme,General Sackville-West is authorised either to be present or to send a representative to the weekly meetings.
Ireland: 17. With reference to War Cabinet 408 a, Minute 1, attentionStatus of Chief was drawn to a question which was to be asked in the House of secretary. Commons that afternoon by Mr. Herbert Samuel as to whether anychange was contemplated in the status of the Chief Secretary and theLord-Lieutenant of Ireland, or in his functions in the Governmentof Ireland.A general discussion ensued, in which it was pointed out that lord French and Mr. Shortt were occupying similar positions tothose occupied by Lord Spencer and Mr. Trevelyan, who, while holding respectively the positions of Viceroy and Chief Secretary,both had seats in the Cabinet,The War Cabinet decided that The Chancellor of the Exchequer should reply to Mr. HerbertSamuel to the effect that there was no change in the status of the Chief Secretary, but that the condition of affairs inIreland entailed additional responsibilities on the Viceroy.Ireland. 18. With  reference   to   War Cabinet 408a, Minute  1, theSecretary of State for the Colonies informed the War Cabinet thathe had been in telephonic communication with Field-Marshal lord french, who was anxious to know if the War Cabinet would approve of the Proclamation referred to in War Cabinet 408a, Minute 2,being issued as it was originally drafted. This proposal wotildrescind the decision of the War Cabinet that the Proclamationshould be issued in two parts, the first dealing with crime and thesecond with voluntary recruiting;. Mr. Long said that he had askedLord French if he had considered the desirability of a simultaneouspublication of the two Proclamations, and Lord French had informed him that the legal advisers of the Irish Government were stronglyaverse to such a course. Lord French had been unable over the telephone to give reasons for this advice, but had said that he attached great importance to it, that the Irish Government consideredthe situation very dangerous, and that he must ask the War Cabinetto support, the Irish Government. Mr. Long pointed out that the lateIrish Government held the opinion that the War Cabinet had not sufficiently supported them in their efforts to preserve order inIreland, and that even the Attorney-General for Ireland had latelytold him that he had always done his best, but that he had invariablybeen impeded from England.Mr. Long had pointed out that this was quite incorrect. Hereminded the War Cabinet of their promises and asked them togive the new Government of Ireland their support and to trust them.The Prime Minister confirmed Mr. Long&apos;s view that the state-ment as to the non-support of the late Irish Government was whollyincorrect, and that to his knowledge the Cabinet had never overruledany proposals to this end made by the late Chief Secretary.Lord Curzon expressed an opinion in favour of the Proclamationbeing issued as originally drafted. Not only did he consider itdesirable that this should be done in order to support the Lord-Lieutenant as Head of the Irish Government, but also from his knowledge of the facts of the situation which had been laid before-  the War Cabinet.A discussion ensued as to the policy of-the Government withregard to the enforcement of the Military Service Act on Ireland andthe proposals for Home Ride. It was pointed out that if theGovernment decided to appeal to the Irish to provide sufficientrecruits by voluntary methods, it would be undesirable to proceed atpresent with the introduction into the Plouse of Commons of a home rule Bill.In this connection Mr. Long said that he had had a long talk with General Sir Bryan Mahon, who was a strict Roman Catholic,and that General Mahon had informed him that he was certain there
would be a considerable flow of Irishmen to the Colours from SouthIreland if the War Office were prepared to keep Irishmen inIrish units. Mr. Long said that Sir B. Mahon had informed him that the War Office were not prepared to do this, but that he(Mr. Long) hoped that he would be able, in conjunction&apos; withthe Adjutant-General, to work out a plan for the enlistment of menin Ireland which would be satisfactory to them. Mr. Long also saidthat many Irishmen had told him that, if a large number of volunteers were obtained from Ireland, the relatives of those whohad gone would be advocates of conscription.Mr. Chamberlain said that there was strong reason to appeal for voluntary recruits at the present time, as the Government hadprecluded itself by its pledges from putting conscription into force for the present, and that therefore the present time should be usedto the best advantage. He did not agree that the time used in thisway meant the abandonment of the Governments policy.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for the Colonies should inform the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland that the War Cabinet had rescindedthe decision arrived at in War Cabinet 408 A, Minute 2,and that approval was given for the issue of the originalProclamation dealing with the present situation in ireland as read in draft by Mr. Long on the previous occasion when this question was discussed.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 15, 1918.
