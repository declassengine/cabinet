The Western Front: 1. The Director of Military Operations reported that theGerman Attack. Germans had attacked south of. Armentieres yesterday with 9divisions. Three more of their divisions had actually been identified north of Armentieres, and probably there were 5. Ofthe 12 divisions actually identified, 11 were fresh, and it mightbe assumed that all the reserves the enemy had on that front atthe beginning of the battle had now been absorbed.South of the Oise, on the French front, 3 more german divisions had been identified, making a total of 104 divisionsactually known to have taken part in the battle, although thefigure was probably higher.Yesterday the enemy had attacked to the north of Messines,near Wytschaete, but they had been replused and checked. Theyhad succeeded in getting into Messines, but had been unable toget out of it, and fighting was continuing to the western end ofthe village. The Germans had failed to take Hill 63, and theyhad made no material progress west of Ploegsteert. Last nightwe had withdrawn from Armentieres. This place has been delugedwith gas, first by the enemy, and now by us, until it is probablyuninhabitable. South of Armentieres, the Germans had takenSteenwerck, but it was hoped that we should retake it. Fisbtingwas in progress at Estaires. South of Estaires the enemy had crossed the Lawe and entered Lestrem, on the way to Bethune.The enemy had developed a distinct flank, probably preliminary to an attack further south, towards Bethune. The enemy hasgood railway centres at Lille and Douai, and it was reasonable to suppose that he might abandon the southern attack on Arras inorder to press us in the north.2. With reference to War Cabinet 388, minute 5, theSecretarv of State for War reported the following casualtiesfrom the 21st March to the 7th April, 1918, excluding sick:-Officers. Other ranks.Killed       ...         ...      1,086 10,111Wounded......      3,934 50,988Missing     .......     2,632 54,7697,652 115,868Palestine. 3. The Director of Military Operations reported that theTurks, with German assistance, had attacked our troops on the left centre of our line, north-west of Jerusalem. The front onwhich they had attacked was not wide, and their gain in ground, &apos; was not material It was expected that we should counter-attack.In all probability the object of the Turks was either a recon-naissance to discover whether we were moving our troops away, or else an attempt to prevent us from moving them.With regard to the German forces in that theatre, there were three German detachments called Pasha Divisions.H.M.S. &quot; Magic.&quot;4. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that H.M.S. &quot; Magic &quot;had been mined or torpedoed at the entrance of Lough Swilly at11.12 a.m. on the 10th April. She was reported to have reachedharbour with her bows blown off, and 23 missing.german submarines offMonrovia.5. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that a German sub-marine had appeared off Monrovia, and had compelled theGovernment to close down the wireless station and cable stationunder the threat of bombardment.   Both stations are French.
Telegram to portugal.Tobacco Stocks.7. With reference to War Cabinet 387, Minute 6, the WarCabinet took note of Lord Curzon&apos;s decision (Paper G.T.-4198)that the importation of tobacco, on the present level of 6,000 tonsa month, should be maintained.. Transport Workers&apos; 8. With reference to War Cabinet 352, Minute 9, the WarBattalions. Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministry  of sShipping, on the imperative necessity for increasing the strengthof the Transport Workers&apos; Battalions (Paper G.T.-4188). Inthis memorandum it was pointed out that, although the WarCabinet had decided on the 22nd February when the number ofmen in the battalions was 10,260 to increase the strength of theTransport Workers&apos; Battalions by 5,000 men, on the 5th April six weeks after the date of the decision the total strength of the battalions had diminished to 10,145. At the present moment therewas an unsatisfied demand for 1,000 men for Liverpool, 1,300 men for Manchester, and 100 men for Millwall Docks.Sir Joseph Maclay said that it had been decided that thefullest possible use was to be made of North-American liners fortrooping purposes. In order to carry out this policy, the slowerships had been taken out of Liverpool, and the port had been cleared as far as possible for the big rush of American troops whowere expected to arrive at the end of this month. Unless theTransport Workers&apos; Battalions were increased it would not bepossible to handle the arriving ships without delay. It was hoped with additional labour to hurry up despatch and effect a saving of five days per voyage, owing to quicker turn-round, and this saving in tonnage would be equal to about 25,000extra American troops per month.Sir Auckland Geddes said that, while he was in agreementwith the policy of increasing the Transport Workers&apos; Battalions,he thought it would be a. waste of good material to use the recruits,who were now coming in at the rate of about 3,300 to 3,400 per day, for work on the docks These recruits were mostly &quot;A&quot; mendrawn from the miners and munition workers, and were wantedfor the fighting units. He suggested, how ever, that men from theAgricultural Companies who were engaged upon work other thanagriculture, shordd be taken for the Transport Workers&apos;Battalions.The War Cabinet were impressed with the importance of getting these men for the docks in order to speed up the workand thereby increase the: flow of American troops, and they there-fore decided that The Secretary of State for War, the Minister of NationalService, and the Minister of Shipping, should confer witha view to increasing the strength of the TransportWorkers&apos; Battalions, and if they failed to come to a satis-factory conclusion the matter should be referred to Mr.Barnes. .6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs asked whetherthe War Cabinet considered it desirable to send a complimentarytelegram to the Portuguese Government, congratulating them uponthe valour of their troops during the recent fighting.The War Cabinet were of opinion that it would be well to await the arrival of Sir Henry Wilson, who was returning from france the same afternoon, and if he confirmed the reports as tothe good fighting qualities which the Portuguese were said to haveshown The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should send a. con-gratulatory telegram to the Portuguese Government.
Ireland : 9. With reference to War Cabinet 388, Minute 6, Mr. BarnesCompulsory ^ informed the War Cabinet that he had serious apprehensions with military Service. regard to the situation of affairs with relation to the proposal toapply the Military Service Act to Ireland. He had always under-stood that the policy of the War Cabinet was, firstly, to stand orfall by the two Bills, namely, the Military Service Bill and the- proposed Home Rule Bill; and, secondly, that military service wasonly to be applied to Ireland after an interval during which ameasure of Home Rule could be passed. On that understandinghe had agreed to the course to be pursued by the Government, andlie was very disappointed with the speech delivered by the HomeSecretary in the House of Commons yesterday, a speech in favourof compulsory military service, pure and simple, and one which left out any mention of the subject of Home Rule. Mr. Barnesmaintained that not only was this, in his opinion, not carryingout the intention of the War Cabinet, but that, in the absence ofsome definite steps being taken with regard to the question ofHome Rule, it would be necessary for him to reconsider hisposition. Mr. Barnes suggested that it might be possible, in viewof the present situation, for something to be done to obtain some agreement between the parties concerned, and that it was most &apos;essential that the representatives of Irish. opinion should beinformed that their present antagonistic attitude with regard to conscription was likely to prove most injurious to the prospects of the passage of any Home Rule Bill.The Prime Minister suggested that too much importanceshould not be attached to the fact that, while the Military service bill was being debated in the House of Commons, there were fewreferences to any proposed Home Rule Bill. Such references. would naturally be out of order. In introducing the MilitaryService Bill the Prime Minister stated that he had made clear theposition of the Government on this question, and that, while itwas out of order for Ministers to repeat these statements duringthe passage of the Bill, yet he fully agreed that, if the Governmentwere challenged on the subject by the Irish Party, it would benecessary for those challenges to be replied to. Mr.Lloyd George further informed the War Cabinet that he had that morning been in consultation with the Unionist Ministers ofthe Government, who were fully agreed that, in view of Labour,Liberal, and American opinion, a very serious position would arise if the attention of the Government were- centred only on the oneBill.Mr. Barnes regretted that he had not had an opportunity oflistening to the Prime Minister&apos;s speech in the House of Commons,and stated that, in his opinion, it was vital that, before the applica-tion of the Military Service Act to Ireland, the Home Rxile Billshould have been put before the Plouse of Commons. In hisopinion there were two great dangers ahead: one, the danger of grave opposition, and the other, the danger that, if any attemptwere made to enforce compulsory military service in Ireland inview of the strong feeling evinced by the Nationalists on thissubject, the temper of the House of Commons would make thepassage of any Home Rule Bill impossible. Mr. Barnes further pointed out that Lord Curzon had agreed that the Government was bound to both Bills, to which Lord Curzon agreed, with a proviso that it would be impossible to pass the Home Rule Bill in the face of the united opposition of all sections of the Irish Party.Mr. Barnes stated that his colleagues agreed to that proviso, *but that he himself could not forget the evidence which had beengiven before the War Cabinet, by responsible men, to the effectthat conscription without Home Rule wTas out of the question.It was generally agreed that the Home Rule Bill should beprepared immediately, in order that, if possible, such a Bill shouldbe laid before the House of Commons before the Military Service
Emigration and 10. The War Cabinet had before them the draft of a Bill toEmigrants&apos; improve the existing organisation for affording information andPassages Bill. advice to those who wish to emigrate from the British Isles, and toprovide for the establishment and powers of a Central EmigrationAuthority, and for the supervision and control of passage-brokersand passage-brokers&apos; agents and Emigration Societies (PaperU.T.-4061 a), together with a covering memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (Paper G.T.-4061).The War Cabinet decided To ask the Minister of Reconstruction for his observations onthe Bill.Recall of Civil 11. The War Cabinet had under consideration memorandaServants from the dealing with the desirability of recalling civil servants from theColours. colours, by the Minister of Reconstruction (Papers G.T.-2680 and3872), and by the Food Controller (Paper G.T.-3937).Dr. Addison said that he was finding it exceedingly difficultto obtain the services of highly expert men capable of takingcharge of very important administrative work. His proposal wasthat a small number of civil servants, of approved qualifications and experience, now serving with the colours, should be recalledto civil life. The number he had in mind was not more than 20or 30 men, none of whom should be in Grade 1, Class &quot;A,&quot; orunder 30 years of age. He believed that one such good man would set free a number of juniors. There was at present considerablewastage and overlapping, which could be eliminated by theappointment of a quite small number of the ablest type of civilservants.Mr. Clynes supported the representations of Dr. Addison,and urged the pressing needs of the Ministry of Food. that ministry now employed about 4,000 persons, mainly on clericalduties. Of this number about 560 held responsible posts, and only some 66 of these were civil servants. He further emphasised theimportance of retaining an adequate number of men to ensure thesmooth working of the rationing system. The great food dis-tributing houses had been denuded of their most capable men, and,as a result, were unable to do their work efficiently.Mr. Win tour said that the Ministry of Food already employedlarge numbers of business men, but, in order to secure smooth work-ing with other Departments and the most efficient use of the busi-ness men, a nucleus of civil servants was indispensable.Sir Auckland Geddes said that there were at present 4,321men under 31 y7ears of age in the Civil Service, and there was cer-tain to be considerable public criticism on account of the retentionof these men. In his own Department, which employed some20,000 persons, there were only 6 civil servants.Lord Derby believed that men of the highly expert type which Dr..   Addison   wished to recall were almost certainly holdingresponsible posts in the army, and could, therefore, not be spared,especially7 at this juncture.[1365-389 J CBill had passed its Third Reading. The opinion was also gener-ally expressed that, while it would be of little use for the WarCabinet to approach the Nationalist Party with a view to the voluntary enlistment of sufficient men to meet the critical situation, yet representations by the Labour party  to the leaders ofthe Nationalist Party, who might be invited to forward proposalsfor the consideration of the War Cabinet, might be most valuable.The War Cabinet decided that The Prime Minister should be asked to appoint a Committeeto draw up, as soon as possible, the details of a home rule Bill to be presented to the House of Commons.
Lord Curzon suggested that there were three classes of civdservants upon which Departments could draw. There were retiredcivil servants from the home service, many of whom had greatadministrative experience; there were the retired civil servantsfrom India; and, lastly, the younger civil servants from India whoare on leave in this country. The last were young men of capacity and of energy. He recommended that the Departments should put themselves in touch with the India Office, in order to secure theservices of such men.The War Cabinet commended Lord Curzon&apos;s suggestion tothe consideration of the Ministry of Food and other government Departments.Tribunals for 12. The War Cabinet had before them a copy of a MinuteGovernment from Lord Robert Cecil to Mr. Balfour, on the position of men of offices r, ilitaxy age in Government offices (Paper G.T.-4038).Lord Robert Cecil said that there was a small number of menof military age in the Foreign Office who wished to join the army,but who were not allowed to do so by the Department. It was extremely difficult for the Head of a Department to decide whowas and who was not indispensable, and he therefore recommended the setting up of a Department Tribunal. This tribunal might be composed of some person like the Chief Clerk of the Office con-cerned, a representative of the Ministry of National Service, andan independent chairman.Sir Auckland Geddes explained that there was already inexistence machinery similar to that suggested, by Lord robert cecil. It had been set up by the Ministry of National Service,and it had already dealt with the Ministry of Food, the Ministryof Munitions, and some ether Departments. It had not dealt withmen in khaki, but only with civilians.The attention of the War Cabinet was called to the numberof men of military age, in khaki, attached to some of the Govern-ment Departments at home, in the United States, and in Canada,and to the desirability of an investigation being made with a viewto using as many as possible of such men in France.Sir -Joseph Maclay said that he was sure tha.t good effectswould result if men in khaki, employed in Offices, were made towear civilian clothes.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Minister of National Service should extend hisDepartmental Tribunal machinery to all GovernmentDepartments, with any necessary adjustments.(&amp;.) The War Office, the Admiralty, and the Air Force shouldmake a return to the War Cabinet of men in uniformengaged in non-combatant services at home and onforeign missions, who were physically sound.Passports for 13. The War Cabinet had before them a Minute by LordIndian Home Rule Islington (Paper G.T.-4190) on the subject of passports forDelegates. Indian Home Rule Delegates.The case was briefly stated by the Acting-Secretary of Statefor India. The Government of India bad granted passports to tendelegates in all. Five had started in March, and were now in theMediterranean. The remaining five, including Mr. Tilak, were held up at Colombo, pending further directions from the Home Govern-ment. The passports had been originally granted by the Govern-ment of India when the India Office were in consultation with theHome Office and War Office, and therefore had no time to send
instructions to the Government of India before the delegatesleft. On the 2nd April, however, the India Office had beeninformed that the War Cabinet had endorsed a memo-randum by the General Staff recommending that &quot; neitherTilak&apos;s party nor any similar party should be allowedto leave India, and that those who had already left should,if possible, be stopped and sent back.&quot; This decision created an embarrassing situation for the Government of India.It was pointed out that the decision referred to was not aWar Cabinet decision, but a decision on a point of urgency arrivedat, on behalf of the War Cabinet, by the Prime Minister and theChancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation with the Chief of theImperial General Staff, on the 2nd April, when there had been noCabinet Meeting until the evening.Various alternative solutions of the dileinna were discussed.Attention was drawn to the dual purpose of Mr. Tilak&apos;s journey.He had received a passport to proceed to England as a delegateof the Home Rule party. He was also engaged in a libel actionagainst Sir Valentine Chirol. This action was said to be ready for trial. Were he prevented from coming to England, he would represent his stoppage as a political manoeuvre of his opponent inthe lawsuit.It was agreed that, whatever decision the Cabinet took,trouble was bound to ensue.   The question for determination was whether it was better to risk trouble in India or trouble at home.In this respect it was argued that Mr. Tilak could not cause moretrouble in India than he had already caused; his presence inEngland, a fortiori in Ireland, would be mischievous in intentionas well as in result. As a British subject, he could not be deportedor interned ; and, as other natives of India were allowed to attend meetings and address them, it would not be easy to deny himsimilar freedom. There remained no other remedy7 than prosecu-tion, should he. as seemed most probable, deliberately court it.Further, it was pointed out that the Secretary of State for india had been for some months receiving deputations all over the peninsula, and hearing the views of every section of opinion in thecountry. There was. therefore, no political justification for the visit to England at this time of deputies from an extremistminority.It was decided that The India Office should inform the Government of India thatMr. Tilak and his companions were not to proceed ontheir journey.As to the five delegates already en route, the Cabinet were informed that orders had been sent to Gibraltar and Malta to stopthem.  The Cabinet approved of this action, and decided that The return of these delegates to India should be arranged.14. With reference to War Cabinet 383, Minute 7, the WarCabinet had before them a report by Lord Crawford&apos;s Committee(Paper G.^\-202) on the proposed Imperial War Museum.Lord Crawford stated that the matter required careful and prolonged examination, and expressed the view that the presentmoment was, perhaps, not an opportune one. The First Com-missioner of Works agreed with this view.The War Cabinet adopted Lord Crawford&apos;s suggestion to postpone consideration of the subject, and meanwhileauthorised Sir Alfred Mond to continue collectingmaterial.
15. Sir Alfred Mond drew attention ,to a statement in thepress, incorrect in ail details, to the effect that the Museum was to cost l,000,000z&apos;., to be raised by public subscription, and that itwould be situated in Hyde Park. He had been pressed to contra-diet this, and had, when approached by press representatives, saidthat the account referred to was incorrect, and that the schemewas being dealt with by a committee which would in due coursereport to the Cabinet.It was pointed out that it was still alleged in the press that theGovernment had authorised the expenditure in principle, and thatthis was incorrect, and, if repeated, ought to be denied.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,April 11, 1918.o
