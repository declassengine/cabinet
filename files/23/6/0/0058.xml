The Western 1. THE Director of Military Intelligence  reported that norront- operations of importance had taken place on the Western front.The number of fresh divisions in Prince Rupprecht&apos;s army was now30. General Headquarters reported that they had little material withwhich to make any forecasts as to where the next German offensivewould take place, but they inclined to the belief that an offensivefrom the Lys salient appeared to be most likely. The Director ofMilitary Intelligence added that a telegram had been received fromGeneral Foch&apos;s Headquarters to the effect that they had received information that the next German attack might take xolace betweenBethune and Ypres, and that there were no signs of a German attackeast of Rheims. General Foch&apos;s Headquarters had also received areport from Copenhagen saying that an attack might be expectedbetween the Somme and the Scarpe. On the whole, the balanceof evidence pointed to an attack on Prince Rupprecht&apos;s army front.German Divisions. 2. In reply to a cpiestion regarding a report that the germans had broken up three or four of their divisions, the Director ofMilitary Intelligence said that he did not attach much importance tothis statement, as the Germans constantly formed divisions forcertain purposes, and then broke them up again. It was true thatthe 226th division had been broken up and the units distributed among other divisions, and that the 302nd division on the Balkanfront was now composed of Bulgars, only the Divisional Staffremaining German. The German units of this 302nd division hadbeen sent to the Western front. The Director of Military Intelligenceadded that the 9th assault battalion had also been broken up. he agreed, however, that the total number of German divisions on allfronts was now reduced to 239.The Italian Front. 3- p]ie Director of Military Intelligence reported that operations on the Italian front had died down, with the exception of a little progress the Italians had made towards the mouth of the Piave.AustrianCasualties.4. The Director of Military Intelligence said that there was some difference of opinion regarding the estimate of casualtiessuffered by the Austrians during the recent battle. The ItalianCommand estimated the number at between 180,000 and 200,000.General Delme-Radcliffe estimated the number at 150,000, whereasGeneral Wilson put the figure at 100,000.Command of Italian 5. The Director of Military Intelligence   reported  that   the8th Army. Command of the with Italian army had been assumed by GeneralE.   calviglia,   late    commanding  the  Xth  Corps,  vice  GeneralPennella.Austrian Moral.6. In reply to a question as to whether there was any truth inthe report that the Hungarian soldiers were refusing to fight, theDirector of Military Intelligence stated that he had received no evidence to this effect. He said, however, that the Poles were fighting well for the Austrians, and that the Polish prisoners had no knowledge of Allied propaganda or thefavour of the Polish Nation.recent developments inSinking of vessels in the Black Sea.7. The Director of Military Intelligence stated that he hadreceived a report to the effect that some Russian vessels and sixtorpedo-boat destroyers had been sunk by the Russians atNovorossisk.
american divisions.Mesopotamia.East Africa.Bombing Attacks.8. The Director of Military Intelligence stated, in reply to aquestion, that of the second five American divisions with the british army, three were ready to go into the line for defensive purposes,and that the other two were not yet ready. The total Americanforce in France at the present moment, including all arms, was920,000.9. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that on the21st June, 1918, after some small fighting on the road with Jangalis,a portion of General Dunsterville&apos;s mobile columns had arrived atBesht. According to a telegram received from General Redl, Dutoffwas clearing out the Bolsheviks between Taskhend and Orenburg.The telegram also stated that the Bolshevik movement was collapsingin Turkestan.10. The Director of Military Intelligence informed the WarCabinet that, by the latest information, Von Lettow was advancingon Quilmane, at which place there were a small Portuguese cruiser and a British gunboat. To reinforce these in case of attack, 800troops were being sent by sea, 150 of the K.A.R. had already arrivedor were due to arrive, and a total of 800 should be there by the1st July.11. The First Sea Lord reported that the usual bombing ofZeebrugge and Bruges had taken place.Submarines.12. The First Sea Lord reported that the Italian Command atTaranto claimed to have sunk a German submarine. An unconfirmedreport, had been received from Portland to the effect that an armedtrawler had sunk a submarine.Prisoners of War.13. With reference to War Cabinet 427, Minute 5, the WarCabinet had before them a memorandum by the Prisoners of war department (Paper G.T.-4943) which stated that, in a telegramfrom The Hague (No. 2282, dated the 22nd June, 1918), the british delegates had raised two points regarding the negotiations whichwere now proceeding, on which the War cabinet&apos;s decision was desired. The first point was that Germany had offered to repatriatesome of the British combatants now in Holland as a counter-weight to the large surplus of German civilians interned in England ascompared with the number of British civilians interned in Germany.Mr. Vansittart, representing the Prisoners of War Department,said that the British delegates considered this exchange inadequate,and were insisting on the repatriation, in addition, of some Britishcombatants now interned in Germany. Air. Vansittart pointed outthat, if an agreement regarding the repatriation of men who hadbeen in captivity for 18 months and more was concluded, therewould anyhow only remain in Holland some 450 sick combatantprisoners. It would be absurd to consider this small number as a counter-weight to the large surplus of German civilians interned inEngland. Mr. Vansittart was of opinion that the suggestion madeby the delegates should be adhered to, and indeed that there shouldbe a man-far-man exchange, or as nearly as possible, on the grounds that if repatriated combatants were not to be employed at the frontor on lines of communication, repatriated German civilians, ofwhom the great majority would be of military age, would be asuseful in the interior as ex-combatants.The Adjutant-General agreed with this view.Mr. Chamberlain said that the delegates&apos; proposal proceeded onthe hypothesis that combatant prisoners could not again be used forcombatant service.   If this was the case, a civilian was as good as a
soldier, and there could be little objection to the delegates taking this line.It was suggested that those Members of the House of Commonswho were interested in getting our prisoners back to this country might object to an attempt to drive a bargain which might prove an obstacle to an agreement, and to the assumption that a trained soldierwas on a par with a civilian. It was pointed out, however, that noone could possibly object to a man-for-man exchange, and that, if germany intended to adhere to the agreement not to employrepatriated prisoners in the battle line, there was really no difference,from the point of view of exchange, between a soldier and a civilian.At this point Lord Stanhope informed the War Cabinet that sir George Cave was returning to England at an early date.The War Cabinet decided (a.) That, as the bargain was based on the hypothesis that soldiers are not to be used in occupied territories, andthe persons released are not to he used for military purposes, either on the line of communications or else-where, the British delegates should press for the basisof a man-for-man exchange, combatants and civiliansbeing treated on the same footing ;(6.) To support the delegates with regard to the second point raised by them, that they were insisting that repatriatedprisoners should not be employed in foreign territory,such as Russia or the East ;(c.) That the Prisoners of War Department should transmit theabove instructions to The Hague, adding at the sametime that they were issued subject to any modificationsthe War Cabinet might add after consulting Sir GeorgeCave.Man-Power :Calling up Tube-makers.Release of Agri-cultural labour for MilitaryService.14. With reference to War Cabinet 43.1, Minute 5, and WarCabinet 409, Minute 7, the War Cabinet had under consideration amemorandum by the Admiralty (Paper G.T.-4894) and a memo-rand um by the President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries(Paper G.T.-4922).Sir R Horne said, with reference to the calling up of tube-makers, that the Admiralty regretted the necessity of bringing thismatter again before the War Cabinet, but that the consequences of calling up all men of Grade I born in the years 1898-1899 had created a situation in regard to the production of necessary boilertubes for naval craft which was extremely serious. This decision onlyinvolved about 715 men altogether. For months past the admiralty had been face to face with the fact that the supply of tubes was notmeeting the demand. The available margin in existence at the end1916 had been reduced at the present time by a half, viz., 260,000to 120,000 tubes, which was only equal to four weeks&apos; supply.Frequent applications for labour had been made to the Ministry ofNational Service to reinforce the labour available, but it had beenfound that the class of labour required for such vigorous work wasvery difficult to obtain. Out of 148 men who had been sent to twofirms, only twenty-eight had been able to stand up to the physicalstrain. Sir R. Horne said that the position was that, if these men were taken, the manufacturers would lose 30 per cent, of their output,or a total loss of 10,000 tubes per week, which represented a larger number than would be required for a destroyer. There were only four manufacturers making boiler tubes for the Navy, and about150 men might be taken under this proposal from these manu-factories ; but he presumed that any exemption granted to thesefirms must be granted also to other tube manufacturers. The effecton the manufacture of tubes for aeroplanes was almost equallyserious, as the demand for these tubes was increasing very rapidly.If these men could not be retained, the only alternative was to bring
back stokers from the Navy to do the work, but these the Navycould not spare.The First Sea Lord, in dealing with the executive result on theNavy, said that the loss of these men would mean the loss of onedestroyer a week, either in the new programme or in the refittingprogramme, for thirteen weeks. It would take another month to regain that position, and meant that the programme was put back for four months, which was really a very serious matter in view ofthe fact that destroyers were the armament of which the Navy was most in need.The Prime Minister indicated that it might be expedient for the sake of recruiting to let the men be called up, but thereafter to applyit to get them back to their industry.The Minister of Munitions pleaded for equal treatment for all departments, and said that it would be very invidious if anydistinc-tion were made. Mr. Churchill instanced the serious difficultieswhich were occmrring, owing to the clean cut, in various Depart-ments under the control of his Ministry. A resolution had beenreceived from the Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon, and FinanceCompany (Limited), which was the firm most responsible forturning out tanks, in which a protest was recorded against theyoung men being taken before suitable men had been provided totake their places. In this firm there were from 200 to 300 meninvolved, and the effect of taking these men woidd be thatthe output of tanks would be reduced from 50 to 15 a week.Mr. Churchill qxioted from reports which he had received fromother industries, including the chemical industry employed inmaking poison gas, the manufacture of breech mechanism for guns,and the steel department, where the effect of calling up 558 men ofthe ages of 19 and 20 from the ore mines in Cumberland wouldinvolve the loss of 2,000 to 2,500 tons of ore. Mr. Churchill saidthat if the War- Cabinet ruled that the decision should stand, butthat exceptions would be allowed in cases which were serious and where numbers were small, it would be most unfair to apply thoseexceptions to one Department only, and that the only terms onwhich Iris Department had agreed to the decision were that thereshould be universality in the contract. He made a suggestion thatthe Admiralty and Ministry of Munitions should be allowed a discretion each to retain 1,000 men.The Minister of National Service expressed the opinion that ifthe War Cabinet did not find itself able to stand by its policy ofthe clean cut for young men, then recruiting, so far as tribunalswere concerned, would come to an end. Sir Auckland Geddespointed out that he had received reports from the West countryshowing that there was very grave dissatisfaction with regard tothe young men employed in the dockyards there, and that it wouldbe impossible to keep recruiting going, in view of the new ageperiod, if the young men were left. All the men of the agesbetween 19 and 20 were not being taken, but only Grade I men,and he would regard any departure from the policy laid down as avery serious matter.The Minister of Labour said that he recognised the force ofSir Auckland Geddes&apos; statement, and that if exceptions were madein any one case there would be very serious results on recruiting.Making exceptions in any case adversely affected the feeling oflabour, as it wras impossible to explain why exceptions were made,but Mr. Roberts said that he was not in a position to express an opinion on the strength of the case put forward by the Admiralty orthe Ministry of Munitions.The Prime Minister said it was obvious that these demands forany revision of the decisions given by the War Cabinet must betreated as a whole, and requested the President of the Board ofAgriculture and Fisheries to put forward his proposals with regardto agricultural labour.Mr. Prothero said that his Department had been asked to find[1365-436] C
30,000 men, and had made every effort to do so. The result,however, showed that agriculture would be reduced to such adepleted state of labour that the harvesting of the crops of 1918would be in danger, and that it could not be hoped to produceanything like the amount of food in 1919 which would be producedthis year Mr. Prothero pointed out that the farmers were veryembittered and out of hand, mainly owing to the fact that they hadbeen urged, in the national interest, to go to great expense andundertake arable farming, in which the chances of profit were lessthan that of grass farming, and yet the men absolutely essential tothe harvesting of their crops were being taken away. Consequently,they were expressing the opinion that, after all their efforts,agriculture, as compared with the military exigencies, was of no account, and the farmers, becoming utterly dispirited, would not make any effort to grow food next year. Mr. Prothero said that the counties had endeavoured to the very best of their ability tocomplete the quota schedrded for, hut although, in very many cases,absolutely essential men had been taken, the total of men availablebetween the ages of 19 and 23 was only 15,588, and he asked thatthe War Cabinet should give a decision that the recruitment of menfrom agriculture should stop at that number.Sir Arthur Lee said that, owing to the leakage of agricultural labourers to other Government Departments, there were less men available for recruitment from agriculture than had been anticipated,and of those that remained a very much smaller proportion were fit men than was expected. Of those fit men, very many wrere key men,but the War Agricultural Committees had found it necessary, in orderto attempt to complete the quotas required, to take away the onlymen on small holdings. Sir Arthur Lee said that he could notexaggerate the dangers as regards the existing crop, and expressedthe opinion that every possible effort had been made by theAgricultural Committees.Sir Auckland Geddes pointed out that it would be impossible toaccept the suggestion of Mr. Prothero, as some 25,000 out of the30,000 required from England would be posted by Sunday night.It was undoubtedly true that the quota in certain Counties had been too heavy, but, from information which had been supplied to him,it appeared that some Counties, such as Cumberland, Westmorland,and Durham, had not been strained over hard.The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food expressedthe opinion .that the number which had been taken from agriculturewas the extreme limit. In fact, Mr. Clynes said, he thought it was essential to restore some of the men to the farms if there was to beno waste of food, as neither woman, German, nor home labour couldbe used to supply the necessary services which were essential.The Secretary of .State for War pointed out that the army was far short already, not only of the numbers which the War Officehoped to get, but of the numbers on which the maintenance of theforces depended. So far as agriculture was concerned, it would not make much difference to the army if a certain number of men were allowed to stay out until the harvest was over, and would join thecolours afterwards, but he regarded the calling back of the men whowere already with the colours as a very serious matter. Lord Milnersaid that he could not believe that 30,000 men could not have beentaken from agriculture without the necessity of removing the onlyworkers on a farm.The Prime Minister said that cases had been brought to hisnotice in which the only men on a farm had been called up ; thatthere were threats of agricultural strikes, and that undoubtedly therewere very many individual hard cases which it would be most difficult to defend in the House of Commons. There would be a debate on the following day on this subject in the House, andMr. Lloyd George expressed the opinion that the time had come when the need for men for the army should be restated.   He would
198GovernmentOrganisation:Treasury Eepre-sentation on theCommittee ofHome Affairs.15. With reference to War Cabinet 431, Minute 10, the WarCabinet approved the addition of the name of Mr. Stanley Baldwin,Joint Financial Secretary to the Treasury, to the Standing Committeeof Home Affairs.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 26, 1918.like the War Cabinet to realise what these demands meant withregard to our man-power. The proposals of 9th April, which weremade in connection with the Military Service Act (No. 2), 1918, were then regarded as essential. Since that time it had been foundnecessary not to call up 25,000 men from the mines, because coalcould not be procured and ships were lying idle in ports for want ofbunker coal. It was now proposed to deduct 15,000 from the quotato be supplied by agriculture, and another 15,000 were goingto be asked for from the mines. The Ministry of munitions and the Admiralty were requesting about 2,000 men to be exempted. Mr. Lloyd George pointed out that this totalled 57,000Grade I men, and, as the total number which it was expected toobtain of this grade from the effect of the Act passed last April wasonly 200,000, these deductions would come to a quarter of that totalat a time when every young man was essential for combatant work.It was pointed out that there was a feeling in the country thatthe American reinforcements would be able to relieve the strain onour armies at the front.Lord Milner said that, when we made an appeal to America, towhich it had responded so well, we said that we ourselves were making an effort in order that, by the autumn, we should be able toplay our part agaizi in France.Mr. Prothero said that the Board of Agriculture were not con-testing the clean cut, aud that the ages involved were from 19 to 31.Sir Auckland Geddes pointed out that any decision arrived at by the War Cabinet should be one which could be administered,and that it was necessary that sufficient interval should elapsebetween the taking of the decision and its becoming operative toallow of orders being issued to all parts of the country. Menfrom agriculture were coming in from all over the country, andthe only possible way in which any alteration could be dealt withadministratively -was to stop the issue of calling-up notices as soonas possible. At the same time, if this were done, it should becoupled with an earnest endeavour to get more men from counties and districts where the present quota had been reached without undue strain.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) No more calling-up notices should be issued to men employed in agriculture (as defined in agreements between the Ministry of National Service and the Boardof Agriculture and Fisheries) until after the harvest ;(b.) The calling up of tube-makers for the Admiralty should be proceeded with in accordance with War Cabinet 431,Minute 5, but that, if the Admiralty, the Ministry ofMunitions, or other Departments, considered that the calling up of particular men in certain industriesseriously affected the prosecution of the war, theDepartment concerned should make application to thenavy or the army, as the case might be, asking that individual men essential to the industries concerned should be released.
