The western front.1. THE Director of Military Intelligence reported that thesituation was unchanged on the Western front.GermanEeinforcements.2. The Director of Military Intelligence said that the german prisoners released from Russia had begun to appear in German unitson the Western front. The number available as an increase to theGerman man-power was at present about 50,000, but GeneralMacdonogh expressed the opinion that this number would increase,in view of the fact that about 200,000 Germans had been takenprisoners by the Russians. A large number of these, for various reasons, would not return, and lie was of opinion that 100,000 couldbe given as an outside number of possible reinforcements from this source.General Macdonogh said that Prince Rupprecht had now40 divisions in reserve, of which only 6 had been less than one month out of the nring- line.The Caucasus. 3. &quot;With reference to Imperial War Cabinet 21, Minute 4, theDirector of Military Intelligence reported that General Marshall had telegraphed that he had yet received no news from Enzeli, and thata report had been received from Miaue that the Turks had advancedfrom Tabriz to the Shabli Pass.East Africa.4. With reference to War Cabinet 430, Minute 10 the Directorof Military Intelligence reported that an advanced company of the2/3 King&apos;s African Rifles reached Quelinano on. the 26th June, andwas proceeding to Alhamacurra on the following daj&apos;.Herr von Kvihl-mann&apos;s Speech inthe Reichstag.5. Questioned as to whether the War Office considered thatthe speech recently delivered by 11 err von Kuhlmann had beeninspired by General Ludendorff, the Director of Military Intelligencesaid that he was strongly of opinion that General Ludendorff hadbeen consulted before th.-- speech was delivered. There had been agreat deal of comment on the speech in Germany, and it was evident that it was very unpalatable to the majority of theGerman people.Lord Curzon expressed the opinion that Herr von Kuhlmannwould never have dared to make the speech without the sanction of the German military authorities.Lord Milner said it appeared to him that, while Germany stillintended to make a big military effort in order to win the war,yet the object of the speech, seemed to indicate that the groundshould, be prepared for any criticism in case the military offensivewas not successful.(i. The First Sea Lord reported that three of our coastalmotor-boats were in action on the night of the 26-27th June,about 7 miles north of Zeebrugge mole, with four enemy torpedo-boat destroyers. Torpedoes were fired by our ships, and one hitwas claimed.   All the boats had returned safety.Action by Belgian 7. The First Sea Lord reported that, on the evening of the 27thCoast Patrol. June, the Belgian coast patrol destroyers, with monitors in support,sighted eight enemy torpedo -boat destroyers. Our patrol engaged theenemy at 12,000 yards, closing to 8,000, firing four torpedoeswithout success. The small monitors, with H.M.S. &quot; Terror,&quot;followed at fullest speed, but never sighted the enemy. Three moreenemy torpedodaoat destroyers were subsequently sighted, and our naval Action offZeebrugge.
patrol fell back on tbe monitors, but tbe enemy did not follow. Theaction lasted fifteen minutes. The casualties were very slight, fourmen being wounded. Questioned as to whether these enemy destroyers came out of Zeebrugge Canal, Admiral Wemyss expressedthe opinion that it was very doubtful whether they were destroyers and not torpedo-boats. An air reconnaissance was being made that morning, but no report had yet been received.It was pointed out that it would be advisable for an officialcommunique to be issued to the press before a German report wasreceived.Admiral Wemyss undertook to see that this was done.Bombing bandints. 8. The First Sea Lord reported that the usual bombing attacks had been made on Zeebrugge and Bruges. On 2Gth dune three british machines from Otranto had raided Durazzo, reporting adirect hit on the seaplane jetty and buildings adjoining, and that the seaplane base had been set on fire. All the machines returned safely.Submarines. p. The  First Sea  Ford reported that a periscope had been sighted off Rattray Head. Depth charges had been dropped, and itwas considered that the submarine was destroyed, as reports hadbeen received that oil was coming up all clay. Questioned as towhether it could not be considered certain that a submarine hadbeen destroyed when oil and bidjbles were seen, Admiral Wemysspointed out that, while this was the probable conclusion to be arrived at, yet there was so touch oil all round the coast that theAdmiralty did not like to state definitely the destruction of sub-marines in all cases where oil and bubbles were seen.British Destroyers 10. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that a report111 Collision, had been received from the Commander-in-chief of the Grand fleet to the effect that H.M.S. &quot; Vancouver &quot; and H.M.S. &quot; Wessex &quot; werein collision on 26th dune; that both vessels had been severely damaged, and that the total casualties were 5 killed, 3 injured, and 1missing.Committee of 11. With reference to Imperial War Cabinet 19, Minute 8, thePrime Ministers. Prime Minister was asked whether he could give the &quot;War &quot;Cabinetany information as to the course which the Committee of PrimeMinisters was taking, and Mr. Lloyd George said that, up to thepresent, the Prime Ministers had been, in the main, asking forinformation. Xo definite decisions had been arrived at, with theexception of the decision on the Russian situation (Imperial AVarCabinet 21, Minute 10), which had already been communicated tothe members of the AA*ar CabinetThe Czecho-Slovak \2. The Prime Minister drew the attention of the AVar CabinetForces, to the necessity of making financial arrangements in order to enablethe Czecho-Slovaks to pay their way in Russia and Siberia.Mr. Lloyd George expressed the opinion that it was most desirablethat these forces should be in a position to pay, as it was essentialthat the poptdation should remain friendly to them.In the discussion which followed, it was pointed out that theFrench authorities had made all the arrangements to bring the czecho-Slovak troops to Vladivostok, and that previous financial arrangements with regard to the troops in the Ukraine had beenmade between General Foch and the Director of Military Intelligence.
The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Director of Military Intelligence should put himself in communication with the French military authorities,in order that the financial arrangements might be madeto place the necessary money at the disposal of the czecho-Slovak troops, for use either on their way toVladivostok or in Russia or Siberia.(?).) The amount expended, and the financial details, should besubject to the concurrence of the Treasury.Allied Intervention 13. With reference to imperial War Cabinet 21, Minute 10, thein Russia. Prime Minister drew the attention of the  War Cabinet to theimpression which apparently prevailed in America that there was a division of opinion among the Allies on the subject of intervention in Russia.Attention was called to the telegram on this subject receivedfrom Lord Reading the previous clay.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that a telegram was now being prepared and would be sent to-day to Lord Readingrequesting President Wilson not to commit himself on this question.Periodical Publica- i 4. Owing to the absence of the Chief of the Imperial GeneralSKtaf ST&apos;    Staff, the War-Cabinet decided-Casualties. To defer the consideration of the question of the periodicalpublication in America of the total British casualties untilhis return.Exchange of 15, The Prime Minister asked when it was expected that the prisoners of War. Secretary of State for Home Affairs would return to England. Inview of the maixy questions in connection with which his presencewas necessary, Mr. Lloyd George expressed the opinion that itwould be desirable that Sir George Gave should return as soon aspossible.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook to send atelegram to Sir George Cave to this effect.Life of Parliament: 10- With reference to War Cabinet 434, Minute 6, the WarLocal Elections. Cabinet had under consideration a memorandum by Mr. HayesFisher on the subject of the prolongation of the life of parliament and the holding of local elections (Paper G.T.-4935), and amemorandum by the President of the Local Government Board(Paper G.T.-4b09).Mr. Hayes Fisher pointed out that it was necessary for the life of Parliament, which now stands extended until the 31st July next,to be further exttnded, and suggested that the extension should befor six months, namely, until the 31st January, 1919. Mr. HayesFisher said that it would, of course, be possible to have an electionat any time on the new register after the 1st October, and if ageneral election were not desired before the 31st January, 1919,there would be time for a further extension, should urgent military or other reasons make this necessary- With regard to municipalelections Mr. Hayes Fisher said that the Municipal CorporationsAssociation were distinctly opposed to the holding of elections nextNovember, and also to the proposal that the new register should bemade the occasion of a complete new election of the whole Counciland not merely of one-third, as is customary under the present law.He fully supported these views, mainly because a large number of
mcouncillors were now serving on committees dealing with war work,who had gained considerable experience, and it would he veryunfortunate if, by their failing to be elected, their services were lost to the locality. No question had been raised in Parliamentpreviously on the subject of holding municipal elections, but one was on the paper now, which would require an answer. Mr. HayesFisher explained that the extension of local elections would apply only to those which took place before the 1st March, which would cover the Irish borough and urban district elections but not theEnglish county or district council elections.The War Cabinet approved the proposals put forward in thememorandum by the President of the Local Government(Paper G.T.-4935).17. The attention of the War Cabinet was called to the dis-satisfaction which existed in regard to the treatment of meninvalided from the army still needing medical attention.It was pointed out that these men were often discharged and told to go to civil hospitals for treatment, but that the necessarypapers were not sent to the hospitals for a considerable time, andconsequently their medical history was unknown to the authoritiesand the men failed to get proper attention. Cases were quoted inwhich men, failing to get adequate treatment, had attempted bydesperate methods to get back to the army in order that they mightsecure attention.The War Cabinet requested The Secretary of State for War to issue instructions to theDepartments concerned, in order that the necessary papersconcerning men invalided from the Army might be received at the civil hospitals before the arrival of the men to whom they relate.Coal Miners&apos; 18. With reference to War Cabinet 240, Minute 10, the War&quot;Wages. Cabinet had before them a memorandum by Sir Albert Stanleyi Paper G.T.-4959), in regard to the application of the Miners&apos;Federation for a further increase in war wage of Is. 6d. per day, or9s. a week, to miners over 10 years of age, and of 9cZ. per day tothose under 16 years of age, thereby doubling the war bonusobtained in September 1917.Sir Albert Stanley pointed out that the Controller of Coal Mineshad met the Executive of the Miners&apos; Federation on the 25th June,and had offered an advance of 6d. and 3d. -per day, although,according to the figures showing the increase in the cost of livingsince the 1st October last, even this amount was scarcely justified.In addition to offering this compromise, the Coal Controller had proposed that a Committee should be appointed, consisting of twonominees of the Mining Association of Great Britain and twonominees of the Miners1 Federation, together with a neutralchairman to be appointed by the Government, who should examinethe question of increase in cost of living and earnings. Both theseoffers, however, had been declined by the representatives of thecoal miners, it being alleged that they had received the instructions of their Conference not to barter in connection with this application,which was the minimum the Conference was prepared to allow themto accept. In view of the fact that a compromise was impossible,there were only two alternatives, either to refuse or grant the applica-tion. If the demand was refused, then a strike must be faced, and thecoal position to-day did not admit of stoppage. The effect of a strikeupon munition works, essential industries, and shipping would be disastrous. France and Italy, without a steady supply of coal fromthis country, could not continue in the war. In addition, we hadobligations towards neutrals, such as Sweden, whereby we suppliedTreatment ofInvalided Soldiersfrom the Army.
coal in return for ships. Our own shipping, in the event of a strike,would begin to he stacked up in our ports. Moreover, it was by nomeans certain that public sympathy would be on the side of theGovernment if their refusal of the application resulted in a strike.As to wages generally, Sir Albert Stanley gave figures showing that,while the miners during tbe war had had their wages almostdoubled, the railwaymen, on an average, had also had their wagespractically doubled. It was true to say that there had been substantial increases throughout the whole field of labour.Sir Stephenson Kent, in opposing the proposal to grant theminers&apos; demand, said, that he thought the time had come to call ahalt. Wages generally were mounting up and up all along the line,and workpeople were taking advantage of the situation. Forinstance, there were cases of skilled mechanics going in and out of shops for a matter of a few hours in order to better their wages, and employers did not seem to care, owing to the operation of the ExcessProfits Tax. It was the spirit of the times. He strongly urged thatit was impossible to single out one trade, like the coal trade, for anincrease in wages without starting the whole cycle of wages in alltrades. He believed that acceptance of the miners&apos; applicationwould spread unrest without resulting in increase of work.Sir David Shackleton, supporting what Sir Stephenson Kenthad said about starting another cycle of wage-raising, said that thework of the Ministry of Labour would be made very difficult to carryon if the miners were allowed to enforce their own terms. Theminers were demanding the additional 9s. a week simply becausethey knew their power, and it was not fair to the other trades whohad agreed to arbitration. His advice was to resist the miners&apos;application, to place tbe whole facts before the public, and to face a strike.It was pointed out, on the other hand, that this was advice togo to war - with the miners-a war which, having regard to themilitary situation, and the need for coal, as shown by the Presidentof the Board of Trade, ought not to be risked.Sir Guy Calthrop said that already this week seven pits were&quot; out&quot; because it was said that there had been too much delay overthe negotiations. As an example of how trouble in the coalfieldsspread, reference was made to a recent dispute in the Tredegarmines on a point of discipline in the Union ; the miners&apos; leaders inthis case had been in sympathy with the Government, and had asked that the men who had caused the trouble should not be reinstated ;nevertheless, the trouble, at first local, had spread until 150,000 tonsof coal had been lost, and in the end the men in question had to bereinstated.The War Cabinet then had sonic discussion amongst themselves as to whether the application should be granted or refused. Oneview was expressed, that the advice of the representatives of theMinistry of Labour should be adopted ; that the demand should be resisted ; that the Covermnent should debate the matter in parliament and appeal to the nation. The majority of the Cabinet, however,while recognising that, in other times and in other trades, a strikecould be afforded, were of opinion that, at the present time and inthis particular trade, the risk was too great to be run.The War Cabinet decided that -(a.) The application of the Miners&apos; Federation for the present war Bonus of Is. 6d. per day to miners over lb years ofage and of 9d. per day to those under Hi years of age tobe doubled should be granted, on the express under-standing that the miners should increase their output.(6.) The President of the Board of Trade should prepare astatement on the subject for the Prime Minister.(c.) The announcement should be made by the Prime Ministerto the representatives of the miners the same eveningat 6 cm
New Accommoda- 19. Tlie War Cabinet bad before them a memorandum by the for the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Paper G.T.-49:H) in regardDepartment of ^Q new acc0mmodation for the Department of Overseas Trade. Inveiseas ra o.  .g memoranrjum the Foreign Secretary pointed out that the Officeof Works had undertaken to erect, immediately, buildings on the horse Guards Parade to accommodate the staff, provided thesanction of the War Cabinet was obtained, and this was nowurgently requested.The War Cabinet sanctioned this proposal, subject to theapproval of the War Priority Committee.British EconomicBelations withBussia.20. The War Cabinet took note of the recommendations of theEconomic Defence and Development Committee, as set forth in the note by the Secretary (Paper G.T.-4944).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 28, 1918.
