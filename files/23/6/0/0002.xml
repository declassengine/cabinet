THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theonly news from the Western front was to the effect that the twoFrench divisions which had been with the Vth Army in front ofAmiens were now no longer under General Rawlinson. The Frenchline now covered both banks of the Luce up to Hangard, and ourfront had been correspondingly shortened.
The Co-ordinationof the higher command.2. With reference to War Cabinet 574, Minute 9, the WarCabinet discussed the question of the co-ordination of the higher command, with special reference to the Prime Ministers proposed visit to France.It was pointed out that co-ordination between General Fochand the French Higher Command was no less important thanbetween him and the- British Higher Command, and that the formermight be the more difficult to secure having regard to the experience in General Nivelle&apos;s attack a year ago. It was felt that the PrimeMinister should do his utmost to secure that, during the present crisis, both the British and French Commanders-in-chief should conform to the instructions of General Foch.It was stated that a very serious misunderstanding wasrumoured to have arisen, at a most critical stage of the battle, as tothe responsibility for the defence of the sector immediately south ofthe Somme and nearest to Amiens.In this connection the Chief of the Imperial General staff pointed out that any misunderstanding which may have arisenwas probably unavoidable, and due to a complete breakdown oftelephonic communications consequent on the sudden retreat and thechange of various Headquarters. The responsibility was now clearly defined and understood.The question was discussed as to whether, in order to securecomplete co-ordination in the French command, it might not bedesirable to extend General Foch&apos;s powers, so as to give him theright of issuing directions or orders, instead of being limited toco-ordination.In regard to this, the Chief of the Imperial General staff pointed out that General Foch himself probably did not require any powers in extension of those already accorded to him.The view was expressed that it would be inadvisable to extendin the letter an arrangement which was reported to be working well,so tar as the British army was concerned, and had been well receivedby public opinion in the country.The War Cabinet decided, that The decisions must be left to the discretion of the PrimeMinister, after he had had an opportunity to discuss thewhole question with Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig.Co-operation of theUnited States ofAmerica.3. The War Cabinet approved a telegram (No. 1887) fromthe Prime Minister to Lord Beading urging upon the latter to makehimself responsible for a. number of practical measures for expediting the transport of United States troops the LiehnowskyBevelations:Propaganda.4. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to thedesirability of making known as widely as possible the revelations of&apos;nnceLichnowsky and also of Dr. Muhlon.The War Cabinet decided that-Copies of the papers in question should be distributed as widelyas possible by the Ministry of Propaganda, both in thiscountry and abroad.Eussian black sea Fleet.   .5. With reference to War Cabinet 370, Minutes 18 and 19, theFirst Sea Lord reported that he had received a telegram fromthe French attache in Boumania, which said that the KieffGovernment had forbidden the formation of Naval Volunteer Corps,had  suppressed  the  election of officers, and had given orders forthe demobilisation   of the  Black Sea fleet.the telegram also
stated that these measures were preparatory to handing over thefleet to the Germans, and that certain forts in Sebastopol had beenseized by armed bands of German prisoners who had been set freein the country. Sir Rosslyn Wemyss was of opinion that too muchreliance could not be placed on this information, but, even if itwere correct, sufficient forces were available to counter any suchmovement. At the same time, he was of opinion that it would bevery desirable that the Allied Naval Council should hold its next meeting at the same time and place as the next meeting of theSupreme War Council, so that the views of the Allied NavalCouncil could be represented, in order that any necessaryconcerted action by the Allied fleets could be taken.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,April 3, 1918.
