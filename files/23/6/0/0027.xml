With reference to War Cabinet 366, Minute 11, the PrimeMinister informed the War Cabinet that the following resolutionshad been agreed to at the Meeting of the Supreme War Council,held at Abbeville oh&apos; the 1st and 2nd May, 1918 : (a.) In view of the fact that the Allied Forces at Salonica arebeing reinforced by the addition of Greek divisions, the
3WO 405The executive war Board.The Allied naval forces in theMediterranean.The Extension ofGeneral Foch&apos;sPowers to theItalian Pront.Supreme War Council are of opinion that it ought tohe possible, without endangering the position in theSalonica theatre, to transfer some battalions to theWestern front, where every man is urgently needed.(6.) They are agreed, however, that no transfer should takeplace without consultation with the General OfficerCommanding the Allied Army in the Salonica theatre,who is responsible for the protection of the Alliedinterests in that region.(c.) The Supreme War Council agree that a French and aBritish General Officer should he despatched forthwith to Salonica, where, in association with the General OfficerCommanding the Italian forces at Salonica, they are toconfer with General Guillaumat on this cpmstion, inorder, if possible, to arrange with him for the immediatewithdrawal of Allied battalions. The Supreme WarCouncil iDarticularly commend to the attention of these officers the suggestion in General GuillaumaFs despatchof the 30th April, that Indian battalions should besubstituted for British battalions to be withdrawn to theWestern front.(d.) The Supreme War Council are agreed that, in view of theappointment of General Foch as General-in-Chief of theAllied Armies on the Western front, the Executive war board, set up at the Meeting of the Supreme WarCouncil held on 2nd February, should be dissolved.(e.) The Supreme War Council, having considered the docu-ments presented to them as the result of the ThirdMeeting of the Allied Naval Council held in Paris onthe 26th and 27th April, 1918, take note that, inprinciple, there is a general agreement that the transfer to Corfu of Italian dreadnoughts would be desirable,in order to set free French battleships for an increaseof the Allied naval forces in the JEgean. In view ofthe great importance of taking steps to meet the new situation created in the Eastern Mediterranean by the threatened seizure of the Eussian Black Sea Fleet bythe enemy, the Supreme War Council urge the ItalianGovernment to give their consent to the proposals of theAllied Naval Council, and to carry them out with theleast possible delay.(/.) General Foch is Commander-in-Chief of the Italian troops on the French front, just as he is of the other allied troops.(g.) The powers of co-ordination conferred on General Foch bythe agreement of Boullens are extended to the italian front.Qi.) If circumstances bring about the presence on the italian front of Allied armies fighting together in the same conditions as in France, SigDor Orlando would accept that there should be a General-in-Chief of the allied armies on the Western front, and that this General-in-Chief shotdcl be General Foch.It is understood First: That the western front extends from theNorth Sea to the Adriatic.Second:  That, in conformity with the BeauvaisAgreement, the General in command of one of
The Transportationof Czech troops from Eussia.The Co-operationof the american army.The Utilisation of -Belgian RailwayEesources.The Shipment ofBoiling-stock fromthe United Statesof America.the Allied armies can always refer to hisGovernment if he considers that the ordersreceived from the General-in-Chief constitute a danger to his army.(?&apos;.) The Supreme War Council approve Note 25 of the military representatives, and agree on the following action : (a.) The British Government undertake to do their best to arrange the transportation of thoseCzech troops who are at Vladivostock or ontheir way to that port.(6.) The French Government undertake the respon-sibility of these troops until they areembarked.(c.) The British Government undertake to approachM. Trotzki with a view to the concentrationat Murmansk and Archangel of those czech troops not belonging to the army corpswhich have left Omsk for Vladivostock.(j.) It is the opinion, of the Supreme War Council that, inorder to carry the war to a successful conclusion, an american army should be formed as early as possible under its own commander and under its own flag.In order to meet the present emergency, it is agreedthat American troops should be brought to France as rapidly as Allied transportation facilities will permit,and that, as far as consistent with the necessity ofbuilding up an American army, preference be given toinfantry and machine-gun units for training and service with French and British armies, with the understandingthat such infantry and machine-gun units are to be withdrawn and united with&apos; its own artillery and auxiliary troops into divisions and corps at the discretion of the American Commander-in-Chief after consultationwith the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Armies inFrance.It is also agreed that, during the month of May,preference should be given to the transportation of infantry and machine-gun units of six divisions, and thatany excess tonnage shall be devoted, to bringing oversuch other troops as may be determined by the AmericanCommander-in-Chief.It is further agreed that this programme shall becontinued during the month of June, upon condition that the British Government shall furnish transportationfor a minimum of 130,000 men in May and 150,000 menin June, with the understanding that the first six divisions of infantry shall go to the British for training and service, and that troops sent over in June shall be allocated for training and service as the AmericanCommander-in-Chief may determine.It is also further agreed that, if the British Govern-riient shall transport an excess of 150,000 in June, s\ichexcess shall be infantry and machine-gun units, and that early in June there shall be a new review of the situation to determine further action.(fe.) The Supreme War Council approve Joint Note No. 23 ofthe Permanent Military Representatives, on the subjectof the utilisation of Belgian railway resources.(I.) The Supreme War Council approve Joint Note No. 24 ofthe Permanent Military Representatives, on the subject
of the shipment of rolling-stock from the United Statesof America.The War Cabinet approved the foregoing Resolu-tions.Co-operation ofthe United Statesof America.9. With reference to War Cabinet 404, Minute 4, the PrimeMinister communicated to the War Cabinet the agreement reached by the Supreme War Council at Abbeville, as set forth above(Minute S (10)), in regard to the co-operation of United states troops. This agreement, he said, extended the agreement reached between Lord Milner and General Pershing. The cause of all the trouble, the Prime Minister said, was that President Wilson had put us in a difficulty by leaving to us the necessity of bargaining withGeneral Pershing. &quot;Che latter had refused to treat the men shippedin April, but arriving in May, as part of the April contingent. after a very prolonged discussion General Pershing had been persuaded to extend to June the agreement he had reached with Lord Milnerfor the transport of 120,000 infantry and machine-gunners in May.He had only agreed to this, however, on the understanding that theBritish Government would provide shipping for 150,000 men. Con-sequently, as a result of this arrangement, the whole of the Americanshipping and British tonnage for 30,000 infantry would be devotedin J une to carrying out General Pershing&apos;s divisional programme.-During the Conference the Prime Minister had heard from theShipping Controller that he believed he could bring 200,000 infantryin June. The Prime Minister had then asked General Pershingwhether, in the event of our finding it possible to ship an additional50,000 men, he would agree that these should consist of infantry and machine-guns, and General Pershing had assented. Thus, asthe result of the agreement, we had ensured transport of the follow-ing infantry and machine-gunners : MayJune120,000170,000The Franco-German Agree-ment in regard to prisoners of War.290,000There was some discussion as to whether the six divisionsreferred to in Lord milner&apos;s agreement with General Pershing wouldin fact amount to as many as 120,000 men.Lord Milner said that every one of the 120,000 men would be valuable troops. The American division amounted in all to 27,865men,and the portions of it to be attached to the British were thefollowing: divisional headquarters, 2 infantry brigades, a divisionalmachine-gun battalion, a regiment of engineers, a field signalbattalion, an engineer train, headquarters train and military police.The divisional headquarters number 238. The infantry brigades,consisting almost entirely of combatant troops, made up 16,330, the divisional machine-gun battalion 393, the regiment of engineers1,697, the field signal battalion 488 ; and this, together with theengineer train 84, headquarters train and military police 374, made up a total of 20,104. The remaining portions of each division,chiefly artillerymen, were to go direct to General Pershing.10. The Prime Minister informed his colleagues, of a discussion that had been held at a conference between the British and french governments and their Military Representatives at Abbeville duringthe recent session of the Supreme War Council in regard to therecent Franco-German agreement for the exchange of prisoners ofAvar. M. Clemenceau, the Prime Minister said, had told him thatthe societies and persons interested in prisoners of war in france had acquired considerable political importance, and that the Govern-ment had been forced to enter into this agreement. Mr. LloydGeorge had then informed M. Clemenceau that there had also beena good deal of pressure put on the British Government. He himself had then seen the Members of Parliament who were mainlv interested
in the question, and had pointed out to them that any general exchangeof prisoners would involve a great increase to the man-power ofGermany, and a consequential prolongation of the war. Unless, there-fore, we were prepared to trust Germany to keep her word in thematter, the results might be very serious. When they were asked asto whether they were prepared to trust so much to German good faith, the Members of Parliament consulted at once admitted thatthey were not, and the question had been dropped. M. Clemenceauhad been visibly influenced by these arguments, and had ended by saying that &quot;You can leave it to me.&quot; He had also volunteeredto send a copy of the agreement to Lord Miiner, with a view to consultation.Proposed Visit bythe King of the belgians. , -British casulties on the western front.II. Lord Curzon read to the War Cabinet a letter he hadreceived, from the King of the Belgians, in which he intimated a willingness to pay his long-deferred visit to England whenever themilitary situation became clearer and the fighting settled down.King Albert also mentioned that he would be glad to visit theGrand Fleet.The War Cabinet were generally agreed that it would be advantageous to obtain closer touch with the King of the Belgians,who was actually Commander-in-Chief of the Belgian Army inthe held.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, in reply to a question as to when the military situation was likely to become clearer, saidthat the only safe assumption was that the Germans would continueattacking all through the summer. He suggested that the best plan would be to allow the King of the Belgians to select themoment he judged most favourable for his visit.Lord Curzon was authorised by the War Cabinet to consultPlis Majesty the King on the question, and, subject to his approval, to invite King Albert to visit this country at thefirst favourable opportunity.12. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinetthat the British casualties since&apos; the 21st March were still below300,000.IndiscreetQuestions inParliament.13. The Secretary of State for War drew the attention of theWar Cabinet to the following question in Parliament, which hadbeen put down for the 1st May : &quot; Soldiers Leave.&quot; Mr. Watt asked whether the soldiers who have been threeyears in Gallipoli, Egypt, and Palestine, as, for example, the1/6 Highland Light Infantry, and who have been moved toFrance, will be given first leave when circumstances permit, inview of the facts that they have been so long abroad and thatthey were promised early leave on the evacuation of Gallipoli.&quot;It was pointed out that this question of itself gave valuableinformation to the enemy, since it recorded the transfer of a unitfrom Palestine to the Western front, which would give the clue tothe enemy that a division had been transferred. It was generally agreed that it was very wrong that the privileges&apos; of Members ofParliament should be so used, even though innocently, as to give information to the enemy.Mr. Bonar Law explained that if the Clerks at the Table of theHouse of Commons considered a question dangerous, they were instructed to draw the attention of the War Office to the matter.It was evident that they had not realised the significance of thisquestion.
The Secretary of State for War undertook to discuss the matter with Mr. Macpherson, in order that the Clerks at the table of the House of Commons might be warned that any information of the movements of units between thedifferent theatres of war was dangerous.Ireland. 14. A.t Mr. ChamberlahFs suggestion, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs undertook to notify to the British representative atthe Vatican any cases that might come to fight of the improperinterference of the Irish priesthood in secular affairs, and moreparticularly the recent promise of absolution to persons engaged inresistance to the Military Service Act.Norwegian Pyrites. 15. With reference to War Cabinet 404, Minute 15, the WarCabinet had before them a memorandum by Lord Robert Cecil(Paper G.T.-443G) in which he pointed out that the subject hadbeen discussed at the Cabinet on the 3rd May, in the absence of anyrepresentative of the Foreign Office or of the Ministry of Blockade.He therefore asked for a reconsideration of the matter. Threeaspects of the case wrere examined, namely : (a.) The question of price.(6.) The post helium problem.(c.) The recently signed Norwegian Agreement.As to price, Lord Robert Cecil said that we had been repeatedlyassured by Sir M. Findlay, who was not likely to be mistaken on sucha point, that it only exceeded the cost of production by a smalladditional profit. A telegram ^No. 1399) of the 3rd May, receivedfrom Sir M. Findlay since the meeting of the Cabinet on that day,showed thai the enemy agents were offering double the price inquestion for storage till after the war.With regard to the argument previously cited (War Cabinet 404,Minute 15), that the result of paying the Norwegian price wouldforce up the Spanish price, Lord Milner said he did not think thatthe Rio Tinto Company would raise their price, because Sir C.Fielding fully realised that the company was dependent on theBritish Government, and had received special facilities in regard to coal freights (War Cabinet 351, Minute 11).Sir L. Worthington Evans and Dr. Addison concurred in LordMilneFs view.As to the Economic Offensive aspect of the case, Lord robert cecil said he did not think that the importance of this had been sufficiently realised at the previous meeting. It was certain thatthe Germans would be badly in need of sulphuric acid afterthe war.Dr. Addison, in support of this argument, said that, after wooland cotton, there would hardly be any commodity that it wouldbe more desirable to control than pyrites. It was one of the mose essential materials which the Germans would require for sulphuricacid for the manufacture of superphosphates for fertilising theirstarved land.As regards the Norwegian Agreement, it was pointed out thatthe Cabinet had reached their conclusion on the 3rd May in the belief that the Germans could not buy and store the Norwegianpyrites. Now, however, it was stated that the Germans could do so,because the Norwegian-American Agreement only dealt with theexport of pyrites.   This fact greatly altered the case.In these circumstances the War Cabinet decided that Their decision recorded in War Cabinet 404, Minute 15, shouldbe rescinded, and that the purchase of the Norwegian
Greek Mobilisa-tion.Proposed mission to the UnitedStates of America.Visit of aDistinguishedDutchman toEngland.pyrites, on the terms set forth in Paper G.T.-4424, shouldbe made by the Ministry of Munitions and receive Treasurysanction..1 6. With reference to War Cabinet 395, Minute 11, the attentionof the War Cabinet was drawn to a series of rulings given by general smuts on the subject of Greek mobilisation (Paper G.T.-4362).The War Cabinet noted and approved, the rulings set forth inthat document.17. With reference to War Cabinet 402, Minute 11, recording the War Cabinet/s decision to delay the departure of Sir LyndenMacassey&apos;s mission to the United States pending a ruling by thePrime Minister, Mr. Lloyd George concurred in the decision, and expressed the opinion that, for the present it was undesirable thatthe mission should proceed.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was requested, toinform Lord Reading of this decision.was a peace.18. The War Cabinet had a short discussion on the subject ofthe visit of M. Colign, a distinguished Dutchman, who, at one time,had been Minister of War in Holland. The War Cabinet were informed that M. Colign bad visited England with the assent of,and possibly at the invitation of, the Ministry of Information. Someof the newspapers, however, had got the idea that hepro-German and was connected with the &quot; german offensive.&quot;Lord Robert Cecil stated that, in giving an interview to someAmerican journalists, he had been questioned about the peace offensive and had made some remarks as to its probability. Theseremarks had been interpreted, in some quarters, as being directed against M. Colign, although, as a matter of fact, he was not at thetime aware that M. Colign was in this country.General Smuts said it had been suggested to him by theMinistry of Information, as well as by the Dutch Minister, that heshould have a talk with an eminent Dutchman on a visit to thiscountry, who had turned out to be M. Colign. They had had a talktogether, and he had found M. Colign took a very sane view of thewhole situation, and had not shown the smallest taint of pro-Germanism, neither had he given the smallest hint of having been entrusted with any sort of peace offer. He understood thatM. Colign was a very important person in a petroleum combine, andhad big business connections with this country.It was not quite clear to the War Cabinet whether M. Colignhad visited this country primarily for business reasons, or by directinvitation of the Ministry of Information, but the War cabinet decided that As a general rule, the Foreign Office should be notifiedwhenever important public men were invited by aGovernment Department to visit this country.It was generally agreed that The information given in regard to M. Colign would enablethe Foreign Office to dispose, without difficulty, ofMr. Snowden&apos;s question in the..House of Commons that afternoon, which suggested that a distinguished neutralhad come to this country with offers of peace.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 0, 1918.
