The Western 1. The Director of Military Operations explained the situation^&quot;ront- on the Western front by means of a map, and stated that theGermans had not reached Chateau-Thierry, but had advanced tothe Marne on a small front.   Heavy fighting was taking jdace to thenorth-east of   Chateau-Thierry, and the Germans had made an advance of about 4 miles since yesterday in that direction.   Theposition at Rheims was uncertain.   In reply to a question as towhether he could offer any explanation for this rapid advance onthe part of the Germans, General Radcliffe stated that it appeared that, in the first night, a gap occurred in the line on the RiverVesle, and they pressed through this, possibly with armoured cars.He mentioned that, unless the Germans extended the Avidth of theirsalient, their advance could not materially progress, and that atpresent they were in a dangerous position if General Foch was ableto bring up reserves on either side.   In this connection the Directorof Military Operations pointed out that the whole of the troopsemployed in the present offensive were from the Crown Prince&apos;s army.   We had identified 26 German divisions, and estimated thenumber employed at from 30 to 36 divisions.   The French estimatewas from 40 to 45 divisions.   The whole of Prince RupprechFsarmy in the north was intact, and consisted of 45 divisions, of which.17 were fresh.   General Foch had to bear this fact prominently inmind in considering any withdrawal of Allied divisions facingPrince Rupprecht&apos;s army.   Asked as to what action had takenplace as regards the transfer of troops from other portions of the &apos;allied line, General Raclcliffe stated that General Foch had moved from 15 to 16 divisions from south of the Somme, and he had warned the Xth French Army, under General Maistre, to be readyto move.   General Radcliffe was of opinion that the Allies hadsustained great losses in men and guns.   As regards the Britishcorps, he had received a report that the 8th Division had sustained5,000 casualties and two other divisions 2,000 to 3,000 each.   Theonly British division now in the line was the 19th, which wasfighting very well.   The remainder of the IXth Corps had been withdrawn.american reinforcements.2.

G.T.-4697)  from   the   Secretary  of the Young Men&apos;s ChristianAssociation, relative to setting apart a day as a day of publichumiliation, prayer, and fasting.Attention was drawn to the decision in War Cabinet 252,Minute 3, and the War Cabinet decided that Subject to the Prime Ministers approval, they should notentertain the suggestion.Exchange of 7. With reference to War Cabinet 419, Minute 1.0, the WarPrisoners of War. Cabinet had before them the question of the selection of delegates toproceed to Holland to represent British interests in the proposed exchange of prisoners of war.It was considered very desirable that Lord Newton and GeneralBelfield, who had been the representatives on the previous occasionand&apos; had intimate knowledge of the subject, should again attend.In view, however, of the widespread interest now taken in thesubject, it was proposed that a Minister with Cabinet rank should proceed as its Head, and that Sir George Cave should be invited toaccept this position.It was also suggested that the delegation should include arepresentative of the Red Cross Society, who might act as anassessor in case of need.After some discussion, Sir George Cave having expressed his willingness to accept the position, the Cabinet decided that Sir George Cave should proceed as Head of the delegation,which should include Lord Newton and general sir Ii. Belfield, and that he should consider whether, and,if so, in what way, representatives of the Red cross society might be utilised.Liquor restriction and Control:Release of &quot;Winesfrom Bond.8. With reference to War Cabinet 267, Minute 2, the WarCabinet had under consideration a memorandum by the Ministryof Food (Paper G.T.-4651), relative to the release of wines frombond.It appeared that the authority issued by the War Cabinet onthe 23rd November, 191&quot;, had not resulted in the release- ofadditional wines, and the Food Controller therefore asked for authority to remove all restrictions on the delivery of wine frombond. It was estimated that such removal would not result in therate of delivery of wine for home consumption exceeding the ratefor 1916.The War Cabinet approved the proposal of&apos; the Food Con-troller.Labour Mission to america.9. Mr: Barnes drew attention to a letter which he had receivedfrom the National Federation of General Workers, in which it wassuggested that he and Mr. 0&apos;Grady should be sent by the WarCabinet to America as members of a Labour Mission to thatcountry. Mr. Barnes said that, in view of telegrams from lord reading, which had expressed the opinion that it might be advisable to limit the number of missions sent from this country, he had askedLord Beaverbrook to obtain Lord Reading&apos;s view as to this proposed mission.It was pointed out that, if such a mission went, it would bedesirable that it should go, on the same understanding as that onwhich the Labour Mission from America recently visited this country.Under that understanding the mission would visit America with the
knowledge and good-will of [the British Government, while notrepresenting it.Mr. Barnes promised to represent these views to the NationalFederation of General Workers.Proposed Extensionof the munitions of War Acts to crown Establish-ments.. 10.
