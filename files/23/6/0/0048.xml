An agreement should not be discussed for theexchange of German submarine prisoners, and that anagreement should not be made for the transport of german prisoners from overseas without consultation with theAdmiralty representative ; and that, if necessary, thisquestion of the transport of German prisoners should bereferred home for further instructions.&quot;Meeting of theSupreme WarCouncil.I. The Appoint-ment of anAdmiralissimo inthe Mediterranean.II. american co-operation.5. The War Cabinet took note of the following resolutions,which were agreed to at the meetings of the Supreme War Councilheld at Versailles on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd June, 1918 : The Supreme War Council had a discussion on the subject ofthe appointment of an Admiralissimo in the Mediterranean. Noconclusion was reached.The Supreme War Council approved the following telegram tobe sent to the President of the United States in the name of thePrime Ministers of France, Italy, and Great Britain :  &quot; We desire to express our warmest thanks to PresidentWilson for the remarkable promptness with which Americanaid, in excess of what at one time seemed practicable, has been rendered to the Allies during the past month to meet a greatemergency. The crisis, however, still continues. General Fochhas presented to us a statement of the utmost gravity, whichpoints out that the numerical superiority of the enemy in France,where 162 Allied divisions are now opposed to 200 german divisions, is very heavy, and that, as there is no possibility ofthe British and French increasing the number of their divisions on the contrary, they are put to extreme straits to keep them up-there is a great danger of the war being lost unless the numerical inferiority of the Allies can be remedied as rapidly as possible by the advent of American troops. He thereforeurges with the utmost insistence that the maximum possible number of infantry and machine-gunners, in which respects theshortage of men on the side of the Allies is most marked, shouldcontinue to be shipped from America in the months of june and July to avert the immediate danger of an Allied defeat inthe present campaign owing to the Allied reserves beingexhausted before those of the enemy. In addition to this, andlooking to the future, he represents that it is impossible to foreseeultimate victory in the war unless America is able to provide

Czech and polish Question.such an army as will enable the Allies ultimately to establishnumerical superiority. He places the total American forcerequired for this at no less than 100 divisions, and urges the continuous raising of fresh American levies, which, in hisopinion, should not be less than 300,000 a month, with a viewto establishing a total American force of 100 divisions at as early a date as this can possibly be done.&quot;We are satisfied that General Foch, who is conductingthe present campaign with consummate ability, and on whosemilitary judgment we continue to place the most absolutereliance, is not overestimating the needs of the case, and we feelconfident that the Government of the United States will do everything that can be done, both to meet the needs of theimmediate situation and to proceed with the continuous raising of fresh Jevies, calculated to provide, as soon as possible, the numerical superiority which the Commander-in-Chief of theAllied armies regards as essential to ultimate victory.&quot;A separate telegram (Appendix) contains the arrange-ment which General Foch, General Pershing, and Lord Milnerhave agreed to recommend to the United States Governmentwdth regard to the despatch of American troops for the monthsof June and July.&quot;The Supreme War Council took note of the fact that an agree-ment had been arrived at on this subject between General Pershingand Lord Milner, and that this agreement had been adhered to bythe French, Italian, and Belgian Governments.The Supreme War Council took note of the agreement reached that morning by the Foreign Ministers of France, Great Britain, andItaly, to approach the Japanese Government on the subject of actionin Siberia ; the common desiderata of the aforesaid Powers being (a.) That  Japan  should  promise  to respect the territorial integrity of Bussia.(b.) That she would take no side in the internal politics of thecountry.(c.) That she would advance as far West, as possible for thepurpose of encountering the Germans.It had been further agreed among the Foreign Ministers that,should Japan consent to intervention on these conditions, an effort should then be made to obtain the assent of the President of theUnited States.The following resolution was agreed upon : In order to expedite  the transport of  Czecho-Slovak troops from Vladivostock to France, as agreed at Abbeville, theSupreme War Council resolve that: (i.) The British Government should ask the japanese to assist with tonnage unless and until requiredfor-an expedition to Vladivostock.(ii.) That the tonnage at present allotted to thetransport of German and Austrian subjects from china to Australia should be diverted to thetransport of Czecho-Slovaks in so far as this canbe done without a dislocation of existing and essential military transport programmes.The following declarations to be made on behalf of theEntente Powers collectively on the subject of : (a.) The Czecho-Slovak and Jugo-Slav peoples,(6.) Poland,agreed to by the Foreign Ministers were noted : &quot; The Allied Governments have noted with pleasure thedeclaration made by the Secretary of State of the United
States Government and desire to associate themselves in an expression of earnest sympathy for the Nationalistic aspirationstowards freedom of the Czecho-Slovak and Jugo-Slav peoples.&quot; The creation of a united and independent Polish state with free access to the sea constitutes one of the conditionsof a solid and just peace, and of the rule of right in Europe.&apos;&apos;It was understood that the Governments separately would beat liberty to supplement these declarations as suitable occasionsarose.VI.

Tanks.The Supreme AVar Council decided that the following declarationshall be published simultaneously in the press of the Allied countries on Wednesday, 5th June : &quot;The Supreme War Council has held its Sixth Sessionunder circumstances of great gravity for the Alliance of freepeoples. The German Government, relieved of all jpressure onits Eastern front by the collapse of the Russian armies and people, has concentrated all its efforts in the AVest. It is now seeking to gain a decision in Europe by a series of desperateand costly assaults upon the Allied armies before the UnitedStates can bring its full strength effectively to bear. Theadvantage it possesses in its strategic position and superiorrailway facilities has enabled the Enemy Command to gainsome initial successes. It will undoubtedly renew the attacks,and the Allied nations may be still exposed to critical days.&quot; After a review of the whole question, the Supreme WarCouncil is convinced that the Allies, bearing the trials of theforthcoming campaign with the same fortitude which they haveever exhibited in the defence of the right, will oaffle the enemypurpose, and, in due course, wall bring him to defeat. Every- -thing possible is being done to sustain and support the armies in the field. The arrangements for unity of command have greatly improved the position of the Allied armies, and are working smoothly and with success. The Supreme War council has complete confidence in General Foch.    It regards with
Prime Ministers 6. (i.) With reference to the previous Minute, Lord Curzon saidStatement. that he had read the notes of the meetings of the Supreme war war Council and that they had left in his mind a rather disagreeableimpression. Although the meetings had ended with agreement,Lord Curzon said that the notes had struck him as being rathersymptomatic of a feeling which might become more serious infuture.The Secretary pointed out that only a part of the notes of the meetings had reached the War Cabinet at present, and that the later meetings were of a more friendly character.Admiralissimo in 6. (ii.) The Prime Minister said that there had certainly been athe Mediterranean, difference of opinion with the Italians on the question of theappointment of an Admiralissimo in the Mediterranean, but expressed the opinion that, if judicious pressure were exercised, theattitude now taken up on this question by the Italian Governmentand the Italian Admiralty would be considerably altered for the better.American 6. (hi.) With regard to the question of American reinforcements,Eeinforcements. Mr. Lloyd George said that the decision which had been arrived atwas a very good one. One of the difficulties at present to be faced in connection with American reinforcements was that the rate atwhich they were pouring into the country was causing grave difficulties in assimilating them. While it was true that com-paratively few Americans were actually in the fighting line at thepresent moment, yet, if a great emergency occurred, there was nodoubt that many thousands now in Prance could be utilised. In thisconnection Mr. Lloyd George said that he had been informed byM. Thomas of the excellent manner in which one American division which had been engaged to the north of Chateau-Thierry hadconducted itself.Open Warfare. 6. (iv.) In speaking of the recent fighting in France, the PrimeMinister said that, from information which he had received, theGermans were apparently adopting a method of open warfarehitherto unknown in Europe. Enemy troops advanced, not inmasses, as had been so often reported, but with a thin screen of machine-guns, followed by small patrols, which took advantage ofall cover available. By these means the French in many cases,while holding villages or other points, had found themselvessuddenly fired upon from the rear, the effect of which was eonse-quently most demoralising, and the result had been that very rapidretreats had taken place without heavy losses to the enemy.Mr. Lloyd George said that the French military authorities hopedthat they would be able to arrest the present advance in three orfour days. As to the direction from which the next attack will come, it was generally thought that this would be in the neighbour-hood of Montdidier.[1365-426] Cpride and admiration the valour of the Allied troops. thanks to the prompt and cordial co-operation of the President of theUnited States, the arrangements which were set on foot morethan two months ago for the transportation and brigading of american troops will make it impossible for the enemy to gaina victory by wearing out the Allied reserves before he hasexhausted his own.&quot; The Supreme War Council are confident of the ultimateresult. The Allied peoples ate resolute not to sacrifice a singleone of the free nations of the world to the despotism of Berlin.Their armies are displaying the same steadfast courage whichhas enabled them on many previous occasions to defeat theGerman onset. They have only to endure with faith and patience to the end to make the victory of freedom secure.The free peoples and their magnificent soldiers will savecivilisation.&quot;
Man-Power: 6. (v.) Mr. Lloyd George discussed at length the various pointsVisit of French which General Foch had brought to the notice of the Supreme WarExpert. Council with reference to the man-power available for the Frenchand British armies, as compared with that of the German army.He said that he had considered it desirable, in view of the state-ments which had been made at the Supreme War Council on thissubject, to invite M. Clemenceau to send a representative to thiscountry, who should have full liberty to study the figures in thisconnection. Mr. Lloyd George said that he did not think that theFrench authorities realised the extremely heavy demands made onthis country with regard to man-power, not only in connection withthe supply of coal, steel, cotton, wool, and other commodities to our allies, but more particularly in connection with the maintenance ofthe British Navy, and all which that entailed in regard to the auxiliary portions of the Fleet. Consequently, Colonel Roure hadbeen deputed by M. Clemenceau to come to England, and all information on this question would be put at his disposal.It was pointed out that, while the Minister of National service had a complete record of all figures available on this question, yetthere were several other Departments which could amplify theinformation which Sir Auckland Geddes could give, and which could show Colonel Roure the very serious demands that were constantlymade on the man-power of this country for other services inconnection with the war than that of the supply of men for the armed forces of the Crown.The War Cabinet requested Mr. Chamberlain to confer with the Minister of NationalService, in order that the information to be given to theFrench representative on the subject of man-power shouldbe as full as possible.Possible diversion of Traffic from london and east coast Ports to west Coast Ports.7. The War Cabinet had under consideration two memoranda by the President of the Board of Trade, on the subject of thepossible diversion of traffic from London and East Coast ports to west Coast ports (Papers G.T.-4606 and G.T.-4606 a).The War Cabinet decided that These memoranda should be remitted to the War priorities committee for consideration and report.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 5, 1918.
An Agreement concluded between General Foch, General Perahing, and Lord Milnerwith reference to the Transportation of American troops in the months of june and July.THE following recommendations are made on the assumption that at least250,000 men can be transported in each of the months of June and July by theemployment of combined British and American tonnage : We recommend (a.) For the month of June :1st. Absolute priority shall be given to the transportation of 170,000combatant troops (viz., six divisions without artillery, ammunition trainsor supply trains amounting to 126,000 men- and 44,000 replacement forcombat troops).2nd. 25,400 men for the service of the railways, of which 13,400 have beenasked for by the French Minister of Transportation.3rd. The balance to be troops of categories to  be  determined by theCommander-in-Chief, American Expeditionary Forces.(b.) For the month of July :1st. Absolute priority for the shipment of 140,000 combatant troops of thenature defined above (four divisions, minus artillery, &amp;o, &amp;o, amountingto 84,000 men, plus 56,000 replacements).2nd. The balance of the 250,000 to consist of troops to be designated by theCommander-in-Chief, American Expeditionary Forces.(c.) It is agreed that if the available tonnage in either month allows of the transportation of a larger number of men than 250,000,. the excess tonnage will beemployed in the transportation of combat troops as defined above.(d.) We recognise that the combatant troops to be despatched in July may haveto include troops which have had insufficient training, but we consider the present emergency is such as to justify a temporary and exceptional departure by the UnitedStates from sound principles of training, especiaUy as a similar course is being followed by France and Great Britain.APPENDIX.
