THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that a-Front- German attack had broken out the previous morning betweenMontdidier and Noyon, on a front of 30 kilom. The front of attack,however, was reduced in the afternoon to 25 kilom. On this part ofthe front the French had 7 divisions in line, 3 in rear, and 3 stillfurther back. Eleven German divisions had been identified, 2of which were picked divisions from Prince Rupprecht&apos;s army,1 being a Guards division and the other the 3rd Jagers. TheGermans had succeeded in penetrating to a depth of 6,000 yards atthe deepest point. The French, however, were satisfied with thesituation, and stated that the losses suffered by the enemy were much heavier than in the previous battle.    The Chief of the
Imperial General Stall&apos; added that 3 German divisions had been moved up to between Bailleul and Kemmel, 1 division being in line and 2 in support.Russia: 2. With reference to War Cabinet 425, Minute 8, the Chief ofThe Caucasus. the Imperial General Staff stated that it was thought that the217th German division had been moved to the Caucasus.Attention was drawn to the fact that this might create a ratherserious situation, and it was suggested that the Eastern Committeeshould consider the matter. It was stated, however, that theattention of the Eastern Committee had already been drawn to thepossible transfer of the 217th German division to the Caucasus, butit was feared that little could be done in the matter.Submarines.3. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that several attacks on enemy submarines had been carried out by aircraft patrols. no definite results, however, had been reported.ZeebruggeBombarded.4. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that our monitors hadbombarded Zeebrugge with satisfactory results. The objectiveshad been the lock gates, the salvage craft, and an assemblage ofvessels round the block-ships. Three enemy destroyers were alsoseen inside the lock, but these left by the canal for Bruges.Air Raids onBrindisi.5. Admiral Hope reported that the enemy had carried out twoair raids on Brindisi on the 9th June. There were forty Italian,but no British casualties. Two machines, with the probability ofa third, were brought down, and two prisoners made.Air Raids onCattaro andDurazzo.Russia.6. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that British machines hadraided Cattaro, and Italian machines had raided Durazzo, on the morning of the 9th June with satisfactory results.7. In reply to a question by Lord Curzon, Admiral Hope statedthat no news had been received from Captain Cromie, at Petrograd.8. In reply to a question regarding the new Handley-Pagemachine which had fallen over GoldeFs Green on the previousSaturday, the Chief of the Air Staff stated that five occupants hadbeen killed, but there was one survivor, Commander Ogilvie. TheChief of the Air Staff said that the cause of the accident was being investigated, but nothing definite was known at present. the machine was climbing steeply, and it is thought that at about1,000 feet three of the engines stopped simultaneously. Enquirieswere being pursued.General Sykes said that another of these machines would beready shortly.   Forty altogether were on order.France &apos; ^  General Sykes stated that there was little increase in thenumber of enemy squadrons in France. The enemy were, however,trying different flying tactics. They now came out in biggerformations, and at different times during the day. Their usualpatrol work over the lines suffered somewhat in consequence.Loss of NewHandlev-PageAeroplane.
Bombing behind the Lines.Aerial Situation in italy and mesopotamia.11. The Chief of the Air Staff said that there was no change inthe aerial situation in Italy or in Mesopotamia, with the exceptionthat there had been an increase in the number of enemy machinesin the Venetian sector.American AircraftPersonnel,12. General Sykes stated that part of the American air personnel, of which there was the equivalent of four squadrons,hitherto training with British squadrons in France, were now being organised into two individual squadrons, and were being given some of our machines in order that they might commence opera-tions. It was hoped that the first of these squadrons would be ready for use on the 20th instant, and the second about a fortnight later.Aircraft in Ireland. 13. With regard  to the three aerial squadrons in Ireland,General Sykes stated that the whole of Ireland, with the exception ofthe western coast, had been divided up into patrol areas. He saidthat he did not know wdiether it was possible to take one or two ofthese squadrons away ; if so, they could be usefully employed inFrance at the present moment.The Prime Minister said that this depended on the number of infantry that could be taken away from Ireland, but he was seeingField-Marshal Lord French that evening, and would talk over thematter with him.General Sykes said that, in view of the difficulties aeroplanesexperienced in the mountainous country in the west of Ireland, smallairships might possibly be more useful for observation work.The Prime Minister said that he would also bring this to thenotice of Lord French.14. Attention was drawn to the fact that there were a great many American gunners for whom no guns could be found atpresent, and that it would be wasteful to turn them into infantry,and it was suggested that these gunners might well be drafted into british heavy-gun batteries which were at the moment short of men.The Secretary of State for War undertook to look into thematter, and to report to the War Cabinet.Economic 15. With reference to War Cabinet 413, Minute 11, Mr. Cham-Offensive berlain said that he had been authorised by the War Cabinet toCommittee. examine Sir Edward Carson&apos;s Report (Paper G.-190) with a view tothe reorganisation of the Economic Offensive Committee. Pie hadbeen impressed by the strong recommendations contained in theReport that the Committee should be reconstructed on a somewhat different basis. The situation had been examined afresh by theCommittee under Mr. Barnes&apos;s chairmanship, with the result that aReport had been circulated (Paper G.-209), which the War Cabinetnow had before them.   The Report recommended (a.) That a Committee of Economic Defence and Developmentbe appointed.American ArtilleryPersonnel.10. The Chief of the Air Staff said that the bombing of ourback areas carried out by the enemy lately had been severe. Wewere endeavouring to counter this by organising the aerial defenceof important towns in the back areas on the same lines as the defences in this country. This would necessitate increased numbersof anti-aircraft guns and searchlights. One squadron for nightfighting was being sent from England to Abbeville as a firstmeasure.
(6.) That&apos; this Committee should be a Cabinet Committee,,consisting of a member of the War Cabinet as Chairman,together with the Minister of Reconstruction, thePresident of the Board of Trade, the Minister of Blockade(who would also represent the Foreign Office), the secretaries of State for the Colonies and India, &quot;theMinister for Labour, and the Financial Secretary to theTreasury.(c.) That the Committee should meet regularly once a week ata fixed hour.(d.) That the Committee should have wide powers to dealwithin their discretion with any economic questions, andshould refer to the War Cabinet only such large questionsof policy as require Cabinet sanction, or questions uponwhich they have been unable to agree.(e.) That the Committee should have the authority to call forreports as to the execution of the measures decided upon.(/.) That the Secretary of the War Cabinet should be instructedto refer to the Committee economic questions before theyare brought to the Cabinet, unless there are special reasons to the contrary, and the Secretary of the Com-mittee should be a member of the War cabinet secretariat, so that the work of the Committee may be properly co-ordinated with the general work of theCabinet.Mr. Chamberlain said that it was only at the last moment thathe had learned of the scope of the enquiries pursued by the ImperialTrade Relations Committee, presided over by Mr. Long. He had previously understood that this Committee, which had been appointedby the Prime Minister a year ago, dealt only with the imperial preference Resolutions of the Imperial War Cabinet. Mr.Chamberlain said that the last thing the Economic Offensive Com-mittee wished to do was to create machinery that would cause freshoverlapping. He felt, however, that there was scope for bothCommittees, and that the line of demarcation between the functionsof the two Committees could be determined by the two Chairmen.It was most important that the two Chairmen should keep in the closest touch, with a view to prevent any overlapping.The Prime Minister said that it would be impossible for theCabinet to define the spheres of work in any Terms of Reference tothe Committee, but if the Chairmen agreed as to division of workand gave one another the benefit of any previous experience that either Committee might have had, the difficulty in regard to over-lapping would be minimised.Mr. Long agreed that duplication of work could be prevented.Moreover, if he were represented by Mr. Hewins on the EconomicCommittee, there would be no danger of his not being kept informed of the work done by that Committee.Mr. Barnes said that, since the retirement, of Sir Edward Carson,he had acted temporarily as Chairman of the Economic Committee.He would like now, however, to vacate the chair in favour ofMr. Chamberlain, but he would wish to remain a member of theCommittee.The War Cabinet, in approving generally the recommendations contained in the Report (Paper G.-209), decided (i.) That the Committee should consist of the following : Mr. Chamberlain (Chairman),Mr. Barnes,The Minister of Reconstruction,The president of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Blockade (who would also representthe Foreign Office),
The Secretary of State for the Colonies,The Secretary of State for India,The Minister of Labour,The Financial Secretary to the Treasury,Sir Alfred Mond,(ii.) That Mr. Chamberlain should consult with the Secretaryof the War Cabinet as to who should he the secretary or Secretaries of the Committee ;(iii.) That it should be left to the discretion of the Chairman ofthe Economic Defence and Development Committee andthe Imperial Trade Relations Committee to define theirspheres of work, and, as far as possible, prevent over-lapping.16. A discussion took place on Government organisation, in thecourse of which the formation of a similar Standing Cabinet Com-mittee of the Interior (or of Home Affairs to consider all questionsof internal policy was suggested. It was further suggested that itshoidd be the duty of the Committee to consider all domesticquestions which required the co-operation of more than one Depart-ment, or were of such importance that they would otherwise call forthe consideration of the War Cabinet. For example, recent instanceshad occurred in the cases of Afforestation, Ministry of Health, and education. The Committee should have a wide discretion indealing finally with questions on which agreement was reached,and should refer to the War Cabinet only such large questions ofpolicy as required Cabinet sanction, or questions on which they hadbeen unable to reach agreement.The Cabinet approved the proposal, but wished it to be quite clear that the proposed Committee of Home Affairs should not beregarded as a second Cabinet.Mr. Balfour also strongly advised against two Cabinets.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) A Standing Cabinet Committee of Home Affairs should beappointed to consider all questions of internal policy;(b.) The Committee should be composed of : The Home Secretary (in the Chair),The President of the Board of Trade,The President of the Local Government Board,The Minister of Reconstruction,President, Board of Education,The Minister of Labour,The Secretary for Scotland, andOne of the Law Officers of the Crown (who might be either  the  Attorney-General  or the   Solicitor-General, as occasion required) ;(c.) The Committee should meet regularly once a week at a fixed hour;(d.) It should be the duty of the Committee to consider alldomestic questions which require the co-operation ofmore than one Department, or of such importance thatthey would otherwise call for the consideration of theCabinet. The Committee should have a wide discretion in dealing finally with questions on which agreement isreached, and should refer to the War Cabinet only such large questions of policy as require Cabinet sanction, orquestions on which they have been unable to reach agreement;(e.) The Secretary to the War Cabinet should have instructionsto refer to the Committee all questions falling within their competence before they are brought to the Cabinet,
unless there are special reasons of urgency which make this course impossible, and that the Secretary of theCommittee should be a member of the War cabinet secretariat ;(/.) The Chairman should have authority to invite the attendance of other Ministers aa occasion might require,and those Ministers should be authorised to seek theassistance of the Committee where they feel the needfor it.     _Pemberton Billing 17. With reference to War Cabinet 425, Minute 17, in regarde&quot; to the Pemberton Billing case, the Chancellor of the Exchequer saidthat he had heard from the Attorney-General to the effect thatthe Law Officers were of opinion that no step could usefully betaken by the Government in relation to the Pemberton Billingmatter. The only possible course would be a Commission ofEnquiry, and the objections to such a course were numerousand manifest.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that perhaps itmight be possible to prosecute some of the witnesses for perjury.The War Cabinet asked The Chancellor of the Exchequer to refer this question aboutperjury to the Attorney-General.Ireland: pg  Tne geeretary of State for the Colonies informed the WarVoluntary Service Cabinet that he had received a letter from Mr. Arthur Lynch, M.P.,Movement. who was coming forward as a zealous and active supporter of the voluntary service movement in Ireland, saying that he thought hewould be able to raise a battalion in Ireland of men who wouldvolunteer for service, and asking for permission to start recruitingat once. He said that the Chief Secretary was in favour of the project, which was, however, opposed by the Viceroy on account ofMr. Lynch&apos;s record in the South African War, when he foughtagainst us, was taken prisoner, and was condemned to be shot as atraitor.It was agreed that Mr. Lynch was now thoroughly imbued withpro-Ally sentiment, that in the South African War he had shownfine soldierly qualities, and that, in the circumstances, his previoushistory should not be allowed to stand in the way of his presentpatriotic offer.At the request of the War Cabinet- Mr. Long undertook to interview Field-Marshal Lord French inthe course of the next twenty-four hours, and to ascertain whether he were not prepared to change his mind, and toreport the result to the War Cabinet prior to the WarOffice being approached on the matter.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,June 10, 1918.
