Telegram to portugal.3. With reference to War Cabinet 389, Minute 6, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff reported that some of the Portuguesebattalions were said to have fought well. In view, however, of the pressure being put by the Portuguese Government for the transportof further troops to France, it was thought advisable that theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs should not send the suggestedtelegram of congratulation.Troops fromMacedonia.4. With reference to War Cabinet 3S8, Minute 4, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff informed, the War Cabinet that he hadreceived a telegram from General Foch with regard to the suggestionthat two divisions should be withdrawn from Salonica.It was pointed out that this question was never referred to the versailles Council for their views, but the War Cabinet merelyrequested the Director of Military Operations to consider the matter.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that he hadalready sent a reply to General Foch, saying that there was noquestion of withdrawing divisions from Salonica.Anti-Aircraft Gyns ^e Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that, owing to for France. the loss of anti-aircraft guns in France, the Master-General of the ordnance had requested that any further guns produced at homemight be sent to France. The Chief of the Imperial General staff said there was no question of taking away anti-aircraft guns already in position in this country, but all he asked was that the production for the moment should be diverted to France.The War Cabinet decided that Subject to the consent of the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, Home Forces, the output of anti-aircraft guns should for the present be sent entirely to France.Casualties.German Casualties.6.

Mr. Bonar Law raised the question as to whether the Houseof Commons should be asked to pass a resolution of thanks to president Wilson for the way in which he had come to the assistanceof the Allies in sending American troops to France.The War Cabinet decided that This was not advisable at present, in view of the rather guardedattitude towards this matter recently displayed by PresidentWilson and the very full statements made by the PrimeMinister and Lord Curzon in Parliament.
WC 390Man-Power Bill:Ministers of religion.9. With reference to War Cabinet 383, Minute 10, the question was raised as to the desirability of extending the Man-Power Bill to ministers of religion. It was stated that strong opinion existedagainst enforcing this Clause in Ireland, and the question arosewhether, if abandoned for Ireland, it should be left out in Englandalso.Mention was made of the precedent of France, but it waspointed out that Franee, as a State, was definitely non-religious,although including great numbers of religious people. It was stated that the general feeling in the House of Commons was prob-ably that, if the Government insisted, they would pass this clause,but many strong supporters of the war would be much distressed.The War Cabinet decided that-This decision should be left in and Sir Auckland Geddes,House.the hands of Sir George Cave&apos;after hearing the views of theMembers ofParliament.10. The question was raised as to whether the Man-Power bill would apply to Members of Parliament.It was pointed out that the exemption of one member of parliament-ment had come up before a Tribunal some time ago, and theTribunal had decided that being a Member of the House of Com-mons constituted work of national importance.It was also stated that Mr. Beck, in the House of Commonsyesterday, replied that Members of Parliament would be exempt from the new Bill.The War Cabinet decided-to adhere to minute 11)their  previous  decision   (War  Cabinet   48,Tribunals forGovernmentOffices.valuable men now engaged in11. With reference to War Cabinet 389, Minute 12 (6), theSecretary of State for War asked the approval of the War Cabinetto a proposal that commissioned officers employed in Governmentoccupations should be taken out of uniform and be made to wearcivilian clothes, in order to prevent the abuse of uniform for thepurpose of evading active service.It was pointed out that manynon-combatant work would refuse to remain in their appointmentsif ordered to wear mufti.After the application of the proposal to several officers knownto the War Cabinet had been discussed, the Secretary said that hisown case was perhaps a case in point. He had been ordered to wearuniform at an early stage in the war, but, unless the War Cabinet,as the body controlling all the British resources engaged in the war,was regarded as a military body, the work he was performing might perhaps be deemed to be civilian work.Lord Derby stated that the Secretary&apos;s case was different fromthose whom he proposed to prohibit from wearing uniform, as he-was a Regular officer, and Lord Derby did not propose to makeofficers who held commissions in the Regulars or the territorial force wear mufti. He maintained that officers coming under thesetwo categories were entitled to wear uniform.The War Cabinet decided that Lord Derby&apos;s suggestion should be held over, pending thereports of* the War Office, the Admiralty, and the RoyalAir Force, of the number of men in uniform engaged in non--combatant services at home and on foreign missions,who were physically sound.1365-390B 2

With reference to War Cabinet 387, Minute 4, the first sea Lord stated that a message had been received from H.M.S.&quot;Suffolk,&quot; that a Russian named Gorsky, with five others, had arrived at Vladivostock from Moscow with orders from the LeninGovernment to spread Bolshevist propaganda among the crews ofPI.M.S. &quot; Suffolk &quot; and U.S.S. &quot; Brooklyn.&quot;H.M.S. &quot;KingAlfred.&quot;11, The First Sea Lord reported that H.M.S. &quot;King Alfred&quot;had been torpedoed on the 11th instant 30 miles from Malin Head,but that the vessel had managed to reach Belfast Lough, badly damaged.The s.s. &quot; Celtic/15. With reference to War Cabinet 379, Minute 1, the first sea Lord said that the steamship &quot; Celtic &quot; had been brought intoharbour.Loss of Italian .16. The First Sea Lord reported that a collision had occurredDestroyer. in the Adriatic between some French, and Italian destroyers, withthe result that an Italian destroyer had been sunk.The MilitarySituation in theEast.Murmansk.17. The War Cabinet had before them the following docu-ments : Memorandum bv General Knox, with covering note by theChief of the&quot;Imperial General Staff (Paper G.T.-4.156).Joint Note No. 20 to the Supreme War Council by its military representatives.Memorandum by General Pooie on British Occupation ofMurmansk, with covering; note by Lord Robert Cecil(Paper G.T.-4200).Minutes of Joint Meeting of the Military Representatives,Supreme &quot;War Council, and the Allied Naval Council, heldat Versailles the 23rd March, 1918 (Paper G.T.-4137.)At the suggestion of the First Lord of the Admiralty, thequestion of Murmansk was dealt with first. He stated that theAdmiralty proposed to send another small cruiser there, and that an american cruiser was about, to sail. What further action should betaken was a question to be decided in principle by the War Cabinet,Lord Robert Cecil explained that the Finns apparently covetedthe port and the adjoining coast, and that there was a threat of movement by the pro-German White Guards against the MurmanRailway. This movement created the emergency against which provision must be made. Should troops under German influenceseize Kem, this would have disagreeable results for us in the WhiteSea.In this connection a telegram from the Senior Naval Officer,Murmansk, was read. It gave an account of the defensive measuresat present possible with the available forces at Murmansk, butindicated that a continuance of the thaw then prevailing wouldinterrupt the Finnish operations. So far, the only definite information, he had was of skirmishes between Finnish Red and white Guards west of Kandalaksha. The port of Murmansk, it waspointed out, was, if it could be assumed that Odessa was lost to GreatRussia, the last ice-free port in her territory, giving access to the
open sea: If we attempted [to save it from the White Guards, wecould reasonably expect the goodwill of the Local as well as of theCentral Soviets. In this respect our action should not be liable tothe construction put on Japanese interference at Vladivostock, andthe case could be treated in isolation from the general military policy to be adopted in the East. Sudden action, however, was to bedeprecated, and Lord Robert Cecil undertook to send beforehand afull explanation of any action, that might be decided on toMr. Lockhart. As a military measure the defence of the approaches to Murmansk offered no great difficulties, and General Poole&apos;smemorandum (Paper G.T.-4200) indicated all that was required.He recommended an immediate landing, however, and this was morethan could at present be consented to.The War Cabinet decided that AM preparations should be made by the Admiralty for theaction recommended in the memorandum, so that the senior Naval Officer at Murmansk should be able to cope with the emergency when it arose, and that, in the mean-time every effort should be made by the Foreign Office toobtain in anticipation the consent of the BolshevikGovernment.Archangel 18. Attention was drawn to Joint Note 20, of the military representatives at Versailles on the subject of a military expeditionto Archangel. Its conclusion was that the minimum requisite force was not available.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff pointed out that thiswas part of the general military problem in the East, which he urged must be regarded as a whole on the lines of his note(Paper G.T.-4156). The main necessity was to get the japanese to move. This, Lord Robert Cecil observed, could not be done without American consent, which did not appear to be forthcoming,save on one condition, i.e., that intervention should be invited bythe Russians themselves. As de facto the Government of russia was Bolshevist, all that we could do at present was to urge M. Trotzkiby ever)&apos; means in our power to see the problem as we saw it, andto help us to its solution. Though there might not be a great hopeof success, no other course was open to us.Attention was drawn to the unsatisfactory state of the Alliedrepresentation in Russia. The question of a British HighCommissioner to co-ordinate the activities of the various Consulatesand Missions was stated to be under consideration in the ForeignOffice.It was further agreed that a full review of the whole case hadnot as yet been placed before the American or the RussianGovernments.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in collaboration withthe Chief of the Imperial General Staff, should draft fortheir consideration a despatch to President Wilson, groupingall the isolated propositions and presenting a generalscheme of policy for dealing with the Eastern situation,with a view to its subsequent presentation to M. Trotzkithrough Mr. Lockhart.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,April 12, 1918.o
