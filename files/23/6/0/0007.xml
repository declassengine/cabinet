2The Prime Minister said: I thought before assembling Parliament it would bewell to summon the Ministers in charge of Departments, and who in peace time wouldordinarily form the Cabinet, to hear what the War Cabinet means to submit to Parlia-ment, and to have the views of our colleagues on these proposals before we come to final conclusions upon them.Ministers know generally what has happened in France. There is a good dealwhich is not yet known as to the cause of the disaster in the initial stages of the greatbattle. Roughly speaking what happened was this: the Germans attacked theBritish army on a front of 50 miles the biggest attack yet made. They attacked with gigantic forces, drawn, not only from their lines on the West, but from reservesaccumulated from Russia and Italy. When the battle began the numbers of bothsides were approximately equal with a slight superiority of the Allies over the wholeline, a superior rifle strength of, perhaps, 100,000 on the whole front. With theAllies in this estimate are included some 48,000 Americans; the Belgians and portuguese-guese. If we leave these out then the British and French were approximately equalto the Germans. In guns we had a slight superiority. During the past two years theGerman forces were roughly in the proportion of 2 to our 3. At the point of theactual attack, the Germans were in overwhelming superiority. Probably when theyattacked the Vth Army, they were between 2 and 3 to our 1. The offensive hasalways an advantage, and that is why in the initial stage of a battle the defendingarmy is driven back.When we were at Versailles in January last, we were advised that an attack would be made on us south of Arras with German forces of 95 divisions. This was a remarkable forecast, and the proposal made was to form a reserve of 30 divisions to counter the blow. There was a good deal of division of opinion as to where the blowwould come.The French and British Generals had come to the conclusion that there might bea three-fold attack, viz., at Cambrai, Champagne, and Verdun, and had made dis-positions accordingly. There was nothing in the German preparations against thistheory. Our reserves having been kept by us in readiness for this three-fold attack,there was considerable delay in bringing up the French reserves; in fact, after the attack General Petain still believed that the Germans intended a big attack inChampagne, and he therefore kept back reserves there which ought to have beenbrought up. These reserves are now up, but there is a great difference between 3 days and a fortnight. By this delay the Germans gained enormously, and they gainedalso from the fact that there was not complete unity of command. Field-MarshalFfaig was convinced that the full force of the attack was falling on him, general petain was not--hence the great bulge in our line.General Foch had agreed with Sir Henry Wilson that the attack would be madeat this point with 95 divisions. The forecast was justified. When the attack camethe Germans were favoured by the weather. It was dryunder foot and misty over-head, with the result that the Germans were in overwhelming numbers within 50yards of our trenches before our men knew they were there at all. The Germans gotin between our lines. There was great confusion. I cannot tell you what happened,nor can General Wilson tell me nor Field-Marshal Flaig. I went over to France tofind out, and came back knowing little more than when I went. It is, perhaps, almostinevitable: no one General can overlook a whole army. The telephone lines were cut,and there was widespread chaos. A great many things require explanation, e.g.,whether the br-idges over the Somme were destroyed, whether and why the germans were allowed to cross the Somme without opposition. We should have held the lineof the Somme for some time till reinforcements came up. It was unfortunate thatGeneral Gough was in command of the Vth Army, in spite of the representations ofSir William Robertson and Sir Henry Wilson. The Government have since taken theresponsibility of recalling him. I think Ministers ought to know these things.Ultimately Lord Milner went over to Conrpiegne, and subsequently to a Conference atDoullens on the 26th March to represent the War Cabinet. Up to that hour general petain still believed an attack would take place in Champagne. He changed his mindsometime between Monday and Tuesday (25th and 26th March), but between the pre-vious Thursday and Tuesday there had been the loss of vital time. It was decided at.the Conference, with the full consent of the Generals, that General Foch should beappointed to co-ordinate the efforts of both armies. The fact that we were two armiesand not one meant that on a vital part of the line Somme to Moreuil it was not clear for days who was in command of it. That shows what lack of unity has meant to us.   A shod deal of this is, perhaps, inevitable when two armies are fighting
together. No doubt the Germans and Austrians suffered from a lack of unity on theEastern front, and the Russians took full advantage of it. I hope, at least, that the evil has been cured on our front. The Vth Army has practically disappeared. Thereare only some remnants of it still in the line.Mr. Churchill: There is a lot of salvage being rescued.The Prime Minister: As an army it has disappeared. Out of 13 divisions only  are in the line, the others are being refitted. That severe loss is one rea,son for thegreat demand for man-power which we must put forward. It is very difficult to know the extent of our losses. According to Field-Marshal Haig, they have been 130,000,including casualties of all kinds. That figure is quite incompatible with the Germanstory. I understood, when in France, that between 80,000 and 90,000 had passed through our casualty clearing stations; that would leave only between 30,000 and40,000 to be accounted for, and that would include the dead and the wounded in thehands of the Germans. Such figures are quite incompatible with the German claim of 90,000 prisoners, unless the French had lost 60,000, which they have not. either the Germans are inventing these losses or we have not yet heard the full toll of our casualties. We are, at any rate, confronted with a serious man-power problem. Theexperience of the last two or three years shows that our casualties are between 70,000and 80,000 a month. It looks as if we should have to make up in two or three weekslosses, which under previous conditions would have allowed us two or three months.We are sending to France all the men we possibly can to repair the broken divi-sions. When the battle began there were between 80,000 and 90,000 men on leave inthis country. We had to send them back together with fresh drafts. Under normalconditions, before this battle, we sent across the Channel even- day some 6,000 or7,000 men; since the battle we have sent up to as many as 32.000 on a single day. Upto the 4th April we had carried 190,000.Mr. Herbert Fisher: Have any of our transport been attacked by submarines&apos;?The Prune Minister: Not a single transport has been lost; the work of the navyhas been splendid. Ministers will remember we gave a pledge that only in a grave emergency would we send overseas boys under 19. We feel the emergency has arisen,and have decided to send boys of 18-J to France.There has been considerable dekry in recruiting miners and engineers, and inspite of the Local Government Board&apos;s faith in tribunals, appeals mean delay andthe first thing the 50,000 miners released for military service have done is to putin applications to tribunals. To meet the drain on the pool we have to do two things.(1) To call up more men they cannot possibly mature before August and September,the best perhaps will be ready in August, and we have to get through until August.I believe the Germans mean to fight this battle right through to victory or defeat.It is going to be a battle not of weeks but of months. The nation with the largest number of reserves to throw in when the other is exhausted is likely to be victoriousunless there is some unforeseen military disaster. We have to bridge the chasmbetween now and August. The drain on our reservoir of men will be beyond any-thing ever anticipated. (2) We must draw on America, I do not know to what extent the facts ought to be told to the House of Commons. The Americans had undertaken to have 17  divisions in France by March; she had in fact 4 divisionswith 2 displacement divisions for draft. When the battle began she had one division in the line. An American division is 13,000 as against 10,000 British (includingthe pioneer battalion). The failure of the Americans to come up to time had aserious effect on the plans of the Allies. These plans, it is true, were based not onthe complete fulfilment of the American promise, but we did think that the americans would have had from 10 to 12 divisions ready at the crucial time. The first thingwe did was to apeal to General Pershing and Mr. Baker to put 4 divisions into theline. They are now in one of them in the fighting line. I am told thev have fought well. There is no prospect of further divisions being ready foi this battle.The Americans have called up a million men. - We appealed to President Wilson,through Lord Reading, to send us 300,000 infantry, and offered to provide halfthe transport if they were sent at the rate of 120,000 a month. We told the president that this decisive battle might be over without the American Army being in it. Wehave heard from Lord Reading that President Wilson has agreed to send over120,000 men per month in April, May, June, and July, making 480,000 in all Thismeans that he will call up another half a million men. A good many of these havebeen trained for months, and may be put into the line in a fortnight after their
arrival. It is the fashion of professional soldiers to look down on colonial soldiersand territorials and on these Americans, but I am convinced that these citizensoldiers from the States will clo well.(At this stage Lord Derby read the communique of the press which had just been received from General Headquarters.)Sir A. Stanley: Do you think these American soldiers will really arrive?The Prime Minister: I think so. I have asked Lord Reading to step&apos; outsidehis ambassadorial functions and to satisfy himself that every possible step is being-taken to fulfil the Presidents pledge. I believe the American public is nowthoroughly awake to the situation, and the American press is asking questions. Weare sending one of our- best transport experts from the Ministry of Shipping to new york and also an officer from the Adjutant-General&apos;s Department.We can only have these Americans on the understanding that they are lent tous. They cannot be permanently incorporated into our army. General Pershingcan take them out and form American divisions. We cannot therefore bank on them,and when General Pershing takes them out we shall have to fill the gaps. TheAmerican, drafts will be exhausted by August because the fighting will be heavy and continuous. We ought, therefore, to be ready&apos; to put our men in then so as to holdon until the winter or until the Germans say they have had enough I decline to contemplate the other contingency.Sir Maurice Hankey reminds me that we have lost heavily in guns 950 guns.Mr. Churchill: Only 60 of them heavy.The Prime Minister: But we have lost many medium guns and many howitzers.The Ministry of Munitions went into this matter at once and reported that notmerety could we replace the lost guns, but we could replace them twice over, and asto ammunition we had a very7 adequate supply7.Mr. Churchill: One very good firm has doubled its output since the battlebegan.The Prime Minister: We must raise hundreds of thousands of men more than we contemplated, because we cannot take any risks in this matter. . I know it isa very serious thing to do, because we have already gone to very great lengths. Itis clear that certain industries must not be touched. Shipbuilding must on no account be interfered with it must remain in the foremost position amongprotected industries, for without more ships neither we nor our Allies can carry onthe war.Sir George Cave has presided over a Committee which has framed a series ofman-power proposals, and.the Bill embodydng these will be circulated to ministers immediately copies are received from the printer. &apos;1 come now to a highly controversial question which has caused great perplexity7to the Cabinet the question whether conscription should be extended to Ireland.No doubt if you do extend it there will be trouble, perhaps bloodshed. We may7 havethe same experience as Sir Robert Borden in Quebec, but that is not conclusive. i will state the considerations which have weighed with me in coming to a decision.Even if Home Rule were carried to-morrow, the army and navy7 would be underthe control of the Imperial Parliament. The claim has never been put forward by any Irish party  that the army and navy and the defence of the Realm are localmatters. In the second place, I do not believe it possible in this country to tearindustry about, to break up single businesses, to take fathers of 45 and up wards fromtheir homes to fight the battles of a Catholic nationality on the Continent withoutdeep resentment at the spectacle of sturdy young Catholics in Ireland spending their time in increasing the difficulties of this country by7 drilling and by compelling usto keep troops in Ireland. I do not know any grounds of justice or equity on whichconscription could not be applied to Ireland... I cannot think of any Liberal doctrineand I do not think there is any Unionist doctrine which would justify the applicationof conscription to this country and not to Ireland. We have, shown indulgence toIreland, perhaps wise and reasonable indulgence, in the hope that Ireland wouldbecome reconciled to her Imperial associations. We have now decided that wecannot apply7 these drastic, far-reaching, and devastating proposals to England,Scotland, and Wales without applying conscription to Ireland, where there is not even a rationing system.   We cannot go to the House of Commons and ask our
people to make sacrifices, sacrifices which the Irish in America are making, and leave the Irish at home out.. I think we ought to accord to Ireland the same rights as Irishmen are enjoying in America. Whether it is right or wrong during the war to touch Home Rule is another question. The late and the present Government took the other view, and I think they were right. No one thought when the pledge notto touch Home Rule was given that the war would last four years. We set up aConvention. The Convention have agreed to a Report by a majority of 44 to 29.It is a remarkable result. Catholic Bishops and Ulstermen and Sinn-Feiners aretogether in the minority, while moderate Nationalists and Southern Unionists aretogether in a majority with Anglican Bishops. It is a very moderate Report. the sinn-Fein demand is for the control of Customs, otherwise they would have agreed with the majority, and so would the Catholic Bishops.Mr. Churchill: But they would have found some other grievance then.The Prime Minister: We agreed that we could not concede the control of Customs,because if later on a federal system were set up for the United Kingdom we couldnot have separate Customs barriers between the four countries. The whole tendency of the age is against the multiplication of Customs barriers. This I pointed out tothe Bishop of Raphoe, when he urged that no self-respecting nation could hold up its head without the control of Customs. I quoted the example of Bavaria, whichhas an army and a king, but no Customs, and so with Saxony and Wiirtemberg.Lord Robert Cecil: And Luxemburg.The-Prime Minister: I cannot help thinking that the Ulster position at the Con-vention was this: they would not commit themselves definitely to anything, because etheir experience has been that, when they have assented to anything, it has alwaysbeen made the basis for fresh and bigger demand upon them. If I am right in mydiagnosis, I think it means that, subject to the safeguards laid down in the letter of the  War Cabinet to Sir Horace Plunkett, they will be prepared to accept the Con-vention Report, In that letter the.question of Customs is postponed until after thewar, and the Imperial Parliament of that day would be asked to adjudicateupon it in the light of the circumstances then obtaining. I do notbelieve that the Imperial Parliament will concede separate Customs. The IrishNationalist Party has accepted a method of election which secures a strong minority in the Irish Parliament, chosen largely on a property basis, and I think the nationalists have agreed to this because they fear to hand over the government oftheir country to the wilder elements in Ireland.Our proposal is to bring in a Conscription Bill, which will include Ireland, but which will provide for the application of conscription to Ireland by Order inCouncil. We propose to bring in simultaneously our Home Rule Bill, put it through Parliament, and then immediately apply the Military Service Act.American troops are coming in. We shall then have to draw on British drafts inthe first instance. If you do not introduce conscription until the Home Rule Billis through, then the Irish will resist Home Rule. We must not give them thatincentive to reject Home Rule, It will take time to put conscription into force inIreland. We have not the machinery; we shall have to improvise a register, withthe aid of the police. There is no reason why the preparation of the necessary machinery should be delayed. (In reply to Lord Robert Cecil.) We will not undertake to postpone the application of conscription until the Home Rule Bill isthrough.Lord Curzon: We must stand or fall by both.Mr. Bonar Law: How would you justify to the House of Commons delayingconscription? You can say, as the Prime Minister has just said, that time isrequired for machinery, but it must be made plain that the two Bills are notcontingent.1 Lord Robert Cecil: You will have to say the postponement is in connection&apos; with home Rule.The Prime Minister: I would say it will take time, and that time we mean touse to put through the Home Rule Bill.Lord Robert Cecil: You will have to indicate that both will have to be workedtogether.1365-385 -
Lord Milner: It is our intention to proceed with conscription even if the home rule Bill is generally opposed.Dr. Addisoii: We can say, &quot; You are getting the right of self-government, you must do your share to defend your liberties.&quot;Mr. Bonar Law: Suppose we start with trying to force both Bills through, andthen find that Members of all kinds are opposed to the Home Rule Bill, how can youpossibly carry it through?The Prime Minister: It is not necessary to decide that to-day. Why should we on Tuesday anticipate that the Irish will refuse Home Rule, when we have justhad the Report of the Convention? It-is absurd to decide what we can do beforethe crisis arises.Mr. Churchill: The two measures should be regarded as independent, and besimultaneously introduced. I do not see the advantage of delaying the applicationof the Military Service Act to Ireland. The dual policy should be loyally followed.I would press forward on the two roads. There is a great deal to be said against any delay in action once conscription is announced.Mr. Barnes: You have in the Bill a clause which would deal with the sinn feiners who are now drilling. That can be applied at once, j cannot assent toapply conscription willy-nilly without any guarantee of Home Rule. I shall haveto reserve the right to reconsider the position later.Lord Robert Cecil: I do not know what the Cabinefs scheme of Home Rule is.Many of my Unionist colleagues are in the same position. I am anxious to getconscription through in Ireland, and am prepared to pay a high prioe to obtainmen in. this emergency.The Prime Minister: I can only say, in a general way, that our scheme will proceed on the lines of the Cabinet letter, with safeguards for Ulster in the shape of an Ulster Committee.(The Secretary was instructed to circulate to Ministers a copy of the Cabinet&apos;&apos;sletter to Sir Horace Plunkett.)Mr. Bonar Law: You do not ask your colleagues to commit themselves to-day to the form of the Home Rule Bill.The Prime Minister: That would be hardly fair.Mr. Herbert Fisher: Has not the Government given a pledge to proceed if therewas substantial agreement at the Convention?The Prime Minister: I do not think you can say that 44 to 29 is substantial agreement. We are now going on the other line: that, failing substantial agree-ment, the Government will produce a Bill, and in that Bill we must make provisionfor Ulster.Mr. Bonar Law: It is absurd to ask Ministers to commit themselves now.Mr. Churchill: That is a hard saying. The enforcing of conscription on ireland is a rupturing of political associations, and involves a complete new orientation ofantagonisms, and therefore it is folly not to see how grave that decision is. I couldnot agree to that unless our Unionist friends come with us on the other measure,which profoundly affects opinion here, in Ireland, and in the United States. It ishard that we should commit ourselves to conscription unless we can count on cordialagreement among our Unionist colleagues that they will go forward in support ofHome Ride with equal energy.hr. Addison expressed concurrence with what Mr. Churchill had said.The Prime Minister: That is the policy of the Government.   The Cabinet haveagreed to a definite plan.Mr. Bonar Law: But the letter gives no definite plan.The Prime Minister: Unless we follow the lines of the Cabinet letter and theCabinet agreement, then I cannot put forward conscription for Ireland on Tuesday.Mr. Bondr Law: It depends upon the form in which the principles of the letterare put in the Bill.
Lord Curzon: We have accepted the broad principles of the letter, and our colleagues are entitled to see the letter.Mr. Bonar Law: It must depend upon whether the Bill carries out the principlesof the letter.The Prime Minister: That is a different matter.Lord Milner: I am prepared to accept such a Home Rule Bill as conformsgenerally to the proposals put forward in the Prime Ministers letter to the Con-vention. It is very hard for us to support such a Bill if Ulster opposes it, but Iam prepared to do that and to put forward every effort in support of the home rule Bill, but I am not prepared to abandon conscription even if we completely failwith the Home Rule Bill.Mr. Barnes: Why not put both in one basket? I am voting for conscriptionbecause I am thereby hoping to get Home Rule. If not, I shall have to reconsidermy position.Lord Robert Cecil: If I vote for Home Rule it is because I hope thereby to getconscription.Mr. Barnes: If we fail, we can go to the country.The Prime Minister: We could not do that.   The Government can go if wefail.Lord Derby: We must stake our existence on passing both Bills.Mr. Herbert Fisher: Are you definitely satisfied that there is a militaryadvantage in applying conscription to Ireland? I feel absolutely with you as to the bad effect on English public opinion of continuing to exempt Ireland; but we should look at it as a cold military proposition. English public opinion is sound. Ourartisans will do their duty. You have to decide whether it is worth your while to enforce conscription in Ireland and thereby perhaps obtain disaffected elementsfor your army.Lord Derby: They will be distributed through the army.The Prime Minister: That is the one consideration that chiefly worried me.Is it worth while, in a military sense? You will get 50,000, at any rate, at aminimum, who will fight. These five divisions will be made up of excellentmaterial, of young men up to 25, at a time when we are taking old men.Mr. Churchill: I have not met one soldier in France who does not think weshall get good fighting material from Ireland. I think the decision of the WarCabinet is a battlefield decision, but a wise one.2, Whitehall Gardens, S. W. 1.April 6, 1918.o
