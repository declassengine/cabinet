G.T.-4621. APPENDIX.     -(Revised.) -Statement in regard to Irish Arrests.THE revolutionary movement in Ireland, which culminated in the arrest of aconsiderable number of persons last week, consisted of two closely related series of activities  (a.) The attempts of the German Government to foment rebellion in Ireland ; and(b.) The preparations made in Ireland to carry those attempts into action.The story of the active connection between the leaders of the Sinn Fein movement and the Germans, as disclosed by documents in the possession of the BritishGovernment, falls into two parts: the period prior to, and the period since, theabortive Ii-ish rebellion of Easter 1916. The events of the first period can be toldwith some &quot;detail,&quot; but the second period, which concerns recents events, permits ofno more than a &quot; summary,&quot; as a full statement &quot; of the facts and documents inpossession of the Government &quot; would disclose the names of persons who stood by theGovernment, and also the channels of communication through which the GermanGovernment was acting, and which it would not be in the public interest to reveal atpresent.I.The story begins as early in the Avar as the 6th November, 191-1, whenHerr Zimmermann transmitted through Count Bernsdorff a message from Casementasking that a messenger, if possible a native-born American, be sent to Ireland Aviththe Avord that everything Avas favourable. He Avas to carry no letter, for fear of arrest.Casement also asked that an Irish priest should be sent to Germany Avith the assistanceof the German Legation in Norway to Avork in prison camps and corrupt Irishprisoners, of Avar. This priest Avas a certain Father John T. Nicholson, an Americancitizen of Irish birth. He reached Germany safely, and we find him in January 1915transmitting messages to America. According to a report of Captain von Papen datedthe 5th December, 1914, the verbal assurances sent in response to Casement&apos;s requesthad produced an excellent impression in Ireland.In the beginning of 1916 the plot ripened. On the 10th February of that yearCount Bernsdorff sent to a covering address in Rotterdam a despatch signed with thename of Skal, one of his principal American agents. This despatch included an extract from a report of John Devoy, the head of the Clan-na-Gael, to the effect that action in Ireland could not be postponed much longer, since he feared the arrest of theleaders. It had been decided, he said, to begin action on Easter Saturday, and he urged that the arms and munitions must be in Limerick by that date. Later in thesame month Count Bernsdorff, following his usual practice, surreptitiously attachedto a message to Berlin, passed by the American Government, a note fixing EasterSaturday for the rising and urging the despatch of munitions in time.On the 4th March von Jagow replied that the arms would be landed in TraleeBay, and&apos; asked that the necessary arrangements should be made in Ireland throughDevoy. On the 14th March Bernsdorff replied that the Irish agreed, and that full details were being sent, to Ireland by messenger. Next day Bernsdorff telegraphed a code to be used between the Germans and the rebels while the arms Avere in transit,and explained that a submarine might safely enter Dublin Bay and go as far as thePigeon House without encountering nets.On the 26th March von Jagow replied that the arms would be sent and that aspecial code word Avould be used eA-ery night as an introduction to the german wireless Press Service. In a message from Bernsdorff to Berlin the Germans Avereassured that there Avere numerous private wireless receiving stations in Ireland.On the 18th and 19th April urgent messages were sent from America to Berlin,fixing the delivery of the arms for the evening of Easter Sunday, pressing for the landing of German troops, and asking for an air raid on England and a naval attackon the English coast. These attacks actually took place between the 24th and26th April. It was the declared hope of the rebels and their German and Americanfriends to blockade the Irish ports against England, and establish bases in ireland for German submarines.
The rebellion broke out a day later than the schedule on Easter Monday, the24th April; but, as the world is aware, the German support had miscarried, and itended in complete failure.The Report of the Royal Commission on the Rebellion in Ireland stated : &quot;It isnow a matter of common notoriety that the Irish Volunteers have been in communica-tion with the authorities in Germany and were for a long time known to be supplied by money through Irish-American societies. This was so stated in public byMr. John McNeill on the 8th November, 1914. It was suspected long before theoutbreak that some of the money came from German sources.&quot; The evidence on thissubject in the possession of the British Government provides the clearest proof ofthese suspicions.II.It became clear very soon after the rising that, the Sinn Fein leaders were againasking Germany:for help. On the 17th June there was a message from Berlin to washington referring to &quot; A259 of the 6th May&quot; (a message which is missing),and saying that Germany was perfectly ready to give further help if the Irish would only say what sort of help they required. On the 16th June Bernsdorff had already sent a despatch giving an. account of the rebellion as far as his information went, and stating that 1,000L had been provided for the, defence of Casement. On the 25th Julyhe sent a long message giving further news from Ireland and explaining that thework of reorganising the rebels was making good progress and that. their lack ofmoney had been remedied by him.On the 8th September, in a despatch to Berlin, he enclosed a memorandum froma person called &quot; Irish Revolution Director Resident in America,&quot; which containeddetailed proposals for a fresh rising. Any rising, says the Irish Revolution Director,must be contingent upon the sending by Germany of &quot;an expedition with a sufficientmilitary force to cover the landing.&quot; On this- new occasion the German Governmentwas to fix the time, and, as an inducement, the advantage of having submarine andZeppelin bases in the: West of Ireland was insisted&apos; upon.Count Bernsdorff was evidently having difficulty with his tools, for s on the24th October, he warned his Government not to allow a certain Captain Boehm, thenresident in Rotterdam, to write to Irishmen in America, since his letters were apt togo to the wrong people.   Later Captain Boehm was arrested by us in British waters.On the 4th December we find Count Bernsdorff again attaching surreptitiously anote to a message passed by,the American Government, in which he mentioned thatthe Irish leaders in America were pressing for an answer to their proposal of the8th September. He seems to have followed this on Christmas Day with a message which is missing, for, on the last day of 1916, Herr Zimmermann informed him of the quantities of munitions which it was proposed to land between the 21st and25th February, 1917. He added that it was impossible to send German troops. Onthe 18th January, 1917, Bernsdorff replied that his Irish Committee declined theproposal, as, without German troops, a rising would be useless.After Anierica&apos;s entrance into the AVar on the 4th April, 1917, the line ofcommunication between the German&apos; Government and the leaders of the Sinn Fein party was temporarily broken, though there is no reason to believe that the messengerservice devised by John Devoy between America and Ireland was affected. &quot; A clue tothe new line of communication was subsequently obtained and has been actively followed up. The effect of this new line in Ireland &quot; is &quot; visible in the speeches of the SinnFein leaders during this period. For example, de A^alera, addressing the convention of Irish Volunteers on the 27th October, 1917, said : &quot; &apos; By proper organisation, recruiting, they could have 500,000 fightingvolunteers in Ireland. That would be a big army, but without the opportunity and the means of fighting, it could only be used as a menace. There had alreadybeen too much bloodshed without success, and he Avould never advocate anotherrebellion without hopeful chances of success. They could see no hope of that inthe near future, except through a German invasion of England, and the landing of troops and munitions in Ireland. They should be prepared to leave nothingundone towards that end.&apos;.*&apos; On. another occasion in January, this year, de Valera said : , &quot; &apos; So long as Germany is the enemy of England and England the enemy ofIreland, so long will Ireland be the friend of Germany.&apos; &quot;
For some considerable time it was difficult to obtain accurate information as tothe German-Sinn Fein plans, but about April 1918 it was definitely ascertained thatthe plan for landing arms in Ireland was ripe for execution, and that the Germans onlyawaited definite information from Ireland as to the time, place, and date. The british authorities were able to warn the Irish Command regarding the probable landing of an agent from Germany from a submarine. The agent actually landed on the .12th April,and was arrested. The new rising depended largely upon the landing of munitionsfrom submarines, and there is evidence to show that it was planned to follow a success-ful German offensive in the. West and to take place at a time when Great britain would be presumably stripped of troops.&apos;&apos; According to documents found on hisperson, cle Valera had worked out in great detail the constitution of his rebel army,and hoped to be able to muster 500,000 trained men. There is evidence that Germanmumitions were actually shipped on submarines at Cuxhaven at the beginning of May,and that for some time German submarines had been busy off the west coast of ireland on other errands than the destruction of Allied shipping.It Avill thus be seen that negotiations between the executive of the Siun Feinorganisation and Germany have beeu virtually continuous for three and a half years.At first a section of the Irish-Americans was the intermediary for most of thediscussions, but since America&apos;s entrance into the War communications with the enemyhave tended to be more direct. A second rising in Ireland was planned for last year,and the scheme broke down only because Germany was unable to send troops. Thisyear, plans for another rising &quot; in connection with the German offensive on theWestern front&quot; were &quot;maturing&quot; and a new shipment of arms from Germany was imminent. An important feature in every plan was the establishment of submarinebases in Ireland to menace the shipping of all nations. In these circumstances, noother course was open to the Government, if useless bloodshed was to be avoided, andits duty to the Abies fulfilled, but to intern the &quot;authors and abettors&quot; of thiscriminal intrigue.o
