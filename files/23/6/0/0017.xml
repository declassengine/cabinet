Transport Positionin France.Coal for France.Food for the civilian Populationof the North ofFrance.The Supply ofFrench Troops inthe Northern Area.1. WITH reference to War Cabinet 394, Minute 4, the PrimeMinister informed the War Cabinet that on the previous evening he had held a meeting with the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff, the Quartermaster-General, Sir Sam Fay, General TraversClarke, General Nash, and Sir Joseph Maclay, to go into the ques-tion of coal for France, and he wished the War Cabinet to confirmcertain decisions he had arrived at with regard to that and othermatters connected with it (Paper G.T.-4273). The Prime minister  explained that 600,000 tons of coal per month from the Bruaymines were normally sent to parts of France south of the Somme,and that the transport of this coal greatly hampered the move-. rnent of British and French troops over the railways. The PrimeMinister pointed out that, if the British. Government could supply the greater part of this coal, and so close down the Brnay mines,the railway system in this part of France would be relieved.froma great strain, and the transport of troops made correspondinglyeasier. He stated that the possibility always existed of thesemines having to be closed down owing to German bombardment.General Nash, whose remarks are elaborated in greater detail ina memorandum which he handed in (Paper G.T.-4282), then ex-plained to the War Cabinet what would be the result ofsuch a decision. He stated that, as the result of investigation, ithad been ascertained that the Minister of Shipping was able toprovide the necessary tonnage, and that the Coal Controller could provide immediately 300,000 tons of coal per month, and that within the next month he could increase this amount to 400,000tons. This 400,000 tons of coal could be provided without theminers&apos; comb-out being affected, but any amount required above this would affect the comb-out. Should it become necessary tosupply the French with 700,000 tons a month, which the minescould do by June of this year, the first comb-out of 50,000 minerswould not be affected, but in the comb-out next May of a further50,000 the Coal Controller would have to retain half the number ofmen that were being called up, and he would also have to insist that no voluntary enlistment should be allowed. It was found inpractice that when a man was called up by ballot it often happenedthat one or two of his friends would voluntarily enlist.The War Cabinet agreed that it was important that the totalnumber of men obtained from the mines, whether by compulsory or voluntary enlistment, should not exceed the agreed quota.The War Cabinet thereupon ratified, the following decisionsgiven on the previous evening by the Prime Minister on behalf ofthe War Cabinet: (a.) It was of vital military importance to stop the transportof coal from the Bruay mines to the South of France,and that the only safe assumption on which to base our plans was that no coal would be forthcoming from theBrnay area. The Coal Controller and the ShippingController, in concert, should do their utmost to supplyand transport the minimum amount of coal requiredby the French south of the Somme.(6.) Subject to Lord Milner not having already arranged thematter, the War Cabinet would approach the FrenchGovernment with a view to releasing the southern linesof railway by placing the necessary foodstuffs for civilian purposes in the area north of the Somme by sea.(c.) The supply of all troops operating north of the linoEtaples St. Pol should be undertaken by the british army.The question then arose as to who should make the necessarynegotiations with the French, and General Nash expressed his willingness to do so.
The Western Front 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that yester-chxy had been a good day for us. The enemy had attacked nearGivenchy with certainly six, and perhaps seven, divisions. Hehad made absolutely no impression on our front, and we had cle-feateci the attack with three divisions only. Near Kemmel theenemy had attacked with one or two divisions, and had also failedto make an impression. The Chief of the Imperial General staff stated that the German divisions that took part in the attack yes-terday were not poor in quality; on the contrary, two of the divisions were considered to be on a level with some of the best theGermans had in France. He stated that the Germans had 21divisions in reserve between Arras and Lille, and had a further 33divisions which they could use in a roulement. As against these,the British possessed yesterday 6 divisions, and the French 60,counting the roulement. General Wilson added that the germans had lost .2,000 prisoners in the fighting yesterday evening.Message from HisMajesty the king to the Troops.3. A suggestion was made that the present would be an appropriate time for&apos;the King to send a message of encouragement to the troops in France. Such a message might refer to thenumber of German divisions which had been engaged in the fight-ing, and the splendid resistance of our troops in beating off attacks in which they had been outnumbered by about three to one. Men-tion should also be made of the assistance rendered by the French.The opinion was expressed, however, that perhaps the time hadnot yet arrived for such a message to be sent, and that it might beas well to await further developments of the battle in France.In the meantime the War Cabinet decided that In the first instance the Chief of the Imperial General staff should draft a telegram for the consideration of thePrime Minister.On the understanding that the Minister of Shipping and theCoal Controller were agreeable, and with such technical assistance as the Minister of Shipping and the Coal Controller considered desirable, the War Cabinet requested General Nash to negotiate the following arrangements withthe French Government: (a.) At once to press the French to shut down absolutelythe coal traffic from the Pas-de-Calais mines.(b.) To come to an agreement with the French regardingthe quantity of coal to be exported from theUnited Kingdom to France in the event of the Pas-de-Calais mines being put out of action. Thisagreement to take into account the better quality of the coal to be supplied from the United King-department&apos;s.(c.) To come to an agreement with the French as towhether the full quantity required can be dis-charged at French ports, and, if so, at what ports,and how much at each.The War Cabinet also decided that The Minister of Shipping should ascertain definitely for whatquantity of coal shipping from the United States toFrance could be found after the first fortnight.
Co-operation of theUnited States ofAmerica.March of UnitedStates troops through London.4. Attention was drawn to the small number of men whichcould be used for fighting purposes which were now included inthe troops coming over from the United States of America. Itwas stated that since the new arrangement had been made with president Wilson 23,000 United States troops had arrived in thiscountry, and there were a further 20,000 on the sea. Out of this total of 43,000 only 12,000 would be available for use as battalions in the British Army.The suggesion was made that either General Foch or GeneralBliss should make representations to President Wilson on thesubject. It. was pointed out, however, that General Bliss hadalready clone his utmost in the matter, and thought that if he tookfurther action it might result in more harm than good.Attention was also drawn to the fact that the United StatesGovernment were only raising 150,000 recruits a month, whereasit had been stated that they had 10,000,000 men available betweenthe ages of 20 and 30. If recruiting proceeded at this slow rateof progress the United States army in France next year would notbe of such a size as to give the Allies a decisive superior^ of force.The Chief of the Imperial Generad Staff stated that GeneralsBridges and ITutchinson had been instructed, whilst in America,to draw the attention of the United States Authorities to thispoint.5. A proposal was made that a march of United States troops through London would have an excellent effect both in this countryand in the United States, and on the troops themselves.The War Cabinet agreed to this suggestion, and the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff undertook to make the neces-sary arrangements.Vladivostock.Submarines.Russia:Archangel,6. The First Sea, Lord reported that the Chinese cruiser &quot; HaiYung &quot; had arrived at Vladivostock on the 17th April. A mes-sage from IT.M.S. &quot; Suffolk &quot; had been received to the effect thatthe Allied Consuls had sent a joint note to the local authorities andthe press, explaining that the landing was purely a police measure and not hostile to any section of the population, and that the land-ing party would be withdrawn as soon as satisfactory measures for safeguarding Allied property existed.7. The First Sea Lord reported that an enemy submarine hadbeen sunk in the minefield off Dover on the previous evening.8. With reference to War Cabinet 393, Minute 18, the WarCabinet had under consideration the situation at Archangel, as setout in a Memorandum by the First Sea Lord of the Admiralty(Paper G.T.-4259).Mr. Baltour drew attention to his telegram No. 87, of the 18thinstant, to Mr. Lockhart, relative to the removal of stores fromArchangel to Vologda, and stated that since that telegram hadbeen despatched he had received information, through the RussianSupply Committee, to the effect that, instead of stores beingremoved, the contrary was the case, and articles such as flax, &amp;c,were being sent towards Archangel; consequently, until accurate information was received, a true grasp of the situation prevailingthere was not possible.As regards the points raised by the Admiralty, the WarCabinet approved (a.) The.despatch of a cruiser to Archangel to protect Alliedinterests.
Japanese 9. With reference to War Cabinet 386, Minute 9, the PrimeIntervention. Minister drew the attention of the War Cabinet to a telegram, No.94, of the 13th April, 1918. from Mr. Lockhart, which indicated that M. Trotzki wishes the Allied Governments to submit to him,at the earliest opportunity, a full and proper statement of help which they could furnish to enable Russia to carry on the war against Germany, and of the guarantees the Allies are prepared togive in this direction. M. Trotzki had added that, if the condi-tions are friendly, he considers the conclusion of the agreementboth necessary and desirable. This request, coming from M.Trotzki, indicated a change in his views, and, taken in conjunctionwith other requests, such as that of assistance in reorganising the black Sea Fleet (War Cabinet 393, Minute 19), pointed to his desire for Allied support. The Prime Minister expressed the viewthat our past appeals to the United States were capable of theconstruction that we wished to impose our assistance on the Bol-sheviks, but we now had an opportunity to make a new appeal to president Wilson, based on M. Trotzki&apos;s invitation. The PrimeMinister stated that he had had a draft prepared summarising the suggestions that had been made in the past with regard to thenature of Allied intervention, and he suggested that this draft,giving definite proposals, should be brought up to date by including in it any further points that might be mentioned in Mr. Lockharfstelegram No. 94, and, after consideration by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, despatched to President Wilson (see telegramNo. 2303, of the 19th April, to Lord Reading). If the latteragrees to our proposals and guarantees, they should be forwarded to M. Trotzki for his consideration.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that, in hisopinion, if the approval of the President was obtained, it would benecessary to consult the Japanese to see if they would carry out their share of the proposals as to intervention. He mentioned,however, that, with a view to saving time, it would not be necessaryto wait for the reply from the Italian and French Governments,as he was sure that they would heartily welcome any form of allied intervention which aimed at an advance against Germany andGerman influence in Western. Siberia.It was suggested that, since telegrams take five days to reachRussia, it would be advisable to send Mr. Lockhart a copy of the telegram to President Wilson, in order that, in the event of the presidents support being obtained, no time might be lost inmaking representations to M. Trotzki. Mr. Balfour stated thatthis would be done automatically.The War Cabinet approved the  proposal of the  PrimeMinister.The Budget. 10- The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave a full explanation of his Budget proposals, including details of taxation.After some discussion, these were  approved by the WarCabinet.[1365-395]C(&amp;.) That the captain should not be authorised to prevent by force the railing away of the Allied stores from Arch-angel.(c.) That the captain should, however, in other respects, begiven wide discretionary powers to deal with anysituation that may suddenly arise, without previous reference to the Admiralty if time does not admit.
Greek Mobilisation. 11, With reference to War Cabinet 393, Minute 22, the WarCabinet took note of the decisions arrived at by General Smutswith regard to the Mobilisation of Greece (Paper G.T.-4255)(Appendix).12. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMilitary Service Minister of National Service, covering a draft of a ProclamationAct (2) 1918. which it was proposed to issue under the Military Service (No. 2)Act, 1918 (Paper G.T.-4264), a revised draft of the Proclamation(Paper G.T.-4264a), and a Memorandum on Man-Power and munitions, by Mr. Churchill (Paper G.T.-4270).The general object of the Proclamation was to withdrawCertificates of Exemption from men who have attained, or willattain, the ages of 19, 20, 21, 22, or 23, during the present year,and who are, or are found to be, Grade I or Grade II, subject tocertain exceptions. It was proposed, concurrently with the Pro-clamation, to issue an Order cancelling all Protection Certificatesgranted to men of Grade I employed in munitions under theschedule of protected occupations, with certain exceptions. Thetemporary postponement of the recruiting of port labour from the ports of Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow, and Bristol, was to becontinued. Railways were not mentioned in the exceptions, as itwas proposed to continue the arrangement for dealing with themadministratively.Sir Auckland Geddes explained that the proposal was toensure a &quot; clean cut &quot; by age through every walk of life except inthose occupations where the &quot; clean cut &quot; ha,d already taken place.The most serious effect of the present Proclamation would be uponagriculture, where 16,000 in Grade I would be called up. Theeffect on munition workers would be slight. The remainder of themen would be obtained from the Civil Service, the Post Office, and,in diminishing numbers, from the smaller occupations all over thecountry. Applications for exemption or postponement, withinthe limits laid down in the Proclamation, would be heardhy tribunals locally. It must be understood that the issue ofthe present Proclamation was but the first application of thepower, granted by Clause 3 of the new Act, to cancel exemptionoin the- case of a national emergency. He was aiming, for example,at the moment, for 16,000 men from agriculture, but eventually itwas hoped to obtain up to at least 25,000 from that industry.Sir Arthur Lee objected that neither the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries nor the Food Production Department had been given  an opportunity of discussing these proposals with the Minister ofNational Service before their submission to the War Cabinet. Theproposals as set forth were calculated to produce the maximum o rfriction and injury to agriculture. If the Board of Agriculturewere asked by the WTar Cabinet to produce a certain number ofmen, they would do their best to furnish them by means of themachinery that was already in operation.Mr. Prothero questioned whether it was worth while to callup 63,000 men engaged in agriculture before the tribunals inorder to obtain 16,000 soldiers. The amount of friction and loss oftime involved by that process would be enormous, and it wouldhave a very damaging effect on the country districts. His Depart-ment would be prepared to do its utmost to find the required men,and, if it failed, the Ministry of National Service could then step in. Plis Department, working through the War agricultural committees, had the necessary experience which would enablethem to obtain the men with least damage to the manning of the farms, and they would not need to waste the time of 47,000 agri-culturists at the tribunals. He failed to see why agriculture couldnot be dealt with administratively, after the manner of the rail-ways. The County Committees would deeply resent being super -superseded by tribunals composed of residents drawn from urban areas
unfamiliar with, the needs of the farming community. Further, he hoped the Minister of National Service would make his demands upon the farmers as definite as possible, as they had to make their plans a long period in advance. He impressed upon the WarCabinet that the present proposals, if carried out, were boundseriously to affect food production, as the Department was atpresent short of 30,000 men required for carrying out its programme.Sir Auckland Ceddes wished to emphasise most strongly thatthe principle which the Proclamation sought to enforce was notapplicable to agriculture only, but affected the whole of the recruit-ing effort of the next few months. In order to secure the properpsychological effect on the country, and to obtain the large number or men required, it was necessary for the Government to use the drastic powers now available in order to sweep in the young menwho had hitherto been protected. It was similarly necessary toproduce the right atmosphere in the tribunals,&quot;in order thatexemption might be granted only in very exceptional circumstances.Mr. Churchill said that, under the Proclamation, it was hoped to obtain 3,200 men from munitions. He wished to remind theCabinet that there had been a very great acceleration in the rate at which men were being released from munitions during the last few months. From the 1st January to the 12th April, 49,000 had gone, and in the last five weeks the weekly rate had grown from,600 to nearly 9,000. He was not opposed to the policy of the&quot; clean cut,&quot; but he objected to it being applied suddenly, and,unless time were allowed for dilution and substitution, serious embarrassment would be caused. Fie was prepared to accept the revised Draft Order proposed by Sir Auckland Geddes, providedthat the necessary exemptions were allowed, and he was willing that such exemptions should be reviewed by a committee composedof a representative of each of the three Department concerned,namely, the Ministry of Munitions, the Ministry of NationalService, and the War Office.Sir Alan Anderson stated that the number of 12,500 expected from Admiralty A firms was the absolute maximum which couldbe given up. This number had already been agreed to with theWar Cabinet (War Cabinet 379, Minute 9). &quot;Of that number,2,500 had already been surrendered, and the difficult)- had beennot in releasing men. so much as in obtaining substitutes for them.He considered it very important that men engaged in, and familiar with, the industry should decide who could be spared.Sir Hubert Llewellyn Smith stated that the Board of trade were, on the whole, content with the proposed procedure, but theywould have been glad if the railwaymen could have been mentionedin the Proclamation, with the coal miners, but a footnote or anannouncement in the press would suffice. With regard to portlabour, Swansea and Ardrossan should be mentioned in additionto those named in the covering note (Paper G.TS-^264).Sir Joseph Maclay said it was essential to postpone calling up port labour from all ports of the Kingdom. On other points hewas satisfied with the proposed arrangements.Mr. Illingworfh said he was prepared to accept the scheme ofSir Auckland Geddes. Orders had been issued to release all fitpostal employees, except those in Ireland, under 25 for the army,with a very few exceptions, and he had intimated to leading repre-sentatives of the business community that they must be preparedto put up with some inconvenience in the Postal Service in conse-quence.The Secretary reported that the Ministry of Food were satis-fied with the arrangements which they had concluded with theMinistry of National Service for safeguarding the food-distribute-ing indiastries.
Sir James Dodds said that in Scotland also the effect of thepresent proposals on the food production programme might be serious. The Board of Agriculture for Scotland and the RegionalDirector of National Service worked in close co-operation inobtaining recruits from the land, and he hoped that that method would be allowed to continue.Mr. Hayes Fisher called attention to the widespread com-plaint which reached the Local Government Board, to the effectthat some farmers&apos; sons and other agricultural workers were beingunfairly shielded by the War Agricultural Committees.In reply, Mr. Prothero pointed out that the War ExecutiveCommittees could only shield the farmers&apos; sons who had beenexempted by the tribunals in the twelve months before the Com-mittee received their powers.The Prime Minister said that the War Cabinet had fully realised that their man-power programme could not be enforcedwithout considerable industrial dislocation. They had to make a&quot; clean cut&quot; in industries which were already suffering from ascarcity of workmen. The men must be got for the army, and gotas speedily as possible. He was surprised to find that the tribunalsin Sir Auckland Geddes&apos; scheme were allowed to function at allwhere the &apos;: clean cut &apos;&apos; was operative. He understood that thiswas proposed in order to meet, more particularly, certain casesi ofa very exceptional character the young men on the land but thatthe Board of Agriculture objected to the use of local tribunals.He suggested that the situation might be met as follows: the&quot;clean cut&quot; to be enforced without an appeal to the localtribunals: the War Agricultural Committees to examine caseswhere a farmer maintains that the &quot; clean cut &quot; would destroy his business; these cases should then be negotiated by the Ministry ofNational Service and the Board of Agriculture, and, in the eventof the final decision supporting the appeal, the man would be released from the army.The War Cabinet decided -To approve the proposals of the Minister of National Service,and the issue of the revised Proclamation, subject to thefollowing modifications: (a.) The War Agricultural Committees to sift excep-tional cases, and to refer only suitable cases to theCounty Appeal Tribunal without use of the localtribunal. The Scottish Board of Agriculture toarrange to use the Appeal Tribunals in similarvital cases.(5.) The War Cabinet considered that it was essentialthat all Certificates of Protection granted toGrade I men of the ages specified in the Proclama-tion and employed in munitions industries, shouldbe withdrawn as nearly as possible concurrently with the recruitment of men called up under the proclamation. They accordingly ordered theAdmiralty, the Ministry of Munitions, the WarOffice, Contracts Department, that, with theexception of men in an occupation for which an age limit of 19 is fixed in the schedule of occupa-tions, no Grade I man to be retained after thefollowing dates: (a.) Men born in 1898 and 1899 after the 17thMav.(&amp;.) Men &quot;born in 1895, 1896, or 1897 after the17th June.The Cabinet further instructed the Deparfc-ments that every effort must be made to expedite the release of such men for service before the datesspecified, and that arrangements must be made for
Ireland: 13. The W ar Cabinet had under consideration a memorandumInternment of Sinn by the home Secretary, on the subject of the internment of SinnFein Leaders. Pein leaders (Paper G.T.-4267).Sir George Cave pointed out that the War Cabinet had decided that the Military authorities in Ireland should be allowedto deport to England certain persons who were engaged inseditious practices in Ireland, under the Defence of the RealmRegulation No. 14 (War Cabinet 354, Minute 8), but that this order only gave power to remove such persons to England, andthat it would be practically impossible to control them while at large. His present proposal was to give power to intern such persons either in Ireland or in Great Britain, but to do so it wasnecessary that Section 14b of the Defence of the Realm Regula-tions should be amended. Dnder this Section, persons arrestedcould be interned if &quot;hostile associations &quot; could be proved, as inthe case of the Easter Rebellion of 1916 in Dublin, but at the pre-sent moment it was doubtful whether connection with the enemycould be proved in the case of most of the Sinn Fein leaders. sir george Cave pointed out that this alteration would only apply in areas where trial by jury had been suspended.Mr. Barnes expressed the opinion that the present moment was an unfortunate one in which to take this action. There was apparently no active hostility in Ireland, and he feared that thepublication of this amendment to the Defence of the realm regulations would inflame public opinion in Ireland, as it wouldbe evident that the alterations proposed were intended to apply toIreland only. In view of the fact that, according to the reports which he had seen in the press, the Sinn Feiners and Nationalistswere now advising their people not to break the law., he strongly expressed the opinion that this action would be most inadvisable.The Prime Minister said that, according to his information,the opinion of the people in Ireland was already as inflamed as it[1365-395] Da prompt medical examination of all men withinthe above ages, so as to ensure that the examina-tion of men born in 1898 and 1899 should be com-pleted at least 7 days before the 17th May, andthe examinations of men born in 1895, 1896, and1897, at least 14 days before the 17th June.(c.) A discretionary power to remain with the LabourDepartment of the Ministry of Munitions, and the shipyard Labour Department of the Admiralty,as to the retention in Munition or Admiraltywork of men of the ages affected by the proposedWar Cabinet Order, the discretionary power to besubject to the review of a committee composed ofrepresentatives, in the former case of the Ministryof National Service, the War Office, and theMinistry of Munitions; and, in the latter, repre-sentatives of the Ministry of National Service, theWar Office, and the Admiralty.(d.) The question of allowing professional advocates to appear before tribunals to be settled by theMinister of National Service and the President ofthe Local Government Board.(e.) The total number to be called up from Admiralty Afirms to be approximately 12,500 men.(/.) A reference to be made to the case of the railway-men by means of a footnote to the Proclamation,or by a press announcement.(g.) The temporary postponement of the recruiting of port labour to apply to all the ports of the UnitedKingdom.
was possible to be. He proceeded to read a personal letter whichhe had. just received from Field-Marshal Lord French, which dealtwith the plans which Lord French, in co-operation with the Fleadof the Royal Irish Constabulary, was making in view of thenecessity of enforcing conscription with the assistance of themilitary, should such necessity arise for dealing with any strikesor- rebellious outbreaks. Mr. Lloyd George said that Lord Frenchdesired to stay in Ireland for another ten days, if it were eon-venient, and that, in the circumstances, he had informed him thatit was advisable that he should do so. Mr. Lloyd George also readletters from Mr. Long and the Commander-in-Chief in Ireland,which dealt with the present situation. Sir Bryan Mahon had stated that he was certain that armed resistance was intended ifit was decided to enforce Military Service Act in Ireland, and that,while events were moving rapidly, he did not consider that any alteration was necessary in the number of troops which he hadformerly stated he would require. Taking into consideration allthe present circumstances, the Prime Minister was strongly ofopinion that the amendment as suggested should be adopted, a view which was supported by Mr. Duke.The War Cabinet decided that Regulation 14b should be amended as follows : (a.) In the first paragraph after the words &quot;in suchplace &quot; there shall be inserted the words &quot; in theBritish Islands.&quot;(b.) In the fourth paragraph after the words &quot; deportation-tion of aliens&apos;&apos; there shall be inserted the words&apos;&quot;&apos; or any committee specially appointed by theSecretary of State for the purposes of this regulation.&quot;(c.) After the fourth paragraph (ending with the words&quot;high judicial office &quot;) the following paragraph shall be inserted: &quot; In any area in respect of which the opera-tion of section one of the Defence of the Realm(Amendment) Act, 1915, is for the time being sus-pended, this regulation shall apply in relation toany person who is suspected of acting or havingacted or of being about to act in a manner pre-judicial to the public safety or the defence of the realm, as it applies in relation to persons of hostile origin or association.&quot;(d.) In the fifth paragraph after the word &quot; Scotland &quot;where it firstly occurs there shall be inserted thewords &quot; and Ireland,&quot; and after the word &quot;Scot-land &quot; where it secondly occurs there shall beinserted the words &quot; and the Chief Secretaryrespectively.&quot;(Mr. Barnes wished his dissent from this decision to beplaced on record.)2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.April 20, 1918.
APPENDIX.G.T.-4255. _(Revised.)MOBILISATION  OF  GREECE.Note by General Smuts.BY Minute 16 of War Cabinet 393 I was requested to settle the question of theprovision of supplies for the mobilisation of the Greek Army, as specified in paper g.T.-4241 by General Callwell.After hearing the Departments concerned I made the following ruling :  (1.) It is very essential that three Greek divisions be mobilised as soon as pos-sible, in addition to the four already in the war zone, especially in viewof the importance of reducing the number of British divisions at Salonikaand replacing them by Greek troops.(2.) The supplies specified under items (a), (b), and (c) of the above paper should be furnished by the War Office, so far as resources are available,for the requirements of seven divisions of the Greek Army, with adequatedepots and reserves; if any further mobilisation took place before theautumn special sanction should be obtained for further supplies. these supplies should only be provided for the Greek divisions in the war zone,and as regards meat the Greek troops should be fed from our supplies salonika; our resources in meat, bacon, &amp;c, being proportionatelyincreased to enable us to meet the Greek requirements.Owing to shortage of refrigerated tonnage, meat will probably haveto be in the form of tinned meat or bacon.(3.) The extra tonnage for the above purpose should be provided by the ShippingController.(4.) As regards sugar and coffee, these commodities should be obtained by theGreek Government in Egypt or from Asia, through the French.(5.)
