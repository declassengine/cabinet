The Invasion ofItaly.1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that therehad been stiff fighting on the north of the Italian front, but that theGermans had made no progress. Information had been receivedfrom a captured German aeroplane to the effect that an attack hadbeen planned for the 14th November, which was to have resulted inthe crossing of the Piave. An attack had been made about thatdate, hut the Piave had not been crossed in the manner planned.Transfer of german divisions.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that teo more German divisions had been transferred fromRussia to the Western front, bringing the total to five divisions in thelast three weeks, and that possibly one German division was being transferred from Galicia to the Salonica front. He added that,owing to the present state of affairs in Russia, we were being verybadly served in the matter of information as regards German unitson that front.The Western Front.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that Sir Douglas Haig had followed up his success by pushingon to the village of Fontaine-Notre-Dame. There was no further newsbeyond &quot;this, but this brought our troops within 2 miles of themain road leading north-west from Cambrai, upon which the troopsin the German salient immediately north of our break-through largelydepended for their supplies. He added that in addition to the two british cavalry divisions which had gone into the gap, a Frenchdivision and a cavalry division were being detrained at Peronne tohelp. The success, in his opinion, was due not only to the specialemployment of a large force of Tanks, but also to the fact that theGerman line on this sector had been considerably thinned to enabletroops to be transferred to Flanders, where thereconcentration of enemy reserves.was alarge&quot;Joy Bells.&quot;4. In connection wdth this success, the notice of the WarCabinet was drawn, to a press suggestion that &quot; Joy Bells&quot; shouldbe rung. The War Cabinet were of opinion that, while! people could not be forbidden to demonstrate their satisfaction, no officialencouragement should be given tp the ringing of &quot; Joy Bells.&quot;Palestine.5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that, accordingto the latest telegrams, the position had not changed, adding that progress was, no doubt, slow in the difficult ground over which general Allenby&apos;s advanced troops were now operating. Reportsshowed that probably some 12,000 German troops especiallyselected for service in Mesopotamia or Palestine were now at or south of Aleppo.With regard to the decision taken on the previous day (WarCabinet 279, Minute 19) as to withholding an announcement of the capture of Jerusalem until the Prime Minister could make such anannouncement in the House of Commons, and combine it with astatement as to the steps taken for the protection of the holy places, the War Cabinet decided that This decision should only apply if the House were actually in session ; but that, if &apos;the news of the fall of Jerusalemarrived after 5 p.m. on Friday, and before the following monday, it should be issued to the press in the usual way.Eussia.6. With reference to War Cabinet 279, Minute 16, the WarCabinet discussed how far it was possible for the Allies to take any effective action in Russia against the Bolsheviks, who had now issued
a wireless message to the world announcing that they were determined on an immediate armistice. It was pointed out that theAllied Governments had not so far recognised Lenin and his associates as a Russian Government, and could not recognise as an allied Government in Russia any Government which officially putforward to the enemy proposals for peace. The difficulty was thatany overt official step taken against the Bolsheviks might onlystrengthen their determination to make peace, and might be used toinflame anti-Allied feeling in Russia, and so defeat the very objectwe were aiming at. Nor was anything known of the actual position which would justify us, at this juncture, in backing either Kaledinor any other leader of the party of law and order. It was suggestedthat steps should be taken to build up in Russia some sort of unofficial organisation which could counter the work of the Germanorganisatian. Meanwhile, the best immediate step might be to let the Roumanians get into touch with General Kaledin, on purely military grounds, assuming, of course, that be was in a sufficiently strong position to help them.7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported that thePrime Minister and himself had had a discussion with colonel house on the previous afternoon and had drafted a telegram,subsequently communicated to M. Gambon, stating that a separate peace was not to be thought of, and suggesting that the Roumaniansshould get into touch with General Kaledin (telegram No. 461 toBucharest).It was urged that for the Roumanians to appeal to GeneralKaledin on purely military grounds, as the Commander of the nearest effective Russian Army, would not constitute an intervention in Russian internal affairs to the same extent as an appeal toGeneral Kaledin from the Western Allies direct, while it might atthe same time afford an opportunity for ascertaining what GeneralKaledin&apos;s real strength and intentions were.The War Cabinet were of opinion that this would be apreferable course to the sending of envoys to General Kaledin,either in the shape of a military representative, such as GeneralBallard, or any civilian. In the latter case it Avas urged, moreover,that the difficulties of getting to Southern Russia from this countryAvere at this moment very serious.The War Cabinet instructed The Chief of the Imperial General Staff to send a telegram toGeneral Ballard, putting frankly before him the wholedifficulty of the internal situation in Russia, and asking him, after consultation with the Head of the french military Mission, General Berthelot, to advise as to thebest procedure for approaching General Kaledin, or other-wise securing Russian help for Roumania.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at the same timeundertook to discuss the matter fully with M. Cambon.8. With reference to War Cabinet 279, Minute 3, the PrimeMinister and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reported tothe War Cabinet that Colonel House was resolutely opposed to theissuing of any Proclamation announcing that German East Africawould not be returned to the Germans at the end of the war. Allthe arguments bearing on the shortening of the duration of the campaign in East Africa, Avith all its hardships involved for theAvhite troops and suffering for the population, as Avell as the lockingup of shipping, had not been able to Aveigh Avith him as against the inconvenience such a declaration Avould cause to President Wilson.This applied no less, in Colonel House&apos;s opinion, to a merely
negative Proclamation saying that the country was not to be givenback to the Germans than to a positive one stating that we meant to retain it. Colonel House was not opposed to our keeping thecountry eventually, and thought it was in our interest not to tie our hands publicly at this moment. *The Secretary of State for the Colonies referred to the menace to the peace of the world which would result from the creation of agreat black conscripted Army in Africa -a menace in which theUnited States could not but be interested.It was suggested that, as far as the fears of the native popula-tion were concerned, it might be possible to reassure them without making any public statement which would tie the hands of theGovernment or embarrass our Allies, and that this was a matter which might be left within the discretion of the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies.The War Cabinet, while recognising that their decision mightprolong this difficult and exhausting campaign, felt there was no alternative, in view of Colonel House&apos;s attitude, but to decide that (a.) No announcement as to our war aims regarding EastAfrica should be made at present;(6.) No peace conditions short of absolute surrender could begranted to the German forces in East Africa;(c.) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should send a replyto General van Deventer in  the  sense  of  the  above decisions.Paris Conference. 9. With reference to the British representation at the paris conference, the War Cabinet decided that The British Government should be represented by the PrimeMinister and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Amember of the Cabinet should, in addition, accompany thePrime Minister to Paris for the meeting of the supreme war Council.Canada. 10. The Secretary of State for the Colonies drew the attentionof the War Cabinet to a telegram dated 7th November, 1917, fromthe Canadian Government asking &apos;whether Canada was to be repre-sented at this Conference. He reminded the War Cabinet that atthe beginning of the war a definite promise had been made to theDominion Government that they were to be consulted on questionsbearing on the conduct of the war and terms of peace, and that thismatter had been raised more than once at the time of the meetingsof the Imperial War Cabinet.The War Cabinet were unanimous in considering that a well-considered reply would have to be given, as the matter was one ofgreat importance and raised issues of principle affecting the wholerelations of the dominions to the British Government. It was generally felt that the actual attendance of Dominion representatives at such a Conference was undesirable unless they came as british representatives, as had been, the case with Mr. Hughes at the timeof the Paris Economic Conference. On the other hand, it was realised that non-attendance at these Conferences made previous consultation with the Dominions all the more necessary, and it wasstiggested that in addition to the telegraphic consultation it might bepossible on such occasions to summon any Dominion representatives who might be in this country. In this connection it was pointedout that the Prime Minister of Newfoundland was actually here,and that the new Canadian Minister of Overseas Military Forces,Sir E. Kemp, would be arriving in a few days&apos; time; vvhileMr. Blondin, the Canadian Postmaster-General, was also due in afew days from a visit to France.   On the other hand, it was pointed
WC 280out by the Secretary of State for the Colonies that, while there wasno objection to securing the attendance of Dominion cabinet ministers, so long as they are duly authorised to represent their governments, there were serious objections to bringing the high commissioners into such consultations, both because this wouldinvolve a departure from constitutional precedent and invest themwith a position in the relations between the British and DominionGovernments which they had not hitherto held, and becausepersonally some of them did not enjoy the confidence of their governments, at any rate on matters of such political importance.The Secretary of State for the Colonies reminded the War Cabinetthat the question of fixing the date for the next meeting of theimperial Cabinet and Imperial Conference was imminentj and suggested that it would considerably facilitate his reply if, inaddition to suggesting the attendance at the War Cabinet of representative Ministers who might be in England, he could makeit clear to the Dominions that we were contemplating an early meeting of the Imperial Cabinet and Conference.It was pointed out that the actual Conference with regard towhich the question had been raised was not really one of greatconsequence, more particularly since the creation of the supreme war Council, and that to that extent the Canadian request was dueto a misunderstanding. In making this clear to the canadian government it would be necessary, however, to put this in such away that the Canadian Government might not let this be knownpublicly for election purposes, as this might prejudice our relationswith the Allies The Secretary of State for the Colonies undertook, at the requestof the War Cabinet, to draft a reply, pointing out theactual situation with regard to the forthcoming paris conference, making it clear that the British War cabinet would welcome consultation with any representativeDominion Ministers who might be in this countrv, and atthe same time asking their views as to the date of themeeting of the next Imperial Cabinet and ImperialConference.Soldiers&apos; and 11. The War Cabinet had before them the Second InterimSailors&apos; Pay. Report of the Committee on Soldiers&apos; and Sailors&apos; pay  (paper g.-172).Sir Edward Carson, the Chairman of the Committee, explainedthat two criticisms had been passed on the First Interim Report(Paper G.-154) by a deputation which waited on the Prime Minister.It was urged that the minimum rate for the private soldier should be is. Qd. instead of Is., and proficiency pay should be granted auto-matically and only withheld in cases where a man was definitelycertified as inefficient. In consequence of these representations thePrime Minister had referred ,the First Report back for furtherconsideration. The Committee had endeavoured to meet the criticisms put forward, and now recommended the scheme marked&quot; E &quot; in th.e report, or, if the War Cabinet thought the financial commitments of the country would permit it, the more expensivescheme marked &quot; B.&quot; The former would cost nearly 15,00O,00OZ., thelatter just over 3(),000,000i. for the army and navy. Scheme &quot; E &quot;had the advantage of doing something to reduce the present adverse balance against the fighting man. On the other hand, it withdrewthe concession already announced of ad. a day (Class II) proficiencypay after six months, which would be an unpopular step.Scheme &quot; B &quot; gave a clear advance of Qd.Mr. Forster pointed out that it was only comparatively fewsoldiers, having the necessary-y service, who did not now receiveClass II proficiency pay.   The higher proficiency pay. would continueto be granted, after a test, as at present.[1365-280] C
Dr. Macnamara urged, as an objection to Scheme &quot; E,&quot; that theGovernment was frequently condemned for giving with one handand taking away with the other, and that this would be interpreted as a fresh example of that practice. Dr. Macnamara added that thedecisions of the War Cabinet, based on the First Report, and announced by the Prime Minister, had been put into force by theAdmiralty, and that they would have to be merged in those takento-day. It would be important to make clear that the decisions were to be operative for this War only. The Committee thoughtScheme &quot; B &quot; the best, if the country could afford it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while, like hiscolleagues, he was most anxious to do all possible for the soldiersand jailors, especially for the men in the posts of greatest dangerand discomfort, he was bound to call attention to the country&apos;financial situation, and to the considerable sums already voted asseparation allowances and pensions. There would also be a further report from the present Committee recommending increase toofficers.The War Cabinet decided To adopt Scheme &quot; E &quot; of the Report, and requested Mr. bonar law to announce the decision in the House of Commonsearly next week.Position of Non- 12. Mr.  Forster  called  attention  to  the position  of  non-Combatant Units.1 combatant units, and asked whether the increase decided on abovewas to be extended to them. Under the Regulations they were not qualified for proficiency pay, and if the scheme were strictlyinterpreted they would not receive the increase. They are specialunits composed of conscientious objectors. If they were granted the increase they would be receiving a relatively greater benefitthan the fighting men.. It  was  explained that  the numbers  involved were a few thousand, and that the question was mainly a political one.   Togrant it would tend to increase the trouble about proficiency payreferred to in Minute  11.    To refuse it was difficult to justify,because in effect a new basic rate pf Is 6d. was now being set up.The War Cabinet decided by a majority that The increase be not granted to the non-combatant units.The Irish 13. Mr. Duke stated that he regretted that he was compelled toConvention. inform the War Cabinet that a breakdown in the Irish Conventionappeared imminent. The situation might be summarisd as follows:A Sub-Committee of nine, containing representatives of Nationalists,the Southern Unionists, and of Korth-East Ulster, had beenappointed by the Convention for the purpose of endeavouring tofind a common ground both as regards the constitution of theproposed Irish Chambers and a fiscal settlement. He gathered that, as far as the constitution of the Chambers was concerned,. there were signs of a possible agreement on lines securing tothe minority an equilibrium of votes in a Joint Session of thetwo Houses. On the other hand, with regard to finance, animpasse had been reached. An agreement between the Unionistsin the south and west and the Nationalists on this point seemed possible, but the representatives of North-East Ulster found themselves unable to accept any of the proposals hitherto putforward. He gathered that the main proposal upon which thedisagreement became evident was a proposal to secure fiscal autonomy to the Irish Parliament on colonial lines, subject to anarrangement with regard to customs, against which any Irishcontribution to Imperial funds should be charged. The difficultylay in deciding upon whom would rest the onus of refusing to
continue negotiations, and, as far as he could gather, the onusseemed likely to fall upon the representatives of North-East Ulster.Quite apart from the questions at issue, he would like to have some idea of the Government policy in the event of a breakdown of theConvention, but, before that, he suggested that pressure from outsidemight be brought to bear upon members of the Convention by a communication to the effect that it was the earnest wish of theGovernment that all possible means of accommodation should bediscussed before a breakdown were announced, and that, in theevent of a breakdown, the Government should declare its determina-tion to take the matter up anew at the earliest possible moment, andto carry on the discussion of the questions at issue from the pointalready reached by the Convention. He felt very strongly that, ifthe Convention broke down, the Irish question could not be allowedto drift, and that there would be serious trouble in the coming winter unless it became clear that the Government were in earnestin settling this matter.Sir Edward Carson stated that he could not agree wuthMr. Duke&apos;s presentation of the facts, and he thought that he hadnot correctly represented the point of view of the members for north-East Ulster. Several of these latter had asked to see him,and he explained that he found himself in a most difficult position.He listened to what the North-East Ulster representatives had tosay, but expressed no view himself. He gathered that their view was that it was useless to attempt an agreement on the subject ofthe constitution of the Irish Chambers until the specific powersof the Irish Parliament had been first agreed. On the financialquestion the representatives of North-East Ulster thought that theproposals so far adumbrated would mean ruin to their industries and would create an absolutely impossible position for them. he understood that Mr. Redmond&apos;s financial proposals included notonly absolute fiscal autonomy for the Irish Parliament, including thepower of setting up different tariffs from those obtaining for GreatBritain, but also the power of making separate commercial treaties with other nations. Under these circumstances the onus of a break-down could not be placed upon the representatives of North-EastUlster.Lord Milner asked whether the question of Preference had beenconsidered in relation to the proposed scheme of fiscal autonomy,and the Prime Minister read a letter from Mr. Redmond, dated the19th November, 1917, which seemed to give a different account ofthe proposed fiscal arrangement from that given either by the chief secretary or Sir Edward Carson.Mr. Long stated that no one in Great Britain would now toleratea fiscal system which enabled the Irish Parliament to make differentcommercial arrangements with Germany after the war from thosemade by Great Britain.The War Cabinet decided that In view of the uncertainty regarding the facts now at issue, theleading representatives of the Irish Convention should beasked to come over to see the Prime Minister as soon as he returned from France, in order that, as far as possible, the. , Cabinet might be informed of the actual situation ; andthat, meanwhile, individual members of the Governmentshould use their influence to urge their friends on theConvention to keep the Convention going, and to avoid a premature breakdown.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,November 22, 1917.
