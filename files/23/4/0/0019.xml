1. THE Director of Military Operations stated that we had attacked this morning on a wide front East of Ypres. All our objectives had been attained, and 1,500 prisoners had already beenaccounted for.East Africaj; 2. The Director of Military Operations produced a map showingthe area still occupied by the Germans in East Africa, and pointedout that the only two settlements still occupied by them wereMahenge and Livada. In spite of the great physical difficulties, itwas hoped that Mahenge would soon be occupied. The recent operations had been carried out in a country of rough bush, with no roads, which had presented the very greatest difficulties;in spite of these, however, the conduct of the campaign had been most praiseworthy.The western front.Escape of German 3. With reference to War Cabinet 239, Minute 5, the SecretaryPrisoners. Qf state for War  reported that all the 22 prisoners who had recently escaped from confinement at Donington had been re-captured, and that since the war only one officer and two men had succeeded in getting back to Germany. On the other hand, no lessthan 480 French prisoners had escaped from Germany back intoFrance, having traversed both the German and the French lines,while it. was credibly reported that no less than 2,200 russian prisoners had escaped from Germany in the course of one monthduring this year. Full investigation was being made into thecircumstances attending the escape from Donington, and a report would be made to the Cabinet in due course.Comparison ofBritish and GermanCaptures.4. The Director of Military Operations reported that thecaptures on the Western front this year up to the 30th Septemberamounted to 51,435 German prisoners and 232 guns, while our losses during the same period amounted to 15,065 prisoners lost andno guns. He also submitted similar figures for other theatres of war.The War Cabinet decided that Similar figures should be drawn up by the War Office for the half-year period April 9-October 9, 1917, and should bepublished.Submarines.5. The First Sea Lord reported as follows : (a) On the 1st October, 1917, a large &quot; America&quot; seaplanedropped two 230 lb. bombs on an enemy submarine. a quantity of oil and air-bubbles came to the surface for five minutes. It is probable that the submarine was destroyed.(6.) An airship reported a direct hit on a submarine with a100 lb. bomb, 8 miles west of Prawle Point, on the 3rdinstant. The trawlers following had dropped six depth charges in the neighbourhood of the submarine, and quantities of oil were seen.Naval Losses. 6. With reference to War Cabinet 243, Minute 10, the first sea Lord reported that the cruiser &quot;Drake&quot; had got into ChurchBay, near Eathlin Island, and had capsized in 7 fathoms of water.One officer and eighteen other ranks had been killed by an explosionin the stoke-hold.   The First Sea -Lord hoped that it might be
T.B.D. &quot;Brisk.&quot; 7. The First Sea Lord reported that the destroyer &quot; Brisk &quot; hadbeen mined in Pcathlin Sound, the forecastle being blown off. Oneofficer and nine men had been wounded, and thirty-one other ranksmissing. The Captain had been saved. The destroyer had beentowed into Lough Foyle in a severely damaged condition.Bombing Raids. 8. The First Sea Lord reported that-(a.) During the night of the lst-2nd October, over 2 tons of bombs were dropped on the Lock Gates at Zeebrugge,and nearly J5 cwt. of bombs dropped on sheds andmachines at St. Denis Westrem Aerodrome. All our machines returned safely.(b.) During the night of the 2nd-3rd October, further bombing raids were made on St. Denis Westrem, ZeebruggeLocks, Bruges Dock, and Thourout Railway Junction.A total weight of over 5 tons of bombs had been dropped on these objectives. All our machines returned safely.Attention was drawn, in this connection, to a newspaper reportfrom Amsterdam, stating that the Lock Gates at Zeebrugge hadbeen very severely damaged by recent air raids.Merchant shipping losses.Reports from naval attache^ Italy.9. The First Sea Lord reported that three ships carryinggeneral cargo had been lost on the 3rd October outside Gibraltar.The shortage of cruisers, for convoy purposes, prevented shipsbound for Gibraltar from the United Kingdom being taken out as a convoy. A big British ship making Brest, with material for the UnitedStates troops in France, had been torpedoed on the 2nd October,but had been beached, though in a bad place. A nitrate shipentering the Bristol Channel had also been torpedoed off the Smalls.10. With reference to War Cabinet 243, Minute 17, the first sea Lord reported that he had received a letter from the naval attache at Rome, stating that Admiral cli Revel remained quitestubborn in his determination to retain at Venice all the Italiandestroyers now there. The Naval Attache stated that the ships were at present continually at sea and were doing useful work, co-operating with the Italian Army. Turin and Genoa had been declared war zones, owing to the prevalence of German money and German spies. Evidence was forthcoming that the latter hadorganised schemes for destroying munition works and other essential war services which had led to this step now being taken.submarine warfare.11. Attention was drawn to an article in the &quot; Times &quot; ofthe 4th October, written by Lord Northcliffe, in which it was statedthat no substantial progress had been made in combating thesubmarine menace. It was pointed out that this statement was directly contradicted by the facts, and figures were submittedshowing that the losses in tonnage by submarine action had steadilydeclined since April last, while the destruction of enemy submarineshad steadily increased, and had reached a most satisfactory figureduring the last quarter.possible to salve the guns from H.M.S. &quot;Drake,&quot; and publication ofthe loss -would take place as soon as the relatives of casualties hadbeen informed.
Aerial OperationsCommittee.12. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byGeneral Smuts, Chairman of the Aerial Operations Committee(Paper G.T.-2178), asking for their sanction to certain recom-mendations of the Committee.It was suggested that if these recommendations were acceptedby the War Cabinet it was desirable that the Shipping Controllershould become a member of the Committee.The discussion was adjourned until General Smuts could be present.Air-raids:Provision of Coverin London..13. With reference to War Cabinet 242 A, Minute 3 (6), theattention of the War Cabinet was drawn to the desirability,especially in view of the fact that the Germans might be preparingair raids on a large scale, of taking measures to provide adequatecover for the population of London. Experience during the recentair raids demonstrated the tendency on the part of certain classes,notably poorer aliens, to become panic-stricken while a raid was inprogress. There had already been a considerable evacuation ofthese classes to the country, and businesses in the city and else-where had in consequence become to a certain extent dislocated.It was suggested that excellent cover might be arranged by theconstruction of dug-outs in the Parks. It was also pointed out thatcinder-bags were an efficient substitute for sand-bags, and might beplaced under the roofs or in the garrets of less substantially builthouses. It was suggested that this form of protection would be ofmore value against lateral explosions.The War Cabinet decided that  A Committee, consisting of representatives of : The War Office,The Home Office,The Local Government Board,A Secretary (to be appointed by the Chairman),should assemble at once to go into the whole question,reporting in due course their recommendations to the WarCabinet, and that Sir George Cave should be invited to be chairman of the Committee.Assistance of 14. The Secretary of State for War reported that he hadVolunteers. arranged to call out the Volunteers to assist the Special Constablesin dealing with the popvdation in the East End of London, hut was uncertain with regard to their compensation in the case of injurybeing received from Air Raiders while rendering this assistance.The War Cabinet decided that In the event of any Volunteers wearing Volunteer uniform beingkilled or injured while assisting the Police or militaryduring an air raid, the same compensation should be givento them or their relatives as had been laid down in regardto Volunteers being called out to repel an invasion.Insurance against 15. The   War   Cabinet  were  informed  that   an  influentialDamage. deputation, headed  by the Lord  Mayor of London, had beenreceived by the Prime Minister. The Lord Mayor, on behalf of thedeputation, had asked that the Government should consider thequestion of granting a universal indemnity for damage caused by air raids, the indemnity to have retrospective effect. The lord mayor further proposed that the present system of insurance shouldbe abolished, and that a Government indemnity should be sub-stituted for it.The War Cabinet were informed of the existing Government
Treatment of SinnFein Prisoners.Sinn Fein.The ZionistMovement.rate of insurance against damage caused by enemy aircraft.   It wasalso pointed out that it was necessary, in the event of the War Cabinetdeciding to sanction an indemnity, that critical and expert estimates of the damage caused in each instance should be available.The War Cabinet decided that A complete indemnity for the destruction of property causeddirectly by an enemy air raid, up to a maxinmm of 5001,should be payable by the Government without insurance,but that anything over that figure must be covered by insurance.The Treasury were instructed to produce a scheme in detail togive effect to this decision, and to publish the same assoon as possible.1G. With reference to War Cabinet 244, Minute 3, a telegram was read from the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of ireland to the Secretary of the War Cabinet, requesting instructions fromthe War Cabinet as to the issue of tobacco to Sinn Fein prisoners.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary should send a telegram to Mr. Duke, informing him that the War Cabinet considered that this was amatter which must be left to his discretion, and that theWar Cabinet would support his action.17. Attention was drawn to an article which had appeared inthe &quot; Daily Mail&quot; of the 4th October, giving an account of the SinnFein army alleged to exist in County Clare. The article stated that20,000 well-drilled men were marching about the County inprocession, saying, &quot;Up, Rebels, up with the Kaiser.&quot;The Secretary was instructed to call the attention of the chief secretary for Ireland to this article, and to ask him for areport thereon.18. With reference to War Cabinet 227, Minute 2, theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that the GermanGovernment were making great efforts to capture the sympathy ofthe Zionist Movement. This Movement, though opposed by anumber of wealthy Jews in this country, had behind it the supportof a majority of Jews, at aU events in Russia and America, andpossibly in other countries. He saw nothing inconsistent betweenthe establishment of a Jewish national focus in Palestine and thecomplete assimilation and absorption of Jews into the nationality of other countries. Just as English emigrants to the United Statesbecame, either in the first or subsequent generations, Americannationals, so, in future, should a Jewish citizenship be established in Palestine, would Jews become either Englishmen, Americans,Germans, or Palestinians. What was at the back of the ZionistMovement was -the intense national consciousness held by certain members of the Jewish race. They regarded themselves as one ofthe great historic races of the world, whose original home wasPalestine, and these Jews had a passionate longing to regain once more this ancient national home. Other Jews had become absorbedinfo the nations aniong whom they and their forefathers had dweltfqr many generations. Mr. Balfour then read a very sympatheticdeclaration by the Frenph Government which had been conveyed to the Zionists, and he stated that he knew that President Wilsonwas extremely favourable to the Movement.Attention was drawn to the contradictory telegrams receivedfrom Colonel House and Justice Brandeis (Papers G.T.-2015 and .T.-2158).O
Mr. Montagu urged strong objections to any declaration inwhich it was stated that Palestine was the &quot; national home &quot; of theJewish people. He regarded the Jews as a religious community and himself as a Jewish Englishman. He based his argument- onthe prejudicial effect on the status of Jewish Britons of a statement that His Majesty&apos;s Government regarded Palestine as the national home of Jewish people. Whatever safeguarding words might beused in the formula, the civil rights of Jews as nationals in thecountry in which they were born might be endangered. How wouldhe negotiate with the peoples of India on behalf of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment if the world had just been told that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment regarded his national home as being in Turkishterritory ? He specially urged that the only trial of strengthbetween Zionists and anti-Zionists in England had resulted in avery narrow majority for the Zionists, namely, 56 to 51 of therepresentatives of Angle-Jewry on the Conjoint Committee. he also pointed out that most English-born Jews were opposed toZionism, while it was supported by foreign-born Jews, such asDr. Caster and Dr. Herz, the two Grand Rabbis, who had beenborn in roumania and Austria respectively, and Dr. Weizmann,President of the English Zionist Federation, who was born inRussia. He submitted that the Cabinet&apos;s first duty was to EnglishJews, and that Colonel House had declared that President Wilson is opposed to a declaration now.Lord Curzon urged strong objections upon practical grounds.He stated, from his recollection of Palestine, that the country was,for the most part, barren and desolate ; there being but sparsecultivation on the terraced slopes, the valleys and streams beingfew, and large centres of population scarce, a less propitious seatfor the future Jewish race could not be imagined. How was it proposed to get rid of the existing majority of Mussulman inhabitantsand to introduce the Jews in their place ? How many would be willing to return and on what pursuits would they engage?To secure for the Jews already in Palestine equal civil andreligions rights seemed to him a better policy than to aim atrepatriation on a huge scale. He regarded the latter as sentimentalidealism, which would never be realised, and that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should have nothing to do with it.It was pointed out that during recent years before the War,Jewish immigration into Palestine had been considerably on theincrease, and that several flourishing Zionist colonies wez-e already in existence.Lord Milner submitted au alternative draft declaration, asfollows :  &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government views with favour the estab-lishment in Palestine of a National Home for the Jewish Race,and will use its best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object; it being clearly understood that nothing shallbe done which may prejudice the civil and religious rightsof the existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or therights and political status enjoyed in any other country by suchJews who are fully contented with their existing nationality and citizenship.&quot;The War Cabinet decided that Before coming to a decision they should hear the views of someof the representative Zionists, as well as of those who held the opposite opinion, and that meanwhile the declara-tion, as read by Lord Milner, should be submittedconfidentially to (a.) President Wilson.(6.) Leaders of the Zionist Movement,(c.) Representative persons in Anglo-Jewry opposedto Zionism.
War Aims 19. Sir Edward Carson, as Chairman of the War Aims Corn-Committee Finance, mittee, informed the War Cabinet that funds at the disposal of theCommittee, amounting to 17,000L, which had been raised by privatesubscription, were now exhausted. If the activities of the Committeewere to continue, further money must be placed at its disposal.There was a danger that, if the Committee had to rely upon privatesubscriptions only, the Pacifists would attribute this support to thecapitalist class. The Committee was composite in character, andconsisted of representatives of all political parties. There were three alternatives to be considered (a.) That the Committee should continue to rely upon privatesubscriptions, which was open to the objection given above.(b.) That Party Organisation funds, which, since the advent ofCoalition Governments, were not being utilised, shouldbe placed at the disposal of the War Aims Committee.(c.) That the Committee should be financed by the Treasury.Sir Edward Carson stated that at a meeting of his Committee, held the previous day, it had been unanimously decided to recommendthat the third alternative should be adopted.After some discussion the War Cabinet decided To   accept  in  principle   the   proposal that the War AimsCommittee should be financed by the Treasury.Propaganda. 20. The War Cabinet had under consideration the question of propaganda.   It was pointed out (a.) There was necessarily a considerable overlapping in regardto the propaganda carried out by the War Office and theDepartment of Information respectively.(b.) That as it was not practicable to draw a clear line of demarcation between home and foreign propaganda, thetwo should be combined as far as possible.(c.) That the only really efficient system of propaganda atpresent existing in this country was that organised bythe pacifists, who had large sums of money at their disposal and who were conducting their campaign withgreat vigour.It was suggested that the machinery put in motion the previous year in order to give publicity to the Government War Loan had proved most efficient, and that it might conveniently be resuscitatedfor the purpose of War Aims propaganda.It was further pointed out that the most effective propagandacould best be conducted, not in public halls, but in the open air,outside factories, &amp;c, by speakers who were associated with no political organisation.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,October 5, 1917.The Secretary was instructed to take the necessary action.The War Cabinet farther decided that the opinions receivedupon this draft declaration should be collated and submitted to them for decision.
