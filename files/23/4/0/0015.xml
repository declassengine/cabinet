The Policy of the&quot; Clean Slate &quot; inthe EventualTerms of Peace,1. WITH reference to War Cabinet 118, Minute 5, the WarCabinet considered the Report of a Sub-Committee on the Policy ofthe &quot;Clean Slate&quot; (Paper P.-21). They directed the Secretary toplace on record their thanks to Sir II. Babington Smith and his committee for their Report, which they noted would prove of theutmost value when considering the ultimate Terms of PeaceThe Secretary of State for the Colonies stated that the mafterwas discussed at the Imperial Conference, that the Dominions feltvery strongly on the matter, and that he had undertaken tocomrau-communicate the Report of the Committee to them for their consideration and remarks before transmitting the Report to the Allies.The War Cabinet decided In the first instance, to await the views of the Governments ofthe several Dominions in regard to the report, which theSecretary of State for the Colonies undertook to com-municate to the War Cabinet when received.Secondly, that the communication of the report to our allies should be postponed until the remarks of the dominions were available and had been considered.The Order of the 2. The War Cabinet had under consideration a note by theBritish Empire. Secretary of State for the Colonies (Paper G.T.-2129) on the subjectof the Order of the British Empire, in which he suggested that theChancellery of the Order should be located in the Home Office.The Prime Minister urged the importance of vesting in thehands of the Prime Minister the final decision in regard to therecommendations for such honours, as it would be impracticable todetail the head of one Government Department to adjudicate on theclaims put forward by the other Departments, and that a PrimeMinister was independent in such a matter, quite apart from beingthe liead of the Government. He mentioned that it was quite possible that a Prime Minister would appoint a Committee toconsider the recommendations; and the existing organisation ofthe War Cabinet, some of the members being without portfolios,fortunately lent itself to their serving on such a Committee.Lord Curzon stated that when the question had been consideredby a Committee composed of Mr. Barnes and Dr. Addison, over which he himself had presided, they had suggested the Chancelleryof the Order shoidd be located in the Home Office, for the purposeof keeping records and papers, but n&apos;ot for the decision as to thehonours to be conferred.Lord Derby said that the War Office point of view was theappointment of someone with whom they could discuss the merits of the persons recommended.The War Cabinet was informed that a Departmental Committeewas already considering a number of questions relating to theOrder of the British Empire, including the following : -(a.) The total numbers of each Class to be given in the UnitedKingdom.(6.) The total number to be allotted to India.(c.) The total number to be allotted to the Dominions.(d.) The total number to be allotted to the Crown Colonies.((?.) Should Civil Servants be eligible for the Order;  if so,should they have a special Gazette to themselves, or should they be included in the ordinary Gazette.(/&apos;.) On what principle should the Order be distributed to theAllied countries, and should the numbers be limited.(g.) Should members of the Diplomatic and Consular Servicesbe eligible for the Order ?(h.) Should officers of the Army and Navy be eligible for theOrder ?   If so, what should be the distinction between
Visit of italian and FrenchParliamentaryCommittees.3. The War Cabinet decided that The British Parliamentary Committee should be authorised to invite the Committees of the French and Italian Parlia-ments to visit this country during the autumn, andsanctioned their entertainment at Government expense, thecost being estimated at between 500L and 1,000 .The Secretary was directed to communicate this decision toMr. H. J. Mackinder, the Secretary to the British Parlia-mentary Committee.The Western Front.L The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that in therecent attack our casualties had been light. Eight divisions took part, as to two of which no information as to casualties had yet beenreceived, but as regards the remaining six divisions the casualties were only a little over 4,000 on the first day.5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that Germanorders of June last had been captured setting out the arrangementsfor the retirement of a Bavarian Division near St. Mihiel. these orders, he said, had some significance, as an indication that theGermans were preparing for emergencies.6. In connection with the French proposal that during thewinter we should take over more of the Western Front, the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff drew the attention of the War Cabinetto the fact that the French were retaining their 1918 class, i.e., thosewho would be 20 years of age next year, in the depots, and that theywere not to be sent to the front before next spring. Further, thatthey had not yet absorbed in the divisions at the front all their 1917class. He remarked that we were sending to the front all ourmen who wrere over 19.Bulgaria. 7. q-h.e &quot;War Cabinet took note of a statement in the press of an interview given by the Bulgarian Minister at Washington to a UnitedStates press representative, which indicated that Bulgaria was satisfied now that she had attained her territorial desires, and was now ready to make peace, and that she had no quarrel with the main body of the Allies.those who get existing military decorations and thosewho get the O.B.E. ?(i.) Re similar distinction between officers in Allied countries,(j.) Should the Order be given to neutrals or be confined toAllies ?(7c.) Should a certain number be placed at the disposal of theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs for instant awardto foreigners ?(I.) How and by whom should the Medal of the Order begiven ?The Prime Minister decided to ascertain the views of ex-Prime &apos;Ministers Lord Rosebery, Mr. Balfour, and Mr. Asquith before afinal decision was reached.   In the meantime the Committee referredto above should complete their labours and render their report forthe consideration of the War Cabinet.
Submarines. 8. The First Sea Lord reported that one of our destroyers had dropped a depth charge on a submarine in the vicinity of Dover,but no information had been received as to whether the attack hadbeen successful. The destroyer had entered our mine-field in pursuit of the submarine, and as a result had been damaged. he further stated that he had just received information that an*enemy submarine had been sunk by our aircraft off Zeebrugge, but no details had yet been received.Bombing raids : p,. jn connection with the report of the bombing of fifteen, St. Denis Westrem. &quot; Gotha&apos;s &apos;,&apos; at the St. Denis Westrem Aerodrome, the First Sea Lordstated that thirteen 65-lb. bombs and sixty-eight 16-lb. bombs hadbeen dropped on the &quot; Gotha&apos;s &quot; and the aerodromes in the vicinity.Zeebrugge.Eaider&quot; Seeadler.&quot;10. The First Sea Lord reported that the first attack by aircraft on the Zeebrugge Locks was carried out last night, and that a report had been received that the North Lock had been destroyed, but thatreliance should not be placed on the same until photographs hadbeen obtained.11. The First Sea Lord stated that a report had been received that the German raider &quot; Seeadler &quot; (a sailing-ship with auxiliaryengines) had gone ashore in the Pacific. A statement had beenreceived from some of the crew, who had been picked up in a motor-boat, as to the island on which she had stranded, and orders hadbeen given for a ship to search the vicinity.Acceleration ofMerchant Ship-building in theUnited States ofjAmerica.12. Mr. Balfour said that he had received a proposal from Sir L.Chiozza Money suggesting that a statement should be sent to president Wilson from the Prime Minister and the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, making an urgent appeal to the Presidentfor the acceleration of merchant shipbuilding in the United States ofAmerica.The War Cabinet asked The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to forward Sir L.Chiozza Money&apos;s statement to the Secretary, who shouldhave it copied and circulated to members of the WarCabinet, for discussion at a, subsequent Meeting.MercantileShippingConstruction.13. The First Lord of the Admiralty informed the WarCabinet that the shipbuilding programme was falling behind,owing to lack of steel plates, and that he estimated that the shippingoutput during the next twelve months would not exceed 2,000,0c0tons. He stated that, owing to lack of material, the men in the shipyards were not at present fully employed.&apos; Shipping Losses. 14. With reference to War Cabinet 128, Minute 8, the WarCabinet had under consideration an Admiralty Memorandumrelative to the Weekly Returns of Shipping Losses (paper g.T.-2125), in which it was stated that figures of arrivalsand sailings as now published are misleading in some respects, as they included foreign-owned vessels, whereas the losses excluded foreign sinkings. Further, the wholeof the coasting services are included, each intermediate port of callbeing counted twice, as an entry and a sailing, and in addition to this anomaly, there are other cases of duplication. For example, theFirst Lord mentioned that a ship bound for Goole which called atHull would be counted twice, and the same was true of ships calling
15. The War Cabinet had under consideration a telegram fromSir W. Wiseman, New York, to Sir Eric Drummond, of the ForeignOffice, containing a statement that it might be possible to pers\iadePresident Wilson to send over Colonel House or Mr. Baker, theWar Minister, on an official visit to London and Paris (paper g.T.-2126).Mr. Balfour gave his personal opinion that Colonel House was so valuable in the United States that, notwithstanding the importanceof a visit by him to this country, it was doubtful whether he oughtto be pressed to come. Mr. Baker would also be very valuable, butit was very unlikely that his services could be spared from theUnited States.The War Cabinet felt that, in view of forthcoming international conferences, it was of great importance that men in the completeInter-AlliedConferences:Proposed Eepre-sentation of theUnited States ofAmerica.Proposed Visit by colonel House.at Lerwick, although in this latter case the ship would run a riskin leaving as well as in entering the harbour. Another anomalymentioned was that, although losses in the Mediterranean were included, Mediterranean entrances and clearances were not. Thusthere was no true comparison between the losses and the shipsentering and clearing British ports. The First Lord recommendedthat future returns should only show (-a.) The number of British ships sunk.(6.) The number of British ships unsuccessfully attacked.Further, that a monthly statement should be issued on the first ofevery month, giving the tonnage of British ships sunk, thestatement to be published one month in arrear. The First Lordproposed that, iu order to prevent the enemy from checking his ownreturns of our losses from British figures, the statement shoidd begiven for a period of four weeks without stating the dates whichwere referred to. As regards the monthly statement the WarCabinet did not lose sight of the motive which had influenced themwhen the question was considered on the 1st May, 1917 (WarCabinet 128, Minute 8\ &quot;that the losses might eventually becomeso serious that it would be impossible to make them known.&quot; Notewas taken of the recent decrease in losses, and the possibility oftheir not increasing during the rough weather that may be expectedduring the winter months and the longer nights that then prevail.On the other hand, if the losses increased it could be used as an argument to encourage a reduced consumption of food.As regards the entries and sailings, it was pointed out that,though they were misleading in some respects, they neverthelessrepresented the number of targets that were presented to the enemy,and, further, that in the case of every entry and sailing, the shipran the chance of being pained. Further, as a reason againstomitting the entries and sailings, it was pointed out that it wouldbe very awkward for the Government to explain why they hadallowed the publication of these figures for so long.The War Cabinet decided To adhere to the present form showing the entries and sailingsand the number of vessels lost, hut to ask the First lord to consider the exact form in which the tonnage figures ofsinkings should be issued, with a view to preventing, ifpossible, the enemy from being able to check his ownreturns from the Admiralty figures.It was suggested that a bi-monthly or possibly even a quarterlyreturn of sinkings - might meet the requirements of thecase.The First Lord undertook to submit his proposals on thesubject to the War Cabinet.
confidence of President Wilson should visit Western Europe inorder to obtain first-hand information in regard to the position ofthe Allies, and Colonel House appeared to be the only suitableperson.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook to put pressure on Colonel House to visit Europe, unless, on further consideration, he discovered strong objections tothis course. In the latter case he would again bring thequestion before the War-Cabinet.&amp;T. &apos;i- 1 ITLiquor restriction ig, Tne War Cabinet considered a memorandum on the future and Control. supply of beer by the Food Controller (Paper G.T.-21f9) and thePresident of  the Board   of  Agriculture   and   Fisheries   (paper g.T.-2141).lord Rhondda explained that, as arranged at War Cabinet .176,Minute 19, and War Cabinet 216, Minute 6, on the 1st October the permitted barrelage reverts to the rate of 10,700,000 barrels perannum, plus navy and army requirements, unless the Cabinet came to some fresh decision immediately. Whilst most anxious to con-serve all cereals available for human food, he recognised that someof the prevailing industrial unrest was due to the restricted quantityof beer available, to its quality, and to its price. He recommended,with reluctance, that the War Cabinet should sanction for anotherquarter brewing on the scale at present in force. He should likealso to impose the conditions that no beer - should be designated&quot;Government Ale&quot; that was not of fair quality, and that amaximum price snould be fixed for a considerable proportion of thebeer retailed.Dr. Addison pointed out that, if the present high prices were reduced, consumption would be stimulated. This was an undesirableresult, unless the Government were prepared to find more beer.Further, if it be assumed that the present high prices impliedprofiteering, it was better to allow the charge to lie against the brewers than against the Government.Sir George Cave said he was very doubtful- of the wisdom ofinterfering with prices.Lord Rhondda said that the demand might quite probablyincrease with the fall of prices, but there was no doubt that thepublicans wrere selling a poor quality of beer at a high price, andthat the Government were being blamed for this. He knew that,whatever policy they followed, they would have some opposition from the Temperance Party.The War Cabinet (a.) Sanctioned for another quarter the 33-J- increase in thestandard bairelagc already permitted for the currentquarter.(6.) Authorised the Food Controller to prevent beer beingdesignated as &quot; Government Ale &quot; which is of a gravitybelow J036&quot;.(c.) Requested the Food Controller to confer with the brewersand make the best bargain he could with them in regardto retail prices.2, Whitehall Gardens, London, S.W.,September 28, 1917.o
