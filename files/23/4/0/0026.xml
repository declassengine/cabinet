Wages of skilled workers in engineering andFoundry Trades.1. WITH reference to War Cabinet 248. Minute 12. the WarCabinet took note of the following decision by Lord Milner andMr. Barnes in regard to the wages of skilled workers in theengineering and foundry trades (Paper G.T.-2282) : &quot; That fully qualified skilled time-workers in theengineering and foundry trades should be granted an increaseof 12J per cent, upon their weekly earnings, provided thattheir wages equalled or exceeded the district time-rate payable to fitters and turners. Such increase to commence&apos;in the firstfull week after the 14th October, 1917. This increase shallnot apply to men with upstanding wage or salary coveringovertime.&quot;Situation among 2. Sir Edward Carson stated that he had received a messageSouth Wales from Sir George Riddell to the effect that the situation in the SouthMiners. Wales coalfield was very serious, owing to&apos; the organised resistance of anti-war elements against any combing-out for military serviceof men engaged in the industry. A ballot was shortly to be held as to whether a strike should be called as a protest against thecombing-out of fit men of military age who had entered the coal-mining industry for the first time since the outbreak of war.Sir Auckland Geddes enforced the above statement, and statedthat the situation required the most delicate handling. The minesrepresented the last remaining big pool upon which he could drawboth for recruiting for the Army and for transferable labour.It was rjointed out that, in view of the paramount importanceof this issue and the strength of the Governments case in regard toit, the desirability of facing a strike, if it could be confined to onelocality, such as South Wales, should be considered, the example ofthe defeat of the Glasgow strikers in 1915 being instanced as insome waj^s a parallel case.The War Cabinet understood that a request was being putforward by patriotic leaders in South Wales that General Smutsshould address a war aims meeting somewhere in the coalfield,with a view to his encouraging those miners who remainedpatriotic and were doing their best to resist syndicalist and pacifistinfluence.General Smuts expressed his willingness to address a meetingat Mountain Ash at an early date.The War Cabinet decided that The Minister of National Service should make enquiriesof the. Admiralty with regard to their present reserve of Welshcoal, in order that an estimate might be formed as to how longit would be possible for the country to stand a strike in SouthWales without incurring danger.Observance, of a 3  The  War  Cabinet  had  under  consideration  a  letterDay of Prayer.        addressed to the Prime Minister by the Archbishop of Canterbury(Paper G.T.-2272).The War Cabinet decided that While it would be unwise for the Government to appoint a day of &quot; humiliation and prayer,&quot; as had been suggested at an earlier stage, the Archbisbop&apos;s new proposal, for the setting aside of a day for invoking the Divine blessing uponthe deliberations and arms of the Allied Forces, was prefer-able, and suggested that the first Sunday in 1918 should be selected for this purpose.It was agreed that it would be unnecessary for the PrimeMinister to receive the suggested deputation upon the subject,and the Prime Minister undertook to discuss the question with
Labour Disputes. &quot;4. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by lord milner and Mr. Barnes (Paper G.T.-2194 A) on the subject of thesettlement of labour disputes involving increases of wages.Lord Milner pointed out that cases had arisen whereby labour disputes had been settled by one Department in such a manner that other Government Departments were affected. He thoughtthat it was absolutely necessary that in every case there should be one ultimate authority, such as the Committee on Production, who should deal with disputes the result of which was likely to affect a wider sphere of work than that which was under the immediatecontrol of an individual Government Department. There was,for instance, the demand of the coal-mining industry that theyshould be treated in a water-tight compartment, thus making theminers a State within a State. If this principle were aeknow-ledged, a decision in favour of one set of workmen prejudiced theissue in many other cases. Some form of centralisation was absolutely necessary.Sir David Shackleton pointed out that unless some centralauthority were recognised it might he possible for employers and employees in a particular trade to come to some arrangement,involving a high cost to the State, which disregarded the national interest. The Ministry of Labour had no desire to interfere inthe many small disputes of a local and subsidiary character, in thesettlement of which any delay was most undesirable; but in all those questions of a wider character which involved increases of wage to large classes of labour it had now become essential, whereState control of industries had been established, that the State,acting through some central authority, should be a party to any settlement.Mr. Kellaway pointed out that the Ministry of Munitions hadstatutory powers under the Munitions Act to deal, inter alia, withthe question of the wages of skilled workers.Sir Lynden Macassey pointed out that very special andpeculiar conditions related to work in His Majesty&apos;s Dockyards,which must be decided by the Admiralty.Both the Ministry of Munitions and the Admiralty were most anxious that all questions of this kind should be discussed with theMinistry of Labour, and that the Ministry of Labour should havethe fullest opportunity of submitting their views to the Depart-ments immediately concerned in the settlement of a dispute.Similarly, Departments concerned should have the right of entry to the Committee on Production, to be heard in connection withdisputes referred to that body.The  War  Cabinet   approved   the   statement   (paper g.T.-2194 A) principle, and left it to the Departments toarrange its application in detail with the Minister of Labour.recruiting of Coal 5. Sir Auckland Geddes stated that the Coal Controller and miners. he had had a conversation about the recruiting of men engaged in coal mines.     They were agreed that recruiting was purely a function for the Minister of National Service.    In view of thepossible dispute in South Wales, referred to in Minute 2, he askedfor a Cabinet decison ratifying this agreement.The War Cabinet decided that The recruiting of men from coal mines should be one ofthe functions of the Ministry of National Service,the Archbishop of Canterbury, with a view to  a possible:representation being made in due course to His Majesty theKing.
Eecognition of 6. With reference to War Cabinet 221, Minute 14, the WarOrganisations other Cabinet had before them the following documents:-than the Civil .   .                   .          ,         ,         &quot;                            ,Servjce (a.) Memorandum   by    the    Postmaster-General    (paper g.T.-2016).(6.) Note by the Minister of Munitions (Paper G.T.-2118).(c.) Memorandum bv the Conciliation and Arbitration Board(Paper G.T.-1731). *id.) Memorandum  bv  the   Ministry   of   Labour   (paper g.T.-1732).The Postmaster-General pointed out that in 1906 internalPost Office unions had been recognised, and that a great dangerexisted if outside organisations, such as the Transport Workers&apos;Federation, were recognised as in any way party to disputesaffecting Postal servants. Should the Transport Workers&apos; Federa-tion be placed in a position to call out the Postal transport workers,the whole business of the country might be held up. ThePostmaster-General read an extract from the Minority Report ofa Royal Commission signed; among others, by Sir Henry Primroseand Sir Guy Granet, pointing out the danger of outside unionsbeing admitted to disputes or agreements with Civil Servants. he added that the London County Council had recently decided notto recognise outside unions in dealing with their employees.Dr. Macnamara pointed out that the Admiralty had admittedrepresentatives of outside organisations as spokesmen only, andnot as parties to any concessions made by the Admiralty to their employees. The Admiralty did not make arrangements or con-tracts &quot;with their employees, but only concessions.Sir William Collins, M.P., Chairman of the Conciliation and arbitration Board for Government Employees, thought that themethod adopted by the Admiralty suggested a compromise whichthe Government could undertake with safety.The Postmaster-General and the Ministry of Labour con-curred in the view expressed by Sir William Collins, but the latterthought that the whole matter should receive further carefulenquiry.The War Cabinet decided that The terms of reference to the Conciliation and arbitration board for Government Employees should be amended to read as follows : &quot; Method of Procedure. Any claim which may fall within the terms of reference shall be heard before theBoard acting as a triplicate chairman, together with notmore than three official representatives and not more than three representatives of the class of employees concernedor their associations, where such association exists. Pro-vided that in all cases the employees concerned shall beat liberty to nominate as one of their representativesa person who is not a. member of the class in question.Such a person shall not, however, be a signatory to any agreement arrived at by conciliation. The official repre-sentatives shall be appointed in cases where employees of only one Government Department are concerned two bythat Department and one by the Treasury. In other cases they shall all be appointed by the Treasury. Inthe first instance, the official representatives and the employees&apos; representatives shall, endeavour to arrange thedifference by mutual agreement, but should they fail tosettle the matter by conciliation the case will be at oncereferred to the Board acting as Arbitrators, who may call for further evidence if they desire and give such other directions as they may think necessary for the properdecision of the matters in dispute.&quot;
Attack on Convoyby German light cruisers.7. The First Sea Lord reported that on the previous day two destroyers, the &quot; Strongbow &quot; and the &quot; Mary Rose/&apos; whileescorting the Scandinavian Convoy, had been attacked and sunk by two German light cruisers about sixty miles east of the shetlands. After disposing of the escort, the enemy proceeded toattack the merchantmen in the convoy. Out of 8 of these mer-chantmen 3 had arrived undamaged at Lerwick, of which two were british ; and of the remaining 5, from reports at present receivedit appeared that 4 were on fire and 1 was in a sinking condition.The other escorting craft of trawders and a whaler were reportedto have escaped. With regard to the loss of life, there were nosurvivors from the &quot; Mary Rose &quot; ; 4 officers and 35 men had been saved from the &quot; Strongbow,&quot; and 39 men from the merchantmen.At the time when it happened five British light cruiser squadronswere in the North Sea, and the First Lord pointed out that evenif we had had notice of the enemy&apos;s coming, and had put out ourmaximum forces, we could not have been more ready to interceptthe enemy.The First Sea Lord showed on a chart illustrating the area ofvisibility of our cruisers, the difficulty of ensuring the interception of fast light cruisers on a dark night. It was probable that theenemy vessels were of a new type of light cruisers, with a speed of34 knots; that is to say. 4 to 5 knots faster than any of our light cruisers. He reminded the War Cabinet that the Admiralty had always expected that sooner or later an attack would be made upon our convoys. It had also been recognised that the Scandinavian-scandinavian Convoy was the one most liable to be attacked. He drew attention to the fact that ihe Germans must have been very avellinformed of our route, and a telegram had been sent to Norwayin regard to leakage of information. The Admiralty were considering the problem of the best method of securing the safety of the Scandinavian Convoy against further attacks of this kind,and he indicated the general lines on which this would be tackled.The First Lord stated that this was the first occasion onwhich neutral ships had been sunk bv surface craft without taking off the crews, which was a most serious breach of Inter-national Law.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointed out thatthe moral effect in Scandinavia would be very bad.The War Cabinet discussed the question of publication,and deferred a decision until the German communique was to hand.It was decided In any case to publish the loss of our two destroyers, butthat, in accordance with the usual practice, no publica-tion should be made Until the next-of-kin had been advised.Comparison ofBritish and ForeignWarships.8. In the course of the discussion recorded in the previousMinute, attention was called to the comparison of Americandestroyers with British destroyers, and also to the comparison ofthe latest type of German light cruisers with British light cruisers.In both cases the British vessels compared unfavourably in someparticulars, though not necessarily in all respects, with the latestforeign types.T ,        (rnrn 9. With reference to War Cabinet 250, Minute 4, the ChiefsSClM Haig. of the Imperial General Staff reported the receipt of a telegramfrom Sir Douglas Haig expressing the thanks of the british armies in France and himself for the message of congratulation
which had been sent him by the Prime Minister on behalf of theWar Cabinet.The Secretary of State for War undertook to arrange for thepublication of Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s reply.Port and Transit 10. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byExecutive Mr. Joseph Davies in regard to the proposed readjustment of theCommittee. Port arid Transit Executive Committee (Paper G.T.-2281).Sir Norman Hill outlined the history and work of this Com-mittee, of which he was now Chairman. Appointed two years ago,the Committee had worked smoothly until July of this year, when,at the request of the Executive Council of the National TransportWorkers&apos; Federation, the Labour representatives, including Mr.Harry Gosling, withdrew from the Central Committee and fromall the local Port and Transit Committees, for reasons given inthe Memorandum. A scheme had now been asreed bv the Depart-ments concerned and the Labour representatives whereby the dock Labour representatives will rejoin the Central and LocalPort and Transit Committees, and the National Union of railwaymen will also co-operate. The new Committee will thus be fully representative.Sir Auckland Geddes raised a cognate question in his memorandum (Paper G.T.-2307) deprecating any extension ofthe system of military compelled labour, particularly in connec-tion with the Transport Workers&apos; Battalions. He pointed outthe unfortunate effect which such a form of labour has on labourgenerally by arousing suspicions of indirect industrial compulsion.Resistance to recruiting was spreading throughout thecountry; the case of South Wales had already been referred to(vide Minute 2 above), and there were other centres where themovement was developing. There was a widespread resentmentcaused by seeing a man who one day was in civilian clothes anda few days later reappeared in khaki at a lower rate of wages.The same principle applied to soldiers engaged in agriculture.Lord Derby said he entirely agreed with what Sir A. Geddeshad stated.Sir Auckland Geddes requested that his Department mightbe represented on Sir Norman Hill&apos;s Central Committee, in viewof the fact that it was to a great extent a Man-Power Committee.The War Cabinet decided that  ^T-\.(a.) The scheme for the readjustment of the Port and transit Executive Committee (Paper G.T.-2281),which had been agreed to by all the Departments con-cerned, and Labour, should be adopted.(b.)&apos; The National Service Department should be represented on the Central Committee and the Local Committees,provided that the other Departments expressed noobjection.(c.) The question of the principle of military compelledlabour, in such forms as the Transport Workers&apos;Battalions and Agricultural Companies, should beraised again by the Minister of National Service at ahearly date.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,October 18, 1917.o
