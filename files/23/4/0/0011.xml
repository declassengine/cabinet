The Western Front. 1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported thatexcellent progress had been made on the previous day in the fightingnear Ypres. He explained, by means of a map, what the objectiveshad been, and how all had been won. We had succeeded in gaininga ridge which included the Inverness Copse, a point of greatimportance. A particularly satisfactory feature of this success wasthat the Germans knew the attack was coming ; they had madegreat efforts to keep this ridge, which they had previously held fora long time, and they really had meant to keep it now.The Secretary of State for War reported that, although thefigures were not yet complete, the casualties, as at present advised,amounted to about 5,000.Ital7- 2. With reference to War Cabinet 232, Minute 2, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff reported that the guns which the allies had sent from France had now arrived in Italy. He stated,however, that he had received information of a serious nature, tothe effect that General Cadorna had modified his plans and did not now propose to take the offensive again during the rest of the year ;he was going to wait for the Austrians to attack, and then he wouldmake a counter-attack.The Secretary of State for War pointed out that it had been laid down by General Petain, at the time when it had been decidedto send the guns to Italy, that if there was no further offensive onthe part of the Italian army the 100 guns were to be returned tothe French front.Lord Derby stated that the whole change in the Italian plano f campaign had been made since he left Italy. When he was there,during last wreek, everythiug was in readiness for another attack.He said that great difficulties had been made by the civil authoritiesin calling up more men, especially in places like Turin, where therehad been serious labour trouble. At the same time, there were large numbers of Italian soldiers in every valley near the Front,and it did not seem that shortage of troops could be the reason for not taking the offensive. Possibly the fear of heavy casualties hadinfluenced the Italian Government.In view of this change of plan on the part of the Italians, andits possible far-reaching consequences, the War Cabinet were anxious to obtain the opinion of Sir Rennell Rodd, who had justarrived in England, and they therefore adjourned consideration ofthe matter until they could discuss it with him.At a later stage, when Sir Rennell Rodd was able to be present,the War Cabinet heard his views on the telegram which had beenreceived by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff from GeneralDelme-Radcliffe (Appendix I).Sir Rennell Rodd stated that he could not explain this suddenchange of policy. When he left Italy on Monday night (17thSeptember), he did not know such a change was in contemplate-tion, nor of anything in the state of the country to justify it. Whenhe spoke to Baron Sonnino, before leaving for England, BaronSonnino was under the impression that an early offensive was to takeplace before winter weather set in and made it impossible. He didnot think the fear of large casualties was the explanation. Thenumber of casualties was not published in Italy, and it would take some time for the numbers to leak out so as to be used by thepacifists. He suggested that it would be desirable to send atelegram to Baron Sonnino, pointing out that the policy nowannounced was in contradiction of what we had been given tounderstand, and asking for an explanation.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in consultation withthe Chief of the Imperial General Staff, should send a
ootelegram to Baron Sonnino saying that we had heard of theabandonment of the Italian offensive with extreme surprise ;that it was inexplicable to us, having in view the recentdespatch of 100 guns, in compliance with GeneralCadprna&apos;s earnest request; and that the decision was very embarrassing to our military operations on other fronts.Lord Derby&apos;s interview withM. Painleve :General Sarrail.3. Lord Derby reported that, on his way to Italy and also onhis return, he had seen M. Painleve, who had raised once more thequestion of lengthening our lines. Lord Derby had told him thatthe matter would receive attention, but that no decision could bereached until after this year&apos;s operations were over.This had given Lord Derby the opportunity of referring to thesubject of change of command in Salonica. M. Painleve had spoken in praise of General Sarrail, adducing the argument thatthe only decisive victory which had been won during the war hadbeen General Sarraif&apos;s victory at Monastir. M. Painleve had saidthat, if we definitely demanded the recall of General Sarrail, itwould cause great trouble ; if, on the other hand, we hinted that wewere going to demand his recall, means would probably be foundwhereby General Sarrail would resign.M. Painleve had not realised that the Prime Minister and theWar Cabinet were really antagonistic to General Sarraif&apos;s tenure ofthe Salonica Command. The impression derived by Lord Derby onhis recent visit to Italy was that if the Prime Minister would put pressure on M. Painleve to recaU General Sarrail, we should be supported by Italy, Serbia, and Greece.Submarines. 4. The First Sea Lord reported that the decoy ship &quot; Stonecrop &quot;claimed to have sunk an enemy submarine on the 17th instant offthe Fastnet, but up to the present it had not been possible to obtainconfirmation of the sinking, as the &quot; Stonecrop &quot; herself was torpedoed on the 18th, and sunk 6S miles off the Fastnet. It was feared that the loss of life was considerable.Provision ofAdditional sea transport for troops in theMediterranean.5. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theChief of the Imperial General Staff (Paper G.T.-2055), and aMemorandum by the First Sea Lord (Paper G.T.-20S5), pointing out the shortage of tonnage available in the Mediterranean for themovement of troops from Mediterranean ports in case of emergencyarising in Mesopotamia or Lidia.It was pointed out that, during the first two years of the war,we had always kept in the Mediterranean a reserve of troopships for two divisions. Owing to the general scarcity of shipping, thisreserve has been withdrawn little by little, and we have not sufficientships to meet the normal demands in the Mediterranean.The First Sea Lord pointed out what would be the effect ofproviding troopships for this work ; first of all there would be the direct loss of the carrying capacity of the vessels, and the consequentdecrease in importations of food into this country ; then, by takingthe class of steamer required for troopship purposes, it would beimpossible to use them to complete the convoy system, and that,therefore, there would be risk of increased losses ; there would alsobe a diminution in the amount of coal to be sent to Italy, since the escort required for the increased number of transports in theMediterranean would make it necessary to cancel for a time thearrangements for sending increased traffic for the East through theMediterranean instead of round the Cape.
The Director of Transports said that Sir Joseph Maclay, whowas unable to be present, had agreed that if the Cabinet decidedthat it was of vital importance to keep a reserve of shipping in theMediterranean for the purpose indicated, he could find the ships.Of the three alternatives put forward in the First Sea Lord&apos;sMemorandum, the War Cabinet considered that the third should beadopted. This would necessitate the finding of about seventeenships to bring the number up to the requirements for carrying a division and a half. The First Lord emphasised the fact that theAdmiralty could only supply the escort by withdrawal from otherescort services at present considered essential, and that the lockingup of shipping thus contemplated would interfere with the allocation of further merchant ships as armed auxiliary cruisers a measuremost necessary for the extension of the convoy system.The War Cabinet recognised that their decision involved thesedrawbacks, but were of opinion that the ships must be found,and found immediately, in order to be prepared for sudden need inMesopotamia.After some discussion it was decided That the Shipping Controller should provide the necessaryships, which would be able to carry approximately a division and a half, which could arrive in Basra in twenty-nine days from the first sailing from Marseilles, if Marseilles wereselected as the port of embarkation ; and that theAdmiralty should supply the necessary escort.Aerial Operations. 0. With, reference to  War Cabinet 236, Minute 6, the WarCabinet had under further consideration a Memorandum by general smuts (Paper G.T.-2062), and certain correspondence between theChief of the Imperial General Staff and Field-Marshal Sir douglas haig (Paper G.T.-2058), as to aerial operations, &amp;c.General Smuts pointed out that the real question which he wished to raise was that at the present moment there were two airprogrammes : One, a limited programme, which, inter alia, providedfor 86 squadrons being maintained on the Western front; theother, the Air Board programme, which made provision for a RoyalFlying Corps with 200 squadrons attached. He stated that, onenquiry into the matter, he found that even the limited pro-gramme was thought to be in jeopardy, and he was ofopinion that, unless priority was given to everything apper-taining to the provision of the requisite material for theAir Forces, the forces asked for by Sir Douglas Haig wouldnot be forthcoming. He advocated that, in addition to givingpriority to the limited programme, reasonable additional priority should be given, where possible, with the object of attaining theAir Board programme as far as might be practicable. He drew theattention of the War Cabinet to Sir William Weir&apos;s Memorandum,which appears as an Appendix to Paper G.T.-2062, and stated thatthe situation as set forth therein referred to the smaller programme.The Minister of Munitions stated that it was news to him thatthere was any doubt as to the limited programme being carried out.The forecast published had, so far, broadly speaking, been main-tained, and no reports had reached him that there wTas likely to beany failure in the production of the necessary number of engines.He added that he had given instructions that in the Ministry ofMunitions every priority was to be given to Sir William Weir asregarded aeronautical supply, and he thought that the latter&apos;s papercovered the whole air policy as formulated by the Air Board.Sir David Henderson stated that the limited programme was likely to be late, for, although the number of squadrons (namely, 86)might be in existence by the date contemplated, some of the
squadrons would not have machines of the latest type. Accelerationwas required rather than an increased programme.The Minister of Munitions stated that it was not an easy matter to accelerate the supply of engines, and that changes of design mustnecessarily affect the output; in addition to this, he had had considerable difficulties in getting the necessary labour, as well asin persuading the Carpenters&apos; Union to accept the principle of payment by results. Mr. Churchill stated that he had a Committeesitting at the Ministry of Munitions with a view to improve theallocation of such skilled labour as was available.Sir David Henderson mentioned that he thought the delay was partly due to inefficient labour, as there was, he understood, a lackof skilled labour in the engine works, with the result that a verylarge number of cylinders had to be scrapped after inspection and before use, owing to faulty construction.   -Sir Eric Geddes pointed out that the Memorandum ofSir William Weir dealt very largely with affairs which intimatelyconcerned the War Office and the Admiralty, and that, beforeaccepting the same as an agreed document on the part of theAdmiralty, he would like to be selected as a member of a Committeeto enquire into the whole situation in so far as it affected the Navy.The War Cabinet decided that  As there was a considerable difference of opinion as to facts, itwas essential that the matter should be further considered,and requested General Smuts (Chairman),Lord Derby,Sir Eric Geddes,Mr. Churchill, andLord CowdrayMajor L. Storr (Secretary).to form a Committee and enquire at the earliest date intothe conditions that prevail, and to report to them as soonas possible on the whole situation, giving their recom-mendations as to priority and the effect that any piiority,if granted, would have on the output for the Army and navy, and in what direction.7. The War Cabinet took note of the recommendation byGeneral Smuts that sanction should be given for the immediateoccupation of a limited acreage (at most 4,000 acres) of arable landreqtured for aerodromes.Sir David Henderson stated that his Department had consulted the Food Production Department in this matter, and that he had endeavoured, in putting forward his proposals, to select land withthe lightest soil and the least valuable for food production.The War Cabinet gave general sanction to the taking over-of -land to the extent of 4,000 acres for the purpose stated,but directed Sir David Henderson to exercise every consideration in order to avoid, as far as possible, taking over any ground that was likely to be of a highlyproductive nature for the growth of cereals.S. With reference to War Cabinet 236, Minute 9, general smuts stated that he had consulted with the Admiralty and thatthey were prepared to abate their programme for the constructionof airships by reconsidering the question of the design of the shedat Flookburgh, with a view to using considerably less steel in itserection. Further, they were prepared to drop the Alexandra237] C
Factory (near Glasgow) scheme as regards new airship building-sheds. This meant that the output of rigid airships would be reduced from 24 per annum, as set out in Paper G.T.-1912, to 15. This wasthe least that the First Sea Lord felt himself able to agree to, although he was of opinion that the need existed for at least 18 instead of 15.Mr. Churchill stated that, in view of the length of time that it took to build these sheds, and the claim on plates and labour,which vitally affected the supply for other purposes, he would liketo discuss this matter with General Smuts and the Admiralty.The War Cabinet therefore decided That the subject should be considered by the Committee under General Smuts, appointed under Minute 6, who would report thereon.Air Effort of the 9- The Minister of Munitions related briefly to the War cabinet united States of the efforts which were being made by Major Boiling, of the UnitedAmerica. States Army, to place the air organisation of the United States on a sound footing, so that they might take part in the offensive next summer. Mr. Churchill added that they were rendering con-siderable assistance in the development of the French Air Services.The War Cabinet recpuested Mr. Churchill to call upon Sir William Weir to prepare a paper on the American effort in this direction, and to submit it for the information of the War Cabinet.Coal for Italy. 10. The Director of Transports stated that the Secretary ofState for War had conveyed to the Shipping controller a message from General Cadorna emphasising the supreme necessity ofincreasing the supply of coal to Italy, even at the expense ofmunitions and other necessaries. The Shipping Controller had therefore issued instructions that an effort should be made to bring up the supply to 700,000 tons a-month.Lord Derby confirmed the importance of coal to Italy, and thought that pressure ought to be put on the Italians to supplyescorts for coal shipments. There were a number of destroyers inVenice which it ought to be possible to spare for this purpose.It was pointed out thati Lord Milner&apos;s Committee had laid stress on the necessity of Italian protection being furnished forthrough traffic in the Mediterranean (Appendix II).The War Cabinet decided that The negotiations with the Italian Government for an increasedsupply of coal should proceed on the basis that they would furnish an escort of destroyers.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,September 21, 1917.
APPENDIX I.Italian Offensive.Paraphrase portion of telegram from General Delme&apos;-Badcliffe to the Chief of theImperial War Staff, dated September 20, 1917.CADORNA told me to-day that in view of the situation in Russia, of indications that Austrians were intending to take offensive north of Gorizia, of the arrival onJulian front of four fresh Austrian divisions, and reports that further strongreinforcements were approaching, he has deemed it prudent not to undertake anotheroffensive on a great scale, but to wait for Austrian offensive and to follow it up with a counter-attack. For this decision, he said, there were many reasons. He mentioned,for example, the civil Governments z-eluctance to proceed energetically with recruiting and the resulting difficult\r of obtaining enough drafts. Between 25,000 and 30,000were killed in the last offensive, and there were in all about 120,000 casualties, a largeproportion of which, however, were slightly w^ounded. A large-scale offensive withcasualties which might run to 300,000, if not entirely successful, would have bad effect on the country&apos;s moral, and he (Cadorna) would find himself, if the enemybrought further reinforcements from the Russian front, in a difficult position. Hiswisest course, he therefore considers, is, for the present, to act on the defensive andaccording to circumstances, preparing in any case for an energetic spring campaignwith a largely increased reserve of ammunition. He proposes to. withdraw from thefront line and send to training camps as many troops as can be spared and to give asmuch leave as possible.APPENDIX n.Coal fok Italy.(See War Cabinet 231, Minute 10, G.T.-2059.)Paraphrase of telegram sent to Foreign Office for transmission to the ItalianGovernment.WITH reference to coal shipments, it is hoped to raise September exports so asto make average for August and September about 000,000 tons, exclusive of quantitysent by America. Future supplies must depend on what protecting forces Italy canfurnish. In order to protect through traffic from Gibraltar to Port Said, Italianco-operation necessary. Need eleven Italian destroyers as part of the anti-submarineforces to be worked under the Commander-in-Chiefs control. Can only save tonnage for Italian coal supplies by putting traffic through the Mediterranean. As stated inrecent negotiations, it is essential that the neutral vessels chartered by Italy and the few Italian vessels now taking coal to Blaye should be sent for ore to- North Spain.As the next few weeks are the best for loading ore before bad weather sets in, it isimportant that orders to this effect should be given immediately.If Italy takes action set out above, we will do utmost to ship up to the highest possible figure from United Kingdom, but to attempt exact statement is undesirable,as shipments depend largely on tonnage controlled by Italy. A precise estimate isalso impracticable because of the many uncertain factors in the tonnage position.o
