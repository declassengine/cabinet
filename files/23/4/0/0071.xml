The food situation :Finance.Meat and Cheese.Imports of Tea.Protection ofLabour.accommodation and Staff for theMinistry of Food.1. THE War Cabinet resumed the discussion of the food situation adjourned from yesterday&apos;s Meeting (War Cabinet 296,Minute 15), with special reference to Lord Rhondda&apos;s Memorandum(Paper G.-180).The Prime Minister announced that the details of the financialarrangement come to with the American representatives yesterdaymorning would be settled at a Conference that afternoon.TheTheWar Cabinet decided to request Shipping Controller to give absolute priority to the FoodController&apos;s requirements for tonnage necessary to carry outthe programme of food imports.2. With reference to War Cabinet 283, Minute 12, dealing withthe proposed transfer of the organisation for the purchase of meat and cheese from the Board of Trade to the Ministry of Food, theWar Cabinet were informed that the attempts to settle the matter had so far been unsuccessful.Mr. Long said it was important to bear in mind the Dominions&apos;point of view, and suggested that Sir Thomas McKenzie should be consulted.The War Cabinet decided to ask Lord Milner and Mr. Barnes to go into the matter that afternoon, and, if they failed to come to a final decision, tobring up the matter before the Cabinet to-morrow.3. Lord Rhondda stated that the shortage of tea was an acutecause of popular discontent, which could be remedied by a relatively small expenditure of tonnage, and he would like the Shipping- Controller to be authorised to provide tonnage sufficient to raise atonce the stock in bond to 60,000,000 lb. after the grocers&apos; stocks hadbeen replenished. Further, the restriction on the importation ofJava and China tea should be removed.Mr. Long said that he understood that twelve liners were being diverted from the East to the Atlantic in order to bring corn to thiscountry.Lord Derby stated that, under pressure from the ShippingController, he had undertaken not to recruit the full number of chinese coolies. In that way about 100,000 tops of shipping wouldbe saved between Vancouver and China, provided that France alsostopped recruiting in China.The War Cabinet referred the question to Lord Milner andMr. Barnes for decision that afternoon, in consultation withthe Shipping Controller and Food Controller.4. Lord Rhondda urged that, in the interests of the food supply, it was essential that labour in flour mills and other foodfactories should be protected from military service. At present only temporary exemptions were granted.Sir Auckland Geddes said it was difficult to grant absoluteprotection, but his Department had already negotiated a large measure of protection, and would continue to do everything possibleto meet the wishes of the Food Controller. No serious withdrawalof labour was taking place.5. The War Cabinet instructed The Secretary to communicate to all the Departments concerned that in respect of accommodation, printing, and staff theWar Cabinet considered that the claims of the Ministry ofFood should be treated as being of great urgency.
Inequalities of distribution.agricultural programme and food Production.labour requirements.6. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to theinequality in the distribution of food as between one centre andanother. A deputation which had waited on the Prime Minister onthe previous day had alleged that in some districts there was anentire iack of butter, lard, margarine, and bacon, it was suggestedthat greater use ought to be made of the local authorities in thework of distribution, and the administrative experience of TownClerks and Councillors drawn upon. Further, the Ministry of Foodmight consider the desirability of making the Co-operative Whole-sale Societies and the large private distributing agencies into&quot;controlled establishments&quot; on the analogy of engineering works.Lord Rhondda stated that at Birmingham and other centreslocal experiments were being tried with a view to improvingdistribution and getting rid of queues. - He had set up nearly 2,000local Food Committees, the personnel of which was largely drawn from the local authorities. With regard to local shortages, supple-mentary allowances had been made to a large number of towns, and steps were being taken to organise distribution schemes for bacon,butter, tea, &amp;c, but they would necessarily take some time to put in motion.The War Cabinet decided to ask The Food Controller to prepare a report on the problem of distribution, with special reference to the points raised inthe discussion.7. The War Cabinet resumed the discussion of the agricultural programme begun at the previous days meeting (War Cabinet 295,Minute 16), with special reference to Mr. Prothero&apos;s Memorandum(Paper G.T.-2767).Sir Arthur Lee, in the unavoidable absence of - the President ofthe Board of Agriculture, informed the Cabinet that, at a meetingof Agricultural Commissioners, held the previous day, encouragingreports had been received as to the progress made with the agricul-tural programme. He hoped that at least 80 per cent, of the2,695,000 acres assigned to breadstuffs would be got ready. Thiswould, roughly, be 2,000,000 acres above the 1916 area. No veryreliable estimate could be given of the increased production by smallgrowers, but it was conjectured that there had been an addition of300,000 tons of potatoes, and 300,000 tons of other vegetables fromthat source in 1917, aud it was hoped to increase this total to1,000,0.00 tons in 1918.Mr. Munro dealt with the position in Scotland, where the aimwas to plough by 1918, 350,000 acres above the 1916 area. Of this amount, 50,000 acres had been obtained in 1917. The realisation of the complete programme was contingent on the supply of soldierlabour of good quality, of superphosphates, and of an adequatestaff at the Board of Agriculture.Mr. Duke said -that in Ireland the output in 1917 above that of-1916 had been 1,750,000 tons of potatoes and 536,000 tons ofcereals. The increase in acreage for these crops had been 600,000.In 1918 it was hoped that the increase would be, at least, 1,200,000acres. There were signs that the Sinn Feiners were turning fromactive rebellion to a policy of holding up crops, but, so far, this movement had not been serious except in two counties.8. Sir Arthur Lee said the agricultural programme couldonly be carried out if the urgent minimum requirements specified inthe Memorandum (G.T.-2767) were fully and promptly met. Themost urgent need at the moment was for skilled ploughmen, ofwhom 8,500 in all were required. There were 1,000 in sight fromthe Army in France, and it was hoped to draw 1,000 from german prisoners now iu this country. The Department could place 1,000skilled ploughmen a week, as the horses and harness required were
now in sight. He understood a second 1.000, withdrawn from thearmy in France would soon be available.Mr. Munro said it \\ ould not be possible in Scotland to returnto the army any of the men lent to the farmers. As to additional labour, 1,000 men next spring would suffice. These should be, ifpossible, skilled agriculturists, and in any case they should be able-bodied,Mr. Duke said that there was a constant flow from Ireland offrom 500 to 1,000 labourers weekly, attracted bv high wages on this side. They were, therefore, very near bedrock in Ireland, and hadno skilled ploughmen to spare.Sir Auckland Geddes said . there were perhaps 1,000 skilledploughmen in the New Zealand Reserves, who could, he understood,be loaned for two and a half months. The New Zealand militaryauthorities were willing to lend them on furlough. In Denmarkthere were from 3,000 to 5,000 deserters from the German Army nowout of work. They were natives of Schleswig-Holstein, and among them were some of the best farmers in Europe. The War Office wasraising no objection to their removal, nor was the Foreign Office,subject to the approval of the Danish Government, but itwas necessary to arrange tonnage with the Shipping Controller,and to obtain particulars from the Food Production Department asto the farms to which these men could be sent. They would be under the Alien Restriction Act and Orders, and there would be no necessity to provide guards. In Denmark there were between20,000 and 22,000 unemployed Danes. Probably many of these badhad some experience of the land as small-holders; others were butter and margarine makers. He gathered from the Ministry of labour that there would not be any Trade Union difficulties in connectionwith their employment in agriculture.German Prisoners. 9. Sir Arthur Lee pointed out that it was essential that theW^ar Office and the Prisoners of War Committee should agree to relax the regulations for guarding and accommodating german prisoners, if the maximum advantage was to be obtained from their employment.General Macready said the War Office was quite prepared to-make the necessary relaxations, provided the War Cabinet was prepared to meet the criticism which always arose from the House ofCommons and in the press when a prisoner escaped. Up to thepresent only one officer and two men had got away from thecountry. - 1Lord Derby said he was quite willing that the prisoners should go out in twos and threes to farmers, but it was impossible to havetiny camps all over the country. Surveillance could be left to thelocal police, and weekly reports could be obtained as to the conductof the prisoners.Sir Auckland Geddes urged that there should be an industrialcensus taken of the German prisoners in France and this countrysimilar to that which has been taken in the Home forces, and that,as the ploughmen were discovered, they should be sent in batches tobe employed on the land.Mr. Hope said that as far as the prisoners in the United kingdom were concerned, instructions to this effect had been given months ago by the.Prisoners of War Employment Committee, but theyapparently had not been carried out.The Wax Cabinet decided that (a.) The restrictions affecting German prisoners loaned to farmerscould be relaxed . as far as safely thought possible, thedetails to be arranged by the Departments concerned.(b.) A trade index of the German prisoners should be made, and skilled ploughmen released in batches as discovered.
Tractor transport and Fuel.11. Sir Arthur Lee called attention to the prolonged delayswhich have occurred in the delivery of tractors and other machineryordered by the Department last spring, and to the importance ofproviding adequate supplies of fuel and spare parts for all agricul-tural machinery, whether privately owned or in the hands of theDepartment. Facilities for the provision of steam tackle and additional equipment were also urgently required.Mr. Long said that the oil situation had improved wdthin thelast week and wras now somewhat more secure. He hoped it wouldbe possible to supply all the oil required for agricultural purposes.The War Cabinet instructed The Secretary to call the attention of the Minister of munitions and the Shipping Controller to the position as described by the Director-General of Food Production, and to theimportance of expediting the shipment of machinery from america and of granting the other facilities to manufac-turers of steam tackle and equipment now asked for.Accommodation forthe FoodProductionDepartment.12. Sir Arthur Lee stated that his Department was in urgent need of further staff accommodation of about thirty to forty rooms.He did not press for a braiding in Whitehall, as he knew that theOffice of Works had w-ell-nigh exhausted the possibilities in thatdistrict.The War Cabinet decided that The First Commissioner of Works should be requested toprovide the accommodation referred to as soon as possible,but in his efforts to meet the demands for new accom-modation now being made, should inform Departmentsthat they must be prepared, if necessary, to take officesat some distance from Whitehall.Food Prices in1918.13. The War Cabinet requested The Food Controller to make an announcement at the earliestpossible moment of the official prices for next year&apos;s grain,potatoes, and milk.DepartmentalExpenditure on food Production.14. In response to a request from Sir Arthur Lee to be allowed by the Treasury a reasonable latitude in incurring minor expendi-.ture on the Agricultural Programme, the Chancellor of the exchequer-quer undertook to consider any representations made to him on thesubject.Staff of Board ofAgriculture(Scotland).15. The Chancellor of the Exchequer took note of representa-tions made by Mr. Munro on behalf of the Scottish Board ofAgriculture for an increase of staff.Fertilisers. 10. Sir Arthur Lee stated that the consumption of sulphate of ammonia for munition purposes was now expected to be greaterthan previously contemplated, and that there was a prospectivedeficiency of 40,000 tons in the supplies available for food production.As regards superphosphates, the Cabinet had decided that 50,000tons per month of phosphate rock should be imported into thiscountry for the five months 1st June to 31st October. Only 149,000tons have so far been imported instead of 250,000 tons. Sir ArthurLee pointed out the serious effect of these deficiencies on the futurefood supplies of the country.
Allotments. 16. Dr. Addison called attention to the insecurity felt over thecountry by the men who, in order to increase the food supply, had undertaken the cultivation of small patches of ground under tbeCultivation of Land Act. It was not necessary to raise at this juncture questions of ownership or saleable interests, but only tosafeguard the liberty to cultivate and provide security of tenureduring the war.It was suggested that a public official statement might meetthe case.(No decision was come to.)17. The War Cabinet had before them the following documents : Memorandum by the Food Controller (Paper G.-T. 2861).Second Interim Report of the Committee on the Production andDistribution of Milk (Paper G.T.-2877).Report bv the Food (War) Committee of the Royal Society(Paper G.T.-2899).Notes on Lord Rhondda&apos;s Memorandum by the Chairman of theCommittee on the Production and Distribution of Milk(Paper G.T.-2898).Memorandum on Milk Production in 1918-19, by Major WaldorfAstor (Paper G.T.-2897).Note by the Medical Department of the Board of Education(Paper G.T.-2955).It was pointed out that there were serious objections to theprinciple of subsidising recommended by the Food Controller, anddoubts were thrown on the extent and urgency of the need for cheapmilk, in view of the high wages now so widely prevailing.Mr. Hayes Fisher said he would not object if the scheme were confined to necessitous children, and if suitable machinery was usedto discover them.Major Waldorf Astor said that there was no milk famine atpresent, but there undoubtedly was bad distribution. His Committeewere in favour of any proposal to supply cheap or, if need be, freemilk to necessitous children. They believed that this could bedone by (a.) Empowering the Sanitary Authorities to give, or sellat reduced prices, milk to necessitous children underschool age, the necessary grants being made partly outof Exchequer grants and partly out of local rates;(6.) By the more general feeding of children of school age underthe Provision of Meals Act, if and where this &apos; wasnecessary.Mr. Herbert Fisher said that his Department agreed withMajor Astor&apos;s report.The War Cabinet decided To accept the recommendations of the Committee on theProduction and Distribution of Milk, as set forth above bythe Chairman.Supply of Milk for young Children andMothers.Oat; for Ho.ss.s 18. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum byEngaged in Winter Rhondda (G.T.-2929) in which he expressed his view that not &quot;&apos;;Mv&apos; a single pound of oats should be allowed to racing horses, havingregard to the very grave shortage of cereals with which the countryis threatened.
Shelling of Funchal.Bombing said.19. The First Sea Lord reported that 2 enemy submarines hadshelled Funchal, Madeira, at daybreak on the 12 th instant, 3 personsbeing killed and 17 wounded. Slight damage was done to thetown.20. The First Sea Lord stated that a bombing raid had beencarried out on.the night of the 11-12th on Bruges Lock, 2g tons of bombs being dropped&apos;.   One of our machines is missing.Submarines.21. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that-(a.) A motor-launch ran over an enemy submarine, submergedin the vicinity of the Lizard, on the 12th instant. Thesubmarine rose to the surface and the motor-launchattacked her with gunfire, but was unable to use depth charges owing to having carried away her propeller-shaftand rudder.(6.) Explosions had occurred in the deep mine field in thevicinity of the Folkestone Gate, which indicated thepossible loss of an enemy submarine.Enemy NavalActivity iii theNorth Sea.Attack on aConvov.22. The First Sea Lord reported that information had beenreceived that, on the 12th instant, enemy destroyers had attacked aDanish steamer off Longstone and a fishing vessel off the Tyne, the destroyers being accompanied by an airship. A report has since beenreceived which indicated that it was possible that the enemy vessels were submarines and not destroyers. The presence of an airship was doubtful.23. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that a convoy of 6 ships, of.which 1 was British, 2 Norwegian, 2 Swedish,and 1 Danish, under the escort of the destroyers &quot; Partridge &quot; and&quot; Pellew &quot; and 4 trawlers, had been attacked by 4 enemy destroyersabout 34 miles off the coast of Norway at about 1 p.m. on the12th instant. Full particulars of the action had not yet beenreceived, but it was understood that the &quot;Partridge&quot; had been sunk and that the &quot; Peliew &quot; had reached Norwegian waters, being-towed in by a Norwegian torpedo-boat, her engines being out ofaction. The convoy was stated by the commanding officer of the&quot; Pellew &quot; to have scattered when the attack took place, but no news had yet been received as to whether the convoy had arrived in norwegian ports, although enquiries were being made to that end.The Admiral at Longhope had reported, however, that the convoyhad been destroyed.Lord PJiondda drew attention to the serious effect that allowing a ration of oats to horses engaged in steeplechasing would have uponpublic opinion in the United States of America.On the other hand, it was pointed out that it was impossibleentirely to prevent racing in England if it were allowed to continue in Ireland, where it could not be stopped. It was also stated thathorse-racing is still carried on in Germany.The War Cabinet authorised The Food Controller to issue licences to allow horses engaged infixtures, agreed by the Board of Trade, to receive a ration of oats; the ration to be 15 lb. a day each for a number of horses not exceeding 500, and the period of the ration notto extend beyond the middle of April.
The First Sea Lord indicated that there was a British force-oftwo light cruisers and four destroyers 40 miles off when the actiontook place, also a light cruiser squadron to the southward, but theyhad been unable to intercept the enemy, who had presumablyslipped through during the night.&apos; -     -     - !;As regards the protection of convoys in future, Admiral Jeliicoestated that there were two courses open to us : one was to send the convoys on a far northerly course, so that the enemy would not be.able to take advantage of the dark hours to evade our patrols, butthis would double the length of the voyage ; the other was, to run the risk of having battle cruisers, cruisers or light cruisers in close touch with the convoy. If this latter course were adopted theenemy would obtain information of our movements and wouidundoubtedly concentrate submarines to attack them, and we hadnot a sufficient number of destroyers available to provide the requisite screen. The question was under consideration. The first sea Lord indicated the very slight amount of help in the provisionof destroyers which we might expect to receive from the UnitedStates in the near future.The War Cabinet discussed the question of mentioning the engagement and possible loss, by the First Lord in the statement on shipping matters which he was to make to the House in the afternoon, and decided that As the information at present received was so uncertain, noparticulars should be announced pending fuller data beingforthcoming.The Western Front. 24. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that two more German divisions had been transferred from Flanders to the Cambrai region. He added that the fightingat Bullecourt had been severe. Two attacks had heen made bythe enemy at dawn, after heavy artillery preparafion, but bothattacks had been beaten off with heavy losses to the enemy, only asmall portion of trench being lost by us.The Invasion ofItaly :25. The Chief of tbe Imperial General Staff stated that he hadreceived information from General Plumer tc the effect that theItalian commander was satisfied with the results of the recent fighting on the Italian front.The ItalianCommand.26. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that be hadreceived a telegram from General Foch informing him that theItalians were raising the question of exercising more control overthe French force in Italy, and asking whether he was prepared toadopt the principle of complete Italian command over the Frenchand British contingents. General Robertson read to the WarCabinet the original instructions given to General Plumer.The War Cabinet held the view that, at this stage, it was unnecessary to consider the question, more particularly as GeneralDiaz, who was in command of the Italian troops, was an untriedman; but that if the Italians raised the question at a later date,after the abilities of General Diaz had been proved, the matter wouldbe fully considered.   They therefore authorised . . The Chief of the. Imperial General Staff to inform general foch that the War Cabinet did not at /present - proposeto make any alteration in the existing instructions.
9 WC 2976Palestine.   . .27. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff asked to be informed&apos; &apos; &apos;     -&apos;!&apos;: of the wishes of the War Cabinet in connection with the preparationof a report which he had been asked to make, relative to an advance in- Palestine, based generally on the telegram that;was sent to general allenby in accordance with the Cabinet&apos;s directions (War Cabinet 296,Minute 5).The War Cabinet decided that -The General Staff should submit for consideration a project for for carrying out the following alternative policies:  (a.) Complete the conquest of the whole of Palestine, andhold the country for the remainder of the war.(6.) Continue the advance through Palestine and Syria tothe vicinity of Aleppo, so as permanently to interrupt railway communication with Mesojio-tarnia.For the purposes of (a) Palestine to be considered as embracingthe whole country between Beersheba and Dan.Guns for Italy. 28. With reference to War Cabinet 294, Minute 6, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff informed the War Cabinet that it hadbeen his intention to send from Egypt to General Plumer two batteriesof 6-inch howitzers out of those now in reserve at Alexandria, ashe was of opinion that General Allenby had at his disposal at presentmore howitzers than he had occasion to use.- As the weather on the Western front may be expected in thenear future to prevent any large offensive operations in that quarter,and also bearing in mind the difficulty of providing; the requisiteshipping for the transfer of these batteries from Egypt, and thepossible need of sending them back in the event of an extendedadvance in Palestine, the War Cabinet decided that -Before the military authorities took any action for the removalof these guns, General Allenby should be asked if he willrequire the same in the event of his carrying out further operations.Naval Allied 29. In continuation of War Cabinet 290, Minute 12, the WarCouncil. Cabinet had under further consideration the question of the publica-tiori of an abridged communication in regard to the Naval allied council.---------,     The War Cabinet held the opinion that it was essential that thef p^^cyr^i^JlJ^ik^ Council should have for their assistance andfriW^ W4u^ance *0 their deliberations the services of an experienced naval&apos;-----------------officer, not necessarily of high rank, with the &quot; sea sense,&quot; who was fully acquainted with naval policv and the means by which it wasbest possi Lie to carry out the same.The War Cabinet were averse to the creation of a new and independent body to deal with naval matters only, and desired e^meorganisation that would in any case act as a connecting link betweenthe Military and Naval Councils, in view of the need for co-operationthat frequently arises between the two services in the many opera-tions of war.It was mentioned that the Prime Minister had stated in theHouse of Commons that a British naval representative would beattached to General Wilson, and it was suggested that if we hada representative She French and Italians would also wish toappoint one of their naval officers.The First Lord stated that the Admiralty had proposed to detail the British Naval Liaison Officer in Paris as Liaison Officer between
* K^p2^c^^4 -\jb^y cad^zff^i Gr^4r*^ ythe Admiralty and the^fcter-Allh^-^ Council,  and thatGeneral Wilson had been asked if such a course would be agreeable to him. Sir Uric Geddes added that the Military Council, throughthe Liaison Officer, would be able to acquire any further information or opinion that they might desire. The First Lord pointed out that,from a naval point of view, the efforts, &amp;c, of the Allies were not&apos; comparable to those which prevailed from the military aspect. Inthe main theatre of naval warfare the Americans and ourselves pro-vided the whole of the Allied force which was working under theBritish Admiralty, whilst in the Mediterranean the whole of the allied naval force was under the command of the French Commander-in-Chief. The Allies had arranged that, as a general rule, the meetingsof the Allied Naval Council would be held in London not in France under the presidency of the First Lord of the Admiralty, the per-manent staff being located in London under Admiralty control.The First Sea Lord stated that he had frequent conversations with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, but that they nearly/L^a^^-9v)J&amp;jD aH related to the provision of escort, and he thought it possible thatc4jum^-^ Art^/L-c^^fe^-^^n^cr&quot;j:^^l^C(^ &quot;MrHtajy-) Council needed a shipping expert even------------------- more than a naval expert, except for certain special operations.The War Cabinet requested The First Lord to confer with the First Sea Lord, and to report&quot;officer to the staff of thef^Inter-Allied Military)Council, suchas to^tlie practicabilitY of appointing a suitable naval&apos;*tl oiiic-f r   jing a     associated with the Allied Naval Council.The issue of the abridged statement to the press simultaneously with the other parties to tbe agreement was approved.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,December 13, 1917.o
