He addedthat he was circulating this report for the information, of membersof the War Cabinet.2. The Director of Military Operations stated that Lord Cavanhad arrived in England, and the question arose as to the command of the Expeditionary Force to Italy in case of its strength beingconsiderably increased.The War Cabinet decided that This question was one for the Prime Minister, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for War.
The Western Front. 3. The Director of Military Operations stated that the recentoffensive in Flanders had been quite successful, and that the canadians had gained more than the objectives which they set out totake, and that Passchendaele was now enveloped from the north-west and west. General Maurice indicated on a plan the present situation on the Western Front, as well as the line it was desirable that weshould reach before the termination of the 1917 offensive.Air Offensive. 4. The Director of Military Operations stated that an attemptto bomb an area further to the eastward of saarbrucken had notbeen very successful, as only a few machines were able to find their objective on account of the weather. They had bombed ironfactories and gasworks at Pirmasens. The remainder of the machines returned with their bombs.Palestine. 5.

The Prime Minister brought to the notice of the WarCabinet a copy of a telegram that had been received on the25th September from the Prime Minister of the Australian Common-wealth to the effect that it w7as highly desirable that General Birdwoodshould be placed in the command of the whole of the australian troops, such being the desire of the troops, themselves, and inconsequence the Australian Government urged it for the considera-tion of the War Cabinet.Lord Derby stated that a telegram to this effect had beenreceived through the Colonial Office, and that he had sent the sameto Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig for an expression of his opinion.The latter&apos;s views had recently been received and had been oom-municated to the Colonial Office.In view of this being a request from the Prime Minister of oneof our Dominions, it was felt that the matter must be considered bythe War Cabinet, and the War Cabinet therefore decided that -The matter should be brought up for their consideration at anearly date by the Secretary of State for War, the corre-spondence which has taken place relating thereto being-circulated for their information.
WC 261Air Reorganisation. 10. With reference to War Cabinet 249; Minute 15, Mr. bonar law raised the question as to when it would be possible to intro-duce the Bill relative to the creation of an Air Ministry.General Smuts stated that the Bill had been drafted and was apparently in order, and that the Admiralty had concurred in its provisions.Lord Derby said that the War Office was considering thematter and he hoped to discuss it at a meeting of the Army Councilnext Friday. It was a matter that more particulary concerned theArmy than the Navy, and particularly the General Staff of the Army,and he did not like recommending that the Bill should go forwardwithout first having the advantage of General Sir William Robertson&apos;s opinions.General Smuts fully concurred in this view, as the Army was more particularly affected than the Navy.As Mr. Bonar Law anticipated that he might be asked questions in the House regarding this Bill, either to-day or to-morrow, theWar Cabinet decided that -In such a case the House should be informed that the Bill wasdeferred owing to the absence of the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff on the Continent, and that as soon as his views had been obtained the Bill would be laid before theHouse.The War Cabinet further requested The Air Ministry to circulate the Bill forthwith for their information.Food Situation in 11. With reference to War Cabinet 260, Minute 7, Mr. BalfourFrance and Italy. informed the War Cabinet that, in conjunction with Lord Milner,General Smuts, the President of the Board of Trade, and theShipping Controller, a meeting had been held to consider thetonnage situation, which was very serious, indicating a reduction innest year&apos;s imports of a matter of S.000,000 tons. This shortagewras aggravated by the failure of the French and Italian harvests,and .it was a question of how to meet the demands of the Govern-meuts of those two countries. M. ClementePs view was thatGreat Britain should commit herself to guaranteeing the food supply of France and Italy, and that such food as may he requiredfor this purpose should have a first lien on tonnage, after which m. Clementel proposed that we should inform the United StatesGovernment of the arrangements we have made, and ask them tocome to the assistance of Great Britain in the matter of shipping.Mr. Balfour stated that the Committee had decided to divert asmuch shipping as possible, during the next two months, to providethe French and Italians with food, and that in the interim theCommittee advocated that we should carry on ^negotiations with theUnited States Government with a view to their feeding France inthe future, and for us to make the necessary arrangements tomaintain the requisite supplies for Italy, which country was largelyfed from India. He added that though the French harvest had only recently been gathered, and that therefore there should be noshortage at present, the Committee had been informed that the Frenchare unable, for technical reasons, to thresh their wheat at the presentmoment. Mr. Balfour was of opinion that we must let the UnitedStates Government thoroughly understand that the tonnage question must be settled as a matter of policy ; that it must be on the basis of a compromise between troops, munitions, foodstuffs and other essential supplies; and that it was no use their devoting themselves to troopsif the European supplies were such &apos; that the Allies were unable tocarry on the war ; and that it must be further impressed upon them&apos; that the feeding of the European Allies is the task of all the Allies,including the United States.
Mr. Bonar Law stated that he had seen M. Clementel, who had expressed his views in a - somewhat different sense. M. Clementelhad said that he did not suggest that we should feed France,but that, as we were now endeavouring to arrive at a commonmilitary policy, the first charge on the resources of the Allies shouldbe the provision of sufficient food supplies to the several countries,with a view to keeping alive the population, and that we should share equally in proportion to our needs. Under the existing arrangements Great Britain will, in M. Clementel&apos;s opinion, be far better supplied than France, and if we do not adopt some common action we can hardly expect the United States to pajr as much attention to our demands as we should wish. M. Clementel had added that, whereas the normal French harvest was 9,400,000 tons,the 1917 harvest amounted to only 3,900,000 tons, and stated thatthis was due to the fact that France, in sending so many men intoher army, had sacrificed the food supply of the country for thegeneral good of the Allied cause, and that if such an effort was notrecognised there would be a food revolution in France, and she would go out of the war. M. Clementelhad stated that the FrenchGovernment were prepared to put on their population any foodrestrictions that we might introduce in Great Britain. M. Clementelhad urged upon Mr. Bonar Law that the two Governments should recognise their joint responsibility in this matter, and that theyshould sign the resolution as set out in the Appendix.Lord Milner stated that undoubtedly the French were in more severe straits than we were as regards food supplies, and that thereason for their action in this matter at the jnesent moment was thatafter, in the past, being practically self-supporting as to food supplies, they had just realised that they woidd have to become animporting country, and that they had not the shipping to meet theircarrying requirements. Moreover, the peasants were hoardingwheat, and the question of collecting it and redistributing the sameat a future date was one of enormous difficulty. There was a gooddeal, therefore, to be said for the view that it was sound policy toallow the peasants to hoard, as it would be bad economy to collect the wheat now with the necessity of redistributing part of it for themaintenance of the peasants later on. Lord Milner added that, after making allowance for the diversion of wheat ships to France andItaly during the next two months, we should have in the UnitedKingdom on the 1st February, 1918, fifteen weeks&apos; supply.General Smuts stated that the French were anxious to bind usto a definite arrangement, confirmed in writing, and that if we were so committed and the United States afterwards refused to assist us with shipping, the situation would be most disastrous, and our military effort would be paralysed through the necessity of devotingto essential food supplies shipping which otherwise would canymunitions and raw material. . wThe Prime Minister remarked that if a crisis had arisen in france in this respect it was the duty of that Government to apply, in the firstinstance, the remedies that could be provided at home before asking for our assistance, and if we signed the proposed agreement therewas a danger that such action would not be taken by the French.He was convinced that we must impress on the Americans the gravesituation as regards shipping, and the fact that, to enable the allied countries to be fed, we should have to restrict to a certain extent our military effort in 1918, and that such effort could not be increaseduntil the shipping situation had been restored, and that, in themeantime, they must be prepared, if requisite, to curtail their military effort to meet the material needs of the Allies as a whole.The War Cabinet approved the recommendations of the Com-mittee that (a.) For the next two months certain wheat ships, as may bearranged between the Wheat Commission, the&apos;FoodController, and the Shipping  Controller,  should  be
12. With reference to War Cabinet 245, Minute 18, the WarCabinet had before them a note by the Secretary (Paper G.-164)and also a memorandum by Lord Curzon (Paper G.T.-2406) on thesubject of the Zionist movement.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that he gathered that everyone was now agreed that, from a purelydiplomatic and political point of view, it was desirable that somedeclaration favourable to the aspirations of the Jewish nationalistsshould now be made. The vast majority of Jews in Russia and america, as, indeed, aU over the world, now appeared to be favourable to Zionism. If we could make a declaration favourable to such an ideal, we. should be able to carry on extremely usefulpropaganda both in Russia and America. He gathered that themain arguments still put forward against Zionism were twofold : (a.) That Palestine was inadequate to form a home for either the Jewish or any other people.(b.) The difficulty felt with regard to the future position of jews in Western countries.With regard to the first, he understood that there were con-siderable differences of opinion among experts regarding the possi-bility of the settlement of any large population in Palestine, but hewas informed that, if Palestine were scientifically developed, a verymuch larger population could be sustained than had existed duringthe period of Turkish misrule. As to the meaning of the words&quot; national home,&quot; to which the Zionists attach so much importance,he understood it to mean some form of British, American, or otherprotectorate, under which full facilities would he given to the jews to work out their own salvation and to build up, by means ofeducation, agriculture, and industry, a real centre of national cultureand focus of national life. It did not necessarily involve the earlyestablishment of an independent Jewish State, which was a matter for gradual development in accordance with the ordinary laws ofpolitical evolution.With regard to the second point, he felt that, so far fromZionism hindering the process of assimilation in Western countries,the truer parallel was to be found in the position of an Englishmanwho leaves his country to establish a permanent home in the UnitedStates. In the latter case there was no difficulty in the Englishmanor his children becoming full nationals of the United States, whereas,in the present position of Jewry, the assimilation was often felt tobe incomplete, and any danger of a double aUegiance or non-nationaloutlook would be eliminated.Lord Curzon stated that he admitted the force of the diplomaticarguments in favour of expressing sympathy, and agreed that theThe ZionistMovement.diverted from, the United Kingdom to France and Italy,those Governments being informed by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs of our action in the matter.(&amp;.) The President of the Board of Trade and the ShippingController should prepare a statement as to the shipping situation generally, and its inadequacy to meet thedemands of the Allies.(c.) Sir Albert Stanley should be requested to proceed to theUnited States of America at an early date to urge uponthe United States Government the seriousness of theposition, and ask for their help and co-operation.The view was expressed that it was desirable thatM. Clementel should accompany Sir Albert Stanley.(d.) The Prime Minister should ask Sir Gordon Hewart, the solicitor-General, to take over the duties of the Presidentof the Board of Trade during the absence of the latter.
bulk of tbe Jews held Ziouist rather than anti-Zionist opinions. he added that he did not agree with the attitude taken up by-Mr. Montagu. On the other hand, he could not share the optimisticviews held regarding tbe future of Palestine. These views werenot merely the result of his own personal experiences of travel in that country, but of careful investigations from persons whohad lived for many years in the country. He feared tnat by the suggested declaration we should be raising false expectations whichcould never be realised. He attached great importance to thenecessity of retaining the Christian and Moslem Holy Places inJerusalem and Bethlehem, and, if this were to be effectively done,he did not see how the Jewish people could have a political capital in Palestine. However, he recognised that some expression of sympathy with Jewish aspirations would be a valuable adjunct toour propaganda, though he thought that we should be guardedin the language used in giving expression to such sympathy.The War Cabinet authorised -The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to take a suitable opportunity of making the following declaration of sympathy with tbe Zionist aspirations : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government views with favour theestablishment in Palestine of a national home for theJewish people, and will use its best endeavours tofacilitate the achievement of this object, it beingclearly understood that nothing shall be done whichmay prejudice the civil and religious rights of existingnon-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights andpolitical status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.&quot;2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,October 31, 1917.
