WITH reference to War Cabinet 255, Minute 14, the PrimeMinister stated that the precedents for votes of thanks to the forcesof the Crown pointed to the practice of such motions being-placed upon the paper; thus notice of the form of motion would have tobe given beforehand.In regard to the date, it was suggested that the 31st October,being the anniversary of the first battle of Ypres, would be a mostsuitable date for the vote of thanks. On the other hand, it waspointed out that Monday, the 29th, had been already fixed for thepurpose, and an announcement to this effect had been made inParliament by the Leader of the House. It was also pointed outthat if the vote of thanks were taken on the 31st, the time allotted
for the Vote of Credit would be broken into, and that this Vote of credit could not be postponed beyond Tuesday.The War Cabinet decided that Notice should be given in both Houses of Parliament this afternoon, and that the vote of thanks should be moved onMonday, the 29th October.The Western 2. The&quot;1 Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theFront. French attack, reported in that morning&apos;s newspapers, had been abrilliant success. They had attacked on a front of 8 kilometresand had achieved a depth of 3 kilometres. They had been opposed by eight German divisions, including two Guards divisions, oneof which had come from the Riga front. The quality of theGerman troops opposed to the French had been good, and theGermans had been aware that an attack was imminent.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should send acongratulatory telegram, on behalf of the War Cabinet,to the French President of the Council.The Italian Front. 3. With reference to War Cabinet 255, Minute 3, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff stated that the Italians reported a german army of nine divisions on the Isonzo front, but as far as he could at present ascertain only three German divisions had been identified.An attack by Austro-German troops upon Monte Piana had takenplace, a battalion of German shock troops being utilised. these latter were almost annihilated, and this initial success was reported as likely to prove beneficial to Italian moral.Loss of Zeppelins. 4.

With reference to War Cabinet 255, Minute. 15, the Firstin the Baltic. gea Lord reported the receipt of a telegram from Petrograd statingthat the British submarine &quot; C. 32 &quot; had been missing for eight days on the 16th instant, and it was feared she was lost in the gulf of Riga; the &quot; C. 26 &quot; is laid up at Pernau in a damaged condition ;a the &quot; C. 27 &quot; reports having fired two torpedoes at a GermanDreadnought, but missed with both.

Dardanelles 9. The Secretary was authorised to inform the Secretary of theCommission: Dardanelles Commission that the War Cabinet approved his proposalSecond Report,        that the following documents should be placed in the custody of theSecretary of the War Cabinet: (a.) A complete copy of everything which was laid before theCommission.(6.) Ten copies of the revised Summary of Evidence.In regard to the publication of this Report, the Secretary of theCommission had mentioned that the Report would probably be delivered to the Home Secretary within three weeks.The view was generally expressed that it would not be in thepublic interest to repeat the experiences following the publication ofthe First Report of the Dardanelles Commission and the Report ofthe Mesopotamia Commission.On the other hand, it was pointed out that Irish troops were engaged in Suvla Bay, and that Irish Members of Parliament seemedanxious for the publication of the circumstances attending this operation, while the part played by Australian and New Zealandtroops in Gallipoli made it necessary that careful consideration should be given before any decision was taken as to the suspension of the publication of the Report. It was thought that parliament might be willing to agree to the postponement of publication until after the war. -The Secretary of State for War strongly urged that no pubbca-tion of the Report should take place at present.At this point the matter was adjourned for further consideration.Proposed Summary 10. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumof War Work. by Lord Curzon in regard to a compilation of a record of the waractivities and accomplishments of the period since the present government assumed office in December 1916 (Paper G.T.-2339).Lord Curzon said that the issue of this Summary of War work at a moment when the session will have run two-thirds of its course and the Government may conceivably be in troubled waters wouldbe more likely to be effective than would be a premature appear-ance now.It was generally agreed that the work of compilation should be proceeded with as quickly as possible, in order that the documentmight be ready, if required, before the 9th December.The War Cabinet decided that (a.)  Lord Curzon&apos;s Memorandum should  be adopted as a tentative framework for the report.(6.) The task of compilation should be proceeded with imme-diately by the Prime Ministers secretariat at 10, downing street, in concert with the various Government Depart-ments.Air Policy. 11. With reference to War Cabinet 249, Minute 15, the WarCabinet had before them a copy of the minutes of the first meetingof the Air Policy Committee (Paper G.T.-2340), (Appendix), with covering note by General Smuts, the chairman of the Committee.The War Cabinet decided that The report should be adopted.Handley-Page machines had been recently withdrawn for bombing operations on German towns. Steps, however, had been taken toadopt other methods for dealing with enemy submarines in this area.
Soldiers&apos; 12. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byDependants. Mr. Barnes (Paper C.T.-2346) in regard to the treatment of wives and dependants of soldiers, during the period in which such wives and dependants were being institutionally treated, by stoppage of allowance by the War Office and Admiralty (War Cabinet 232,Minute 8).By War Cabinet 235, Minute 12, the Minister of Pensions was directed to convene a Committee, to consist of the representatives ofthe Departments concerned, with a view to the presentation of areport. The Committee have come to the conclusion that there wasno serious deficiency of accommodation for the institutional treatmentof dependants of soldiers or sailors or pensioners. The committee recommend that the existing system of the stoppage of the sepai-ationallowance during treatment in a rate-aided institution should be modified so as to provide (a.) For the continuance at the usual rate of the separationallowance, notwithstanding the admission to such an institution of a dependant other than a soldier or sailor&apos;swife.(b.) For the payment by the Local War Pensions Committee,subject to conditions, of an allowance in lieu of, but atthe same rate as separation allowance during, the institutional treatment of soldiers&apos; or sailors&apos; wives.(c.) The existing system of administration of pensions duringtreatment in a rate-aided institution should be modified so far as to provide for the suspension of payment ofpension to a soldier&apos;s widow, subject to the condition that an allowance of equal amount should be adminis-tered by the Local War Pensions Committee for herbenefit.The War Cabinet decided To adopt the above recommendations.Meat and Cheese. 13. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by lord rhondda (Paper G.T.-23M) and a Note by Sir Albert Stanley(Paper G.T.-2364) in regard to the proposed transfer of theorganisation for the purchase&apos; of meat and cheese from the Board ofTrade to the Ministry of Food.Lord Rhondda said that the Board of Trade offered no objec-tions to the transfer of their functions in connection with thepurchase of meat and cheese to the Food Controller. The Presidentof the Board of Trade, however, stated in his Memorandum that hecould not agree to transfer to the Ministry of Food certain membersof the permanent Board of Trade staff who have been engaged insupervising the operations of the meat purchasing organisation.In the course of the discussion it became apparent that therewas a considerable difference of opinion between the departments in regard to the responsibility for the personnel. In these circum-stances, and pending fuller investigation, no immediate decision could be reached, and the War Cabinet therefore asked Lord Milner and Mr. Barnes to examine the facts with the FoodController and the Secretaiy of State for War, and reportto the War Cabinet. &apos;:2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,October 24, 1917.
WC 256APPENDIX.G.T.-2340 --Air Policy Committee.(War Cabinet 249, Minute 15.)THE Air Policy Committee held their first meeting on Tuesday, the I6th October,1917, and I append, for the information of my colleagues and for the approval of theWar Cabinet, a copy of the Minutes of the Meeting.The Committee further recommend that Major Storr, Assistant Secretary to theWar Cabinet, be appointed Secretary to the Committee.All decisions reached, and recommendations made, by the Committee will be circulated to the Cabinet.(Initialled) J. C. S.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,October 19, 1917.The Chairman briefly outlined what he conceived to be the functions of the&apos; Committee.   He said that, at the meeting of the War Cabinet held the previous day,it had been decided that a Committee composed as under should be appointed, to assemble at once, to advise the War Cabinet on all questions relating to Air Policy : General Smuts (Chairman).First Lord of the Admiralty.The Secretary of State for War.The President of the Air Board.A Secretary to be appointed by the Chairman. In his view, the Committee shouldbe attended and advised by the First Sea Lord and members of the Board of Admiraltyconcerned with air questions, Chief of theTmperial General Staff, Director-General ofMilitary Aeronautics, and Sir David Henderson. The Committee had to consider theclaims of the Navy and Army respectively in regard to the output of aircraft and thequestion of an independent air offensive or long-range bombing operations conductedunder the direction, in the first instance, of the Committee. The War Cabinet had accepted the principle of an Air Ministry, but in the interval before this Ministry began to function a Committee to the War Cabinet, coinjjosed of the Heads of the chiefDepartments concerned, together with their Chiefs of Staff and principal air experts,was necessary in order to decide questions of policy. The Committee would deal withall questions of air policy, that is to say, the distribution of aircraft as well as independent air operations. Their first duty at present was to decide what the offensive air policy was to be in the immediate future. The WTar Cabinet desired that immediate arrangements should be made for the conduct of long-range offensive operations against German towns where factories existed for the production ofmunitions of war of all kinds. Consequently, what was required was not only a naval air Force and an Army Air Force, but also a force for an independent air offensive.This independent offensive might be conducted on land from the Western front, andan offensive might also be conducted by the Navy from the North Sea.In view of the War Cabinet decision that long-range aerial operations should beat once carried out against German towns in which munition factories were situated,the immediate duty of the Committee avas to determine the objective, the composition of the force to be employed, and the commander to take charge of the expedition.Sir Eric Geddes said that he understood that the appointment of the Committeewas, in fact, an interim arrangement to formulate an air policy until the Air Ministrycame into being. The immediate operations which the Committee was called upon to direct were all of a purely military character. In order to get the best results and thefullest co-operation, he submitted that the Navy should have its full say in regard tothe activities of any joint independent force from whatever base it might operate. he informed the Committee that the Navy hoped, very shortly, to be able to undertakeoperations of considerable magnitude by the Fleet.It Avas pointed out that the Navy was fully represented on the Committee, andthat, consequently, naval interests were properly safeguarded.
Admiral Jellicoe said that he understood that the function of the independent airforce was to bomb munition factories and war industrial centres far behind the hostilelines on the Western front ; he hoped submarine factories would not be neglected.With regard to the immediate operations in view, he suggested that ,f;he forceconducting them should be called a &quot;joint force&quot; composed of Army and Navyaircraft.Lord Cowdray was of opinion that the Committee would have to be a permanentCommittee even after an Air Ministry had been established, as they would have todetermine how aircraft, when completed, should be allotted either to the Army or theNavy. So far as the present war was concerned they would have to determine the objectives of the independent air force.Lord Derby thought that it would be necessary to distinguish between purely military and naval objectives and objectives which were mainly political. He would prefer to have operations of a purely military or naval character carried out under thedirection of the Commander of the Grand Fleet or Sir Douglas Haig, while independentoperations under a separate Commander might be controlled by the Committee.Sir William Robertson concurred in the view that the Committee was a body which should act until the Air Ministry was formed, and deal with all questions of air policy.   The Committee was, in fact, the Air Ministry in its chrysalis stage.It was suggested that it was desirable to allocate one afternoon a week, whichshould be kept free by members of the Committee for their meetings even if the-Committee might not find it necessary to meet regularly every week.The Chairman stated that, as the Committee was an important Committee of theWar Cabinet dealing with questions of policy, he thought that their decisions shouldbe regularly communicated to members of the War Cabinet.The Committee arrived at the following decisions : (1.) That their functions were to deal with air policy generally as affecting boththe Navy and the Army and as concerned with the conduct of independentaerial operations.(2.) That, as regards aerial operations on our Western front, these should be under a separate air commander under the command of the Field-marshal commanding-in-Chief in France, and that where possible naval machinesshould be detached to co-operate with the military aircraft.(3.) That the First Sea Lord and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff andSir David Henderson should consult together and submit names to theCommittee at their next meeting to enable the Committee to select an aircommander for the independent offensive on the Western front.(4.) That Sir David Henderson should prepare and lay before the Committee attheir next meeting a general review of the situation in regard to theproposed aerial offensive, indicating the scope of our programme of construction and the progress that has been made towards the completionof that programme.(5.) That the question of a policy of long-range offensive to be carried out by a naval force from the North Sea and of the command of that force should beleft for future discussion.
