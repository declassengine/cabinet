The Western Front, 1. THE Director of Military Intelligence reported that theGermans had relieved themselves from French pressure by retiringto a strong position. This retirement might, perhaps, enable theGermans to release four divisions for service elsewhere.The Invasion of 2. The Director of  Military Intelligence   read   a   telegramItaly- received   from   General   Delme-Radcliffe,  No.   558,   dated  the3rd November, 1917, in which it was reported that, the enemy had&apos; attacked the line of the Tagliamento near Gsoppo, opposite theGeorgio detachment, and had crossed the Tagliamento in somestrength above that detachment, driving the latter back. Itwas probable, therefore, that more enemy troops were crossing the Tagliamento and were following up the . retirement ofthe Second Army, which has probably little power of resistance. A general retirement of the Second and ThirdArmies . towards the Piave had been ordered. The ItalianGeneral Staff hoped that it would be possible to make the retire-ment in good order, place the Piave between the Italian Army andthe enemy, and. so gain time for re-forming and resting the italian army to some extent. General Delme-Radcliffe added that the- Army showed signs of recovering its moral, but it remains to beseen whether the enemy will give it time to recover sufficiently toremain a useful factor in the war.In a later message General Delme-Radcliffe reported that theThird Army was still holding a line on the Tagliamento and wasrecovering its moral. A counter-attack had been made by theItalians, showing that they wrero regaining their offensive spirit.The whole of the Second Army was to be reorganised, and order was being restored, as far as possible, behind the present front. - Itwas expected that there would be in all some 220 battalions that could be used for the defence of the Piave line.With regard to the probability of attack on the Trentino front,the Director of Military intelligence said that he had communicated with the head of the French Second Bureau in Paris, who had reported that there were no definite indications of an enemyconcentration in the Trentino.Palestine. 3. The Director of Military Intelligence reported the receipt ofa message from General Allenby to the effect that the enemy were offering resistance in the broken country north of Beersheba on theenemy&apos;s left.The bombardment of Gaza was still going on. A report, atpresent unconfirmed, had been received that the enemy werebringing up two or three divisions by the Hebron road, and thatGeneral Falkenhayn himself had assumed charge of the operations in Palestine.General Allenby reported that during the operations up to the night of the 3rd/4th November he had captured 207 officers and2,429 other ranks, together with 15 guns.Mesopotamia. 4 The Director of Military Intelligence reported that GeneralMaude had telegraphed that he had pushed up the right bank of the tigris, with a flank guard on the left bank, and had attacked theenemy 20 miles north of Samara. The enemy had evamiated hisposition. We had captured 89 prisoners and 4 ammunition dumps.Our casualties had amounted to 180. A reconnaissance of Tekrithad also been made.
Russia. 5. The Military Attache at Petrograd reported that there was great difficulty in feeding the Army. Supplies at Petrograd arevery short, and there was said to be only one day&apos;s reserve offorage.salonica. 6. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that informa-tion had been received to the effect that the Bulgarians had been reinforced by 18 battalions from Roumania. He said that he wishedto let the Cabinet know that there were rumours that an attack bythe enemy on the Salonica front was possible, though there were no signs yet of any concentration of enemy troops beyond that already mentioned. The French think the Germans will not press theiroffensive in Italy, but are more likely to attack at Salonica. Therumour of such an attack appears to be based on possibilities ratherthan upon any exact information. For instance, the enemy knowsthat the Taranto route is Clocked, and that the Serbians, Russians,and Italians are considerably shaken in spirit.In this connection Lord Milner pointed out that the recentpolicy of the Germans had been, like that of Frederick the Great,wdien not sufficiently strong to follow up a blow, to strike now here,now there, first at one country, then at another, not with the objectof giving a knock-out blow, but always with that of great political effect. If now, after their present attack, the Germans were toleave Italy and turn to Salonica, they would only be continuing thepolicy which they had already followed in their attacks on roumania and Russia.The War Cabinet were reminded that, as a precaution in caseof emergency, it had been decided (War Cabinet 237, Minute 5) tokeep a reserve &quot;of transports in readiness to remove one and a halfdivisions from Marseilles if required.The First Sea Lord said that there were already six transportswaiting at Marseilles, and there would be more in the near future.The War Cabinet decided that In view of the fact that the whole military situation was nowbeing discussed at the Conference in Italy, the Director ofMilitary Intelligence should telegraph to the Chief of theImperial General Staff giving him information in regardto the rumour of a possible enemy attack on the Salonicafront.Egypt- 7. The Director of Military Intelligence reported the receipt, ofa telegram from Sir Reginald Wingate to the effect that GeneralClayton recommended that the Arab Legion, numbering about 1,000men, now in Egypt, should be sent to Akaba to assist Faisal&apos;s action.The Director of Military Intelligence said that it would be necessaryto considt the French, and he had therefore wired to Paris, and alsoto General Allenby, to ask what they recommended in regard to theproposal. .Submarines. 8. The First Sea Lord said that (a.) Queenstown reported that the armed trawler &quot; Sarba &quot;dropped a depth charge on a thick patch of oil, t\ milesfrom Daunt Rock Lightship, on the 31st October. Theposition had now been examined by divers and a largesubmarine found lying on its side.(b.) A report had been received from St. Vincent that a submarine had entered the port at 8&apos;30 a.u. on the2nd November, and torpedoed at close range twoBrazilian steamships at anchor, and then went out.She was fired at by the forts and a gunboat, butapparently without effect.B 2[1365 265]
(c.) The Commander-io-Chief at Portsmouth reported that theGerman submarine &quot;TIC. (55&quot; had been torpedoed by submarine &quot; C. 15 &quot; at 3 30 i&apos;.M. on the 3rd November,16-1 miles off Beachy Head. Two officers and threemen were taken prisoners.British Submarines 9. With reference to War Cabinet 260, Minute 5, the Navalin the Baltic. Liaison Officer at Petrograd telegraphed that the &quot;C&apos;26 &quot; reportedan attempted attack on two &quot; Konigs &quot; on the 17th October, butgrounded in 20 feet of water. She had been pumped out to get off,but she broke surface and had to submerge again immediately.She grounded again and proceeded to Pernau. She then proceededout on the 24th October, but had to return after six hours owing tofuel tanks leaking as the result of grounding.Bombing Raids. 10. The First Sea Lord stated that reports had been receivedfrom Dunkirk that a bombing raid had been carried out on theafternooon of the 4th November on Engel Aerodrome. Bombs fellamong sheds and hangars on the Aerodrome.A large number of patrols were also carried out. During one,a 2-seater Albatross was brought down into the sea, and another2-seater driven down damaged ; in addition, one scout had beenprobably destroyed.11. The First Sea Lord said that the Vice-Admiral at Doverreported that an electrically-controlled motor-boat, accompanied by19 aeroplanes, had attacked the Monitor &quot; Prince Eugene &quot; on the morning of the 3rd November, off the Belgian coast Theelectrically-controlled motor-boat was sunk by gunfire from a destroyer, and the &quot; Prince Eugene &quot; was not hit.It was suggested that, in view of statements made in the pressregarding this boat, it would be desirable to communicate some more detailed information on the subject.The First Sea Lord undertook to ascertain if there would beany objection to such publication.Ireland. 12. With reference to War Cabinet 264, Minute 1, the chief secretary for Ireland stated that, as the result of a confidentialcommunication recehed on Thursday last, he had, after consultationwith the Prime Minister and Lord Milner, crossed to Dublin that night. In Dublin he had conferred with the civil and militaryauthorities concerned, and had agreed with them upon a certaincourse of action. The fears which had been entertained had cometo nothing, and both in Dublin and elsewhere no untoward occur-rences had taken place on Sunday. The meeting to be addressed by Mr. de Valera on Sunday afternoon at Newbridge had beenproclaimed, and although Mr. de Valera had proceeded to the districton Saturday night the meeting did not take place. He wished toemphasise the fact that there had been leakage of information,both in England and Ireland, which had had somewhat unfortunate results. He was investigating the means whereby this leakage hadtaken place, and would report to the Cabinet at an early date. Onthe whole he was of the opinion that Sinn Fein had received aconsiderable shock, and that there was1 a growing realisation inIreland, both among the Sinn Feiners and others, that the Govern-ment were resolved to stand firm, and, if necessary, use the requisite-force to carry out the decisions of the executive. He reported thaton Saturday the &quot; Irish Independent &quot; had issued a striking warning to the Sinn Feiners, and that the &apos;&quot;&apos; Freeman&apos;s Journal,&quot; which hadGermanElectricallyControlled MotorBoat.
been behaving atrociously in the past few weeks, showed signsof returning to its senses.Attention was drawn to the fact that the stoppage of leave to officers and men in. the United Kingdom during the movement oftroops to and from Ireland had given rise to a good deal of rumour.In this connection Field-Marshal Lord French and Lord Derbypointed outthat such a stoppage of leave was absolutely essentialon military grounds, and that, the period of movement now being over, the leave was being allowed as heretofore.Lord French reported that, in regard to the unit most concernedwith the recent loss of rifles, this unit had paraded for embarkationwith only two absentees, which, pointed to the fact that the loyaltyand discipline of the unit were not seriously affected, and the lossof arms could not be attributed to treacherous or seditious action.Air Organisation 13. The War Cabinet decided that In the absence of General Smuts, Lord Milner be recprested toact as Chairman of the Air Organisation Committee.Grant of Money tothe King of the hejaz.14. Lord Milner drew attention to the request that had beenreceived, through Sir Reginald Wingate, from the King of the Hejazfor an increase in the money advanced to him. in view of theoperations in Palestine and the need of doing everything possible atthe moment to encourage the Arab movement and Arab co-operation against the Turk, the War Cabinet authorised the grant of theincreased amount.Publication of committees and reports on -ReconstructionQuestions.lo. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Reconstruction (Paper G.T.-2110), and decided that The question of publication should be left to the discretion of dr. Addison.Reports ofDepartmentalCommitteesappointed by theBoard of Trade.16. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the -Board of Trade (Paper G.T.-2329), and decidedthat The question of the publication of these reports or of extractsoi&quot; summaries should be left for decision to the Presidentof the Board of Trade, acting in consultation with theMinister of Reconstruction.Reorganisation of 17. The  War  Cabinet   considered   a   Memorandum   by thethe Hoard of Trade.   President of the Board of Trade (Paper 0.-1(53), together with aMemorandum thereon by Dr. Addison (Paper G.-1(39).Sir Albert Stanley pointed out that the matter was almostentirely one which could be dealt with internally by the Board ofTrade under the powers already conferred upon it, but that, inview of the recent appointment of Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland to an office which was partly under the Board of Trade and partly underthe Foreign Office, it was desirable that the Cabinet should take note of the proposed reorganisation. Briefly, it was intended to divide the Board of Trade into two Departments, under one Minister,namely : (1.) Commerce and industry and the encouragement of trade:(2.) The regulation of industry, public services, and control.The War Cabinet approved the proposed form of organisation,subject to the concurrence of the Foreign Office and the Treasury.** Tbis decision is not to ba taken as prejudicing- any future reallocation of functions which may be found to be necessary in the public interest.
The FinancialBlockade.18. With reference to War Cabinet 247, Minute 8, the WarCabinet considered the First Interim Report of Sir Edward Carson&apos;sCommittee on the Economic Offensive, dealing with the question ofestablishing a financial blockade.It was pointed out that the forthcoming presence of theAmerican representative, Mr. Crosby, in this country woidd afford a good opportunity for pressing the United States Government onthis subject.The War Cabinet approved the Interim Report, and authorisedevery possible step being taken to secure &apos;the promptco-operation of the other Allies, and more particularly ofthe United States.Imports andExportsEestrictions Bill,and Non-ferrous metals Bill.19. The War Cabinet further considered Interim reports nos. 2 and 3 of Sir Edward Carson&apos;s Committee on the economic offensive, recommending the introduction and passage into law ofthe Imports and Exports Restrictions Bill and of the Non-ferrous metals Bill.Sir Edward Carson, as Chairman of the Committee, explainedthat the Committee considered these measures of the first importance and urgency, and suggested that their introduction in the House ofCommons might afford a convenient opportunity for a general statement of our policy in the matter of an Economic 1 !ffensive.It was also suggested that a similar statement on the part ofthe United States would immensely strengthen the effect of our owndeclaration.The War Cabinet approved of the proposal to introduce the bills in question as soon as possible, the actual date oftheir introduction to be settled in consultation with the leader of the House of Commons.(Initialled) A.
