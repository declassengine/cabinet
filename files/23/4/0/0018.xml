THE War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by LordPulse Requisition Rbondda (Paper G.T.-2I33) calling attention to the serious positionOrder, resulting from a recent decision of the High Court as to the effectof the Orders under which beans had been requisitioned and dealtwith by the Wheat Commission.Briefly the alternatives were :  (a.) To act upon the High Courts decision, which means thatthe Wheat Commission will have to pay over to each ofthe persons who speculated in the beans the profit ofsuch speculation.(6.) To introduce a Bill in Parliament validating the Orders asmade.
Lord Rhondda in his Memorandum pressed for the adoption ofthe second course.The War Cabinet instructed The Secretary to write a letter to the Law Officers intimatingto them that the War Cabinet understood that a numberof acts of doubtful legality were being done under theDefence of the Realm Regulations. In particular, theFood Controller had asked for a decision in regard to thecase of requisitioning beans, peas, and pulse, and theWar Cabinet would like to be advised regarding the scope and nature of any legislation that should be introduced into Parliament for the purpose not only of giving effectto the Food Controller^ proposals, but also of legalisingother action of doubtful legality taken in the past or to betaken in the future.2. The War Cabinet discussed with General Trenchard thevarious points raised in connection with our Air Offensive duringthe meeting held the same morning (War Cabinet 243, Minute 13).The Chief of the Imperial General Staff gave particulars as tothe objectives to be bombed, and the different types of machineswhich it was proposed to use. Arrangements would be made withthe French, as soon as possible, for the detachment of two Britishsquadrons, one for night and one for day flying, to a point behind the French Front convenient for attacking suitable objectives, suchas the Lorraine iron-works, and, when conditions were favourable,Mannheim and Stuttgart. To assist in these operations, eightHandley-Page aeroplanes, with pilots, for night work, would besupplied by the Admiralty. Four of these should be ready on the10th instant, and the remaining four about the 20th instant.Twenty machines, previously destined for Russia, would be ready in the next 20 days, and 20 more machines from the same source ofsupply in five or six weeks.General Trenchard said that the machines would go to an aerodrome already prepared at Ouchy, near Nancy. It was expectedthat our machines would be ready to take the offensive six days after arrival at the aerodrome, provided that the weather was suit-able. Colonel Newall would be in,command. It was uncertain whether the French would co-operate in the offensive or not.In connection, with this forthcoming offensive, reference wasmade to the great and growing demand on the part of the Britishpttblic for retaliation.The War Cabinet approved the arrangements outlined above inregard to machines and objectives, and the Prime Ministerimpressed on General Trenchard the importance of makinga success of the forthcoming air offensive, having regardto the effect that such a success Avould&apos; have on the moral of the people at home.3. With reference to War Cabinet 242, Minute 5, the WarCabinet had before them the Secretary&apos;s telegram to the chief secretary to the. Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and Mr. Duke&apos;s reply(Paper G.T.-2i73), together with a second telegram from Mr. Duke,dated the 2nd October, 1917, pointing out that a further hunger-strike would probably take place, perhaps that day, on the prisonersputting forward a demand to fix their own conditions as to treatment,on the basis that they are political prisoners. Mr. Duke consideredtheir continued detention important, and stated that forcible feeding-was strongly condemned by medical witnesses of great credit at the
inquest on Thomas Ashe, and suggested possible alternatives withregard to their future treatment, namely : (a.) To allow hunger-strike and possible self - starvation^releasing men one by one whose state becomesdangerous.(b.) To feed forcibly and incur medical risks.-(c.) To remove certain ringleaders to some prison elsewhere,perhaps in England, so as to deal more easily withremainder.(d.) To use no restraint beyond detention, and no penal treat-ment, merely detaining in prison for safe custody.(e.) To discharge from prison and remove out of Ireland under those Defence of the Realm Regulations which permitrestriction on place of residence, or to make new defence Regulations to provide for the internment ofpersons promoting armed rebellion.The Home Secretary reported that he had ascertained from theIrish Office that the prisoners were all committed for offences againstthe Defence of the Realm Regulations, such as wearing uniform and drilling. The number of prisoners was ascertained to be forty.Sir George Cave added that there was no such thing as a &quot; politicalprisoner&quot; known to English Law, and that, apart from persons convicted of offences such as contempt of court, &amp;o., only two recentcases, viz., those of Mr Stead and the Jameson raiders, had been treated as first-class misdemeanants. He read paragraph 243 (ra)of the Prison Regulations,.which laid down the most lenient form oftreatment possible, consistent with discipline, in our prison system.A circular was read that had been published iu Limerick,inciting the populace to avenge the so-called murder of ThomasAshe, and generally incensing the populace against the Government.Sir Edward Carson read a letter which he had received from ireland, setting forth at some length the present feeling in Irelandand the attitude of the people towards the Government. This letterlaid emphasis on the fact that the true condition of the country was largely veiled for fear of giving an impression of disunion to foreignreaders, and that the only information which the British publicreceived through the newspapers was either censored accounts ofSinn Fein meetings or else articles by Mr. Austin Harrison. Thelatter appeared to be doing a good deal of harm. No attempt wasmade to explain Government action, or to support their action, inthe Irish press.It was pointed cut that the Chief Secretary to the lord lieutenant of Ireland was very much under-staffed at present,particularly in London.Attention was also drawn to the position of the Chief secretary in regard to expenditure xrpon works of repair and development, andin this connection the Chancellor of the Exchequer intimated that hewas having enquiries made at the Treasury in regard to this matter.The War Cabinet decided that Certain ringleadears among the Sinn Fein prisoners should beremoved to prisons in England, and that all Sinn Feinprisoners, both in Ireland and England, should be treated in accordance with Rule 243 (a) of the Prison Regulations.The Secretary was instructed to telegraph this decision to theChief Secretary for Ireland forthwith.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,October 3, 1917.o
