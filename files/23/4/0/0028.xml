Zeppelin liaid. 1. MAJOR-GENERAL ASHMORE gave full particulars of theZeppelin raid on London on the night of 19th October, 1917. he stated that on that occasion visibility was not at all good, there being considerable ground mist ; as a result, the range of thesearchlights was severely curtailed. In consequence, however, offaint sounds being heard, the north barrage searchlights wereturned on, but were unable to find the airships. To have turnedon the remainder would have been a fatal course, as there were atthe time in. the vicinity of London several airships which had lost their bearings. As illustrative of the effect of mist, it was statedthat a balloon was sent up in the vicinity of Croydon on the night in question, and when at a height of 8,000 feet London was invisible.Forty-four of our machines were sent up, but, owing to thegreat altitiide at which the Zeppelins were flying, approximatelyfrom 15,000 to 16,000 feet, though three aeroplanes saw the enemy,they were unable to attain that height, their maximum being about14,000 feet. It appeared that only one Zeppelin actually passedacross London, and did so with engines stopped.The military authorities were of opinion that, in connection withthe Zeppelins being brought down in France, they wrongly estimated the direction of the wind, and, instead of finding a west wind, andconsequently being blown to the eastward, they found a strong northwind, which took them south, over France.General Henderson pointed out that it must be rememberedthat in France these Zeppelins were attacked during daylight, andmentioned that if airships attained a height of, say, 17,000 feet whenover enemy country, the result would be that that height could not he maintained or again reached, and that it must gradually decrease.The recent raid was an instance of this, inasmuch as the highestreport from the French side was that they were at 10,000 feet, andin some cases they were referred to as being up 1,500 feet only. Allthe airships that crossed over Holland were flying very low. GeneralHenderson explained that we had as yet no aeroplanes in use capableof reaching 15,000 feet which could safely be used at night, owing tothe fact that the only machines that could attain such an altitude hada very fast landing speed, and that it was extremely hazardous toattempt night landings with those machines. He doubted whether any other nation possessed machines that were suitable. Both he andCommodore Paine emphasised the danger that would be incurred bypilots in night flying except in specially designed machines, thelatter pointing out that, owing to the great difficulty we should have in meeting the requirements as to pilots for the new programme, itwas of more value to save them and to&apos;use them for day work.Lord Cowdray explained that the first lot of the B.E. 12machines which were being constructed for home defence nightflying had been delivered within the last three or four days andwere being fitted with 200 h p. engines. The forecast of the AirBoard&apos;s Technical Department was that these machines would reach a height of 19,000 feet to 20,000 feet, but the actual test had notyet been made.The question was raised as to the answer to be given to thefollowing parliamentary question, put by Mr. Joynson Hicks to thePrime Minister: Whether he has any further statement to make regardingthe apparent lack of defence against the Zeppelin raid onFriday, and whether he is in a position to make a definitestatement as to counter-invasion of Germany by air.As regards the first part of the question, it was generally agreedthat, in the public interest, any announcement in regard to theeffects of the mist and the shortage of machines suitable for nightflying would have to be couched in very guarded language.It was considered that the second part of the question would be adequately answered by reference to the two attacks which had
already been made in the saarbrucken district, and that, if debatearose, information should be given to the House as to the recentactivity of the Royal Naval Air Service from Dunkirk. It should alsobe pointed out that up to the present the weather had been veryunfavourable for reprisals from French bases ; and, furthermore,that, after the English pilots there had gained a better knowledgeof the surrounding country, the range of the attacks would beextended. If the reprisal aspect of the case was pressed by theHouse of Commons, it was considered that Parliament should beinformed that it was the intention of the Government to carry outthe pledges they had given, not only in the letter but in the spirit,until the enemy ceased his present air attacks.The War Cabinet directed General Henderson and General Ashmore to assist the HomeSecretary in drafting a reply to the question raised byMr. Joynson Hicks.Mesopotamia. 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that General Maude had been clearing up the situation onhis right flank, which, moreover, interfered with the enemy&apos;ssupplies in that area, and tended to prevent small parties of Turksgetting through into Persia.The Etaliaii Front.Use against british of Ammuni-tion captured fromthe Russians.Proposed Anglo-French Conferenceat Boulogne.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that he hadreceived information from the Italians that German troops werebeing diverted to the Italian Isonzo front, but, that they had notbeen located there up to the present. The Italians were somewhatanxious and considered an enemy offensive imminent. general robertson stated that as regards troops the Italians were two orthree times as strong as the enemy forces likely to confront them,and that they were very well off for guns and ammunition. Thenumber of trench mortars in their possession had recently been increased. The moral of the Italian troops was said to be excellentand the men were confident.Attention was called to General Cadorna&apos;s statement that noattacks by the Italians would be possible after the middle of October.4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff confirmed therumours that British ammunition captured on the Russian frontwas being used by the Germans on the Western front against ourown troops.5. Mr. Balfour drew attention to telegram No. 111.6, dated the21st October, 1917, from the British Ambassador at Paris, asking for a Conference early next week at Boulogne.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should ascertain what were the subjects the French wished to discuss.Submarines. 6. The First Sea Lord reported the following actions against enemy submarines : (a.) An aeroplane, on the 18th October, in the vicinity of st. Catherino&apos;s Point, dropped two 100-lb. bombs on anenemy submarine, which disappeared with a heavy listto port.(b.) Our submarine &quot; E 45 &quot; sighted, on the 19th October,45 miles east of Orford Ness, an enemy submarine ofthe &quot; U 53 &quot; type, shelling a Dutch steamer, which sank.&quot; E 45 &quot; fired three torpedoes at the enemy, an explosionbeing heard, and the submarine disappearing.
7. The First Sea Lord stated that a German submarine-cruiserhad appeared in the vicinity of Dakar, evidently with a view toattacking the convoys between that place and the United Kingdom.Loss of H.M.S. ^ 8. The First Sea Lord reported that the armed mercantile&quot; Orama.&quot; auxiliary &quot; Orama &quot; had been torpedoed and sunk, but that UnitedStates destroyers had rescued all the crew. *AirBaidonChanak. 9. With reference to War Cabinet 253, Miuute 10, the first sea Lord reported that in the night raid on Chanak one aeroplanedropped three bombs on the town and two others dropped bombs in enemy territory. The only casually was one pilot injured inlanding. The day raid was entirely successful, sixteen heavybombs being dropped on the town.Dunkirk. 10. The First Sea Lord reported the following action by theRoyal Naval Air Service working from Dunkirk :-(a.) At about 10 p.m. on the night of the 19th October over1 ton of bombs were dropped on Bruges Docks.(b.) At 11&apos;40 a.m. on the 20th October about three-quarters ofa ton of bombs were dropped on Engel Aerodrome, afire being reported.   All our machines returned safely.(c.) During the night of the 20th-21st October a bombing raid was attempted on Bruges Docks, but owiug to thickweather only about one-third of a ton of bombs was dropped on the objective.(d ) At noon on the 21st October nearly half a ton of bombswas dropped on Vlisseghem Aerodrome, and half a ton of bombs was dropped on Houttave Aerodrome. the bombing machines were attacked both during the raidand on the return journey by enemy aircraft, two ofwhich, were driven clown completely out of control.(e.) On the 21st October a photographic reconnaissance andoffensive patrols were carried out; five of oxir scoutsengaged about twenty hostile scouts, two of the latter being destroyed and two driven down completely out ofcontrol.   One of our pilots is missing.Shipping Losses.Loss of H.M.S.&quot; Marmion.&quot;11. In reply to a question as to the heavy shipping lossesduring the last few days, the First Sea Lord stated that he proposedto forward a report to the War Cabinet, setting out the supposedreasons for such losses. One of the contributory causes was thewithdrawal of the Handley-Pase machines for bombing operations inFrance, no other suitable machines being available to take their place.12. The First Sea Lord reported that a collision had takenplace between the destroyers &apos;: Tirade&quot; and &quot;Marmion,&quot; and thatthe latter had sunk, only two officers and seventeen men beingpicked up. Both these vessels were at the time employed on convoywork.Bussia.13. The First Sea Lord read to the War Cabinet telegrams hehad received from the naval attache at Petrograd relative to thesituation in the vicinity of the Gulf of Riga. He stated that the&quot; Grazhdanin &quot; and the &quot; Bayau &quot; wrere trapped, as the exit to thenorth of Dago Island was too shallow to allow them to pass, and thatall other exits were in the possession of the Germans.   He added
5WG 254that the main body of the Russian Fleet were at Helsingfors, butthat the discipline in those ships was extremely bad. As regardsthe danger of this main body falling into the hands of the enemy,the First Sea Lord had prepared a statement on the subject, whichwould shortly be forwarded for the information of the War Cabinet.Admiral Jellicoe explained on a map the general situation inthe Gulf of Finland, indicating the probable German action. he further informed the War Cabinet of the dispositions of our submarines in the Baltic.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that he had norecent news as to the situation from the British Military Repre-sentatives in Russia, but he undertook to obtain their views as sconas possible.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,,    October 22, 1917.o
