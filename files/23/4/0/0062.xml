Trotzki, it would not by any means ensure that the British residents would be allowed to leaveRussia in return, and that to give way to these demands, whichwere in reality due to a German plan to force Russia to do some-thing irrevocable, would form but a precedent for further demandsof the same nature.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook to obtain the latest particulars of the situation in Russiaand the reasons for the detention of these men byMonday, December 3rd.Distribution ofForeign Office and war office telegrams.7. It was brought to the notice of the War Cabinet that therewere certain delays and some inconvenience attending the existing system of circulation of telegrams to the members of the WarCabinet. In regard to those from the Foreign Office, this appliedto the telegrams on what was known as the &quot;Special DistributionList.&quot;The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook that &quot; Special Distribution &quot; telegrams circulated by theForeign Office should be placed in envelopes inside aCabinet box, and sent to individual members of the WarCabinet for retention.
In regard to the War Office telegrams containing important military information circulated to the War Cabinet The Secretary of State for War undertook to expedite the circulation, so that all the members of the War cabinet should receive their copies at the same time as the PrimeMinister received his copy.Censorship.8. Referring to a report in the &quot; Times,&quot; of the 30thNovember, 1917, of a speech by the German Chancellor,- in whichallusion was made to a wireless telegram sent out by M. Trotzkifrom Tsarskoe Selo. Sir Edward Carson explained that theDirector of the Press Bureau had stopped a large number of telegrams in this strain. One of these (Message Y 5192/29670W 16 23 40. addressed to Reuter, London), contained the full text of the manifesto to all the belligerents, signed by Trotzki andLenin, and the Director of the Press Bureau wished for instruc-tions as to whether this message should be held up or allowed tobe published.The War Cabinet decided that This message from Petrograd should not be published until. further instructions on the subject were issued by theWar Cabinet.Russia :The Manufacture ofMunitions for.9.&apos; Sir Edward Carson, acting for Lord Milner, brought before the War Cabinet for decision the following points inregard to supplies for Russia and Roumania. The first point was the course which, in the circumstances, was to be pursued inregard to the current manufacture of munitions of war of everynature (including the machinery for the manufacture) now being,carried out in this country. Sir Edward Carson pointed out thelarge amount of labour which was being monopolised by this work,which would probably be entirely wTasted.It was generally agreed that, while to send any munitions ofwar to Russia in the present state of affairs would be inadvisable,good results in the direction of propaganda showing the friendlyfeeling in this country, might follow if other stores, such asclothing, boots. &amp;c, of which the Russians were sorely in need,were allowed to proceed to that countrv.The War Cabinet decided that &apos;(a.) The manufacture of all munitions for Russia, and themachinery for making munitions, should be suspendeduntil further orders.In applying this ruling, the Ministers concerned should exercise their discretion so as to avoid causingundue dislocation in the trades concerned.- (b.) All warlike stores for Russia at present under manufac-ture in this country, or manufactured in the UnitedStates on British credits, might be converted to the useof British and Allied Governments.(a.) In regard to clothing, boots and other equipment of anon-warlike nature for Russia, the War Cabinet decidedthat-The despatch of such articles should be continued.10. Sir Edward Carson also   referred to the point as towhether two Russian ships, now in a British port, laden with:1     munitions and other stores which had been handed over to theRussian Authorities in England and were therefore the property[1365-2883 B 2
of the Russian Government, should be allowed to proceed toRussia.The War Cabinet decided that These ships should be unloaded and their cargoes of munitionstreated as detailed in decision 9. (6.) above.11. Sir Edward Carson further reported that there were three ships, two American and one Russian, la den with; warlike stores, the property of the Russian Government, manufactured inAmerica, now on their way from the United States to Russia, and asked for a decision on the subject of their treatment.The War Cabinet decided that These ships should be intercepted, if possible, and their cargoes of warlike stores treated in the manner described in decision 9. (&amp;) above.12. The War Cabinet decided that The despatch of munitions of war to Roumania throughRussia, including the 36 6-inch howitzers recentlyallotted, should be suspended, and that any such storesas could be made use of by the British or AlliedGovernments might be diverted for that purpose.The despatch of non-warlike stores to continue in the same manner as for Russia.13. The War Cabinet decided that It was desirable that the Head of the Russian government committee now in England should be informed of these decisions by Lord Milner&apos;s Committee on RussianSupplies.Strike at Coventry. 14. The War Cabinet had under consideration the questionof the strike in the aeroplane industry at Coventry, which was seriously affecting the output of aeroplanes, and, if continued,would mean a possible decrease in the output, which was alreadybackward, of 500 machines in April, 1918. The gravity of the threatened situation was emphasized, and it was suggested thatthe best way to deal with the situation was by a personal appealon patriotic grounds by the right man, who in this case appearedto be General Smuts.General Smuts undertook to keep in touch with Mr. Barnes,who was to interview some members of the Unions con-cerned on the following morning, and, if advisable, to goto Coventry as soon as necessary to. address a meeting ofthe strikers on patriotic lines.15. In reference to War Cabinet 286, Minute 10, the WarCabinet had before them a letter from Sir George Askwith, whorequested to be relieved from his duties on the Co-co-ordination committee for Labour Disputes, on the ground that he had first been appointed as Vice-Chairman and had since been supersededin that position.Mr. G. H. Roberts explained that he had seen Sir GeorgeAskwith on this matter, but had been quite unable to move him from his determination to resign his post.The War Cabinet decided that As Sir George Askwith was a Civil Servant, a definite orderto continue to serve on the Labour Disputes Co-ordina-Supplies forRoumania.Communication tothe RussianGovernmentCommittee.Co-co-ordination committee for labour Disputes.
WG 288tion Committee should be given to him, and that if hedeclined to do this he should be relieved of his duties.National Insurance(Part li)rAmena-iuent Bill.16. With reference to War Cabinet No. 191, Minute 4, theWar Cabinet had before them a draft of the National Insurance(Part II) (Amendment) Bill, together with a Memorandumthereon (G.T.-2766).. The Minister of Labour explained the provisions of the Bill.In view of protests which had been received from certain tradesagainst their inclusion in the National Insurances (Part II)(Munition Works) Act, 1916, power had been taken in the present bill to exclude certain specified trades. Experience had shownthat certain trades had already made satisfactory provisionagainst unemployment, and wished to contract out. Under theNational Insurance Act, 1911, the amount of benefit that may bepaid is limited to one week for every five contributions. Clause2 of the present Bill empowers the Minister of Labour to varythis proportion.Mr. Roberts thought that there was hardly likely to be any opposition to the Bill in the House of Commons The treasury had offered no objection to it.The War Cabinet decided To approve the Bill and authorise the Minister of labour to proceed with it.17. With reference to War Cabinet No. 193, Minute 1, theWar Cabinet had before them the following documents : Memorandum by the Minister of Munitions on &quot; the questionof making the Munitions of War Acts binding upon theCrown.&quot;&quot;   (G.T.-1449.)Report of a Conference between representatives of the Min-istrv of Munitions and. the Admiralty.     (G.T.-2656.)Memorandum by Dr. Addison.   (G.T.-2691.)Report of Conference held 24th November.   (G.T.-2797.)It was explained that the present position of the RoyalArsenals and Dockyards stood in the way of the co-ordinationof the Government Departments dealing with Labour. Whenthe last Munitions of War Bill was in Committee in the Commons,an Amendment was moved by Mr. Hohler in favour of extending the provisions of the Munitions of AVar Acts to the Royal Dock-yards and all Government Departments where munitions of war are manufactured. The Amendment was withdrawn on theGovernment promising to consider the proposal before introducing the next Munitions of War Bill. The War Cabinet had, there-fore, to decide whether they would anticipate the Amendment,which would certainly be put forward in the House of Commons.The Admiralty did not wish to anticipate the amendment, as they found already that the present arrangements worked satisfac-satisfactorily. On the other hand it was stated that the Labour party would undoubtedly strongly press for the change to be made.The War Cabinet decided to accept the report made by lord milner and Mr. Barnes, and authorised the Ministerof Labour and the Minister of Munitions to insert inthe next Munitions of War Amendment Bill a clause tothe effect that the Munitions of War Acts should be binding on the Crown.The Question ofmaking the munitions of WarActs binding on theCrown.
Air Kaids: 18. With reference to War Cabinet 250, Minute 3, the WarmT^d011 0f COV6r Cabinefc had before them a Note by Sir George Cave covering a Memorandum by the Commissioner of Police on the progress made in providing Air Raid Shelters (Paper G.T.-2784).Sir George Cave pointed out that the cost of providingfurther bomb-proof shdlter was estimated at not less than Zlper head. Apart from the cost it was impossible at the presentmoment to provide such shelter for the population of London, andit was not considered desirable to proceed further in that direc-tion. The Committee over which he had presided recommended: (1.) That the local authorities in the Metropolitan police district be asked to undertake the duty of selectingthe air-raid shelters and strengthening them where necessary, subject to the directions of the London Air-raids Shelter Committee.(2.) That for the above purpose the local authorities beauthorised to requisition sand-bags up to an averageof 20,000 bags per authority or 2\ million bags in all,the requisitions to be countersigned by the Presidentof the Advisory Committee. The total cost of thesebags is estimated at 25.000Z.(3.) That in consideration of the local authorities providing the necessary labour and supervision no charge to bemade for the bags.The War Cabinet approved these recommendations.(Initialled)   A. B.
