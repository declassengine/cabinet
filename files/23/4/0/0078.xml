WITH reference to War Cabinet -302, Minute 8, the WarProblem. Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by  the Secretary ofState for War on the co-ordination of railway transport requirements(Paper G.T.-3054).Sir Eric Geddes drew attention to the vital question of trans-portation, the importance of which, as a factor in the present militarysituation, had, he suggested, been partially lost sight of among thegreat problems with which the War Cabinet are* confronted. Theimportance of tins question had been very considerably increased by recent events. Not only was transportation a most important factor in countering the anticipated enemy attacks on the Western front,[1365-304] B
but maritime and land transportation were the vital factors in thftarrival of reinforcements from the United States of America. TheFrench, Sir Eric Geddes pointed out, were not specially good attransportation in ordinary times, and now, when their resources were largely exhausted, they were less competent than formerly to under-take the vast transportation problem involved in the present militarysituation. On the personal aspects of the question, he pointed outthat bis own profession was that of an executive transportationofficer, and, although he liked and appreciated his present position,he felt that he could serve his country better in the role suggested for him by the Prime Minister at Versailles.The Secretary of State for War and the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff dwelt on the great importance of the question, of transportation as a factor in the military situation. Lord Derbyconsidered that there was no other person who had the same graspof the situation as Sir Eric Geddes.The War Cabinet were entirely unanimous in the view that sir eric Geddes was the most suitable person, if, indeed, he was not theonly person with all the right qualities and qualifications for the transportation post. On the other hand, they felt that the post off first Lord of the Admiralty was second to none in importance, inview of the gravity of the shipping situation, and that it would be extremely difficult to spare Sir Eric Geddes from this work. It wasalso pointed out that the Admiralty and the control of shipbuilding-had been subjected to constant changes, and that a repetition of thiswas undesirable. The choice depended upon where his services would be of greater value to the nation, since he was recognised aspossessing unique qualifications for both posts. The decision there-fore depended upon which post was the more important at thepresent moment.The War Cabinet decided -To adhere to their previous decision, and that the Prime Minister,before a communication was made to the Italian Govern -ment, should send a personal telegram to M. Clemenceauasking if the French Government would be willing toaccept General Nash to conduct the enquiry agreed to at versailles.The Labour 2. With reference to War Cabinet 248, Minute 12, Mr. BarnesSituation: reported that the Labour world was &quot;on edge&quot; in regard to thePiece-workers&apos; question of wages.    Since time-workers had received the increase ofWages. 12-1 Per cent, from the Ministry of Munitions, the attitude of thepiece-workers had become menacing all over the country. matters had come to a head that day. A strike had started in Belfast to-day,and another was timed to take place to-night at Sheffield. Ameeting of the War Cabinet Labour Committee was to be held later in the day.Sir Edward Carson said that he had gone into the case of belfast with Mr. Barnes. The men&apos;s case appeared to be unanswer-able. At the request of the Government 90 per cent, of the men had gone on piece-work earlier in the year. As a result, partly owing to shortage of material, the men were actually losing by thechange. They saw the time-workers getting an increase of 1.2-J- percent., while they themselves got nothing.Mr. Barnes said that the Minister of Munitions was preparedto promise an advance to all piece-workers who were not making* time rates plus 12-1 per cent, in addition, and to set up tribunals, com-posed of one-third employers, one-third workmen, and one-thirdrepresentatives of the Ministry of Munitions, to see that the advance was carried into effect.
The Invasion ofItaly.Arab Success.The War Cabinet decided that The question should be referred for ,decision by a committee tobe convened by Mr. Barnes, and composed of Mr. Barnes,Lord Milner,Mr. Churchill,Mr. Roberts,Sir Auckland Geddes,in addition to the War Cabinet Labour Committee,should settle the matter on the lines indicated above.who3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported the receiptof a telegram from General Plumer, despatched on the 20th December,1917, to the effect that on the same day the Italian 4th Army had made a very good counter-attack with fresh troops, and had re-takenMonte Asolone and other points. One of our Staff Officers, who had just returned from there, had brought a very satisfactory report onthe operations.4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported the receiptof a telegram from Sir Reginald Wingate, despatched on 20thDecember, 1917, to the effect that an Arabian force of the Sherif ofFaisal&apos;s army had mined and destroyed a troop train on the 12thinstant on the Hejaz Railway, south of Tebuk. The whole of theTurkish detachment on the train was accounted for, includingamongst the killed Suleiman Pasha Rifada. Considerable booty hadbeen captured, including 300 rifles, a large quantity of ammunition,and 24,O0OZ. Turkish in gold.Submarines.5. The First Sea Lord gave   his daily report in regard tosubmarines.Bombardment ofOstend.British reinforcements:Home Defence.6. The First Sea Lord reported that the monitor &quot; Erebus&quot;had bombarded Ostend on the 19th instant. The enemy had put up a smoke screen, and had further tried to mislead us by makingexplosions in places other than those in which our shells dropped.7. With reference to War Cabinet 303, Minute 2, the First sea lord stated that the Board of Admiralty had provisionally decidedthat the landing of any enemy force larger than 70,000 which might attempt an invasion of this country could be effectively interfered with by Naval forces. The figure adopted until recently had been160,000. The question was, however, still under examination, andthe door was not definitely closed to a further reduction.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff pointed out that therecent joint Conference had recommended that the Admiralty should deal with any force larger than 30,000. The First Sea Lord pointedout that the opinions expressed by the Naval representatives did notbind the Board.The further consideration of this question wras adjourned.Information for theAmerican Board.8. The War Cabinet instructed Tbe Secretary to request the Government Departments tofurnish Mr. Austen Chamberlain, the Chairman of theAmerican Board, with the fullest information re^-ardino- thedemands of the various Departments of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.[1365-304]B 2
Liquor Restriction 9. With reference to War Cabinet 241, Minute 16, the Warand Control. Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Food Controller(Paper G.T.-3028), and a memorandum by Lord I)&apos;Abernon (paper g.T.-3050) on the output of beer for the quarter commencing the1st January, 1918.The War Cabinet decided To sanction, for the quarter beginning the &quot;1st January, 1918,the 33-J- per cent, increase in the standard barrelage alreadypermitted for the last quarter of 1917.Russia. 10. Lord   Robert   Cecil   drew   attention   to   Foreign   office telegram No. 2054 from Sir George Buchanan, and No. 1502 fromSir George Barclay at Jassy.   lie added that the French Ambas-ambassador in London had been to see him, in regard to the subjects dealtwith in both telegrams, on the previous clay, and reported to him that the French Government had suggested, a delimitation of south russia into British and French spheres of activity.    As the french had a large Military Mission in Roumania, and had facilities both military and financial in this quarter, the Ukraine and adjacentdistricts would naturally fall into the French sphere, whereas theCaucasus and Don Cossack regions, being nearer to Persia, mightform the British sphere.    General Berthelot had been placed incharge of relations with the Ukranian Government by the FrenchGovernment, and the French Government suggested that instruc-tions should be given to General  Barter not to interfere withGeneral Berthelot.   He gathered from the reports in the morningnewspapers that the Cossacks had succeeded in capturing BostofF,killing 800 of the Red Guards, and that the Bolsheviks admittedtheir defeat    The policj&apos;- advocated by Sir George Buchanan andby the Allied representatives at Jassy raised an important and deepquestion of principle.   It would be impossible any longer to go onrunning two horses ; we must decide definitely whether we are tosupport the Bolsheviks in their claim to be the supreme Governmentthroughout Russia, or whether we are to recognise and assist theother de facto Governments in Russia.   We must either support theUkranians, Cossacks, Georgians, and Armenians, or the Bolsheviks ;we could not do both.    In his opinion, the forces in SouthernRussia had a fair fighting chance of success in the event of oursupporting them.    If we did not support them, the blockade ofGermany would be at an end and the terms of the armistice involved the despatch of grain and other raw materials of Southern Russia toGermany via the Danube.   Near!)&apos; all the supplies in Russia that were of value to the enemy were in Southern Russia, and now inthe hands of the people who were opposing the Bolshevik Govern-ment.   The Separatist sentiment in the Ukraine was an old story,and it appeared that the Bolshevik Government were prepared torecognise the   principle of  self-determination   in   regard   to theUkranian peoples, and to recognise the Rada.   The Ukranians hadbeen fighting with the Bolsheviks in Odessa, and here they appearedto have the support of the Jews against the Bolsheviks.   We could hope for nothing from Trotzki, who was a Jew of the internationaltype and was solely out to smash Russia and to revenge himself, notonly on the governing classes, but upon the peasants of Russian-Money was  now   being  spent by the French and  ourselves inthe Ukraine,  and it was a question for the Cabinet to decide whether this should continue.General Macdonogh stated that the Roumanian army of fifteengood fighting divisions, with 300 French officers attached to it,would form a valuable support to the Ukranians, provided Ukraniansupplies were made available for the Roumanian army.   Between
Roumania and Ukrania lay Bessarabia, which was mainly Roumanianin population. Bessarabia bad appointed a local Government of itsown. With regard to the Cossacks, he estimated their strength at approximately 250,000, and read a telegram, received throughGeneral Berthelot, from a French officer who had seen GeneralAlexeieif on the 17th December, which gave a very hopeful accountof the Cossack situation. He then read a telegram from general marshall, stating that the Russian General Bicharakhoffi who had3,000 men with him at Khanikin, on the Diala, had burnt his boats and was prepared to continue the war in co-operation with theAllies, irrespective of any orders from the Bolsheviks.It was pointed out that the information available regarding thesituation was somewhat scanty and insufficient to justify the Cabinetin coming to so momentous a decision as that raised by Lord robert cecil. There was a danger that, by backing a losing horse in southern Russia, we were destroying any hope of preventing theGermans appearing in Petrograd as the friends and helpers of an all-powerful Bolshevik Government. In this matter it was necessary totake a long view, as that Power which assisted the future RussianGovernment in the reconstruction of the country would have thewhole of Russia&apos;s resources at her command. It was further pointedout that much turned upon the military resources and military valueof the Southern Russian nationalities, and that it appeared, on the face of it, that the French Government had more information than we had regarding their prospects.Sir Edward Carson stated that he and Lord Milner had heldan important and interesting conference on the previous day withcertain officers and others familiar with Russia, and that amongthe evidence submitted to them was a statement to the effect thatthe present German policy in Russia was designed to produce as muchanarchy and chaos as possible, with a view to Russia being compelledto make a separate peace that would include the repudiation ofRussia&apos;s financial debts to her Allies, and that, after this had hap-happened, they would use the German prisoners and officers now inRussia to restore the autocracy under the Germanophil Grand DukePaul Michaelovitch.Lord Curzon pointed out that if we continued to back theUkranians, a sharp rupture with the Bolsheviks would followinevitably. He was prepared to take the risk of backing theUkranians, but was definitely of the opinion that whatever decision was come to as a result of further conferences with tbe French, thedecision should be taken by the whole War Cabinet.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) A Special Mission, consisting of Lord Milner,Lord Robert Cecil,General Macdonogh,should proceed at once to Paris to confer with M. Clemen-Clemenceau, with a view to the submission of recommendations to the War Cabinet.(b.) The Secretary to the War Cabinet should inform the british military Adviser of the Supreme War Council at versailles that the War Cabinet wished the military adviser forthwith to examine and report on the militaryquestion as to whether reliance could be placed on theProvisional Governments of South Russia to resist a bolshevik Army under German control.(c.) Meanwhile, the Director of Military Intelligence should provide the British Military Adviser at Versailles withall possible information bearing upon this subject.(cl.) The question of the recognition of General Bicharakoff atKhanikin should be left to the unfettered discretion ofGeneral Marshall.
GRoumania. 11. Lord Robert Cecil drew attention to telegram No. 732 fromSir George Barclay, which stated that the Roumanians were largely in sympathy with M. Trotzki&apos;s proposals regarding the Conference on war aims based upon the right of self-determinations. He thought thatit would be necessary for us to accept Sir George Barclay&apos;s proposal in principle, but any reply would have to be very carefully worded.The War Cabinet decided that a telegram based on the PrimeMinisters speech on the previous day should be sent in answer.American Military j 2. The Prime Minister read a decypher of a telegram justAssistance. received   from   Sir   C.   Spring-Rice,    Washington,    dated    the20th December, containing a paraphrase of the telegram sent by theAmerican Secretary for War to General Pershing, giving general pershing a free hand regarding the decision to be come to concerningthe amalgamation of American forces in French and British Divisions.The War Cabinet requested Lord Milner to see General Pershing in Paris, and to urge himto accede to the representations made in regard to thismatter by the British Government and by the GeneralStaff.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,December 21, 1917.o
