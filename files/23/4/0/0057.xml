Use of Neutral 1. LORD CURZON drew the attention of the War Cabinet toSlnppmg. Foreign Office telegram No. 5074, dated the 26th November, 1917,in which it was stated that the recommendations contained thereinare still under the consideration of the Cabinet and cannot yet betaken as agreed upon by His Majesty&apos;s Government. fl He pointedout that, by the Terms of Reference to his Committee (paper i.C.-33), such Committee was authorised to settle the question as tothe best use to be made of the neutral shipping available to theAllies, and they had done so (Paper I.C.-34).The War Cabinet requested The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to instruct the british ambassador at Washington accordingly.The Western Front. 2. The Director of Military   Operations   informed   the WarCabinet that the enemy had made a counter-attack on BourlonWood, but had been beaten off.The War Cabinet requested General Maurice to furnish to the War Cabinet as soon aspossible (a.) A report as to the casualties that have beensustained up to date in the recent offensive.(b.) An appreciation from Field-Marshal Sir douglas haig as to the actual work carried out by the cavalry.The Invasion of 3. The Director of Military Operations stated that no changeI*aly- had taken place regarding the situation in Italy.   All local attacks had been beaten- off. &apos; He added that our troops, and the French,were now astride the Brenta, and that, in all, five British and french divisions were close behind the battle-front. He mentioned thatthe Second Italian Army was being rapidly re-organised.Guns for Italy.4. With reference to War Cabinet 281, Minute 7, and paper g.T.-2754, General Maurice informed the War Cabine^ that information had been received from General Plumer which indicated that the number of French guns on the Italian front was less thanthat indicated in the report of the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff.   The French figures were as follows : 72 mountain guns,324- 75 mm.    ,,24-105   ,,16-120   ,,16-145   ,,84 155   ,, howitzers,48 155   ,, guns,making a total of as asiainst our396 field guns, and188 heavy guns,288 field guns, and201 heavy guns.Palestine.5. The Director of Military Operations stated that no changehad taken place in the situation in Palestine, and that none was likely until fresh troops, which were now being brought up, had arrived to relieve those belonging to the two Divisions who had carried out the pursuit.   Our nearest point to Jerusalem was 3 miles
There were indications- that the Turks might, in the near future,receive reinforcements in the shape oil 5,000 German troops.Submarines. 6. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported an engagement in theMediterranean between one of our destroyers and an enemy submarine. An attempt was made by the destroyer to ram thesubmarine, which was not successful. - A depth charge was dropped in her vicinity.Loss of an Airship7. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that the airship&quot; 8.S.P. 2&quot; had been lost in the vicinity of Longhope, owing toengine failure.   One officer and two men were missing.The Deputy First Sea Lord undertook to provide, for theinformation of the War Cabinet, a statement as tothe situation with regard to British Zeppelins built andbuildino-.The Adriatic. 8. The Deputy First Sea Lord gave a resume of the results of his visit to Rome, and indicated that, although the Ralians had at firstasked for battle cruisers, destroyers, and mines, they had notreferred to battle cruisers at the Conference which was held at alater date, and had accepted the fact that the Allies were unable tosend them any more destroyers for the Adriatic. We had suppbedthem with mines for the defence of the Northern Adriatic, whichthey had gratefully accepted. Admiral Wemyss added that he had also discussed with the Italian authorities, in conjunction with admiral de Bon, the transfer of the Italian Fleet to another base,and that the suggestions had been accepted by the Italians in a sympathetic manner.Co-co-ordination committee for labour Disputes.9. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byMr. Barnes on the question of the co-ordination of GovernmentDepartments dealing with wages and trade disputes (paper g.T.-2772).The War Cabinet decided To refer the matter to the Departments concerned, and, in viewof its urgency, to bring it up for consideration at to-morrow&apos;s(Wednesday&apos;s) meeting.Trade Policy. 10. The War Cabinet considered an Interim Report on Com-mercial Treaties from the Imperial Trade Policv Committeo(Paper G.T.-25441Mr. Long explained that the Report had, in the first instance,been drafted by Mr. Hewins, but as it was thought by the ForeignOffice to&quot; go too far, not in principle but in expression, an alternativedraft was submitted by the Foreign Office, and this was the documentnow before the Cabinet. The Foreign Office proposed to writeseparately to each of the Allies, showing how they would be affectedby the proposed policy.The War Cabinet agreed That a declaration should be issued on the lines set forth in the interim Report.Tonnage Situation: 11. With reference to War Cabinet 266, Minute 11, LordEestriction of Curzon undertook the Chairmanship of the Committee on RestrictionImports. of Imports in the temporary absence of Lord Milner.
Meat and Cheese. 12. With reference to War Cabinet 256, Minute 13, general smuts undertook to take Lord Milner&apos;s place in examining theproposed transfer of the organisation for the purchase of meat and cheese.Position of theCotton Industry.13. With reference to War Cabinet 208, Minute 1, the WarCabinet had before them a Memorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade on the cotton situation (Paper G.T.-2692).Sir Albert Stanley said it was difficult to deal with the subject in the absence of the Shipping Controller. It was. clear, however,that enough raw material Avould not be forthcoming to keep the mills fully employed, and, unless work could be found for the cottonoperatives near their own homes, the Government would be facedwith xinemployment on a large scale. There were at present some30,000 operatives out of work, who were for the moment being dealtwith under the scheme of the Cotton Control Board, but that scheme would shortly terminate, and the operatives would have to fall backon their &quot;Trade Union out-of-work benefit only, without the assistancefrom the levies now imposed. This would be quite inadequate tomeet their necessities. Owing to lack of shipping, a seriousrestriction of imports was probable in 19IS, and if the mills, whichwere now confined to running 60 per cent- of their machinery, were reduced to a 50 per cent, level, the number of the unemployed wouldbecome considerably more than 100,000. Two courses seemed possible : either to come to an understanding with the ShippingController to maintain the imports of cotton dining the next fewmonths, or to recognise the increase of unemployment as inevitable,and make preparations to deal with it.Sir David Shackleton said that the Ministry of Labour, theMinistry of Munitions, and the Department of National Service,were investigating the possibility of using some of the cotton millsas aeroplane factories. The mills were all top-lighted and north-lighted. Between 60 and 70 per cent, of the operatives werewomen. Many of the overlookers were semi-engineers; there wasin each shed a nucleus of skilled men. In reply to a suggestion thatsome mills might be used as shell factories, Sir David Shackletonpointed out that at the moment women were being discharged fromshell factories.Mr. Long said that there was an unwillingness on the part ofthe operatives to turn to rough employment, because the delicacyof touch necessary for their work might thereby be impaired. he added that the whole buestion of import restriction was of vitalimportance to the Dominions. Messages were being received from australia and New Zealand, pointing out that their cold storageroom was exhausted, and their inability to export their stapleproduce adversely affected their revenue.The War Cabinet decided To adjourn the discussion until the Report on the restriction of Imports has been received, it being understood that,in the meantime, every effort would be made by the ministries of Labour, Munitions, and National Service to absorb any unemployed cotton operatives in otherindustries.AustralianShipping.14. Mr. Long called attention to the fact that Australiapossessed about 400,000 tons of shipping which was now engagedin coastal trade, and that a quite inadequate offer of at first 25,000and afterwards of some 70,000 or 80,000 tons had been made to thiscountry. Australia had been pressing us to buy her next year&apos;sharvest; we should be glad to have the grain and the ships, and australia would be glad to have the money.   He would like to see
Coal for Italy. 15. The War Cabinet had before them a letter from Sir E.Wyldbore-Smith (Paper G.T.-2705) and a letter from Sir RennellRodd (Paper G.T.-2732) dealing with the subject of the dearth ofcoal in Italy.In his letter Sir E. Wyldhore-Smith suggested that the situation should be, laid before the French Government, with an intimation that Bis Majesty&apos;s Government consider that it is necessary, in orderpartially to remedy the situation in Italy, to withdraw at any rate,temporarily a certain number of British vessels at present in theFrench coal service and devote them to the transport of coal toItaly.Mr. Graeme Thomson said that the Ministry of Shipping werenot in favour of this suggestion, because they feared that the french would resent it. The Ministry of Shipping had, however, allocated to Italy four vessels, which were ready to load during the present week. This was being clone at the expense of our own depots inthe Mediterranean. In addition, 42,000 tons were being allocatedthis week, and this represented all the tonnage at our disposal afterthe absolute minimum requirements of the other services in theMediterranean had been met. The above steps should raise the shipments to over 400,000 tons, which is about the average forthe first seven months of this year.It was pointed out that the whole Allied tonnage situation wasto be reviewed at the Paris Conference, when, no doubt, theparticular case of tonnage for Italy would receive attention.The War Cabinet therefore decided that Pending the return of the Shipping Controller from the paris conference, no further step should be taken in thematter.Railway Labour 16. With  reference  to War Cabinet   275, Minute   16, theJnrest. President of the Board of Trade said that the National Union of railwaymen were meeting the Railway Executive that day. TheUnion had refused the Governments offer of 5s., and were adhering to their demand for an advance of 10s. per week. The railway executive were not authorised to offer 10s., consequently there was every prospect of a deadlock.Sir Albert Stanley undertook to report the result of that day&apos;sproceedings to Mr. Bonar Law, who would call the Cabinettogether the same evening should it appear to be necessary.Control of Raw 17. The War Cabinet had before them Interim Report No. 5,Materials. dealing  with  the  control of  raw materials, presented   by theEconomic Offensive Committee (Paper G.-175).Sir Edward Carson, the Chairman of the Committee, calledspecial attention to paragraph 12 of the Report, which urged thenecessity of. legislation of a similar character being introduced inthis country, in the Dominions, and among the Allies, and especiallyin the United States, with the object of controlling the volume,direction, and priority of their exports and imports by bcence.Sir Edward Carson laid stress on the importance of securing the active co-operation of the United States, as the United States and- [1365-283] C250,000 tons sent to this country with grain, the ships then toremain here to be pooled with oursThe War Cabinet authorised The Secretary of State for the Colonies to endeavour to make this arrangement with the Government of Australia.
Administration ofthe Defence of theEealm regulations in Ireland.18. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (Paper G.T.-2664) dealing with the representations of the military authorities regarding the use of Courts-martial for punishment of certain offences against the Defence of the realm Act in Ireland.The Chief Secretary for Ireland stated that the militaryauthorities feared that their prestige was being hurt by the useof Courts-martial to deal with offences such as unlawful drilling.Under the Defence of the Realm Act, offences could only be referredto one of two tribunals : (a.) A Court-martial;(6.) A Court of Summary Jurisdiction.The latter, owing to its character, was quite unsuitable for dealingwith the cases now arising in Ireland, and he agreed that it was desirable, if possible, that the military^ authorities should be relieved from dealing by Court-martial with all except the more importantcases. The scheme he suggested, and in which he understood themilitary authorities concurred, was the setting up, under the CrimesAct, of Statutory Courts composed of two resident magistrates.These Courts could not try cases under the Defence of the RealmAct, hut they could deal with drilling as being an &quot;unlawful assembly,&quot;which latter came within tbe jurisdiction of the Crimes Act.Mr. Duke added that the method adopted by such Statutory Courtsought, and probably would be, to require offenders to give bail and find sureties for good behaviour. This they almost invariably fail to do, and they thereupon are committed to prison. They almostinvariably went on hunger-strike, and, after a period which reduced their physical stamina, they were released, being liable to re-com-commitment in the event of their creating a further disturbance. Inhis opinion, the military forces in Ireland were on the alert andwould be capable of dealing with any serious trouble. He was in communication with the Secretary of State for War regarding thismatter.the British Empire between them control the world&apos;s supply of alarge number of the most important raw materials of industry,notably cotton and wool.Dr. Addison said that the policy laid down in the memorandum was both offensive aud defensive in its nature, and was concernedwith the situation after the War. We did, of course, controlimports and exports at. the present time.The War Cabinet were agreed that it was desirable to takeadvantage of the visit of Colonel House to obtain not only his approval of the principle set forth in the Memorandum, but also, ifpossible, of definite proposals. Further, that Sir Albert Stanleyshould be requested, on his visit to the United States (War cabinet(11, Minute 11), to discuss the application of the policy in detail.It was understood that Colonel House had informally expressed himself in favour of an economic offensive.The War Cabinet decided-To approve the Interim Report, and to request the ForeignOffice to forward it to the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, with a view to Mr. Balfour bringing it to the noticeof Colonel House in Paris.The War Cabinet also requested Dr. Addison and Sir Albert Stanley to prepare a memorandum for Mr. Balfour, setting forth definite suggestions for giving effect to the policy of the Report.
Mr. Long pointed out that the Irish Magistracy had beendebauched for the last fifteen years, and that it was quite impossibleto allow these cases to go before them. He gathered that the SinnFein leaders had been rather more guarded in their statements duringthe last week or so, and that Cardinal Logue had. made a most satisfactory contribution towards warning the Sinn Feiners of the dangers of their threatened conduct.Field-Marshal Lord French urged the desirability of settingup a Civil tribunal to deal with the Sinn Fein offenders, and statedthat he did not believe the rumours that arms or material werebeing landed for use by the Sinn Feiners from German submarines.The War Cabinet approved the course of action proposed bythe Chief Secretary.Education(Provision of Meals)Bill, Ireland.19. The War Cabinet approved the Draft Bill submitted by theChief Secretary of Ireland for dealing with the feeding of necessitousschool-children in Ireland (Paper G.T.-2718).(Initialled) A. B. L.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.,November 27, 1917.
