THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that onebrigade of Germans had landed on the island of Oesel, and appearedto be moving east and south.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that a German Alpine Corps Avas reported to have arrived in the Tyrol, and a few German artillery and technical troops onthe lsonzo Front.

Portions of thesubmarine, including a wooden hatch, were found mixed up in the&quot;Partbian&apos;s &quot; propellers, and the &quot; Parthian&quot; had been considerablydamaged by contact with the submarine. There seemed to be con-siderable prospect that, the submarine had been accounted for.Seaplanes. - 6. The First Sea Lord reported that on the 9th instant two sea-planes had attacked the Chikaldare Bridge, five miles east of Missis,on the Baghdad Railway. Owing to the open construction of thebridge, however, it was feared that little damage had been effected.Both machines were damaged by enemy fire, but had returned. Onthe following clay a seaplane started for Adana, but did not return.PunitiveExpeditionagainst Dubab.7.

The First Sea Lord reported that on the 11th instant a squadron of our naval aircraft from Dunkirk carried out bombing-raids upon the Sparappelhoek aerodrome. All our machinesreturned safely.The French Army 10. Brigadier-General Clive stated that the moral oi the Frenchand American Army had improved, and that discipline was now good, though theCo-operation. men did not possess the same keen offensive spirit as the Britishtroops. General Retain appeared to rely upon the co-operation of american troops for any offensive next year, but shared the doubtheld as to whether a sufficiently large number of fully-trained and equipped American troops would be ready.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, as far as he couldgather, American preparations were being effected very slowly, andthe Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that he was unawarewhether the Americans had yet decided upon the pattern of theirguns.
Question ofdropping ReprisalNotices whenbombing german towns.11. The War Cabinet decided that For the present, at any rate, no notices should be dropped byaeroplanes  undertaking  bombing raids  upon  Germantwns stating that such raids were being carried out asreprisals for bombing raids upon London.Man-Power and 12. The War Cabinet decided Military Eesourees. . .lo appoint the following Committee : Mr. Balfour (Chairman),General Smuts,Lord Derby, andSir Eric Geddes on questions of material,to draw up for the War Cabinet a balance-sheet dealingwith man-power, including recruiting prospects andwastage, as well as material, such as guns and aircraft,in each Allied and enemy country, such report to embracestatistics available for the year 1917, together withestimated forecasts for 191S. The Committee shoiddconsult the Director of National Service on questions affecting his Department.Ireland: General 13. With reference to War Cabinet 245, Minute 16, the ChiefConditions. Secretary for Ireland reported that the death, in Mountjoy prison, ofThomas Ashe had been a very great misfortune, having created thegreatest possible stir throughout the country. The nationalist party had seized it, as an opportunity to enable them to get back onto the platform, and had exploited to the utmost what was undoubtedly a tragic occurrence. When the Chief Secretary arrived in Dublin, he found that the body of Thomas Ashe was lying instate in the City Hall, where thousands of the populace were visitingthe remains. He was at once confronted with a problem as to what attitude the Government should adopt towards Ashe&apos;s funeral. Heconsulted the General Officer Commanding and the commissioner of Police, and all agreed that it would have been quite impossiblefor the Executive to have interfered with any popular demonstraiionconnected with the funeral without provoking the bitterestantagonism and serious disorder. About 15,000 persons followed the funeral, which was carried out in an impressive and orderly manner. Two events in connection with the funeral had given riseto ciuticism, such criticism, being directed against the chief secretary, notably by Dr. Mahaffy and Lord Midleton. These two-events were (1) the wearing of Sinn Fein uniform by some of thepersons attending the procession, and (2) the use of arms for thepurpose of filing a military salvo over the grave. These arms hadbeen smuggled into the cemetery, probably in the hearse, and, inspite of the vigilance of the police, had escaped capture. Thenumber of arms utilised was extremely small. It was clear that theNationalist Party were going to make the death of Thomas Ashe anf I 365-249] B 2The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should send atelegram to Colonel House asking him, before his forth-coming visit, to obtain full information on certain questions relating to Military, Naval, and other preparations.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff and First Sea Lordundertook to send to Mr. Balfour a list of points on whichmilitary and naval information was required.
opportunity for a demonstration in the House of Commons in orderto; do something to re-establish their still waning popularity inIreland.With, regard to the other Sinn Fein prisoners, the chief secretary stated that the medical reports submitted to him showed that the whole remaining forty were in peril of their lives. *A11the prisoners were fanatic and ready to face death, and hehad been compelled either to release them or to alter the prisontreatment. He took the latter course, and summoned a special meeting of the Irish Privy Council to give effect to the latterpolicy. -!. With regard to the Convention, he had ascertained fromCardinal Logue and the Roman Catholic Bishop of Raphoe thatthe Roman Catholic hierarchy took the view that if the Conventionproved successful the Sinn Fein movement would collapse like apack of cards, and that there was no clanger of another Sinn Feinrebellion, although in any conflict with the executive popularsympathy was invariably against the Government and added tothe popularity of the Sinn Fein movement.14. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theChief Secretary for Ireland (Paper G.T.-2251). Mr. Duke explainedthat, as a result of powers taken under the Defence of the RealmAct, a great increase in the number of allotments in the neighbour-hood of Irish towns had been effected. The holders of theseallotments represented the most industrious class of the urbanpopulation. They had paid for small allotments, mostly about one-eighth of an acre, rents up to SI. or 91. per acre, and, by breaking up pasture or unfilled land, had achieved very remarkable results which were proving of great benefit to the inhabitants. Representa-tions had been made to him that these allotment-holders were liableto be turned out at the end of the war, and they desired greatersecurity of tenure.Mr. Barnes stated that the allotment-holders in Great britain were in a somewhat similar position, and that the whole questiondeserved serious consideration.The War Cabinet decided that The Chief Secretary for Ireland should draft, for the considera-tion of the War Cabinet, a Bill giving effect to his proposals.The V/ar Cabinet further decided that The Home Secretary should consider the question from&apos; thepoint of view of the United Kingdom, and the Secretaryfor Scotland in regard to Scotland.Air Eeorganisa- 15. In view of the public interest evinced in the possibletion: formation of au Air Ministry and aerial questions generally, and ministry of the in view also of the fact that the Prime Minister had been given^ir- notice of a question to be raised in Parliament on its leassemblingthe following day asking for information regarding the policy ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to these questions, the WarCabinet invited General Smuts to make a statement reviewing theprogress which had been made by his Committee (War Cabinet 246,Minute 21). The War Cabinet were reminded, in this connection,that at their meeting held on the 24th August, 1917, they had decided (a.) To accept in principle the recommendations made in thesecond Report of the Prime Ministers Committee on air Organisation as summarised in paragraph 10 of theReport.Faciiities forAllotments inIreland.
(o.) To appoint a Committee, to act at once, to investigate andreport on the arrangements necessary for the amalgama-tion of the Royal Naval Air Service and the RoyalFlying Corps and the relationship between it and theAdmiralty and the War Office, and the legal constitution and discipline of the new unified Air Service, and prepare the necessary draft legislation and regulations for submission to Parliament at the earliest possible date.General Smuts reported that his Committee had already covered a good deal of ground. A draft Bill had been prepared,in consultation with the Law Officers of the Crown, giving powersto constitute a new Air Service. The Committee had also in preparation a new Discipline Act, Pay Warrant and other Regula-tions for the new service. The Committee had also drawn up adraft Order in Council prescribing the organisation of an air council whose functions in the new Ministry corresponded tothose performed by the Board of Admiralty and Army Councilrespectively. General Smuts said that he thought that theOrder in Council would be sufficient for the present for thepurpose in hand, and he did not consider that it would bepossible or desirable to promulgate a statutory declaration defining the exact powers of the new Ministry. A great number of detailsremained to be worked out, and this would take a considerable time. In his view it was advisable at the present juncture merely to inform Parliament that a Bill was in preparation whicb wouldgive wider powers to the Ministi-y, although those powers might not he exercised to the full until a considerable period of time had elapsed.The Secretary of State for War said that he had not yet seen the draft Bill, and he submitted that such a Bill could not beintroduced until its provisions had been carefully examined by theBoard of Admiralty and Army Council, and until it had been definitely considered whether the new Air Force could offer life-service to those who joined it.Lord Cowdray stated that the Bill was ready for a preliminarycirculation, and that he thought that in a short time a draft of thenew Air Regulations, corresponding to the Regulations for the Armyand the Navy, would be read\r for consideration by the War Depart-ments. The draft of the new Pay and Training, &amp;c, Regulationshad already been circulated to those Departments for their commentsand suggestions.Lord Curzon, speaking as former President of the Air Board,said that he was in general agreement with General Smuts. Hethought that a statement should be made in Parliament to the effectthat a Bill was in course of rrreparation which would (a.) Constitute an Air Ministry.(6.) Give power to that Ministry from time to time to amalgamatethe two existing Air Services.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thought that therewere two questions before the War Cabinet:  (1.) The institution of an Air Ministry, which apparentlyGeneral Smuts did not think could be introduced duringthe present War;(2.) The immediate question of how best to co-ordinate the air services during the War.General Smuts said that if the War Cabinet agreed with him that it might not be possible to introduce the Air Ministry in. thecourse of the War, he thought that some interim arrangement wasnecessary for the co-ordination of the air policy. He suggested thata small Cabinet Committee should be set up which should be
responsible for the general direction of oar air policy. The AirBoard, so far, had never dealt with the wider questions of policy, but had remained a supply department.Lord Cowdray stated that the Air Board&quot; had no policy atpresent beyond the supply of the needs of tbe Army and Navy.Some months back his Board had foreseen that there might bea surplus of aircraft, which would involve the Board being grantedmore extended powers, and they had therefore asked for a GeneralStaff to advise as to the use to be made of the surplus material. Hesuggested that it was for the War Cabinet to consider whether thematerial now being supplied was being used, to the best advantage.To-day Sir Douglas Haig had 1,500 machines, besides the reserve of machines on the Western Front. The Admiralty also had 1,500naval machines, with 500 seaplanes.The First Lord of the Admirahy said he agreed with Lord Derbythat a Bill could not be introduced until it had been carefully examined in its draft form by his Department, as well as by the WarOffice. With regard to the surplus machines referred to by LordCowdray, Sir William Weir had placed it on record that if thepresent Air Programme was to be fully completed, aircraft wouldhave to be granted absolute priority as regards labour and material.The War Cabinet agreed that only the War Cabinet, or amember of the Cabinet acting on their behalf, were competent todecide as regards air.policv as between the Admiralty and the WarOffice.After some discussion the War Cabinet (a.) Decided that a reply should be given to Mr. KeunedyJones&apos; question to the Prime Minister (Paper G.T.-2283)to the effect that a Bill was in preparation, and would, itwas hoped, be shortly introduced, designed to co-coordinate the two air services and provide for the eventual settingup of an Air Ministry, and that in the meantime general smuts will continue, on behalf of the Cabinet, to super-vise the Air Services.(b.) Approved General Smuts&apos; suggestion that a Committeeshould be appointed, to assemble at once, composed asunder, to advise the War Cabinet on all questions relating to air policy General Smuts (in the Chair).The First Lord of the Admiralty.The Secretary of State for AVar.The President of the Air Board.The Secretary to be appointed by the chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.,October 15, 19.17.
