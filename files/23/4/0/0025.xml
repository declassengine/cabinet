(O.A.D., No. 670.)Wastage of Britishand german divisions.2. The Director of Military Operations made a statement showing the comparative British and German wastage, by divisions?in the. Flanders battle since the 31 st July. There were 43 british divisions engaged for the first time, as compared with 57 german divisions ; of these, 23 British divisions had been engaged a secondor third time, as compared with 15 German divisions. Twenty-three british divisions had been withdrawn exhausted, as compared with48 German divisions.Casualties.Publication of casulties.3. The Director of Military Operations, in reply to an enquiry,referred to the estimate of the- comparative British and Germanlosses since the commencement of the recent offensive, up to the5th October, which had been circulated to the War Cabinet. Thefigures were : British, 148,470 ; German, 255,000.The Secretary of State for War stated that the British lossessince the 1st October were about 41,000.Attention was called to a telegram, No. 2993, from Stockholm,dated the 13th October, 1917, containing a newspaper announcement,on German authority, to the effect that during August the averageofficer casualties as published in the British casualty lists were 511a day, the highest total recorded during the War.The Secretary of State for War undertook to ascertain the facts and to arrange for a denial both in Stockholm and in thiscountry.4. Attention was called to the exaggerated reports circulatedfrom time to time in this country in regard to our casualties. Itwas suggested that these rumours, which were often made in themost definite manner, would never be checked till publicity wasgiven to the true facts.&apos; - Attention was also drawn to the false rumours that had been circulated to the effect that the bulk of the fighting was being doneby the Colonials rumours which also wpuld be effectively disposedof by the publication of Casualty Lists. Mention was made of thestatement recently communicated to a French newspaper by theDirector of Military Operations, in denial of certain false rumours inthis respect.The War Cabinet decided that It was not in the public interest to publish the whole of the casulties, but that opportunity should be taken from timeto time to dispose of the various rumours in circulation byan occasional statement by the Prime Minister.   -ParliamentaryVote of Thanks toSailors, Soldiers,  .and the Men ofthe MercantileMarine.5.

With reference to War Cabinet 239, Minute 12, the WarCabinet had before them a note by the Secretary (Paper G.T.-2309)on the subject of the Inter-Ally Council and the American Board.Lord Curzon said that, now that the three British represen-tatives had agreed to serve on the Inter-Ally Council, three steps should be taken: first, to find out who would be the french representatives ; secondly, to telegraph the names of our represen-tatives to America; thirdly, to ask the United States Governmentfor the name of the chairman whom they were sending to London.Lord Curzon undertook to provide a conference room in the privy Council offices for the meetings of the Inter-AllyCouncil.After some discussion as to the Government Department underwhich the American Board should be placed, it was decided that The American Board should be attached to the Treasury.Requirements of oil Fuel and ships in the UnitedStates of America.15. The Fourth Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that, asregards the purchase of oil fuel, we had been supplying the italian and French Governments both from purchases made in the UnitedStates of America and also from Egypt,&quot;and that the sum of such supplies only amounted to 2 per cent, of our total requirements.He added that the arrangements for purchase in the United states were working very smoothly.The War Cabinet decided that Their provisional decision, recorded in War Cabinet 190,Minute 4, should stand as regards exclusion from thescope of the Inter-Ally Council of the question of theprovision of oil fuel and ships from the United States,control of which should remain under the Admiralty.Mr. Phillips undertookChamberlain.to notify this decision to Mr. AustenOrder of the 16. In continuation of War Cabinet 241, Minute 2, the WarBritish Empire. Cabinet had under consideration a Report of a DepartmentalCommittee on certain questions relating to the Order of the BritishEmpire (Paper G.T.-2290).As regards the India Office and the Colonial Office, the view was held that the numbers allotted to them should be as proposedby the Committee, and that the Secretary of State for India and theSecretary of State for the Colonies should deal with the recommenda-tions to their Departments, forwarding them to His Majesty theKing.In connection with the other Departments of State which moreparticularly represent the workers in Great I britain, it was considered desirable that the Departments should send their recommendations to the Prime Minister for his scrutiny, and amendment if necessary.It was pointed out that this would entail an enormous amountof labour to the Prime Minister and his staff, though probably in afar less degree when the war was over, and it became largely aquestion of filling vacancies that arose in the Order.The War Cabinet felt that, with the existing pressure on their time involved in the consideration of many important questions of high policy, they could not give the requisite attention to the many
points raised in the Report of the Committee. They decided,therefore, that In the first instance, the Report should be examined on their behalf by some Minister of Cabinet rank, who should consider the Report of the Committee and advise them asto the action to be taken, and should, in addition, assembleand preside over the Sub-Committee suggested in paragraph12 of the Report.The Secretary was instructed to invite the Right Hon. the earl of Crawford and Balcarres to carry out the above decision.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.
