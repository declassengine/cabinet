THE  Chief of the Imperial  General Staff described indetail the extremely successful action on the Arras-Cambrai front.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff pointed out that these operations on the Western Front might call for an early revision ofthe decision with regard to the despatch of further Divisions toItaly.The War Cabinet decided that Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig should be informed that he might use the two Divisions now under orders, but thathe was to get together&apos; two others, not necessarily in full[1365-279] B
strength, for despatch, if required ; and that, meanwhile,the French, should he allowed to use the railway facilities to Italy now allotted to us, for the despatch of french divisions, and of heavy artillery, or anything else useful andsneeded, pending a definite decision whether more british divisions are to he sent, under the circumstances.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported thatGeneral Allenby was now within b&apos; or 7 miles of Jerusalem, to theNorth-West.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, after referring tothe published communique announcing the surrender of a good many Germans and natives in East Africa, stated that not morethan about 250 Germans, with some 3,000 natives, remained in. the field. He drew attention to a telegram from General VanDeventer suggesting that he should now make some offer toGeneral von Lettow for surrender ; and he also suggested that very good results would follow if we could make an announcement that German East Africa would not be surrendered to Germany atthe end of the war.The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointed out that, by making such a Proclamation as was proposed, the natives would be safeguarded against subsequent reprisals by the Germans, and. that many lives might be spared in the exhausting operations in this difficult country if the natives now with the Germans could be induced to desert.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that thequestion of the German African colonies was extremely difficult.There were three lines of argument which had to be taken intoaccount : (a.) Could we, under any circumstances, afford to allow Ger-many the possession of good submarine bases, such, asDar-es-Salam, after the war i(b.) Could we allow the native population to be re transfer redagainst their will to German domination ?(c.) Could the civilised world as a whole regard with equanimitythe avowed and expressed intentions of Germany tocreate a large and well-disciplined black army in the heart of Africa, which would be in a position to threatennot merely the whole of that continent, but white civilisa-tion also ?The one difficulty we had to face was the suggestion, so freelyput about by the enemy both abroad and in our midst, that theAllies, and more particularly Great Britain, were out for plunderand further territorial acquisitions. He thought that the cabinet should consider very carefully the proposal for the internationalisa-tion of the former German colonies in Africa, which would have theeffect.of preventing the creation of a naval and military menace,while at the same time the most valuable raw materials would beavailable for the factories of the world, and not merely of Germany.This question was adjourned until the following day, pending a conversation which the Prime Minister and Mr. Balfourwere to hold with Colonel House at Downing Street that afternoon.4. Sir Edward Carson said that his survey of our propagandaled him to believe that the pacifists were greatly assisted by the lack of definiteuess iu regard, to our territorial war aims.
Mr. Barnes supported this view, and the Cabinet felt that this,again, was a matter which could be better discussed after the before-mentioned interview with Colonel House.Mesopotamia: 5. On the, recommendation of the Secretary of State for WarThe Chief and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, the War CabinetCommand. approved the appointment of Lieutenant-General Sir W. R. MarshaB,K.C.B., to fill the vacancy caused by the death of General SirStanley Maude.The War Cabinet further authorised the Secretary of State forWar to make enquiries in regard to the pecuniary circumstances ofLady Maude, and took the view that in this case it was most desir-able that the State should act generously in this respect.Salonica.G. With reference to War Cabinet 277, Minute 7, attention was drawn to a further report from Lieutenant-Colonel Plunkett con-firming previous accounts in regard to the grave state of affairs at salonica, largely due to the command of General Sarrail.It was pointed out that, in addition to the other causes of weak-ness, the British troops were saturated with malaria.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that his liaison officer at Paris had seen M. Clemenceau, who had expressed mis-givings with regard to the situation, and had asked whether theBritish Government were satisfied with the existing state&apos; of affairs.What disturbed him most was the difficulty of obtaining any information. General Sarrail had not yet sent the report promised by the French Government at Rapallo (I.C.-31).The War Cabinet decided that The Prime Minister should send a strongly-worded personal letter to M. clemenceau, drawing his attention to theprevious letters that had passed regarding General Sarrailand the seriousness of the situation.Publication ofGaza Despatch.The Invasion ofItaly.With reference to the report by Lieutenant-Colonel E. A.Plunkett, dated the 17th November, 1917 (Paper G.T.-2687), lord curzon drew attention to the fact that certain of our troops werestationed in unhealthy areas, whereas other battalions were more favourably placed, the result being that the moral of the former wasnot likely to be maintained at such a high level.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook to enquire into the practicability of periodical exchanges between thetroops in the two areas.7. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff, with reference toWar Cabinet.248, Minute 7, drew attention to the mischievousattitude adopted by the Northcliffe press in regard to the publicationof Sir Archibald Murray&apos;s last despatch. He explained that it hadbeen quite impossible, on military grounds, to publish this despatch,in view of the fact that General Allenby&apos;s position before the capture of Gaza, was identically that which was described in suchdetail by Sir Archibald Murray.The War Cabinet decided that No notice should be taken of the articles in question.8. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported thatGeneral PiumeFs last telegrams were most satisfactory ; the italians had been counter-attacking, and the situation was better from every point of view.
Treatment of dependants ofSoldiers Shot forDisciplinaryReasons.9. Sir Edward Carson drew attention to the procedure of theWar Office in cases of the next-of-kin of soldiers shot for cowardiceor other crimes in the field, whereby a notification of the fact ismade and all pensions withdrawn.The War Cabinet requested- The Secretary of State for War to arrange that in future the communications made to the dejjendauts should not conveythat the man had been shot, but that he had died- on service ;and decided that Subject to the agreement of the Minister of Pensions, thepensions should be paid in the same manner as to soldierswho had died on active service, and that the same should apply as regards officers.The War Cabinet further decided that This decision should be made retrospective.Mr. Barnes undertook to discuss this matter with the Ministerof Pensions, and was given full powers to make all arrange-ments.Submarines.10. The First Sea Lord reported two engagements with enemy submarines, during which seaplanes had dropped bombs in theirvicinity, with the possibility that one of the submarines was seriously damaged.H.M.S. &quot; Candy- 11. The First Sea Lord reported that the sloop &quot;Candytuff&quot;tuff-&quot; was torpedoed in-the Mediterranean on the 18th instant, 4 officersand 11 men being killed. The commanding officer states that he isof opinion that the enemy submarine wras sunk by gunfire.Light Cruiser 12. With reference to War Cabinet 277, Minute 12, the FirstAction in the North Sea Lord stated that 22 German prisoners, of whom. 1 officer and sea. 5 men were naval ratings, had been taken during the recentengagement in the Heligoland Bight.   They were part of the crew of an outpost vessel.British Submarines 13. With reference to War Cabinet 266, Minute 8, the First sea in the Baltic. Lord stated that the Admiralty had under careful consideration thequestion of the British submarines in the Baltic. The minefields inDanish waters would probably prevent the submarines leaving, butit was possible to cause the submarines to be interned in a neutral country, and thus release their crews. Admiral Stanley had beenasked for his views on the subject.The Italian Front. 14. The First Sea Lord stated that British monitors based onVenice had bombarded and destroyed a bridge over the Piave River.U.S.A. Destroyer 15. The   First  Sea  Lord   stated  that  the U.S..A. destroyer&quot; Chauncey.&quot; &quot; Chauncey &quot; had been in collision with a transport,, and had been sunk, 3 officers and 18 men being lost.Roumania.16. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew the attentionof the War Cabinet to a very important telegram that had beenreceived from Roumania (No. 690, dated the 17th November, 1917).
Poland. 17. With regard to Sir Edward Carson&apos;s intimation referred toin the previous Minute, concerning the Poles, the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs entered a caA-eat regarding Count Horodyski.The latter was urging us to make a further announcement in favourof an independent Poland and an independent Bohemia. Mr. Balfourthought that we should not go further than the very strong declara-tion made recently by us on the anniversary of the death of thePolish patriot Kosciusko. As far as his personal sympathies Avereconcerned, although he did not in any way wish to minimise theefforts of many of the Poles, he thought the Bohemians Averedeserving of the greatest consideration from the Allies. They had made great sacrifices for the Allies, but he feared that, owing totheir geographical position, the ideal of independence appearedchimerical; the utmost that they could hope for being home rulewithin the AristroT-Iungarian Empire.Supply of Guns to IS. The War Cabinet had under consideration a telegram from italy. Mr. Churchill in Paris (Paper G.T.-2689) relative to the supply ofrifles, guns, and ammunition to Italy, as well as a request by theMinister of Munitions to Lord Derby that, if the War Cabinet decided on the principle of affording aid, General Furse might be authorisedto settle the main details direct with Mr. Churchill.Lord Derby stated that he had sent General Furse across toFrance to confer Avith Mr. Churchill on the subject, and that he was prepared to endorse any arrangement that may be agreed to byGeneral Furse. If such arrangement did not cover the whole of theItalian demands, Lord Derby considered that the question of such further supply should be considered by the Committee on theAllocation of Guns in relation to the demands put forward by ourown armies and by those of the other Allied Governments (WarCabinet 247, Minute 7).The War Cabinet decided that Sir L. Worthington Evans should telegraph to Mr. Churchillthat the War Cabinet would! support any arrangement he might make with the Italians, if agreed to by General[1335-279]   &apos; CHe attached the greatest importance to our refusal to accept any idea of countenancing a separate peace with Germany, and hethought that the only practical way out of the difficulty was to get into touch with General Kaledin and M. Savinkoff, who was now withthe former, through Roumania, Avith a view to obtaining their support for the Roumanians.In this connection Sir Edward Carson reported that he had hadan important meeting on the preAdous day with Count Horodyski, a polish leader, at which the Director of Military InteUigence (GeneralMacdonogh) had been present. As a result of this meeting, he-believed that the formation of a nucleus of Poles, Cossacks,Roumanians, and Armenians was a practical proposition, whichmight be realised, should we be able to get at General Kaledinthrough the Roumanians and through America. It was quite clearthat the British were most unpopular in Russia at the presentmoment, and that it Avas questionable policy for Great Britain to approach General Kaledin, who was still only the leader of a faction,officially or direct the importance AA*as urged of our doing nothing which appearedto take sides in the internal dispute now raging in Russia.The War Cabinet decided that The Chief of the Imperial Staff should confer with his Intelli-gence Department, with a view to selecting an individualto be sent, either from this country or from Roumania, toget into touch with General Kaledin.
Furse, who had received instructions on the subject from lord Derby; also that the War Cabinet approve of preliminary studies for a Conference at the end of thismonth as regards the Italian output of munitions, but thatthey could not agree to Mr. Churchills proposals to bargainfor a reduction in the shipping tonnage allotted to France,as this was a matter within the province of Lord MilaeFsCommittee.Palestine. 19. With reference to War Cabinet 277, Minute 6, Lord Curzonstated that a Proclamation had been prepared and that it was mostimportant that, if and when Jerusalem were captured, the newsshould be made known in a wray calculated favourably to impressIndia and the Mohammedan world, and to satisfy them that the moslem Holy Places would be protected.The War Cabinet decided that IMo statement as to the capture or imminent capture of Jerusalemshould be issued to the press before the Prime minister had publicly had an opportunity of giving assurances as tothe protection to be afforded to the Holy Places of the moslems and Christians.&quot;Wages in 20. With reference to War Cabinet 252, Minute 1, the WarEngineering and       Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Minister of MunitionsFoundry Trades.       on        question of extending to semi-skilled and unskilled time-workers the bonus of 12^ per cent, recently granted to skilled time-workers in the engineering and foundry trades.It was explained that a decision was urgently required, as themen in some areas were being kept at work with difficulty. Thepresent demand arose. directly out of the recent concession of12^- per cent, to skilled workers. Subsequent to this decision, theCommittee on Production had granted a further general advance of5s. The result was that those grades which had only received the advance of 5s. were asking for the, bonus of 12^- per cent. If this were granted, the relative positions of the skilled and semi-skilledwould be once again what it was before the bonus was given.Further, the sums involved in the present demand were very large.The whole position was unsatisfactory and showed that someco-ordination of the Departments dealing with Labour was verymuch needed.The War Cabinet authorised Lord Milner and Mr. Barnes to decide whether or not the advance now asked for should be granted.Inter-Allied 21. With reference to War Cabinet 274, Minute 11, Mr. AustenCouncil. Chamberlain stated that he had been asked by Mr. Crosby, thechairman of the Inter-Allied Council, whether he could make itconvenient to attend meetings of the Council in Paris, as itwas desired by the French authorities to hold the same there.Mr. Chamberlain added that the matter was not a question of hisconvenience, but that he understood it was the wish of the BritishGovernment that the meetings of the Council should be held inLondon, as it was, on the whole, the most suitable place for thepurpose.It was pointed out that it was quite impossible for general smuts, who was a member of the Council, to attend meetings inParis, in view of his manifold duties elsewhere.
The War Cabinet decided To adhere to the original arrangement, namely&apos;, that the headquarters of the Council should be in London, and requested Mr. Austen Chamberlain so to inform mr. Crosby.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,November 21, 1917.
