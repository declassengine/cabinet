Law informed the War Cabinet that he had discussed the railwaylabour situation that evening with Mr. J. H. Thomas, M P., theGeneral Secretary of the National Union of Railwaymen. Mr.Thomas had at first pressed for an advance of 7s. 6d. per weekinstead of the 5s. already offered, but had subsequently suggested a compromise on the following lines : (a.) The Government should insist on the men who had goneon short work in Liverpool resuming full work as acondition precedent to negotiations ;(b.) The Government should agree to grant an advance of 6s.instead of 5s. per week ;(c.) The advance should date from 1st November.Mr. Thomas undertook, if these terms were granted, to do his utmost to persuade his Union to accept them. It was explained thatthe insistence on a further advance even of Is. was, no doubt, due tothe natural desire to secure better terms for the members of theNational Union of Railwaymen than had been obtained by the associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen..** On theother hand, if the Is. were granted, it would have to be given also[1365-284]
to the smaller Society. Mr. Bonar Law said that, while he believedit wordd be necessary for the Government to make a stand againstthe repeated demands for increases of wages, he did not think itwould be possible to carry public opinion in resisting a demand fora further Is. a week. He had discussed the matter with the PrimeMinister on the previous evening, and he also expressed the hopethat it would be possible to offer resistance in this case. .Sir Albert Stanley said that if all that was involved was thepaying of Is. a week, or 2,00O,0OOZ. a year, to avoid a strike, allwould willingly agree to the advance. The real difficulty was tosecure that the concession did not bring fresh evil results in itstrain by its reflex action on other unions and other wage settlements.There were two motives at work among the men of this union : a desire to score off the smaller union, and a feeling that other tradeunions were obtaining much better terms than the railwaymen. Ifa strike ensued, they would undoubtedly base their case on thelatter ground. The recent grant of 12-J- per cent, to the engineers,and the advance some months ago to the colliers, had produced inthe railwaymen a determination not to be left behind in the matterof advances. Illustrations of other sources of irritation were given.The Admiralty and the Ministry of Munitions were quoted as paying2s. 6d. per hour for overtime, and such competitive action on thepart of Government Departments was a very disturbing factor. Ithad been dealt with in a Memorandum by Mr. Barnes, which was before the War Cabinet at the present time.Sir H. Walker, in reply to a suggestion that the whole case should go before the Committee on Production, said there were difficulties in such a procedure. The offer of 5s. per week had beenmade as from the 26th November, whereas the Committee on production would, in all probability, grant it only as from the6th December. The men would thus obtain a worse award from theCommittee on Production than the offer now made. Another phase of the problem of giving more than 5s. to the railwaymen whichhad to be borne in mind was the effect of any award on theposition of the shopmen, of whom there were over 100,000. Of these the National Union of Ftailwaymen claimed^ o^ represent about70,000. A. large proportion of the men in the. shops were on plainpiecework.Sir W. F. Marwood dealt with the contention put forward bythe railwaymen that they were &quot;among the lowest paid workmenbefore the wrar, and therefore deserving of larger increases of paynow, and said it was almost impossible to translate the wage increases in different industries into percentages. In the coal industry, forexample, the increases on pre-war wages have varied from 30 percent, to 50 per cent, in the different fields, but the recent Is. 6d.per day was a flat rate all round. In the case of the men actuallygetting coal a man might earn, say, 8s. 4d a day pre-war ; he now would get, in the two extreme cases, from 10s. lOd. to 12s. 6d., plusin each case Is. (id. i.e., 12s. id. or 14s. an increase of 48 per cent,in one case and 68 per cent, in the other. In the case of all gradeson the coalfields the increase might vary from 45 per cent, to75 per cent., according to the grade and district. Similarly, in thecase of engineering works : a labourer at 20s. a week pre-war hashad bonuses of 20s., and now gets 12J per cent, on all earnings i.e., 45s. in all - an increase of 125 per cent- ; but a skilled man at60s. pre-war gets the same bonus of 20s., plus 12^ per cent, on allearnings- i.e., 90s.- an increase of 50 per cent. On railways ashunter or platelayer at 23s. would, under the present proposal of20s bonus, get an increase of 87 per cent. A driver at 48s. would get an increase of 42 per cent. Taking the average railway wage at28s. 6c/., the increase all round would be 70 per cent.Sir David Shackleton pointed out that in comparing railwaymen and miners it had to be remembered that some of the latter workedshort time.   On the general question he thought it important to
endeavour to co-ordinate any award now made with, the otherawards in respect of date of operation and date of renewal of application for any farther advance, e.g., that no further applicationfrom the railwaymen should be considered earlier than four monthsafter the 1st December. The Associated Society had, in effect,accepted these conditions, and the National Union should be askedfor similar guarantees. It was true that the National Union offerednot to reopen the wage question unless there was a substantial increasein the cost of living. The truth was that, with the present increases,wages were brought up very near to the increased cost of livingduring the war.In reply to a suggestion that any advance now granted shouldbe recovered from the public by advancing fares, Sir Albert Stanleysaid that traffic was expanding at a great rate, and that, though the longer journeys were being discontinued because of their discomfort,there was more travelling. He thought any further increase of passenger fares beyond the recent addition of 50 per cent, would bevery unpopular.In this connection Sir Auckland Geddes informed the WarCabinet that an enormous proportion of the workers had changedtheir place of occupation during the war, and that perhaps a million and a half, more people travelled to and from their work than wasthe case before the war.Mr. G. H. Roberts did not think it would be possible to risk astrike on the narrow issue now before the War Cabinet, but itmight be possible to adhere to the 1st December as the operative date and to refuse to reopen negotiations under four months, andthen only if it could be shown that the cost of living had gone up.Sir H. Walker said the question of the operative date was&apos; one on which there was some strong feeling, but it was not worth whilefighting about it. He would like to be free to do his best for the26th November.The War Cabinet were impressed with the importance of setting in motion immediately machinery for co-ordinating thework of the Departments dealing with labour and with thedesirability of enunciating some guiding principles, such as the relation of wages to cost of living, for the determination of disputes in future.The War Cabinet authorised Sir H. Walker to write to Mr. J. H. Thomas saying that further negotiations with the National Cnion of Railwaymenfor increased wages will be suspended until the return of the Liverpool men to full work, but that on return &apos;towork of these men negotiations will be resumed. SirHerbert Walker was authorised in that event to make afinal offer of 6s. per week instead of 5s., and, if necessary,to date the increase back to the 1st November upon theunderstanding that no further demand for increased wagesis to be made unless the cost of living substantiallyincreases, and, in any event, net before March next.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,November 28, 1917.
