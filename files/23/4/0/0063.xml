THE Director of Military Operations stated that GeneralLudendorff had visited the Western front on the 23rd November,and that as a result the enemy had planned a determined effort torecapture the positions we had gained on ,the 20th November. TheGerman offensive began by attacks on the salient which we had formed in their defensive system. That on the north had failed,but to the south they gained 6,000 yards, of which we had since,by counter-attacks, recovered 4,000. At one point to the south ofthe line they had gained to a depth of 1,500 yards inside our original line, i.e., as it existed prior to the 20th November.Estimates at present gave our losses as 40 guns and 3,000 officersand men taken prisoner. General Maurice stated that there were indications that the enemy intended to continue their attacks, that more troops were being brought up to the southern portion of theline, and that the enemy had 12 fresh divisions on the western front which they could throw into the line at Cambrai or such other[1365-289]B
places as they might select. Five divisions had been transferred from Flanders since the battle began, and 9 divisions fromother portions of the Western front. The position on the 2ndDecember was that there were, in the Cambrai sector, 15s british divisions. .5 of which had had heavy losses, whereas the enemy had17 divisions, 5 of which had probably bach very heavy losses. our casualties in the Cambrai sector between the 20th November and2nd December were 27,000. The cavalry casualties in our attacksof the first stage of the battle consisted of only 27 officers and .320men. As regards &quot; Tank &quot; casualties, no figures had yet beenreceived, though a good number had been damaged. GeneralMam-ice added that we had carried out a small attack on thenorthern portion of the Cambrai front yesterday, and had captured12 machine guns and 40 prisoners.General Smuts stilted that, in his opinion, it was a seriousmistake to send further reinforcements to Italy. As he understood,the position at present was that four divisions were in Italy, a brigade and some of the artillery of the 5th Division had alreadybeen despatched, and the 6th Division, though under orders, had notyet left, tie was strongly of opinion that the Germans had lost their chance of breaking through oh the line of the Piave, and itwas improbable that they would endeavour to make two efforts, suchas on that position aud at Cambrai, at one and the same time, andthat consequently it would be a great mistake on our part to concentrate our troops in a position where they would not be urgently needed. He advocated cancelling the despatrdi of the 5th and 6thDivisions, and recalling that portion of the 5th Division that hadalready left for Italy.The Director of Military Operations stated that he had wired tothe Chief of the imperial General Staff suggesting delay, and it hadbeen agreed that the departure of the 6th Division should be post-poned. As regards the 5th Division, the remainder would continue their departure for the Italian&quot; front on the 5th December. general maurice stated that the Chief of the Imperial General Staff held thesame view as General Smuts, and Lord Derby indicated that he wasalso in agreement.The War Cabinet decided, subject to the approval of the PrimeMinister, that The departure of the remainder of the 5th Division should be postponed, and that that portion which had left for italy should be recalled, and that the 6th Division should beretained for the present on the Western front.The War Cabinet further directed The Secretary to communicate as necessary in this matter withthe Prime Minister, and to convey the decision of the latter to the Secretary of State for War. -&apos; - - :The Invasion of 2. The Director of Military Operations stated that no alterationhad taken place in the situation in Italy. Our troops were now taking over that portion of the line which had been allotted to them,and General Plumer had: offered to take over a further section in afew days&apos; time, which proposal had been gratefully accepted byGeneral Diaz.3. The Director of Military Operations stated that general allenby had reported that his preparations were proceeding satisfactorily, and that there were indications, by the easy capture of prisoners, that the moral of the Turkish troops was not of a highorder.Italy.Palestine.
East Africa.Disloyalty of canadian troops.Submarines.Loss of a BussianDestroyer.Palestine.Russia : CaucasusArmy.Persian CossackDivisions.4. The Secretary of \State for War reported that South-EastAfrica was now clear of the enemy, the remaining troops underVon Lettow having fled into Portuguese territory.The Cabinet authorised The Director of Military Operations to send a congratulatorytelegram to General Van Deventer and the troops imder his command, expressing their appreciation of the greatendurance and resolution they had shown in clearing theenemy out of such difficult country.5. Sir Edward Carson informed the War Cabinet that he had heard that the Canadian troops cpuartered at Shorncliffe had showndisloyalty and had been guilty of revolutionary proceedings.The War Cabinet requested The Secretary of State for War to make enquiries into thematter through Sir George Perley, and in due course tomake a further communication to the War Cabinet.6. The First Sea Lord reported that the German submarine&quot; U B 81.&quot; had hit one of our mines yesterday and had been destroyed ; 2 officers and 4 men had been taken prisoner.7. The First Sea Lord reported that a Russian destroyer hadbit a mine in the Gulf of Finland and had sunk, 16 of the crewbeing saved.8. The First Sea Lord reported an attack by enemy seaplaneson Sukeir, a port to the north of Gaza, which was being used for landing stores, &amp;c.   The raid had caused no damage.9. Mr. Bonar Law informed the War Cabinet that he hadreceived a communication from M. Nabokoff pointing out that theRussian army in the Caucasus was remaining loyal to the Provi-sional Government in Russia, and that a national army was being raised by the Georgians, Armenians, and Tartars with a view to continuing the war against the Central Powers. M. Nabokoff had pointed out that, to enable this loyal movement to progress, fundswere necessary, and the Russian Commander-in-chief asked for a loan of 300,000,000 roubles, 70,000,000 of which were requiredforthwith.It was further pointed out that the British Minister at Tehran,in his telegram No. 413 of the 30th November, 1917, considered itwas worth our while to entertain a proposal of the nature referredto above ; aud, further, in his telegram No. 414 of the same date,advocated that it would be politic to finance the Persian CossacksDivision, wdio were cut off from supplies of money.The War Cabinet decided that Any reasonable demands for money from the Russian CaucasusArmy and the Persian Cossacks Division should be met bythe Treasury ;and requested The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs so to informSir C. Marling, and also acquaint M. Nabokoff as necessary.[1365-289]B 2
South Eussia. 10. The War Cabinet proceeded to discuss the need of makinga tremendous effort to maintain South Russia on the Allied side,and the steps that had best be taken to retain their help.It was pointed out that financial assistance would also be needed for any movement on the part of both the Cossacks andUkranians, and the War Cabinet decided that  *Such assistance should be forthcoming, and requested The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to telegraph to the British Minister at Jassy and to General Ballard tothat effect.iThe War Cabinet further desired The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to inform theBritish Ambassador at Petrograd of the action taken, andacquaint him, with reference to his telegram No. 1886, ofthe 28th November, 1917, that the policy of the BritishGovernment was to support any responsible body in Russiathat would actively oppose the Maximalist movement, andat the same time give money freely, within reason, to such bodies as were prepared to help the Allied cause ; andthat the detailed arrangements as to the establishment ofUkraine, Cossack, Armenian, and Polish banks were leftto the discretion of Sir George Buchanan.Archangel! 11. The War  Cabinet had under consideration  a telegram(No. 50 of the 28th November, 1917) from the British consul at archangel, endorsing in part a communication from CaptainProctor as to the establishment of a British base at Archangel, witha view to present or future emergencies.It was pointed out that if some old battleships with somemarines were sent there a place of refuge would be formed forBritish residents in Russia ; that it would provide a door for com-munications with that country in the future, and that it would havea good effect from a propaganda point of view.The War Cabinet requested The First Sea Lord, after consultation with the Chief of theImperial General Staff, to go into the matter of naval assistance being rendered, and to inform the War Cabineton the following day as to any naval action that theAdmiralty were prepared to recommend.12. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum bySir Auckland Geddes (Paper G.-174) concerning the man-powerreserves of the country.Sir Auckland Geddes pointed out that, without some such legislation as was proposed in his memorandum, it would be quite impossible to obtain for the army anything like the number of mendemanded for it. If it was decided that the proposed legislation was impracticable, namely, the raising and lowering of the military age and the application of conscription to Ireland, he feared that theavailable reserve was extremely small. Further than this, thexrumber of men obtainable by administrative means was restricted by the pledges given, in the first place by Mr. Asquith and subse-quently by Mr. Arthur Henderson, regarding the protection to begiven to skilled workers. To get even a proportion of the men required for the army it would be necessary to cut down ship-building, food-producing, or munitions programme, or all three. Itwas not likely that any considerable further number of coal minerscould be obtained without a serious strike, and it was really aquestion whether the Government were prepared to run the almost
certain risk of a breach, with labour in this country or incur theresponsibility of applying conscription to Ireland if any substantial numbers were to be got. In regard to Ireland,, it would beimpossible to apply the tribunal method, and the men would haveto be seized. As far as he was in a position to ascertain, he thoughtthat a good deal could be done to economise man-power in the homearmy, and instanced certain cases that had been brought to hisnotice regarding the short hours of military employment allotted tocertain details of the Royal Defence Corps. He wished to impress upon the Cabinet the fact that the gravity of the situation was real,and that it must be taken into account, in determining our.futurestrategy. This country was straining all its resources to the utmost,and was nearing the breaking-point.Lord Derby stated that the position in France was serious, andthat the Army Council should know at an early date exactly whathelp could be expected.It was urged that, before we entered into any further commit-ments as regards the help to be given to other countries, such as toItaly or Greece, any proposals for such action should be submittedto the War Priorities Committee for consideration.The War Cabinet decided that In view of the practical impossibility of carrying through anyof the legislative proposals suggested by Sir auckland geddes in the present House of Commons, Sir auckland geddes should prepare a further memorandum for theWar Cabinet, setting forth as briefly as possible thesituation as regards man-power and the administrative action that might be required to render any remainingsurplus available for military service ;and requested  Lord Derby to submit a detailed analysis of the Home Army,showing the exact nature of the duties performed by it.Strike at Coventry. ]o. With reference to War Cabinet 2SS, Minute 15, Mr. Barnesinformed the War Cabinet that, as a result, of negotiations which heand General Smuts had conducted with representatives of theEngineering Employers&apos; Federation, the Coventry and DistrictEngineering Employers&apos; Association, the Executives of the TradeUnions of the Coventry Engineering Trades Joint Committee andof the men concerned, the following agreement had been arrivedat :-&quot;Provided that the men resume work on Tuesday, the4th December, immediately after breakfast, in accordance with recommendations of their representatives, -which will be made,a further local conference will be arranged to meet on the same day to open negotiations upon all the points in dispute.&quot; The employers and the workmen will approach thesubject with a desire to secure satisfactory conclusions.&quot; The Government on their part will urge upon the* Employers&apos; Federation and the Trade Union Executives thenecessity for an immediate settlement, among other general questions affecting the relationship between employers andtrade unions, of that of the position of shop stewards in relationto both.&quot; Both parties undertake that there shall be no victimisationas a result of the dispute on either side.&apos;&apos;
The War Cabinet decided to request The Minister of Labour to draw the attention of the representartives of the masters and men to the obligation resting onthe Government to secure an immediate settlement, and suggesting that, in additiou to the local conferencesummoned for to-morrow, a conference to deal witlj outstanding general questions should meet this week.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.
