THE Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that, in lord Nbrthcliffe&apos;8 consequence of the appearance in &quot; The Times &quot; of Lord Northcliffe&apos;sLetter, letter refusing the position of Air Minister, Lord Cowdray had sentin his resignation as President of the Air Board. He explained that,though it was quite true that he had sounded Lord Northcliffe witha view to his accepting the post in question, there was absolutely no justification for such a letter, which had naturally put Lord Cowdrayin a very difficult position. He read to the War Cabinet the draft ofa letter which he proposed to send to Lord Cowdray, explaining thecircumstances.The War Cabinet agreed that some such step was necessary,and were unanimous in expressing the view that Lord NorthclifiVsletter was not only unjustifiable in its treatment of the question ofthe appointment to the Air Ministry, but was most mischievous inthe entirely false impression it conveyed of the relative effort and organisation of the United States and this country.Enemy Agents in 2. Tbe attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to a telegramy&quot; from Sir Rennell Rodd, No. 937, (Appendix I), suggesting that avery strong telegram should be sent by the Prime Minister to theItalian Prime Minister, asking him to take drastic measures to put as top to the licence accorded to enemy agents in Italy, and pointing out that we could not afford to send our troops to a country honey-combed with spies.It was pointed out that both the British and French IntelligenceDepartments confirmed Sir Rennell RodcVs view as to the extent ofthe evil.The War Cabinet agreed that it was desirable that representationsshould be made to the Italian Government on the subject.[1365-276]I^gjfeg^ent is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government^
Supreme WarCouncil:relations betweenArmy Council andBritish PermanentMilitaryRepresentative.*3. With, reference to War Cabinet 275, Minute 14, tbe WarCabinet had under consideration the Proceedings of the 237thMeeting of the Army Council, held on the 12th November, 1917, inwhich is raised the question of the relations between the ArmyCouncil and the British Military Representative with the supreme war Council (Appendix II).Inasmuch as the Army Council is the supreme military authority in regard to the military forces and the defence of theEmpire, and, further, inasmuch as General Sir Henry Wilson is anOfficer in the British Army, the War Cabinet do not question thathe is subject to the authority of the Army Council.The War Cabinet attach the utmost importance to the properdevelopment of the new organisation which has been drawn up tomeet the requirements of an exceptionally grave situation. they realise that the success of the new scheme will depend largely uponthe cordial co-operation and goodwill of the Army Council, onwhich they count.The War Cabinet desire to express their wish that, in developing the work of the Supreme War Council, it should be understood thatthe British Permanent Military Representative will have unfettereddiscretion as to the advice he offers.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,November 17, .1917.* This Minute has been formally communicated to the Army Council.

APPENDIX T.Sir R Rodd to Mr. Balfour. (Received November 1.6.)(No. 937.)(Telegraphic.) Rome, November 15, 1917.DESPATCH which goes by messenger to-day explains to you the difficulties whichI have encountered in urging the Government to activity in measures against enemyagents and propaganda.Under-Secretary of State of the Interior of late Government has just been here and confirmed from his personal expeiience views held by Milanese and all earnestsupporters of the cause that position is serious, owing to the weakness of theAdministration in dealing with the evil. He spoke very strongly, affirming thatthe people were good, and only needed leading, but that if the Government wouldnot lead and crush the poisonous influences which were responsible for the recentdisaster, the country was lost.I have done my best, and secured insertion of a passage on the subject in the ministerial declarations, but much more is wanted.Under-Secretary of State in question insisted that His Majesty&apos;s Government mustact regardless of the feelings of Ministers, and only their action would have effcet.I should suggest a direct, courteous, but strong message from the Prime Ministerto President of Council stating that, from information we had received, it was evidentthat enemy agents, both German and Italian, were still at large in Italy, and that their presence constituted a danger to the whole Allied cause. Now that our troops were onthe Italian front we could not afford to ignore conditions so dangerous, which were ofa nature to frustrate valid assistance we can render to Italy in the hour of danger. Wehad therefore a right to insist, and must insist, on immediate expulsion or internmentof all enemy subjects and drastic action against anti-Ally propaganda.APPENDIX II.W.P.-65. -Proceedings op the Army Council, 12th November, 1917237th xMeeting.Present:The Secretary of State.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff.The Adjutant-General.The Quartermaster-General.The Master-General of the Ordnance.The Civil Member.The Finance Member.The Deputy Chief of the Imperial General Staff.The Director-General of Military Aeronautics.The Director-General of Movements and Railways.The Surveyor-General of Supply.The Secretary.Agenda.1.
