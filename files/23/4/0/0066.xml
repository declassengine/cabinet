Palestine. 1. THE   Chief  of the  Imperial  General Staff stated  thatGeneral Allenby had reported that one of his corps in the front linehad been relieved, and that good progress was being made in otherpreparations.East Africa. 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff gave a statement ofthe units which were being released from East Africa and transferred. to other theatres of war.United states troops with theBritish Army.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that thequestion of placing units of the United States infantry into battalionsor brigades of British infantry had been cordially received by colonel House, to whom it had been referred by the Prime Minister.Mesopotamia.Explosion atFrankfurt.4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that Jebel-Hamrin, on the right bank of the Dialha, had been taken by thesuccessful action of British troops on the 3rd December. Ourcaptures amounted to 150 prisoners, including 4 officers, 2 field guns,and 1 machine gun. Our operations were assisted by the vigorousco-operation of a Russian detachment on our right flank.5. lire Chief of the Imperial General Staff gave details of the explosion which had recently taken place at a munitions and explosives factory near Frankfurt-am-Main, and explained that thedestruction of this factory implied a most serious loss to theGermans, since it was a most important centre for the manufactureof asphyxiating gas, and had been producing a very large output ofsaltpetre, high explosive, and hydrogen.The War Cabinet decided that All details possible of this occurrence should be made public,and requested The Secretary of State for War to communicate withEdward Carson in regard to publication.sir the Invasion ofItaly.6. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff quoted a telegramfrom General Plumer to the effect that the enemy had made strongattacks on the Asiago Plateau on the 3rd December, and that allthese attacks had been repulsed except at one advanced point.General Plumer had visited the army and corps commanders holdingthe line of the Piave, who had all expressed confidence in their ability to hold their own.,The Western Front. 7. The Chief of the Imperial General  Staff stated that, inaccordance with the decision of the War Cabinet the previous day(War Cabinet 290, Minute l), he had telegraphed to the Field-Marshal Commanding-iu-Chief in France approving his proposed action in taking up a somewhat withdrawn defensive position. Hehad since received a telegram from Field-Marshal Sir douglas haig (No. O.A.D. 723, dated the 5th December, 1917), in which thelatter had reported that the enemy attacks had not been seriouslyrenewed that day, and that his impression was that the enemy were, for the time being, exhausted. The attacks had been made by heavy masses, preceded by &quot;Storm Troops,&quot; amongst which our guns,machine guns, and rifles did great execution. He had comparativelyfresh divisions in the front line, and the artillery defence had been
organised. These measures, coupled with the proposed withdrawal,should stabilise the situation on the Cambrai front. Regarding thefront as a whole, the forces available were none too strong if attacks were pressed on any sector. There were some symptoms of prejiara-tiort for attack on the Lens and Portuguese fronts. Sir Douglas Haigpointed out that he could not take over any of the French frontuntil the situation was cleared up. He considered that no moretroops should be sent to italy , and that as many trained drafts aspossible should be sent to him, since his divisions were very weak and would have to do heavy work on the construction^, of roads andrailwavs as well as to fioht. He gave details as to the french forces on our right.8. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to the accountgiven by some newspaper correspondents at the front to the effectthat the recent German counter-attack in the Cambrai region cameas a complete surprise to our troops, and extracts were read from a despatch by the Special Corresrjondent of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;which had appeared in that paper on the 3rd December, 1917.It was pointed out that the article specifically mentioned thatthe air was full of British aircraft at the time. Dissatisfaction was expressed on two points (a.) That the fact of so complete a surprise having occurred, ifthis were correct, had not been reported to the WarCabinet, wdiich body was responsible to Parliament andthe public.In this connection it was urged that, if we had inflicted acorresponding reverse on the enemy, the news of our success wouldhave been communicated within a few hours.(6.) That such a surprise should have been inflicted on our forces if our aerial superiority was as complete as it hadbeen alleged to be, and if our defensive arrangements were properly organised.In regard to these points, it was suggested that full enquiryought to be made.The Secretary of State for War pointed out that it was evidentthat one of our divisions had been completely overwhelmed, andthat the incidents reported in such detail in the press had occurredbehind the line and after the German surprise attack had been effected. It was probable that the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chiefwas himself ignorant of&quot; the causes of this reverse, since the division affected had been broken up.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff explained the confusion and disorganisation which were inevitable when a reverse of thiskind occurred, and how great the difficulty must be of obtaining anvexact information. In reply to a reminder that a similar objectionto the paucity of news sent to the Cabinet had been made duringthe retreat from Mons, when the Cabinet had insisted on sending outLord Kitchener to visit the front and ascertain the facts, the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff pointed out that die himself, althoughpresent as Quartermaster-General of the British Expeditionary force at that time, had been quite unable to obtain information.The First Lord of the Admiralty stated that he had been atSir Douglas Haig&apos;s General Headquarters on the day after the reverse, and that the Field-Marshal himself had stated that hecould not expect to obtain details of what had happened for somedays.Attention was also called to the account given to the WarCabinet on Monday, 3rd December, 1917, by the Director of MilitaryOperations, which, though an estimate, did not at all conceal theextent of the set-back experienced (War Cabinet 289, Minute l).
Both the Secretary of State for War and the Chief of theImperial General Staff were confident that there had been no intention to minimise the extent of the reverse suffered.The War Cabinet, though prepared to leave the question ofenquiry into the question of responsibility to the Field - marshal commanding-in-Chief, felt, nevertheless, that the official telegramson the subject had not given sufficient indication of the extent ofthe reverse suffered.Attention was also called to the discrepancy between the natureof the German success and the reports which had been consistentlyreceived from pfficial sources in regard to their weakness and the deterioration of their moral.The Secretary of State for War undertook to obtain furtherreports on the subject from Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haigwhich would give the fullest detail possible.9. Sir Edward Carson informed the War Cabinet that a veryregrettable sensation, amounting almost to panic, had been caused inthe House of Commons on the previous evening by certain state-ments made by Brigadier-General Lowther, Military Secretary to theCommander-in-Chief, Home Forces, to the effect that the situation inFrance was worse than it had been at the end of 1914, and that theGermans had broken through the British line with masses of artillery.The War Cabinet were fully impressed with the undesirability,if not the actual danger, pf such action on the part of a ServiceMember.The Secretary of State for War undertook to see GeneralLowther on this subject.10. It was brought to the attention of the War Cabinet thatthe incident referred to in the preceding Minute raised the questionof the rights of Members of Parliament. The Speaker, who had been approached on the subject of holding a conference to discuss thismatter, bad given his opinion that no useful result would be reached by such a conference. It appeared that no half-measures would beof any service, and that the onlyt solution of the problem of controlling the statements of Service Members in the House was thatthey should either give up Parliament or give up the army.The Secretary of State for War stated that the case of GeneralLowther was not an isolated one, and mentioned other examples of similar conduct. This gave rise to a short discussion on the wholequestion of secrecy.Eussia: 11. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff asked for a decision the Position of the    as to what action should be taken in regard to the British Mission at british Mission.        Russian Headquarters.   He said that a telegram had been received that morning to the effect that General Barter and the militarymembers of the Mission had left Russian Headquarters for an unknown destination.The First Sea Lord, in this connection, pointed out that therewas some difficulty in communicating with Russia, since, though itwas possible to communicate with the British Ambassador at Petro-grad, he could not transmit any messages further on.The War Cabinet were fully alive to the possible danger of thesituation to all the members of the British Mission in Russia, but it did not seem that their position would be invproved if they wereordered to go to Petrograd, and, morever, the possibility of com-communicating with them was somewhat doubtful.Statements by service members in the House ofCommons.
12. The First Sea Lord reported that (a.) Two destroyers had attacked an enemy submarine, in thevicinity of the North Hinder Lightship, with depth charges, &amp;c, and that an explosion had occurred withprobably successful results ;(6.) The steamship &quot;Leithfield&quot; had attempted to ram anenemy submarine, but when the steamer was 50 yardsoff two explosions occurred on board the submarine,with unknown result.British Submarines 13. With reference to War Cabinet 279, Minute 13, the Firstin the Baltic. Lord pointed out that the Board of Admiralty were of opinion thatthe moment had now arrived when it was necessary to destroy theBritish submarines in the Baltic. He indicated certain measureswhich it was proposed to take for securing the safety of the crewsand to prevent the vessels being taken over by the Russians.The War Cabinet approved the proposed measures.14. With reference to War Cabinet 2.66, Minute II, the WarCabinet had before them the Report of the Committee on restriction of Imports (Paper G.-178) (Appendix).Lord Curzon outlined the steps that had been taken by thisCommittee, of which latterly he had been Chairman, and drew theattention of the War Cabinet particularly to paragraph 17 of theReport, in which the recommendations of the Committee were summarised.Lord Rhondda said that he wished to emphasise what was stated in paragraph 4, that the saving of 2,500,000 tons anticipatedby the Ministry of Food could only be carried into effect, providedthat absolute priority of finance and tonnage were given.After some discussion as to the various commodities to be restricted, and t he probable results as regards the different trades,the War Cabinet decided that (a,.) The report of the Committee  should  be adopted as a working basis, subject to the following amendments : (6.) Paper and pulp should be reduced by 150,000 tons, insteadof 100,000 tons recommended by the Committee (videparagraphs 6 and 17 of the Report),(c.) Tobacco should not be restricted  below the  1917 level(paragraph 13).((/.) The question of releasing men from the timber trade for theArmy (paragraph 7), as well as the related questionsdiscussed in the memorandum by the Timber Controller[1365-292]   - CTonnage Situation:Restriction ofImports.The Secretary stated that he had endeavoured on several occasions to have this question of the instructions to be sent to theBritish Mission in Russia raised at the Inter-Allied Conference at paris, without success.It was pointed out that there was a Russian Committee inLondon, under the chairmanship of M. Nabokoff, and it might bepossible to get some communication through that Committee.The War Cabinet decided that--In the circumstances, no useful instructions could be sent toGeneral Barter in regard to his Mission, and that he mustbe left to make what arrangements he could for its safety.
(Paper G.T.-2846) should be examined and decided(before the 8th December, the date of calling up), by&apos; - r;    *   &apos;   Sir Edward CarsonandMr. Barnes,after consultation with the Minister of National Serviceand the President of the Board of Trade.(e.) Cotton imports during 1918 should not be increased(paragraphs 14 and 17) until the question of usingcotton operatives and weaving sheds for aeroplane work had first been examined by the President of the Boardof Trade, who undertook, after consultation with theMinister of National Service and other GovernmentDepartments concerned, to report to the War Cabinet inclue course the result of his enquiry.(/.) The Departments concerned should be informed as to theabove decisions.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,December 5, 1917.
APPENDIX.G.-178.--RESTRICTION OF IMPORTS.Interim Report.Terms of Reference.1. BY Minute 11 of Meeting 266 of the 6th November, 1917, the War Cabinetappointed a Committee &quot; to consider to what extent and in what directions Britishimports should be further restricted, and to report their recommendations to the WarCabinet as soon as possible.&quot; -The Committee was composed as follows : Lord Milner (Chairman),Lord RhonddaMr. Long,Mr. Churchill,Sir Albert Stanley,Sir Joseph Maclay,Captain Clement Jones (Secretary).On the 27th November (War Cabinet 283, Minute 11) Lord Curzon undertook theChairmanship of the Committee in tbe absence of Lord Milner.Tonnage Situation.2. At their first meeting the Committee had before them a Memorandum by theMinistry of Shipping (Paper G.T. 2493) on the tonnage position in 1918.This Memorandum showed that if no extra assistance had to be given to theAllies, British imports in 1918 would be less than the imports in 1917 by some,000,000 tons, and that if the extra demand of the Allies for cereals amounting to over2,000,000 tons has to fall upon British shipping, the decrease in British imports mustexceed 8,000,000 tons.Before definitely accepting this deficit of 8,000,000 tons as a basis upon which towork, the Committee felt that it would be well to obtain the latest opinion and informa-tion of the Admiralty in regard to the anti-submarine campaign.Accordingly the second meeting was attended by Admiral Duff, who stated theviews of the Admiralty. He said that while any statement in regard to prospectivesubmarine losses must be purely speculative, nevertheless, in the light of their most recent information and experience, the Admiralty were of opinion that the mean of theBritish losses by submarine during September and October might be taken as a guidefor the next six months, in other words, an average of roughly 225,000 tons a month,excluding Allied and neutral vessels and ordinary marine losses and cases of damage.After that date it was reasonable to take a more optimistic view. The conditions would probably be better rather than worse, partly on account of the assistance whichwould be rendered by the United States and partly on account of the results of ourown extensive programme for countering submarine attack.The result of this improved estimate of the submarine situation, submitted by admiral Duff, as compared with the first estimate with which the Committee wereconfronted, may be translated in terms of tonnage as roughly 2,000,000 tons. Thisleaves 6,000,000 tons to be cut off British imports during 1918.X   [1365-292] D
Analysis of Imports.3. In order to arrive at our recommendations we examined seriatim a list of thevarious commodities imported in 1916 and .1917 with a view to seeing where any-further saving could he effected. We also asked the Departments concerned to submitstatements showing where reductions could be made and in each case the effect ofthe restrictions.Ministry of Food.4. The Ministry of Food provided us with a statement showing their, minimum requirements for foodstuffs in 1918. They anticipate a net saving of 2,500,000 tons,but they point out that in order to effect this reduction they must be given absolute priority of finance and tonnage.This reduction does not involve any further restriction in the output of beer belowthe present level.Ministry of Munitions.5. The Ministry of Munitions anticipated a possible reduction of 1,550,000 tons in1918. They state, however, that this cut, involving as it does a reduction of500,000 tons of shell steel from America, will seriously affect the munition programme.Paper and Paper-Making Materials.6. We have been in communication with the Paper Commission in regard to theresults of further reductions of different dimensions. They have replied in the followingsense: &quot; All users are now very short.&quot; A reduction of 100,000 tons, in addition to causing considerable scarcity for trade purposes, would necessitate cutting down newspapers, magazines, &amp;c, byone quarter.&quot;A reduction of 150,000 tons would seriously inconvenience commercial usersand require the cutting down of newspapers, magazines, &amp;c, by one-third.&quot; A reduction of 200,000 tons would cause grave dislocation of trade andentail the suppression of many newspapers and periodicals.&quot;In the light of this information, and having regard to the drastic restrictions ofother commodities which we are suggesting, we recommend that the importation of paper and paper-making materials be reduced by 100,000 tons below the 1917 level,and we hope that the War Cabinet will consider a still further reduction.Timber.7. The Board of Trade have informed us that the,importation of timber, alreadyconsiderably cut down, could be further reduced in 1918 by 1,000,000 tons.They say, however, that this additional reduction can only be realised providedthat the Minister of National Service maintains the necessary supply of labour requiredby the Timber Controller, and that no further demands are made to release men forthe Army.We therefore recommend the War Cabinet to instruct the Minister of NationalService to this effect.Wool.8. We recommend that wool imports in 1918 be reduced by 50,000 tons.We understand that there are now in the country six months&apos; stock, or 170,000 tons,including the British clip.We suggest in this connection (a.) That attention should be paid by the Departments concerned to the collection and utilisation of old clothing.(b.) That shipments of wool should be made as far as possible from the Argentinerather than Australia.Oil-seed Oake.9. We recommend that imports of oil-seed cake be reduced in 1918 by200,000 tons.
The Ministry of Food state that in the past oil-seed cake has been shipped inempty space which would otherwise have been wasted, but they raise no objection tothe reduction proposed provided that the space is used to better advantage.Stone and Slates.10. We recommend that the imiwrtation of stones and slates be reduced in 1918by 100,000 tons.Iron Ore (through reduction of iron and steel exports).11. A further reduction of 200,000 tons is recommended.Miscellaneous.12. The Board of Trade anticipate a reduction under this heading of100,000 tons.Tobacco.13. We are advised that the tobacco position is serious. We recommend that nextyear 30,000 tons representing the amount required for the troops should be imported,and that tonnage should be allocated for this purpose; but that the civilian consumption which should be met out of stocks in the country should be reduced by a cut of 25 per cent.If this plan is carried out, there will, we are informed, still be remaining, on the1st January, 1919, six months&apos; stock.Cotton.14. We had hoped that it might have been possible to recommend some reductionin cotton imports. An investigation of the situation has, however, led us to the opposite conclusion, and we are forced to recommend an increase of the import ofcotton by 50,000 tons in 1918.This will be necessary in order to maintain the cotton industry on the present60 per cent, basis.Phosphates.15. In view of the War Cabinefs decision that 50,000 tons per month are to be imported for the agricultural programme, the Committee iind that instead of areduction in 191S there will be an increase of at least 200,000 tons.Finance.16. In the course of our work we were informed that, serious as is the shipping situation at the present time, the financial difficulties are no less great.The view was expressed that in the United States of America finance is the limiting factor, and that before long, owing to financial difficulties, there will be shipswaiting in American harbours for their cargoes. It was also pointed out that one ofthe few tonnage economies that is still possible is the diversion of tonnage from distantroutes into the Atlantic.The Treasury was not represented on our Committee, and therefore we have been unable to find out how far, and where, the financial difficulties exist and may be over-come, but we are of opinion that the matter should be thoroughly investigated.Summary of Recommendations.17. To summarise : 
The Committee were confronted at their first meeting by an estimateshowing a reduction in imports in 1918 of ... ... ...This reduction may be effected in the following way : Tons.8,000,000By estimated improvement in the submarine situation,, reduction of imports of Ministry of Munitions ..,, Ministry of Food ...,, paper and pulp   ...,, timber (including pit-props),, wool&apos;,, oil-seed cake       ... ...,, stones and slates ...,, iron ore (through reduction of iron and steelexports)miscellaneous      ... ... ...,, increased imports of cotton...,,        ,,&apos; ,,       phosphatesBalanceTons.50,0001200,000 tons.2,000,0001,550,0002,500,000100,0001,000,00050,000200,000100,000200,000100,0007,800,000250,0007,550,000450,000A deficit of 450,000 tons, therefore, still remains to be wiped off before theestimated supply of, and demands upon, tonnage for our imports in 1918 can be exactlybalanced.Remaining Deficit.18. We rinclerstancl that the wdrole Allied tonnage situation is now under review at the Paris Conference, and it may well be that the conclusions of that conference will affect still further the problem of restricting imports.We therefore do not propose at the moment to finish our investigations as to thepossibility of removing the remaining deficit. We shall, however, be glad to resumeour meetings, if it is considered desirable, and examine the subject again after the paris Conference is over.The Imports of the Allies. ,19. We are well aware that the recommendations which we are now submittingwill, if carried into effect, not only cause grave dislocation to certain trades, but also involve great hardships and drastic changes in the life of the people. We believethat these burdens will be cheerfully borne, provided that some assurance can be given that our Allies are making equal sacrifices. At present we have only too muchevidence that this is not always the case.We therefore recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Government should take such steps as may be necessary to ensure equality of treatment for this country and our Allies inthese matters of economy and restriction of imports.CURZON OF IvEDLESTON, Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,December 1; 1917.
