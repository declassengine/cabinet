The attention of the War Cabinet was called to telegramNo. 759 from Sir G. Barclay, reporting the prevalence of a more hopeful feeling in Roumania, and  suggesting  that  financial,support should be promised. I12. With reference to War Cabinet 294, Minute 14, theDirector of Military Intelligence stated that he had communi-cated the decision of the War Cabinet promising assistance tothe Armenians, and had received from General Shore a telegram,to the effect that the Armenian fraternity had collected a sumof between 5 and 10 million roubles, and giving figures for thecost of mobilising 20,000 men and maintaining 40,000 men forthree months. The Director of Military Intelligence stated thatthe most valuable help in this part of the world might be expected from the Armenians, who had every reason to fight to the bitterend.The War Cabinet decided that-Sir C. Marling should be authorised to open a credit at once to help the ArmeniansThe Director of Military Intelligence undertook to make thenecessary arrangements.13. The First Sea Lord reported the following losses ofBritish airships (a.) One destroyed by an enemy seaplane or aeroplane off.the Swart Bank.(b.) One wrecked off St. Abbs.(c.) One landed at Rotterdam, owing to engine failure.14. The First Sea. Lord reported that on the 12th Decemberthe Berlin-Constantinople Railway was attacked by aircraft,trains being bombed and fired into by machine-guns.Scandinavian 15. With reference to War Cabinet 297, Minute 22, the FirstConvoy. Sea Lord reported that no definite information had yet beenreceived as to the fate of the merchant-ships that composed the scandinavian convoy referred to therein, but it was stated ina telegram from Christiania that they had been sunk, aswell as two of the German destroyers. The Germans had as yetnot issued any communique on the subject, and we should not getdefinite information from British sources until our erasersreturned to harbour, which would probably be on the following morning. Information had just been received to the effect thatthe Norwegian Government had authorised the departure ofH.M.S. &quot;Pellew.&quot;The First Sea Lord undertook to issue as full a communiqueas possible not later than Saturday, the 15th December.16. The Secretary read to the War Cabinet a telegram fromGeneral Allenby, thanking the Government, on behalf of himself and the forces under his command, for the telegram of apprecia-tion that had been sent to him, in accordance with the provisionsof War Cabinet 296, Minute 6. .The War Cabinet authorised its publication in the press.
Titles of Officersof *the Air Force.Payment ofConscientiousObjectors.18. The War Cabinet had before them the following Papers: -Memorandum by Mr. IUingworth (Paper G.T.-2708).Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (paper g.T.-2790).Memorandum by Mr. Hayes Fisher (Paper G.T.-2938).The Postmaster-General said that according to the Treasurycircular of the 10th February, 1917, conscientious objectorsexempted by Tribunals and allowed to remain on their civil duties,should receive only their former actual rate of remuneration, with-out increment, or the rate which would be paid to a temporary. substitute performing the duty, whichever was less, and their service should not count for pension or increment. About 100persons retained by the Post Office were affected. These men hadtaken advantage of their statutory rights, and were legallyexempted from military service; they were retained in the PostOffice as doing work of national importance only on the recom-mendation of the Tribunal concerned. If their wages were reduced the Trades Unions would claim that they were being sweated.The difficulty of enforcing penalties now was aggravated by thelapse of time, as some of the men concerned had been receivingfull pay for nearly 18 months. All the men were skilled, and itwould be very difficult to replace them. He did not think a strike would break out on this issue, but an adverse decision wouldcertainly tend to increase labour difficulties throughout the Service.The War Cabinet considered two courses which were open tothem if the question were raised in the House of Commons. Onthe one hand, if the policy of the Postmaster-General were adoptedit could be admitted that these men had been overlooked, that theyhad been for eighteen months in receipt of ordinary pay, and thatto reduce their pay or dismiss them now would savour of pettypersecution. On the other hand, if the Treasury circular wereenforced it could be pointed out that it was unfair to give thesemen preferential treatment when similar conscientious objectorsin other departments were suffering disabilities.The War Cabinet decided that The Postmaster-General should give notice to terminate thepresent arrangement at the end of the year, when theterms of the Treasury Circular of the 10th February,.1917, should be put into force.Recruiting ofLabour from theDominions and colonies.1.9. Writh reference to War Cabinet 168, Minute 2, the WarCabinet had before them a Memorandum on the recruiting oflabour from the Dominions and Colonies by the Ministry ofLabour (Paper G.T.-2880).17. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memo-randum (Paper G.T.-2782) by General Smuts, as to the rank andtitles of officers of the Air Force., .General Smuts explained that the Air Board had suggested a mixture of naval and military titles. The Admiralty, however,were averse to this, and suggested military titles only, or fabri-cated titles suggestive of the air. The War Office thought thatthe titles should be distinct from those which appertain eitherto the navy or the army, and further objected to the Air Board&apos;proposal, on the ground that it gave the naval titles to senior officers, and military titles to junior officers, which would be liableto cause resentment.The War Cabinet decided that The officers of the Air Force should receive militarv titles.
&amp;Sir David Shackleton stated that the decision given by theCabinet on the 22nd June, 1917, did not cover the recruiting andt&apos;importation of workmen of British nationality from theDominions, Colonies, or elsewhere abroad. At the present timelabour was being imported from the Dominions by several Depart-ments, and it was desirable that, as in the case of alien labour,there should be no possibility of competition or duplication asbetween Government Departments.Mr. Lambert said that the only caveat Mr. Long wished to .put in was that if any fresh field was to be opened up it was mostimportant that application should  be  made to the Dominionor Colonial Government affected, through the Colonial Office.Sir Auckland Geddes said it would be necessa-y that theagreement between the Ministry of National Service and the othf rDepartments should be extended so as to cover labour brought in from the Dominions and Colonies. Under these agreements allprospective bulk demands for labour by Government departments are to be notified by the Department concerned to the Ministry ofNational Service, which, jointly with the Ministry of Labour,prepares schemes to meet them; and any new scheme for recruitinglabour from the Dominions or abroad is to be agreed between theMinistry of Labour and the Ministry of National Service, theactual recruiting and transfer of such labour being carried outby the Ministry of Labour.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Ministry of Labour should become definitelyresponsible for dealing with the recruiting and im-portation of workmen of British nationality from theDominions and Colonies or elsewhere abroad, and a minute should be circulated to Government Depart-ments instructing them to consult the Ministry ofLabour, at an early stage, in connection with any proposals to recruit any such labour, and informing them that the actual work of obtaining it should beentrusted to the Minister of Labour.(b.) The agreement between the Ministry of National Service,the Ministry of Labour, and other Departments shouldbe extended so as to embrace consultation on the im-portation of the labour referred to above.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W., ,December 14, 1917.
