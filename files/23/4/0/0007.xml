September 1017.SECRET.WAR CABINET, 233.Minutes of a Meeting of the War Cabinet held at 10, Downing Street, S.W.,on Friday, September 14, 1917, at 1T30 a.m.Present:The Right Hon. A. Bonar Law, M.P. (in the Chair).The Right Hon. the Earl curzon of kedleston, K.G., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E.The Right Hon. the \*viscount Milner,G.C.B., G.C.M.G.The Right Hon. G. N Barnes, M.P.Lieutenant-General the Right Hon. J. C.SiruTS, KG.The following were also present: The Right Hon. Lord R. Cecil, K.C.,M.P., Acting Secretary of State forForeign Affairs (for Minutes 3, 7, 9, 11,and 14;.Major-General Sir G. M. W. Macdonogh,K.C.M.G., C.B., Director of military intelligence (for Minutes 1 to 4).Vice-Admiral Sir R. E.

Ormsby-Gore, M.P., Assistaiit Secretary.Colonel Sir Mark Sykes, Bart., M.P., Assistant Secretary.The Western Front. 1. THE Director of Military Intelligence reported that therehad been strong enemy attacks north of Langemarck, which hadbeen repulsed with serious losses to the enemy. An enemy raidnear Bullecourt had been driven off.The Eastern Front. 2. The Director &apos; of Military Intelligence  reported  that theRussians had turned on the Riga front and had advanced 5 or 6miles on the Riga-Pskov road, probably against weak cavalryoutposts, as no report had been received of any attempted advance by German infantry, and the force of German cavalry was small.
3. The Director of Military Intelligence called attention totelegrams No. 124, dated the 11th September, 1917, received fromGeneral Barter, and No. 1428, dated the 12th September, 1917,from Colonel Blair, which had been delayed in transmission.From General Barter&apos;s telegram it appeared that General Alexeiefand General Ivornilof were working together in complete accord.Colonel Blair called attention to the delay which had taken *place inthe Commander-in-Ckief s advance on Petrograd, which had given time for the Petrograd garrison to organise itself and for theCronstadt garrison to arrive at Petrograd. He also reported thatPutilofs works were on fire and that it was not unlikely that otherRussian munition factories would meet the same fate. GeneralMacdonogh stated that he had discouraged a suggestion made by colonel Blair that this country should organise a secret service inRussia to counter that of the Germans and help to put down sabotage.Reports had been received from the agents of the RussianGeneral Staff that though a German concentration at Libau hadtaken place, the proposed descent on the coast of Finland had been postponed owing to the failure of German propaganda in Finland.^Lord Robert Cecil stated his information to the effect that theserious problems connected with demobilisation which would con-front Russia&apos; until discipline had been restored would make itdifficult to face the prospect of a separate peace.4. The Director of Military Intelligence reported that the mainItalian position on San Gabriele had been held against Austriancounter attacks, and that there had been no material change in theposition. It was also stated that there was not likely to be a crisis in Itafy, and that from the naval point of view, owing to improvedorganisation, there might be some relief of tonnage.5. The Deputy First Sea Lord made his report on the losses by enemy submarines, showing a diminution in this respect for the last few days. He also reported that the sirbmarine which was thought to have been sunk on the 4th August had now been found bydivers, on her side with her nose in the mud.6. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that there had been some enemy aircraft activity at Dunkirk, and that we had had toabandon bombing raids on Bruges the previous night owing to the weather. He undertook to consider whether full reports of theresrdts of our raids on Bruges and elsewhere could be furnishedperiodically to the Cabinet.7. With reference to War Cabinet 232, Minute 15, dealing withMexican oil properties, the War Cabinet had before them a Memo-randum dealing with the analogous question of base metals andthe necessity of taking power to prohibit the alienation of miningproperties abroad (Paper G.T.-967), and also Paper G.T.-967A,containing the opinion of the Law Officers and Mr. G. H. Branson,on the problems raised (Appendix).Lord Robert Cecil stated that the matter was one of great urgency, and that there had been already much regrettable delay indealing with it.   There were two main difficulties : (a.) How to make the prohibition operative throughout theEmpire.(&amp;.) How to prevent alienation not only to enemy interests, but.to interests which were ostensibly Allied but were reallyGerman.
Signature to Official 8. The War Cabinet decided that Instructions should be given to Departments that documentsintended for consideration by the War Cabinet should bear the names of the writers and not merely their initials,as was often the case at present.Reported 9- With reference to War Cabinet 223, Minute 2, Lord RobertConference at Cecil stated that there had been a meeting of some kind betweenBerne. financiers at Berne, at which possibly M. Caillaux and an English-man, Mr. Kingham, an Egyptian banker, met Swiss and Frenchbankers, but from the evidence it did not seem probable that anyEnglishman had had interviews with Germans. Endeavours werebeing made to see Mr. Kingham with a view to finding out exactly what had taken place before making any public statement on thematter. If evidence was forthcoming that Englishmen had conferred with enemy subjects proceedings would be taken.Release of Men 10- ^ tetter was read from the Lords Commissioners of the from the Army for Admiralty with reference to a difference which had arisen betweenShipbuilding their Lordships and the Military Recruiting Authorities as to the yards. interpretation of War Cabinet 209, Minute 2 (g), (1), and (2).The War Cabinet decided To refer the matter for decision to Lord Milner&apos;s Man-power committee.The Future 11. The AYar Cabinet had before them a memorandum sub-Government of mitted by the Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whichEgypt. bad been drawn up by Lord Edward Cecil, the Financial adviser to the Egyptian Government, and minutes thereon by lord hardinge of Penshurst and Sir Ronald Graham.Lord Robert Cecil stated that when he first went to the ForeignOffice he, found considerable difficulty in getting papers dealingwith Egypt, there being no proper organisation in the Foreign office for obtaining any knowledge of, or dealing with, the many internalmatters of Egyptian government. The main channels of com-mimication with Egypt were private letters between Sir ReginaldWingate and Lord Hardinge. Lord Robert Cecil had consideredthe desirability of handing over the control of Egypt to some otheroffice, such as the Colonial Office, but there appeared to be no existing office suitable. His brother, Lord Edward Cecil, camehome in the spring to take up military duty, and informed him that from the Egyptian side he thought that there must be a lack of organisation at the British end, not so much in matters diplomaticas in matters administrative. Lord Robert Cecil stated that he feltconsiderable anxiety regarding this situation from the Parliamentarypoint of view. Supposing there were trouble in Egypt, we should haveThe German metal-buying combination controlled vast quanti-ties of metals through American Companies. It was probable thatany action taken by this country would meet with support in theDominions.The War Cabinet decided that Counsel to the Board of Trade should be asked to prepare thedraft of a General Regulation, under the Defence of the realm Act, to prohibit British subjects in the UnitedKingdom from parting with mining and oil interestswithout a licence.
to take responsibility before the House of Commons, and to defendactions concerning the circumstances of which we had no knowledge.The whole position was irregular, and was the result of a system which had worked well in the days of Lord Cromer, when Egyptwas nominally a Turkish province and we were merely advisers,but which could not possibly survive under the altered conditionsof a British Protectorate and the growth of the demand fordemocratic control.Sir Ronald Graham in his minute admitted that there must be large changes in the Egyptian Government as soon as martial lawcame to an end. Lord Robert Cecil pointed out that complicatedlegal matters were at this moment under consideration. In view ofthe fact that Egypt was becoming more and more the centre through which not merely Egypt, but the whole of Arabia and possiblyPalestine and Mesopotamia would be managed, he regarded thematter as important and urgent, and suggested that a Committeeshould be established forthwith to investigate the whole question.Ee had thought that the question might be referred to the existingMiddle-Eastern Committee, but was of opinion now that thisCommittee was far too big to deal satisfactorily with the matter.Lord Curzon pointed out that the development of affairs in theNear and Middle East pointed to the possibility that an entirely new Department of State might become necessary. This Depart-ment could not be entirety separate from the Foreign Office, as manydiplomatic questions gravitated round Egypt ; for instance, the newindependent Kingdom of Hedjaz. Lord Edward Cecil&apos;s paperraised the whole question of what we were accustomed to call theMiddle East question, and how it was to be dealt with. A newgrouping of countries was involved, with the attendant alteration of conditions, and the resulting problem could not be regarded asmerely administrative.Lord Milner stated that, from his own personal knowledge ofEgypt, it was impossible to continue the existing system. he understood that great changes were going on in the egyptian government to-day of which he had no knowledge, and theestablishment of our Protectorate made the reconsideration of thewhole problem urgent. What was required was that what was going on inside Egypt should be known here, and to some extentcontrolled.Mr. Barnes added that, from the Labour point of view, it was most desirable that he should be in a position to communicate tothe more responsible Labour Leaders the British policy in the near and Middle East, as up to the present the manifesto of theIndependent Labour Party, which was demonstrably unsound, held the field.The War Cabinet cleeided that -A Committee, composed as follows:  Mr. Balfour (Chairman),Lord Curzon,Lord Milner,should be set up forthwith to examine all the points raised in Lord Edward cecils Memorandum, and report to theWar Cabinet. .Lord Curzon, the Chairman of the Middle-Eastern Committee,undertook to provide a statement of the work of theCommittee, including a general statement of British andEntente policy in the Middle East for the information ofMr. Barnes.Quicker turn round of Ships.12.

The War Cabinet concurred in the issue of the following-notice by the Press Bureau, subject to the approval of the.HomeSecretary &quot; The attention of the Press is invited to Serial D. 352 ofthe 2nd February, 1916, and it is requested that, in publishingreports of inquests On, or funerals of sailors or soldiers killed in air raids, the fact that the victim was a sailor or soldier shouldnot be stated or implied. All the other provisions of the instruction of the 2nd February, 1916, remain in force. Photo-graphs of military funerals of victims of air raids cannot bepublished.&quot;14. With reference to War Cabinet 226, Minute 12, lord robert Cecil called the attention oi the War Cabinet to telegramNo. 284S from Sir W. Townley, dated the 13th September, 1917,Avhich indicated that Austria&apos;s reply to the Pope&apos;s Peace proposals will not reveal her real views, because it will afford no opening for peace negotiations by the Allies. It was suggested that, before making peace, Germany is anxious to conclude a binding economictreaty with Austria, Bulgaria, and Turkey. The opinion of theAustrian Minister was given that Italy might be detached from theAllies by an offer of the Austrian territory she covets, and that if italy went out of the war France would follow suit, and, as Russiacould be neglected, oidy England and America would remain to bedealt with.Lord Robert Cecil thought that it might be part of the diplomaticcampaign to entice this country into secret negotiations with Austria,so that Austria might then go to Italy and use the negotiations that were going on to persuade Italy to make peace.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,September 14, 1917.13 6 5-233]Cwortli&apos;s Committee on the Quicker Turn Round of Ships (paper g.T.-2019;, and of Lord Curzon&apos;s decision that the Committee be discontinued.
APPENDIX,G.T. 967 a. -BASE METALS,THERE is a danger of valuable mining properties at present in British ownershipin neutral countries passing under the control of American groups whose interests arein reality centred in Germany through the affiliation to the great German MetalCombine.At present no powers exist to prevent British companies from selling their interests in such properties to any neutral.In view of the importance of conserving as far as possible such interests as we doat present possess in the world&apos;s resources of base metals, and of the avowed intentionof the Germans to mate good by the purchase of mining properties in neutral countries the loss of the raw materials for which they were formerly dependent on the BritishEmpire, it is desirable that some control over the sale by the British companies of theirmining properties abroad should, if possible, be established.An account of the present situation with concrete instances of transactions whichit is desirable to check will be found in the accompanying memorandum.The sanction of the War Cabinet is asked for the preparation of a measure giving his Majesty&apos;s Government power to prohibit the alienation to foreigners of miningproperties abroad owned by British subjects unless the consent of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment has first been obtained.(Initialled) G. M. P.June 5, 1917.The war has made public property a fact which, prior to 1914, was only perhapsrealised by those directly connected with mining and smelting businesses, i.e., that german mining and smelting combines, chiefly with their seat at Frankfurt, havegradually secured such a chain of organisations in various countries that they practicallydominate the base metal industry of the world. The war appears to have scarcelyaffected this control, with the exception, perhaps of Australia, where stringent legislation has freed the metal industries of the Commonwealth from German domination. Itappears incredible that, under present-day conditions, German companies are still in aposition to acquire and control British-owned properties, but they are still attempting to do so (and in some cases no doubt have succeeded) through the German-american companies in the United States, with which they are closely affiliated, in which theyhold capital, and are represented in many cases thrqugh interlocking directorates.The accompanying chart, which has been extracted from the &quot; Report onCo-operation in American Export Trade,&quot; published in 1916 by the United StatesGovernment, shows very graphically the close connection existing between the Frankfurtcompanies and the German-American metal organisations of the United States.The American Metal Company, with a capital of 700,000?.. is closely affiliated, asthe chart shows, with the Metall-Gesellschaft of Frankfurt, with a capital of 900,O00L,and also with the Metallbank und Metallurgische Gesellschaft, also of Frankfurt,capital 2,000,0002.It is said that a large part of the stock of the American Metal Company is heldby the two German companies, and these latter are therefore understood to have adirect voice, if not a control, in its management.There are other large German metal combines, such as Beer, Sondheimer, AronHirsch und Sohn, which have extensive ramifications in the United States, and it maybe said, therefore, that the German metal companies, in spite of the state of warexisting to-day, are free to pursue their endeavours, under the shelter of their affiliatedAmerican groups, to capture important British and other mining properties throughoutthe world.The American Metal Company has been, and is, very actively engaged in buyingup mining companies in the American continent, and two cases have recently come tothe notice of His Majesty&apos;s Government in which British owners have asked theForeign Trade Department if there was any objection to their accepting favourableoffers which they have received for their properties from the American Company.One of these properties was in Chile, of relatively small importance, but the other,
situated in Mexico, was of greater value. It belongs to the Mazapil Copper Company(Limited), an English company with a capital of 500,000L, and the offer receivedfrom the American company amounted to some 1,300,0001. Both the properties inquestion consist of copper mines, which it is of great importance to keep under british control owing to the comparatively poor resources of the British Empire asregards this metal. With regard to the offer received by the Mazapil CopperCompany, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington reported that the sale- shouldbe prevented by every available means, as by its acquisition the American MetalCompany would practically complete their hold on the production of base metals inthe northern districts of Mexico.A letter lately intercepted by the censor states that recent German activities inMexican mines have as an object &quot; to replace into German hands those metals whichthey were getting before the war from the British and their colonies.&quot;In order effectively to counter the schemes of the German organisations to dominate the world&apos;s base metal supply, it would appear to be necessary to oppose it bya similar combination of the large base metal interests throughout the Empire, and itis understood that the Board of Trade is at present considering the steps to be taken tosecure such a fusion of interests. With such a combination it would not only bepossible to check the German activities, but a British combine of the magnitudecontemplated would have sufficient power in capital and output to compete successfullywith the American organisations, and would be in a position to oiler at least equalprices for the acquisition of important new properties, and be able to keep a staff of engineers in different parts of the world reporting on opportunities for the investment of the capital resources of the combine. It is only by such an organisation that GreatBritain and her colonies will be able to check and defeat what threatens to become a German domination, and the consequent fixing of prices of the world&apos;s base metalsupply.In the meantime it is obviously of the greatest importance to prevent British-owned properties passing out of British control into that of the German-American andother groups. His Majesty&apos;s Government, however, do not at present possess powerstinder which such sales can be prevented, and, in the two cases cited above, all the actionit was possible to take was necessarily confined to an urgent request to the directorsnot to accept, on patriotic grounds, what to them were undoubtedly very favourableoffers.It is certainty a matter of extreme urgency that this unsatisfactory situation shouldbe remedied with a view to creating a powerful British organisation for the future, andtherefore that steps may be taken with the least possible delay to give His Majesty&apos;sGovernment the necessary power to secure by law that the approval of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment must be obtained for the sale or alienation to foreigners of any british-owned mining property or of the controlling interest in such property,wherever situated.(Initialled) G. M. P.June 5, 1910.Defence of the Realm Regulations.Transfer of British Interests in Mines to Foreigners.Opinion of the Law Officers of the Grown and Mr. G. A. II. Branson.We perfectly understand the object which the Board of Trade desires to attain,but we are of opinion that it cannot be attained by making a Regulation. The main difficulty in our opinion is that the rule making power conferred upon His Majesty inCouncil by the Defence of the Realm Acts is limited to legislating for the defence ofthe Realm. Regulations therefore are only valid if and so far as they are directed to this end. Regulation 30 BB as, it stands would, in our opinion, be difficult, if not impossible, to bring within the powers of the Act, for it prevents the transfer of an
interest even to an alien who is an ally. A Regulation designed not for assisting inthe prosecution of the present war, but to prevent the acquisition by Germans ofcontrol of mines which they could exercise to our detriment only after the conclusionof peace would in our opinion be clearly ultra vires. If, however, it can be quite clearly shown that there is a present and substantial danger of mining interests getting into enemy control through sales to alien (allies or neutrals), and of their being usedduring the war to stop or hamper our supplies of metal for war purposes, then, in ouropinion, a regulation to prevent such sales maybe justified, and if so, Regulation 30 BBshould be amended by making the last paragraph read &quot; mines wherever situated,&quot;instead of &quot; mines situated in the United Kingdom.&quot;It should be borne in mind that the power to make Regulations is for exercise inthe United Kingdom only (except in reference to navigation), and the Regulationwould not make it an offence for anyone in any other part of the Empire to sell his interest to an alien.(Signed) FREDERICK SMITH.GORDON HEWART.G. A. H. BRANSON.Laic Officers&apos; Department,August 8, 1917.
