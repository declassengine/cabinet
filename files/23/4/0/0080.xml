The War Cabinet considered the question of supplying gas-masks to the population of London.Lord Derby said that to provide gas-masks for London wouldinvolve a heavy drain on the supply lor tbe Army, and that in anycase it would be almost impossible to train the London population t9put on their masks, even if they had them.-306J B

One German division had arrived in flanders from Russia, making in all a total of 154 enemy divisions on the Western front.

The Director of Military Intelligence reported that there hadbeen a heavy attack by the Austrians to the east of the AsiagoPlateau. The enemy reported the capture of 9,000 italian prisoners.

Bombing -Raid.Russia: Reportof conference with FrenchGovernment.General Policy.Small States.Recall of BritishMissions.3 W.C. 306.12. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that a successfulbombing raid had been carried out on Bruges Docks, St. DenisWestrem Aerodrome, and Ghistelles Aerodrome. All our machines had returned safely.13. With reitrence to War Cabinet 304, Minute 10 (a), lord robert Cecil submitted a memorandum, prepared by Lord Milnerand himself, on &quot; Suggested Policy in Russia,&quot; which had beenaccepted by M. Clemenceau on the ^3rd December (Appendix). he stated that Lord Milner, General Macdonogh, and he had beenreceived at the Quai d&apos;Orsay on Sunday morning last byMM. Clemenceau and Pichon and General Foch. The british representatives explained the difficulty in which the Cabinet found themselves, and M. Clemenceau stated that he had no furtherinformation to go upon, but that he was quite decided that we must continue to give support to the Ukraine and other Governments inthe South of Russia, while at the same time we should maintainunofficial agents at Petrograd. M. Clemenceau -accepted theproposals set forth in the memorandum on behalf of the FrenchGovernment, and further agreed that a French officer should direct the Allied activities in the Ukraine; the Armenian, Cossack, andCaucasus countries being similarly allotted as the British sphere of activity. But as the French had already agreed to advance100,000,000 fr. to General Alexeieff through General Berthelot, thiswas to be allowed to go on. It was thought that the French mightbe able to raise money through the branches of the Credit Lyonnaisat Kieff and Odessa.The War Cabinet approved the policy laid down in thememorandum prepared by Lord Milner and Lord Robert Cecil,and accepted by M. clemenceau, with the addition of a paragraphregarding the obligation of honour which Russia had towards Serbia,the in paragraph regarding representations to be made tc theBolsheviki.14. General Macdonogh stated that M. Strepankonski, a repre-sentative of the Ukrainian Bureau in Switzerland, was now in thiscountry and had seen him that moiming, informing him that greatprogress was taking place in Russia in regard to the formation ofnew small nations; for instance, the White Russians, wrho inhabitedthe country to the north of the Ukraine, round Minsk, were forming a separate Government and looked forward to the formation of aseparate army. General Macdonogh gathered that the Ukrainianswere most anxious to avoid exploitation by the Germans, and that,although they had been friendly with Austria in the past, they had now quarrelled, owing to the proposed amalgamation of EasternGalicia, which was largely a Ukrainian country, with Poland.General Macdonogh also reported that the French were advancingmoney to the Poles, with a view to assisting the formation of polish corps. The Poles were not altogether friendly towards theUkrainians, but there&apos; appeared to be a definite breach between thePoles and the Bolsheviks.15. The War Cabinet then considered what action, if any, shouldbe taken with regard to the withdrawal of British personnel now inRussia, and discussed the selection of someone to act as Charged&apos;Affaires in Petrograd.   They decided that (a.) General Knox should accompany Sir George Buchanan onhis return to this country, if the latter concurred.(6.) Every effort should be made to utilise in South Russia the personnel of the British missions now in Russia, and&apos; that for the present they should  not be  withdrawnaltogether from the country.[1365-306]B2
16. Mr. Churchill stated that the Ministry of Munitions were doing all they could to damp down the production of Russian warmaterial, but that they did not at present propose to regard Russia asan entirely &quot;gone&quot; concern, so that it seemed desirable to keep a nucleus going in order that the production of material for russia might be restored in the event of a change taking place in thesituation.17. Lord Robert Cecil stated that a further meeting took placeon Sunday afternoon, at which certain other matters besides Russiawere touched upon by M. Clemenceau, who requested that theyshould be communicated as early as possible to the British WarCabinet: (a.) M. Clemenceau repeated his anxiety regarding the conditionof the trenches on the Western front, and stated that. be had recalled 270,000 men to the colours for thepurpose, not of fighting, but of digging trenches. he hoped that the British Government would use their best endeavours to secure an improvement in the defensive&apos; system behind their present front.(o.) M. Clemenceau urged the creation of a joint reserve,composed of both French and British elements, for useat any point where the Germans made a big attack.M. Clemenceau did not think that such an attack would take place for another three or four months, butconsidered it essential that a mobile reserve, undercomplete unity of direction, should be created mean-while. He suggested that the attainment of this unity of direction should be considered jointly by Sir douglas haig and General Petain.(c.) M. Clemenceau requested the British Government to con-sider a document submitted by Major Sevigny regardingthe Italian front. This document proposed to create an italian Generalissimo, who should be a figure-head, andwho should be in supreme command of all the allied forces in Italy, and who would have an Allied GeneralStaff with a French officer at the&apos; head of it. M. Clemen-Clemenceau did not wish to pin himself to the proposals of the document, but hoped the British Government wouldgive them their careful consideration.(d.) M. Clemenceau expressed continued anxiety regarding thequestion of transportation, and hoped that it would bepossible to achieve real co-ordination on this question.Lord Robert Cecil added that he gathered that M. Clemenceaunow regarded as impracticable the question of a Generalissimo for thewhole of the Allied forces on the Western front.18. The Prime Minister asked whether the prosecution ofM. Caillaux had produced any serious effect in France.Lord Robert Cecil replied that he understood from a british officer who had heard M. Caillaux&apos;s speech in the Chamber on saturday last that the latter, though a fine rhetorical effort, was nota real success, and that it would not stand cross-examination.Sir Eric &quot;Geddes observed that the German, press had been ordered to make no reference to the Caillaux trial.
5W.C. 306.A Loyal Russian 19. Mr. Churchill said he understood that a number of RussianUnit. officers were most anxious to be kept together, either in France orEngland, as a Russian unit to form a rallying-point for those Russianswho remained loyal to the Entente. In bis opinion such a nucleusAvould be a valuable political asset.Lord Derby stated, in this connection, that General Yermiloffhad made certain definite proposals of this character to the WarOffice, but that his proposals were not practical, as they included a request that Russian officers should be allowed to serve as Russianofficers in or with the British Army. This was statutoriiyinadmissible, as the War Office were prevented by the Act of settlement from taking any foreigners into the British Army.General   Macdonogh   stated that   he   feared   the   Russian; troops in France were of little or no fighting value.    About 3,000of them had been transferred to North Africa, while the restwere being employed in labour battalions for the purpose ofdigging trenches. He understood that the French Ambassador inPetrograd had wired to his Government stating that a number ofRussian officers now in Russia desired to volunteer for the purposeof assisting the French arm v.Sir Eric Geddes stated that Admiral Rostock, who had until recently commanded the Black Sea Fleet, had offered his services tothis country, and that he had been informed by the Admiralty thatif he and his officers could bring crews with them to this country wewould place vessels at their disposal which they could man.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,December 27, 1917.APPENDIX.Memorandum prepared by Lord Milner and Lord R. Cecil on Suggested Policy in Russia,and accepted by M. Clemenceau and M. Pichon on December 23, 1917.AT Petrograd we should at once get into relations with the Bolsheviki throughunofficial agents, each country as seems best to it.We propose to send Sir George Buchanan on leave for reasons of health, but weshall keep a Charge dAffaires there. We do not suggest that our Allies should followour example. Sir George Buchanan&apos;s long residence in Petrograd has indeliblyassociated him, in the minds of the Bolsheviki, with the policy of the Cadets, and hestands to them, for much the same as, say, M. Miliukoff.We should represent to the Bolsheviki that we have no desire to take part in anyway in the internal politics of Russia, aud that any idea that we favour a counter-revolution is a profound mistake. Such a policy might be attractive to the autocraticGovernments of Germany and Austria, but not to the Western democracies or America.But we feel it necessary to keep in touch as far as we can with the Ukraine, theCossacks, Finland, Siberia, the Caucasus, &amp;c, because these various semi-autonomousprovinces represent a vt J large proportion of the strength of Russia. In particular, we feel bound to befriend the Ukraine, since upon the Ukraine depends the feeding of the roumanians, to whom we are bound by every obligation of honour.As for the war, we should carefully refrain from any word or act condoning thetreachery of the Russians in opening peace negotiations with our enemies. But weshould continually repeat our readiness to accept the principles of self-determination,and, subject to that, of no annexation or indemnities. We should press on theBolsheviki the importance of not being satisfied with empty phrases from the Germans,and point out that unless they get specific undertakings from them as to such questions as Poland, Bohemia, the Roumanian parts of Transylvania, not to speak of Alsace-Lorraine and the Trentino, they will get nothing. Meanwhile their powers of resistanceare melting away, and they will soon be, if they are not now, at the mercy of theGerman Kaiser, who will then snap his fingers at all their fine phrases and impose on
them any terms he pleases. They should be told that it is now probably too la-te to do any-thiug to save the personnel of the army. But the material of the artillery can stillbe preserved, and at the very least it should not be transferred to our enemies to be used against the Western democracies. Most important of all, the Bolsheviki should prevent,if they can, the wheat districts of Eussia, such as the Ukraine, falling into the controlof or being made available for the Central Powers. &apos; This makes another reason why weare anxious to support and strengthen the Ukraine, and why we urge on the Bolshevikithat, so far from trying to coerce the Ukrainians, they should enter into close co-operationwith them.In Southern Russia our principal object must be, if we can, to save Roumania..Next we must aim at preventing Russian supplies from reaching Germany.Finally, we are bound to protect, if possible, the remnant of the Armenians, notonly iu order to safeguard the flank of our Mesopotamia!! forces in Persia and iheCaucasus, but also because unless an Armenian, united, if possible, with a Georgian,autonomous, or independent State, is the only barrier against the development of aTuranian movement that will extend from Constantinople to China, and will provideGermany with a weapon of even greater danger to the peace of the world than thecontrol of the Bagdad Railway.If we could induce the Southern Russian armies to resume the fight, that wouldbe very desirable, but it is probably impossible. To secure these objects the first thing ismoney to reorganise the Ukraine, to pay the Cossacks and Caucasian forces, and tobribe the Persians. The sums required are not, as things go, very enormous, but theexchange presents great difficulties. If the French could undertake the finance of theUkraine, we might find the money for the others. It is understood that the UnitedStates will assist.Besides finance it is important to have agents and officers to advise and supportthe provincial Governments and their armies. It is essential that this should be done as quietly as possible so as to avoid fhe imputation as far as we can that we are preparing to make war on the Bolsheviki.We would suggest that the Ukraine should be again, in this matter, dealt with bythe French, while we would take the other south-east provinces. A general officerfrom each country would be appointed to take charge of our respective activities, butthey would of course keep in the closest touch with one another through carefully selected liaison officers in order to ensure the utmost unity of action.It is for consideration whether we should facilitate the return to Southern Russiaof tbe numerous Russian officers at present in France and England.Paris, December 22, 1917.o
