General Wilson added that we were doing all wepossibly could, but there was certainly no time to spare. The Chiefof the Imperial General Staff stated that the French intended tosend two more Divisions to Italy.

The War Cabinet decided that Such procedure was desirable, and requested the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs to communicate with the FrenchGovernment, pointing out that, in their opinion, it was desirable that both General Wilson and General Fochshould now return to take over their duties in connectionwith the Inter-Allied Supreme War Council, and that we proposed to instruct General Wilson in this sense as soonas we hear that the French Government agree.General Cadorna. 6.

Ministry of Food:Office Aecommo-dation.War priorities committee.economic offensive :Control of Shippingafter the War.Crown, and give a decision as to the points raised by theArmy Council, communicating such decision to the WarCabinet and the Army Council.14. With reference to War Cabinet 269, Minute 10, the W*war cabinet  had under consideration a Report by a Committee of which mr. Barnes was Chairman, as to further accommodation being provided for the Ministry of Food in connection with the schemefor distributing sugar.Mr. Barnes pointed out that the Secretary of State for theColonies had been unable to be present, but that he had writtensaying that he was a trustee for His Majesty&apos;s Government and theDominions and Crown Colonies in regard to the Imperial Institute,and could not share this responsibility, adding that if the Cabinetgave a decision in favour of the Imperial Institute being so used, hewould, of course, be free to state the facts to the Dominions. Mr.Barnes stated that Lord Rhondda had pointed out the urgency ofthe matter, and that the Committee over which Mr. Barnes hadpresided had concurred as to the allocation of the Imperial Institutefor the purpose named.The War Cabinet requested Mr. Barnes, before taking the action he recommended, to confer with Mr. W. A. S. Hewins, so as to ascertain in detail theviews of the Colonial Office on the subject.15. The War Cabinet had under consideration the Minutes ofthe Second Meeting (Paper G.T.-246S), the Third Meeting (paper g.T.-2510), and the Fourth Meeting (G.T.-2495), of the war priorities Committee, together with a note by the Minister ofMunitions and the Admiralty reply thereto (Paper G.T.-2584), their particular attention being drawn to the following recommendationsof the Committee : (a.) The Reduced Airship Programme and the Aeroplane Pro-gramme, viz., 200 squadrons to be completed by the endof 1918, to have priority after the Shipbuilding Pro-gramme.(6.) A completion of the two aircraft programmes is sufficientlyimportant to justify a reduption in the output of othermunitions, e.g., shell and rails.(c.) That the Minister of National Service should become aMember of the War Priorities Committee.They also took note of the desire of the Committee to know whetherit was the intention of the War Cabinet that a supreme effort tobring the war to an end was to be made in 1918, or whether pro-vision should be made for the prolongation of the war into 1919, andafter.The War Cabinet, while taking particular note of Mr. ChurchiU&apos;sobjection to the Reduced Airship Programme, confirmed the various recommendations of the War Priorities Committee, as set forth inthe above papers.16. Sir Edward Carson brought before the War Cabinet theFourth Interim Report of the Economic Offensive Committee,dealing with the control of shipbuilding [after the war (paper g.-170).

Chinese Pioneer 17. With reference to War Cabinet 260, Minute 4, the WarBattalions for the     Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the First Lord of theWestern Front.        Admiralty  (Paper  G.T.-2560), and a letter from the   ShippingController (Paper G.T.-2596), dealing with the question of transportof Chinese Pioneer Battalions to France.The Shipping Controller pointed out that he had no objectionto the use of Chinese or Japanese tonnage for the purpose indicated,but he made it clear that British tonnage could not be allocated.The First Lord stated that whichever of the three routes were used, namely, the Port Said route, the Trans-American route, or the cape route, it woidd not be possible to provide a special Britishescort, though it might be possible to fit the vessels bringing theChinese Pioneer Battalions into one of our own convoys. Since no special escort could be provided by British craft, he was of opinionthat it should be made clear to the French Government that theyshould co-operate in providing the escorting vessels.The War Cabinet decided that The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should reply to general foch that His Majestys Government would support theproposal to employ Chinese Pioneer Battalions up to thenumber of forty battalions on the Western Front, providedthat the French Government employed either French,Chinese, or Japanese tonnage. His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould be unable to provide special escorts. Therefore,unless the transports bringing the Chinese could be fittedinto British convoys, it would be necessary for the FrenchGovernment to provide the escort.Supply of Oats to 18. The War Cabinet had before them a letter from Sir E.the Italian Army. Wyldbore Smith (Paper G.T.-2543), in which it was suggested, inview of the serious situation in Italy, that as many cargoes aspracticable, new on their way from the United States of America tothis country with oats for the British Army, should he diverted toItaly, the oats thus transferred to Italy to be replaced from stocks in this country. - *The Quartermaster-General pointed out that, owing to shortageof shipping, our reserves in France had been greatly reduced, andthat as regards oats our supplies were down about 12,0()0 tons. Itwould not therefore be possible to divert to Italy cargoes now ontheir way from the United States of America unless our stocks inFrance could be replenished from supplies in this country.The Minister of Blockade said that he felt obliged to repeatagain what he had stated to the War Cabinet previously (WarCabinet 266, Minute 11). He considered that, in order to keepItaly in the War, it was absolutely necessary to supply her needs,and he attributed the Italian debacle in some measure to their failure to obtain sufficient tonnage. He pointed out that unless oats were sent to Italy the Italian Cavalry would be immobilised.The Prime Minister pointed out that, in the existing strategicalposition of the Italian Army, the maintenance of their transport was of great importance to the whole Alliance.-    [13G5---273] CIt was mentioned that Colonel House had expressed the viewthat the United States Government would look with favour on anEconomic Offensive.The War Cabinet approved the Report of the economic offensive Committee, the recommendation that a statement should be made at an early date, that Regulations shouldbe published under the Defence of the Realm Act, and aBill introduced on the lines of the draft outline presented by the Committee.
Lord Derby stated, on the other hand, that if we send oats toItaly instead of to France, our horses in France would starve.It was stated that there are large stocks of oats both in thiscountry and in Ireland which could be sent to France if tonnagewere forthcoming.The War Cabinet decided that  *If the Shipping Controller could supply tonnage to conveyBritish oats across the Channel, then a correspondingamount of oats should be diverted to Italy that would otherwise have come from the United States of Americafor the British Army.Dutch Shipping inUnited StatesWaters.19. The Minister of Blockade informed the War Cabinet thathe had been notified that the United States Mission were proposing to urge their Government to requisition all the Dutch ships atpresent in United States harbours. He asked whether thisrequisitioning had the support of the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet approved the proposal.The Order of theBritish Empire.20. With reference to War Cabinet 262, Minute 1, the WarCabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the Earl ofCrawford and Balcarres (Paper G.T.-2577) as to the control and organisation of the Order of the British Empire.Lord Crawford explained to the War Cabinet the views as setout in his Memorandum.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Prime Minister should be free and unfettered inadding to the list the names of persons who would notbe covered by the recommendations of the Departments,and as he is ultimately responsible to His Majesty forthe complete list of names submitted he retains the absolute light to make whatever changes he thinksproper in the list as a whole.(b.) The Home Office should act as the central office for allwork in connection with the Order up till the actualgazetting of the names.(c.) The^cbancery^work jihoukA^e entrusted to the CentralReg^ste^ of^rders^atlSk Ja&apos;mes&apos;s Palace.(d.) Lord Crawford, in conjunction with the Secretary of Statefor Home Affairs, should draw up such provisionalrules as may prove necessary for the Order, to be laidbefore His Majesty.(e.) In due course the Prime Minister should submit finalstatutes for His Majesty&apos;s approval.Inter-AlliedSupreme Council.21. The War Cabinet had under consideration a question thatwas to be asked by Mr. Asquith as to the functions of the Inter-Allied Supreme Council.The Prime Minister explained that there was no intention thatthe Military Advisory Council should have the right to override theMilitary Staff of the several Governments or the Commanders-in-Chief in the field ; neither should it have a separate intelligence and Operations Division ; and that, as regards Intelligence, provi-sion had been made for all information to be furnished by theseveral War Offices to the military representatives, and that all theMilitary Council would require would be a co-ordinating Staff.As regards Government control, this remained in the hands ofthe several Governments ; in fact, the proposed Council would nothave been agreed to by the French and Italian Governments if they
had been deprived of the right of making final decisions. colonel house had stated that the United States Government would hold asimilar view. The Prime Minister explained that the procedure would be somewhat as follows : (a.) The Advisory Military Council would prepare a combinedplan of operations, based on the plans of the severalGeneral Staffs.(b.) This would be referred to the General Staff of the severalAllies for their remarks,(c.) The proposals referred to in (c) and (6) would then beconsidered by the several Governments, and two membersof each would then be given a brief on which to work atthe meeting of the Supreme Council.As regards the attendance of the Military Advisers of therespective Governments at the meetings, the War Cabinet were ofopinion that the circumstances of the moment and the subjectsunder discussion by the Council must be the guide as to whatmilitary officials should attend in an advisory capacity, and that asmuch elasticity should prevail in this respect as is possible.The text of Mr. Asquith&apos;s question, and the reply as approvedby the War Cabinet, are printed in the Appendix.2, Whitehall Gardens, 3. W.,November 14, 1917.
APPENDIX.&quot;Mr. Asquith: I beg to ask the Prime Minister a question of which I have given him Private Notice  &quot;   eWhether he will now state to the House what are the precise functions of theproposed Inter-Allied Council, and in particular of its Military Staff;Whether it is proposed that the Council is, if so advised by its Staff, to have powerto interfere with or override the opinion on matters of strategy of the General Staff athome, and of the Commanders-in-Chief in the field ;Whether the Military Staff of the Inter-Allied Council is to have Intelligence and operations Departments, or either of them, of its own ;Whether the ultimate decision as to the distribution and movements of the variousArmies in the field is to rest with the Council, or with the Governments representedupon it;And whether an early opportunity will be given to the House for discussing theproposed arrangements and the statements made in connection therewith in the PrimeMinisters Paris speech ?The Prime Minister (Mr. Lloyd George) : The best way for me to answer thisquestion is to read to the House the actual terms of the agreement between the French,Italian, and British Governments for the creation of a Supreme War Council for theAllies.1. With a view to the better co-ordination of military action on the Western Front,a Supreme War Council is created, composed of the Prime Minister and a Member ofthe Government of each of the Great Powers whose Armies are fighting on that front.The extension of the scope of the Council to other fronts is reserved for discussion withthe other Great Powers.2. The Supreme War Council has for its mission to watch over the generalconduct of the War. It prepares recommendations for the decision of the Governments,and keeps itself informed of their execution, and reports thereon to the respective governments.3. The General Staffs and Military Commands of the Armies of each Powercharged with the conduct of military operations remain responsible to their respective governments.4. The general War plans drawn up by the competent military authorities are submitted, to the Supreme War Council, which, under the high authority of theGovernments, ensures their concordance, and submits, if need be, any necessary changes.5. Each Power delegates to the Supreme War Council one permanent military representative, whose exclusive function is to act. as techhical adviser to the Council.0. The Military Representatives receive from the Government and the competentmilitary authorities of their country all the proposals, information and documents relating to the conduct of the War.7. The Military Representatives watch day by day the situation of the Forces, andthe means of all kinds of which the Allied Armies and the Enemy Armies dispose.8. The Supreme War Council meets normally at Versailles, where the permanent military Representatives and their Staffs are established. They may meet at other places as maj- be agreed upon, according to the circumstances. The meetings of theSupreme War Council will take place at least once a month.From the foregoing it will be clear that the Council will have no executive power,and that the final decisions in matters of strategy and as to the distribution and movements of the various Armies in the field will rest with the several Governments ofthe Allies. There will, be, therefore, no Operations Department attached to theCouncil. The permanent Military Representatives will derive from the existingIntelligence Departments of the Abies all the information necessary in order to enablethem to submit advice to the Supreme Allied Council. The object of the Allies hasbeen to set up a central body charged with the duty of continuously surveying thefield of operations as a whole and, by the light of information derived from all frontsand from all Governments and Staffs, of co-ordinating the plans prepared by thedifferent General Staffs, and, if necessary, of making proposals of their own for the better conduct of the War. Should the House desire an opportunity of discussing this important subject and my Paris speech, the Government would propose to set asideMonday next for the purpose.
