THE War Cabinet had before them two telegrams from italy. General Sir Henry Wilson, setting out his appreciation of thesituation on the Italian front.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff thought that theItalians should be in a position to hold the line of the Piave,provided their flank was not turned from the north and north-west.He explained upon a map the importance of the Asiago plateau andof the Montello hill, which positions, if occupied by the enemy,would threaten the Piave line. He stated that General Foch had agreed that the French troops should go to Vicenza, and, in theevent of their doing so, our troops, who were detraining at Mantua,would be available to take the place of the French at Brescia if need be. He gathered that the Italian Staff still estimated thenumber of German divisions being employed? as twenty-one ; he had asked for the numbers of these divisions, but these&apos;had not yet beenforthcoming. General Foch was of opinion that not more than nine[1355-270]J
German divisions were being used, and the Intelligence department at the War Office could not find more than six.General Robertson then read to the Cabinet the orders whichhe had given to General Sir H. Plumer, directing him to take overcommand from Lieutenant-General Lord Cavan. These orders hadreceived the approval of the Prime Minister, and the necessaryextract had been communicated to the Italian Government. He,stated that Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig had been warned tohold two other Divisions in readiness to proceed to Italy at short notice, and he had called for a report from Sir Douglas flaig uponthe effect such withdrawals would have upon his operations.Attention was called to a statement that had appeared in theLondon press to the effect that General Fayolle had been appointedto command both the French and British troops serving in Italy,and the War Cabinet requested the Secretary to arrange for thecontradiction of the report as soon as confirmation of its inaccuracyhad been obtained from Paris.Attention was also called to the statement by the King of Italythat the loss of Venice would involve the retreat of the Italian fleet to ports in Southern Italy. The First Sea Lord stated that thismatter was receiving consideration.Supreme inter-Allied Council and allied GeneralStaff.2. With reference to War Cabinet 263 (Minute 13) and WarCabinet 268 (Minute 7), the War Cabinet discussed a draft reply to aquestion to be put that afternoon in the House of Commons byMr. Joseph King, M.P. There seemed to be considerable doubt asto whether the officers nominated by the three Governments were tobe members of the Council or merely advisers.In this connection the War Cabinet attached importance to theprinciple that the functions of the Inter-Allied Council should not inany way abrogate or over ride the functions of the General Staffs ofeach country, or the paramount authority of the respective Govern-ments with regard to the disposition of their troops, or military policy.TonnageConference.3. Lord Robert Cecil reported that he had requested the Frenchand Italian Governments to send representatives to London at theearliest possible moment, to discuss with ourselves and the americans the tonnage situation as a whole.The War Cabinet decided that The selection of the British representatives, and the Terms ofReference, should be left for decision to Lord Milner,Sir Edward Carson, and Lord Robert Cecil.Palestilie- 4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that he hadreceived no official estimate of the number of Turkish prisonerstaken up to date by General Allenby. He considered general allenby&apos;s operations had been a very fine performance, and it was clear that General Allenby. was making the most of a valuableopportunity. The question of the future operations in that theatrewould reqiure consideration.Attention was called to the fact that the press had beenindulging in somewhat precipitate expressions regarding thepossible capture of Jerusalem, and the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff undertook to issue a caution in this respect.Submarines. e5. The First Sea Lord reported that the Special Service ship&quot; Rule,&quot; escorting a convoy, had rammed an enemy submarine onthe 9th instant about 140 miles from Cape Spartel.    The upper
Bombing raids . 6. The First Sea Lord reported that a successful bombing raidfrom Dunkirk had been carried out during the night of the9-10th November on the St. Denis Westrem Aerodrome, 14 112-lb.bombs being dropped with apparently good results. A largenumber of bombs had also been dropped on Bruges Docks. Goodshooting was made and a large fire caused. All our machinesreturned safely.The Alleged Privy 7. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to a story,Council Meeting circulated in the German press and reproduced in the &quot; Times,&quot;in July, 1913. to      effect that a secret meeting of the Privy Council took place inJuly 1913 at Mr. Asquith&apos;s house, attended by the King andaddressed by Lord Kitchener, Sir Edward Grey, and Mr. Churchill,at which war with Germany was advocated. While the story was obviously absurd, the War Cabinet agreed that it was advisable thata definite contradiction should be issued.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed to get into touch with the principal persons alleged to have been present at this meeting of the Privy Council, and toarrange for the publication, in answer to a parliamentary question or otherwise, of a definite and detailedcontradiction.Threatened Strike 8. The Chief Secretary for Ireland drew the attention of thein Belfast. War Cabinet to the imminence of  a strike on the part of the employees in the electric and gas undertakings of the corporation of Belfast. The dispute had arisen out of the refusal of theCorporation to grant to the outdoor workers the War Bonus which,as the result of an arbitration, they had given to the indoor workers.The outdoor workers had demanded an arbitration, failing whichthey intended to &quot;cease work that night. The Lord Mayor had applied to the Military Authorities to supply him with soldiers, both to carry on the running of the electric and gas supply and toprotect the works against possible sabotage on the part of the strikers. He had only heard of the matter indirectly, and hadconveyed a suggestion to the Lord Mayor that the Corporation oughtto arbitrate, bitt he had not received any reply to this. His opinion,which was shared by Mr. Kellaway, who was present on behalf ofthe Ministry of Munitions, was that the attitude of the corporation had been very difficult. He did not think himself that it was at alldesirable to use soldiers for the purpose suggested. It would be quite a different matter if there were disturbances, and the interven-tion of the Military were requested for the maintenance of order.The Representatives of  the Minister of Munitions and the structure of the submarine was seen as the ship passed over her,and grating was heard and felt. Two depth charges were dropped,one of which exploded, and a further small explosion was beard,followed by the appearance of oil. The submarine was probably sunk, and certainly badly damaged.The First Sea Lord reported a submarine attack on vesselsanchored off Belah (south of Gaza). The British destroyer&quot; Staunch&quot; and monitor &quot; M 15 &quot; had been sunk.The First Sea Lord reported that seaplane 9850 bombed a submarine 2&quot;50 p.m. 11th, S. by E.4/E., 20 miles from the StartLighthouse. First 100 lb. bomb dropped on periscope, which was still above water, and second about 30 feet in front of first. third and fourth were dropped in middle of disturbance. Large disturb-ance under water after last bomb. Submarine considered damaged and possibly sunk.
Minister of Labour concurred in tbe undesirability of employingsoldier labour.The War Cabinet instructed The Chief Secretary for Ireland to send a strongly-wordedtelegram to the Lord Mayor of Belfast, pointing out thatit was the duty of the Corporation, in the present criticalshipping situation, to submit the matter to arbitration andnot to run the risk of a strike which would paralyse the shipbuilding activities of Belfast.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,November 12, 1917.
