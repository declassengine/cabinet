WITH reference to War Cabinet 259, Minute 1, the DirectorItalv- of Military Operations said that, according to the most recent information, the Italian situation appeared to be improving slightly.The retirement of the Italian troops to Tagliamento was proceeding in a more orderly manner, with less interruption from the enemy^asthe latter got further from the railhead.With reference to the statement which appeared in GeneralDelme-Radcliffe&apos;s telegram No. 510 of the 29th instant, to the effectthat the Second Army must have lost the greater part of its artillery,probably not less than 1,500 guns, General Maurice said that hethought it very probable that the losses had been appreciably ^over-estimated.General Maurice then read an extract from telegram No. 505 ofthe 2oth instant from General Dehne-Radcliffe, which showed that[1365 260] B
2. The Director&quot; of Military Operations said that Sir douglas haig wished to send with the British reinforcements two completesquadrons of the Royal Flying Corps from. France (one artillerysquadron and one reconnaissance squadron). In this connection hehad to point out that General Allenby recently reported that inthe Palestine theatre the enemy would very shortly have as manyaeroplanes as ourselves on that front, and he accordingly pressed for the despatch, of two additional Flying Squadrons. As these squadrons,would have to be sent by sea, they could not reachGeneral Allenby for another five Or six weeks.The War Cabinet decided that The British force proceeding to Italy should be accompaniedby two complete Flying Squadrons, and that they should examine later the possibility of meeting General Allenby&apos;s requirements.the present disaster was not due to any revolutionary or mutinoustendencies, but had been brought about by the deliberate and pre-meditated action of the troops in dropping their equipment andabandoning their positions under the instigation of, and due to theinsidious propaganda conducted by, pacifists, socialists, and enemyagents.General Maurice further indicated the place where the french troops, which were being sent to the support of the Italians, wouldbe concentrated under the present arrangements.With regard to . the British reinforcements which werebeing sent from France to Italy, General Maurice stated that the headquarters and advanced party were to leave Paris to-day.General Cavan had been selected to command these reinforcements,and was due in London this afternoon. In the event of it beingdecided considerably to augment the reinforcements now being sent,Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig had suggested, and the Chief of theImperial General Staff had concurred, that the Chief Commandshould be ,a;iven to Sir Henry Rawlinson. The Prince of Wales wasto be attached to General Cavan:s Staff, but would not leave Englanduntil this week.With regard to the movements of the British main body, sir douglas Haig, who had gone into the question very thoroughly withthe French authorities, reported that it would hot be feasible forthem to leave before the (3th November without serious dislocation of the arrangements made for transporting the French reinforce-ments. The French were prepared to hand over to the British thewhole of the Southern routes, by which 24^Chrough trams a &quot;day andS trains to the frontier with a inarch across would be available.Certain French units would proceed by road across the passes, andthe French stated that the whole of our force would be concentratedbefore the last of the French troops reached their destination. Thewhole of our fighting troops should reach their place of con-centration by about the ISth November. General Maurice reminded the War Cabinet that the whole of the French railway system tothe South was under the sole control of the French.The War Cabinet, while regretting that under these arrange-ments substantial French reinforcements would reach the frontierbefore any body of British troops could arrive, authorised The Director of Military Operations to inform Sir Douglas Haigthat the above programme was approved.The Secretary of State for War undertook, in consultation withhis Staff, to examine the possibility of despatching a certainnumber of British troops at an earlier date.General Maurice further informed the War Cabinet that, theBritish units which  were being sent to Italy were taking with themconsiderably more than their usual complement of artillery.
3 W.C. 2603. With reference to&quot; the decision reached on the previous day(War Cabinet 259, Minute 1), that a copy of General Dessino&apos;sletter (Appendix) should be circulated so that it might be consideredbefore any steps were taken for its publication, the War cabinet had before them the text of the letter.The Secretary of State for War said that General Dessino wasvery much disturbed at the delay in publishing the letter, and hisown view was that it was desirable to publish some statement whichshould include General Cadorna&apos;s address to the troops, in itsunexpurgated form. The Italian Ambassador, however, hadpersonally protested to him against publication of General Dessino&apos;sletter and of General Cadorna&apos;s address in its complete form. Onthe other hand, General Dessino had threatened, if his letter werenot published, to communicate it to the Press abroad.The Director of Military Intelligence said that public opinion in Italy and this country was much influenced by the exaggeratedreports of the enormous numbers of German and Austrian troopsbeing launched against the Italian Front. If the Italians reallybelieved that they were being invaded by an army of 100 Divisions,it was highly probable that they would feel themselves compelledto make a separate peace. If, on the contrary, they were told the truth, which was that not more than 5 or G German and 45 AustrianDivisions were opposed to them, they would recover their moral,and the publication of the facts would have an excellent effect in italy, Russia, and in this country. In his opinion it was a mistake to permit the peoples of those countries to imagine that the germans have inexhaustible supplies of troops aud can move them from oneFront to another with inconceivable rapidity.It was pointed out that it was highly undesirable to publishanything which might cause friction between the Russians and theItalians.The War Cabinet were of opinion that, for obvious reasons, itwas not advisable to publish detailed and accurate information inour possession in regard to enemy dispositions and movements.They agreed, however, that, in order to reassure the public generally,some reference should be made, in Parliament or in the Press, tothe gross exaggeration of the numbers of German and Austriantroops on the Italian Front.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) General Dessino&apos;s letter should not be published.(6.) Suitable steps should be taken to represent confidentiallyto the responsible Press of this country the desirabilityof correcting, by other means than an official communique,the existing false impressions which obtained as to thestrength of the enemy concentration in the Italiantheatre.Sir Fdward Carson undertook to take the necessary action.Chinese PioneerBattalions for theWestern Front.4. The Director of Military Operations informed the WarCabinet that General Foch had written to the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff asking for the support of the latter to a proposal to transport and employ Chinese tip to the number of about fortybattalions for pioneer work on the Western Front, the men to bedrawn from the Chinese regular army. General Foch had pointedout that this arrangement, if carried into effect, would not interferewdth the recruiting of Chinese by the British authorities for labourpurposes. It was expected that Chinese and Japanese tonnagewould be used for the transport of these men, and that possiblyenemy ships seized by the Chinese Government in their waterswould also be employed. The Director of Military Operations saidthat he saw no military objection to General Foch&apos;s proposal.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that, in hisopinion, in view of the present serious tonnage situation, the ShippingController should he asked for his views, because it might be thatany ships taken for the purpose of transporting the Chinese wouldbe taken from some other and important trade. *The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Director of Military Operations should send to theSecretary of the War Cabinet a copy of General Foch&apos;sproposals.(b.) The Secretary should refer the matter to the ShippingController for his remarks,(c.) The Secretary should raise the question at the forthcomingInter-Ally Conference.5. With reference to War Cabinet 257, Minute 7, the First sea lord reported that the Liaison Officer at Petrograd had forwardedthe following additional information concerning operations of Britishsubmarines in the Baltic On the 9th and 10th October &quot;El&quot; endeavoured to attackships of Libau harbour, but was prevented by the largenumber of torpedo boats spread across the channel.On the 15th October &quot; E 9 &quot; attacked a convoy of five small ships and two destroyers, but the two torpedoes firedmissed.At 5-30 a.m. on the 16th October &quot; C 27 &quot; sighted main german fleet in the Gulf of Riga in three lines, with transportsand destroyer screen. She attacked first &quot;Dreadnought&quot;with two torpedoes at 300 yards ; torpedoes passed under-neath ; one was heard to explode shortly afterwards, butit is not known what was hit. &quot; C 27 &quot; then fired at lasttransport, hitting her amidships. Fire was opened on&quot; C 27,&quot; and she was attacked wdth depth charges.On the 17th instant &quot;C 27&quot; dived through Irben Straits bydaylight and saw the torpedoed transport with four trawlersalongside.   &quot; C 27 &quot; gave chase, but could not get her.Bombing raids . 6. The First. Sea Lord stated that reports had been receivedfrom Dunkirk as follows : -(a.) Two 250-lb. and eight 65-lb. bombs were dropped on railway junctions south-west of Ghent, on three trains.(b.) Two 250-lb. and eight 65-lb. bombs were dropped onBinges Docks.(c.) One of our machines landed at the Royal Flying Corpsaerodrome, Droglands, and has now returned safely.This machine left with the intention of reaching Cologne,but, having encountered thick weather and heavy rain,was forced to fly at 1,500 feet. At Duren (about 20 miles.S.W. of Cologne), further progress becameimpossible,and a very brightly illuminated factory 3 miles east ofDuren was attacked with twelve 112-lb. bombs, one ofwhich fell through the roof, and the remainder fell withinthe factory enclosure. The flight occupied 7^ hours.The total weight of bombs dropped was 4  tons.British submarines in the Baltic.
2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,October 30, .1917.Food Situation in 7. Tiie Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reminded, the WarFrance and Italy. Cabinet that, if the present military situation in Italy was grave,the question of the position of that country in respect of food wasno less serious. Apart from the general shortage of foodstuffs allover the world, the problem of distributing such foodstuffs as wereavailable to the Allies had to be faced, and that was essentially oneof shipping. The War Cabinet had the previous day considered aMemorandum by himself on the shipping situation (War Cabinet 259,Minute 9), but no decision had been reached. Air. Balfour said that,iii his opinion, it was impossible to exaggerate the gravity of thesituation in regard to the shrinkage of tonnage, and he felt very strongly that the whole question must be tackled without the slightest delay.- The problem, as he viewed it, was threefold : (a.) How to keep France and Italy going through the winter and alter.(b.) How much, shipping could the Allies count on obtainingfrom the United States of America,(c.) How best to take immediate steps to cut down imports andto restrict consumption.He.suggested that a committee should be appointed at once to investigate the whole position, consisting of the President of theBoard of Trade, the Shipping Controller, the Food Controller,Lord Milner, General Smuts, and himself.It was pointed out that the problem of food supplies to Franceand Italy had been examined by the War Cabinet at their meetingon the 25th instant (War Cabinet 257, Alinute 1), when it had beendecided, inter alia, that Sir Albert Stanley, in concert with the FoodController and the Shipping Controller, should report to the WarCabinet on the whole question, after investigating it withM. Clementel and Signor Arlotti. It was further stated that everyday the question was receiving the most anxious and careful con-sideration of the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the Government Departments concerned.Mr. Balfour then read a letter he had received from Sir -albert stanley, stating that Al. Clementel had announced his intention, if nothing was settled bv the end of the current week, of returning toFrance and placing his resignation in the hands of his Government.It was suggested that the measures we were now taking toassist in retrieving the military situation ou the Italian front might eventually be rendered abortive if Italy were compelled to withdrawjroiu the war owing to the inability of her Allies to help her to feedher popuhition.The War Cabinet agreed that the whole question called for anearly and definite decision, but that, as pointed out on the 25thOctober (War Cabinet 257, Minute I), it was impossible to considerthe question piecemeal, as the food situation was only a part of thegeneral shipping situation. A decision in regard to it could only betaken when the general military policy, on which the munitions programme would hinge, was decided.(The discussion was adjourned.)
tDear Sir,THE Austro-Germair offensive on the Eastern part of the Italian front has caused a great deal of comment from the British press, owing to the articles whichcorrespondents in Italy have sent here. The articles differ, hut almost all speak ofBussia&apos;s inactivity as the cause of a large number of troops having been transferred toItaly, and some articles are written ironically at Russia&apos;s expense. For example, thefollowing phrases appear in the papers : &quot; Indeed it might be said that the germans have transferred their Russian front here, &quot; and &quot; Good-bye Russia, &amp;c.&quot; The figures which appear in the papers referring to the transfer of men from the Russian front areenormous. They amount to as many as 300,000 men. I do not know where such information comes from, but actually the following troops have been transferred toItaly :-Two German divisions from France, 4 German divisions (1 doubtful) fromRoumanian and Galicia, and 3 Austrian divisions from Galicia. As seen, these troops have not only come from the Russian, but also from the Roumanian andFrench fronts.   The total number of troops transferred does not exceed 80,000 men.Eighty-six German Infantry and 10 German Cavalry divisions, 33 Austrian Infantry,and 11 Austrian Cavalry divisions, and 7 Infantry and 2 Cavalry xlivisions of^Turksand Bulgarians continue to remain on the Russian front.On the Italian front, including the German and Austrian divisions transferredthere recently, there are altogether f)0 hostile divisions opposed to the whole italian front. I doubt whether such articles in the press are useful in furthering relationsbetween Russia and England, towards which end different Anglo-Russian institutionsare already at work.All this tends to create ill-feeling in Great Britain towards Russia, and when the news reaches Russia wall certainly provoke the Russian nation.All this is exactly what Germany wants, and she is spreading her propaganda withthis intention.During the war, every time divisions have been transferred from the Russian front the British press mentioned the fact, omitting to state that other divisions were trans-ferred to replace them from other fronts.This inter-movement of troops between and along fronts happens constantly, butthe press only seem to pick out the movements which give the impression that additional troops are being transferred to the British front.The opinion that the Russian front is inactive is not correct; local fighting is constantly taking place in Europe as well as in Asia, and the hostile troops are being held on each front.Unfortunately nothing appears in the press about all this. It is not my work to write about this, nor have I the time to do so.I cannot, however, refrain from comparing the foregoing with the fact that when general Brusilof advanced last summer in Galicia and eighteen divisions were trans-ferred from other fronts and from the interior of Germany, the Russian press didj notcomplain or write ironical articles.I should like to point out that my name is not Bessino, as printed in my lastarticle, but Dessino.  .APPENDIX.(Letter   by General Dessino, Russian Military Attache in London, submitted for publication in the press of Great Britain).
