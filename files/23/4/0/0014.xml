THE War Cabinet had a short discussion on the question ofAir Raids, in the course of which it was pointed out that there is atendency on the part of the public to crowd underground railway-stations in anticipation of an Air Raid, even when no warning hasbeen issued. It was suggested that the authorities concerned should make better arrangements for regulating the use of the passages and platforms of the underground railways during a raid. It was further suggested that the Press should be asked to&apos;emphasise the fact that the -noise made by the anti-aircraft defensive[t 365-240] B
artillery was often mistaken for the bursting of bombs, which gave the impression that the number of bombs dropped was far larger than the reality.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff was authorised to thank the Press for the attitude that they had taken uptowards recent attacks, and should invite them to qallattention to the confusion between the bursting of bombs and fire of artillery.The Western Front. 2.  The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that sincethe last battle the Germans had put in nine divisions, which indicated that they were using up their divisions very rapidly.On the previous day four strong counter-attacks had been made bythe enemy between 4 and 7 p.m., the most severe of which wras southof the Polygon Wood. All attacks had been repulsed and theGerman losses had been extremely heavy. . Our troops had retainedall the ground that they had captured.The Prime Minister remarked on the poor condition of theGerman prisoners whom he had seen on the 26th instant, during his recent visit to the British front in Flanders, and upon the very goodspirit which prevailed among all ranks of our own army that he had seen and conversed with. The enemy system of concrete block-houses, commonly known as &quot;pill-boxes,&quot; appeared to have beenmastered by our troops.The Eastern Front. g  The chief q  ^ Imperial General Staff read extracts from atelegram he had received from General Barter, giving GeneralAlexeiefs reasons for declining to take office, among which was hisinsistence that the Commissaries should not be permitted to interfere in any way at the front. General Barter said that the opinion washeld in certain quarters that the Bolsheviks might get into power,in which case there was a possibility of a separate peace. GeneralBarter believed, however, that the Bolshevik Committees outside the petrograd area would be opposed to this. It was further stated thatM. Kerensky&apos;s power was on the wane.The Italian Front:Withdrawal of guns.Their Disposal.4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff read a communication from General Cadorna to the effect that he had given orders for therelease of the British heavy guns which had been lent to him forthe recent offensive. General Robertson said that he had suggested to General Cadorna that these guns might now be released, as theyhad been lent for the offensive ; and, as it appeared that the Italianarmies would now act on the defensive, he assumed they would nolonger be required. General Cadorna, in his reply, had laid stressupon the fact that he alone was in a position to decide whether the offensive or the defensive should be adopted on his front.As regards the disposal of the above guns, the Chief of theImperial General Staff stated that plans had been considered for reinforcing the Italians with heavy artillery next year, and, in viewof our own deficiency in personnel, the alternative had been con-sidered of sending guns to Italy without the personnel. This pro-posal was open to the objection that it would be difficult in such circumstances to secure the return of the guns. It had also beensuggested that the personnel of these batteries might be made uppartly of Italian and partly of British gunners. . No final decision,however, had been reached. General Kobertson said that, shouldthe War Cabinet decide to send guns to Italy without their personnel,it would be necessary now to leave some of the guns recently lentwith the Italians lor instructional purposes, and General Delme-Radcliffe had made a proposal to this effect.
Seaplanes.As regards the proposal to divert British guns withdrawn fromthe Italian front to Palestine, General Robertson expressed himself as doubtful whether they could all be made use of in that theatre.Each battery required two trains for its transportation, and it wasonly possible to run seven or eight trains a day between Egypt andthe Gaza front. On the other hand, the Prime Minister attached great importance to the necessity for giving heavy artillery support to General Allen by, in view of the formidable nature of the Turkishdefences.General Robertson stated that General Allenby had been giveneverything that he had asked for. With a view to a decision,however, he undertook to ascertain from General Allenby how many guns he could make use of.5. The First Sea Lord reported that two of three aircraft flownfrom the &quot; Vindex &quot; to attack the Zeppelins in the recent raid failedto return. A later report stated that one seaplane with two men had been towed to Holland ; the other had probably been lost.Submarines.6 The First Sea Lord reported that the oiler &quot; San Zaferino &quot;was torpedoed 30 miles from the Smalls early that morning. Theenemy submarine appeared on the surface about 1,000 yards away.Our &quot; P 61 &quot; opened fire and obtained a hit. She then&quot; rammedthe enemy at full speed, and the submarine sank stern first; a loudexplosion followed. Two men subsequently came to the surface,one of whom, the commanding officer, was rescued. The oiler hadbeen towed in.Bombing Raids.7. The First Sea Lord reported that bombing raids were madeon the night of the 25th/26th instant at Thourout, Lichtervelde,and Cortemarck Junctions. Several direct hits had been observed in each case.   All machines had returned safelv.The Berne PeaceCongress : Issueof Passports.8. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs referred to sir horace RumbohFs telegram No. 866, dated the 21th September,1917, in which it was stated that among the delegates said to beexpected at a forthcoming International Peace Congress at Bernewere three or more Englishmen, including Mr. Charles Buxton,Mr. J. A. Flobson, and Mr. \V. H. Dickinson, M.P. Mr. Balfourasked for the instructions of the War Cabinet in the event of theBritish representatives applying to the Foreign Office for passports.It was pointed out that it would be hardly consistent to grantpassports to these delegates seeing that they had been refused to labour representatives who had desired to attend the stockholm conference.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was authorised bythe War Cabinet, in the above event, to refuse to issuepassports, on the broad grounds that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment could not countenance unauthorised negotia-tions with the enemy.Electoral Reform.9. Mr. Barnes stated that, at a meeting of the Labour Party,held yesterday, the future of the Electoral Reform Bill was discussed. A suggestion was made at, the meeting that there was aplot on foot to delay the progress of the Bill in the House of Lords.Lord Curzon stated that he knew of no such plot, but it wasimpossible to foretell what attitude the Llouse of Lords mightassume towards the Bill when it reached their Lordships.   Sorno[1365-2401 B 2
might wish to have a referendum on the question of women&apos;s votes;others might wish some guarantees as to the proposed reform of theHouse of Lords.Coal Miners&apos; JO. The War Cabinet resumed  their  consideration   of   theiDemand for negotiations which were proceeding between the Coal Controller and increase of Wages.    the Miners&apos; Federation (War Cabinet 23(f, Minute 14).Sir Albert Stanley reported that the Miners&apos; delegates had decided to adhere to their demand for an advance of 10s. per weekper man. The original demand for an advance of 25 per cent,would have cost from 25,000,000Z. to 30,000,OOOZ. per annum. Theaddition of 10s. would bring the average wage increase during thewar up to about 65 per cent.The Coal Controller stated that the men Avere out of hand, andthe leaders were not leading, but were being pushed forward.There had been evidence of this in connection with recruitingarrangements, to which the leaders had agreed, but which the men had afterwards rejected. The men based their claims for thepresent increase on the fact that the cost of living had risen duringthe war by S3 per cent. They also alleged that 50 per cent, of theminers have to pay for tools and explosives, the cost of which had gone up during the war. In the view of the owners whom he had consulted, any stoppage would last for at least a fortnight. Therewas undoubtedly a fair proportion of loyal men among the miners,but once a strike began it would be difficult to stop the loyal menfrom joining their comrades from a sense of solidarity. Withregard to stocks of coal in the country, the munition works mightcarry on, rather badly, for ten days. There was little space for much storage in the new factories. In recent strikes in the Midlandsgreat pressure had been brought on the Department to secure thereturn of the men to work owing to the shortage of coal.The Minister of Labour said that the aspect of the problem which he wished to emphasise was the effect any concession to theminers would have on? the other industries. The railwaymen were already passing resolutions in favour of an advance of 11. per wee .The engineers have been making demands on the Ministry ofMunitions. Demands for advances would, in fact, be general inOctober, and the cost of meeting these on the scale put forward bythe miners would involve the country in tens of millions of pounds.In fact, it might become a question for consideration whether the cumulative effect of these universal demands might not evenprevent us from carrying on the war.The Cabinet wrere impressed with the gravity of the situationpresented to them by the Board of Trade and the Minister of Labour.On the one hand, to concede the full demand of the miners wouldbe a precedent for other workers who up to the present had beengranted increases on a far less generous scale than the miners.Further, the miners were deliberately ignoring the important and costly efforts which were being made by the Government to reducethe price of commodities to the consumer. On the other hand, theGovernment could not embark on a conflict with the miners unless they were certain to bring it to a victorious issue. This, it was generally agreed, was more than doubtful, as the Government were bound to recognise the insistent demands by the war Departments,to whom even a fortnights interruption of coal supplies would beperilous, and a strike running, as it probably would, to perhaps six weeks, disastrous to the conduct of the war. We, had to bear inmind not only our own need of aeroplanes and ships, which wereabsolutely vital to us, but also the undesirable results which would follow if the supplies of coal to France and Italy were broughtto a standstill. A great strike would therefore be equivalent toa military defeat. Nor would it perhaps be easy &apos;to convince the general public that the Government were justified in permitting
5WG 240a colossal dislocation of the nation&apos;s industries in the midst of war for the sake of a difference of half-a-crown for so it would, hepopularly represented.The War Cabinet, while recognising that the demand by theminers was unreasonable and deeply to be deplored, decided thai-Owing to the exigencies of the war they had no option butto authorise the Coal Controller to negotiate up to amaximum of Is. 8d. per day for men and iOd. per day for boys.&apos;*The War Cabinet requested The President of the Board of Trade to report later on thequestion how far the extra cost of the coal, following onthe present increase of wages, should be charged to industrial and domestic consumers respectively.The question of securing in the agreement with the miners acondition that wages should in future be reduced paripassu with reductions in the cost of living was left open.Anglo-french conference atBoulogne,September 25,1917.11. The Prime Minister drew the attention of the War Cabinetto the short summary of Conclusions reached at the Anglo-french conference at Boulogne on the 25th September, 1917, which hadalready been circulated to the War Cabinet (Appendix). He alsogave the War Cabinet particulars of his private conversations withM. Painleve, the French President of the Council.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,September 27, 1917.* Lord Curzon and Lord Milner asked that their dissent from this conclusion might be recorded.
APPENDIX.(I.C.-27.) --Conclusions of an Anglo-French Conference, held in the train atBoidogne, on September 25, 1917, at 3t6 p.m.The Italian Front. 1. THE   British   and   French   Governments,   while   greatlyregretting the decision of General Cadorna not to pursue the offensive operations, for which 100 French guns were recently sentto the Italian front, are agreed that no action can usefully he takenin order to obtain a reversal of this decision. The whole of theBritish and French heavy artillery will in consequence be withdrawnfrom the Italian front.Extension of theBritish Line onthe Western Front.2. The British Government having accepted in principle theextension of the line held by the British army on the Western front,the two Governments are agreed that the question of the amount ofthe extension and the time at which it should take place should beleft for arrangement between the two Commanders-in-chief.Military Operations 3. General Foch expressed the view that an operation on them Turkey. Turkish littoral, directed against the Turkish communications, canonly succeed in conjunction with a successful advance by theBritish army in Palestine, combined with a successful holdingoperation in Mesopotamia. He undertook to study the question ofsuch an operation designed to exploit any success which might beachieved by the Allied armies in Palestine and Mesopotamia, on theunderstanding that the British Government Avill render substantial assistance in the matter of shipping transport and naval escorts.General Foch undertook to transmit his observations to theBritish Government by Monday next.The Equipment of 4 General Foch laid great stress on the importance to thee ree- rmy. Allies of equipping and preparing the Greek army, which, he pointedout, afforded an opportunity to the Allies for increasing their force at Salonica by three existing and three new divisions without thenecessity of transporting them. In particular, he asked the BritishGovernment to undertake the supply of forty heavy guns.The British Government undertook to consider this request inconjunction with other requests for heavy guns received fromRussia, Roumania, and Italy.Boidogne, September 25, 1917.o
