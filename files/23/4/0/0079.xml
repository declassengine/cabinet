The War Cabinet had before them a report to the WarCabinet by the War Cabinet Labour Committee on the 12^ percent, bonus dilemma (Paper G.T.-3096), and a report of theSpecial Sub-Committee of the Committee appointed by the WarCabinet 304, Minute 2 (Paper G.T.-3097).Mr. Barnes, in presenting these two reports, stated that theWar Cabinet Labour Committee had been engaged upon a seriesof questions arising out of the grant of an increase of 12^ per cent,to skilled time-workers, and more particularly with certain classesof labour that were on the borderline of the industries affectedby the grant. Matters were brought to a head last Friday by the stoppage of work in the Belfast shipyards and in the electricsupply department. Conferences had taken place with repre-sentatives of the employers and employed, and the results of these conferences were outlined in Paper G.T.-3096. This documentpresented four alternatives to the Government for decision, andof these four alternatives he recommended the second, namely, toextend the grant to piece-workers in certain specified trades in
2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.December 24, 1917.the form of a guarantee to piece-workers that 12^ per cent, shallbe added to their guaranteed time rates; this, however, to be minusearnings over such time rate; and to advise the revision of ratesso as to encourage working by systems of payment by results. Mr.Barnes pointed out that the third alternative, namely, a wide *extension of the 12^ per cent, bonus, or an equivalent, to all classes,of labour would involve, a cost to the country of anything from100 to 130 millions per annum, while the fourth alternative,namely, to withdraw the 12^ per cent, increase, would result in serious labour troubles and possibly in a general election.Mr. Churchill stated that the perpetual agitation for further increases in wages was due very largely to the fact that the wage-earners were convinced that enormous profits were being made bothby the employers and by profiteers engaged in trade and exchange.He was convinced that one of the only means of stopping these demands would be for the Government to take the whole of the excess profits instead of only 80 per cent. The only way to face the present situation was for the Government to make a proclamation-ination stating that they meant to deal drastically with thequestion of profits, and to place the whole question of profits and wages upon a broad basis of justice and security, which wouldappeal to both capital and labour alike. Whatever increases were approved by the Cabinet should be announced by the Government,and. not by one Department. It was being generally said that thewar was being kept going by persons who were interested inmaking profits out of the war, and he felt that the very existenceof excess profits being received by individuals was wrong both inprinciple and in morals.Mr. Roberts stated that he adhered to the recommendationmade by Mr. Barnes, and that, although the recommendationprovided no logical halting-place, it would give the government sound position upon which they could take a fight with labourif such a fight were to arise. He added that he had for sometime past advocated the taking by the State of the whole of the excess profits.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that he could not nowpledge himself regarding the terms of his next Budget, but fromhis experience in raising the Excess Profits Tax from 50 to 80per cent, he feared that the proposal to take the whole of the excess profits would meet with tremendous opposition from allclasses of employers, and, speaking for himself, he feared that theadoption of Mr. Churchill&apos;s proposal would destroy all incentive to increased output, and would destroy the initiative in Britishindustry. Any proclamation regarding the taking of the wholeof the excess profits was out of the question at present.The War Cabinet approved the recommendation of Mr.Barnes, as set out above, and requested Mr. Churchill to draft a statement, to be issued on behalf ofthe Government on the 1st January, 1918, for the con-sideration of the War Cabinet.
