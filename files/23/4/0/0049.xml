The Invasion of 1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that he hadItaly, received  a  telegram from General Plumer asking for two more divisions, to be held in readiness only, and one cavalry brigade,which should be sent with the sixth division to go, should the latterbe required. For some days to come the railways would be taking all the troops that could be moved to Italy, and before any furthertroops could be moved he expected to receive a full reports uponthe situation from General Plumer.With regard to the difference of opinion concerning the numberof German divisions that had appeared upon the Italian front in theearly days of the offensive, a telegram had been received fromGeneral Delme-Radcliffe stating that the Italian Commando Supremonow admitted the correctness of the British contention, to the effectthat no more than six German divisions could be identified. Theincorrect statement that twenty-one German divisions had appearedon the Italian front had been received from Rome, and was nowproved to be quite unauthenticated.In this connection it was reported that the Italian ambassador had been endeavouring to secure the publication in this country ofmagnified reports regarding the strength of the Germans. Thereason for this was, no doubt, the pressure that was being put by theItalian colony in London upon their Ambassador to cover theaccusations of preventable failure which were being levelled againstItalians in this country.The Western Front. 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theGermans were still heavily bombarding Passchendaele, and had brought up more artillery. More infantry attacks were expected,and it appeared likely that a determined German effort would- bemade to retake the position.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that a telegram had been received from General Allenby, reporting a further advance in Palestine, amounting to nearly 10 miles. His troops were now within 5,000 yards of the town of Jaffa; Lydda andRamleh were now in British hands. Aeroplanes reported that theTurkish troops were retiring northwards through Jerusalem towardsNablus (the ancient Shechem). These troops probably came from thevicinity of Hebron. The total number of Turkish prisoners definitelycounted since 31st October now exceeds 9,000.Arab Co-operation. 4. With reference to Sir Reginald Wingate&apos;s telegram No. 1212,dated the 15th November, and in view of the great importance of arab co-operation at this moment, the War Cabinet decided ;To authorise the proposed increase in the subsidy advanced tothe Arabs, from 2OO,O00L to 500,000LMesopotamia. 5. In view of the British advance in Palestine, and the possiblereinforcement of the Turks by divisions from Aleppo, the opinion was submitted that it was very desirable that General Maude shouldexhibit the maximum possible activity consistent with safety, so asto harass and threaten the Turks in the Mesopotamian theatre.The War Cabinet decided that The Chief of the Imperial General Staff should send a telegram to General Maude, drawing his attention to the necessity ofbeing as active as possible, in order to assist indirectlyGeneral Allenby&apos;s operations ; it being clearly understoodthat the nature of the operations to be undertaken shouldbe left to the discretion of General Maude.
WC 275The American. 6. The   Chief:   of   the   Imperial   General   Staff  stated  thatMission: General Bliss now informed him that   the Americans hoped to american have  12 divisions in France by May next.   More might be forth-Co-operatioa. coining if shipping were available.The Prime Minister stated that he had seen Colonel House, whowas willing to remain in Europe another week in order to attend the postponed Inter-Allied Conference (War Cabinet 274, Minute13). Colonel House and his chief Heads of Departments desired tocome to a meeting of the War Cabinet at which the ministers concerned should be present on Tuesday morning next. lord reading had seen Colonel House with a view to arranging the specific points that should be brought up for discussion, and was in communication with most of the Departments concerned, with aview to the preparation of the material required by the PrimeMinister for a statement of the British views regarding theco-operation of the United States of America. The Prime Ministerrequested The First Sea Lord and the Chief of the Imperial General staff to furnish him with a statement of the questions whichthey wished him to raise at this important meeting.Salonica. T. Sir Edward Carson asked that the Memorandum by theChief of the Imperial General Staff, dated the 14th November(Paper G.T.-2615), on the position at Salonica should be discussed at an early date.The Prime Minister reported that he gathered thatM. Venizelosshared the general view that little or nothing could be done unlessGeneral Sarrail were removed from the command in that theatre.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that, in hisopinion, we should do all we could to utilise the Greeks.M. Venizelos quite understood that it was impossible for us tosend more troops, but earnestly requested that the provision of gunsand equipment for the Greek Army should be hastened.The Secretary of State for War informed the Cabinet that theFrench were responsible for providing rifles, and that of the 36heavy guns promised b\T us 12 were now ready, and only awaitedshipping to be conveyed to Greece.The Minister of Munitions stated that he hoped to be able to announce shortly a slight increase in the output of heavy guns inthis country, more especially of 6-inch howitzers. it would, ofcourse, he a question for decision as to whether this increased supply should be allotted to Italy or to Greece.Hope was expressed that, in the event of M. Clemenceausucceeding in forming a Government, it might be possible again to approach the French Government with a view, to the removal ofGeneral Sarrail.Submarines. 8. The First Sea Lord reported that information had beenreceived from Penzance to the effect that three motor-launchesdropped depth charges, and an airship dropped a bomb, on thewake of a submarine about 4 miles south of Porthleven on the15th instant. Considerable patches of oil appeared, and the sub-marine was hunted by the motor-launches for four hours, the wakebeing sighted two or three times.Bombing Raids. 9. The First Sea Lord stated that Dunkirk reports that, in thecourse of patrols on the .15th instaut, two enemy machines were destroyed and two driven down completely out of control. Two anda half tons of bombs had been dropped on the sheds north of
Handzaeme. All our machines returned safely, but one crashedowing to a forced landing ; the pilot and passenger were uninjured.Eussia. 10. With reference to AVar Cabinet 274, Minute 5, the first sea Lord reported that he had received an answer to his message tothe Senior Naval Officer, Archangel, to the effect that telegraphiccommunication between Archangel and both Petrograd and Moscowhad been interrupted for three days. The latest news from Petrogradreceived at Archangel was dated 12th November, and this was to theeffect that anarchy prevailed in Petrograd, there being a general strike of all Government employes. Severe fighting was taking placein Moscow.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read several telegramsreceived this morning from Russia, the latest of which was dated11th November, and a telegram from Sir C. Marling at Tehran,giving news received from Odessa under date 14th November.The latter was to the effect that in Odessa the Maximalists had theupper hand, the town being overawed by the Fleet, who were in thehands of the Bolsheviks ; civil war was raging in Kieff, and agrariandisorders were general in South Russia. The latest telegram fromthe Military Attache at Petrograd, dated the 10th instant, reportedthat M. Kerensky was endeavouring himself to command three weakdivisions of Cossacks in the vicinity of Tsarskoe Selo, which place hadbeen reoccupied by the Bolsheviks. The behaviour of M. Kerenskyappeared to be lamentable, and to give little hope of any success onhis part.   Food was very scarce in the capital, and famine threatened.11. The War Cabinet had under consideration certaincorrespondence and memoranda relating to the Air Force Bill andsundry amendments which the Army Council desired should beintroduced into the Bill before it became law (Paper G.T.-2621)(Appendix). It was pointed out that &apos;.an immediate decision was required, as the Bill was to pass through the final stages in theblouse of Commons at 12 noon the same day.The particular points upon which a decision was requiredwere : (a.) Whether or not provision should be made in the Bill forthe Air Council to place air forces serving with thearmy under military law.(b.) Whether or not provision should be made in the Bill forthe&apos; creation of new units in the Air Force for thepurpose of anti-aircraft defence by guns.The War Cabinet, having regard to the fact that the Papersbefore them had been received too late to be read before themeeting, and, further, that questions of law as well as of policy were involved, decided that No amendments in regard to the above points should beinserted in the Bill during its passage through the Houseof Commons.The Secretary was instructed to inform the member in chargeof the Bill accordingly.The War Cabinet agreed that amendments in respect of any points raised in the papers before them should be dealt with whenthe Bill came before the House of Lords, and requested Sir Edward Carson in the meantime to study the contents ofthe papers, and to favour them at the earliest opportunityAir Force Bill:Amendments.
with his opinion on the points raised, and as to thedesirability or otherwise of amenuing the Bill so as tomeet the views of the Army Council.Air Council:Exclusion ofBusiness Men.12. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, speaking as the leader of the House of Commons, said that certain Members of parliament were anxious to have inserted in the Bill a clause excluding any individual who might have any financial interest in aircraft factories,or any business connected therewith, from sitting on the new air council.It was pointed out that the new Council would require the bestbrains and experience available, and that such exclusion would deprive the State of the service of men of great experience and business capacity when such would be invaluable.The Minister of Munitions informed the Cabinet that, if such restrictions were placed on himself and his predecessors, his Depart-ment wrould have to forgo the services of many men of knownintegrity who were indispensable and irreplacable. In this connec-tion Mr. Churchill stated that a condition of employment in his department was that any men who had business interests of any kind should disclose them fully to the Secretary to the Ministry.The War Cabinet agreed that A clause in the above sense was unreasonable, and authorised the Leader of the House to oppose any amendmentexcluding; business men from a seat on the Air Council.The Fifth 13, The War Cabinet discussed the advisability of asking theCanadian new Canadian Minister of Oversea Forces, Sir E. Kemp, to attend the War Cabinet soon after his arrival here, in order to considerthe possibility of the Fifth Canadian Division being sent on active service. * This matter had been raised at the Imperial War Cabinet,but the Canadian General had not then seen his way to sending the division ahead, in view of the shortage of recruiting to supplydrafts. The introduction of compulsory service had modified thesituation.The Secretary undertook to confer further with the PrimeMinister on the subject.relations  betweenthe Army Counciland BritishMilitaryRepresentativewith the supreme war Council.14. With reference to War Cabinet J&quot;272, Minute 3, and WarCabinet 273, Minute 21, the War Cabinet briefly considered their reply to the Army Council, and had before them alternative draftsby Sir Edward Carson.The discussion was postponed until that evening.Purchase of 15. The&apos;War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMerchant Ships at Shipping Controller on the purchase of merchant ships at home and home and Abroad.    abroad (Paper G.T.-2606KThe War Cabinet decided To extend the authority already given to the ShippingController to exploit all possible sources of merchanttonnage for delivery up to the end of 1918 (War Cabinet 8,Minute 2 ; War Cabinet, 40, Minute 17 ; War Cabinet 85,Minute 9) so as to include vessels due for delivery in 1919.[1365 275]C
Railway Labour 16. With reference to War Cabinet 226, Minute 10, Sir AlbertUnrest. Stanley stated that the result of the appeal of the Associated society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen to the Committee on production for an increased wage would be shortly announced,and that the National Union of Railwaymen had recently submittedto the Railway Executive Committee a demand for a further increased war wage of 10s. per week. Sir Albert Stanley recommendedthat the Railway Executive Committee be authorised to negotiate with the National Union of Railwaymen with a view to coming to asettlement. He said that he hoped that they would be able to settlewith the National Union of Railwaymen by agreeing to a further increase of 5s. per week. It is unlikely that the Committee on production would concede more than this to the Associated society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen. The total cost will be between 8,000,000i. and 9,OO0,O00Z. Sir Albert Stanley promised to circulate a memorandum showing the financial position under theagreement with the railway companies.The War Cabinet decided to authorise The Railway Executive to settle with the National Union of railwaymen on the basis of an increase of 5*. per week.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,November 16, 1917.
APPENDIX.G.T.-2621. . -The Air Force Bill Suggested Amendments.I. Copies of letters from Secretary, War Office, to Secretary, War Cabinet.II. Memorandum from tbe Air Organisation Committee relating to tbe AirForce Hill.III. Memorandum by tbe War Office.Il/Bills/1494 (C.2).Sir, November 9, 1917.1. IN reply to your letter of tbe Sth instant relating to tbe draft Air Force Bill,I am commanded by the Army Council to acquaint you, for the information of thechairman of the Air Organisation Committee, that they note that provision will bemade in the Bill in accordance with sub:paragraphs (I) and (2) of their letter of the6th instant, number as above.2. With regard to paragraph 3 of your letter under reply, the Council in thetime at their disposal have not been able to fully consider whether the suggestedprovision empowering the military Commander-in-chief in a theatre of war to conveneand confirm general courts martial will meet the case from their point of view, andthey therefore reserve to themselves the right to press for an amendment to the Billduring its passage through the House should this be found necessary to secure theobject which they have in view.3. With regard to paragraph 4, the Council do not desire to press for the retentionof their powers under section 115 of the Army Act to requisition aircraft.4. With regard to paragraph 5, the Council note that under clause 3 (.1.) (a) of theBill it is not possible and is not intended to transfer existing units (or individualsbelonging thereto) engaged in defence against aircraft to the air force without their consent. The Council, however, desire to reaffirm their opinion that anti-aircraft defence by guns mounted on the land or in ships is a branch of Army or Navygunnery, and should remain part and parcel of land or sea artillery, and they wish it tobe made clear that there is no intention to make provision in the Bill for the creationof new units of the Air Force for such purposes.5. Paragraphs 6 and 7 of your letter are noted.6. With regard to paragraph 8, the Council note that property rights and liabilities are dealt with in clause 8 (4) of the Bill, but what they had chiefly in mindin sub-paragraph (2) of their previous letter was the transfer of important buildingcontracts and works (the construction of aerodromes, &amp;c.) now in course of execution,which stand in the name of the Army Council, and which it may be foimd advisable to transfer to the new Air Council.7. Paragraphs 9 and 10 of your letter are noted.I am, &amp;c.(Signed) R. H. BRADE.The Secretary,Offices of the War Cabinet.Air Organisation Committee : Continuation of Correspondence with the War Officeconcerning the Air. Force Bill.5/Bills/1494 (C. 2).Sir, November 14, 1917.IN continuation of War Office letter of the above number, dated the 9th instant,relating to the draft Air Force Bill, 1 am commanded by the Army Council to acquaintyou, for the information of the Chairman of the Air Organisation Committee, thatthey have further considered the provision in the Bill empowering the military commander-in-Chief in a theatre of war to convene and confirm general courts-martial for the trial of persons subject to Air Force Law, and they are not satisfied[1S65 275 j D
that this provision would operate satisfactorily. The effect of the Bill as it stands atpresent is that, in the case of a body of the Air Force acting with a body of the Army,the members of each remain under their respective systems of law. The Counciladhere to their opinion that there should be mutual powers in the Army and* AirCouncils to place their forces under Air Force and Military Law respectively by some provision analogous to the Naval Forces (Service on Shore) Act, under which, e.g., theRoyal Naval Division is at present serving in France. The Council understand thatthis point has been conceded in the case of the Navy, and that Air Force on a shipwill be subject to naval discipline. They desire therefore to press for an amendment to be made to the Bill during its passage through the House to meet their views, andthey would be glad if steps could be taken to introduce a Government amendment toprovide for this point.I am, &amp;c.(Signed) R. H. BRADE.The Secretary,Office of the War Cabinet,Whitehall Gardens, S.W. (1.).IT.The Air Organisation Committee on the 15th November considered the letter ofthe Army Council, dated the 1-lth November, in which the Council proposed that provision should be made in the Air Force Bill for the Air Council to place Air Forcesserving with the Army under Military Law.The Committee considered that it would be undesirable to place- contingents ofthe Air Force allotted to the Army in a theatre of war under Military Law for thefollowing reasons : (1.) The Air Force Act has been specially varied from the- Army Act for thepurpose of enabling the Air Force authorities to maintain disciplineeffectively under the special conditions of air work. To this end certainnew clauses have been added to the Act, constituting new offences whichare peculiar to the Air Force, and there is no provision under Military Lawfor dealing with such offences.(2.) Air warfare differs materially from land warfare, and there may be circum-stances connected with a charge against an air officer or man which wouldmake it undesirable that he should be tried except before a court composedof Air Force officers with experience of air conditions. Military officers who have not served in the Royal Flying Corps would be unable even tounderstand the technical matters which in such a case might very wellarise.(3.) The Committee, considering the general similarity of the Air Act and theArmy Act, have not been able to understand exactly what advantage theArmy Council expect from this proposal, no specific reasons having beenput before them.The two comparisons made in the letter of the Army Council do not appear to theCommittee to have any real bearing on the case. The Naval Division which has beenplaced under Military Law has never been really a naval force, but has actually beenseparated almost entirely from Admiralty administration. This division has - alwaysbeen used as a formation for Military purposes, and there appears to be no reason,except a sentimental one, for continuing to call it a Naval Division. And although this.division has been placed under military Law&quot;, other naval forces serving with theArmy in &quot;the field have not been so placed. The Conditions under which a contingent of the Air Force wiU be attached to an Army in the field are in no way analogous tothose of the Naval Division. The other comparison drawn in the letter is to units ofthe Air Force serving in a ship of war at sea. The Committee regard the conditionsof service in a ship of war as entirely different from those of service with a land force.The enforcement, of a special code of discipline on board His Majesty&apos;s ships hasalways been considered a necessity, and there are certain offences which, althoughtrivial on shore, are considered as very grave in a ship. This view is recognised inthe provision of a Regulation that officers and men of the Army, when serving onboard one of His Majesty&apos;s ships, become subject to the Naval Discipline Act, without
any reciprocal measure by which officers and men of the Navy, when serving with theArmy, are automatically rendered subject to Military Law.The Committee have also had under consideration the letter of the Army Council,dated the 9th November, in which &quot; the Council desire to reaffirm their opinion thatanti-aircraft defence by guns mounted on the land or in ships is a branch of Armyor Navy gunnery, and should remain part and parcel of land Or sea artillery, and they wish it to be made clear that there is no intention to make provision in the Bill for thecreation of new units of the Air Force for such purpose.&quot;In the Bill the Air Council is not limited as to the exact nature of the forces whichmay be raised under the general term of the Air Force. It would seem undesirable tomake special provision in the Bill to forbid the Air Council to raise anti-aircraft units, and a provision of this kind might hamper future decisions of the War Cabinet.The Director of Military Aeronautics and Mr. Corcoran, the other representative ofthe War Office on the Committee, do not assent to these views of the Committee.III.1. The present position is that the whole Army, including the Royal Flying Corps,is subject to Military Law, and the view of the Army Council is that it would be inadvisable to disturb in the middle of the war a system whose working is familiarto all.2. If the new Air Force, whilst serving, for instance, in France, is subjected to military Law, no extra burden is imposed on any single person. So far as the army is concerned, its relation to the Air Force in matters of discipline will remain precisely what at present is the relation of other arms to the Royal Flying Corps. So far as theAir Force is concerned, it will in any case have to familiarise itself with Air Force Law;it is already familiar with Military Law. On the other hand, if the Air Force is subjectto Air Force Law only, every military authority ought to familiarise himself with AirForce Law. It is no sufficient answer to this to say that Air Force Law closelyresembles Military Law. The point is that a military officer convening or confirmingan Air Force court-martial under Section 122 (6), a military officer lent to sit on an air Force court-martial under Section 48 (10), any officer or non-commissioned officergiving an order to an airman under Section 184 a, and any military policeman called in to arrest an airman, ought to know in what respects Air Force Law differs from military Law.3. It has been objected that the Air Force Bill creates certain offences which arenot known to Military Law, and that if the Air Force were placed under Military Lawthis valuable part of the Bill would be in practice sacrificed. This, however, need notbe so. At present, when Air Force personnel are subject to the Naval Discipline Act,Section 179 (c) of the Air Force Act provides that they may be tried and punishedunder that Act for an offence for which they are not amenable to a naval court-martial,but for which they can be punished under the Air Force Act. A similar proviso could,and certainly should, be inserted in the proposed section subjecting the Force to military Law.4. It has further been objected that it would be undesirable for Air force personnel to&apos;be tried normally by military officers. This is recognised ; but it is not considered that this would be the effect of placing the Air Force under Military Law.Air Force personnel would normally be tried by Air Force officers, just as the personnel of the Royal Naval Division is at present normally tried by officers of theRoyal Naval Division, or Australian soldiers by Australian officers. In fact, however,at present it is not usual for members of the Royal Flying Corps to be tried by RoyalFlying Corps officers, on account of the exacting nature of these officers&apos; other duties ;and power has even been expressly taken in Section 48 (10) of the Air Force Bill toperpetuate this system. From the military point of view, there is no desire or intentionto impose military officers on airmen&apos;s court-martial.5. The joint order under Section 184 a, Army Act, and Section 90 a, N.D. Act, hasnot been found sufficient as between the Army and Navy ; and where these two forces are conducting continuous joint operations, the powers of the Naval Discipline (service on Shore) Act have been found necessary. The Army and Air Force will be in close and continuous co-operation every day of the war, and there is no reason to believethat a scheme which was found inadequate as between the Army and Navy will be adequate as between the Army and Air Force.
6. So far as can be seen, the Air Force sacrifices nothing of its individuality as a service by being subjected at times to Military Law, provided the proviso suggested inparagraph 3 above is adopted. In effect the force would remain completely subject to air Force Law, because Air Force Law is Military Law plus a new element, and this new element would be preserved by the proviso. On the other hand, the advantageaofsubjecting them to Military Law plus the new element in Air Force Law, instead of to air Force Law as a whole as such, lies in the simplification for all concerned of theadministration of discipline, and in the avoidance of doubts and uncertainties in the minds of all who have to administer it.7. The Air Organisation Committee, in their letter of the 8th November, haveexpressed their intention &quot; that there shall be that unity of command over military andair forces serving in the same theatre of war, which will obviously be desirable.&quot;The difference, therefore, is one of means, not of end. The Army Council have examined the means proposed by the Committee, and they do not regard them as adequate. In any case, it must surely be admitted that they are complicated ; andeven i i the Council could agree with the Committee as to their adequacy, they would still be of opinion that it is inadvisable in the present emergency to disturb the existing system, which works well, and whose working is known to all who have to administerit, and substitute for it a system whose exact working it is difficidt to foresee in everydetail.War Office, November 16, 1917.
