Thomas Jones, Assistant Secretary.Situation in Russia: 1.   ATTENTION was   called   to   telegram   No.   1112   fromAllied Conference. Sir George Buchanan. In this connection it was pointed out thatthe suggested Allied Conference was to be debarred from con-sidering War Aims, and was merely to discuss the political andmilitary situations. Owing to the uncertainty at present prevailing in Russia it was thought to be undesirable that any definite commu-nicatiou should be made in writing, especially one which might beconstrued by one or other party in Russia as interference in Russia&apos;internal affairs.German Peace 2.  The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that he wasMoves. considerably puzzled by German inaction on the Eastern front, and could not help thinking that Germany was in a worse way than we thought. All the items of information received by him pointed inthis direction, and there were constant, though vague, aUusionsto peace. The Germans appeared to be relying on their U-boats and nothing else. So long as anarchy prevails in Russia a separate peace was not possible, but it was quite clear that the Russiansoldier does not want to fight any more.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that ho had no definite information regarding any intended reply from Germany tothe Pope&apos;s Peace Proposals, but a number of ballons d&apos;essai werebeing sent up in the German press, which looked as if peace proposals might ensue later.
Roumania.3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that he was apprehensive regarding Roumania&apos;s position now that the militaryfailure of Russia seemed inevitable.4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that great difficulties had arisen in regard to the training and transport of american troops. A number of instructors had been ordered toreturn from France for the purpose of going to America, but intima-tion had now been received from Washington that they were no longerwanted. He was in corresiDondence with General Pershing regardingthe transport of the troops, and it appeared that nobody on this side of the Atlantic had any authority to decide anything, wdiilegreat delay was being experienced in obtaining decisions from washington.The First Sea Lord confirmed this view, and stated that he wasexperiencing similar difficulties in all naval matters. He had offered the &quot; Aquitania&quot; for the transport of American troops more than amonth ago, but had received no answer whatever. The proposedTransport Conference was making no headway, and Admiral Mayo&apos;attitude was mainly one of apology owing to his not having thepower to make any decisions.In this connection attention was drawn to the treatment accorded to Sir S. H. Lever in America, and to the great difficulty of having,as it were, three Ambassadors, viz., Lord Northcliffe, Lord Reading,and Sir C. Spring-Rice, in America at the same time.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff and the First sea lord should furnish the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs with material points for a private and personal telegram to be sent by him to Colonel House ;(b.) The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should considerthe desirability of recalling Sir C. Spring-Rice on leave and extending the duration of Lord Reading&apos;s stay inAmerica.The War Cabinet were invited to indicate the part to be played by the Inter-Allied Council. Lord Curzon informed the WarCabinet that his Committee had met on several occasions, andM. Clementel had attended as the French representative. Thesuggestion had been that the Council should be called withrepresentatives of the different Allies, under the Chairmanship of aFrenchman, the general idea being that the Council would meetseldom after its first meeting, and that the current work would be delegated to Sub-Committees. A scheme, drawn up by Mr. 0. J.Phillips, acting on behalf of Lord Northcliffe, had been submitted byLord Robert Cecil. This scheme had been since withdrawn forclerical amendment, but it was clear that this aspect should beconsidered.   The War Cabinet decided that Lord Curzon should be asked to summon his Committee on theInter-Allied Council scheme, with a view to a settlement of outstanding questions of machinery connected therewith.Relations with america.The Greek Army. 5. The   Chief  of  the Imperial General Staff reported thatM. Venezelos&apos;s hopes, expressed early in July last, viz., that tenGreek   divisions   would   be   available   by  October,  were   notmaterialising.   Three, or at the most five, divisions were probablyall that could now be hoped for, and little had been done to get
Fires in Eussian 6. The. Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that aMunition Works. telegram (No. 1350, dated the 14th September, 1917) had beenreceived from the British Military Attache at Petrograd, addressedto the Director of Military Intelligence, stating that a considerable quantity of ammunition had been destroyed at Kazan. enquiry was being made into the cau.se of the fire, and, although definite evidence that these explosions had been caused by German agentshad not yet been obtained, the authorities were satisfied that suchAvas the case. The reported fire at the Putiloff works at Petrogradturned out to be a very small affair, some workmen&apos;s cottages havingbeen destroyed, but the factory and stores remained uninjured.Aden. 7. The views of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff were invited as to the possibility of clearing up the situation at Lahejin the near future, and whether it would be desirable to employChinese troops at all, and, if so, Avhether they could be used forthis purpose (vide telegram No. 971 from Sir Reginald Wingate).The Chief of the Imperial General Staff replied that, owingto the uncertainty of the position in Mesopotamia, he did not recommend the employment of additional British or Indianreinforcements in the Aden theatre at the present time, though sucha possibility might arise later. He was desirous of Chinese troopsbeing got ready,for use in one or other theatre, and, though hequite understood the undesirability of employing such troops inEgypt, he thought that their employment at Aden might eventuallybecome practicable. He undertook to furnish the Cabinet with amemorandum upon the Aden situation.Mesopotamia. 8. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that he feared that negotiations regarding Russian co-operation in Mesopotamiawould haA-e to be commenced all over again with the new Coin-mander-in-Chief, but he was trying to get hold of General Baratoff,who Avas the Russian commander nearest to General Maude. Wewere supplying General Baratoff Avith many of his needs, and he hoped that some assistance might be forthcoming. He Avas holding conference with the shipping authorities regarding preparations for reinforcements being sent to Mesopotamia in case they were needed, and was closely watchiug the position.Question of Publi- 9. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff drew attentioncation of to    an    article    that    had    appeared    in    the    &apos;&quot;&apos; Times&quot;    ofDespatches. Saturday, the 15th September, 1917, in Avhich demands had beenput forward for the publication of further military despatches. he pointed out that w*e Avere the only country that published despatches,and that these Avere a survival of pre-telegraph days. The only-despatch which had been receiA^ed from a Commander-in-chief of an expeditionary Force, and which had not yet been published, AArasthat from Sir Archibald Murray on relinquishing the command inEgypt. HeAvas strongly opposed to the publication of this despatchuntil General Allenby&apos;s operations had made further progress.There had been no despatch from East Africa since General smuts had relinquished command. With regard to a despatch from theWestern Front, he read a telegram from Sir Douglas Haig (No. 621,dated the 16th September, 1917) pointing out the great difficulty ofsubmitting despatches in addition to the very full communiquesalready given to the press.   Any despatch Avhich wordd not giveeven this reduced number ready. Two Greek divisions had been withdrawn from Macedonia and sent to Southern Greece.
useful information to the enemy could be little more than a rechauffeof the information already given.The War Cabinet supported the view put forward by the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff, and considered that Sir Douglas Haigshould not be asked for a further despatch while the presentoperations lasted.*Submarines. 10. The First Sea Lord reported that (a.) On the 10th instant H.M.S. &quot;Viola&quot; dropped&quot; two depth charges on an enemy submarine ; the second charge was followed by a large explosion, and the usual signswere exhibited showing that the submarine was probably destroyed.(b.) H.M.S. &quot;Orwell&quot; dropped depth charges on an enemy submarine near the Shetlands ; it is possible that thesubmarine was sunk.Submarine &quot; G 9 &quot; 11. The First Sea Lord reported that the destroyer &quot;Pasley&quot;Rammed. h.a(j rammed one of our   own submarines, viz., the &quot;G 9,&quot; inmistake for an enemy submarine ; there was only one survivor.Air Offensive. 12. The First Sea Lord reported that on the 13th instant eightseaplanes bombarded munition factories and sheds near SmyrnaRailway Station, inflicting considerable damage.   He added that. probably Smyrna is being used as a submarine base.13. One of our air patrols had engaged a formation of enemy aircraft near Ostend at 10 a.m. on Sunday, the 16th instant, andsucceeded in driving down one enemy aeroplane.14. Seaplanes from Dover carried out an attack upon a flotillaof German trawlers, which was accompanied by a destroyer,between Ostend and Blankenburg. The destroyer was hit amid-ships, and at least one of the trawlers was sunk.The Submarine 15. The First Sea Lord gave a satisfactory report, that sinceSituation. the 1st July twelve enemy submarines had been sunk and twointerned. These figures represented certainties. In this connection the First Sea Lord undertook to furnish the Cabinet with somerecords recently compiled as to the destruction of enemy submarines,showing the percentage sunk to date.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,September 17, 1917-o
