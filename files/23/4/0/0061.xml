Recruitment and organisation of-Women Enrolledfor Work ofNational Import-ance.1. SIR AUCKLAND GEDDES drew the attention of the WarCabinet to his Memorandum (Paper G.T.-25S3), dated the12th November, 1917, regarding the want of co-ordination which existed in regard to the recruitment and organisation of womenenrolled for work of national importance, and of the lack ofuniformity in rates of pay and other conditions which are offered to such women. He suggested that the Ministry of NationalService should be empowered by the Cabinet to include inits functions the recruitment and organisation, of women forall such corps and organisations as the Women&apos;s Army AuxiliaryCorps, the Women&apos;s&apos; Royal Naval Service, the Voluntary AidDetachments, the Women&apos;s Volunteer Reserve, the Women&apos;sEmergency Corps, the Women&apos;s Reserve Ambulance, the WomensOrganisation in the Air Force, the Army and Navy Canteen Board,the Womens Legion, and the Munitions Canteen. He pointed outthat at present all these organisations were competing, and that itwas essential that some sort of priority should be established.The Adjutant-General agreed with the proposal made by theMinister of National Service, and added that, from his experience,he thought that the wage question was a most difficult one, andwould require co-ordination as well as the functions of recruitment and organisation.The War Cabinet decided that The Minister of National Service should be responsible for controlling the recruiting of all women for work of national importance, and that the co-ordination required in con-nection with wages to be paid to such women should bereferred to the Co-ordinating Committee established by war Cabinet 286, Minute 10.War MunitionVolunteer scheme in its Applicationto AdmiraltyEstablishments.2. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to aMemorandum by Sir Lynden Macassey (Paper G.T.-2627) regardingthe position of War Munition Volunteers in Admiralty establish-ments.Sir Auckland Geddes urged the importance of maintaining the .principle that there should be only one Government department responsible for labour supply. He had accordingly communicated with the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister of Munitions,with a view to arranging a modus vivendi in regard to WarMunition Volunteers. He had no desire to take over in detail thewhole administration of War Munition Volunteers, but it was essential that he should be in a position to know where labour wasbeing used to its fullest degree of effectiveness, where there waswastage, and where there were possibilities of dilution or transfer.Pie read to the Cabinet a Joint Memorandum drawn up byMr. Churchill and himself, giving effect to these principles (paper g.T.- 2804) (Appendix). ,Sir Lynden Macassey objected to the proposals contained inthis Joint Memorandum by the Minister of Munitions and theMinister of National Service, on the ground that it really left thecontrol of all War Munition Volunteers, including those engaged on admiralty work, in the hands of the Ministry of Munitions, whichwas a Department competing for labour with the Admiralty. he desired that the Admiralty and the Ministry of Munitions should beplaced upon a footing of equality, and that the Minister of NationalService should control all the War Munition Volunteers. He was apprehensive lest an agreement between the Minister of munitions and the Minister of National Service would be interpreted inpractice to the detriment of the Admiralty.Sir Alan Anderson explained that, so far as shipbuilding was concerned, his Department were newcomers into the field asregards labour requirements, the great mass of available labourbeing already at the disposal of other Government Departments..
Question of Em-ployruent ofSoldiers for CertainCivilian Labour,including TransportBattalions.3. The War Cabinet had before them two Memoranda bv theMinister of National Service (Paper G.T.-2307 and Paper G.T.-2444),and Memoranda by Sir Norman Hill (Paper G.T.-2507), by theMinister of Munitions (Paper G.T.-2625), and by the Admiralty(Paper G.T.-2637).Sir Auckland Geddes stated that at the present time there were a large number of men technically in the Army, and wearinguniform, who were of no military value, and were not part of theHome Defence Force or of draft-finding units. He thought that itshould be a recognised principle that men should henceforth only betaken for the Army for strictly military work. Recruiting for theArmy was being prejudiced by the freedom with which military labour was being used for civil and industrial purposes, such as agriculture and dock work. He did not suggest any immediatedisbahdment  of the Agricultural  Companies or the TransportWorkers&apos; Battalions, but he suggested thatrecruitingfor such[1365-should cease, and that a gradual disbandment should take place.Lord Derby agreed with Sir Auckland Geddes that nothing was more detrimental to the Army than the keeping on the books of theArmy of men of no military value. The present system could bebut thinly-disguised industrial compulsion. It made the Armyunpopular in certain quarters, and it was conducive to industrial unrest, as well as opposed to the spirit of all the pledges given by-287] B 2He looked to the Minister of. National Service to provide his urgent rquirements for shipbuilding.Mr. Kellaway stated that the Ministry of Munitions were quite prepared to submit to equality of treatment with the Admiralty.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Admiralty were to have sole power of assignment of,and control over, War Munition Volunteers in Admiraltyfirms, and the Ministry of Munitions the same power overWar Munition Volunteers in firms other than Admiraltyfirms.In cases where War Munition Volunteers are engaged on work for the Ministry of Munitions inAdmiralty firms, the Admiralty will not transfer such men from that work without the consent of the Ministryof Munitions ; and in the same way, where War MunitionYolunteers are engaged upon work for the Admiralty infirms other than Admiralty firms, the Ministry ofMunitions will not transfer such men from that work without the consent of the Admiralty.(o.) Notwithstanding the provisions of any agreement to thecontrary, the Minister of National Service shall have thepower of ordering the transfer of any War MunitionVolunteer from any firm or any work to any other firmor any other work, through the machinery of theNational Labour Priority Committee.(c.) For the purpose of securing the necessary supervision andcontrol, a small expert staff drawn from the existingstaffs of the Admiralty and the Ministry of Munitionswill be attached to the Ministry of National Service ;and duplicates of all dilution reports will be supplied tothe Ministry of National Service.(cZ.) The Minister of National Service should be asked tosubmit a draft embodying the above decisions, in replyto a joint letter from the Shipbuilding Employers&apos;Federation and Shipyard Trades Union Standing Com-mittee and Boilermakers&apos; Society, dated the 14thNovember, 1917, and addressed to the Prime Minister(Paper G.T.-2697).
Ministers in the past. However, he recognised the great importanceof maintaining agricultural work, and&apos; he feared that if the men nowin the Agricultural Companies were set free they would leaveagriculture and enter munition works, where wages were so much higher and conditions so much easier.Sir Norman Hill stated that, as far as the Transport, Workers&apos;Battalions were concerned, he thought that the fears and anxietiesexpressed by Sir Auckland Geddes and Lord Derby were somewhatexaggerated. As far as such battalions were concerned, he did notthink it was true to say that they had no military value ; 70 per cent,of the men had gone through their &quot;full training as soldiers beforetransfer to the Transport Workers&apos; Battalions. A proportion of themen were engaged upon transport work, while a further proportionwere engaged in training as Infantry. If there were a larger numberof men in the Transport Workers&apos; Battalions, a greater proportioncould be retained at headquarters and thus their efficiency as soldierscould be fully maintained. They could then do a month in training and a month on transport work alternately. They were engaged on very heavy work, such as the handling of iron ore cargoes, andwhenever they worked in a port they were paid the full civilianrate of pay, and out of this they paid for their own billets, so that -there was no question of unfair competition between military and civilian labour as far as these battalions were concerned. In his experience there had been no trouble with these battalions from an industrial point of view, and the Inspecting Officers had reportedfavourably upon their military usefulness.Sir Alan Anderson stated that it was very difficult to draw aline between the kind of work upon which military labour could beemployed and that upon which it could not be properly employed.He instanced the fact that the construction of aerodromes, both inthis country and in France, was considered suitable for military labour. If this was suitable, he thought that the construction ofnew slips in shipyards, especially those upon which german prisoners of war were being employed, was equally suitable. these new yards were in remote places, most of them distant from industrial centres wdiere labour troubles might ensue.Mr. Kellaway stated that officials in the Ministry of Munitionswere most apprehensive regarding the delivery of steel if anythingwere done to interfere with the Transport Workers&apos; Battalions.It was urged that it was most desirable that soldiers retained in this country for purposes of home defence should be employedpart of their time on work of urgent national importance. Sir NevilMacready said that this was a point upon which Field-MarshalLord French would have to be consulted. He very much feared that, if men of the Home Defence Force were scattered all over thecountry upon civil work, their mobilisation in case of a raid tiponthe East Coast would take so long as to render them useless from lord French&apos;s point of view.The War Cabinet requested The Secretary of State for War to considt wdth Field-MarshalLord French and the Minister of National Service, with aview to producing a scheme for the employment on civilian work of men in the Army at home,and further requestedLord Derby to consider the suggested increase in the numberof men in Transport Workers&apos; Battalions, with a view toa larger proportion being kept in training as soldiers, andto report.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.WJ,November 30, 1917.
APPENDIX.(G.T.-2S04.) -Ministry of National Service and Control ok Labour.Joint Memorandum by the Minister of Munitions and the Minister of National Service.WE have carefully considered the Memoranda G.T.-2627 and G.T.-2G97, thefirst submitted by Sir Lynden Macassey, and the second by the ShipbuildingEmployers&apos; Federation, the Shipyard Trades Unions Standing Joint Committee, andthe Boilermakers&apos; Society.The latter propose that on all matters connected with the demand and supply oflabour in shipyards the Ministry of National Service should have full and sole control.It is justly pointed out later in this memorandum that such a proposal cannot be confined to the shipyard industry, but would necessarily have to be extended to otherindustries under the control of Government Departments.The general principles underlying this memorandum are the same as those uponwhich the War Cabinet based the functions of the Ministry of National Service. It isthe function of that Ministry to review the man-power of the country; to advise theWar Cabinet on questions of&apos; man-power ; and, subject to the directions of the WarCabinet, to allocate man-power to meet the needs of the armed forces and theindustrial demands of Government Departments&apos;; to ensure that such Departments areusing their labour to the best advantage ; and to secure the economical apportionmentof labour, both such as can be made available by internal adjustments within theDepartments themselves and such as can be obtained from external sources, in such away as to maintain the output of the most essential industries and the efficiency of essential public services.There is no difference as to the object which all parties are seeking to attain ; thequestion is how this object can be attained most expeditiously, without unnecessaryduplication of machinery, and in such a way as to secure the most cordial co-operationof employers and workmen.It is suggested in the shipbuilders&apos; memorandum that, in order to vest in theMinistry of -National Service the necessary power of review and general supervision and co-ordination, it will be necessary to transfer to the Ministry of National Servicecomplete control of labour supply and demand. Such a transfer would, we think,necessarily involve the transfer of responsibility for dilution from the GovernmentDepartments concerned to the Ministry of National Service, i.e., the actual arrangement of dilution in each particular case. We do not think that it is possible to separatedilution from supply. The most effective way of securing dilution is to say to a firm :&quot; Unless you dilute you shall not have contracts.&quot; Only the supply branches can do that. Only the supply branches can estimate the effect of dilution upon output.Further, such a transfer would lead to duplication of machinery because it would benecessary to attach something in the nature of a Labour Branch to the supply branchesof Government Departments.We are satisfied that the general purpose can be attained without so drastic andhazardous a change by strengthening the Labour Supply Department of the Ministryof National Service and the National Labour Priority Committee in the followingmanner: (a.) Duplicates of all Dilution Reports should be sent direct to the Ministry ofNational Service.(b.) A small skilled staff should be attached to the Ministry of National Service,selected from the existing dilution staffs of other Government Departments.Such a staff would be in a position, by reason of their expert knowledge and previous experience, to review the Dilution Reports and, in special cases where necessary, to make independent investigations and inspections.This proposal would, we think, give the Ministry of National Service the necessarypower of review and control without loading it with a mass of detailed administration,which would necessitate a very large, increase of staff, and a duplication of staff in theSupply Branches of other Departments.Whenever a demand was put forward in respect of a particular firm, the expertstaff would review the Dilution Report, if one existed ; or, if the firm had not beendiluted, would immediately make investigations as to why dilution had not been
Dundertaken, and how far dilution was possible. The Ministry of National service would thus be able to satisfy itself that Government Departments are carrying out allpossible internal adjustments, and the fullest extent of dilution practically possible ;and the Ministry wordd be able to review the activities of Government Departmentsnot only when they are applicants for further reinforcements of labour, but alsogenerally, so as to see whether a Department is failing to bring into the common poollabour which should be made available if the necessary internal adjustments anddilution were carried out.The Ministry of Munitions are prepared to assist the Ministry of National service by supplying part of the expert staff ; and we have no doubt that the Admiralty willbe willing in the general interest to adopt a similar course.We think that the foregoing considerations dispose of the proposal that theadministration of War Munitions Volunteers should be transferred to the Ministry ofNational Service. So far as such Volunteers are employed on Ministry of munitions work, no useful purpose would be served by a transfer. The Ministry of Munitionsare able to arrange a large amount of internal adjustment by shifting War MunitionsVolunteers from firms with less urgent contracts to firms with more urgent contracts,and they alone have sufficient detailed knowledge of each particular firm to do thiseffectively. The Minister of National Service is satisfied that the Ministry of Munitionsare carrying out these adjustments in a satisfactory manner, as is.proved by the largenumber of transfers which have been made internally to aircraft construction.It would be difficult, if not impossible, to transfer the administration of the minority of War Munitions Volunteers employed on Admiralty work, and even if itwere possible, we do not think that it would be expedient. The internal adjustmentscan best be performed by the Admiralty, and so far as War Munitions Volunteersbecome available for the common pool of labour they are disposed of under theinstructions issued by the National Labour Priority Committee, upon which all the\ Departments interested in labour are represented, whether they come from the Ministryof Munitions or the Admiralty.Further, when the Ministry of National Service has been strengthened by theaddition of an expert staff to review the Dilution Reports, and to make independentinvestigations, that Ministry will be in a position to decide whether larger numbers ofWar Munitions Volunteers now employed on Ministry of Munitions or Admiralty workcan be brought into the common pool, and will thus be able effectively to exercisethat measure of control which Sir Lynden Macassey and the other writers desire.Disputed cases will be referred to the National Labour Priority Committee as providedfor in the agreements between the Ministry of National Service and other GovernmentDepartments.The fact that War Work Volunteers are enrolled and administered by the Ministerof National Service does not afford either a logical or a direct reason for transferring the administration of War Munition Volunteers. War Work Volunteers are enrolledfor work of national importance for any Government Department ; they are a newcreation enrolled to meet specific demands as and when the need arises, and it is obviously convenient that their administration should be under the control of a single department, and that that Department should be the Ministry of National Service,&apos;which has enrolled and allocated them to specific demands, and which will, on theconclusion of such work, again endeavour to secure the allocation of their services.A. C. GEDDES.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.November 29, 1917.
