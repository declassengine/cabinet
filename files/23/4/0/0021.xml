The Western Front. 1. THE Director of Military Operations reported that a joint anglo-French attack hail begun that morning. No detail had beenreceived beyond an intimation that all was going well.War Office 2. The Director of Military Operations handed in a Paper forStatistical return.     circulation to the War Cabinet giving a comparison of the&apos; numberof days fighting, prisoners, guns, area of ground captured, Britishand estimated German casualties.Mercantile 3. The First Sea Lord reported heavy losses in the outwardShipping Losses.       trade to Gibraltar, which he attributed to lack of convoy cruisers.He had asked the Shipping controller for fifteen merchant ships with a view to fitting them out as cruisers.Dunkirk. ZL With reference to War Cabinet 240, Minute 14, the first sea Lord read a telegram from the Naval Liaison Officer to the effectthat General Retain was arranging for considerable additional provision to the air defences of Dunkirk.The Whitley With reference to War Cabinet 157, Minute 12, the WarEeport on Cabinet had before them a Report by the Ministry of Labour on theIndustrial Councils.   &quot;Attitude of Employers and  Employed to the Whitlev Report&quot;(Paper G.T.-2176).Dr. Addison explained that the Whitley Report recommendedthat the Government should ask the existing associations in each industry to organise themselves in such a way that they can adjust their difficulties and prepare for the period of reconstruction, and atthe same time increase the share of the workers in shaping theconditions under which they. work. It was very desirable toestablish, if possible, councils which would be representative of a trade as a whole, in place of the diverse organisations now often tobe found within a single trade. Once the War Cabinet approved the recommendations set forth by the Ministry of Labour, it wouldbe possible for the Ministry of Reconstruction to put forward anumber of suggestions indicating some functions which the industrial councils might discharge. There were important questions con-nected with the allocation of raw materials, increased production,commercial development, demobilisation, and so forth, in dealingwith which the proposed councils could possibly render most valuable assistance. He would formulate a number of suggestions on theselines, in co-operation with the Ministry of Labour, and if any newprinciple were raised it would, of course, be submitted to the WarCabinet.Sir David Shackleton said that, on the whole, the WhitleyReport had been very favourably received by the Trade Unions.Such criticism as had been expressed came either from the advocates of national guilds, who feared the adoption of the Whitley report would tend to improve industrial relations, or from highly organisedindustries like the cotton trade, where satisfactory machinery hadbeen evolved and where Government interference was not welcomed.There would be practical difficulties in setting up the councils, e.g.,the precise definition of the limits of a trade, but he thought theycould be surmounted. A report on the unorganised trades would follow.Mr. J ellaway.. stated, that the Whitley Report had alreadystimulated the formation of Shop Committees, and there were now a number of them in the National Factories.
Defence of the realm(Acquisition ofLand) Bill.Allocation of guns to our allies.Trade War.The War Cabinet decided To endorse the principle of the Whitley Report, and approved the steps proposed to be taken by the Ministry of labour for setting up Industrial Councils, as set forth in paper g.T.-2176.6. The War Cabinet considered a memorandum by theSecretary of State for War on the acquisition of land for purposesconnected with the war, together with a draft of a Bill to amend the Defence of the Realm (Acquisition of Land) Act, 191G (paper g.T-2153), and a note by the Chief Secretary for Ireland(Paper G.T.-2195).Lord Derby explained that the present practice, when land was required, was to proceed under the Defence of the realm regulations and to refer applicants for compensation to the Defenceof the Realm Losses Commission, but no legal right to compensation was admitted. Doubts, however, had recently been cast on thelegal position when the Shoreham Aerodrome case was before theHouse of Lords, and the object of the present Bill was to removethese doubts by enabling the Defence of the Realm LossesCommission to assess damages.Sir Edward Carson said the Bill was a very mild one, andaimed at putting a stop to petitions of right claiming compensationfor damage on a peace basis, it was desirable to put an end to theextravagant claims for direct and consequential losses which werebeing advanced. This the Bill did. The Bill was comprehensive,so far as the acquisition of land went, but there were analogousproblems connected with other forms of property.The War Cabinet, while approving the principle of the Bill,were of opinion that it would be preferable, if possible, to introduceone Bill dealing with the various kinds of property disturbed bythe war, rather than a series of Bills, and requested -Sir Edward Carson to examine the subject from this standpointand to report.7. On the suggestion of the Secretary of State for War the WarCabinet appointed the following Committee : Lord Curzon, Chairman,Mr. Balfour,Lord Derby,Mr. Churchill,Captain Amery, Secretary,to consider the allocation of guns in relation to the demands putforward by our own armies and by those of the Allied Governments.8. The War Cabinet discussed the whole question of the tradewar against Germany raised by Sir Edward Carson&apos;s memorandumon the Economic Offensive (Paper G.-156) (Appendix I), and furtherdealt with in memoranda by-the Board of Trade (Paper G.-158),Lord R. Cecil (Paper G.-159), Dr. Addison. (Paper G.T.-2170), andand Mr. Montagu (Paper G.T.-2239). The importance of makingthe fullest use of the economic lever in possession of the Allies to counteract the territorial lever which the Germans possess in their occupation of Allied territory was emphasised, and it was suggestedthat a strong Committee should be appointed to study the question from the British point of view as a preliminary to a comprehensiveagreement with France and the United States as to a policy ofcommon action.It was pointed out that the questions under considerationaffected not only the United Kingdom, but the British Empire as a
whole, and that any policy agreed upon would require the co-opera-tion of the Dominion and Indian Governments. The desirability of keeping labour in touch with the question was also urged, moreparticularly with reference to the recent pronouncement of theTrades Union Congress at Blackpool in favour of Free Tradg. Itwas pointed out, however, that the question of the Economic Offensiveis not directly connected with that of our future fiscal policy, and,indeed, that, in so far as we use our powers of economic control forthe purposes of co-operation with our Allies or bargaining with theenemy, we to that extent limit our absolute freedom in the matter ofa restrictive economic, policy.Lord R. Cecil expressed the hope that the deliberations of theCommittee should not preclude the active continuance of theEconomic Offensive on existing lines. He drew attention to suchspecific proposals as that put forward by M. Clementel, Mr. Montagu,and others, for threatening to increase the severity of our post-Warmeasures in proportion to the further continuance of the War byGermany ; the Statutory Black List ; the Board of Trade proposalfor something in the nature of a Metal Bank to counteract the greatGermau combinations for dealing in metals; and - the financialblockade.The War Cabinet decided To appoint a Committee which, without prejudice to the effective continuance of the existing Economic Offensive,should consider the whole question, with a view to their recommendations being utilised as the basis of further consultations with the French and United states government, the Committee to consist of Sir Edward Carson, Chairman.Mr. Barnes.The Secretary of State for the Colonies.he President of the Board of Trade.The Minister of Blockade.The Minister of Reconstruction.Mr. Stanley Baldwin, Joint Financial Secretary to theTreasury.Captain Amery, Secretary.The War Cabinet decided that-t-An announcement with regard to the appointment of thisCommittee, and to our consultation with our Allies, shouldbe postponed until the Board of Trade had dealt withM. ClementePs proposal.The War Cabinet further decided, with reference tothe proposals contained in the Board of Trade memorandum&apos;(Paper G.-J.58), that The dye industry is to be regarded as a war industry for all purposes.Air Raids and 9. The War Cabinet had before them a . memorandum by the bombing of Chief of the Imperial General Staff on the subject of Air Raids andGermany. Bombing of Germany (Paper G.T.-223 1).Attention was drawn to the following passage in paragraph 4 : &apos;&apos; Though we have been enabled to give Sir Douglas Haigsufficient machines to maintain a certain superiority in the air,he has not yet, by any means, received what he has asked forand what he ought to have. In June 1916 he asked for 53squadrons to be completed by the spring of 1917.   He is still
squadrons below that, figure. In November 19.16 he askedfor 20 more fighting squadrons and 10 more bombing squadrons.None of these he has yet received. The necessity for pressing forward the output of-aircraft, so us to meet these requirements,was several times brought to the notice of the War Cabinetsome months ago e.g., see proceedings of the 15th December,5th March, Kith April, Nth May, and 14th June. As to theother theatres of war Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Salonica areeach one squadron, and Lord French two squadrons, short of present requirements.&quot;The Prime Minister pointed out that this seemed to imply somereflection either on the War Cabinet, the Air Board, the Ministry ofMunitions or some other Department.&apos; He produced figures to showthat the Air Board, since it had coine into existence, had producedtwice as many aeroplanes in nine months as the War Office had produced in the previous year, and that by the end of the presentyear the Air Board would have supplied three times the number thatthe War Office had produced in 1916.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that his memorandum was not intended to reflect on the Air Board or anyother Government Department, but to set forth certain admittedfacts and to assist in stimulating the output of aircraft, at the expenseof some other service if necessary. Aircraft were, in his opinion,probably in the same position as other war material for instance,we had not as many guns as we should like.General Kobertsou said that lie felt it to be his duty, when theWar Cabinet were considering the policy of raids on German towns,to draw their attention to the fact of which they did not appearto be aware -that our Field - Marshal in France was short of machines.With reference to the statement that Sir Douglas Haie; is1^ squadrons short of the 53 he had asked for 18 months ago,&quot;Lord Cowdray pointed out that, although the fact was correct, this did not represent the whole case. Obsolescent types had beendiscarded and more up-to-date machines substituted, and this fact,together with the absorption of a large proportion of new machines fortraining purposes, had prevented Field-Marshal Haig&apos;s demandsbeing fully met.General Henderson explained that the demands for homedefence. Egypt, and Mesopotamia had also retarded the completionof the 53 squadrons. In regard to the statement that none of the20 additional fighting squadrons and 10 bombing squadrons hadbeen supplied, General Henderson explained that it was impossibleto provide large quantities of additional material in less than a year.All Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s demands could haAre been met had it notbeen for the additional requirements both for the ExpeditionaryForce in France and for the other theatres mentioned above.Moreover, these additional requirements had been notified just atthe time when the Air Board had the difficult task of deciding onthe merits of three alternative powerful engines. Large quantities,however, of new aircraft of the latest type would be forthcomingduring the winter.In reply to an enquiry as to why, having regard to the largely increased output of machines this year, it had not been possible tomeet the additional demands, Sir William Weir explained that aconsiderable part of the present year&apos;s output had been devoted tothe replacement of obsolete material.On the general question of the desirability of conducting raids on German towns, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff recapitu-lated. the main objections to carrying out such a policy, at any rate at the present time, viz., the fact that our air forces at, the frontwere engaged in a daily and desperate struggle to obtain airsupremacy on the Western front; that any withdrawal of machinesfor the purpose of raids must endanger that supremacy ; and that a
very strong justification was necessary for a policy of raids, so longas the season was favourable for Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s operations in flanders. In this connection Lord Cowdray pointed out that, onthe intervention of the War Cabinet, the Air Board had recently had an unexpected windfall owing to the retention in this country of fifty machines which had been promised to Russia; these machines, he suggested, could be utilised for long-distance raidswithout robbing the Expeditionary Force.The Minister of Munitions stated that, so far as the future was concerned, he did not think the difficulty would be machines. Itwas, of course, possible that his Ministry might not be able torealise the full programme, but he anticipated that the output of aircraft, over and above the number recpiired to replace wastage,would, by the middle of next year, give an aggregate of a con-siderable number of squadrons which coidd be allotted for long-distance offensives.General Henderson pointed out that in winter the rate of wastage of machines was less than in summer months, butthat the training of pilots in the winter season could not be com-pleted as quickly as at other times of the year. In regard to thelatter problem, however, efforts were being made to solve it by theestablishment of aerodromes for training purposes in countries Avherethe winter climate was more suitable..10. The Secretary of State for War informed the War Cabinetthat he had received three communications from Lord Northcliffestating that the extent to which the French and Italians wereadvertising the exploits of their airmen, and their respectiveaerial activities generally, was seriously impairing our own prestige in this respect in the United States, and was creating a falseand unfortunate impression. Lord Derby stated that he proposedto take suitable steps to remedy this.Inter-Ally Council. 11. Lord Curzon referred to the decisions of the War cabinet at their meeting held on the 2(Jth September, 1917 (War Cabinet239, Minute 12), when it was agreed, inter alia, that the generalscheme contained in his memorandum (Paper G.T.-2065) should beadopted, that the reply from the. American Government in regard tothe Chairman of the Inter-Ally Council should be awraited before any further action was taken, and that he should see Mr. bonar law in regard to the services of Mr. Austen Chamberlain. lord curzon reminded the War Cabinet that he had recommended thatthe three British representatives on the Council should be general smuts (whose consent to serve had already been obtained), LordBuckmaster, and Mr. Austen Chamberlain, the last named to act as chairman of the British Priority Committee on the Council, and tobe our chief representative.Lord Curzon stated that the United States Government had now intimated their willingness to appoint a Chairman, and it onlyremained for the War Cabinet to select the other two british representatives.After some discussion, in the course of which the names ofvarious prominent members of the Liberal party were mentioned aspossible alternatives to Lord Buckmaster, the War Cabinet decidedthat Lord Curzou&apos;s recommendations in regard to the british personnel on the Inter-Ally Council should be approved,Lord Curzon undertaking to draft for the Prime Ministerletters to Lord Buckmaster and Mr. Austen Chamberlainrespectively, inviting them to serve on the Council.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,October 9, 1917.Propaganda inAerial Matters.
