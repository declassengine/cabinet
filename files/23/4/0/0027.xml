Pacifist Activities 1. THE War Cabinet had before them the following documents in Great Britain.      on the subject of pacifist activities in Great Britain : (a.) Notes of a Conference (Paper G.T.-733).(b.) Memorandum by Sir Edward Carson (Paper G.-157).(c.) Memorandum by the Ministry of Labour (Paper G.T.-2274).While credit was given to the great value of the weekly reportsof the Ministry of Labour, it was pointed out that these reports by no means covered the whole field of pacifist activities in this country.It was particularly desirable to investigate the sources from whichthe funds for purposes of anti-war propaganda were being obtained.For example, a case had recently been brought to light in which thepacifists had been refused the use of a hall in Bradford for thepurpose of holding meetings, and, on receipt of the refusal, hadbought the hall for the sum of 18,000Z. It was suspected that anti-war propaganda was being financed by wealthy men, who werelooking forward to making money by opening up trade withGermany after the war, and it was rumoured that certain financierswere already entering into post-war contracts with a view to makingprofits out of German trade.The Home Secretary stated that he had received a report from scotland Yard on the whole subject, but that he was not whollysatisfied with it.A great deal of information was being obtained by differentGovernment Departments, notably by the War Office, and, though there was full co-operation between the Home Office, the War Office,and the Ministry of Labour, the information was not collated insuch a form as to be readily available for members of the WarCabinet. It was suggested that international organisations requiredspecial attention, and that particular care should be taken to inves-tigate the books of suspected institutions and of closed Germanbanks.The War Cabinet decided that The Home Office should undertake the co-ordination and controlof the investigation of all pacifist propaganda and of the wider subjects connected therewith, referred to above, andshould submit a full report to the War Cabinet, who wouldthen decide as to whether periodical reports should besubmitted on the subject.The Stockholm 2. With reference to War Cabinet 217, Minute 16, the PrimeConference. Minister stated that he had learned from French Ministers thatdocumentary evidence had been obtained by them to the effect thatthe International Socialistic Conference at Stockholm had beenengineered by the German Government.The War Cabinet decided that The Foreign Office should endeavour to obtain copies of these documents.Prohibition of the 3. With reference to War Cabinet 119, Minute 24, Lord DerbyExport of &quot; The suggested that, in view of the recent improved tone and conductNation.&quot; of the &quot; Nation,&quot; the embargo upon its export might now beremoved.The War Cabinet concurred in this proposal.
WC 253Propaganda :Suggested Visit ofWorkers andOthers to theTheatres of War.4. The War Cabinet had before them the following papers onthe subject of visits of workers, farmers, and others to the theatres of war: fa.) Memorandum by Sir Edward Carson (Paper G-.T.-2268).&apos;(&amp;.) Memorandum by Mr. Munro (Paper G.T.-2265).(c.) Memorandum by Mr. Prothero (Paper G.T.-2300).The Secretary of State for War, while wholly favourable to theprinciple of affording facilities for persons to visit the British front and the devastated areas in France, stated that the main difficulty was one of accommodation. He had decided to send a specialCommissioner to France to investigate this question and to reportwhat could be done.It was pointed out that visits to the front formed the very besteducation for propagandists in this country. Reports had beenreceived showing that the meetings held by the War AimsCommittee had already done good work, especially in Yorkshire.The War Cabinet approved in principle that there should be greater facilities for war-workers, farmers, and especially for Members of Parliament, to visit the front; the detains to be arranged between Sir Edward Carson and theSecretary of State for War.Bills dealing with 5. The War Cabinet had before them a report, prepared at theirbrThr W118^^    re1uest&apos; by Sir Edward Carson (War Cabinet 247, Minute 6), on the^   e   ar&apos; subject of Bills dealing with property disturbed by the war, in which sir Edward Carson advised that both the BLU to amend the Defenceof the Realm (Acqrusition of Land) Act, 1916, and the Bill to make further provision with respect to the requisition of ships in connectionwith the present war, are necessary, and, in his opinion, should beintroduced separately. Sir Edward Carson also advised that theOrder, under the Defence of the Realm Act, relating to therequisition of beans, &amp;c. (War Cabinet 244, Minute 1), should bevalidated by Act of Parliament and not included in either of the bills referred to above.The War Cabinet approved Sir Edward Carson&apos;s report.Publication of 6. With reference to the figures for   officers&apos; casualties inCasualties. August and September, published by the War Office by direction ofthe War Cabinet (War Cabinet 251, Minute 4), the &quot;Chief of the.Imperial General Staff consulted the War Cabinet as to a parliamentary question on the subject by Mr. Richard Lambert,quoting the figures published by the War Office, and suggesting that the list of casualties to officers should now be published foreach of the other months of the current year.The War Cabinet decided that It was not in the public interest to publish this information ; ifgiven, it would inevitably lead to a demand for the figuresof casualties to other ranks. The answer should be in the sense that all casualties were published.Release of guns for the Anti-Aircraft Defenceof London.7. With reference to War Cabinet 250, Minute 2, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff stated that he was given to understandthat the Admiralty would not be able to supply more than the 16anti-aircraft guns previously promised, which would leave a shortageof 24.The First Sea Lord stated that the matter was still under
consideration by the Board of Admiralty, who would, be thought,place the facts before the War Cabinet for decision.8. The First Sea Lord reported that an air raid was carried outon Varssonaere Aerodrome on the morning of the 18th October,many bombs being, dropped and sheds straddled. All our machinesreturned safely.H.M.S. &quot;Terror.&quot; 9. The First Sea Lord stated that the monitor &quot;Terror&quot; was hit by one or two torpedoes and&apos; two or three shells from destroyerson the night of the 18th-19th October while at anchor off Dunkirk.She had several compartments flooded, but the bulges with which she was fitted probably prevented her from foundering. The vesselwould shortly be docked.   The crew sustained no casualties.Air Raid onVarssonaereAerodrome.Air said on 10. The First Sea Lord informed the War Cabinet that theChanak.    - Rear-Admiral, -aegean Sea, reports that, the arrival of the Kaiser at chanak being expected, four bombing aeroplanes were sent to make an attack at midnight on the 17th-l8th October. A bombing raid was made at dawn with all available force. A full report of operations had not yet been received, but one of our machines hadnot returned.Submarines.11. The First Sea Lord reported that (a.) On the 18th instant a seaplane had dropped four 1001b.bombs on a submarine while her periscope was showingin the vicinity of the Scillies. A large quantity of oilwas afterwards observed.(p.) A seaplane attacked a submarine in the vicinity of Portlandon the 18th instant, two bombs exploding on the top ofthe wash while the submarine was submerging. the pilot believes the submarine was sunk. Oil was observedto rise.(c.) H.M.S. &quot;afridi&quot; reports having attacked a submarine inthe vicinity of the North Varne Buoy. Four depth charges were dropped, after which dense oil appearedon the surface. 1Losses bySubmarines orMines.Arrivals andSailings.12. The First Sea Lord gave the following comparative figuresof losses by submarines or mines, and arrivals and sailings for thetwo periods the 1st to 17th September inclusive and the 1st to17th October inclusive : In September the total arrivals and sailings amounted to 13,191.50 British ships were sunk, of a total tonnage of 113,663 tons, and36 Allied and neutral vessels, of 70,808 tons, making a grand total,including fishing vessels, of 184,716 tons.For the period the 1st to .17th October inclusive the arrivalsand sailings amounted to 11,376. 34&quot; British ships were sunk, of a gross tonnage of 120,166 tons, and 32 Allied and neutral ships ofa gross tonnage of 87,054 tons, making a grand total, includingfishing vessels, of 70 ships of a tonnage of 207,387.Attack on Convoyby German light cruisers.13. With reference to War Cabinet 252, Minute 7, the First sea lord read to the War Cabinet the intercepted wireless messagegiving the German report on the convoy incident. He stated thathe had received no further report from the Senior Naval Officer
Eussia: 14. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read telegramBequests for Naval No. 1649, dated the 18th October, from the British Ambassador,Co-operation. Petrograd, which, after describing the deplorable naval situation,ended with the suggestion that the man in the street is utterlyignorant of naval warfare, and that, if the Russian Fleet wa3destroyed without any attempt being made by the British Fleet tocome to its assistance, the impression would gain ground that russia had been abandoned by her Ally and that the only courseleft was to make peace with Germany.The First Sea Lord explained the impossibility of the entry ofthe British Fleet into the Baltic. There was not a sufficient depth of water to allow the Fleet to pass through the Sound; the LittleBelt was close to German territory, and to pass in safety throughthe Great Belt would necessitate infringing Danish neutrality byoccupying Danish Islands. Further, there would be the difnciilty ofmaintaining the communications of any force which succeeded inentering the Baltic.The question was raised as to whether, if no direct assistance could be given, some diversion could be made in the North Sea todraw off the German Fleet. In this connection the First Sea Lordpointed out that the German Fleet had only detached a relatively small force against the Russians, including half-a-dozen Dread-noughts ; the Russians were putting up but a very feeble defence with their own forces, and there seems to be very little intelligenceshown in the command ; the four newest and best Russian Dread-noughts had not yet moved. All our submarines in the Baltic were operating except one under repair. Apparently only two Russiansubmarines were moving. British forces had been operating forsome time in the North Sea and Heligoland Bight with a view toattracting the Germans, but without result; short of attacking coast defences we were, actually doing everything possible to tempt theGerman Fleet to engage us, and attacks on German coast defences,even if they could be undertaken, would take many months toprepare.The War Cabinet decided that A telegram explaining these points should be sent to Russia,the material being supplied- to the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs by the First Lord of the Admiralty.The question was discussed whether some &quot; sting &quot; should beput into this telegram, indicating that if they want assistance from us the Russians must at least make a determined effort on their ownbehalf.Mr. Balfour undertook to consider this point, and to show thedraft of the telegram to the Prime Minister.in the Shetlands, and had telegraphed asking for any&apos; further particulars. In any case, the German report was incorrect in two matters, namely: (a.) Their statement that the action took place in territorial waters, whereas it happened about sixty miles from land.(6.) That all the convoy was sunk, as we had certainknowledge that three of the convoy had reached harbour.It was mentioned that this information would be known in the scandinavian countries, and therefore it was desirable that weshould publish our account of the incident.The War Cabinet requested The First Lord of the Admiralty to issue a notice in the pressas soon as the next-of-kin of those lost had been informed and all relevant facts had been ascertained from the shetlands.
Requisition ofVessels building in the UnitedStates of America.15. The War Cabinet had under consideration a letter fromthe Shipping Controller enclosing a telegram from his representa-tive in the United States of America, as well as the draft of a reply on the subject of the requisition of vessels building in the UnitedStates of America for the British Government (Paper G.T.-2313).The suggestion of the Shipping Controller was to accept the presidents decision without question, to explain our position onthe subject, and to point out that their action prevented us fromhelping our Allies to the same extent as hitherto. Sir J. Maclay saidthat information had just come to hand showing that the UnitedStates were actually opening new commercial lines with SouthAmerica. There was evidence, indeed, that the United States were out for post bellum development, of which they always suspected us.The Controller of the Admiralty, while approving a full state-ment of the effect on supply of the action of the United States ofAmerica, favoured the maintenance of our contracts in order thatopportunities might be obtained of representing, from time to time,to the Shipping Board the uses to which we had intended to devotethe ships, as each of them was completed. It was important to presson the Americans the difficulties which would arise by the diversion of these ships from supply to transport.The Shipping Controller expressed the view that it may become more important to bring wheat than troops from the United States.M. Clementel had shown that the wheat situation in France was most critical, this years harvest being 4,000,000 tons as against9,000,000 in a normal year. The French were making a heavy-demand upon us for assistance. The situation was equally grave in italy, and during the last two days twenty Italian ships had beensent to America for wheat, thus depriving us of 100,000 tons of orethis month, and breaking the agreement into which they had entered.The First Lord suggested that the message should also dealwith the oil situation. The difficulties of supplying oil for our own needs and those of the Allies wovdd be most seriously increased ifoil-tankers were requisitioned.The War Cabinet approved That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should see theUnited States Ambassador, and should hand to him astatement incorporating into the Shipping Controllersdraft message the additions suggested by the Controller ofthe Admiralty and the First Lord.Oil v. Coal Ships. 16. The Shipping Controller called attention to the inadvisabilityof proceeding with the building of oil-burning ships, owing to thedifficulty of securing an adequate oil supply. We were bringingoil to the extent of from 80,000 to 100,000 tons a month in doublebottoms, and but for the good-will of the United States we shouldhave been in a very perilous position. Some time ago enemy submarines had sought out oil-tankers for special attack. Hethought the whole position should be reviewed by the Admiralty.The First Lord said, that the comparative advantages of oil- and coal-burning craft had been repeatedly discussed, and a few months ago the Admiralty had ascertained that no change of the present programme could take effect before the end of 1918. The question was being considered whether it might not be desirable to buildsome coal-burning destroyers for delivery after the end of 1918.Proposed 17. The War Cabinet had before them a letter from ViscountFormation of Bryce to the Prime Minister, covering a memorial from a number of league of Nations,   representative, public men, suggesting the establishment of a small committee of British and American experts to examine the estab-
lishment of some machinery for the preservation of a permanentpeace by a combination of free, peace-loving nations (paper g.T.-2293).The War Cabinet decided To adjourn the matter until there had been an opportunity of discussing it with the representative of President Wilson,who was shortly expected in this country.18. The War Cabinet had under consideration a note by theSecretary (Paper G.T.-2299) relative to the Forth-Clyde Canal, and decided that The question of the desirabily of the construction of the Forth-Clyde Canal should be examined in all its aspects by theMinister of Reconstruction, in conjunction with theGovernment Departments concerned.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,October 19, 1917.
