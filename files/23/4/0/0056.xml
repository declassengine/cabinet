THE War Cabinet discussed the procedure to be adopted atthe forthcoming meeting of the Inter-Allied Conference and of theSupreme War Council at Paris and Versailles respectively. It wasagreed that&apos;the question of military policy depended to a very great extent upon the shipping situation, as set forth in a memorandumby the Shipping Controller entitled &quot; The Shipping Situation and american Assistance&quot; (Paper G.T.-2728).The War Cabinet decided that (a.) The Shipping Controller should be asked to attend the conferences.(b.) The Prime Minister, in his preliminary interview withM. Clemenceau, should lay the utmost stress upon thesupreme importance of the shipping situation, andshould, if possible, arrange for this subject to bediscussed by the experts at an early stage of theproceedings.
Italian Labour. 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported to theCabinet that he had received a request from Field-marshal sir Douglas Haig asking for Italian labour to assist the Britishtroops in France. &apos;.. m .1The War Cabinet agreed that pressure should be applied at theforthcoming Conference to obtain Italian labour, as requested by-Sir Douglas Haig.Salonica: 3. With reference to War Cabinet 279, Minute 6, the Chief ofGeneral Sarrail. the Imperial General Staff stated that the only report received fromGeneral Sarrail, in response to requests, was a meagre statemen tregarding the disposition of certain units. He desired to draw theattention of the War Cabinet to the continued inadequacy of our information regarding the Allied situation on the Salonica front.Palestine:J erusalem.4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported to the WarCabinet a telegram from General Allenby asking what flags, if any,should be hoisted in the event of an Allied occupation of the city of jerusalem.The War Cabinet decided that In view of the unique character of the city and of the manydifficult political and diplomatic questions that were raised in connection with it, General Allenby should be informedthat no flags should be hoisted in the event of theoccupation of the city by Allied troops.The Invasion ofItaly.5. The Chief of the Imperial General staff reported that he hadreceived a telegram from General Plumer stating that the italians were very much pleased with the way in which their troops hadwithstood enemy attacks during the last few days. A telegramfrom General Delme-Radcliffe stated that both the 27th Corps andthe 6th Corps of the Italian Army, who had been among the worstbehaved during the debacle, were now re-formed and were re-entering the line. General Robertson stated that the railways were now available for the transport of the two further British Divisions that had been ordered to join General PlumeFs force. In view of the improved situation in Italy, he personally regretted their departureto the Italian front, where they now might not be required sourgently. However, in view of the fact that General Plumer had informed both the French and the Italians that these two divisions were coming, he did not feel justified in counter-ordering them without, definite Cabinet instructions.The War Cabinet decided that It was impracticable, to stop the two further Divisions fromproceeding to Italy as ordered.Submarines.6. The First Sea Lord reported that (a.) The German submarine &quot; U 48 &quot; had been driven ashoreon the Goodwin Sands by our patrol boats on Saturday.After a lively engagement, lasting twenty minutes, theGerman submarine was destroyed, I officer and 21 men&apos; being rescued prisoners, the remainder being eitherkilled or drowned.(6.) The trawler &quot; Delphinus &quot; reported having dropped depth charges in the immediate neighbourhood of an enemy submarine. Oil appeared upon the surface, and therewas a probability that the submarine was severely damaged.
(c.) One of our trawlers off Flamborough Head claimed to have sunk a German submarine.(d.) The French naval authorities reported the destruction ofan enemy submarine in the A!mediterranean.7. With reference to War Cabinet 281, Minute 4, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff read a telegram, dated Petrograd, the22nd November, from General Knox, stating that, quite apart fromthe action of the Government authorities, the Russian troops at thefront were insisting upon an armistice. It appeared quite clearthat, whatever happened politically in Russia, the bulk of theRussian army refused to continue the war. He also read atelegram from General Barter (No. 1378), despatched from roumania on the 23rd November, stating that he had handed to theCommander-in-Chief of the Russian armies, General Dukhonen, a formal and strongly-worded protest, signed by the military repre-sentatives of Great Britain, France, Italy, Roumania, and Japan,against any infraction of the Treaty of London, dated the 5thSeptember, 1914.The War Cabinet approved the action taken by General Barter.The Prime Minister then read to the Cabinet telegram No. 1862,dated the 24th November, from Sir George Buchanan, and No. 700,of the same cute, from Sir G. Barclay (Jassy).The Chief of the Imperial General Staff also read a telegramfrom General Ballard, to the effect that the Ukranians were anxiousto make peace at the earliest possible moment.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that the italian ambassador, Count Imperiab. had been to see him, at the request ofBaron Sonnino, regarding the situation in Roumania. there appeared to be considerable discrepancy between the telegram received bv the Italians and the telegram above alluded to, viz.,No. 700 from Sir G. Barclay.The War Cabinet took the view that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentcould not in any way countenance any suggestion that the roumanians should make a separate peace witb the enemy, and-agreed that it was desirable that the Roumanians should get into touch as soon as possible with those Russian leaders who were stillprepared to continue the war.The War Cabinet decided To leave the form and method of communication to Sir edward carson and Mr. Balfour, who were meeting certain expertsat the Foreign Office the same afternoon to discuss thisparticular situation.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,November 26, 1917.
