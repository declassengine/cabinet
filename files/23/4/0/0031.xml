Food Situation inFrance and Italy.1. LORD MILNER stated that M. elemental, the french minister of Commerce, was still in London and was pressing for the recognition of an agreed minimum of food requirements for theUnited Eingdom, France, and Italy respectively, and asked thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government should assent to the principle that suchagreed indispensable requirements should have absolute priority.It was pointed out that it was quite impossible to consider this question piecemeal, the whole question of shipping prioritiesfor ore, oil, coal, and munitions, being raised as well as the questionof food priorities. At this moment we were 100,000 tons short ofour monthly requirement of iron-ore, and had scarcely reached aposition of safety in regard to oil.Beyond these questions of shipping priorities, there was thequestion of military policy, which also affected shipping, and it was urged that we should not commit ourselves to any pledge to poolresources until we were absolutely sure of the facts and until theGovernments of the countries involved had examined the question as a whole.The Prime Minister stated that the Italian Ambassador had called on him that morning and had handed him an urgent request for assistance to Italy in respect of food. The Italian ambassador had given him a very bad account, from his personal experienceduring a recent visit to Italy, regarding the food situation in thatcountry.It was pointed out that, even if the French harvest was con-siderably below the normal, there mast still be plenty of food inthat country. The French demands amounted to a request that weshould supply their deficiencies because the French Governmentwas too weak to compel their own peasants to stop hoarding. Onthe other hand, it was pointed out that, sooner or later, real and notapparent deficiencies would make themselves felt in France, andthat it would be necessary to give assistance in this matter. It was mentioned that the French Government had not established any satisfactory system of control or limitation of consumption, whichwould result in effective economies even to the same extent aseconomies being effected voluntarily in this country. Reports werecurrent showing that in the country districts in France consumption was normal, if not excessive.The War Cabinet decided that (a-)., Lord Milner should reply to M. elemental to the effect thatthe first step was to establish the facts by a methodsatisfactory to all concerned, but that while this examination was in progress it was impossible for the, . British Government to pledge themselves to poolresources ;(6) The Prinle Minister should make a similar reply to SignorArlotti ;(c) Sir Albert Stanley, in concert with the Food Controller andthe Shipping Controller, should report to the WarCabinet on the whole question, after investigating it with M. Clementel and Signor Arlotti.Threatened strike on the FrenchRailways.2. The Secretary of State for War reported to the Cabinet thathe had received a letter from Paris stating that a strike on theFrench railways was threatened during the early days of November.This letter also stated that a delegate, or delegates, were expected inFrance from the British railway linions with regard to the possibleattitude of the English railwaymen employed in France in the eventof a French strike. -The War Cabinet asked the Secretary of State for War to send the Papers to the President of the Board of Trade and ask him to see
Conscientious 3. The War Cabinet had before them the report of the CabinetObjectors. Committee established by War Cabinet 246, Minute 1 (Paper G.T.-2321), and also a Memorandum by Lord Milner (Paper G.T.-2354).Sir George Cave stated that, with the exception of Mr. H. A. L-.Fisher, every member of the Committee was in substantial agree-ment with the report. On one point, however, there was a divisionof opinion, namely, the period of time during which hard labour should be served before any mitigation of treatment should be metedout by the prison authorities to those men who were undergoingsentence of imprisonment with hard labour for continued refusal toobey military orders, alleging conscientious objection to so doing.He himself thought that this period should be twelve months, andnot less, while several members of the Committee were of opinionthat four or six months was a sufficiently long sentence of hardlabour, and that thereafter this class of Conscientious Objector,usually called &quot; Absolutists,&quot; might receive the benefit of the appli-cation of Prison Regulation 243 a.Mr. H. A. L. Fisher, wdio was&apos; unavoidably prevented fromattending, had written a letter to the effect that he favoured therelease of these Absolutists after a certain period of sentence hadrun, subject, of course, to their reincarceration, under the Defenceof the Realm Act, in the event of their indulging in propaganda orotherwise attempting to subvert the working of the militar&apos; service acts.General Childs stated that the latest figures regarding thenumber of persons now undergoing sentence alleging conscientiousobjection to military service were as follows : Men who refused to plead   ...       ...       ...       ...      562Men rejected by the Central Tribunal as not beingtrue Conscientious Objectors ...       ...       ...      289Men who had been before the Central Tribunal,but who refused to accept work of national importance in lieu of imprisonment  ...       ...      306Men who had been released from prison andemployed upon work of national importance,but who had been returned to prison formisconduct      ...       ...       ...       ...      ...      252Total number of persons alleging conscientiousobjection now in prison ...       ...       ...   1,409Lord Milner expressed the view that, if a man was willingto undergo several terms of the severest sentence known to the criminal law, and his past record showed that he was a man of religious scruple, that man should be exempted from furthermilitary service, on.condition that he did not abuse his liberty. Inhis opinion, the intention of the Military Service Act was to grantexemption to such persons. He pointed out that about 400Conscientious Objectors had been granted absolute exemption byLocal or Appeal Tribunals, notably at York, where a number ofQuakers had been exempted. It seemed to be a matter of luck asto whether a Conscientious Objector ran up against a Tribunal thatwas willing to exempt Conscientious Objectors, or against onewhich was not. Some Conscientious Objectors had thus receivedabsolute exemption, while similar characters were doing two yearshard labour. Mr. I. G. Gibbon pointed out that a large proportionof those who had obtained tribunal exemption were already doinghospital of other war work.Mr. Long recalled the fact that he was in charge of the. J. H. Thomas, M.P., Organising Secretary of the amalgamated society of Railway Servants, and decided that Under no circumstances should the delegates going to Francebe searched at Southampton or Havre.
Military Service Act when it was passed, and that all the militaryauthorities at that time had said that if once the door was opened toexemption from all service on conscientious grounds there would beno end to it, and the whole purpose and structure of the MilitaryService Act would crumple. If men were to be let out of prisonnow and exempted from the duty of further service, others, whohad enlisted and were actually serving at the Front, would putforward conscientious objection to further service. He pointed outthat public opinion had hardened against the Conscientious Objectorsince the time that the Military Service Act was passed. Thepublic felt very strongly that intolerable injustice would be done ifthe Government allowed Conscientious Objectors to go scot-free from all duty to the State, while men in single charge of businesses,men with large families, and men who were the sole support of awidowed mother, were being compelled to join the army underextremely hard personal circumstances. He did not believe thatthere would be any substantial outcry even if one of these Con-scientious Objectors died in prison, and if any attempt were madeby the Government to alter the law or to release conscientious objectors, there would be violent attacks upon the Government bothinside and outside Parliament. He pointed out that, since our military Service Act was passed, similar Acts had been passed by three of our Dominions and by the United States of America ; andin no case did these Governments allow absolute exemption onconscientious grounds.Mr. Hayes Fisher associated himself with Mr. Long&apos;s view.Lord Salisbury, formerly the Chairman of the Central Tribunal,stated that he was opposed to letting these men out of prison, but thought that twelve months&apos; hard labour was too long a period before mitigating prison treatment. He quite agreed thatTribunals, who on the whole had done very well, had made considerable mistakes in dealing with this matter, and thatthere had been inequality of treatment. With regard to the menwho refused to plead, he thought that the majority of them wereconscientious, and would get the benefit of being offered thealternative of the Home Office scheme for employment on Dartmooror elsewhere, if they would consent to plead.Lord Derby urged the War Cabinet not to reduce the period before which mitigation commenced below twelve months, because he feared some growth in the number of Conscientious Objectors ifany mitigation were granted.The War Cabinet decided, with Lord milner&apos;s dissent, that Under no circumstances should absolute exemption from servicebe granted to men alleging conscientious objection, nowundergoing sentences in prison, but that men who have served a period, to be determined by the Home Secretary,but not exceeding 12 months, with hard labour, shouldreceive mitigation of prison treatment.The Western Front. 4. The Director of Military Operations stated that information had been received from Sir . Douglas Haig that a heavy counter-attack which had been made on the Allied lines in the vicinity ofHoutbulst Forest had been repulsed.Captures.5. The Director of Military Operations stated that the captureson the Western front between the 1st January and the 24th October,1917, were :-British-380 guns.59,550 prisoners.French 298 guns.52,600 prisoners (&quot;including those in the latest Frenchoffensive).
The Italian Front. 6. General Maurice stated that information had heen receivedfrom General Delme-Radcliffe to the effect that a heavy bombardmentby the enemy commenced at 2 am. on the 2-i-th instant. shortly afterwards the weather broke; after which only desultory firing tookplace. No infantry attack is reported by the Italians, but one is mentioned in the German Wireless message.7. With reference to War Cabinet 256, Minute 6, the deputy first Sea Lord stated that the &quot; C. 32 &quot; was aground in Kano Sound(Gulf of Riga), and the crew had failed to get her off. The latter had now disembarked and had been landed at Pernau.British submarines in the Baltic.Convoys.Submarines.8. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that the convoys andescorts were at present held up on account of bad weather.9. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that a destroyer had dropped a depth charge on a submarine in the vicinity of theSkerries ; the result was unknown.Holland:Transport of Sandand Metals.10. Lord Robert Cecil brought to the notice of the War Cabinetthe situation in Holland as regards the question of the transport ofsand and metals from Holland into Belgium, and stated that atpresent a deadlock had been arrived at, but that, though the stateof affairs was somewhat acute, he did not see how we could give way ; moreover, we had every international right to stop the Dutchfrom having the use of our cables, which action was having a veryserious effect on the commercial business of their country. he anticipated that trouble wras bound to occur with the scandinavian countries from the efforts which we were making, in conjunctionwith the United States, to stop the trade of such countries withGermany. He proposed to endeavour to separate the metal con-troversy from that relating to sand. As regards the latter, it had adirect bearing on the military situation, inasmuch as the presentmethod of supply saved the German railways, thus releasing themfor war operations.As regards metals, there were two aspects in the case. one was that the Dutch Government were ready to stop the transit of allmetals via the Dutch canals, provided such metals were requisitionedby the German Government. The other aspect was, the Dutchcontended that when the Germans have sent ore into Holland to besmelted it was not right for us to insist that it should not here-exported for German use.The War Cabinet took note of Lord Robert Cecil&apos;s statement.Potatoes.11. The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that the questionof the retail price of potatoes had been raised in the House ofCommons in connection with the guaranteed price, namely, 6Lper ton.Lord Rhondda stated that a guarantee had been made to that effect early in the year, with the result that about 200,000 moreacres of potatoes had been cultivated this year than last, involving a present surplus of about 2,000,000 tons of potatoes. It would notbe possible to export this surplus, as France and Italy also had a surplus of potatoes. If any growers were allowed to sell under the guaranteed price others would look upon it as a breach of faith onthe part of the Government, their market being spoilt. TheGovernment had not contracted to buy from the growers. certain suggestions had been put forward to him, namely, that we should
get the United States and Belgian troops to take some of thesurplus; and, furthermore, that 5 percent, of the ingredients usedin the making of bread might be potatoes. This only dealt withthe fringe of the question. Another proposal was to substitute forthe original guarantee per ton a subsidy to the farmers for the acreage grown, paying such subsidy direct to the farmer.&apos; Thiswordd result in a cost to the Crown, if the bonus was at the rateof (iZ. an acre, of 9,000,000/. Such procedure would enable themarket price of potatoes to find its own level. Lord Rhonddathought that no further encouragement was needed to inducegrowers to produce potatoes in 1918.Mr. Wintour stated that he did not consider that consumption would be increased even if the retail price were reduced, but that itAvas a question of how to keep the market price up. He reeom-mended buying forward to absorb the surplus, or perhaps a littlemore, and also giving a rebate to the bakers as an encouragement to them to use more potatoes in bread. He strongly advocated,with regard to the remaining surplus, that food-preserving plantshould be developed as rapidly as possible, with a view to dryingthe potatoes and working them off at a later date, either asvegetables or in lieu of flour or alcohol made from grain. As itwould not be necessary or desirable to take delivery of the wholesurplus at the present moment, he would suggest that a slightly higher price should be offered for the delivery of surplus potatoes inthe early part of next year, so as to cover the cost of storage anddeterioration. He added that at the present moment, in liverpool and London, for instance, there was an actual shortage of potatoes,and that farmers were using their labour for other purposes, while there was a large glut of potatoes in the rural districts.During the course of the discussion it appeared that the 61.guarantee came into operation from the 15th September last, andthat a price of 6L per ton to the grower enabled potatoes to beretailed at about, let. a lb. Any grower who sold under 61.was liable to be prosecuted, though sales were taking place inIreland as low as 31. 15s. per ton. The Chief Secretary for ireland was anxious that prosecutions should not be taken up in these cases.In view of the necessity to encourage the people to eat potatoesin order to save flour, and the necessity for conserving all possibleforms of food for next spring, the War Cabinet requested  The Food Controller to prepare for them, at an early date,statements showing what would be the charge to theExchequer if potatoes were retailed at -fd. per lb., taking into consideration the fact that three or four months had elapsed since this season&apos;s potatoes began to be available,and setting out the alternative proposals for the entry of theGovernment as a buyer into the potato market, or for legislation on the lines of the Corn Production Act for compensating potato growers according to acreage.The War Cabinet also sanctioned the use of part of the bread subsidy for the purpose of encouraging the increase of theuse of potatoes in bread.12. With reference to War Cabinet 245, Minute 18, theSecretary mentioned that he was being pressed by the &apos; ForeignOffice to bring forward the question of Zionism, an early settlementof which was regarded as of great importance.Lord Curzon stated that he had a Memorandum on the subject in course of preparation.The question was adjourned until Monday, 29th October, or some other day early next week.2.
