WITH reference to War Cabinet 228, Minute 22, the WarCabinet were informed that it was not the present view of the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff that the Germans might not reachPetrograd during this winter.The War Cabinet approved the deletion of the following words from Minute 22 of War Cabinet 228: &quot;having beeninformed by their Military Advisers that a german advance to Petrograd this year was highly improbable.&quot;Supplies for Eussia.2. The War Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to assistance to Russia : . Telegram from Mr.  Young,  Archangel,  No.   31,   dated september 3, 1917 (G.T.-1946).
2Telegram  from Senior Naval  Officer,  Archangel,   dated september 5, 1917 (G.T.-1953).Despatch from Brigadier-General Knox, dated August 10,1917 (G.T.-1917).These documents raised the question whether any availabletonnage assigned to Russia should be allocated to munitions ofwar or to food. It was pointed out that the allocation of tonnage to certain specific purposes was in the nature of a bargain betweenthe respective Governments, and should not be changed without reference to the Russian Government.The War Cabinet decided to ask Lord Milner to examine thequestion that afternoon in consultation with General- Knox and representatives of the Ministries of shipping and Munitions, and to report to the War Cabinet onMonday next, the 10th September.Naval Guns for 3. In continuation of War Cabinet 228, Minute 21, Major-Russia. General Furse informed the War Cabinet that he had conferred with the Ministry of Munitions and the Admiralty, and theconclusion had been reached that though use could be made ofthese 14-inch guns, and that consequently it was desirable toretain them their value was not of an immediate nature, and ^twas not recommended that we should bargain for their retentionby the offer of heavy guns or howitzers of our own approvedpatterns.The six Russian guns were of a different design to the other14-inch guns in this country. Their chambers would have to be altered, and they had a short life. Moreover, owing to the methodof their manufacture, they would have to be rebuilt entirely overa new &quot;A&quot; tube after firing the allotted number of rounds, insteadof only being re-lined.As regards mountings for the Russian guns, enquiries werebeing made, but it was probable that it would take as long to alteran existing mounting as to make new ones.Major-General Furse remarked that he hoped the cabinet would approve the Army -taking over ten 14-inch guns that werebeing made by Armstrong for Chili, which the Admiralty had stated they would not require. Two mountings were already)&apos;&apos;under construction for two 14-inch guns obtained from theJapanese, and he hoped they would be ready by next December.If the Chilian guns were allocated to the Army, two moremountings could be ordered and should be ready for deliveryby next spring. These four mountings would be sufficient for the12 guns (including two 14-inch guns obtained from the Japanese),and would admit of the four units thus provided being maintained in action with the requisite allowance of spare guns.The Director of Military Intelligence reminded  the WarCabinet that they had decided that eight 6-inch howitzers wereto be sent to Russia..  He stated that the howitzers were now beingpacked, and enquired whether, in view of the altered conditions,it was still desired that they should be sent.The War Cabinet were of opinion thati The supply of these guns was part of the general question asto whether we were to continue to support Russia in view- of the lack of discipline that prevailed in the Army ofthat country and the serious economic situation there(see Minute 13), and decided to defer further considera-tion of the supply until they had received Lord Milner&apos;sreport on Monday next, the  10th September, when adecision would be given both as to the Russian andChilian 14-inch guns.   In the meantime no fresh ship-ments of munitions to Russia should be made.
Proposed 4. With reference to War Cabinet 228, Minute 13, the war conference in Cabinet, in view of the opinions expressed therein, authorised the september. Acting Secretary  of   State  for  Foreign Affairs to inform theGovernments concerned that the British Government concurred inthe postponement of the Conference.Italian Front. 5. The D.M.I. informed the War Cabinet that the Italianoffensive was proceeding with success, and that they had reachedthe summit and western and south-western part of Monte SanGabriele and had taken 600 prisoners.On the Carso front the Austrians had carried out two heavycounter-attacks, and it was possible that the Italians, who wereexposed to a very heavy bombardment, might have to effect aretirement on a portion of the western slopes of the Hermada.Russian Front. 6. The D.M.I. stated that the Russian retreat on the Rigafront continued and that the Germans were now 50 miles east of Riga. The latter had been reinforced by three, and probablyfive, divisions withdrawn from other sections of the EasternGerman front, which indicated that they intended to continue the advance.Russia :Destruction ofAmmunitionDepots.7. The D.M.I. reported that he had ^received information,which originated from the French Military Attache at Petrograd,that there had been of late heavy explosions in several of theRussian ammunition depots in the rear, and that KazanDepot, one of the most important in Russia, had been blown up,with heavy loss of material.The War Cabinet requested the Director of military intelligence to ascertain from the British military attache in Russia full particulars of the losses and, ifpossible, the circumstances under which they took place.East Africa. 8. The   Director   of   Military   Intelligence   reported   twosuccesses in East Africa. It was stated that operations would be restricted next November, when the rainy seasoncommenced.9. The First Sea Lord reported that a convoy of twenty-seven ships had been attacked in the western part of the english channel and that two ships had been torpedoed, but that one (anoiler) had been towed into port, the other sunk. It appearedprobable that the submarine had &quot; browned &quot; the convoy, as theships hit were in the middle of the same.The First Sea Lord added that there were at present 224 ships at sea. under convoy, excluding two convoys as to which thenumbers comprised in the same were not yet known, but probablyconsisted of about eighteen ships in each.Norway. 10. In regard to the position of Norway (War Cabinet 227,Minute 3), the War Cabinet considered telegrams Nos. 3529 to sir c. Spring-Rice and 596 from Sir M. Findlay (see Appendix), moreparticularly with reference to Sir M. Findlay&apos;s enquiry whether he was to alter the policy which he had previously been instructedto pursue.    In this connection the First Sea Lord explained that
the apparent discrepancy in the two opinions of the Naval Staffquoted in Sir M. Findlay&apos;s telegram was caused by the alteredconditions due to the lapse of time, the progress of enemy sub-marine warfare, and the increased demands on our navalresources due to the necessity for starting the system of convoythrough the submarine zone. For instance, at the time that itwas considered that some advantage might be derived from the entry of Norway into the war it was anticipated that a destroyer flotilla which it was intended to base on the Humber would be&quot;available for Norway. This flotilla had now, however, been taken for convoy work.The entry of Norway into the war on the side of the allies would necessitate the appropriation of tonnage to maintain british forces at oversea bases in Norway, and the diversion of numbersof small craft now engaged in convoy work or in protecting thewestern trade routes against submarine attack to norwegian waters to protect the occupied bases.Should United States battleships or cruisers be stationed atNorwegian bases, a number of United States destroyers now engaged in protecting British trade on the western trade routeswould have to be withdrawn to co-operate with the larger vessels in Norwegian waters; this would result in less protection andheavier losses of tonnage on the western trade routes. The UnitedStates naval forces in Norwegian bases would require food, stores,t&amp;c, from the United States and coal from Great Britain, necessi-fcating further withdrawal of tonnage and more Allied lines ofcommunication requiring protection from us. These causes would seriously affect the import of munitions and other supplies to theUnited Kingdom and France and the transport of troops from theUnited States to France. The First Sea Lord admitted, however,that we should be in a better position to help Norway in the spring, and that there might then be an advantage in her joiningus.It was strongly urged that it would be most un-fortunate if Sir M. Findlay were now to be obliged togive replies to enquiries from the Norwegian Governmentwhich would practically amount to informing them that wecould not help them and that they should make the best termsthey could with Germany. It was worth while running a risk,which was not very great, in view of Germany&apos;s evident reluctance to force the issue, and only temporary, inasmuch as Norway&apos;intention might be distinctly advantageous at a later stage, ratherthan compel Norway to throw herself entirely into Germany&apos;sarms.The War Cabinet requested the Acting Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to explain to Sir M. Findlay the changein circumstances wdiich, for the time being, madeNorway&apos;s entry in the war undesirable from the navalpoint of view, but to instruct him, without activelyencouraging the Norwegian Government to go to war,not to discourage them if any question arose of theirstanding firm against German pressure.Proposed military mission to theSerbian Army.11. With reference to War Cabinet 228, Minute 20, theattention of the War Cabinet was drawn to the importance whichthe Serbian Government would attach to the status of the officersappointed at Serbian Headquarters as being, not merely a liaison officer with the British Force at Salonica, but a direct representa-tive of the British Army with the Serbian Army as the army ofan independent Allied country.
12. With reference to the proposed transfer of the SerbianVolunteer Corps in Russia to the Salonica front, the Director of&apos; Military Intelligence explained that of a total of some 16,000 men,3,100 were to have reached Archangel on the 5th September in readiness for embarkation on the 9th for Cherbourg, and thenceby rail to Taranto. The remaining 13,000 were apparently being diverted to the Roumanian front, though General Barter reportedthey might reach Archangel by the 1st November.The Admiralty were in a position to take the men between the29th September and the close of navigation, but the 1st Novemberwould be too late.The War Cabinet instructed The Acting: Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to urgeupon the Russian Government the desirability of lettingthe whole of the Serbian Volunteer Corps get awaybefore the close of navigation.The Situation in 13. The War Cabinet invited General Knox, who was present,Russia. to give his impressions of the Russian situation.General Knox referred to his despatch on Supply and Trans-port, dated the 10th August (G.T.-1917), and said that there were three powerful forces tending to drive the Russians to make aseparate peace.The great mass of the soldiers did not want to fight. Theyhad not wanted to fight before the Revolution, but had been forced on by their officers. There had been frequent cases ofindiscipline before the Revolution; now they were quite general.In the second place, workmen were making huge economicdemands on their employers, and British manufacturers wereclosing factories and moving away. It was expected that therewould shortly be a general lock-out. The workmen had probablyenough money to last them for a month ; after that time, therewould be a state of anarchy. The Government had repeatedlypromised to organise a militia or police force in Petrograd and moscow, but nothing had been done.The third force was the confusion on the railways. Therewas an enormous surplus of grain in the Caucasus, but the level at which the price of bread had been fixed was not such as totempt the peasants to part with their grain. Nor would cashpurchases at high prices attract them. They preferred to bartergrain for goods -which they actually wanted, such as agricultural implements and calico.Force would have to be applied if the grain was to be forth-coming. The harvest in the Volga governments had been a failure, and to bring the grain from the Northern Caucasus and western Siberia was very difficult owing to the condition of rolling stock. In June 1916, 18 per cent, of the engines were under repair; in June 1917, 24 per cent.; and the number was increasing at the rate of 2 per cent, per week. The average number of days per month worked in some of the repairing shopswas only 13&apos;. Thousands of the workmen wrere constantlyattending meetings. The American Railway Mission had notbeen successful, chiefly because it failed to realise the necessity of transfer ofSerbians fromRussia.The Director of Military Intelligence explained that theChief of the Imperial General Staff had the point in mind, andwas contemplating the appointment of an officer of suitableseniority who should occupy the position indicated, and who wouldbe distinct from the officer responsible for the ordinary liaisonwork between the Serbian and British Armies at Salonica.
caking the initiative in dealing with Orientals. The Russiansmust be ordered what to do. Just as the scarcity of bread follow-ing on the railway crisis had produced the Revolution, so the sameforces might lead the people to clamour for a separate peace.In reply to questions as to the likelihood of a coup d&apos;etatfheaded by General Korniloff, General Ivnox said that he did not know what preparations were being made. When he left Russia,on the 18th August, Korniloff and Savinkoff were in agreement.Korniloff was a strong character, an honest patriot, and the bestman in sight. He had the support of the Cossacks. Theynumbered 1,000 squadrons of 150 each. He (General Knox) hadno faith in Kerenski, and had heard rumours that Kerenski&apos;party had accepted money from Germany. Kerenski was afraid of shedding blood and was allowing matters to drift towardsanarchy. A force of 10,000 loyalists would be enough to subduePetrograd the main source of disorder for the Russians werecowards. If Kerenski were to suggest a separate peace he wouldcertainly have the great majority of the country with him. As tosome of the prominent generals in Russia, Alexeieff was a studentof war and not suited to a crisis; Brusiiofi was a politician;Kalevin, the commander of the 8th Army, was one of the bestgenerals and had been chosen by the Cossacks of the Don as their chief. The 12th Army, which was now retreating from Riga, wasthe worst army.In concluding his statement, General Knox strongly urged onthe War Cabinet the importance of the Allied Governmentsmaking a joint representation to the Russian Government recom-mending that in view of Russia&apos;s desperate situation and the perilof putting back democracy, General Korniloff should be fully supported in the measures which he wished to take to restorediscipline at the front, on the railways, and in Petrograd.General Macdonogh called the attention of the War Cabinetto the Identic Note, dated the 31st August, which had been received through Sir G. Barclay, urging that efforts should be made to save the Roumanian Army in Moldavia, and to the importance from this standpoint of restoring discipline in Russia. TheCommittees in Odessa and Jassy were having a very bad effect onthe moral of the troops.The War Cabinet gave careful and prolonged considerationto the above representations and discussed the following proposals:-- r1. To invite the Allied Governments to send a Joint Note tothe Russian Government.2. To invite President Wilson to urge the Russian Govern-ment to support General Korniloff&apos;s programme&apos; adraft of the message to President Wilson to be sent tothe Prime Minister forthwith.3. To send a draft of the proposed Note to Sir GeorgeBuchanan, in order to obtain his view of the advisability-bility of presenting it to the Russian Government.At the request of the War Cabinet, Lord R. Cecil submitted a draft of a Note which might be sent to President Wilson. TheWar Cabinet recognised that the sending of a Note in the termscontemplated was a matter of grave importance, and might be strongly resented by Kerenski and the Government. Interferencemight be construed as helping Korniloff to a coup d&apos; etat. On theother hand, the serious menace of the situation had to be facedand some risk taken. In some ways the position of the Army wasiess menacing than that of the civilian population, which would bepossibly faced with starvation a month or two hence.General Knox emphasised the desirability of a joint repre-sentation by the Western Allies as likely to carry much greaterweight in Russia than one from the United States alone.
Publication of Air 14. With reference to War  Cabinet 228,  Minute 9, thePaid Casualties. War Cabinet was informed that the Home Secretary had expressed his opinion that, in reporting casualties due to air raids, the totals of casualties should be reported,inclusive of, but without specific reference to, those from the navy and Army.The War Cabinet concurred in this opinion, and requested that instructions should be given to the Press Bureau to prohibit publication of reports of coroners&apos; inquests on naval and military casualties.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,7th September, 1917.Lord Robert Cecil considered that it was unlikely that thePresident of a Republican Government would be willing to suggest to the Russian Government what would, in effect, be the establish-ment of a Military Dictatorship. In any case, it was probablethat the United States would prefer that any Note they sentshould go independently.The War Cabinet decided to adjourn the discussion in orderto have an opportunity of reading the Prime Ministers speech which he was delivering at Birkenhead to-day, and which it was understood dealt -with Russia.
APPENDIX.Paraphrase of Extract from. Telegram from Foreign Office to Sir Cecil Spring-Rice.September 3, 1917. *&quot; . . . . RECENT discussions by a War Cabinet Committee have takenplace as to steps to be taken should Norway be brought into the war. In case theAmerican Government take a strong line on the question of exports to germany from Norway, or if the German demands on Norway were such as Norway could not meet, Norway might be forced to join the Allies. The Staff at the Admiraltyrecognise disadvantages which may follow from such a situation, but plans have-been made to meet such an eventuality, and the Naval Staff are anxious to know what co-operation naval authorities of United States would be prepared togive.....&quot;Paraphrase of Telegram from Sir M. Findlay (Christiania), September 4, 1917.WITH reference to your telegram No. 3529 to Sir C. Spring-Rice, assuming that it has been correctly transmitted, I am much puzzled by the statement that theBritish Naval Staff recognise disadvantage of Norway entering the war. this seems to be in conflict with Admiralty opinion in your telegram No. 2781 which stated that they &quot; no longer view with anxiety or indeed with disfavour &quot; the entrance of Norway into the war on the Allies&apos; side. I was then told to keep this inmind as His Majesty&apos;s Government would shape their policy according to theAdmiralty view. Compare also telegram No. 3889, where I am warned that it wasnecessary to treat Norway leniently because of the possibility that she might be involved in the war. These instructions I have acted upon and my views as toalleged danger of German attack have been reported to you in, amongst others, mytelegrams Nos. 4599 and 5092 of to-day. Latter telegram was read to my Americancolleague and he expressed his entire concurrence. My colleague had just seenMinister of Foreign Affairs, who, when pressed as to whether he really believed inalleged danger of attack, could only say that he was not sure. The AmericanMinister is sending a telegram to his Government on the lines of mine to you. he also agreed that if Norwegians were attacked the strategical advantage would be with us. The point is a very important one and I would beg for instructions as,though I foresee some disadvantage, it is not easy to see how an event which wouldgive us bases on the coast of Norway, and would facilitate measures against german trade and submarines can, all things considered, be an advantage to Germany anda disadvantage to us. Germany&apos;s present attitude to Norway suggests she is afraid of Norway joining the Allies and this impression is shared by the Norwegian naval authorities.o
