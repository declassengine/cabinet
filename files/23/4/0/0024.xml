THE   Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported theEnemy&apos;s Supplies.     receipt of a satisfactory message from General Maude to the effectthat he had been closely watching the formation of enemy supplydepots, but had not found any of importance.    Two capturedTurkish officers had stated that the main depots were at Jerablus.[1365-250] B
Eelease of Guns for 2. With reference to War Cabinet 246, Minute 15, the Chief ofDefence^fToMon tlie ImPerial General Staff reported that there was a shortage of40 anti-aircraft. guns for the defence of London. The Navy weresupplying 16 guns, which would shortly be in position, and a further22 were going to be supplied from the Fleet. These 22, however,were being used to replace worn-out guns, and therefore there would, j ; remain a. deficit of 24. &apos; &apos;  - 1    ;   :Attention was called to telegram No. 14 from Mr. Vicars, ati&apos;&apos;       &apos; . -       :   Lyons, to the effect that aerial enterprise on a large scale again t: \ &apos;- &apos; England was contemplated by the enemy at an early date.The First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out that the Navy, whohad been asked to supply 40 guns, had already supplied the 38referred to above, as well as 4 for Chatham.   It therefore -appeared. that what was required from the Admiralty was not 40, but 60.The War Cabinet asked The First Lord of the Admiralty to go into the question again and see if auy more guns could be spared by the Navy for-        the defence of London.        &apos;Air raids : 3. With reference to War Cabinet 245, Minute 13, the WarProvision of Cover Cabinet had before them the Report of the Committee on provision in London. of Cover in London, of which Sir George Cave was Chairman(Appendix).The- War Cabinet agreed with the view of the Committee-i; that the shelter already provided, as shown by the - statement annexed to the Report, did not provide sufficiently for the protec-tion of the working classes in the London area. The provision of, shelter in the West End, on the other-hand, appeared to be ample.It wras most essential to avoid any suggestion that the West End wasamply protected while the working-class districts, such as Leyton&apos; &apos; and Leytonstone, were not: It was generally agreed that existing1; ; arrangements for protection should be developed to the-utmostextent, such as the utilisation of unoccupied houses, which could betaken over, strengthened, if necessary, and marked with a sign &quot; Air-Raid Shelter.&quot; &apos; -&apos; &quot;, &apos; &apos;Sir George Cave said that an Advisory Board of six surveyorswas about to be appointed, who would advise -the Commissioner asto the sufficiency of the shelter provided in the London district and as to - the.. measures to be taken for improving the present arrangements. It&apos; was suggested that the Board should include some officers of the Royal Engineers with experience of bomb-proofshelters at the front, and of the depth required for adequate sub-terranean cover.The War Cabinet decided that         .       ;   , ;(a.) Recommendations (1) and (2) of the Report of Sir GeorgeCave&apos;s Committee should be adopted, viz. : -(1.) That the Commissioner of Police do proceedwith his arrangements for providing shelter.(2.) That a Regulation be made under the Defenceof the Realm Acts empowering the competent authority to require any premises to bemade available as shelter, in case of raids,&apos;    - and suitable notices to be exhibited.At Hit there was only a small reserve for the late Turkish force atRamadie. In general there appeared to be no large supply-arrange-ments yet made. General Maude further reported that desertion was still rife in the Turkish ranks, and many&quot;deserters gave shortage of rations as a pretext for desertion, especially on the Tigris Front.The 1917 harvest was distinctly bare in the Mosul area, andlocal supplies on the Euphrates above Hit and Mosul were scanty.
Proposed Message .    ,.-4, A suggestion, was made that a message of congratulationof. Congratulation .   should be sent, on behalf of the War Cabinet, to Field-Marshalto Sir Douglas      .   gjr Douglas Haig on his continuous, persistent, and dogged advanceai &apos;        &quot; ,  . ,    of 4^- miles in conditions of great difficulty.;.Some discussion took place as to the date on which the message- -       ,..    should be sent whether immediately or after Sir Douglas Haigs&quot;  :-     next successfid advance.The War Cabinet decided that A message of congratulation should be sent immediately, andthe Secretary of State for War was asked to draft atelegram On&apos; the subject, the draft to be shown to thePrime Minister.Parliamentary vote of Thanks toSailors, Soldiers,   1an&apos;d- Men of the mercantile Marine.5. The War Cabinet decided in principle to ask both houses of Parliament to pass a Vote of Thanks to the men of the Navy, theArmy, and the Mercantile Marine.Some discussion took place as to the date on which the Vote of thanks should be moved e.g., on the anniversary of the first battle of Ypres ; simultaneously with a similar vote in the French Chamberon the 1st November ; on the date on which1 the decoration for thosewho landed in&apos; France in the early part of the avar will be issued,viz., the 23rd November ; or oh the same day as the Vote of Credit.No decision was taken as;    undertook to draft theinto the&apos; precedents.to the date, but the Prime Ministerterms of the motion after enqvurySubmarines. 6. The First Sea Lord reported   that the armed boarding-r steamer &quot;City of Belfast&quot; had been in action with an enemy sub-marine Avhile on patrol off Cape de Sata, at 5 a.m. on the lothOctober. The &quot; City of Belfast &quot; had three killed and two avoundedby gunfire, and the ship was holed&quot; near the water line. Oil andwreckage avas observed in the vicinity of the action, and it wasconsidered that the - submarine was probably sunk or badly damaged. The First Sea Lord reported that on the 14th October: a seaplane passed oa^er a.submarine, Avith periscope awash, in the: act of submerging, about. 15 miles south-west of the Longships.The seaplane dropped four 100-lb. bombs ; one fell 20 yards on thestarboard side of the periscope, one 5 yards to port and forward,and one 15 yards off the port boAv.Bombing raids .7. The First Sea Lord reported that a bombing raid wascarried out on the night of the 14th-15th October on Bruges Docks.Four machines dropped 40 112 and 6 250 lb. bombs in thevicinity of the East and West Bassins and Bassin du Commerce.All bombs avere seen to explode. - Results could not be seen owingto intense searchlights and anti-aircraft activity.During the afternoon of the 15th October :a bombing raid wascarried out on Varssenaere Aerodrome. 14 65, 2 50, 60 16, and(fe.) The Advisory Board of Surveyors and Engineers, as sug-gested, should proceed with their work of investigation.(c.) The Committee should reassemble to consider, in consulta-tion with experts, including experienced militaryengineers, the provision of cover on an extensive scale.They should also examine the question of increasingthe means of protection in existing premises, and theacquisition of empty houses with a view to their1adaptation as air raid shelters.&quot;
1-10 lb..bombs were dropped. Some of the sheds on the east sideof aerodrome are reported to have been hit. 7 16 lb. bombs were also dropped on Houttave Aerodrome. &apos;Japanese Military 8. With reference to War Cabinet 242, Minute 13, Mr. BalfourCo-operation. gaid that; as arrang-e(j on the 11th October, he and Lord Curzon andGeneral Smuts had discussed the qupstion of Japanese co-operationwith M. Painleve and M. Franklin-Bouillon. This committee had come to the following main conclusions : (1.) That Japanese co-operation on the French front would beinvaluable, but this was practically precluded by thedifficulty of finding the necessary shipping.(2.) The same difficulties existed to a very slightly less extent in the case of the Salonica front, which was, moreover,&apos; unlikely to offer an opportunity for such striking orfar-reaching action as would make it likely that theJapanese would care to send their troops there.(3.)&apos; The shipping difficulty was much less serious with regardto the Palestine front, but it was generally felt that theeffect of the reconquest of Palestine, and more particu-larly of Jerusalem, would be marred by its being carriedout by Japanese troops.(4.) Mesopotamia. This was the most convenient front for theemployment of a Japanese force, if it should become evident that the Turks and Germans meant to concentratea very large army. For the, present, however, itappeared that our forces were sufficient for the defensive,while an offensive from Baghdad, e.g., towards Aleppo,would be very difficult.(5.) From the shipping point of view, the Russian front wasthe easiest, but in the present confusion in Russia itwas not easy to see how a Japanese force could be gotthrough to the front, or supplied there; while on so large a front a relatively small body, say 200,000 men atthe most, might very well fail to get placed on the decisive sector. The Japanese were known to be reluctant to go to Russia, and the Committee had infact not gone into the question.Beyond these conclusions, the Committee had agreed that atelegram should be sent to the United States asking if they would approve of Japanese military co-operation being invited, and this had been acted on. The question of the effect that Japaneseco-operation might have upon the position in India or the dominions had not been discussed by the Committee, in view of the presenceof the French representatives.The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointed out that, as faras the Dominions were concerned, there could be no difficulty asregards the actual co-operation of the Japanese, but only as regardsthe quid pro quo they might ask for at the end of the War. Hereminded the War Cabinet that the matter had been discussed morethan once at the Imperial War Conference, and that, while theDominion representatives had shown themselves willing to acceptthe Japanese demands with regard to Shantung and the islands inthe Northern Pacific, there was a very general feeling expressedeven more strongly by Sir R. Borden than the other representatives against any arrangement which would involve Japaneseaggrandisement.The Secretary of State for India explained that, in the view ofthe India Office, the tendency in Japan to regard herself as thefuture protector of Asia against Europe was one which was growing,and might be stimulated by Japanese military intervention.   He
Japanese Naval 9  With reference to War Cabinet 235, Minute 10, the FirstCo-operation. Lord of the Admiralty, referring to the refusal of the Japanese tosell two battle cruisers to this country, suggested that it might bepossible to induce them to send two fully-equipped cruisers to join the Grand Fleet in British waters.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should raise thisquestion with the Japanese Ambassador.Appointment of a&quot;Canadian HighCommissioner in washington.10. The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the WarCabinet that he had been that morning shown a telegram by theCanadian High Commissioner, Sir G. Perley, in which Sir R, Bordensaid that, in- view of the difficulty of getting Canadian businessquestions attended to in Washington owing to the number ofrepresentatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government, he had appointedMr. Hazen as Canadian High Commissioner in Washington. TheSecretary of State for the Colonies pointed out that when Sir R.Borden was over here at the Imperial War Cabinet he more &quot;than once insisted that, unless a Canadian representative of somestanding were appointed to the British Embassy in Washington,,he would be obliged to take some such step as he had now in facttaken.Mr. Balfour explained that no action had been taken uponSir R. Borden&apos;s suggestion because he was informed, when he was over in Washington, by His Majesty&apos;s representatives that theCanadian work was better done by visits from Canadian Ministers,such as Sir G. Foster or Sir T. White, than by the appointment ofa special Canadian agent.It was  generally  felt  by the  War  Cabinet  that  it was.agreed, however, that if there were urgent military reasons for suchintervention, political arguments should not count against them.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff considered that it was most desirable to get military assistance from Japan in so far as shipping conditions made it possible. From that point of view it wouldbe desirable to send them by the Trans-Siberian Railway, if the americans were able to get it into order by the spring, though it wasnot absolutely necessary, in that case, for them to be sent to theRussian Western front, as they might co-operate with us on the caucasian front. As regards Mesopotamia, he at present thoughtit improbable that we should require their assistance before theautumn of next year. In any case the arrangements for sending an expeditionary force would take some time to make, and he considered that we should at once take up the matter with Japan,and that the question whether the troops should then be used on one of the Russian fronts or in Mesopotamia could be decidedlater.It was generally agreed that the shipping question was thechief limiting factor, and that it was necessary to ascertain how much shipping the Japanese could themselves divert from theirexisting commercial services for the transport of their troops. Asregards the claims for compensation they might raise afterwards,they would make these in any case, and would, as far as that went,be in a stronger position to press them, if they kept all their troopsin reserve, than if they had made a real effort in the war.The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should, on ascer-taining from the United States that they had no objectionto Japanese assistance, raise the question with the japanese ambassador.
unfortunate that a Canadian High Commissioner, even if: his functions were purely concerned with commercial and financial matters, should be appointed in Washington without being attached in any way to His Majesty&apos;s Embassy.The Secretary of State for the Colonies undertook to sencl atelegram to Sir R. Borden, suggesting, in reference to their previous conversations, that it would avoid possible con-fusion and strengthen the position of the new CanadianHigh Commissioner in Washington if he were attached tothe British Embassy, it being clearly understood that,with regard to his Canadian business, he should receivehis instructions purely from Ottawa.EritishEepresentative inthe United Statesof America:Locwrn-tenensduring the absenceof Lord Northcliffe.11. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that he hadreceived a telegram from Lord Northcliffe saying that he wishedto come back on a visit, and suggesting that his brother, LordRothermere, or Sir F. Black, might take his place during his absence.The War Cabinet generally felt that Sir F. Black was hardlyof sufficient calibre to take Lord Northcliffe&apos;s place, and that, althoughLord Rothermere might be very well qualified in every respect, theappointment of a brother of Lord Northcliffe might provoke criticism.The matter was left over for further discussion.-Supplies to the 12. The War Cabinet had before then a note by M. Painleve-Alii63- and M. Clementel handed to the Prime Minister by M. Franklin-Bouillon (Paper G.T.-2294), dealing with the critical position offood supplies in France for the civil and military population, andthe necessity of setting up a Committee immediately to give effectto the following principles : (a.) A programme must be made allotting to each Alliedcountry the quantities of food absolutely necessary tosubsistence. These food supplies will have absolute priority of import.(b.) The organisation entrusted with these imports will have at its disposal the necessary tonnage. France and GreatBritain will, according to their means, each participate in the creation of the necessary fleet.(c.) An equal restriction in consumption.It was explained that the project was one which had been putforward on various occasions by the French, with the view ofpooling British shipping with that of the Allies, or at least securingsome control over the&apos; distribution of our shipping. The schemewhich was now being urged confined representation on theCommittee to the British and French and omitted the Italians.M. Clementel, who had discussed the matter with the PrimeMinister, and also with Lord Milner, said that he found it difficultto fin a any British officer with whom representatives of the FrenchGovernment could discuss the question of supplies as a whole.The War Cabinet were of opinion that the scheme as pro-pounded in M. Franklin-Bouillons note was unacceptable, but thatsome steps were necessary to deal with the difficulties which had arisen. It was suggested that a conference of the Departmentsconcerned might be arranged to meet M. Clementel.Inasmuch as the project was associated with other economicproposals which are being discussed, with M. Clementel, the WarCabinet decided that Sir Albert Stanley should raise the matter again after he had had an opportunity of further discussion with M. Clementel,
Coal Miners&apos; Wage 14. With reference to War Cabinet 246, Minute 24, Sir Albertand Price of Coal. Stanley pointed out that, owing to the variations in the conditionsof different localities, it had been found desirable to depart some-what from the decision of the Cabinet and to increase the price ofcoal by 2s. 6d. per ton, instead of 2s.The War Cabinet confirmed the action taken by the Presidentof the Board of Trade.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,October 16, 1917.Passports to .13. Mr. Barnes stated that he had been approached with aScandinavia. view, to the granting of passports to Mr. C. Hobson, President ofthe International Metal Workers&apos; Federation, and Mr. J. T. Brownlie,of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, who wished to visitScandinavia and other neutral countries with a view to eliciting the goodwill of workmen in those countries on behalf of the cause ofthe Allies.Mr. Balfour thought the matter too important to decide without some enquiry at the Foreign Office.The War Cabinet decided to adjourn the matter until to-morrow.
-&apos; APPENDIX/      . 1Air Raids : Provision ok Cover&apos; in London.Report of the Committee appointed by the War Cabinet (War Cabinet, No. 245,Minute 13) to consider the question of Providing &quot;Cover in London against air raids, such Committee consisting of The Right Hon. Sir George Cave, M.P. (Chairman),The Right Hon. W. HayesrFisher, M:P!, and major-General Sir F. C. Shaw, K.C.B.THE first question which the Committee had to consider.was whether an endeavourshould be made to provide cover for all those inhabitants of London who might not feel safe in their own houses, or only for those who wottld be likely to be in the streetsin the case of a raid. The Committee were all of opinion that it is undesirable toencourage people to leave their houses in order to take shelter elsewhere. A house,however lightly built, forms a good protection against splinters, and the risk of livesbeing lost by enemy bombs is less if the population are scattered in their own homesthan if they are collected together in shelters which cannot be made bomb-proof.Further, if families leave their houses during the raid in order to seek better shelterelsewhere they run a serious risk of being hit in the streets by bombs or splintersfrom our own guns. The Committee therefore came to the conclusion that sheltershould be provided for persons who may be in the open in the case of a raid, and thatthe inhabitants should be discouraged (but not prohibited) from leaving their houses for these shelters.The Commissioner of Police has for some time past been making arrangementsfor utilising all available shelters, and for regulating admission to them. these include railway stations, tunnels and arches, town halls, schools, public libraries adother public buildings, crypts and basement of churches, and many hundreds of privatebuildings such as factories with suitable basements. The annexed return shows thatshelter is already available for about 900,000 people, and additional buildings are beingmade available for the purpose. But there are still many districts, notably in the poorer parts of London, where the available shelter is not yet sufficient; and althoughit is probable that few people would resist an appeal to provide shelter, it is advisable that a regulation should be made under the Defence of the Realm Acts empowerincthe competent authority to require the occupier of any suitable place to throw it openas a shelter in the case of raid&apos;s. &apos; ......It has been arranged that persons wdio are willing to give shelter should, onwarning of a raid being received, exhibit a placard with the words &quot; Air-raid shelter &quot; ;and the use of the shelters will be regulated by the police authority. In the case ofthe Tube stations, where there was some overcrowding on the occasion of the late raidsto.the great inconvenience of bond fide passengers, the railway companies have been recommended to take steps to avoid any such misuse of their stations in the future.With regard to&apos;the suggestion that cover might be arranged by the constructionof dug-outs in the parks, it appears that bomb-proof dug-outs must be 20 feet belowthe ground and require heavy timber and effective drainage. Assuming that 6 square feet per man of floor space is required, about 170 yards of gallery 12 feet broad wouldbe required for every 1,000 people, and about ten entrances would be needed for sucha gallery. This is special work which would have to be performed by tunnelling, orfield companies of the Royal Engineers, or skilled labour of a similar character, and itis doubtful whether either the materials or the labour for carrying out work of thiskind on a large scale would be available. On the other hand, splinter-proof dug outsor shelters would only require 9 inches of earth carried on corrugated iron or plankingwith suitable support, and if built above ground the walls must be of the samethickuess and the entrances and exits must be protected. But this kind of dug-out,though proof against splinters, is not proof against bombs or unexploded shell; and itdoes not afford more protection than an ordinary house. Upon the whole theCommittee doubt whether it is desirable to give effect to this suggestion at the present[time.With regard to the use of sand-bags or cinder-bags, some of these are- in use
already and others are being provided for use in the police stations and elsewhere.The supply of sacking material for these bags is necessarily limited at the presenttime, and it is impossible to provide sand or cinder-bags for any large number ofhouses; but if bags can be procured or improvised they will of course affordadditional protection.No doubt the local authorities will give all the assistance in their power in findingshelter, bags, &amp;c.The Committee therefore recommend 1. That the Commissioner of Police do proceed with his arrangements for providing shelter ;2. That a regulation be made under the Defence of the Realm Acts empowering the competent authority to require any premises to be made available asshelter in case of raids, and suitable notices to be exhibited ;3. That, for the present, dug-outs be not provided in the parks ;4. That all practicable steps be taken to increase the protection afforded by existing shelters.It will be necessary to give publicit3&apos; to the arrangements for shelter whencompleted.Signed on behalf of the Committee :(Signed) GEO.
