The agricultural programme.1, WITH reference to War Cabinet 258, Minutes 1 and 2,Lord Milner informed the War Cabinet that he wished placed on record the situation as regards the agricultural programme. Abouta fortnight ago he had requested that this matter might beconsidered, and it was placed on the agenda of last Friday week,the 26th October, but, owing to other important business, no decision was arrived at. . The position now is that, with great difticidty, wehave stimulated the farmers, who are doing all that is possible withtheir own resources, but labour and a further supply, of petrol arerequired so as to enable thetn to woi-k to the programme authorised by the War Cabinet. As regards the labour question, the army had&quot;sripplied^rnflipr^moro than the numboro laid clown- by the WarCabinet, but only a small proportion of the &quot; skilled &quot; workers were really skilled. Lord Milner did not attach any blame to the armyauthorities, who, on the wdiole, had been very helpful, and he believed that the army at home had furnished very nearly as manyskilled.men as could be found. He had written to Field-marshal sir Douglas Flaig personally urging that, if possible, during thecoming months agricultural furlough might be granted to men inFrance behind the line who were skilled ploughmen. If even a couple of thousand such men could be lent, it would make a great difference. Skilled ploughmen were the great need. At the presentmoment they had, thanks to Lord Goschen, between 2,000 and3,000 ploughs and teams of horses ready, which were asked for by farmers, but no one to work them. In connection with the tractorsituaition, the attention of the War Cabinet had already been drawn to the fact that there was a serious shortage of petrol, and conse-quenfly full use. could not be made of the tractors at the disposal ofthe Government. . .The War Cabinet requested Lord Milner to consult Sir Auckland Geddes as regards thequestion of labour.The Secretary was instructed to arrange that the agricultural programme should be placed on the Agenda during thepresent week.The Invasion ofItaly.2. The Director of Military operations reported that no news had been received from Italy since the previous day.The Western Front. 3. The Director of Military Operations stated that we had attacked Passchendaele this morning and that good progress hadbeen reported ; no rain had fallen during the night.Air Offensive. 4. With reference to War Cabinet 259, Minute 5, the Directorof Military Operations stated that he had received a full report from field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig as to the results of the long-rangebombing of German territory, and would circulate the same for theinformation of the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet requested Sir Edward Carson to exercise his discretion as to the publica-tion or otherwise of the particulars furnished in the report.Bombing of 5. Jn connection with the recent bombing of Antwerp, theAntwerp. Director of Military Operations reported that in August 1916 aa scheme was drawn up for the bombing of the Hoboken NavalWorks at Antwerp, and that the bombing was carried out at thatdate. As regards the recent bombing of that town, Field-marshal sir Douglas Haig  reported that the machines had started for
Mesopotamia. G. The Director of Military Operations stated that the russians have re-occupied Kasri Shirin.Palestine. 7. The Director of Military Operations reported that general allenby&apos;s preparations for his next attack are proceeding satis-factorily.British Submarines S. With reference to War Cabinet 265, Minute 9, the First sea in the Baltic. Lord reported that he was circulating extracts from a report that hehad received from the Commander in charge of the Britishsubmarines in the Baltic, giving an account of the operations carriedout by that flotilla during the recent German offensive, and wasadding some remarks which that officer had made on the discipline and moral of the Russian naval forces. He stated that, withreference to M. Kerensky&apos;s appeal for naval assistance in the Baltic,our Ambassador had been informed that the latest information inthe possession of the Admiralty indicated the fact that the Russianfleet in the Baltic was superior in power to the German fleet operating in those waters.Irish Expenditure. 9. With  reference to War Cabinet 244, Minute 3, the chief secretary for Ireland submitted a request to the War Cabinet that up to a certain limit he should be allowed control of expenditure inIreland upon development and other objects which he was personallysatisfied would conduce to the prosperity and content of the country.Mr. Long pointed out that the only esteem -which the chief secretary got in Ireland from a certain class of the Irish people was &apos;that which was obtained by the expenditure of public money, andthat too rigid Treasury control made it appear to the Irish people that the Chief Secretary was powerless, and that the Treasury wasomnipotent. He strongly advocated that within certain limits thecontrol of public expenditure in Ireland should be centred in theChief Secretary. He expressed the opinion that such a reform would do much to restore the prestige and personal position of the chief secretary.The War Cabinet decided that-Any recommendation of expenditure in Ireland put forward bythe Chief Secretary, up to the limit of 5O,0O0L in eachcase, should be agreed to by the Treasury unless theChancellor of the Exchequer was of opinion that theproposal ought not to be accepted, in which case thematter should be submitted to the Cabinet for decision.Air 10. With reference to War Cabinet 261, Minute 10, and WarRe-organisatiou: Cabinet 2(54, Minute 4, the War Cabinet had before them the draftAir Force Bill. of tQe Air Force Bill (Paper G.T.-2494.)Lord Milner said that, in accordance with the decision of theWar Cabinet the previous day (War Cabinet 265, Minute 13), hehad, in the absence of General Smuts, presided at a meeting of theAir Organisation Committee held the same afternoon. The meeting had been attended by representatives of the Admiralty, the WarOffice, the Air Board, the Treasury, and the Ministry of Munitions,[1365-266] B 2Cologne, but, owing to bad weather, had had to turn back ; oneportion of the squadron bombed .the Hoboken works as that hadbeen an objective in the past, and the remaining machines bombedSt. Denis Westrem. Instructions had now been given that nofurther bombing was to be carried out on Antwerp.
and Mr. Long, the Minister in charge of the Bill, and one of theLaw Officers of the Crown had also been present. The Bill hadbeen carefully examined clause by clause, and certain minor amendments had been suggested and accepted, which would be incorporated in the Bill in the form in which it would be placed before Parliament. Lord Milner said that he was satisfied that thewishes and suggestions of the two. great War Departments chiefly concerned had been fully considered, and that the Bill in its final form would have their approval. In his opinion-the Bill was ripe for presentation to Parliament. Many administrative and otherdetails would, of course, still remain to be worked out. One or two points had engaged the special attention of the Committee. Thefirst referred to Clause 8, Sub-section 2, but this difficulty hadbeen got over. The second point was connected with the questionof the transfer of officers and men from the Royal Naval AirService and the Boyal Flying Corps to the new Air Force, and the fear, that they might be arbitrarily transferred, to their owndetriment. The Bill, however, clearly laid down that no transfercould be carried out without the individuals own consent.In reply to a question, Sir David Henderson pointed out that anofficer or man might voluntarily elect to.be transferred to the AirForce or to be temporarily attached, in which latter case he wouldbe able to return to the Army or Navy after serving with the AirForce for a certain period. He would, in fact, be seconded for thetime.being. .Lord milner , cohtinitihg, said that certain further difficulties inregard to the question of transfer and attachment might arise e.g.,the question of &quot; sea time,&quot; as counting towards promotion to activecommands at sea, and the extent to which a period of service withthe Air Force might involve loss of sea time. Unless such difficulties, could be satisfactorily solved, they might conceivably beprejudicial to the future career of men joining the Air Force, butthey need not be regarded as formidable or insurmountable, as thetwo War Departments had only to meet them in a spirit of equityand, if necessary, to effect some minor alterations in the existing regulations of. the two services.Mr. Long said that at the meeting of the Committee the previous afternoon he had raised the question of pay and allowances, which,he was sure, should be examined in greater detail, with a view to adefinite and just decision, before the Bill was read a second time.Public opinion was much exercised over the matters of sailors&apos; andsoldiers&apos; pay, and Parliament would certainly insist upon being satisfied in this respect. No man should be allowed to suffer inregard to pay and allowances by joining the Air Force. From whatthe Treasury representative had said at the Committee Meeting theday before, he gathered that, while the Exchequer was prepared tomake certain concessions for the period of the War, it would not commit itself to maintaining the same standard of pay and allowanceswhen the War was over and the Air Service would he less dangerous.Mr. Long thought that this point of view would not commend itselfto Parliament. In regard to the point which-had just been raised inthe Cabinet on the subject, Mr. Long said that, although the Billprovided that no man could be compelled to transfer, anyone whowas given die option of transferring would be placed in a difficult position ; even if his transfer involved pecuniary loss he could hardly refuse, as it was common knowledge that thousands of men had thrown up everything in order to join the Forces. .The War Cabinet agreed that no individual should be permitted to suffer by reason of his joining the Air Force, and decided that (a.) The Bill, with the minor alterations agreed upon by theAir Organisation Committee the previous day, should be approved and laid before Parliament ;(b.) Mr. Long should consult with the Government Whips as tothe procedure concerning its introduction ;
(c.) The Chancellor of the Exchequer should consult withMr. Long in respect of the question of pay and allowances of individuals joining the Air Force, thegeneral principle being accepted that no person joining the said force during the war should be permitted to suffer in respect of his pay and allowances.11. The War Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs (Paper G.T.-2412) and a Memorandumby the Ministry of Shipping (Paper G.T.-2493) dealing with thetonnage situation.Mr. Balfour said that, in his opinion, the tonnage situation wasthe most important thing in the war. The war was one ofexhaustion, and there did not seem to be a likelihood of any greatmilitary success. The belligerents were trying to strangle eachother, and our opponents&apos; method of strangulation was to cut off our food supplies by isolating the Allies from their sources of supply.Only recently Rindenburg was reported to have said that the hopeof Germany lay not in their Army but in their submarines. Mr.Balfour said that, this being so, the question of tonnage is themilitary question, compared with which other questions haddiminished in importance.Sir Edward Carson agreed with the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs that the tonnage question was all-important. Theshipping situation might improve slightly from time to time, butthe amount of tonnage was steadily going down and must disappearif the war went on long enough. In his opinion the tonnage problem should not be decided piecemeal, but ought to be considered inconnection with Mr. churchill&apos;s Paper (Paper G.T.-2436), in whicha definite decision as to military policy was requested.Lord Robert Cecil referred to the recent agreement which hadbeen come to with M. Clementel. wdiereby we had agreed that theresponsibility for the food supplies of France and Italy should be acommon charge on all the Allies, including the United States ofAmerica. He considered this agreement was absolutely necessaryin order to keep the Allies in the war. He even thought that therecent failure of the Italians was partly due to their apprehension inregard to their supplies of food and coal, which had provided theGermans with a very fertile soil for their propaganda.It was pointed out that, under this agreement, we had decidedthat the carriage of the food of the Allies, as well as the purchase,should be for joint account.Sir Josejm Maclay said that if no extra assistance had to begiven to the Allies, British imports next year woxdd be less than theimports this year by some 6,000,000 tons, and if the extra demand of the Allies for cereals, amounting to over 2,,000),000 tons, had to fall upon British tonnage, the decrease in British imports must thenexceed 8,000,000 tons, lie asked that a small Committee, with amember of the War Cabinet as Chairman, should be appointed atonce, with instructions to go into the whole matter with a view to seeing how far the requirements of British imports could be cutdown so as to meet the deficit indicated above.In approving this proposal, the War Cabinet were of opinionthat this Committee should be formed of Ministers, and not ofrepresentatives of the Departments. The Committee would make recommendations to the War Cabinet, who, in turn, would decide what cuts were to be made.The War Cabinet decided that-A Committee, composed of :  Lord Milner (in the Chair),,The Minister of Munitions,The Secretary of State for the Colonies,The President of the Board of Trade,The Food Controller, and, The Shipping Controller,
Acceleration ofMerchantShipbuilding.should be appointed to consider to what extent andTn whatdirections imports should be further restricted, and toreport their recommendations to the War Cabinet as soonas possible.12. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the PrimeMinister, before he left for Italy, had referred in conversation to thedisappointing results in regard to the output of new tonnage ascompared with the expectations which had been raised, and statedin the House of Commons. The Prime Minister had been of opinionthat a Committee should be formed, consisting of The Controller of the Admiralty,The Minister of Munitions,The Shipping Controller, andThe Minister of National Service, - &apos;who should examine the whole situation of merchant shipbuilding.Mr. Churchill said that the Ministry of Munitions had recentlyincreased tbe outpruVof. the rolling-mills to a very great extent. Theresults had been moCT^g^fflying. Whereas a short time ago menwere standing idle for want of materials, the output of steel-platesto-day was greater than could be put together, and was even being-stacked. In fact, what had been the limiting factor, namely,capacity of the rolling-mills, had now&apos;*aisappeareovl ^-&quot;^^-^In view of this statement of the Minister of Munitions the WarCabinet felt that, before appointing a Committee, it would be well to ask the Controller of the Admiralty to report fully on the presentposition of merchant shipbuilding, both as regards labour andmaterial, giving an estimate of the amount of shipbuilding duringthe next year.The Secretary was instructed to ask the Controller of theAdmiralty for this information.In this connection Lord Robert Cecil said he thought it wouldbe valuable to have a surveyboth Allies and neutrals.showingthe available shipping ofThe Shipping Controller undertook to circulate to the cabinet a statement on the lines of Lord Robert CeciTs request.ParliamentaryVote of Thanks toSailors, Soldiers,and Men of the mercantile Marine.13. With reference to War Cabinet 250, Minute 10, and war Cabinet 251, Minute 5, Sir Edward Carson, as Minister incharge of Propaganda, asked for a decision of the War Cabinet inregard to the extent to which the Parliamentary Vote of thanks to sailors, soldiers, and men of the mercantile marine should bereproduced and circulated. He represented that 300,000 copieshad already been printed, and that further reproduction wouldinvolve great expense and a heavy consumption of paper. he further informed the War Cabinet that the press were alreadyprotesting in respect of the amount of paper which was being used,for this purpose.The War Cabinet decided that The number of copies must be limited to that already printed,the question of distribution to be left to the discretion ofSir Edward Carson.(Initialled) A.
