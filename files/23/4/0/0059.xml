1. IN reference to War Cabinet 283, Minute 2, the Director ofMilitary Operations reported that between the 20th and 27thNovember our infantry casualties had amounted to 15,953. the cavalry casualties so far reported were very light, but the exacttotals had not been returned to the War Office. The wastage of horses from all causes was under 300. General Maurice estimatedthat the total casualties of all arms for the above period were probably about 18,000.2. The Director of Military Operations stated that general plumer had reported that, in conference with Generals Diaz andFayolle, they had come to the conclusion that it would be imprac-ticable for the British troops to operate in the mountains, owing tothe fact that they were untrained in, and not equipped for, mountainwarfare. It had been decided that the British should take over theMontello section, which was the key to the Piave position, whilst theFrench would take up their position on the Asolo section ; one resultof this would be that the British would be in the line before theFrench.3. The Director of Military OjDerations explained that thesituation in East Africa was now such as to allow a reduction inthe British forces engaged in that theatre. As a result, certaintroops would be withdrawn as soon as possible.The Western Front. 4. In reply to a question as to the situation of our forces in theneighbourhood of Passchendaele, to the effect that our position hadbeen rendered very unfavourable owing to the fact that the germans had withdrawn their long-range heavy guns to such a distance thatthey were placed to shell our front line trenches, the Director ofMilitary Operations stated that the Germans had collected a mass of artillery against this section of our line. He did not consider thatwe were inferior in artillery, except possibly in these long-rangeguns, which were employed usually to shell the area behind thefront line. In his opinion, the position of our front line troops wasuncomfortable, for that line had not yet been fully established, buthe considered that matters were, worse for the Germans, since weheld the high ground. It was possible that our troops might haveto withdraw from one or two of the more exposed posts, but he wasnot afraid of an enemy attack on a large scale, owing to the boggynature of the ground, which in this region never dried up in winter-time. In regard to long-range guns, it was the opinion of theCommauder-in-Chief in France that these weapons were not nearly so efficacious against entrenched troops as howitzers, and it was forthat reason that he had shown a preference for howitzers in hisdemands for artillery.Captures. 5. iu reply to a question, the Director of Military Operationsstated that by the 24th November the total of German prisoners captured in the Cambrai fighting had amounted to 9,874, but 700 or80(1 had since been captured, bringing the total up to about 10,500.Palestine. &apos;6. The Director of Military Operations stated that there was nochange in the situation in Palestine, and that General Allenby wasfacing the enemy while the relief of his divisions was being carriedout and additional artillery was being brought up.Eecent casulties on the western front.The Invasion ofItaly.East Africa.
Submarines. 8. The Deputy First Sea Lord stated that it had been reported from Dunkirk that the transport &quot; Boma&quot; claimed to have sunk aGerman submarine, but that the report was unconfirmed.British Zeppelins. 9. In reference to War Cabinet  283, Minute 7, the deputy first Sea Lord reported the position as to British Zeppelins to be asfollows :  -Completed, four, of which one was fit for training only andthree fit for training and coastal work.The first Zeppelin which may be fit for fleet work would not beready until March 1918.Supplies for 10. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that the Senior NavalArchangel. Officer, Archangel, had telegraphed requesting that 4,000 tons ofstaple supplies might be sent to that port. Lord Milner, with theconcurrence of the Admiralty, had telegraphed for further par-ticulars on this point, and the Senior Naval Officer had explainedthat the stores were required for distribution amongst the Russians.He asked for the decision of the War Cabinet on the two followingpoints : (a.) Whether this relief ship should be despatched.(b.) Whether the Admiralty were to purchase the stores inthe  open market   through   the  Admiralty  ContractDepartment.The War Cabinet decided that The relief ship and stores should not be sent.Guarantee of neutrality ofSwitzerland.11. Lord Robert Cecil reported that he had recently beenvisited by the American Ambassador, who had stated that theAmerican Government desired to give a guarantee to the swiss government that the neutrality of the latter wyould be respected bythe Americans. Lord Robert Cecil did not understand the value ofa guarantee on the part of the Americans alone, but thorrght that aguarantee on the part of the Allies, more particularly the French,might be reassuring to the Swiss. His opinion was that, so far asthe War Cabinet was concerned, there would he no objection to theproposed guarantee being given by the Americans, but thought that,-the matter should be discussed at the Conference in Paris.The War Cabinet decided that The Acting Secretary of - State for Foreign Affairs should referthis matter to Mr. Balfour, with a view to its being brought forward for discussion at the Inter-Allied Conference inParis.Eussia.12. The Director of Military Operations reported that GeneralBarter, the head of the British Mission at Russian headquarters,had enquired what, action he should take in the event of LieutenantKrilenko succeeding in arranging an armistice or peace terms withthe enemy.It was pointed out that if the British Mission were to join theBritish Ambassador in Petrograd it would be going further away[1385-285]B 2Loss of a Seaplane. 7. The Deputy First Sea Lord reported that a seaplane fromPortland had been lost, but that the pilot and passenger had been saved.
from General Kaledin, whom it was desired to encourage, while ifit proceeded to Rbumania it might be out of Russia at the moment when a sudden change might render its presence very desirable. Itwas also pointed out that if the British Mission joined GeneralKaledin, it would amount to a recognition of his party as the existing government of the country. *The Director of Military Operations expressed the opinion thatthere should be uniformity of action by the Allied nations, and thatthe British Mission should carry out the same course as the othermissions in Russia.The War Cabinet decided that The Director of Military Operations should refer the point for decision to the Inter-Allied Conference in Paris, explaining that the War Cabinet had not at its disposal sufficientinformation to enable them to come to a decision.Co-co-ordination committee for labour Disputes.13. With reference to War Cabinet 283, Minute 9, the WarCabinet further considered the Memorandum by Mr. Barnes on thequestion of the co-ordination of Government Departments dealingwith wages and trade disputes (Paper G.T.-2772).Sir Auckland Geddes gave some illustrations of the evil effects of competition for labour among various Government Departmentsengaged on war work, and suggested that a two-tier organisation was necessary to deal with the confusion now prevailing, namely, aCommittee of each trade, composed of representatives of employersand employed, for interior co-ordination, and, above it, a co-co-ordinating committee, which might be formed by the Chairman of such tradecommittees, of which Mr. Barnes should be Chairman, to deal withthe wages question as a whole. The Ministry of National service had at present a Building Trade Committee, composed of menthoroughly familiar with the trade.Mr. Kellaway said that there was a similar Committee attachedto the Ministry of Munitions, but little notice was taken of such committees by the Government Departments. He would view withalarm a Co-ordinating Committee composed of representatives ofemployers and employed. There was a probability they wouldcombine to increase wages.Sir Alan Anderson said it was important to encourage direct negotiation between employers and unions, and gave as an example recent effort in this direction in the shipbuilding trade ; he considered that then direct negotiations could be combined withthe proposed co-ordinating Committee, but agreed that a safeguardwas necessary to guard against the danger of an alliance betweenmasters and workmen to put up wages. This clanger might be averted either by bringing representatives of employers andemployed to the central body or by providing from the central body a chairman for the trade conference.Mr. Wolff pointed out that, since Section 7 of the MunitionsAct had been abolished, the inducement to employers to resistadvance of wages had disappeared, and the Ministry of Munitionswas being overwhelmed with applications for advances, with a viewto the retention of the labour now in their employ.The War Cabinet requested Mr. Barnes, Mr. Roberts, and Sir Auckland Geddes, in consul-tation with the Departments concerned, to prepare a scheme in the light of that day&apos;s discussion, for submission to theCabinet.Legality of CertainActs done underthe Defence of theEealm Regulations.14. With reference to War Cabinet 244, Minute 1, and war Cabinet 247, Minute 6, the War Cabinet had before them thefollowing documents :-
15. The War Cabinet had under consideration a report (paper g.-171) by the Food Controller on Compulsory Rationing and theDistribution of Essential Foods.Lord Rhondda explained that he did not, at this stage, wish theWar Cabinet to commit themselves to the polic3T of compulsoryrationing, but only asked their permission to proceed with theorganisation of the system that would he necessary to carry it out.A. comprehensive system would require four months to develop and get ready for working, as officials would, need to be trained andpremises acquired for the establishment of approximately 10,000local offices. The cost of the organisation would he several hundred thousand pounds, and the food situation might conceivably be suchby next April that it might be possible to avoid rationing, in which case the organisation would be scrapped, unless it could be utilised for some other purpose. He was strongly opposed to rationing if itcould possibly be avoided.   Lord Rhondda added that he hadCompulsoryRationing.(a.) Opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown (Paper G.-165).Further Observations by the Law Officers (Paper G.T.-2651).. (b.) Acquisition of Land: Draft Bill, with Memorandum byLord Derby (Paper G.T.-2153). Note by Mr. Duke(Paper G.T.-2195). Memorandum by Lord Derby (paper g.T.-2749).It was explained that the Defence of the Realm Losses Corn-mission was a body which assessed direct and actual loss for an ex gratia payment. Owing to some doubts expressed in the Courts,especially in the Shoreham Aerodrome case, petitions of right hadbeen presented claiming compensation under the Lands Clauses Actfor property commandeered under the Defence of the realm regulations. The object of the Bill prepared by the Secretary ofState for War was to overcome the difficulty which had thus arisen,and, roughly speaking, give statutory recognition to the principle of assessment adopted by the Losses Commission, where the claimantundertakes to accept an ex. gratia payment, and to pursue no otherremedy.The Solicitor-General said he saw no objection to the adoptionof the principle on which the Losses Commission acted, but theAcquisition of Land Bill required some drafting amendments.The War Cabinet approved the principle of the Bill, and requested the Law Officers to examine the draft in con-sultation with the Lord Chancellor, after which the Secretaryof State for War was authorised to proceed with the Bill.With reference to the Defence of the Realm (Beans, Peasand Pulse Orders) Bill, the Solicitor-General pointed out that therewas nothing in the Bill as drafted to preveut the original consigneegoing to the Losses Commission and asking for compensation. If itwas desired to take away the right to such an appeal, provision should be made in the Bill.Lord Rhondda agreed that the Bill needed re-drafting in that respect and in some others. He explained that some 2,500,00.01. was at stake.Dr. Addison thought the main object of the Bill, viz., to penalisespeculative dealing iu necessities during war-time, was one whichwould meet with wide-spread support in the country and in the Houseof Commons.The War Cabinet approved the principle of the Bill, and requested Lord Rhondda to have it re-drafted, in the lightof the discussion which had taken place, for submission tothe Law Officers.
carefully studied the French system of rationing, and did notconsider it at all satisfactory.Mr. Illingworth stated that he had conferred with Lord Rhondda,and regretted that the organisation of the Post Office would not admit of any duties in connection with a rationing scheme beingadded to the already heavily pressed Post Office arrangements.Moreover, only a small proportion of the post offices were under hisdirect control. The payment of pensions, separation allowances, &amp;c,had so greatly increased the work of the Post Office staffs that any additional duties might easily lead to a breakdown in the postalorganisation.The opinion was expressed that, if the scheme for compulsoryrationing was prepared, it was possible that the rationing of essential foodstuffs would have to be brought into operation.The War Cabinet held the view that, before acceding to thegeneral proposal of the Food Controller, it was desirable that theyshould be furnished with more details as to the manner in whichthe scheme would be carried out, it being admitted that it could notbe worked through the post offices.The &quot;War Cabinet therefore requested The Food Controller to render a report setting out more fully the framework of his proposed system of rationing.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,November 28, 1917.
