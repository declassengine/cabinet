Air said. 1. General Shaw, Chief of the General Staff, Home Forces,gave such details as were available in regard to an air raid whichhad only terminated at seven o&apos;clock that morning.After certain preliminary attacks, probably made by lightaeroplanes with the object of drawing the fire of the defences,several groups had endeavoured to reach London, the majority ofwhich had been turned back. It was estimated, as a rough con-jecture, that some 25 aeroplanes had been employed, of which 5 or6 only reached the heart of London. Two aeroplanes, one of whichwas a &quot;Gotha,&quot; had crashed down one at Canterbury and one on the aerodrome at Rochford and three men had been takenprisoners from each.A number of bombs were dropped, the great majority being ofan incendiary character. Four large fires were caused in Shore-ditch, Whitechapel, and South Lambeth Road. Outside Londonbombs were dropped at Ramsgate, Margate, Deal, Chatham, andSheerness. No considerable damage had as yet been reported.Up to the present only two persons were reported killed in theMetropolitan district, and four at Sheerness. Nine persons had also been wounded at Sheerness.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) In view of the small amount of damage inflicted, no mention should be made in the published commtmiqueof the fact that incendiary bombs were dropped.(b.) An announcement should be made in both Houses ofParliament by Lord Curzon and Mr. Bonar Lawrespectively.AGeneral Smuts undertook to prepare a suitable statement, inconsultation with the Departments concerned.Transfer of Enemy 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported the iden-Divisions. tification, near Cambrai, of another German division withdrawnfrom the Eastern front.The Western Front. 3. With reference to War Cabinet 290, Minute 1, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff reported that the first stage of the re-adjustment of the line in the Cambrai district had been successfullyarrived at. No public announcement had been made, as the enemy had not as yet discovered our withdrawal. Certain movementsstill remained to be carried out.East Africa. 4. With reference to War Cabinet 289, Minute 4, the Chief ofthe Imperial Genera,! Staff conveyed the thanks of General VanDeventer, and the forces with him, for the War Cabinefs con-gratulatory message.5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that theGermans who had escaped to Portuguese territory had met with very feeble resistance, the Portuguese surrendering as soon as theenemy got to close quarters. The enemy captured considerableammunition, and had apparently re-arrned about 300, men withPortuguese rifles.6. With reference to War Cabinet 292, Minute 6, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff quoted a telegram from general plumer, which stated that the attacks on the 3rd December on the20th Corps front were more serious than was at first apparent.The Invasion ofItaly.
The Italians, owing to heavy artillery fire and superior numbers,had had to withdraw from a number of positions, but even if afurther retirement had to be carried out it should be only local,and should not materially affect other sectors of the line. the losses were heavy on both sides.Rumours of EnemyProjects.Salonica:General Sarrail.Archangel.Vladivostock.7. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff called attention tothe prevailing rumours regarding projected attacks by the enemy on many fronts. It was not possible that they could all be true,and some were demonstrably false. For example, it was said thatthe 24th and 32nd Turkish Divisions were on the Italian front,whereas the 24th was fighting in Palestine and the 32nd had beendisbanded.8. With reference to Wrar Cabinet 282, Minute 3, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff again called attention to the inadequacy of our information regarding the Allied situation on the Salonicafront. No action appeared to have been taken by M. Clemenceauto relieve General Sarrail of his command.The Secretary stated that the general position at Salonica hadbeen referred by the Supreme War Council at Paris to the Perma-nent Military Advisers for consideration.The War Cabinet felt that, whether the rumours ofconcentra-tion were true or not, the position was very unsatisfactory, andthat the War Cabinet could not divest itself of responsibility for what might occur.The War Cabinet decided to request: The Chief of the Imperial General Staff to draft a strongly-worded telegram, to be sent in the name of the PrimeMinister to M. clemenceau by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.9. With reference to War Cabinet 290, Minute 5, the First sea lord reported that a message had been received from AdmiralICemp, the Senior Naval Officer at Archangel, stating that an ice-breaker, manned by pro-Germans, was being fitted with 6-inch guns, and it was intended to send her to Archangel, possibly with the object of damaging H.M&apos;.S. &quot; Iphigenia.&quot; AdmiralJeliicoe urged that a definite policy should be adopted inregard to Archangel. There appeared to be advantages to be gained by concentrating all our forces at Murmansk, and there was still time for the remaining ice-breakers to extricate thet; Iphigenia.&quot; The British force at Archangel was not sufficienteither to protect or destroy the stores, and it was impossible tostrengthen them owing to the ice.The War Cabinet decided that A statement of the position as it appeared to the War cabinet should be sent to the Senior Naval Officer and the Consulat Archangel, who should be called upon immediately tomake a joint report; the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the First Sea Lord to concert the necessary action.10. Sir Edward Carson stated that Commander Locker-Lampson had brought to him a project for the occupation of vladivostock-vladivostock and the control of the Siberian Railway.The War Cabinet asked that    -Sir Edward Carson should arrange for this report to be sent, in.the first instance, to the Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff.[1365-293]B 2
-Russia: .  ./ 11. With reference to War Cabinet 292, Minute 13, the first the Russian Meet. Sea Lord called attention to a telegram received from Sir George- Buchanan, dated the 3rd December, 1917 (No. 1942), dealing withthe position of the Russian Fleet, and forwarding a suggestion,with which Admiral Stanley concurred, that an agreement shouldbe come to with the Russian Government not to enter into any negotiations with the enemy with regard to the fleet, and, if neces-sary, to render their ships useless try disablement of machinery,&amp;c, for the period of the war, so that they could not be . used against the Allies.The War Cabinet decided that- In the present confused situation it was not possible to enterinto negotiations on the subject, but that the matter should be reopened when a suitable occasion arose.British Submarines 12- With reference to War Cabinet 292, Minute 13, the Firstin the Baltic. Sea Lord stated that he had delayed sending instructions to admiral Stanley owing to the receipt of a telegram conveying thesuggestion that the British submarines should be left in charge ofthe Russian Government, with guarantees, and that the crewsshould be given passes to Murmansk.The War Cabinet  agreed to this  suggestion and to thec measures which the First Sea Lord proposed to take todeal with the submarines.Russia:; Supplies.13. With reference to War Cabinet 288, Minutes 9 and 10,attention was drawn to a slight conflict in the decisions taken bythe War Cabinet and the decisions come to at the Paris Conference.In the former case it had been decided that, while no munitionsshould be sent, clothing, &amp;c, should be allowed to go to Russia.According to the Paris decisions, no further supplies were to besent.The discussion of this matter was adjourned until thefollowing day, in order that the Shipping Controllermight be present.Dardanelles 14. The Secretary reported the receipt of the Final Report of commission: the   Dardanelles   Commission,   which   would   be   circulatedFinal Report. immediately to the members of the War Cabinet.Bombing Raid. 15. The First Sea Lord reported that half a ton of bombs hadbeen dropped on Sparappelhoek aerodrome, and also on a trainleaving Engel dump.   No direct hits were observed.Patrol Engagement.16. The First Sea Lord reported that, in a fight of patrols,three enemy machines had been destroyed and one driven down outof control.Man-Power and 17. The War Cabinet continued the discussion of Sir Auck-Recruiting. land Geddes&apos; Paper (G.-174), begun at War Cabinet 289, Minute12.Lord Derby drew attention to a letter from Field-Marshal sir douglas&apos; Haig, dated the 24th November, 1917, pointing out that,if matters were allowed to go on as at present, without a greatlegislative or administrative effort to obtain men, the british infantry divisions in France would be 40 per cent, below theirpresent establishment by the 31st March, 1918.   Since this letter
very grave reports regarding the situation in France had beenreceived from the front. There was no longer any question of ourdeciding what our military policy would be next year, as that willbe decided by the Germans. Sir Douglas Haig was, at this moment, 100,000 men below his proper strength. So far from there being any question of our breaking through the Germans, itwas a question whether we could prevent the Germans breakingthrough us. The Army Council looked, to Sir Auckland Geddes tomake suggestions as to how the very large number of men essential-for the army could be met.Mr. Churchill stated that he agreed with Lord Derby that theposition was one of great danger. He gathered that the deficitwhich required making up during the next six months amountedto approximately 500,000 men. He quite realised that, as far asthe Ministry of Munitions were concerned, they had to find men for release for the army, only he hoped that if the Ministry ofMunitions made the great effort which they were called upon tomake, other Departments, such as the Admiralty, would, by meansof combing out fit men and by the utmost economy in the use ofman-power, produce a substantial quota: he also thought that thedemand for 90,000 men put forward by the Admiralty should be most carefully examined. He thought that use might be made upon small craft for the 60,000 trained American sailors now available. He was examining the question of the number of men available for release from munition.work in its relation to output,and he pointed out that 53,000 men had been released from such work since April 1917. He estimated that by slowing down theoutput of certain munitions and by methods of economy anddilution it might be possible to obtain as many as 120,000 furthermen from munitions during the course of the next twelve months.These figures assumed, of course, that the Trades Unions wouldl)e consulted in accordance with the pledge given by Mr. arthur henderson before skilled men were taken in addition to all dilutees.In his opinion the Government would be wrell advised to face thequestion of man-power in Parliament by presenting simultaneouslyall their proposals for raising men. It would be fatal to deal withthe matter piecemeal by raising successive storms over such questions as the taking of skilled men, the application of con-scription to Ireland, and the raising of the military age. Itappeared to him that the number of men retained for purposes ofHome Defence was large, and that something might be done inthe direction of giving the fighting troops a rest during the comingthree months by the use in the trenches of garrison battalionscomposed of older and low7er category men.Sir Auckland Geddes pointed out that the basic pledge givingprotection to skilled men wTas that made by Mr. Asquith in 1916.If the Government continued on the present lines, without intro-dncing new proposals and without facing a bigger legislativeissue outlined in his memorandum, only 25,000 more men could beobtained from munition works, and a further 35,000 if the pledge given by Mr. Arthur Henderson regarding the taking of diluteesonly was got rid of.Sir Alan Anderson stated that the First Lord was makingcareful enquiries into the man-power employed by the Navy, butadded that the utilisation of the largest reserve of man-power now available for the Allies, viz., that of the United States of America,depended entirely upon the output of ships, and that it was essential that we should concentrate upon this work. 20,000 more men were wanted at once for shipbuilding. In this connection he thought that military labour could be employed in the new national Shipyards, where such labour would not be mixed upwdth civil labour. 17,000 men could thus be employed, and couldreceive a certain amount of military, training at the same time.It was pointed out that the War Office view of the military
situation in France, as submitted to the War Cabinet, had under-gone a complete change during the last three weeks. Three weeks ago, so far from there being any question of the Germans break-ing through our lines, there had been most optimistic reportsregarding the deterioration in the German moral and the superi-ority of the British over their opponents, in numbers as in every-thing else. From the most recent Paper submitted it would appearthat we still had a superiority of 25 per cent, in rifles on theWestern front as a whole.Sir Nevil Macready stated that he had prepared a Papershowing exactly how all the Home Army was being employed,and he did not see how the number so retained could be sub-stantially reduced. With regard to the troops in Ireland, therewere about 50,000, composed of one complete division and twenty-eight reserve draft-finding battalions and coast defence troops.He estimated the number of available &quot;A&quot; category men in this50.000 at not more than 5,000, exclusive of ordinary drafts.Lord Curzon stated that two years ago the Government were faced with a somewhat similar and equally grave decision. Manyabortive discussions had taken place in the Cabinet on the subjectof raising the necessary number of men for the Army, and theonly practical method of dealing with the matter was found to bein the establishment of a small Cabinet Committee whose duty itwas to see all Heads of Departments concerned in order that adefinite scheme might be laid before the Cabinet for acceptance orrejection. This Committee carried out the foundation work uponwhich the Government military service proposals were subsequentlybuilt.The Secretary pointed out that another precedent for sucha Committee was furnished by the Cabinet Committees on theCo-ordination of Military and Financial Effort, which reportedin February and April, 1916.Lord Curzon suggested that a similar Committee should beappointed at this critical juncture, whose duty it should be toproduce a scheme which the Government should present to Parlia-ment as a whole, and upon which the Government should stake its existence.Subject to the Prime Ministers concurrence, the War cabinet decided that -The Prime Minister should appoint a Committee, as suggestedby Lord Curzon, which should report to the Cabinet atthe earliest possible date; and that- meanwhile theMinister of Munitions, the First Lord of the Admiralty,and the Secretary of State for War should at onceprepare full detailed statements for submission to theCommittee.18. The War Cabinet had before them the following docu-ments regarding the Acceptance of Foreign Contracts in Relationto Man-power: (a.) Memoranda by the Minister of National Service (PapersO.T.-2533 and G.T.-2636).(&amp;..). Note by Sir E. Wyldbore Smith (Paper G.T.-2576).(c.) Memorandum by the Minister of Munitions (Paper G.T.-&apos;    2578).and decided that -The points raised in this correspondence should be referredto the War Priorities Committee for their decision.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,December 6, 1917.Acceptance ofForeign contracts in Relation toMan-Power. -
