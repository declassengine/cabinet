The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported the receiptof information from various quarters, including SSpanish sources, tothe effect that heavy attacks on the Western front were threatened by the enetny within the next few weeks, and that greatconcentrations were being made.In this connection the Chief of the Imperial General Staffreported that, during his recent visit to France, he had made enquiries regarding the situation on the Western front, and had found that it was not so secure as could be desired. The defenceson our front were not as good as they should be in order to withstand a heavy and determined attack, and they were not asgood as the German defences we have captured. But it had to beremembered that our troops have been engaged on the offensive forthe greater part of the year, and therefore have not had much time302] - B
to devote to the construction of defences; and, further, we havebeen continually pushing our line forward during the year and thus have had new defences to make. This had been especially difficultto do in the devastated area, where, in addition to making newdefences, we have had to make roads and railways, and buildaccommodation for the troops. While we have had to make newdefences as we have advanced, the German trenches we have captured were the work of years, and they are able to make newdefences beforehand ready for them when they fall back, and theyhave much civil and prisoner labour to assist them. The Frenchdefences also were not in good order, as the Cabinet had heardon the previous day. He had been informed that general petain&apos; had asked the French War Cabinet last week to give him 200,000 men for work on the defences. The Portuguese,instead of being a help to us, were practically a danger, and we hadto keep a division on each of their flanks, as it was felt that theycould not be relied upon. It was also doubtful whether the Belgianswould stand a heavy attack. Further, the enemy was continuallybringing over more artillery, and we may expect that he will bringover a great deal more. Our troops were new, and it remained tobe seen to what extent, they would stand the bombardment to whichthey may be subjected. It must also be remembered that our troopscouid not be. expected to fight as well on the defence as on the offence. They are new, and so are most of the officers, and it hadbeen found necessary, as in the case of all new armies, to give specificinstructions beforehand for the action they ware to take whenfighting. This could be done in offensive operations, and had beendone. In the defence, howrever, it was impossible to give thesespecific instructions in the same detail, as the enemy set the tune,&apos; and it required officers well versed in tactics to know how to meetquickly and properly any new situation which might arise. We hadnot got such officers at the present time. They were quite different from the officers we had when we were fighting on the defensive in1914, and General Robertson learned from divisional commandersthat they were anxious as to how far our officers would show them-selves able to meet a great attack. He had heard the best accounts of the men, but of course they required competent subordinateleaders. Another reason for anxiety in regard to our being on the defensive was that strategically we were in a badposition, as there was very little depth behind our defences, andtherefore we had little room to manoeuvre. When Hindenburggot into difficulties as a result of the Somme fighting, he retiredpart of his line some 20 to 30 miles. We could not do this.Dunkirk was already within range of .the enemy&apos;&quot;s guns, and a shortadvance by the enemy would bring him within range of Calais and&apos; Boulogne. A retirement for even a few miles westward might there-fore be disastrous. Retirement in any other direction was impossible.Further, in the area occupied by us there were certain places near tothe front line which were of great importance to the French, whilethe security of the coast bordering on the Straits of Dover V, as vital to our sea power, upon which the possibility of continuing the wardepended. General Robertson stated that it was fully realised by-Sir Douglas Haig that we must act on the defence for some time tocome, and he had no offensive plans in mind at present. He had therefore given orders for the Armies to go definitely on the defensive,and to take at once all additional defensive measures possible. Fiewould not necessarily fight a decisive battle on his present front line,as there were certain salients and other portions of the line whichwere tactically quite unsuitable for this. Where this was so hewould fight on his front line just sufficient to wear out and break upthe enemy&apos;s attack as much as possible before the enemy could reach the main defensive position. All the men that could be taken fromthe roads and other work in the rear were being sent to the front towork on the defences.   At the present time there were 22 divisions
: .&apos;in reserve&apos; and it was hoped that, of&apos; this number, 8 would be placedin General Reserve directly under the Field-Marshal. This would&quot;be a strategic Preserve, and&apos; available to-, reinforce either our ownfront:or. the &quot;French front, if that were attacked. Similarly, itwas expected that the French would have a reserve of the samenature to assist us if necessary. The Field-Marshal saw general petain the previous day, with a view of completing a definite and combined defensive plan. If our troops could get two orthree months&apos; rest, and meanwhile we could find.additional labour forwork on the defences, the situation, should be considerably improved.There would, however, still be the question of the great amount of artillery and other reinforcements that the enemy could bring over.General Robertson thought that the enemy was equal to us now,and if he could find ammunition for all the artillery he was likely tosend to the Western front, our troops might be subjected to a veryformidable attack.The Prime Minister drew attention to information received through the Russian Embassy, to the effect that the naval attacheat Stockholm had been talking of the German intention to attackon the Western front in the immediate future. The fact that theGermans are talking so freely suggested doubt whether they reallyintend to attack, or whether they are making preparations for attack elsewhere.Accident to Leave 2. With reference to War Cabinet 299, Minute 1, the Chief ofTrain from Italy. the Imperial General Staff reported that the latest informationshowed that this accident was more serious than was originallyreported. Of 985 men, only 359 were uninjured. It was probablethat the accident wras a case of sabotage.The Invasion ofItaly.Battle of Cambrai:Enquiry.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported the receiptof a telegram from General Dekne-RadclifFe, received on the19th December, 1917, to the effect that the enemy had attacked,after heavy bombardment, on the front Ca&apos; d&apos;Anna-Monte Asolone,and succeeded in capturing both objectives. An Italian division hadbeen ordered to make a counter-attack, but the result was not yet known. The serious result was that the only road for. wheeledtraffic up the Grappa was threatened by the capture of MonteAsolone.4. With reference to War Cabinet 299, Minute 8, - theSecretary of State for War reported that, owing to a fall of snowin France, it had not been possible to obtain all the reports required.A summary, however, had been telegraphed, and Lord Derbyundertook to provide the Prime Minister with the necessary material for his statement on the subject in the House of Commons on thefollowing day.Bussian Ice- 5- The First Sea  Lord  reported  that  the   Admiralty  hadBreaker. requisitioned a Russian icebreaker built in this country.   It was&apos; proposed to send this icebreaker to the White Sea, to be used there: in case the Russians fail to give us the necessary assistance.The Position of 6. The War Cabinet had under consideration the position of norway. Norway, as set out in paper G.-184, and adopted the. recommendations contained therein, and requested The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to take the necessarydiplomatic action as regards the United States Governmentand the British Ministers in Stockholm and Christiania.
The Supreme WarCouncil.7. The War Cabinet had before&apos; them a joint note to theSupreme War Council, submitted by its Permanent military advisers (Paper W.P. 69) (Appendix I).The Chief of the Imperial General Staff expressed generalconcurrence in the Report, which was assented to by the WarCabinet.The TransportProblem.8. With reference to War Cabinet 291, Minute 2, and to paragraph 1 (c) of the joint note referred to in the previous Minute,there was some discussion as to the question of the appointment ofan officer to examine and report upon the whole of the transport arrangements of the Allies as approved at the Meeting of theSupreme War Council held at Versailles, on Saturday, the 1stDecember, 1917.It was generally agreed that, as Sir Eric Geddes could not be spared, General Nash would be the best possible selection for thepost.The Wrar Cabinet decided that -This should be pressed by the Prime Minister at the next meeting of the Supreme War Council.The &quot;western front:Extension oi theBritish Line.9. With reference to War Cabinet 301, Minute 8, the W^war cabinet  decided that During the discussions by the Permanent Military Adviser tothe Supreme War Council on the subject of the extensionof the British line, it wras desirable that a representative ofthe Field-Marshal Commanding-in-chief, British Expe-ditionary Force, should be in attendance at Versailles to answer any points raised by the French General Staff.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff undertook to initiatethe necessary action.10. The Secretary informed the War Cabinet that the Field-Marshal Commanding the Home Forces had nothing to add to the communique which had been circulated to the members of the WarCabinet. The Secretary added that he had received information from the Secretary of State for Home Affairs that the whole of the&quot;police reports had not yet been received, but that it appeared thatthe casualties in London were approximately 8 killed and between60 and 70 injured, and that two large fires had broken out as wellas several smaller &quot;conflagrations. In addition to bombs being dropped in London, bombs had been dropped at Margate, and also inother parts of Kent, and in Essex.The First Sea Lord reported that one of the Goth as that took part in the raid had been towed into Folkestone, but had sunk asthe result of au explosion.   Two of the crew were captured.Eussia. 11- The Prime Minister reported a conversation he had had with a Mr. Thompson an American traveller and a man of consider-able means who had just returned from Russia, and who had given a somewhat different impression of affairs in that country from whatwas generally believed. The gist of his remarks was to the effectthat the Revolution had come to stay ; that the Allies had not shown themselves sufficiently sympathetic with tbe Revolution; and thatMM. Trotzki and Lenin were not in German pay, the latter being a fairly distinguished Professor. Mr. Thompson had added that he considered the Allies should conduct in Russia an active propaganda,carried out by some form of Allied Council composed of men especially
2n f-0 3Stockholm 12. Mr. Barnes informed the War Cabinet that Mr. HendersonConterence. bad called on him yesterday, and had stated that he had received atelegram from M. Huysmans asking Mr. Henderson to press for anInternational Conference at Stockholm, _ to counteract maligninfluences. The latter had asked Mr. Barnes whether it was probable that the Government would grant the necessary passportsfor such a conference at Stockholm, and, on Mr. Barnes replying inthe negative, Mr. Henderson had stated that he would not press the matter for Stockholm, but would suggest some alternative place for the meeting.. selected for the purpose; further, that, on the whole, he considered,having regard to the character of the de facto Russian Government,the several Allied Governments were not suitably represented inPetrograd. In Mr. Thompson&apos;s opinion, it was necessary for theAllies to realise that the Russian army and people were out of thewar, and that the Allies would have to choose between Russia as a friendly or a hostile neutral.The question was discussed as to whether the Allies ought notto change their policy in regard to the de facto Russian Government,the.Bolsheviks being stated by Mr. Thompson to be anti-German.In this connection Lord Robert Cecil drew attention to theconditions of the armistice between the German and Russian armies,which provided, inter alia, for trading between the two countries,and for the establishment of a Purchasing Commission in Odessa, thewhole arrangement being obviously dictated by the Germans. lord robert Cecil expressed the view that the Germans would endeavourto continue the armistice until the Russian army had melted away.Sir Edward Carson read a communication, signed by M. Trotzki,which had been sent to him by a British subject, the manager of theRussian branch of the Vauxhall Motor Company, who had just returned from Russia (Paper G.T.-3040) (Appendix II). This reportindicated that M. Trotzki&apos;s policy was, ostensibly at any rate, one of hostility to the organisation of civilised society rather than pro-German. On the other hand, it was suggested that an assumedattitude of- this kind was by no means inconsistent with Trotzki&apos;sbeing a German agent, whose object was to ruin Russia in order thatGermany might do what she desired in that country.Lord Robert Cecil suggested that the best plan was to continuethe present policy of rallying to the Allies, and assisting all those elements in South Russia that were resisting the Bolsheviks, and stated that he had received information from Jewish sources that theUkranians were prepared to oppose the existing Russian Government.It was stated that M. Huysmans had confirmed this statement,and had urged the sending of, sayT, 100 Socialists to South Russia toact on our behalf.Lord Robert Cecil suggested that, in order to render our policymore effective, we should place funds at the disposal of Sir CharlesMarling, our Minister in Teheran, and give him a free hand to dothe best he can by agents, propaganda, and any other means, to keepthe people of South Russia on our side. Lord Robert Cecilmentioned that the Jews were very powerful in the Ukraine, and itmight be possible to obtain their support.Against this was urged the impossibility of influencing SouthernRussia from such a distant place as Teheran, and also the difficulty ofobtaining suitable persons who were conversant with the Russianlanguage. - It was further suggested that if the Bolsheviks shouldgain the upper hand and eventually achieve complete success, theevidence of the support we had given to their opponents wouldintensify their irritation and throw them even more into the handsof the Germans than they are now.
13. The Prime Minister read to the War Cabinet a letter hehad received from Mr. Henderson, forwarding a resolution from theParliamentary Committee of the Labour Party, desiring that theGovernment should make a declaration as to the war aims of theAllies for the consideration of the Labour Party Conference thatwill meet on 2Sth December next.Mr. Barnes stated that Mr. Henderson was anxious to consult with the Prime Minister or the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs *on the subject.The Prime Minister indicated his willingness that Mr. Hendersonshould see Mr. Balfour in this connection.The War Cabinet proceeded to have a short discussion as to any announcement of the war aims of the Allies, and it was pointed outthat the question of the Balkans was probably the most difficult toset out.It was stated that it might be assumed that Russia no longermade any claim to Constantinople, but that it was imperative ifany statement was made that dealt with Turkey that it must bemade quite clear that that Power would not be allowed to exercise any control of the waterway between the Black Sea and theMediterranean.2, Whitehall Gardens, S^W.,December 19, 1917.
APPENDIX I.W.P.-69. -Joint Note 1.Joint note to the Supreme War Council submitted by its permanent military Representatives.Military Policy.To the Supreme War Council.THE Permanent Military Representatives having, in accordance with theinstructions contained in M. Clemenceau&apos;s address to the Supreme War Council on the1st December and in the resolutions subsequently passed by the Supreme WarCouncil, reviewed the general military situation by the light of the information furnished by the General Staffs of their respective Governments, and, taking intoconsideration the possible consequences of the armistice on the Russian front, thepresent position with regard to man-power in the Allied countries and the necessityimposed of finding men for the production of munitions, the replacement of tonnage,and the increase of domestic food production, &amp;c, are of opinion that the policy outlinedbelow should be adopted by the Allied Governments and put into execution by their general Staffs without delay : 1. A definite and co-ordinated system of defence from the North Sea to the adriatic must be adopted by the Allies.   This will include : (a.) Tbe reconsideration of existing lines of defence and the construction of further and successive defensive lines to check an advance by the enemy.(6.) The use to the utmost of all possible mechanical means in order (i.) To provide the maximum mobile reserve.(ii.) To afford rest and opportunities of training for reserves.(c.) The greatest possible development of rail and sea communications betweenthe different sections of the front and the preparations to be made for themovement of troops between these different sections, especially in respect ofthe Italian front, and of the measures to be taken in case of a german attack through Switzerland.The defensive policy thus advocated need not preclude such minor forms of activedefence as any Commander-in-Chief may think necessary for maintaining the offensivespirit of his troops.Furthermore, the policy of a strong defensive not only does not preclude, butactually prepares for, any offensive measures in any theatre of war as may be decided upon for 1918, when the present political situation in Russia and the military situationin Italy are more clearly defined.2. A simdar policy of definite defence must be adopted in the Balkans. In theevent of serious attack by the enemy in this theatre of war, in which it might beimpossible adequately to reinforce the troops now available, it is necessary to envisagethe possibility of a systematic and pre-arranged retirement from part, at any rate, ofthe existing front. The character and direction of such a retirement is so intimatelyconnected with considerations arising out of Balkan politics and the submarine warfarethat it will form the subject of a separate paper.3. With regard to the Turkish theatre of war (Palestine, Mesopotamia, Armenia),the Permanent Military Representatives are not yet in a position to make any recommendations as to the possibility of further developing and exploiting the successesrecently gained by the Allied forces.4. The co-ordinated development to the utmost of the manufacture of all warmaterial is of paramount importance, as is also the use of this war material so as toobtain the best results from existing formations. This proposal may involve changes inthe organisation of certain existing armies.[1365-302 D
5. In view of the prospect of a greatly increased supply of aeroplanes of constantlyincreasing power and range in the course of 1918, the Permanent Military Representa-tives wish to draw attention to the necessity for a careful study of the possibilities of aco-ordinated air offensive on the largest possible scale.6. The above are the principles which should be adopted forthwith, and thePermanent Military Representatives will submit reports in detail on these subjects at alater date.(Signed) WEYGAND,Perm.

This isthe first really large scale trial of Government by the labouring masses. Till now theGovernment of a country was simply an instrument of power wdelded by a small sectionwhich possessed everything over a large part which possessed nothing. Our plan is toform a Government based on the power of the larger mass of the people, which largermass is now freeing itself from the oppression of the small mass. Government by thesmall mass has so far generally caused poverty and misery to the larger mass. TheSoviet is the main organ of this new power in the centre and provinces of Russia.Our programme is dictated by the interests of workers and peasants. Peace isessential to them. The power of our Soviet is an instrument for fighting for peace.In this fight for peace we are not reckoning oh the good-will of the bourgeois and itsdiplomacy,&apos;but on the pressure of the people. No official or semi-official patriotic liecan screen the fact that the labouring masses in all the warring countries are revolutionisedto the very depths by this disgraceful slaughter, which does no more than show up the criminal character of capitalistic rule. The masses in all the countries hate the war andwho caused the war.Revolution broke out first in Russia only for the reason that the machinery ofgovernment was weaker in Russia than in other countries. But the war has in allcountries caused an accumulation of revolutionary yearnings in the very depths of mankind, and revolution will break out earlier than is expected by the ruling parties of Europe. The plan of our universal policy is to give a push to the revolution in thecentre and on the west of Europe.   This is the real road to a democratic peace.&quot;What about Belgium ? Alsace-Lorraine ? We did not at the commencement ofthe war believe, and do not believe now, that the war is carried on by the ruling classfor the sake of guarding the rights of weak nations. No 1 the bourgeois of all countries are fighting for property. If it could be imagined that the war will pass withoutpunishment to the ruling classes, and that imperialism will remain the guiding hand in politics of so-called civilised people, it would be naive to think of the defending of weak and backward nations. Imperialism took everything and made slaves of everybody.Only the. undefeated revolution of the working classes against imperialism can freeBelgium, Alsace-Lorraine, and all weaker countries,..: We are convinced that the German peoples, who are now shedding their ownblood, will not allow the German ruling-class officers to attack revolutionary Russia.We are sure there will be a temporary peace on all fronts. But if (though we find itimpossible to imagine this) against our straight and open proposition of immediatedemocratic peace, the German people remain passive and the German Kaiser moves hisarmies against us, our army will defend itself to the last drop of blood, because it isnot now a question of an imperialistic war, but it is the question of.guarding therevolution, which offers peace to everybody.We have given over the land of Russia from the landowner to the peasant, andthe peasant will not pay anything for it.
We are placing a workers&apos; control over production, with the object of gradually-changing over the basis of production from capitalistic on to socialistic lines.We are nationalising all banks, with the object of making one national bank. Inthese matters we shall act fearlessly and without pity, overcoming the resistance oflandowners and capitalists who do not wish to give up their privileges without a fight.Our plans are colossal, difficult, grandiose, but the strength of the people, openedup by the revolution, will overcome all difficulties and fulfil its ideals.(Signed) L.
