THE Director of Military Operations stated that the onlyfresh news of a definite character from the Italian front was contained in the German official communique. From this it appeared that some 60,000 Italian troops and great quantities of guns hadbeen captured by the enemy, who had succeeded in cutting them offbefore they crossed the Tagliamento. It appeared probable that acertain proportion of the 60,000 prisoners belonged to the ThirdItalian Army.2. The Director of Military Operations quoted from telegrams which had been received from Sir William Robertson, the contents of which confirmed the information he had communicated in his[1365-263]The Invasion ofItaly.
British Troops for 3. With reference to War Cabinet 262, Minute 7, the Director- Italy. of Military Operations indicated the place of concentration of theFrench troops pioceeding to Italy, and stated that General Fochhad refused General Cadorna&apos;s request to have the French atTreviso.As regards the point of concentration for the British reinforce-- ments for Italy, General Maurice indicated certain areas which hadbeen considered by our Military Authorities as suitable points of assembly in the event of such an eventuality arising. Havingregard to the fact that it was almost certain that the Italian troops would be unable to make a stand on the Tagliamento, and might be equally unable to hold the line of the &apos; Piave, General Mauriceindicated the area nearest to the front which he considered safe forour troops.After some discussion the War Cabinet decided that The place of concentration for the British reinforcements shouldbe left to our Military Authorities.4. With reference to War Cabinet 262, Minute 8, and WarCabinet 260, Minute 1, the Wa&apos;r Cabinet further considered thequestion of the officer to whom the Chief Command of the Britishtroops in Italy should be entrusted, in connection with which thename of Sir Henry Rawlinson had been mentioned, should it bedecided to despatch additional divisions to the Italian front. these divisions, General Maurice stated, could not begin to leave theFrench front until the 10th November.The Secretary of State for War undertook to submit at once tothe War Cabinet the names of other suitable Commanders.Air Offensive. 5. The  Director   of Military Operations reported that in aprojected raid upon Kaiserlauten, which contained 90,000 inhabi-tants, one of our air formations had failed to reach the objective.It had, however, managed to destroy one enemy aircraft, and had returned without any losses.Further british assistance to Italy.The Western Front:Return of casulties.previous telegrams (War Cabinet 262, Minute 5). In a telegram,dated from Rome, tbe Chief of the Imperial General Staff reportedthat he had seen Baron Sonnino, who had assured him that firm andenergetic measures would be taken at once to restore the situation.Both Baron Sonnino and the Italian Minister of War reported thatthe general feeling in the country- was calm and restrained, and thatthere was every reason to hope that the nation would pull itselftogether.It was pointed out that the attitude of the Italian nation,however admirable and reassuring it might be, would be of little value if the army fell to pieces.Sir William Robertson stated that both the above Ministers hadadverted to the unpopidarity of the British and French in Italy,regarding which he had sent a separate telegram.
Submarines. 8. The First Sea Lord reported the receipt of a message fromDover to the effect that &quot; E. 52 &quot; had sunk &quot; U.O. 63 &quot; on the morning of the 1st November, about 20 miles east of the north foreland.   One wounded sarvivor had been rescued.Kussia.9. The First Sea Lord stated that the Naval Attache at petrograd reported that on the 27th October the enemy hadevacuated Werder Island (Moon Sound, Gulf of Riga).German warships in the North Sea.10. The First Sea Lord reported that a message had beenreceived from Copenhagen to the effect that four German light cruisers and four destroyers had gone north. This informationmust not be regarded as reliable, but if it were true there was thepossibility of a light to-day, as we had forces operating in theKattegat supported by heavy ships.commercial agreement with spain.11. The Minister of Blockade informed the War Cabinet that,at the urgent request of the Minister of Munitions, he had beennegotiating with the Spanish Government with a view to establishing a regular flow of iron ore from Spain in return for coal from thiscountry. The arrangement would include the employment of spanish shipping. This agreement had been on the point of com-pletion when it had broken down owing to the change in theSpanish Government. After the new Government had been formed,negotiations had been recommenced, and again had reached thepoint of agreement when the Spanish Government had insisted thata certain proportion of their sweet oranges and wine should be bought by us, as well as their iron ore. The British treasury had raised objections to this arrangement on grounds of exchange,and had said that they could not pay for the wine or fruit.Negotiations had again been resumed with the Spanish Ambassador,and finally an agreement had been obtained from him that if wewould take the wine and fruit the Spanish Government would remove their legislative difficulty against the sale of foreign securities.It was pointed out that the Ministry of Munitions viewed withthe greatest alarm the possible failure of the agreement, which,would mean the cessation of all shipments from Spain which werevitally necessary for munitions. Although no definite figures were submitted to the War Cabinet showing the sums of money requiredfor the purchase of the wine and fruit, it was mentioned that theamount of the risk would be roughly a few hundred thousandpounds.Lord Robert Cecil asked for the authority of the Governmentto allow him to make the best terms he could with the, SpanishGovernment.The War Cabinet decided that-In view of the importance of maintaining the flow of ore ship-ments from Spain to this country, the Minister of Blockadeshould be allowed to sign the agreement with the Spanish.Government, provided that the Spanish Government would remove their embargo on foreign loans.Palestine. 7. With, reference to War Cabinet 262, Minute 9, the Directorof Military Operations reported that General Allenby&apos;s troops had established themselves to the north of Beersheba. General Allenbywas completing his preparations before resuming the offensive.
Ireland.Proposed SupremeInter-allied council and allied general Staff.proposed conference in italy.12. The Prime Minister stated that on the previous eveninginformation had been received from the Head of the irish constabulary, through the General 0racer Commanding,*Ireland,that a serious seditious movement was threatened for Sunday next.With his authority, the Chief Secretary had proceeded forthwith toIreland.The War Cabinet approved the action, and authorised The Secretary of State for War to support the Field-marshal commanding Home Defences and the General OfficerCommanding in Ireland in making all necessary military dispositions and movements, some of which were discussed by the War Cabinet with the Secretary of State for Warand the Field-Marshal Lord French.(6.)13. With reference to War Cabinet 262, Minute .13, the PrimeMinister informed the War Cabinet that he had seen M. Painleve,and that the French Government accepted the scheme for theestablishment of a Supreme Inter-Allied Council and PermanentAdvisory General Staff. General Petain, whom he had also seen,cordially approved the scheme, and had expressed the opinion that,in view of the very serious position on the Italian front, the new organisation should set to work as soon as possible.After some discussion, the War Cabinet decided (a.) To accept in principle the proposal for the establishmentof a Supreme Inter-Allied Council, consisting of thePrime Minister and one other Minister, who would meet at frequent intervals, together with a Permanent Inter-Allied Advisory General Staff composed of one GeneralOfficer from each of the principal Allies.That Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Wilson should beappointed the British General on the Inter-AlliedAdvisory General Staff, and that it should be a recom-mendation to the Secretary of State for War that theappointment should carry with it the temporary rank ofGeneral. The Secretary of State for War expressed his approval of General Wilson&apos;s appointment.That the Secretary should formally communicate the twoabove decisions to the Secretary of State for War, whowould notify his appointment to Lieutenant-general sir Henry Wilson and arrange details as to his pay. and staff.That no announcement in regard to the Supreme Inter-Allied Council and General Staff, or in regard toGeneral Wilson&apos;s appointment,. should be made untilthe attitude of the Italian Government towards thescheme had been ascertained.That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should telegraph to the Italian Government the general lines ofthe scheme.(d.)(e.)14. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that general petain considered the Italian position to be extremely serious, andhad expressed doubts as to, whether the Italian army really existedany longer. If it did exist, it was probably only in the shape of individual units, and not as an army. The only prospect of re-establishing it as an army was for the Allies to obtain some positionin regard to it, such as had been assumed by the Germans towardsthe Austrians. With this - object in view, General Petain had suggested a scheme for a redistribtition of the Western front,according to which the Commander-in-Chief of the British Expedi-tionary Force would assume Command of all the British and french forces from the Channel, to some point considerably further to the
south than the line at present occupied by the British troops, whilethe French Commanrier-in-Ohief would command all the allied forces from that point southwards to the Adriatic, including theItalian front and the Franco-Swiss frontier, in the event of aGerman attack through Switzerland.Originally the French Government had proposed to sendM. Franklin-Bouillon to Italy to try and induce the Italian Govern-ment to accept this scheme, but in the conversations in the morningit had been proposed that the Prime Minister and M. Painleveshould proceed to a town in North Italy to meet representatives ofthe Italian Government, and the Prime Minister commended thisproposal to his colleagues, insisting, however, that he should be accompanied by one of them.In the course of the discussion it was pointed out that greatdifficulty might be found in inducing the Italian Government toaccept this scheme. It was also suggested that if the Italiansobjected to any form of French or British control it might benecessary to indicate that our assistance would be dependent ontheir assent. It was further suggested that the proposal might bemade more palatable to the Italian Government if General Cadornabecame the Allied representative on the Inter-Allied AdvisoryGeneral Staff.It was pointed out that the Italians wotdd almost certainlyprefer to be placed under a British - rather than,a French general,since the Italians and French were temperamentally uncongenial toone another, and it was suggested that, in the last resort, the PrimeMinister should have authority to assent to such an arrangement,although General Petain&apos;s plan was preferred.Considerable stress was laid on the seriousness of the presentsituation in Italy and Russia. It was pointed out that the gunscaptured from Italy not only increased very materially the artilleryat the disposal of the enemy, particularly as a large amount of italian ammunition had been captured in addition, but to the same extent reduced the artillery of the Allies ; also that if the russians were unable to exert any pressure on the enemy, or made a separate peace, some 8,000 additional guns would be set free for service onthe Western front. There was, therefore, no prospect of an Alliedsuperiority in artillmw on the Western front in 1918.The War Cabinet approved the Prime MinisteFs proposal to visit Italy with one colleague, and decided on the following action : (1 ) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should telegraph the proposal for a visit by the Prime Ministerand M. Painleve to the British Ambassador at Rome for theinformation of the Italian Government.(2.) That the Prime Minister shotdd be accompanied by onecolleague, as well as by the Chief of the Imperial&apos; General Staff and the Secretary of the War Cabinet.(3.) That the Director of Military Operations should telegraph to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff asking him to await the arrival of the Prime Minister in Paris.(4.) That Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig should meet thePrime Minister in Paris.15. The Prime Minister informed the War Cabinet that theFrench Minister of Munitions had telegraphed to the effect that theItalian Minister of Munitions had made application to him forassistance in replacing the artillery and ammunition recently lost bythe Italian army, and that M. Loucheur had suggested that aConference between the British, French, and Italian Ministers ofMunitions should take place within the next ten days in NorthItaly.
(jThe War Cabinet decided that It would be premature to hold a Munitions Conference until after the large questions of policy referred to in the two previous Minutes had been settled with the ItalianGovernment.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,November 2, 1917.
