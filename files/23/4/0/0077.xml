Lord Robert Cecil brought before the War Cabinet thevague nature of the attitude of the British Government towardsthe developments in Russia, and pressed for some definite policy to be laid down.It was pointed out that there were in reality four differentproblems in the situation, which, though they formed part of onequestion, were being treated more or less separately, viz. The question of Roumania;The question of the Ukraine;The question of the Don Cossacks;The question of the Caucasian Cossacks;and that the necessity for a clear analysis of the situation, and ofwhat was being done in regard to each, was daily growing more urgent, since the information coming in from the differentBritish local representatives was sometimes mutually contra-dictory, while it varied from day to day.It appeared that one of the chief difficulties in carrying outthe policy already outlined (War Cabinet 298, Minute 10), of givingfinancial assistance to those races and organisations likely to keep[13(55-303] B 26.

The War Cabinet had before them a proposal, by theFirst Commissioner of Works, that the British Museum shouldbe acquired for the accommodation of the Air Ministry (PapersG.T.-2950, 2873, and 2901). In favour of the proposal it was stated that the existing accommodation of the Hotel Cecil wasnot sufficient for the Ministry, whereas the British-Museum wouldprovide ample room of a suitable nature under one roof, and thatsuch accommodation could not be obtained elsewhere. The FlotelCecil would, on vacation, by the Air Ministry, be taken over bythe Aeronautical Supplies Department of the Ministry ofMunitions.On the&apos;other&apos; hand, against the proposal were the difficultyof moving many of the priceless art treasures contained in theMuseum,, and the increased danger to which these would be exposed from aerial bombardment when the Germans realised that the Museum was being used for War purposes. The trustees of the Museum were against the proposed appropriation, as was mr. Fisher. The director of the British Museum was against theproposal,&apos; and stated that no large proportion of the contents ofthe Museum could be moved unless a great amount of timber andtransport could be provided.r &quot; In consideration of the fact that there was no feasible alter-native: to the proposal,.the&apos;War Cabinet decided that The British Museum should be taken over for occupation bythe Air Ministry. n,(Lord Curzon wished his dissent from the above decision tobe placed on record.)14.

The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the First Commissioner of Works, on the question of removingfrom Whitehall departments not directly concerned in connectionwith the prosecution of the war,*in order to provide additional accommodation urgently required bv the war departments (paper g.T.-2951). . ..     .       ..   .* 1 V    sir Alfred Mond explained the necessity for the proposal,which was, to provide additional accommodation required by theMilitary Intelligence Directorate of the War Office at 69-71,Hayrharket, which demand could only be met by the removal of anAdmiralty Staff from adjoining premises, &quot;Greener House.&quot;To enable this to be done, it was proposed to transfer the Office of woods, from. Whitehall. to a portion of the Natural HistoryMuseum, South Kensington, and to move the Admiralty staff from Greener House to the Office of Woods building.The President of , the Board of Agriculture and Mr. G.Leveson-Gower said&apos; that the proposed move would cause someinconvenience to the Board of Agriculture and the Office of Woods,since those Departments shared the services of certain membersof their staffs. Mr. Prothero suggested an alternative, that theOffice of Woods should retain the accommodation on the first floor of the building occupied by them, whilst the Admiralty shouldtake over the rest of the block.The War Cabinet decided that The First Commissioner of Works and the President of theBoard of Agriculture should go into the matter, a:id, ifpossible, arrange a compromise on the above lines.Petroleum Produc-tion Bill.18.

Lord Crawford gave certain details as to the proposal to takeover Edinburgh Castle as a Scottish National War Museum, andthe conditions suggested by the Committee.It was pointed out that, since the War Office would not requirethe Castle as a barracks after the war,, it might be possible toremove certain recently erected barrack buildings, which were very inartistic..   ,&apos;: The Secretary for Scotland explained that the inception ofthe scheme was due to the Duke of Atholl, and that H.R.H. the duke of Cdnnaught had been pleased to express his strongapproval of it.    . ... :    -The &quot;War: Cabinet approved the recommendations of LordCrawford&apos;s Committee, and decided that The Secretary for Scotland should take such steps as he con-sidered advisable to announce the decision of the Cabinet,which should also be communicated to the Duke ofAtholl, and to take the further steps suggested in the interim Report
British Honduras. 19- The War Cabinet took note of the Memorandum on theDefence of British Honduras, brought before them by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (Paper G.T.-2862), and, asregards the suggestion about General Alvarada, in the last para-graph of the Memorandum, decided To take no action until the matter was again raised by theSecretary of State for the Colonies.Coal for Italy. 20. With  reference  to War  Cabinet 283, Minute 15, theShipping Controller brought before the War Cabinet the critical situation caused by the fact that the French Government seemeddisinclined to do its part in helping to supply Italy with coal.He explained that the French had now increased their coal out-put by about one million tons per month as compared with lastyear, and were now themselves producing over two million tons per month, while they were receiving from us one and a half million tons per month. Of the total produced by France,700,000 tons was obtained in Southern France. It had been proposed that of this amount, France should supply Italy atonce with 150,000 tons a month, and it is suggested that this amount might in clue course be increased to 300,000 tons. TheBritish Government would then take this into consideration inth,e amount supplied to France by them, adding it to whatever,on a general review of the situation, appear to be France&apos;s realrequirements,, though not the quantity actually now being supplied. The Shipping Controller had recently handedM. Clementel a document containing the proposal that france should give Italy 150,000 tons of coal a month. As there hadbeen no immediate response from the French Government to thisproposal, the Shipping Controller was of opinion that thematter was sufficiently serious to bring before the War Cabinet,with a request that a telegram on the subject should be sent bythe Prime Minister to the French Prime Minister.The War Cabinet, in view of the critical situation likely tobe produced in Italy owing to lack of coal, decided that The Shipping Controller should prepare a message to besent by the Prime Minister to M. Clemenceau, asking him to give immediate attention to this subject; this draft telegram to be submitted for the concurrence ofLord Milner.(Initialled) A. B. L.^Whitehall Gardens, S.W.December 20, 1917.Minute 3), recommending that the Bill should be dropped andthat a Defence of the Realm Regulation, in the form specified,should be inserted.The War Cabinet approved of the action recommended in theReport of the Committee.
