Proposed Purchase 1. THE Minister of Blockade said that last year it had been of Italian Oranges, ascertained that large quantities of oranges- had gone from Italy toGermany, through Switzerland. The result of this had been badfrom the blockade point of view, not only directly but also indirectly,inasmuch as it had been difficult to prevent oranges going toGermany from Spain and apples from America. In order to prevent this traffic with the enemy, last year we purchased half the Italianorange crop at a loss of about 500,000L This year the same question had arisen, and the Treasury had said that it would be impossibleto make a similar purchase. The Treasury had, however, agreedto pay 1,00Q,00(K provided that the ordinary credits to Italy werediminished by the same amount, in order to prevent injury to exchange. Lord Robert Cecil pointed out that, if we refused topiirchase the oranges, the orange trade with Germany would be resumed, and the effect on the Italian people would be serious.Moreover, it was feared that the Italian Minister of Finance wouldjump at the excuse to resume not only the orange trade but also thesilk trade with Germany. Lord Robert Cecil urged that, though itmight have been arguable whether it was wise to stop the trade inthe first instance, it would create the worst possible impression ifwe allowed that trade to be resumed. The French Blockade minister was lukewarm in the matter, but Lord Robert Cecil had pointed outthe seriousness of the position to M. Painleve on the previous day,and M. Painleve had agreed that it would be fatal to allow the orange trade with Germany to be reopened.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, unless the french would pay half the cost of the undertaking, he could not sanction the expenditure on the part of our Treasury. His objection wasthat, in advancing the money for the oranges, we were not makinga loan but a present to Italy of about 1,200,000Z. It must beremembered that Ave were being asked to subsidise an Italianindustry while numerous industries in our country are being ruined.His main ground for refusal, in the event of the French not joiningus, was on account of the injury to exchange.Lord Robert Cecil said that he understood that the Frenchwoidd pay half, but he undertook to see the French Ministers again on the subject.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) Provided the French would pay half the cost of the under-taking, the treasury should advance the sums requiredfor the purpose of purchasing the oranges, in order toprevent the orange trade between Italy and Germanybeing resumed.(6.) The Minister of Blockade should see the French ministers in London on the subject,(c.) If the Minister of Blockade was unable to obtain a satis-factoiy reply from the French Ministers he should again. . bring the matter to the War Cabinet.The Western Front. 2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that our troops were attacking on a front of 5 or 6 miles, with Passchendaeleas objective, and that satisfactory progress was reported.Question of 3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he hadextending British received two visits from General Foch in regard to our taking overkines. more of the line from the French.   At the first interview, general foch had said that lie did not Avish to press the matter until thepresent offensive was over, but at the second interview he had saidthat he wished us to extend our line to Cerny a length of about60 miles as the French had to send some 100,000 men to agriculture.   On this part of the French line there were some
Russia: 4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that he hadSeduction of received   information that   the Russians were going to disbandDivisions. 59 third line divisious, which would reduce their total number of divisions from 229 to 170.Greek Ifobilisation. 5. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that a message had been received from the French Mission at Athens tothe effect that the Greek mobilisation cannot be expected beforenext April unless immediate steps are taken to get the militaryrailways going again. *German Naval 6. The First Lord said that there had been reports for someMutiny. time that the state of affairs in German ships had been bad.   TheAdmiraity&apos;s view was that the trouble had been serious.The attention of the War Cabinet was also drawn to a telegramfrom Christiania of the 10th October, in which it was reported from-a reliable source that certain German sailors had been shot for refusing to sail in submarines.Sir Edward Carson asked what steps should be taken in thematter with a view to propaganda work.The War Cabinet decided that The reports should be published in our newspapers, but withoutany official authority as far as the Government were concerned. Sir Edward Carson to be responsible for initiating action.Publication of 7. With  reference   to   War  Cabinet 217,  Minute   18,   theGaza Despatch. attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to the fact that the&quot;Times&quot; had again criticised the holding up of Sir A. Murray despatch. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he hoped the despatch would not be published until after general allenby&apos;s offensive. He felt inclined to write to Mr. GeoffreyDawson, the editor of the &quot;Times,&quot; telling him that the despatchhad been held up for this reason.The War Cabinet authorised The Chief of the Imperial General Staff to write privately toMr. Dawson in this sense.Submarine Losses. 8. The First Sea Lord reported that the armed merchant cruiser&quot;Champagne&quot; had been torpedoed and sunk on the 9th Octoberoff the east coast of Ireland. The casualties amounted to about fourofficers and fifty men.300,000 men, and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff had notbeen able to get a satisfactory explanation as to the disposal of theremaining 200,000. At present, the French have 43 Divisions in reserve, and yet General Petain, who is not fighting, refuses to release men for agriculture unless we take over more line. Atpresent we are holding more German Divisions in proportion thanthe Freuch are. 62 British Divisions are holding 57 german divisions, of which 3 are Landwehror Landsturm, while 108 french divisions are holding 91 German Divisions, of which 16. areLandwehr or Landsturm. Therefore, omitting Landwehr orLandsturm, the hold British I to &apos;87, and the French 1 to &apos;69. TheFrench Government give every man ten days&apos; leave every four months.
The &quot; Bostonian,&quot; another armed merchant cruiser, had been torpedoed and sunk in the Channel while escorting a convoy.In view of these two losses, and also the case of H.M.S, &quot; Drake,&quot;the First Sea Lord said that it appeared likely that the enemy submarines were making a dead set at the escort of convoys.The sloop &quot; Begonia,&quot; reported missing four days ago, had notbeen heard of since, and it was probable that she had been torpedoedwith a loss of about 100 lives.Transport of 9. With reference to War Cabinet 162, Minute 6, the WarPortuguese Troops. cabinet had before them a memorandum by the First Lord of theAdmiralty in regard to the continued failure of the Portuguese tomake use of the transports placed at their disposal (Paper G-.T.-2069).In this memorandum the First Lord pointed out that two transports,the &quot; Bellerophon &quot; and &quot; Inventor,&quot; had been allocated to the service in question. Both vessels were valuable cargo carriers, but neither of them was being adequately employed.The First Lord pointed out that some time had elapsed sincethe date of his memorandum, namely, the 18th September, and inthe meantime he had withdrawn the two vessels from the Portugueseservice.The War Cabinet approved of this action on the part of theFirst Lord.Coal for Italy. 10. With reference to War Cabinet 243, Minute 17, the WarCabinet resumed their discussion on the memorandum by theMinistrv of Shipping respecting the supply of coal for Italy (paper g.T.-2I6O). &apos;With regard to the allocation of eleven Italian destroyers for thepurpose of escort in the Mediterranean, the First Sea Lor. I pointedout that it would be unwise to press the Italian Government furtherfor these destroyers at the moment, in view of the fact that they arenow required in the Adriatic for screening monitors.In the memorandum by the Ministry of Shipping it &quot;was proposed to suggest to the Italians that they should make an appealto America, endorsed by us. To save tonnage, the proposal shouldbe on the basis of America sending what ships she can on atriangular voyage, America-United ,Kingdom, United Kingdom-Italy, and then out with pyrites to the United States of America,Great Britain putting in an extra collier to Italy for every cargodelivered in the United Kingdom under the arrangement, so that each round voyage by an American ship would mean two cargoes toItaly and one to the United States of America.The War Cabinet decided that It shoidd be suggested to the Italians that they should make anappeal to America for tonnage, as indicated above.ThelWar Cabinet authorised The Shipping Controller to confer with the representatives ofthe Italian Government with&apos; a view to agreeing the formof the communications to America.11. Attention was drawn to the lack of co-ordination betweenthe various Departments and Committees dealing with inventions,and to criticisms that had been received regarding one or other ofthese Committees. The latter seemed to work in watertightcompartments, and it was thought that more use might be made ofAllied experience.Lord Curzon reported that, when at the Air Board, he had had
Increase of Wages 12. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by to Skilled Workers    Mr. Barnes (Paper G.T.-2245) and a Report to the Controller of theon Time Rates.        Admiralty by Sir Lynden Macassey on the effect of the proposed order by the Minister of Munitions, under Section 1 of the munitions of War Act, 1917, for wages advances to certain time-paid skilled men (Paper G.T.-2255).Mr. Churchill said that one of the great industrial anomalies ofthe war was that higher wages wrere being earned by semi-skilled men on repetition work as compared with the wages earned byskilled time-workers, some of whom had been the teachers of these -skilled. On the 15th August, just before Parliament rose, hehad indicated that an attempt would be made to remedy this anomaly. The subject is immediately important, because the abolitionof leaving certificates from Monday next may lead to the degradationof labour through the movement downwards of skilled men into the ranks of the semi-skilled. On the 21st August he had appointed aCommittee, under the Chairmanship of Major J. W. Hills, M.P., todraw up a scheme of remuneration which would help to remedy theinequality which had arisen. His hope had been that the Committeewould be able to recommend a lump sum grant in relation to output.The majority of the Committee, however, including the chairman and all the official members, had come to the conclusion that thiswas not possible, on the grounds that additional pay to the skilledtime-worker was overdue, and that the Trade Unions would resentsuch overdue payment being used as a lever to introduce a wideradoption of payment by result. The extension of payment by residtwas highly controversial, and the Trade Unions would certainly beoffended if an attempt wrere made to spread it by indirect means.He (Mr. Churchill) accepted the recommendation of the majority ofthe Committee. The employers&apos; representatives on the Committeewished to restrict the grant of bonuses to a very limited class ofspecial skilled men, and to exclude auy man who had been given and had refused an opportunity of working on a system of payment by result. Such a decision would certainly have caused offence.He had therefore decided to accept in principle the proposal to grant a bonus of 15 per cent, on earnings of certain scheduled workers,and the Treasury had assented to the expenditure involved,, namely,about 8,00O,000L per annum. He had discarded an alternativesuggestion to embrace a larger class of workers and make the advance 12^ per cent, instead of 15 per cent.Sir Lynden Macassey said that in January last the War cabinet had decided that the system of payment by result should be extendedthrough the engineering and shipbuilding yards, and a great dealhad been done in this direction by the Admiralty. There had,however, been all along a counter-movement in favour of abandoningpayment by results, and introducing in its place a time-rate, e.g.,time and a half, or time and three-quarters, which would bring up earnings roughly to the level of piece-work earnings. Therewas a strong movement of this kind among the boilermakers, forexample. To grant the bonus to skilled men, as recommended bythe Ministry of Munitions, would make it almost impossible to carryon the agitation in favour of payment by result. The present piece-work rates are fixed on the basis of the time-rates. To grant anempirical bonus of 15 per cent, would most certainly lead the-the assistance of Lord Sydeuham, with a view to producing ascheme of co-ordination, but that this came to nothing.The Secretary reported that he had a number of papers dealingwith this subject, compiled by Colonel S win ton.The War Cabinet requested Lord Curzon to look into the question again and to report theresult of his investigations and any recommendations he desired to make to the Cabinet.
semi-skilled men to ask for a revision of their rates. It was truethat in certain shops the men who made tools were earning lessthan the men who used them, and that trainers were earning lessthan the persons taught; therefore he would favour giving a bonuson output to the instructors and providers of tools. His views wereshared by the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation and by trade unionists on the staff of the Shipyard Labour Department. Theproposal of the Ministry of Munitions for the first time introducedtwo new principles : (a.) It provided for a percentage increase on a purely arbitrarybasis which could not be tested on any economicground.(6.) It virtually admitted that the day-rates of men not working at piece-work speed should approximately be the sameas those now working at piece-work.Sir David Shackleton said that any percentage increase, suchas was now proposed, interfered with the relative position of time-workers and piece-workers, and raised pre-War controversies.Acting upon the Treasury agreement of 1915, the practice hadbeen not to allow these questions to go before the Committeeon Production. If the War Cabinet approved the publicationof the proposed Order, it would henceforward be impossiblefor the Ministry of Labour to resist appeals involving pre-Warcontroversies. The advance of 15 per cent, will disturb thedifference of roughly 33 per cent, which usually separated the earnings of the piece-workers and the time-workers. Disturb therelative positions, and the piece-worker will immediately ask that itbe restored, and the Gove:\nment will no longer be able to reply that these discrepancies have always existed. Further, there arecases where both skilled and semi-skilled are working on piece-work and where the latter are earning more than the former, owingto the nature of the work. If it be admitted that the time-workeris entitled to 15 per cent it will not be possible to resist the demand.to abolish or reduce the differences between the low-paid and high-paid piece-workers. He admitted that, a pledge having beengiven and the men informed, the Government had no alternativehut to proceed with the recommendations of Mr. Churchill, but he wished to point out the far-reaching wage conseqiiences of thedecision, ami the serious inroads on the couutry&apos;s finances whichwould inevitably follow.Sir Auckland Geddes said that there was observable a tendencyamong the skilled class of instructors and others to regard them-selves as the aristocracy of the engineering trade, and to split offafter the manner of a profession. From the recruiting standpointthis tendency to keep separate from the rank and file was to be welcomed, and if it were encouraged would be helpful.Major Hills supported the conclusions of the Committee over which he had presided. He was certain that grave discontent would follow any attempt to enforce payment by results from above. Thepiece-worker had moved far ahead oft he time-worker,fand the latter had a real grievance calling for remedy. A serious effort had beenmade by the Committee to make the proposed advance conditional,but such strong historical and sentimental forces were encounteredthat the attempt had been given up.Sir George Ask with endorsed the views set forth by Sir DavidShackleton. All piece-workers would wish to retain the normalrelative distance between themselves and the time-workers. Thedanger of a migration of men from one workshop to another hadbeen considerably discounted during the last two years by thearrangements which employers had already been forced to make.The total ultimate cost to the State of the abandonment of theprinciples now observed by the Committee on Production mightrun into hundreds of millions of pounds.
Mr. Churchill said that those who objected to his policy had no alternative to. offer which could be shown to be administrativelypracticable, There are great practical difficulties to the generalintroduction of a premium bonus system, or a system of bonus on output. A good system cannot be laid down by a central proclama-tion applicable to all shops, owing to the great variety of their arrangements. He wished to point out, with reference to thediscussion generally, that he was not bound to appoint a Committeeto consider the subject. It was within his statutory powers to grantor withhold the increase. He appointed the Committee because he wished the ground to be fully explored. The Departments which that day had objected to the recommendations of the Committeehad been represented on the Committee, and he was surprised tofind opposition at this stage.Sir David Shackleton said that the representative of theMinistry of Labour had withdrawn after attending one meeting.The Ministry of Labour thought the Terms of Reference of theCommittee had not been adhered to by the Committee, for theterms laid down that clue regard was to be had to the publicinterest both in the matter of expense and the increased output ofmunitions of war.Sir Alan Anderson said he would ascertain the circumstances in which. the representative of the Admiralty had signed theCommittee&apos;s report.Mr. Barnes thought that the objections which had been advanced were not so much against Mr. Churchill&apos;s actual proposal as against wider proposals which had been discussed by the Gom-mittee. It was not proposed to help a single man who was likelyto be put on piece-work. The rank and file of the engineers werenot concerned, but makers of gauges, tool-setters, and makers of plant. The objections put forward did not really lie against theworkers embraced in Schedule (C). He agreed that a collectiveoverhead bonus was the right principle, but we had forced the shops up to their maximum production, and, indeed, some to apoint winch could not be maintained because of the inroads whichhad been made on the health of women workers. The Governmentwas bound, in his opinion, to give the advance to the men who wereintimately connected with the high-wage-earning semi-skilled andunskilled workers.The War Cabinet were impressed with the difficulty of thesituation which had arisen in view of the Parliamentary pledge onthe one hand and the constant demands for increases of wages onthe other. Strong resentment would be felt in labour circles if theWar Cabinet rejected the recommendations of the Committee infavour of those of the employers who had withdrawn from theCommittee- Further, the War Cabinet was confronted with con-siderable diversity of opinion on the part of the Departmentsconcerned, in spite of the prolonged consideration which had beengiven to the subject by the Committee appointed by the Minister ofMunitions.The War Cabinet referred the question for decision to lord milner and Mr. Barnes, sitting with the Minister ofLabour and the Minister of Munitions, and requested themto meet that afternoon.Trade War: 13. The War Cabinet considered, a request from the FederationDenunciation of of British Industries that the Prime Minister should receive aCommercial deputation which would urge on the Government the importance of treaties. denouncing existing commercial treaties.
The War Cabinet decided that The deputation should be received after the Economic OffensiveCommittee had had an opportunity of considering thesubject, unless, in the meantime, Sir Edward Carson found it desirable to invite the Federation to make representa-tions direct to the Economic Offensive Committee.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,October 12, 1917.o
