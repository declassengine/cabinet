The agricultural programme:The Question ofMilitary Labour.1. THE War Cabinet bad a preliminary discussion on thequestion of food production, as proposed in Lord Milner&apos;s Memo-randum dated the 19th October, 1917 (Paper G.T.-2352). They alsobad before them a Memorandum by Mr. Long (Paper G.T.-2374).The President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheriesstated that there was an urgent need for 10,000 skilled ploughmen,who were required in batches of 2,000 at a time. notwithstanding the decision of the War Cabinet on the 13th July.(War Cabinet,184, Minute 12), the Army had not been able to release the skilledagriculturists required. It was understood that the men were notavailable in the Army at home.It was further pointed out that horses and ploughs were at this moment standing idle for lack of skilled ploughmen, and that the season during which they could best be used was rapidly passing.The War Cabinet decided that The larger question could not be discussed in the absence ofthe Secretary of State for War, but that the War office should make every possible effort immediately to release2,000 skilled ploughmen for agriculture, even if this involves taking them from Divisions at the Front whichare not required again to take part in the present offensive,or even if they could only be spared for a short furloughof two or three months.Oil Supplies.. 2. The President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheriesstated that further supplies of oil and paraffin were required foragricultural purposes, many of the machines being at present idlefor lack of these supplies. He asked that agriculture might bemade a war service for these purposes.Mr. Long said that agriculture had already received relativelylarge supplies of oil. As this question had arisen, he felt bound to warn the War Cabinet that the paraffin situation was serious. Atpresent there were only five weeks&apos; supplies in the country, andthere was no prospect of increasing these supplies. In London,Birmingham, and other great cities, kerosene was used by the poorfor heating, cooking, and lighting. Consequently, as the wintercame on the consumption would increase. To permit a shortage ofkerosene at a time when food supplies were short and prices high,would be to inflict great hardships on the poor, and to create a veryserious situation.The Oil Situationin England:Adverse division in Parliament onthe Petroleum Bill.3. With reference to War Cabinet 214, Minute 8, the WarCabinet consulted with their Ministerial colleagues in regard to thepolitical situation created by the defeat of the Government on theprevious evening in the House of Commons by a majority of 44 votes to 35.Notwithstanding that the majority was a small one, in an almostempty House, it was pointed out that the incident was not devoid ofpolitical significance, as it had been known beforehand that theGovernment would be challenged on this question, and the urgency of the matter had been mentioned in the &quot;Whip.&quot; Moreover, themajority included not only a number of members known to holdpacifist views, but some consistent supporters of the Government.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that the speeches ofthose who voted with the majority clearly showed that the objectionto the Government proposal was based upon the idea that a new form of property was being created, by the exigencies of the State,from which private landlords Would permanently gain profit Inhis view there were, two alternative courses of action possible to theGovernment; the first was, to accept the decision of the House ofCommons, not merely in the form of the amendment, which had
little or no influence on the Bill, but in tbe spirit, namely, to dropany idea of compensating landlords, and refuse to recognise anyproprietary right to the oil; or, secondly, to alter the form of the bill and provide compensation in some form other than that of royalty e.g., refer the question of compensation to the Civil Losses Corn-mission, or some other tribunal. The first alternative would callout the strong opposition of all property owners ; the second wouldinvolve the State in much larger payments than those contemplated in the Bill. He quite saw that it was difficult for their Labourcolleagues to support any compensation on a royalty basis. he added that, if the second course were adopted, the detailed arrange-ments for compensation could be settled when the Committee stagewas reached, provided that it was clearly understood that theprinciple of recognising the landlords right to compensation was admitted.Mr. Long stated that some Members who voted with the minority, though personally disinclined to favour royalties, had expressed the hope to him that the Government would take a firmstand now that the matter had been brought to a division. what had determined him, among other members of the Committee whohad examined the subject, to decide in favour of the royalty basisof compensation had been : (a.) What was the most profitable basis for the State ;(o.) The fact that during the last 18 months negotiations with several large landowners had been commenced by messrs. Pearson, and they had negotiated on the basis ofa royalty of 2s. per ton.He instanced the case of the Duke of Devonshire, who was probably the largest landowner concerned. It was thought that aconsiderable amount of oil might be proved to be recoverable fromhis property in Buxton, a place upon which the late Duke had spentvery large sums of money in development as a health resort, thewhole amenities and character of which were threatened by the projected oil operations. In his opinion, it was impracticable to limit the Bill to the duration of the war. The initial expenditureon plant was so great, and the boring was of so speculative a character, that contractors could not be induced to undertake the enterprise without some guarantee of permanence in the arrange-ments entered into. He did not think the House of Commons would agree to refer the matter to the Civil Losses Commission.General Smuts described the operation of the South AfricanMining Law, according to which the State becomes the owner of allunderground minerals and pays a certain percentage to the land-owner on all mineral recovered. In this way the ownership of the minerals was really vested in the State.Sir Frederick Lidded explained that the effect of the amend-ment carried in the House, namely, to omit the words &quot; into the petroleum Royalties Fund constituted,&quot; was to leave the resolutionsufficiently wide to cover all the clauses of the Bill, and that nowords need be inserted in their place to enable the resolution to read.Dr. Addison said that the paramount - consideration was toobtain the oil, and that, while he agreed with the Lord Advocate(Mr. Clyde) that subterranean liquid oil belonged to the State inthe same way as gold and silver, yet, in order to secure the oilrapidly, he was prepared to support the payment of a royalty of 9d.In reply to the assertion that the Bill was introducing a new form of private property, the Solicitor-General said that the exactopposite was the case ; the Bill in fact refrained from unsettling a principle which was now established, because in law the oil was theproperty of the landlord.Mr. Churchill reminded the Cabinet that six years ago the Boardof Admiralty had mapped out the potential oil-fields of the country,
that their existence was widely known, and that in the intervallandlords had been definitely approached with a view to the sale oftheir right.Lord Robert Cecil urged that, if possible, the settlement of theprinciple should stand over until the end of the war, and that mean-while an interim arrangement should be concluded which* did not prejudice the issue either way.It was pointed out that the right of entry to work the oil wasacquired under the Defence of the Realm Act, and that, after thewar, wayleave would have to be acquired by a further Bill.The Home Secretary agreed that the right of the landlord mustbe recognised, and favoured the reference of the question ofcompensation to a tribunal, e.g., the referees under theFinance Act.The Secretary for Scotland suggested that the question of what,if any, sum should be paid to the landlord, should be referred tothe Losses Commission. House of Commons criticism would bedisarmed if a judicial tribunal decided the matter, for in such eventcompensation would only be awarded if the existing law sanctioned,it, and no. new right on the part of the landlord would be created.Mr. G. H. Roberts said that strong objection was felt to themeasure because of its permanent character, and its passing wouldconfirm a principle which many of the Labour party stoutly contested.It would provide the party with a powerful political cry, and there-fore he thought the best thing would be to drop the Bill.Mr. Barnes stated that the working classes had a deep-seatedobjection to royalties. He personally would not object to continue for the period of the wrar on a basis of 9a1., but he would object to apermanent arrangement which would alienate from the State a new form of property and create a new vested interest.Sir Eric Geddes thought that a way out of the difficulty mightbe found by passing the Bill as a war measure for the duration ofthe war only, guaranteeing the approved licensees against any riskthey might run by reason of their finding themselves in the hands ofthe landowner after the war, after they had sunk large sums ofmoney in developing the industry.Sir Albert Stanley intimated that he understood that without aGovernment Bill it was unlikely that Messrs. Pearson would proceedwith anj- exploration of the oil deposits of the country.Mr. Illingworth strongly objected to any property or goodsbeing requisitioned without compensation.After hearing the discussion, the Chancellor of the Exchequerstated that he thought the wise course would be for the Governmentto stand by the Bill and to challenge the House of Commons as aAvhole upon it.The War Cabinet decided that The whole   question   should be  referred  to  the   following committee : Sir George Cave (in the Chair),Mr. Barnes,Mr. Walter Long,Mr. G. H. Roberts,Mr. Munro,Lord Robert Cecil, andOne of the Law Officers of the Crown.2, Whitehall Gardens, S,W.,October 26, 1917.
