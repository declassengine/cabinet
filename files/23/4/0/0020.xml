The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandum submitted by Mr. Montagu (Paper G.T.-2012), and decided that The arrangements suggested by Mr. Montagu should &apos; be approved, but that, before any announcement be made in public, the question of the representation of the IndiaOffice in the House of Commons should be settled and approved by the Prime Minister.Air Offensive. 4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported, withreference to War Cabinet 243, Minute 13, that the aeroplanesdetailed to assemble behind the French front for the purpose of air raids upon German towns had not yet reached Ouchy owing to bad weather. He added that very little flying was taking place in flanders owing; to the same cause.The Italian Front:Withdrawal of guns.Their Disposal.5. With reference to War Cabinet 243, Minute 4, the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff reported that, considerable delay had been experienced in getting under way the batteries sent to the italian front, but he anticipated that the last batteries- to leave the italian front would do so in about four days&apos; time. He had received atelegram from Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig informing him thathe could make valuable use of these batteries, and wished to havethem.
W.C. 246The War Cabinet decided that No alteration should be made in their previous decision withregard to the allocation of the batteries to other theatres ofwar.East Africa.6. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff consulted the WarCabinet with regard to a proposal received from General vanDeventer that, in the event of a few more successes, he shoulddemand formally the unconditional surrender of von Lettow. Thequestion arose as to whether any approach from our side would notbe regarded as an indication of weakness on our part.The War Cabinet decided that General van Deventer should, if possible, consult the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff before sending any suchmessage to the German commander.Treatment ofNatives [in german east Africa.&apos; 7. The question was raised as to why the native Askaris stuckso firmly to the Germans. In this connection the Chief of theImperial General Staff read an extract from General van Deventer&apos;telegram indicating that very strict discipline was maintainedamong them by the Germans.General Smuts stated that one of the main reasons was thatthe Germans kept hold of the wives and families of native soldiersserving with them, thus doing much to prevent any desertion.The Germans also asserted that, whatever the issue of the presentoperations in German East Africa, they will be able to reobtainpossession of this colony at the Peace Conference at the end of thewar, and that any natives who had deserted during the war w^ould be hanged by order of the German Government when the war was over.Salonica. 8. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that therehad been trouble between the French and Italian troops based onSalonica, the Italians desiring that their troops should be concen-trated on the left of the line, while General Sarrail insisted thatthe Italian troops should be placed between those of other nation-Personalities, as at present.Haidar Pasha 9  Wit]l reference to War Cabinet 242, Minute 1, the Chief ofExp osion. tjie Jxuperiai General staff reported that reliable information hadbeen received to the effect that a serious explosion at Haidar Pashahad in fact taken place causing very great destruction of ammuni-tion and military stores.The Roumanian 10. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that thereEront. wrere signs of enemy concentration on the Roumanian front, Austriantroops being replaced by Germans. On the other hand, theRussians reported a recent local success on the northern portion ofthis front.General Robertson stated that a serious telegram had beenreceived from General Barter vNo. 1292, dated the 5th October, 1917),stating that the Russians had failed to replace the foodstuffs taken from the Roumanians for their troops, and had also failed to deliverclothing and other stores promised by them to the Roumanians.In this connection the Prime Minister stated that he had receiveda personal appeal from M. Take J onescu.
The War Cabinet decided that This question should be referred for decision to Lord Milner,with a view to his taking whatever action was possible to urge the Russian Government to assist Roumania, and toascertain from the Roumanian representatives in thiscountry any means by which we could give assistance tothe Roumanians.Escape ofInterned german submarine fromCadiz.11. The First Sea Lord reported that.the interned german submarine had left Cadiz for the open sea unescorted, but apparentlypiloted. She could only have left with the connivance of theauthorities. The Admiralty had already consulted with the ForeignOffice with a view to making the strongest possible protest to theSpanish Government. The French Government had already taken action, asking for the dismissal of the Port Authorities, and statingthat they would hold the Spanish Government responsible for anyfurther depredations effected by the German submarine.Action with a 12. The First Sea Lord reported that H.M.S. &quot; Mantua &quot; hadFrench Sailing sunk an armed French sailing-ship by gunfire in the Bay of Biscay,Ship- mistaking her for a German raider.   One Frenchman had been killedon the sailing-ship, and six of the crew of H.M.S. &quot; Mantua &quot; hadbeen wounded.

Two enemy vessels were hit, one being set on fire, and an explosion caused on another.(c.) Eight Italian seaplanes had dropped 2J- tons of bombs onthe Austrian arsenal at Pola, and further bombs hadbeen dropped upon Prosecco, about four miles iSLN-W.of Trieste.Dunkirk.14. With reference to War Cabinet 242, Minute 10, the first sea Lord reported that the situation with regard to the anti-aircraft defences of Dunkirk was serious. Communications were beingmade to General Petain by the French Ministry of Marine with aview to securing their improvement.Eelease of guns for the Anti-Aircraft Defenceof London.15. The First Sea Lord reported that sixteen guns, destined forthe arming of merchant ships, had already been handed over bythe Admiralty to assist in completing the anti-aircraft defences ofLondon, and he anticipated the further release of twenty-two guns for this purpose from the Grand Fleet.In this -connection the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that the Italian aeronaut Laureati, who had recently flownto England from Turin, had reported to him that the night defencesof Venice had been most successful against raids by Austrianaircraft.
WC 246Committee on man-Power andRecruiting.16. The War Cabinet had before them a Report (paper g.T.-2147) of the Cabinet Committee on Man-Power and Recruiting,together with a memorandum by Mr. Churchill (Paper G.T:-2134).Sir Auckland Geddes pointed out that the decision with regardto the exemption of men employed in shipyards had been come toby the Committee on the representations made by the Admiralty.He had concurred in this decision, and did not anticipate that thenumbers of unskilled men who would be granted &quot; A &quot; certificatesby the decision come to would be large. He recommended that theWar Cabinet should confirm the decision.The War Cabinet confirmed the decisions contained in theReport (Paper G.T.-2147), directing that the Appendix to WarCabinet 231, Minute 9, should be reprinted (Appendix I) so as toinclude the amendments recommended by the Committee, and withregard to labour employed in shipyards decided that All recruitment or withdrawal of labour from shipyards for theArmy should cease so far as concerns all men employed inshipyards on or before the loth July, 1917, provided such men are still being employed in shipyards on the date onwhich the exemption certificate is granted to them, and provided that they have not engaged in any other employ-ment between the loth July, 1917, and the date of the certificate. Men complying with the conditions in theseprovisos shall be entitled to the same certificate as thosegranted to men employed in such yards on the 29th March,.1917. &apos; &apos;    .Prisoners of War 17. AVith reference to War Cabinet 238, Minute 8, the Warin Turkey. Cabinet had before them a summary by the Secretary of State forWar of the steps taken regarding British prisoners of war inTurkey (Paper G.T.-2171).Lord Newton stated that the only method of making progress was to secure an interview with the Turks. There were some indications that the Turks intend to accept our offer, but the matter was hanging fire. The Turks are reported, though not officially, tohave selected Mahmoud Mouktar Pasha and Bostani Effendi as their. representatives. Negotiations are being pursued through the swiss government, but, in view of the slow progress and the approach of winter, and the receipt of serious information that the Turks haveonl3r accounted for 4,00U to 5,0()O out of a total of 10,000 british prisoners, the remainder having probably died as a result of thetreatment they had received at the hands of the Turk, the WarCabinet were of opinion that further action ought to be taken. our last communication on this subject was made to the swiss government on the 22nd September, and, as no reply had yet beenreceived, the War Cabinet decided That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should send afurther telegram to Sir Horace Rumbold again pressing fora meeting, and stating that Lord Newton and GeneralBelfield are ready to start.Acceleration ofMerchantShipbuilding in theUnited States ofAmerica.18. With reference to War Cabinet 211, Minute 12, the WarCabinet had before them a draft of a proposed telegram to PresidentWilson, prepared by the Ministry of Shipping (Paper G.T.-2179),strongly urging the importance of. increasing and accelerating themerchant shipbuilding in the United States of America.The Shipping Controller read a telegram which had been sent by Lord Northcliffe to the Minister of Munitions, pointing out the246] O
Development ofShipbuildingResources.lack of co-ordination of statements by British Ministers in regard tothe submarine campaign.The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to a previoustelegram which had been sent to Lord Northcliffe (War Cabinet 203,Minute 9, and War Cabinet 210, Minute 1L), in which the questionof shipbuilding in America was dealt with.The Shipping Controller pointed out that about two months had elapsed since the despatch of that message, and in the meantimecomparatively little had been done. He strongly urged that theproposed telegram to President Wilson should be sent.After some discussion as to the particular channel through which the message should be conveyed to President Wilson, theWar Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should send atelegram to Colonel House for the information of thePresident, and that the Prime Minister should send a copyof it to Lord Ntorthcliffe, asking him to show it toSir Thomas Roy den. &apos;19. The War Cabinet had before them a copy of a letter fromthe Secretary of the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation to thePrime Minister (Paper G.T.-2186) in regard to the extension andfuller development of the shipbuilding facilities of the country,and the proposal to construct a number of national shipyards.In this letter it was requested that the Prime Minister should arrange to meet a deputation from the Federation at an early elateso that the matter might be discussed from every point of view.The War Cabinet decided that The deputation should be received by the Prime Minister, who should be accompanied by The First Lord of the Admiralty. 1The Minister of Munitions. jThe Shipping Controller.The Minister of National Service.The Controller of the Admiralty.The Controller of the Admiralty undertook to make all thearrangements for the meeting.Aerial OperationsCommittee.20. With reference to War Cabinet in, Minute 12, the WarCabinet resumed their discussion in regard to the recommendationof General Smuts&apos; Committee (Appendix II) that they should beempowered to settle all questions of priority not only of the presentair programme, but of all other munitions programmes.It was pointed out that if the Committee were given theseextended powers they would be in a position of very great controland would perform functions hitherto carried out only by the WarCabinet themselves in deciding the competing claims of the different departments. On the other hand, the position was safeguarded bythe facts that all the Departments concerned were represented onthe Committee, that there would be full liaison between the Com-mittee and the War Cabinet, both as regards the Chairman andthe Secretary of the Committee, and that, in cases of dispute, appeal .could be made to the War Cabinet.The War Cabinet decided  la mii*zpkm&amp;(a.) That the title of General Smuts&apos; Committee should be altered from &quot;Aerial Operations Committeie &quot;--to-&apos;&quot;&apos;war priorities Committee.&quot; s(&amp;.) That they should be given the extended powers as recom-mended by the Committee.
(c.) That their proceedings should be notified to the WarCabinet.(d.) That the decisions of the Committee should be notifiedregularly to the Ministry of National Service.Air Reorganisation. 21  With reference to War Cabinet 223, Minute 12, the WarCabinet had before them a memorandum by General Smuts(Paper G.T.--2222;, proposing the issue of the following notice tothe press : &quot; The War Cabinet decided during; the summer in favourof the principle of establishing a real Air Ministry and a unifiedAir Service into which both the Royal Naval Air Service and royal Flying Corps would be incorporated. A Committee&quot;presided over by General Smuts and a number of Sub-Com-mittees have been working out the detailed arrangementsrequired to give effect to that decision. A Bill embod3ring theGovernments proposals will be laid before Parliament at itsforthcoming session.&quot;The Prime Minister stated that he had had a conversation withMr. Holt ThOmas, who had interested himself for many years in thisquestion, and who had urged that the moment was not now favourable for the establishment of an Air Ministry, and that the presentsituation would best be mot by placing a member of the War Cabinetin charge of all aerial matters.It was pointed out that, while there had been no officialcommunique, there had been widespread discussion of the subject in the press, and the public were undoubtedly expecting theGovernment to set up an Air Ministry. Moreover, the War cabinet had themselves approved in principle the establishment of an AirMinistry (War Cabinet 22:&apos;, Minute 12).It was suggested that the best plan would be for General Smutsto continue to take charge of this question on behalf of the Cabinet,with such staff as he considered necessary, a course which would avoid a Bill in Parliament and the consequent loss of time. Therewere, however, objections to a member of the Cabinet being directly and deeply involved in anything like departmental executive action.Another possible course was for the Government to announce thatthey favoured the establishment of an Air Ministry and the unification of the Services concerned ; that to carry out this policy now wouldinvolve much dislocation and delay, which, in view of the urgentwar situation, it was desirable to avoid ; that for the present theWar Cabinet had therefore asked General Smuts to take general control of aerial policy.The War Cabinet decided To adjourn the discussion so as to allow General Smuts toexamine the sitbject further.22. AVith reference to War Cabinet 233, Minute 7, the WarCabinet authorised the President of the Board of Trade to arrangefor the issue of an amendment to Regulation 30 B B of the Defenceof the Realm Regulations, with a view to prohibiting British subjects in the United Kingdom from parting with mining and oil interestswithout a licence (Paper G.T.-2128).The President of the Board of Trade undertook to see that lord Cowdray was notified of the Governments decisionbefore any announcement was made.Base Metals:Alienation of mining PropertiesAbroad.
Patents and designs Bill andTrade MarksAmending Bill.23. The War Cabinet had before them the following docu-ments : A draft of a Bill to amend the Patents and Designs Act, 1907,with an explanatory memorandum by the Board of Trade(Paper G.T.-L734).A draft of a Bill to amend the Trade Marks Act, 1905, with an explanatory memorandum by the Board of Trade (EaperG.T.-1735).Sir Albert Stanley briefly explained the objects of &apos;the Bills,and said they were meant to deal with difficulties experienced in working existing Acts of Parliament. He hardly expected the bills to pass through during the forthcoming Session, but would be glad to have them introduced for the purpose of discussion.The War Cabinet authorised The President of the Board of Trade to introduce the Bills,after consultation with the Leader of the House ofCommons.Coal Miners&apos; Wagesand Price of Coal. 24. With reference to War Cabinet 240, Minute 10, the WarCabinet had before them a memorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade on the Cost of the Miners&apos; War Wage in Relation tothe Price of Coal (Paper G.T.-2213). It was estimated that thecost of the recent advance of Is. 6d. a day to adults and 9d. a day toboys would be approximately 22,0O0,OO0Z. per annum, and thequestion arose whether the whole or. any part of this amount shouldbe borne by the consumer or by the State. Of the present annual output (250,000,000 tons), about one-tenth was supplied to our allies, and the rate now charged to them was in excess of thatcharged to consumers at home. It was therefore, perhaps, unde-undesirable to advance the price to the Allies, but there seemed to beno good reason why the home consumer should escape the cost ofthe new advance in wages.The War Cabinet decided To authorise the Coal Controller to - increase the price of coal(except to Allies) generally by 2s. per ton.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,October 8, 1917.

APPENDIX II.G.T.-2178. -Aerial Operations1 Committee.(Memorandum by the Chairman.)THE War Cabinet at their meeting on the 21st September, 1917 (War Cabinet-237,Minute 6), decided that a Committee, composed as under: Genera] Smuts (Chairman),Sir Eric Geddes,Lord Derby,Mr. Churchill,Lord Cowdray,Major L. Storr (Secretary),should be assembled at once in order to enquire at the earliest date into the conditionsthat prevail in regard to the output of aircraft in this country, and to report to theWar Cabinet as soon as possible on the whole situation, giving their recommendations as to priority, and the effect that any priority, if granted, would have on the output ofthe Army and Navy, and in what direction.I append below an extract from the minutes of the first meeting of the committee held on 26th September, 1917, which gives the Committee&apos;s recommendations : The Committee took note of Mr. Churchill&apos;s statement,that, so far as he couldjudge at present, his Department would be able to complete the air programme without prejudice to the munitions programmes of the Admiralty and War office for the coming year, provided that sufficient raw material of all kinds and thenecessary labour were forthcoming.The Committee were of opinion, as the result of their discussion, that theycould most usefully perform the functions allotted to them if they Avere notconstituted as an ad hoc body, but became a standing Committee, which would, as occasion might necessitate, have preliminary discussions on any controversialpoints that might arise between the Departments concerned, and settle all questions of priority in regard to the completion of the present air and other programmes, and the extent to which the requirements of the other Departmentsmight be affected thereby, all questions not susceptible of solution by theCommittee beiug referred to the War Cabinet for final decision.The Committee decided To report to the War Cabinet in the above sense.I would invite the particular attention of my colleagues to the fact that theCommittee recommend that they should be empowered to settle all questions of priority, not only of the present air programme but of all other munitions programmes.If the War Cabinet decide to sanction this recommendation, I would suggest that the title of the Committee be altered from &quot;Aerial Operations Committee&quot; to &quot;war priorities Committee. &apos;(Initialled)   J.
