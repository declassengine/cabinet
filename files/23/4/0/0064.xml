THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that onthe 22nd November he had sent a telegram to Field-marshal sir Douglas Haig, warning him that, in exploiting his splendidsuccess at Cambrai, he should take into account the Italian situationand the unfavourable position regarding man-power. The Field-Marshal had since replied that, while he could hold the line just won,he had decided, in the existing circumstances, to take up a defensiveposition, which would involve a withdrawal from certain advancedpoints, which he indicated.The Cabinet authorised-The Chief of the Imperial General Staff to support Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig in his proposed action, which met with their entire approval.2. In reference to War Cabinet 289, Minute 1, the Chief of theImperial General Staff reported that, as the result of further enquiries, he had ascertained that a considerable proportion of the division en route to Italy, including battalions from different brigades,brigade headquarters, signal sections, &amp;c, had already reached Italy..
In these circumstances he felt that these must be recalled or thewhole division despatched. AThe War Cabinet decided that  w ;(a.) The division now en route to italy should complete itsconcentration in Italy ;(6.) In view of the military situation in the Cambrai region,the additional division under orders to proceed to italy should remain in France.3. Attention was drawn to the fact that the German forces inthe Cambrai region, although they had not achieved their entireobject, had gained a success which was inconsistent with the advice in regard to the strength and condition of the German Army whichhad been given to the War Cabinet by the Field-Marshal Com-manding-in-Chief, and it was suggested that the Commander-in-Chief in France was not well-advised on the Intelligence side of his staff.     .The Secretary of State for War undertook to consider thematter.Mesopotamia, 4. In view of  the greatly improved   military   situation   iiiPalestine. Mesopotamia, where the offensive plans of the Turks had broken down and their forces were at a considerable distance from theBritish, and of the fact that the number of British rifles in this theatre was more than treble that of the enemy, the Chief of the&apos;. &quot;&quot;&quot; &quot;&quot; Imperial General Staff advised the War Cabinet that the very largeBritish force which had been concentrated in that region in entirely different circumstances, might with advantage be reduced.;&quot;- &quot;      &quot;.&apos; The War Cabinet approved, the transfer of one Anglo-Indian; . v .     Division from Mesopotamia to Egypt.british expeditionary force:- &apos;&quot; - .Intelligence Staff.Archangel. 5. In reference to War Cabinet 289, Minute 11, the First sea lord stated that fie had received a telegram from the Senior naval officer at Archangel to the effect that the efforts of the pro-germans in Russia were obviously directed to causing a rupture between russia and her Allies. He generally supported the suggestion towithdraw the British officials from the interior to Archangel orMurmansk, and pointed out that for this purpose it would be neces-sary to send some Naval reinforcements to either port. The Firstik, - j &apos; .. ,- Sea Lord explained that the White Sea was closed, and that it was/;.:,; -.     -I&apos;.- impossible to send any vessel from England  to Archangel.    AtLL : .     &apos;     Murmansk there was already the battleship &quot;Glory,&quot; at present: only half-manned.    Half the crew were under orders to go out, and-...!. . he. had issued orders for it to take complete equipment of rifles,.   . machine-guns, and field guns.    At the same time, he wished toj .   .. explain that as the Russian naval force at Murmansk consisted ofi     . one battleship,, two cruisers, and four destroyers, and since the portwas surrounded by high hills, it would be impossible for a Britishvessel to maintain its position there in the event of opposition by theRussians.   If a point of refuge were required it would be necessary, to supply floating accommodation; it would also  be necessary tosend there transport from some other place.The War Cabinet decided that No action in this matter could be taken.&quot;&quot;Russia.   , &apos;; &quot; 6. In reference to War Cabinet -288, Minute 6, the War Cabinet.    further discussed the  demand of MM.  Trotzki and Lenin that&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;       &apos; 1 Tchitchirine and Petroff&apos;should be released-from internment, more
particularly in the light of telegram No.&apos; 1927 from the british ambassador at Petrograd, which indicated the probability, in theevent of this demand not being complied with, of reprisals beingtaken in the form of the internment of British subjects at presentconducting war propaganda work in Bussia in sympathy with the counter-revolutionary movement.It was stated that, according to the &quot; Daily News,&quot; Tchitchirinehad been appointed Russian Ambassador to Great Britain, and it was felt that this might be made a pretext, if he were not released, forthe arrest of Sir George Buchanan, and for picking a quarrel with theBritish Government.It was pointed out that the War Cabinet were in a dilemma.If attention was paid to the threats of MM. Lenin and Trotzki, aridnegotiations were consequently entered into with them, it would be tantamount to the recognition of the Bolshevik Government by theBritish Government. On the other hand, if no action were taken,there was real danger that the British Ambassador and Britishsubjects in Russia would run the risk of being interned and possiblystarved. An alternative was to deport both these men without any specific communication to the Bolshevik Government, and theSecretary of State for Home Affairs had already explained that, sofar as his Department was concerned, there was no objection to thiscourse. The objection to it was felt to be that such action would betaken by M. Trotzki to be a submission to threats, and would leadto renewed and more offensive demands.It was also suggested that a message should be sent to M.Trotzki to inform him that the British Government would deportthe two Russians in question if he would undertake not to oppressany of the British in Russia, or to inform him that the BritishGovernment had caused tbe arrest of MM. Tchitchirine and Petrofffor carrying out propaganda work against it, and realised the rightof the Russian Government to intern such British subjects as were working against it in a similar way in Russia.The War Cabinet decided that The best course for the present was to take no action.7. It was brought to the attention of the War Cabinet thatMr. King, M.P., had taken an active interest in the affairs of thetwo interned Russians, and that for a long time the questions put inParliament by this gentleman, as also those put by Mr. Outhwaite,M. P., were such as to be of value to the enemy, whether they wereanswered or not. At one time an attempt had been made zo collectall these questions, with a view to bringing the matter before the speaker.The War Cabinet decided that The attention of the House should be called to this matter.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,December 4, 1917.
