THE Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs hrought to theIllness of the notice of the War Cabinet a telegram (No. 979) which had been^ultan- received yesterday as to the serious condition of health of the sultan of Egypt, and stated that the question arose as to the succession in the event of his death. Two problems presentedthemselves : one was to retain the present system of a Protectorate ;the other was annexation. Mr. Balfour thought that Sir ReginaldWingate inclined towards annexation, but personally he thoughtthat a Protectorate was highly desirable, in view of internationalpolitics and the bad effect that annexation would have on the new[1365-236]
oKingdom of Hejaz, and the opportunities it would offer for propaganda on the part of our enemies. Mr. Balfour stated that ifthe present system was continued there were two relatives of thepresent Sultan who might be nominated to the Sultanship, namely,the brother and the son of the present Sultan. The son, whom the sultan would wish to succeed him, was reported to be a desirablepersonality, but pro-German and pro-Turk, and had on these grounds refused the succession when it, was previously offered.The brother, though not a great personality, was pro-British.Mr. Balfour stated that this was a matter that ought to be-settledbefore the death of the present Sultan, and that he had already discussed the matter with Lord Hardinge and Sir Bonald Graham,but that he had not had the advantage of obtaining the views ofLord Milner and Lord Curzon.The War Cabinet requested The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to obtain, if possible,the views of Lord Curzon and Lord Milner, but to com-municate again with the War Cabinet before taking anyother action.Education Bill. 2. The War Cabinet accepted the following formula put forward by Mr. EL A. L. Fisher (Paper G.T.-2O60), as regards higher education finance, and authorised the President of the Board ofEducation to state the same &quot; The Government feels that if these developments are tobe secured within a reasonable time a large part of the burdenmust be borne by the Exchequer. I am not: in position to give you a figure, but I am authorised to state that, in the viewof the Cabinet, the development of Higher Educationcontemplated under the Bill should be as liberally sub-subsidised by the Treasury as is compatible with giving to theLocal Education Authorities, upon whom it will devolve to administer the Act, an interest in its prudent and economicadministration.&quot;Co-operation of 3. Mr. Fisher raised the question of the co-operation of theAllied Universities. Universities of the Allied countries, and Mr. Balfour stated that whilst in the United States of America he had been approached onthis subject, both by Americans and by members of the FrenchMission.It was pointed out that, in the past, students from the UnitedStates had to a large extent gone&apos; to Germany for their education,where they had been welcomed and encouraged. It was now felt in the Allied countries that such procedure should in the future be discouraged, and that reciprocal arrangements should be made between the Universities of the Allied countries for the exchangeof students and professors.Mr. Fisher pointed out that as President of the Board ofEducation he had no jurisdiction over Ireland and Scotland, and accordingly suggested that if an invitation to a Conference was tobe sent to the Universities of Great Britain and Ireland it shouldbe issued by the Foreign Secretary.The War Cabinet requested -Mr. Fisher to draft some definite proposal on the subject, andto forward the same to Mr. Balfour for his consideration,and for such action as he thought fit in connection withthe Allied Governments.
WC 236Naval Losses. 4. The First Sea Lord reported that the destroyer &quot; Contest,&quot;while screening a torpedoed ship which belonged to an outward-bound convoy, had herself been torpedoed and sunk. There were apparently few casualties, but no detailed report had yet beenreceived.Steamship&quot; arab is.&quot;Aircraft for HomeDefence.A War BoardCommittee for supplies.5. With reference to War Cabinet 235, Minute 7, the First sea lord stated that the steampship &quot; arab is&quot; had fallen out ofthe convoy owing to machinery troubles, and not by reason of a foulbottom.6. The War Cabinet took into consideration a Memorandum bythe Chief of the Imperial General Staff (Paper G.T.-2008), relative to the supply of aircraft for Home Defence, in which it was pointedout that the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief Home Forcesconsidered that five day-flying fighting squadrons were necessary, andthat only three were at present complete.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that the two additional squadrons could not yet be supplied, but it was hopedone would be forthcoming in October, and the other in November,but this would obviously depend upon output and the demands ofthe Western front.Lord French stated that, though it was desirable to get the fivesquadrons complete as soon as possible, defence by day was not now considered to be of the same degree of urgency as night defence,and that experiments were being carried out. with a view to improving the latter.The War Cabinet decided that Inview of the serious situation arising in France consequent upon the improvement in the German Air Service, it was undesirable further to consider this question xrntil they had had the advantage of reading the Beport by General Smutson the Air Situation generally (War Cabinet 228,Minute (i).7. The War Cabinet, in view of the frequent demands whichcome before them for settlement, considered the question as towhether some organisation should not be instituted to co-coordinate the various demands which were made by the several Departments.It was felt that the proposed Inter-Allied Council would not meet this want, as it dealt primarily with material to be obtained fromthe United States. What was required was that certain membersof the Cabinet should be requested to act as a Committee, beingassisted by technical experts, in order to adjudicate upon all questions of priority in home production after due consideration ofwhat was being obtained from America and elsewhere.Sir L. Worthington Evans pointed out that a Priority Boardalready existed in the Ministry of Munitions, which exercised an elaborate control over the output of that Department.General Smuts undertook to place his views on this subjectbefore the War Cabinet, and consequently the matter w7asdeferred for later consideration.Supply of Steel 8. The War Cabinet had under consideration certain corre-Plates to Italy. spondence which had taken place between the Italian ambassador and the Ministry of Munitions, as set out in Paper G.T.-1957, withregard to the supply of steel plates to Italy.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew the attention ofthe War Cabinet to letters which had been received from our ambassador in Rome, pointing out the serious conditions thatprevailed and the action which would probably be taken by the
Germans in exploiting the economic condition of Italy with regardto their efforts for peace.The War Cabinet felt that we must adhere to our promise to supply, during the course of the year, the 40,000 tons of steel,but that if there were further requests for other commodities, suchas wheat, &amp;c, the opportunity should be taken to set the supply-ofsuch commodities against the agreed supply of steel, with a view toreleasing as much of the latter for our own shipbuilding, where itcould be more economically and expeditiously used ; and that inthe meantime the supply of steel plates to Italy should be continued at a slower rate than had been originally intended.In connection with this decision the War Cabinet requested The Shipping Controller to satisfy himself that any ships built in Italy with steel supplied from the United kingdom should, on completion, be put into Allied trade.9. Sir Eric Geddes stated that the Admiralty felt anxious withregard to the shortage of airships, that it was not so much an airmatter as a fleet matter, and that the scouting powers of the navy in a years time would be very seriously handicapped if some suchpolicy as had been put forward by the Admiralty in Paper G.T.-I912was uot carried out. An alternative, though not so effective, wouldbe a new programme for light cruisers, which would necessitate far more steel than was contemplated in the provision of the airshipsand their sheds now asked for, which had been reduced from 20,000tons to 14,000 tons, spread over a period of eighteen months.The War Cabinet considered that the airship policy should bedealt with in conjunction with our future aeroplane policy (see minute 6), and requested General Smuts to confer with the representatives of theAdmiralty and the Ministry of Munitions, and to putforward his recommendations, so that the matter could befurther considered by the War Cabinet at an early date.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,September 19, 1917.
