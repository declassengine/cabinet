With reference to War Cabinet 274, Minute 17, the WarCensorship of Cabinet had before them a letter written by Mr. Herbert SamuelLeaflets. on behalf of members of the late Cabinet, objecting to the Defenceof the Realm Regulation which specified that leaflets must be&quot; submitted to and passed by &quot; the Press Bureau (Paper G.T.-2820), together with remarks by the Home Secretary (Paper G.T.-2865).Sir George Cave explained that widespread objection hadbeen taken in the newspapers to this provision, and a deputation
of the Labour Party had protested to him against empowering aiiofficial to forbid the issue of a leaflet although not offendingagainst the Regulations. It had in fact been found inconvenientto exercise the power, as there were pamphlets which could notwell be stopped, but to which it was undesirable to give officialsanction. He did not object to the omission of the words, subjectto provision being made for the submission of every leaflet to thePress Bureau seventy-two hours before its printing, publication,or distribution, but he would like Regulation 27 strengthened byinserting words which would make it an offence to spread reportsor make statements intended &quot; directly or indirectly to impedeor interfere with the successful prosecution of the war.&quot;The War Cabinet decided (a.) To approve the proposal of the Home Secretary that thewords objected to should be omitted, and that wordsshould be inserted requiring a leaflet to be submittedto the Press Bureau seventy-two hours at least before it was printed, published, or distributed.(&amp;.) To postpone the proposal that Regulation 27 should be strengthened as suggested above. Reliance should beplaced for the.present on existing Regulations, but sir george Cave was authorised to indicate to the Houseof Commons that the Government might find it neces-sary to apply the new proposal.Aircraft warfare and PublicMuseums.2. The War Cabinet approved proposals by Sir Alfred Mondand Mr. H. A. L. Fisher for the removal to some place of safety of the most precious treasures contained in the Record Office, theBritish Museum, and the principal public museums and galleriesof London and its neighbourhood (Paper G.T.-2873).The War Cabinet authorised The First  Commissioner of Works to instructBureau to avoid publicity in this matter.the PressPortugal.3. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff called attentionto telegram No. 477, dated the 6th December, 1917, from theBritish Minister at Lisbon, reporting a movement by the portuguese-guese Army against the Government. The movement was alleged to be monarchist and pro-German.Extension ofBritish Line on western Front.4. With reference to. War Cabinet 292, Minute 7, the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff stated that he had circulated corre-spondence between Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig and general petain, with a covering Minute by himself, on the question of theextension of the British, front (Paper G.T.-2884), which he askedmight be discussed&apos;on Monday next, the 10th December, 1917.The western front,    .5. With reference to War Cabinet 292, Minute 8, the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff stated that he had circulated atelegram from Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, dated the 6thDecember, 1917, dealing with the recent German counter-attack inthe Cambrai region. The enemy&apos;s main attack was on BourlonWood, with seven divisions. This failed completely, with heavyloss. Three enemy divisions attacked the Marcoing area and alsofailed, with heavy loss.

With reference to War Cabinet 283, Minute 4, the WarCabinet authorised The Chief of the Imperial General Staff to inform Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig that they sanctioned hisretention of two batteries of 60-pounders due to go toItaly, in view of the recent loss of guns in the CambraiThe Invasion ofItaly.7. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported thatGeneral Fayolle had asked General Foch for two more french divisions for the Italian front, and that General Foch, in turn,was pressing for the despatch of the British divisions which hadbeen countermanded. The Italians had. on the previous day,sustained a reverse at the hands of the Austrians, who had driventhe Italians back three or four miles on a four-mile front. Thefighting had been severe and the losses heavy, but General Plumerthought the retirement should be onhr local. He said there wereample troops ready in reserve. These consisted of eight Italiandivisions, and four French divisions.The War Cabinet authorised The Chief of the Imperial General Staff to reply to general foch that the situation had changed, and, owing to the threat to our positions at Cambrai, the War Cabinet had decided not to send the sixth division at present, the fifth to continue its movement.Command of anglo-french troops in Italy.Suggested Rehi-f orcement of theSerbian Army byJ ugo-Slav prisoners in Italian hands.Russia :vladivostock.8. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the WarCabinet that General Fayolle had suggested to General Foch thatBritish troops should be put under his command. It appeared,however, that General Fayolle&apos;s army had now been placed, &quot; for establishment purposes,&quot; under General Petain.It was pointed out that General Plumer was a very senior officer, who had for a long time had command of an army, andthat the British force, when the five divisions arrive, will contain65 battalions as against 54 French battalions.The War Cabinet decided against any alteration of thepresent arrangement.9. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to a telegramaddressed by the Foreign Office to Sir Rennell Rodd, urging him tomake representations to the Italian Government, with a view to thelatter giving facilities for the release of Jugo-Slav prisoners intheir hands, for the purpose of providing volunteer reinforcements for the Serbian Army.10 With reference to &quot;War Cabinet 293, Minute 10, the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff stated that he had examinedCommander Locker-Lampson/s project, which was similar to theproposals discussed at the recent Inter-Ally conversations at the paris Conference, for the occupation of Vladivostock with a view[1365-294]B 2been foreseen, and ample preparations had been made todeal with it, but our outposts apparently failed to givewarning to other troops in rear, with the result thatthese were surprised. The cause of the failure of the out-posts to give warning was being investigated. The estimated number of missing to date, including casualties unrecorded, was between 9,000 and 10,000. and there were 150 guns missing andunrecovered.
to the control of the Siberian Railway by American or japanese forces.   He proposed that (a.) The Japanese, and perhaps the Americans, should beasked to send a force to Vladivostock, for police pur-poses, for the protection of military stores there, and,later, if necessary, to obtain control of the Trans-Siberian Railway and open up communication with south Russia.(&amp;.) If possible, a small British Naval force should be sentto Murmansk to protect our stores there and to providerefuge for Entente nationals.(c.) Definite encouragement should be given to the Govern-ment of TiUis, and an endeavour should be madeto constitute an Armenian Army, which should begiven financial support. Armenians in Russia to begot down to the Caucasus.In this connection, attention was drawn to a telegram fromthe British Minister at Peking (No. 591, dated the 6th December,1917), recounting a meeting of Allied Ministers at which it hadbeen decided to ask the Chinese Government to send a military force to protect foreigners at Harbin, where the Russian general was co-operating with the local Leninist Government, and wherea situation was developing which, unless checked, might issue in placing North Manchuria under enemy control. This telegram had been repeated to Tokio.The War Cabinet considered whether the seizure of Vladivos-tock by Japanese or American forces, in order to protect the storesthere, might not do more harm than good, by strengtheningRussian opposition to the Allies even, among the most friendlysections of the population, and might even jeopardise the lives ofthe British Ambassador and other British subjects in Russia.Similar apprehensions had been expressed in Russia lest the recentdemarche of the Military Mission should imply an intention to letloose the Japanese against Russia. There was a real danger that russia might not only make peace with Germany, but also mightbe provoked by us into fighting with the Germans against us. Onthe other hand, an ambiguous and uncertain policy towards the bolshevist Government was also fraught with serious disadvan-tages. ,The Secretary reminded the War Cabinet of the decision taken at Paris, with the approval of Colonel House, to enquire atWashington and Tokio as to suitable measures which might betaken to protect the Trans-Siberian Railway and to supply food toRussia.*The War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should send tele-grams to Washington and Tokio, calling attention to the paris decision and to the further information received asto the position in Russia and China, and asking if theconditions were thought favourable bv either Governmentfor the despatch of a police force to Vladivostock.* Extract from Note-: of Paris Conference, December 3, 1917. &quot;General Fochsubsequently put forward the following resolution as embodying&apos; the decision of tbeConference: &quot; Les representants de la Graude-Bretagne, delTialieet de la France, reunisa Paris le 3 decembre, 1917, aveo les representants des ]Stats-Unis et du Japon,arretent, apres examen de la situation actuelle en Russie, que les repr^sentantsde ces deux dernieres Puissances demanderont sans retard a leurs Gouvernementsdes directives en vue cVassurer le ravitaillement de la Enssie par la Transsiberien,et de prevoir des a present les moyensde nature a faire ariiver ces ravitaillenients,me me en cats de troubles.&quot;   (I.C. 35 (c) p. 4.)Question of Eecallof Ambassadorfrom Petrograd.11. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read telegramNo. 1965 from Petrograd, referring to the fact that Lenin, in his
appeal to Moslems, was openly inciting our Indian subjects torevolt. Sir George Buchanan proposed laying the British case before the Russian public by means of a press interview. this might lead to a rupture with the Bolshevik Government.The question was raised whether it would not be desirable to anticipate the crisis which was evidently approaching by with-drawing the Embassy and leaving the protection of British interestsin the hands of the Consuls.The War Cabinet authorised The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to send a telegram to Sir George Buchanan inviting his opinion, after con-su Ration with his colleagues of the Allied diplomatic corps, as to whether the Embassy should be withdrawn;corresponding telegrams to be sent to the Allied Govern-ments.Finland.12. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theWar Cabinet that His Majesty&apos;s Government was being urged to-recognise the independence of Finland.It was pointed out that the Finns had a grievance against theBolsheviks, that they were a separate nationality, that Finlandmight afford a country of refuge for the British in Russia, andthat Germany would probably give the desired recognition. Sir-George Buchanan had replied that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould recognise the independence of Finland if the Russian Consti-tutional Assembly approved.The War Cabinet endorsed the Ambassadors view.Russia:General Policy.13. It was suggested that the many questions arising out ofthe state of affairs in Russia would be easier of settlement if th -policy of the Allies Avas more clearly defined.   It was open to thAllies-(a.) To recognise the Bolsheviks and make the best arrange-- meats possible with them; or(b.) To refuse to recognise them, and take open and energeticsteps against them.It was also suggested that a decision should be taken as to therelease of the two interned Russian agitators, who, it was explained, had been interned for spreading Bolshevist propagandaamong Clyde workmen.It was pointed out that His Majesty&apos;s Government hadalready undertaken risks in getting in touch wdth General Kaledinand with the Ukraine, and offering financial help.Armenia.14. The War Cabinet authorised The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to render suitablefinancial help, through channels to be chosen by himself inconsultation with General Macdonogh, to the Armenians.Armoured Oars.15.
